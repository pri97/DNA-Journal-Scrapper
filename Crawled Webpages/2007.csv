IntroductionConceptual and technological developments in molecular cytogenetic techniques are now enhancing the resolution power of conventional chromosome analysis from the megabase to the kilobase level. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), i.e. the application of CGH to an array of genomic fragments such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), has been the method of choice for genome-wide copy-number analysis in the last few years.1,2 The density of the various ‘whole-genome’ BAC clone sets commonly used varies from one clone per Mb3–5 to an overlapping clone set covering the entire human genome with one clone per 100 kb.6,7 Array CGH has rapidly become an important genome analysis tool in cancer research,8–10 in the identification of novel microdeletion syndromes and gene identification studies,11–15 in the diagnosis of patients with congenital malformation syndromes and/or unexplained mental retardation,5,16,17 and in prenatal diagnosis.18,19 Although disease-causing genomic alterations are thought to be rare, recent work using high-resolution microarray approaches has indicated that genomic copy-number variation without immediate phenotypic consequences is widespread throughout the entire human genome.17,20–23Most currently used genomic copy-number profiling microarrays are produced in academic settings, and the resolution of these microarrays varies depending on the type and number of genomic targets selected, the protocols used, and the data-analysis tools employed. Only recently, private enterprises embarked on this novel microarray application, and several companies are now offering microarrays for genomic copy-number profiling. Most of these microarrays encompass 25–85-mer oligonucleotides targeting random genomic sequences24–26 or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).27–31 The theoretical advantages of using such commercial platforms are numerous: (1) they provide a higher genome coverage than most microarrays generated in academia, (2) they can be produced in large quantities according to industrial quality standards, (3) they are available to all researchers, also those without dedicated microarray facilities, and (4) their widespread use will generate large comparable data sets that facilitate data comparison and cooperation between research groups. At present, however, little is known about the actual performance of these platforms, and first-time users will find limited guidance on which platform is most appropriate for their applications and requirements. Although various platform comparison studies have been reported for microarray-based expression profiling,32–35 as yet a comprehensive platform comparison for genomic profiling, including an adequate statistical power analysis, has not been reported.A prerequisite for a performance comparison of genomic microarrays is the availability of a comprehensive method that accounts for specific requirements associated with genomic microarray data such as adjacency of probes and asymmetric y-axis measurements associated with deletions and/or duplications. Here, we introduce a method that adheres to these requirements, and that is based on statistical power calculations to compare the practical resolution of individual genomic microarray experiments obtained using different microarray platforms. The method is validated using simulated data sets as well as data sets obtained using our in-house tiling-resolution BAC arrays and commercially available 100k SNP, 250k SNP, and 385k oligonucleotide microarray platforms. From our results, we conclude that the increased probe density of the commercially available microarray platforms, although accompanied by a lower signal-to-noise ratio, results in a higher genome-wide copy-number detection resolution.2. Methods2.1. Patients and healthy donorsThe platform comparison was performed using DNA from 13 patients harboring submicroscopic genomic copy-number variations previously identified by tiling-resolution array CGH.17 Genomic DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes by standard procedures. Male and female reference DNA pools previously used for tiling-resolution BAC array analysis were also used for hybridization to the NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarrays. These reference pools contain equal amounts of genomic DNA from 10 healthy donors (males or females). For the Affymetrix SNP oligonucleotide microarray experiments, using single color hybridizations, two male and two female reference pools were used for normalization purposes.2.2. Tiling-resolution BAC array CGHPreviously, we reported an array CGH study17 using a tiling-resolution microarray encompassing 32,447 overlapping BAC clones selected to cover the entire human genome.6,7 Hundred patients with unexplained mental retardation were hybridized in duplicate against a sex-mismatched reference pool to this microarray. On the basis of these hybridizations, we selected 13 patients with validated submicroscopic copy-number variations, both single copy-number gains and losses, for hybridization to the other platforms.2.3. Affymetrix 100k SNP arraysThe Affymetrix 100k SNP array contains 25-mer oligonucleotides representing a total of 116,204 SNPs, distributed over two microarrays. Array experiments were performed according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) as described previously.27 Copy-number estimations were determined using the recently published software package CNAG (Copy Number Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 100k arrays28). This algorithm strongly improves the signal-to-noise ratios of the copy-number data by (1) accounting for the length and GC content of the polymerase chain reaction products using quadratic regressions and by (2) normalizing the patient samples to reference samples run in parallel.2.4. Affymetrix 250k SNP arraysAffymetrix provides two microarrays each containing approximately 250,000 SNPs, and together forming the 500k assay. For this study, we selected the Nsp 250k SNP array, which contains 262,264 25-mer oligonucleotides. For the 100k SNP array experiments, the 250k SNP array experiments were performed according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Copy-number estimates were determined using the CNAG software package,28 which was recently updated for the analysis of these arrays (version 2.0).2.5. NimbleGen 385k oligonucleotide arraysThe NimbleGen whole genome oligonucleotide microarray contains 386,165 isothermal probes (45–75-mer), spanning the human genome at a mean probe spacing of 7 kb. Isothermal oligonucleotide design, array fabrication, DNA labeling, CGH experiments, data normalization, and log2(Cy3/Cy5) copy-number ratio calculations were performed by NimbleGen according to published procedures.262.6. Hidden Markov analysisThe normalized ratios were analyzed for loss and gain of regions by a standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which was optimized for each of the microarray platforms in order to maximize the detection of the known validated copy-number aberrations, while minimizing the false-positive rate, as described before.172.7. Statistical power analysisFor each of the four microarray platforms, we performed a statistical power analysis of adjacent targets surrounding a specific locus on a chromosome. This revealed the relationship between the genomic length of the copy-number variation, the noise contained in measurements, and, ultimately, the false-positive and false-negative detection rates for the microarray, and thus, provided a platform-independent discrimination statistic describing the ability of a microarray to detect single copy-number variations.The statistical power analysis comprises the following steps: (1) Determination of the distribution of the noise,(2) Establishment of estimates for significant changes and the variance of noise within each experiment,(3) Calculation of the number of data points required for detection of copy-number variations, and(4) Determination of the resolution of a microarray platform.The method assumes a normal distribution of noise within the copy-number data. We used a χ2 goodness-of-fit test,36 using a p-value of less than 0.05, and could not reject this hypothesis, thereby justifying the application of the method used for calculating the statistical power.We calculate the number of data points required to detect a genuine single copy-number variation (as estimated by the mean chromosome X values) given the autosomal standard deviation, with a confidence factor determined by the desired statistical power. This is done by determining the number of data points required to lie in the outer regions of the distribution of the copy-number ratios for it to be deemed unusual in terms of the expected (normal) distribution. We use the non-central T cumulative distribution in order to determine the number of sample points required to satisfy the desired power given estimates of significant changes and an estimate of the variance.38,39To calculate the resolution of a microarray platform, the outcome of the power analysis is used in conjunction with the genomic coverage of the platform. The distribution of the microarray probes throughout the genome is determined by the size of the gaps between the microarray targets. For our calculation, we take into account the uneven genomic distribution of the microarray targets and assume that copy-number variations can occur randomly throughout the whole genome. Next, we create a window with size equal to the number of data points required to detect a copy-number variation, as given by the power calculation, and determine the number of instances within the genome where the window has a size less than the size of the variation to be detected. This is compared to the total possible number of windows that occur within the genome. By doing so, we create a genome-wide probability that a copy-number variation with a particular size independent of its genomic location will be detected by a microarray platform. We calculated the resolution for single copy-number variations with genomic sizes ranging from 10 kb to 1 Mb, separately for gains and losses.3. Results3.1. Study designIn this study, we assessed the capacity of various genomic microarray platforms to detect submicroscopic single copy-number variations, including deletions and duplications. We selected samples from 13 patients in which we have previously identified and validated copy-number variations using our in-house produced tiling-resolution 32k BAC arrays.17 These samples were hybridized onto 100k Affymetrix SNP arrays, 250k Affymetrix SNP arrays, and 385k NimbleGen oligonucleotide arrays. As an example, Fig. 1 shows the chromosome profile obtained for the various platforms in a patient with a 0.54-Mb sized deletion at 9q33.1. We applied a standard HMM algorithm to automatically detect copy-number variations onto the different platforms. Next, we developed and tested a novel method based on statistical power analysis for an objective comparison of the detection resolution of the different platforms.Detection of known and validated submicroscopic copy-number variations by high-density BAC, SNP, and oligonucleotide arrays.

This figure also shows the different levels of microarray noise present for the different microarray platforms.3.2. Automatic detection of copy-number aberrations by HMMIn order to obtain independent information on the performance of the different microarray platforms in identifying submicroscopic copy-number variations, we applied a single automated HMM algorithm to the experiments performed in this study (see Table 1). The known and validated copy-number changes were previously identified on the 32k BAC microarray platform,17 and ranged in sizes from 230 kb to 8.9 Mb. Samples from 10 patients were tested on the 385k NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarray platform, and all of the previously identified and validated copy-number variations were detected by the automated HMM algorithm. In contrast, two of the previously identified and validated copy-number variations out of the 13 tested were not automatically detected on the Affymetrix 100k SNP array platform. One of these was a 350 kb deletion on chromosome 7q11.21 (Patient 5), and the other was a 1.65 Mb deletion on chromosome 15q24 (Patient 11). The HMM algorithm correctly detected 10 out of 11 previously identified and validated copy-number variations on the Affymetrix 250k SNP microarray. Again, the 350 kb deletion on 7q11.21 could not be detected automatically, whereas the 1.65 Mb deletion on 15q24 was readily detected on this platform. In addition to the known and validated copy-number variations, a large number of additional copy-number variations was detected but not validated.Detection of known and validated submicroscopic copy-number variations onto high-density BAC, SNP and oligonucleotide microarraysaAll copy-number variations were initially detected by an automated HMM on the 32k BAC array.Detection of known and validated submicroscopic copy-number variations onto high-density BAC, SNP and oligonucleotide microarraysaAll copy-number variations were initially detected by an automated HMM on the 32k BAC array.3.3. Verification of power calculation using simulated dataIn order to verify the power calculation, we created a step function of a single copy-number loss based on our model for an aberration and corrupted it with a noise signal that had a normal distribution to simulate a single copy-number loss (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The results of the power analysis on this data set are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 1B. This analysis shows that a minimum of four data points with log2 ratios outside the normal distribution is required for a single copy-number loss to be detected with the desired power (95%). Subsequently, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to test the behavior of the power calculation. We artificially generated 400 samples of size 4 under the null hypothesis with a mean of 0, and another 400 with a mean resembling a loss, which represents the alternate hypothesis. The results of this analysis are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1C, where the null hypothesis converges to the expected 5% and the alternative hypothesis to 95%. This analysis shows that the power calculation is effective in determining the required data points for the successful detection of a copy-number variation.3.4. Power calculation on experimental dataAfter having verified the power calculation, and having confirmed that the distribution of the experimental noise was normal (Supplementary Fig. 2), we applied this method to the experimental data set described above. For each sex-mismatched experiment, we calculated the mean of all unique chromosome X log2 ratios and the standard deviation of the autosomal log2 ratios to provide an initial insight into the performance of each microarray platform and the values to be used in the power calculations (Table 2). The average log2 ratios of these chromosome X targets were similar for the BAC array platform and the Affymetrix SNP array platform (∼0.47), whereas the NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform exhibited a lower average of approximately 0.38. The average standard deviation of the log2 ratios of the autosomal targets varied twofold between the different microarray platforms. The 32k BAC platform exhibited the lowest standard deviation, and the 385k NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform the highest. In addition, as all BAC array hybridizations were performed in duplicate, we were able to determine the influence of replicate analyses on the noise level. As can be seen in Table 2, the autosomal standard deviation is reduced by almost 50% after averaging data from two experiments.Signal-to-noise parameters of the four genomic copy-number profiling platformsaMean log2-transformed test-over-reference ratio of the X chromosome, excluding the pseudo-autosomal regions, obtained from calculations in sex-mismatched hybridization experiments. For the BAC and the NimbleGen platforms, data were obtained within each two-color experiment, for the Affymetrix SNP platform, data were combined in silico from different one-color experiments. For this analysis, four reference pool samples (two of each sex) were processed in parallel with the patient samples.bStandard deviation calculated over the log2-transformed test-over-reference ratios for all autosomal targets, excluding the genomic regions known to harbor submicroscopic copy-number variations.Signal-to-noise parameters of the four genomic copy-number profiling platformsaMean log2-transformed test-over-reference ratio of the X chromosome, excluding the pseudo-autosomal regions, obtained from calculations in sex-mismatched hybridization experiments.

An average of four adjacently located BAC clones showing a single copy-number loss provided 95% confidence of representing a true copy-number variation. A similar power for detection of a copy-number loss required, on average, five consecutive SNPs on the 100k platform, four SNPs on the 250k platform, and eight consecutive oligonucleotides on the 385k platform. The reliable detection of a single copy-number gain required more consecutive targets, as could be expected based on the theoretical log2 ratio difference between a single copy-number loss (−1) and gain (0.66). For the 32k BAC and for the 100k and 250k SNP array platforms, this increase was moderate, with one to three additional targets being required, respectively. For the 385k oligonucleotide platform, this increase was considerable, i.e. at least twice as many targets were required for reliable detection of a single copy-number gain (Fig. 2).Result of the power analysis of the four genomic microarray platforms for detection of a single copy-number gain or loss contained by different numbers of consecutive targets. The resulting power for a single copy-number gain (dotted) and a single copy-number loss (line) are displayed for the 32k BAC array platform (A), the 100k SNP array (B), the 250k SNP array (C), and 385k oligonucleotide array platform (D). The increase in number of targets has a varying impact on the resulting power across the four different microarray platforms. In addition, the number of consecutive targets required to detect single copy-number gains differs considerably from the number of targets needed to detect a single copy-number loss, and this difference appears to be platform-dependent.Result of the power analysis of the four genomic microarray platforms for detection of a single copy-number gain or loss contained by different numbers of consecutive targets.

This resulted for each platform in a probability to detect a single copy-number gain or a loss throughout the genome with a size range from 10 kb to 1 Mb and a desired power of 95%. From this analysis, it can be concluded that (1) high-density oligonucleotide/SNP-based platforms are significantly better in detecting copy-number variations below 1 Mb than the BAC array platform, (2) copy-number variations smaller than 100 kb remain difficult to detect even onto these high-density platforms, despite an average target spacing of 7, 12, or 30 kb, and (3) small-sized single copy-number gains are much more difficult to detect than single copy-number losses of the same size.Probability to detect a single copy-number gain or loss with different genomic sizes onto the four platformsThis table combines the results from Table 3 with those of Supplementary Table 2.

DiscussionWe have developed a novel method for establishing the practical resolution of a genomic microarray to detect copy-number variation and applied this method, based on statistical power analysis, to three commercially available microarray platforms and to our in-house BAC microarray platform. For each platform, we calculated the number of adjacent targets required to reliably detect a single copy-number variation (gain or loss), given the required minimum rate of false-positives and false-negatives. On the basis of this calculation, we determined the probability of detecting copy-number variations of different sizes onto a genomic microarray, taking into account the number and genomic position of all targets on the microarray platform used. This unbiased resolution statistic is an important performance measure for genomic microarray platforms as well as for individual microarray experiments, which had not been established for genomic microarrays before. Previously, the resolution of a genomic microarray could only be judged by the mean spacing of targets, a measure that solely reflects the overall genomic coverage. The results of our power analysis, however, clearly demonstrate that the level of noise and the sensitivity of copy-number measurements co-determine the practical resolution. In addition, our analysis revealed an unexpected platform-dependent difference in sensitivity to detect a single copy-number loss and a single copy-number gain. Accurate performance measures are important for researchers to gage the sensitivity and specificity of individual experiments or different platforms. Also, in a diagnostic setting, where microarray-based genome profiling is rapidly being introduced,17,30 it will be essential to have a robust estimate of the practical resolution of the genome-wide scan.Several platform comparisons have been performed for gene expression microarrays.32–35 The statistical methods described in these studies, however, cannot be used for genomic microarrays as they do not account for various intrinsic aspects of genomic microarrays such as the adjacency of targets and the difference between detecting a single copy-number loss and a single copy-number gain. Several statistical methods have been developed for different aspects of genomic microarray analysis, such as preprocessing (normalization17,28), automatic detection of copy-number variations,40,41 and the analysis of Type I errors across genomic microarrays obtained from multiple experiments and samples.42 Here, we report on a resolution statistic for genomic microarrays that uses an approach based on hypothesis testing and statistical power calculations. The method is based on the following variables: (1) the genomic coverage of the platform, (2) an estimate of the noise in the microarray experiment (the standard deviation of the autosomal targets), (3) an estimate of a single copy-number loss (ratio of the chromosome X unique regions of sex-mismatch experiments),37 and (4) the desired statistical power. The method requires a normal distribution of the noise, which was confirmed by a χ2-test, thereby allowing the use of the T distributions. We validated our method using a Monte Carlo technique to simulate the Type I and Type II detection errors for a single copy-number loss, requiring a statistical power of 95%. These simulations were in agreement with the calculated Type I and Type II errors resulting from a two-sided t-test. The calculations yielded the minimal number of required adjacent targets at each locus in order to detect a single copy-number variation, taking into account the required statistical power.36,43 By combining the genomic location of targets with the minimally required sample size, we obtained an objective genome-wide resolution statistic.We used our method to characterize the detection performance of the four genomic microarray platforms using experimental data from 13 samples with submicroscopic copy-number variations hybridized to the different platforms. Automatic copy-number analyses detected the large majority of known submicroscopic copy-number variations on all genomic microarray platforms. Two genomic variations were not detected by the 100k SNP array platform, due to poor SNP coverage for these regions, a problem reported also by others44 (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). This can be reduced by simply adding more targets for these regions. Indeed, one of the two variations was identified automatically by the 250k SNP array. This analysis also revealed considerable and reproducible differences in signal-to-noise ratios between the different platforms. Signal-to-noise ratios were highest for the BAC array platform, which may be due to a more robust hybridization performance of larger genomic fragments as compared to the smaller targets used for the other platforms. The Affymetrix SNP arrays containing only 25-mers, however, showed signal-to-noise ratios which were only slightly lower than the BAC array platform after data normalization using the CNAG package.28 It should be noted that no such data preprocessing was performed for the NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform which displayed the lowest signal-to-noise ratios. This may indicate that preprocessing of the data can have a significant effect on the detection resolution of an individual genomic microarray experiment and argues for a significant effort to be made in this field of genomic microarray data analysis.45 In addition, the noise in a genomic microarray experiment can be significantly reduced using replicate analyses, as was shown for the BAC array platform.The statistical power analysis indicated that, on average, four consecutive BACs are required for the reliable detection of a single copy-number loss, five for the 100k SNP array platform, four for the 250k SNP array platform, and eight consecutive oligonucleotide probes for the NimbleGen 385k oligonucleotide platform. These numbers are markedly different for the detection of single copy-number gains (see Fig. 2). This is caused by the fact that the theoretical ratio of a single copy-number gain (three vs. two copies) is much closer to the random noise level than a single copy-number loss (one vs. two copies). Therefore, it is relatively difficult to discriminate between a true copy-number gain and random experimental noise. This poses a serious problem for those platforms that display a high noise level. The estimate for a single copy-number loss on the NimbleGen oligonucleotide platform is − 0.38 and that for a single copy-number gain is 0.22, within one standard deviation of the mean (0.23 for this platform, see Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). As a consequence, reliable detection of a single copy-number gain on this platform requires 10 consecutive oligonucleotides more (18) than detection of a single copy-number loss (8). In contrast, the detection of a single copy-number gain on the BAC array platform with the lowest noise level requires only one consecutive clone more (5) than that of a single copy-number loss (4). These results demonstrate the impact of the different detection limits regarding single losses and gains, resulting in more targets being required in the latter case.46 It is important to account for this asymmetric detection limit caused by the different signal-to-noise ratios associated with gains and losses.The commercially available microarrays contain 3 to 12 times as many targets as our tiling-resolution BAC microarray, and this can compensate for the lower signal-to-nose level obtained on these platforms. In addition, the targets on these microarrays are much smaller in size as compared to BAC clones with an average insert size of 170 kb, thereby theoretically allowing the detection of aberrations below 100 kb. Table 4 shows the probability of detecting a single copy-number gain or loss with different genomic sizes onto the four platforms. This table clearly shows that the commercial platforms outperform the BAC array platform for the detection of aberrations below 1 Mb in size. The Affymetrix 250k SNP array appeared most sensitive for the detection of copy-number variations below the 100-kb level, especially for copy-number gains. However, even on this platform, the probability of detecting a single copy-number gain with a genomic size of 50 kb was only 38% (68% for a single copy-number loss). A similar analysis was performed in silico for the 500k SNP array platform by assuming that the 250k Sty array shows a similar sensitivity and noise distribution as the 250k Nsp array used in this study. This calculation indicated for the 500k SNP array that the probability of detecting a single copy-number loss or gain with a genomic size of 50 kb was 87 and 72%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). This shows that even these high-density platforms will have significant difficulties in detecting single copy-number variations smaller than 100 kb. As stated above, the use of replicate measurements and/or improvements in data preprocessing can significantly improve the sensitivity of the different genomic microarray platforms.Next to performance, many other factors, including the availability and consistency in quality of microarrays over time, the amount and quality of input DNA required, the price, and the access to a microarray facility or service company, may affect the choice for a certain microarray platform. An important advantage of using a widely available commercial platform is that it facilitates data exchange between research groups. In addition, the production of arrays containing more than a hundred thousand targets is not practically achievable for academic groups, especially since most currently available microarray spotters have a practical limitation of ∼60,000 spots per slide. An important bonus of using SNP arrays is that it allows genotyping together with CGH. This provides additional information such as copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity. Initial SNP selection against regions with a high frequency of copy-number variation in the population, however, has recently been shown to impact the detection of this specific form of copy-number variation on these platforms.44 Besides Affymetrix and NimbleGen, companies such as Agilent and Illumina have also developed high-density genomic microarrays that can be used for CGH applications.24,31In conclusion, we present a straightforward statistical method for establishing the practical resolution of an individual genomic microarray experiment. Application of this method to different genomic microarray platforms clearly shows that these platforms vary in their capacity to reliably detect copy-number variations of different sizes and different types. This should be taken into account for estimating the practical resolution of a platform to detect genomic copy-number variations.The authors thank Rolph Pfundt, Bert de Vries, and Han Brunner for useful discussions and critical proofreading of the manuscript.

IntroductionCyanobacteria grow in diverse habitats on earth, ranging from the tropics to polar regions.1 Terrestrial cyanobacteria are subjected to repeated cycles of dehydration, desiccation, and rehydration, and can survive under desiccated conditions for long periods. It has been reported that a terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc commune, which was stored in a desiccated state for more than 100 years, retained its ability to grow.2,3Nostoc commune cells actively deactivate their photosynthetic systems on sensing water loss,4 and can recover the activities of photosystems I and II readily after rehydration.5Nostoc commune cells produce a large amount of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), which contributes to the stabilization of the cells during desiccation.6 Light intensity and the availability of combined nitrogen affect the synthesis of soluble EPSs in Nostoc strains.7,8 Despite many studies of the mechanism of desiccation tolerance, the molecular responses of cells to dehydration, desiccation, and rehydration remain unclear.A sigma factor for RNA polymerase is capable of specific promoter recognition and the efficient initiation of transcription. Environmental or developmental signals change gene expression by inducing sigma factors in diverse bacterial species.9 There are two basic families of eubacterial sigma factors based on sequence similarities: the σ70 and σ54 families. The σ70 family is divided into three groups. Group 1 contains the primary sigma factors, which are essential for cell growth. Group 2 contains the sigma factors that are not essential for cell growth, but are similar to the primary sigma factors in the amino acid sequences of their DNA-binding regions. Group 3 includes the sigma factors that are only slightly homologous to groups 1 and 2 in their amino acid sequences. They regulate the transcription of specific regulons expressed in response to changes in environmental or developmental conditions. No sigma factor of the σ54 family has been found in the cyanobacteria. Twelve putative sigma factor genes exist in the genome and plasmids in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.10 However, there have been few reports of the corresponding functions of the sigma factors. sigA, which encodes a primary sigma factor, was isolated and characterized under conditions of nitrogen limitation.11 The transcripts of the sigB and sigC genes, which encode group 2 sigma factors, are detectable under nitrogen-limited conditions.12 However, neither gene is essential for nitrogen fixation or heterocyst differentiation.13 The functions of the group 3 sigma factors of the PCC 7120 strain have not been reported at all.We recently reported a comparative analysis of the differences in gene expression during dehydration between the terrestrial desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. HK-01 and the aquatic cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120.14 The gene expression changes were transient in Anabaena PCC 7120, whereas in Nostoc sp. HK-01, they were maintained or increased until the wet weight decreased to 10% of that before drying. Therefore, we inferred that sigma factors play important roles in gene expression during dehydration, because sigma factors play key roles in the initiation of transcription and gene expression. Here, we analysed the changes in the expression levels of the sigma factor genes in both Nostoc sp. HK-01 and Anabaena PCC 7120 during dehydration. We present significant evidence that sigJ gene plays an important role in desiccation tolerance.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsTransformant cells of Anabaena PCC 7120 were grown in BG11 medium15 at 30 °C under continuous illumination at 30 µE m−2 s−1 provided by fluorescent lamps. Nostoc sp. HK-01 was grown at 30 °C in WK medium16 with 5 mM N-tris-(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulphonic acid (TES)–NaOH (pH 8.0) under continuous illumination at 30 µE m−2 s−1 provided by fluorescent lamps. Liquid cultures were bubbled with air containing 1% CO2.2.2. Drought stress conditionsA 10-mL portion of cell culture was harvested by filtration on a filter paper at a chlorophyll concentration of 15 µg chlorophyll/mL and dried on a plastic dish in an incubator under light (30 µE m−2 s−1) at 30 °C and 30–40% relative humidity. The cells were cryopreserved when the wet weight had decreased to 50, 30, and 10%, and cells harvested immediately before drying (100% wet weight) were used as the control.2.3. Total RNA preparationTotal RNA was isolated from prepared cells by the hot-phenol method.17 Crude total RNA was treated with 0.1 U/μL DNase I (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) at 37 °C for 3 h. After phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the total RNA was suspended in RNase-free ultrapure water.2.4. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reactionAliquots (1 µg) of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with an RNA PCR Kit (Takara Bio). An aliquot (1/20) of the reaction mixture was taken for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a set of gene-specific primers (Table 1). Reactions were performed with a DNA Engine Opticon® 2 System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara Bio) in the presence of 250 nM primers under the following conditions: 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The fluorescence intensity of the SYBR Green dye was measured after each amplification step. The relative ratios were presented as the means of data from duplicate or triplicate experiments. The primers used were designed using Primer3.18 Each primer for the sigma factors of Anabaena PCC 7120 was designed based on information from CyanoBase. Each specific primer for the sigma factors of Nostoc sp. HK-01 was designed on the basis of partial sequencing data using PCR products amplified with primers based on the conserved DNA sequence of the corresponding gene among Anabaena PCC 7120, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. Each datum for Nostoc sp. HK-01 was normalized to the value for 16S rRNA. Because the amount of transcript product of the 16S rRNA gene decreases as dehydration progresses in Anabaena PCC 7120, the quantitative determination was based on the amount of total RNA measured with a spectrophotometer. The primers are listed in Table 1. Product identification was confirmed by melting-curve analysis.Primers used in real-time quantitative RT–PCRPrimers used in real-time quantitative RT–PCR2.5. Construction of transformantsThe plasmid used for transformation in this study was based on pRL490, a stable shuttle vector in Anabaena species derived from a hybrid of pBR322 and the plasmid pDU1.19–23 pRL490 contains the tac promoter derived from Escherichia coli, the luxAB genes derived from Vibrio fischeri downstream from the promoter, and a gene conferring resistance to neomycin. The luxAB genes were removed from the plasmid with BamHI restriction endonuclease. The resultant plasmid was named pRL490–luxAB. DNA fragments of the sigJ gene were amplified by PCR with the set of primers 5′-GGATCCATGGCAGCAAGTGAGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTATGAACCAGTAGGCAT-3′ using the genomic DNA of Anabaena PCC 7120 as the template. The primer set was designed to allow the introduction of a BamHI restriction site. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of the DNA fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. The fragment digested with BamHI was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of pRL490–luxAB to construct pRHE0277. pRHE0277 was transferred by conjugation into Anabaena PCC 7120 according to Elhai and Wolk24 and the transformant HE0277 was selected for resistance to neomycin. The control transformant P490 was obtained by transferring pRL490–luxAB into Anabaena PCC 7120 as described above.2.6. Test for recovery from desiccationP490 and HE0277 cells grown in liquid culture to stationary phase (OD750 = 3.0 ± 0.3) were filtered on a cellulose acetate membrane filter (Toyo Roshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), dried for 10 h under light (30 µE m−2 s−1) at 30 °C and 30–40% relative humidity in an incubator, and stored for 1 week in the dark in the incubator. These dried cells were soaked with BG11 medium for 10 min. After the cell densities were adjusted (OD750 = 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01), the cell solutions were spread on an agar plate with BG11 medium and incubated under continuous light (30 µE m−2 s−1) at 30 °C.2.7. DNA microarray analysisDNA microarray analysis was performed according to Ehira and Ohmori.25 The analysis was conducted using three sets of total RNA samples extracted independently from the cells of P490 and HE0277. The ratio of the transcript level of the HE0277 strain relative to that of P490 strain was calculated from three measurements. Open reading frames (ORFs) whose spots showed signal intensities of more than twice the average intensity were analysed.2.8. Extraction of EPSsCells (OD750 = 3.3 ± 0.3) and culture media were separated by centrifugation. This separation step was repeated three times. The harvested cells were resuspended in 0.05% sodium tetrahydridoborate solution and boiled at 100 °C for 1 h. The polysaccharide contents of the culture media and cell surfaces of the P490 and HE0277 cells were determined by the phenol–sulphuric acid method, using glucose as the standard.263. Results3.1. Sigma factors responsive to drought stressTo determine the relationships of the sigma factors of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 to those of other cyanobacteria, we aligned the sigma factor amino acid sequences from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, and A. variabilis (ATCC 29413) and constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has one representative of the group 1 sigma factors, SigA; group 2 sigma factors, SigC, SigD, and SigE; and group 3 sigma factors, SigF, SigG, and SigI. The multiple paralogues of SigB, a group 2 sigma factor, have been classified as SigB (All7615), SigB2 (Alr3800), SigB3 (All7608), and SigB4 (All7179). sigB2 is encoded on the chromosome, whereas sigB, sigB3, and sigB4 are encoded on plasmids. A novel type of group 3 sigma factor was isolated and designated SigJ. Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 possesses a SigJ-type sigma factor, Alr0277, but not SigH-type sigma factor.Phylogenetic analysis of the sigma factors of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, A. variabilis ATCC 29413, Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803 from CyanoBase; and the sigma factors of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 from CYORF.We analysed the expression of the sigma factor genes during dehydration in Anabaena PCC 7120 (hereafter Anabaena) and Nostoc sp. HK-01 (hereafter Nostoc) using a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) method (Table 2). Anabaena has 12 putative genes for sigma factors on its chromosome and plasmids: nine genes exist on the chromosome and three genes on plasmids. We analysed the expression of the sigA (all5263), sigB2 (alr3800), sigC (all1692), sigD (alr3810), sigE (alr4249), sigF (all3853), sigG (alr3280), and sigJ (alr0277) genes on the chromosome of Anabaena and that of the corresponding genes of Nostoc. No expression of sigB (all7615), sigB3 (all7608), or sigB4 (all7179) was detected before or during dehydration in either species. sigI (all2193), which encodes a probable sigma factor, was not analysed because it is not a common gene in filamentous cyanobacteria. No orthologue exists in the genome of A. variabilis ATCC 29413 or N. punctiforme ATCC 29133. The transcript levels of sigA decreased as dehydration progressed in both Anabaena and Nostoc. However, the transcript level decreased to only about 53% in Anabaena, whereas it decreased to 13% in Nostoc when the wet weight had decreased to 50% of that before dehydration (Table 2).Alteration of sigma factor gene expression during dehydration evaluated by real-time quantitative RT–PCRThe ratio values were obtained by calculating the ratio of the transcript level at each wet weight to the transcript level at the wet weight (100%) immediately before drying. Each datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.Alteration of sigma factor gene expression during dehydration evaluated by real-time quantitative RT–PCRThe ratio values were obtained by calculating the ratio of the transcript level at each wet weight to the transcript level at the wet weight (100%) immediately before drying. Each datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.The transcript levels of several group 2 sigma factors decreased totally as dehydration progressed in Anabaena. The transcript levels of sigC and sigD continued to decrease during dehydration. Transcript levels of sigB2 and sigE finally decreased, although they increased transiently at a wet weight of 50%. Conversely, the transcript levels of group 2 sigma factors increased significantly in Nostoc. The transcript levels of sigB2 and sigC were maintained at approximately twofold higher than the control level until the late stage of dehydration. The transcript levels of sigD and sigE were significantly increased, although transiently, at a wet weight of 30%.In Anabaena, the transcript levels of several group 3 sigma factors did not change until the mid-stage of dehydration and decreased markedly in the late stage of dehydration. In Nostoc, the transcripts of sigF were strongly repressed until the mid-stage of dehydration. The transcript level of sigG was maintained at a level over twofold higher than that of the control in the late stage of dehydration. The transcript level of sigJ increased significantly in the mid-stage of dehydration, and then decreased gradually in the late stage of dehydration. It is noteworthy that among the sigma factor genes, the expression of sigJ was upregulated first when the cells were exposed to drought stress.3.2. Comparison of the transcript levels of each sigma factor in Anabaena and Nostoc during dehydrationThe relative ratios of the transcript levels for each sigma factor in Anabaena and Nostoc were determined during dehydration using real-time quantitative RT–PCR (Table 3). The ratios for sigC, sigE, and sigG transcripts in Nostoc to those in Anabaena were approximately 100-fold, 10-fold, and 30-fold, respectively, at the late stage of dehydration. The relative ratio for sigJ was approximately 120-fold, even before drying, and the maximum ratio was approximately 1550-fold at a wet weight of 30%. The intensive expression of the sigJ gene in Nostoc should positively influence desiccation tolerance.Relative ratios of the transcript level of each sigma factor gene at each wet weight in both Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Nostoc sp. HK-01The value was calculated as the ratio of the transcript level of each sigma factor gene in Nostoc sp. HK-01 to its transcript level in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Relative ratios are the means of data from two independent experiments.aTranscript levels were very low in both species and the error margins of the calculated values were large.Relative ratios of the transcript level of each sigma factor gene at each wet weight in both Anabaena sp.

Recovery from desiccation of P490 and HE0277 cellsA transformation method for cells of Nostoc sp. HK-01 has not been established. Therefore, we produced clones of the Anabaena cell strain HE0277, which strongly express the Anabaena sigJ gene, and tested their recovery from desiccation based on the facts that the expression of sigJ was the first among the Nostoc sigma factor genes to be upregulated by drought stress and that sigJ transcripts exist more abundantly in Nostoc than in Anabaena. The cell strain transformed with a non-insertional pRL490–luxAB vector was used as the control strain, P490. As the result of Western blotting with anti-SigJ sera, the translation product level of sigJ in HE0277 cells was fourfold higher than the control level (data not shown). The HE0277 cells were better able to recover from the desiccated state than were the control cells (Fig. 2). Therefore, the numbers of colonies formed, as an indicator of recovery from the desiccated state, were determined for both strains when spread on a BG11 agar plate, after cell density was adjusted (OD750 = 0.01). From the results of eight measurements, the number of colonies formed by the HE0277 strain was 3.1-fold higher than that of the P490 strain (data not shown). Thus, the HE0277 cells were more desiccation-tolerant than the P490 cells.Recovery from desiccation of P490 and HE0277 cells. P490 and HE0277 cells were dried as described in Section 2. After the cell densities were adjusted (OD750 = 1.0, 0.1, and 0.01) using BG11 liquid medium, the cell solutions were spread on agar plates with BG11 medium and incubated for 7 days under continuous light (30 µE m−2 s−1) at 30 °C.Recovery from desiccation of P490 and HE0277 cells.

Effects of higher expression of the sigJ gene in AnabaenaThe effects of the elevated expression of the sigJ gene were determined with an Anabaena oligonucleotide microarray. We found that the expression of 112 genes, including sigJ, was upregulated and that the expression of 42 genes was downregulated in HE0277 cells relative to that of P490 cells. Among the upregulated genes, 5% or more of the entire number of genes were included in the categories ‘cell envelope’, ‘photosynthesis and respiration’, ‘transcription and regulatory functions’, and ‘other categories’ (Table 4). The genes encoding probable glycosyl transferase or glucosyl transferase in ‘other categories’ accounted for 14.4% of the total number of upregulated genes. There were no particular features of the downregulated genes (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 1).Functional categories of genes differentially expressed in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsaGene categories were defined according to the CyanoBase database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html). sigJ is excluded from this table.Functional categories of genes differentially expressed in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsaGene categories were defined according to the CyanoBase database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html). sigJ is excluded from this table.The details of the upregulated genes in HE0277 cells compared with those in the P490 cells are shown in Table 5. There are two gene clusters upregulated in the HE0277 cells. First, the gene cluster encoding ORFs all4003–asl3998 was uniformly upregulated. The isiA (all4001) encodes the chlorophyll-a-binding protein CP43′. isiB (alr2405), which encodes flavodoxin, an electron carrier that can substitute for iron-rich soluble ferredoxin, was also upregulated.27 Second, the expression of the gene cluster from alr3057 to alr3074 was uniformly upregulated in HE0277 cells. Because the upregulated expression of alr3074 was not statistically significant, it is not included in Table 5. However, the fold value (HE0277/P490) was 1.79 ± 0.27, indicating a tendency to upregulation. This region contains 18 ORFs and is 22.1 kbp long. According to CyanoBase, many genes relating to polysaccharide biosynthesis are included in this cluster.Effects of higher expression of sigJ gene in Anabaena sp.

Analysis of the EPSs of HE0277 and P490 cellsBecause a proportion of the genes were categorized as ‘cell envelope’ encoding, and the number designated glycosyl/glucosyl transferases was comparatively large relative to the entire number of genes upregulated (approximately 20%), we considered that the amount of EPS was increased in HE0277 cells. Each EPS in the P490 and HE0277 cells was collected from the cell surface and liquid culture, and analysed as described in Section 2. Significant differences were detected in the amounts of polysaccharides released into the culture medium, although no difference was detected in the amounts of cell-surface polysaccharides (Table 6). The amount of polysaccharides released by HE0277 cells was as much as 3.2-fold higher than that released by P490 cells.Comparative analysis of EPSs in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsEach datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.EPS, extracellular polysaccharide.Comparative analysis of EPSs in P490 and HE0277 cell strainsEach datum is an average (±standard deviation) of three independent experiments.EPS, extracellular polysaccharide.4. Discussion4.1. Role of sigma factors in drought stressThe expression of the sigA gene was repressed as dehydration progressed in both Anabaena and Nostoc. The sigA product regulates the transcription of a number of housekeeping genes and is principally involved in cell viability. Genes related to photosynthesis, carbon dioxide fixation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, transcription, and translation are downregulated under desiccation.28 The transcript level of sigA in Nostoc was strongly repressed at the mid-stage of dehydration (Table 2). It is necessary to stop cell processes during dehydration to conserve the energy needed to survive under desiccation. It is reasonable that Nostoc strictly controls the transcription level of the sigA gene to ensure survival.Expression of the group 3 sigma factor gene, sigJ, was responsive to drought stress at the earliest stage of dehydration in Nostoc. The relative ratio of the number of transcripts of the sigJ gene in Nostoc to that in Anabaena was more than a hundred (Tables 2 and 3). The elevated expression of the sigJ gene must enable the cells of Nostoc to respond to drought stress in a timely manner. The higher expression of the sigJ gene in Anabaena resulted in the upregulation of genes related to polysaccharide biosynthesis (Tables 4 and 5), suggesting that SigJ governs the regulons of EPS biosynthesis. The expression of the gene cluster from alr3057 to alr3074 was upregulated in the HE0277 cells during dehydration, whereas it was downregulated in the desiccation-sensitive Anabaena.28 This gene cluster might be responsible for desiccation tolerance.In the drying phase, cells avoid lysis from hyperosmotic-down shock and protect their DNA, RNA, proteins, and membranes from water stress, oxidative stress, and other stresses.29,30 It was considered that the upregulation of isiA and isiB expression in HE0277 cells, which are induced under conditions of light excess, iron-limited conditions, and oxidative conditions,31–34 is an example for desiccation tolerance. Genes regulated by the group 2 sigma factor RpoS of E. coli and the group 3 sigma factor SigB of Bacillus subtilis, which are general stress-responsive sigma factors, encode various functions that are involved in the prevention and repair of DNA damage, cell morphology, modulation of virulence genes, osmoprotection, thermotolerance, glycogen synthesis, membranes, and the cell envelope.9,35 However, sigJ gene is not the only sigma factor gene that responds to drought stress. Other group 2 or group 3 sigma factor genes of Nostoc are also responsive to drought stress in the late stage of dehydration (Tables 2 and 3). The function of the sigma factors in drought stress seems to differ from that of SigJ. Further analysis of the sigma factors is required to elucidate the desiccation tolerance of Nostoc species.4.2. Significance of exopolysaccharides in desiccation toleranceIn the HE0277 strain, genes putatively concerning polysaccharide biosynthesis were upregulated, and at the same time, polysaccharides were excreted increasingly into the culture medium (Table 6). We investigated the monosaccharidic composition of the released polysaccharides produced by HE0277 and P490 cells. The dried polysaccharides were hydrolysed, neutralized, and desalted, and the monosaccharides were then quantified by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography, as described previously.36 The polysaccharides released by both HE0277 and P490 cells were composed of eight kinds of identified monosaccharides (galactose, glucose, fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid) and several unknown monosaccharides (data not shown). No difference in monosaccharidic composition was detected between the HE0277 and P490 strains. The amount of each monosaccharide in the polysaccharides released by HE0277 was two- to threefold greater than that released by P490. Many studies have been carried out to determine the function of EPSs in the capacity of some polysaccharide-producing cyanobacteria to overcome desiccation in the desert.37 It has been proposed that EPSs provide a repository for water, thereby acting as a buffer between cells and the atmosphere, and represent the key component of the mechanism used by cyanobacteria to tolerate desiccation.38 The EPSs of N. commune account for more than 60% of its dry weight.6 The polysaccharides, together with trehalose, may play a key role in dehydration tolerance.39 It has been reported that photosynthetic O2 evolution in EPS-depleted N. commune cells is sensitive to desiccation treatment, whereas that of normal N. commune cells is rapidly recovered after rehydration.40 Because HE0277 cells produced and released polysaccharides in increased amounts (Table 6), the polysaccharides must be a critical factor in desiccation tolerance. The group 3 sigma factor gene sigJ is fundamental to desiccation tolerance.

IntroductionThe last decade has seen remarkable advances in structural analysis of model plant genomes. The complete whole-genome sequence data of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa have been published together with the predicted gene structures and annotations,1,2 and the draft genome sequence of a model tree Populus trichocarpa (Torr. & Gray) was recently disclosed.3 Two leguminous plants, Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen and Medicago truncatula Gaertn., are also subjects of genome sequencing programs.4 The post-sequence functional genomic approaches to legumes will be important to uncover new functions of legume-specific genes and to establish the systems biology of legumes. At present, non-targeted approaches are mainly used for legume functional genomics. The EST macro-array analysis of L. japonicus became available recently.5 Data mining by multivariate analyses of the integrated data of transcriptomics and metabolomics is expected to facilitate our understanding of the physiology of legumes, as is being accomplished with A. thaliana.6 On the other hand, targeted approaches, that is, focusing on the genes of particular families or particular pathways, are practical to assess the functions and structures of individual genes, and thus they will complement the non-targeted ones.The legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid pathway is one of the targets for functional legume genomics. 5-Deoxyisoflavonoids have two distinctive structural features: the B-ring attached to C-3 of the C-ring and a hydrogen attached to C-5 instead of a B-ring at C-2 and a hydroxyl group at C-5 in general flavonoids. To the best of our knowledge, no 5-deoxyisoflavonoid has been found in any plant other than the Leguminosae. About 95% of isoflavonoids are found in legumes, and 60% of leguminous flavonoids are 5-deoxy series flavonoids.7 Some isoflavonoids, particularly those with pterocarpan and isoflavan skeletons, are typical leguminous phytoalexins active in the defense response against phytopathogenic organisms,8 while an isoflavone (daidzein) functions as a signal molecule toward symbiotic rhizobia to establish nitrogen-fixing root nodules in the soybean.9Vestitol, an isoflavan phytoalexin of Lotus and other leguminous genera, is postulated to be biosynthesized from the phenylpropanoid precursor by a total of 11 enzymes (Fig. 1). The cDNAs encoding 10 of the 11 enzymes have been identified from L. japonicus or other leguminous plants;10–18 the exception is 7,2′-dihydroxy-4′-O-methoxyisoflavanol dehydratase, which has been purified from M. sativa,19 but for which no sequence data is available. We have reported the induction of vestitol accumulation by treatment with reduced glutathione (GSH)20 and the structures and functions of paralogous genes encoding catalytically distinct chalcone isomerase (CHI) isozymes of L. japonicus.21 The findings on the genes for CHI, together with those for dihydroflavonol-4-reductase22 of the general flavonoid pathway and oxidosqualene cyclase23 in the triterpenoid biosynthesis, suggest the functional diversification of the multigene families, due to gene duplication, followed by the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions.21General and legume-specific flavonoid pathways in L. japonicus.

The gene identification was based on a biochemical assay using heterologously expressed enzymes, comparison of the gene structures, and the phylogenetic relationship. The results offer reasonable gene annotations and genetic markers for comparative and functional genomics of legumes, as well as insights into the molecular evolution of the legume-specific biosynthetic genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome structure and genetic mappingGeneration of genomic libraries of L. japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen accession Miyakojima MG-20, sequence strategy, and gene assignment were carried out as described elsewhere.24 The libraries were screened for each gene by the PCR method using primer sets based on the sequences of the cDNAs isolated (Table 1). Putative genes for chalcone synthase (CHS) were in part discovered in the course of the whole-genome sequencing program of L. japonicus.25 Genetic mapping was carried out with the simple sequence repeat markers found in each TAC clone.26Primers used for screening of L. japonicus genome libraries and/or RT–PCR analysisaCommon primer for the amplification of PKR1 and PKR4 cDNAs.bCommon primer for the amplification of PKR5 and PKR6 cDNAs.cCommon primer for the amplification of IFR1 and IFR2 cDNAs.dCommon primer for the amplification of VR1 and VR2 cDNAs.Primers used for screening of L. japonicus genome libraries and/or RT–PCR analysisaCommon primer for the amplification of PKR1 and PKR4 cDNAs.bCommon primer for the amplification of PKR5 and PKR6 cDNAs.cCommon primer for the amplification of IFR1 and IFR2 cDNAs.dCommon primer for the amplification of VR1 and VR2 cDNAs.2.2. Functional characterization of paralogous genesmRNA was isolated from 4-week-old whole plants of L. japonicus accession Gifu B-129 using the Straight A's mRNA isolation system (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). Single-strand cDNAs were synthesized using Superscript II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). To amplify the full ORF of 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase 2 (IFS2, GenBank accession no. AB279984), a primer set was designed based on the genomic sequence: 5′-AAGATCAAACAAAGCTTATGTTGGTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GAAATCTAGAAGGTTATTTGTGTTGTACTT-3′, which included HindIII and XbaI sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was cloned into a pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen). EST clones corresponding to polyketide reductase 5 (PKR5, GenBank accession no. AV424286; synonymous with chalcone reductase, CHR) and 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (HID, GenBank accession no. AV425769) are in the collection of Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The construction of expression vectors, heterologous expression, and in vitro assays of IFS and HID have been described previously.13,27 The PKR activity was tested by assaying 6′-deoxychalcone synthase activity as described previously,28 except that the CHS source was the enzyme solution prepared from recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing a cDNA for CHS obtained from licorice, instead of plant cell-free extracts.2.3. Semi-quantitative RT–PCRTo analyze the expression patterns of each paralogous gene in GSH-treated seedlings and various organs, specific primers were designed (Table 1). mRNA isolation from L. japonicus Gifu B-129 and first-strand cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously.20,22 The absence of contamination with genomic DNA in the cDNA samples was confirmed by PCR with a primer set designed to overlap one of the exon–intron junctions of the isoflavone reductase 1 (IFR1) gene. The quantity of each template was adjusted to give roughly equal amplification of β-tubulin cDNA. RT (reverse transcriptase)–PCR was carried out with 0.5 pmol of each specific primer using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara-Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) in a final volume of 20 µl according to the manufacturer's protocol. The products (5 µl) were separated on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.2.4. Construction of phylogenetic treeNeighbor-joining trees were generated from the results of 1000 bootstrap replicates using the CLUSTAL W program29 of the DNA Data Bank of Japan (Shizuoka, Japan). The phylogenetic trees were displayed by NJplot software.30A CHS phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the coding sequences of CHSs and plant polyketide synthases, i.e. acridone synthase, bibenzyl synthase, and stilbene synthase. GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of polyketide synthases are Antirrhinum majus CHS (X03710), Arabidopsis thaliana CHS (M20308), Camellia sinensis CHS1 (D26593), Cicer arietinum CHS (AJ012690), Daucus carota CHS2 (AJ006780), Gerbera hybrida CHS1 (Z38096), Glycine max CHS2 (X65636), G. max CHS3 (X53958), G. max CHS4 (X52097), G. max CHS5 (L07647), G. max CHS6 (L03352), G. max CHS7 (M98871), G. max CHS8 (AY237728), Malus x domestica CHS1 (DQ026297), Ipomoea purpurea CHSA (U15946), I. purpurea CHSB (U15947), Lycopersicon esculentum CHS1 (X55194), L. esculentum CHS2 (X55195), Medicago sativa CHS1 (L02901), M. sativa CHS2 (L02902), M. sativa CHS4 (L02903), M. sativa CHS8 (L02904), M. sativa CHS9 (L02905), M. sativa CHS12-1 (U01021), Perilla frutescens CHS (AB002815), Petunia x hybrida CHS (AF233638), Phalaenopsis sp. bibenzyl synthase (X79903), Pinus strobus CHS (AJ004800), P. sylvestris bibenzyl synthase (X60753), P. strobus stilbene synthase (Z46914), Pisum sativum CHS2 (X63334), Pueraria lobata CHS (D10223), Ruta graveolens acridone synthase (Z34088), Trifolium subterraneum CHS1 (M91193), T. subterraneum CHS2 (M91194), T. subterraneum CHS3 (L24515), T. subterraneum CHS5 (L24517), T. subterraneum CHS6 (M91195), Vitis stilbene synthase (S63221), and Vitis vinifera CHS (X75969).A phylogenetic tree of PKR cDNAs was constructed based on the 384 bp region from the initiation codon of aldo/keto reductase (AKR) and PKR/CHR, because full-length ORF sequences of EST clones were unavailable. GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences used for the construction of a PKR phylogenetic tree are A. thaliana AKR (NM104687), Fragaria x ananassa AKR (AY703448), G. max PKR (X55730), G. max PKR-like (BG882535), Glycyrrhiza echinata PKR (D83718), Glycyrrhiza glabra PKR2 (D86559), Hydrangea macrophylla AKR (AY382665), M. sativa CHR (X82368), M. truncatula PKR-like (TC100399), Papaver somniferum codeinone reductase (AF108435), P. lobata CHR (AF462632), Oryza sativa AKR (XM462652), and Sesbania rostrata CHR (AJ223291).A phylogenetic tree of the genes for short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) was constructed based on full-length ORFs of IFR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER), pinoresinol–lariciresinol reductase (PLR), and pterocarpan reductase (PTR). GenBank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of these are C. arietinum IFR (X60755), Desmodium uncinatum leucoanthocyanidin reductase (AJ550154), Forsythia x intermedia PLR (U81158), G. max IFR (AJ003245), M. sativa IFR (X58078), M. truncatula IFR (AF277052), Pinus taeda PCBER (AF242490), P. sativum IFR (S72472), Populus trichocarpa PCBER (AJ132262), Tsuga heterophylla PLR1 (AF242501), T. heterophylla PLR2 (AF242502), Thuja plicata PLR1 (AF242503), T. plicata PLR2 (AF242504), T. plicata PLR3 (AF242505), and T. plicata PLR4 (AF242506).3. Results3.1. Assignment of legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid genesThe structural genes involved in vestitol biosynthesis except for CHS genes were found in the genomic clones isolated by PCR-based screening of L. japonicus genome libraries.24 Some of the CHS genes had already been reported,25 and, in the present study, the other paralogous genes were discovered in the genomic sequences obtained in the course of the whole-genome sequencing program of this plant.24 The chromosomal localization and accession numbers of all genes identified are summarized in Table 2. Those that have been functionally characterized before are PKR1, CHI1, CHI3, IFS1, 2,7,4′-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4′-O-methyltransferase (HI4′OMT), isoflavone 2′-hydroxylase (I2′H), and PTR1-PTR4.11–13,20,31 The genes for PKR5, HID, and another IFS (IFS2) were functionally assigned in this study by in vitro assays using the heterologously expressed proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1). The other paralogous genes and putative genes for CHS, IFR, and vestitone reductase (VR) were assigned based on the sequence similarity to those identified from other plants, the resemblance of exon/intron structures, and the phylogenetic relationship of the predicted coding sequences as described in what follows. IFS1, I2′H, and IFR1 correspond to the previously reported cDNAs, LjCYP-1, LjCYP-2, and LjIFR, respectively.20Summary of genes involved in vestitol biosynthesis of L. japonicusn.d., not determined.aEST clones.bPositions of PTR1-3 genes have not been determined due to the high number of repeated sequences in LjT44D07.Summary of genes involved in vestitol biosynthesis of L. japonicusn.d., not determined.aEST clones.bPositions of PTR1-3 genes have not been determined due to the high number of repeated sequences in LjT44D07.3.2. Structures of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genesStructural analysis of putative CHS genes of L. japonicus revealed 13 paralogs, named CHS1–CHS13 (Fig. 2A). Two clusters, composed of three (CHS4, CHS5, and CHS6) and five (CHS7, CHS8, CHS9, CHS10, and CHS11) genes, respectively, are found on chromosome II. CHS9 should be a pseudogene because the initiation codon (ATG) is changed to ATA by a transition. The other five CHS genes, CHS1 to CHS3, CHS12 and CHS13, are separately located on chromosome I, III, and VI, respectively. The structure of the CHS genes is highly conserved: all the CHS genes are composed of two exons, i.e. the first exon (178 bp) and second exon (992 bp), except for CHS1, which has a second exon of 998 bp.Structures of genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 5-deoxyisoflavonids in L. japonicus genome.

The figures show only the structural features and relative lengths of exon (black boxes) and intron (white boxes) sequences of each gene, not distances between the genes.Four PKR genes, PKR1–PKR4, compose a cluster in a 50 kb region of a genomic clone LjT38O12 mapped in the south end of chromosome II in accession Miyakojima MG-20 and chromosome I in accession Gifu B-129 (Fig. 2B), which is known as the reciprocal translocated region.26 They are composed of three exons, and the lengths of the first (323 bp) and second (244 bp) exons are conserved. The first exon of PKR3 contains ca. 5.3 kb sequence in which a terminal-repeat retrotransposon in miniature-like sequence is found, and thus PKR3 should be a pseudogene. The coding sequences of PKR1, PKR2, and PKR4 are more than 90% identical to each other. Two additional PKR genes, PKR5, and PKR6, are found in LjT10F22a, whose chromosome location is unknown. PKR5 and PKR6 are composed of four exons, and the corresponding exons of the two genes are identical in length.The IFS1 gene encoding CYP93C1720 is found in LjT24P23, and IFS2 and IFS3 are located in LjT46B17 (Fig. 2C). The map position of LjT24P23 has not been clarified because no linkage marker was found in LjT24P23.The multiple alignments of the IFS sequences revealed insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms among the IFS genes. Fig. 3 shows the alignments of a partial nucleotide (A) and amino acid (B) sequences of IFS from L. japonicus (IFS1–IFS3) together with two genes for functionally identified IFS, CYP93C2 of Glycyrrhiza echinata18 and CYP93C1v2 of Glycine max.17 The cladistic relationships of the IFS genes were elucidated using the I/D polymorphisms (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the IFS3 of L. japonicus is the most derived. In IFS3, a frame shift is caused by a 4-bp insertion at 1217, and a non-sense codon (TGA) is formed next to His427 (asterisk in Fig. 3B). The heme-binding amino acid residue, which is critical for the activity of cytochrome P450, was predicted to be Cys445 in IFS1 and Cys449 in IFS2, but is lacking in IFS3. IFS3 is thus considered to be a pseudogene. On the other hand, the 3- or 12-base deletions found in IFS1, IFS2, and CYP93C2 at the other sites cause no frameshift, and the amino acid residues encoded by deletion sites are probably unessential.The I/D polymorphisms in IFS genes of L. japonicus (IFS1–IFS3), Glycyrrhiza echinata (Genbank accession no.

The synapomorphic character state is indicated at each internode of (C).HI4′OMT catalyzes the reaction step next to IFS. The HI4′OMT gene is found in the same clone as IFS1 (LjT24P23), although the detailed organization of the genes has not been clarified (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that a cluster contains non-homologous genes encoding different enzymes of sequential reactions in the same pathway. Similar gene organizations and the implications for the evolution of metabolic diversity have also been reported.32,33The genes for HID and I2′H (CYP81E6) are located in LjB01D01 (chromosome location unknown) and LjT07D18 on chromosome IV, respectively (Fig. 2D and E). The deduced amino acid sequence of L. japonicus HID showed 75.1% identity to G. echinata HID and possesses both an oxyanion hole and catalytic triad, which are characteristic structures of the active site in the carboxylesterase family.13 Further inspection of LjB01D01 revealed two carboxylesterase-like genes in the adjacent region. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of these genes is only 52.3% identical to L. japonicus HID, and thus it is not expected that this protein has HID activity. The other one is possibly a pseudogene, because no complete ORF was predicted.DNA gel blot analyses that detected homologous sequences with > 80% identity suggest that L. japonicus has single copies of HI4′OMT and HID (Supplementary Fig. S2) as well as I2′H.20Putative IFR genes (IFR1 and IFR2) are located in a ca. 7 kb region of LjT32H22 mapped on chromosome IV (Fig. 2F). The structures of the two genes are highly similar: all the exons and introns are exactly the same in length, and the nucleotide sequences between the initiation and termination codons, including both exons and introns, are 99.7% identical. On the other hand, the identities of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions are less than 50%. Another IFR-like sequence was found ca. 18 kb distant from IFR2 but is not thought to be IFR because of the low sequence identity (ca. 60%).Two putative VR genes (VR1 and VR2) are within ca. 17 kb in a contig comprised of LjT43J18 and LjB20B09 mapped on chromosome I (Fig. 2G). Another VR-like gene (VR3) is at ca. 10 kb from VR2, but it is judged to be a pseudogene because it lacks an initiation codon.Four genes are shown to encode PTR.12 Three of these, PTR1–PTR3, are located within a 15 kb region in LjT44D07 on chromosome III, and a reductase-like gene is also found in the same clone (Fig. 2H). Because of the high number of repeated sequences in LjT44D07, the nucleotide sequence of the clone has been deposited in the database as a draft sequence. The positions of PTR1, PTR2, and PTR3 genes described in Table 2 are based on the draft sequence. PTR4 gene is located in LjT37D14 on chromosome I. The PTR1–PTR3 genes are composed of five exons, but PTR4 has four. Their exon lengths are not conserved (Fig. 2H). The identities of the deduced amino acid sequences of the four PTRs are 60–67%.3.3. Phylogenetic analysesCHS and PKR are members of plant polyketide synthase and aldo/keto reductase superfamilies, respectively. IFR and PTR are in the SDR family, which includes two enzymes of the lignan pathway, PCBER and PLR. The phylogenetic relationships of the orthologous and paralogous genes related to CHS, PKR, IFR, and PTR were investigated based on the coding sequences (Fig. 4).Phylogenetic trees of CHSs (A), PKRs (B), and the SDR family including IFRs and PTRs (C), constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The bootstrap replicates were 1000 (values over 500 are given at the nodes). Phalaenopsis sp. bibenzyl synthase, P. stipitis xylose reductase, and D. uncinatum leucoanthocyanidin reductase were used as an outgroup to root the trees of CHSs, PKRs, and the SDR family, respectively.Phylogenetic trees of CHSs (A), PKRs (B), and the SDR family including IFRs and PTRs (C), constructed by the neighbor-joining method.

Phalaenopsis sp. bibenzyl synthase, P. stipitis xylose reductase, and D. uncinatum leucoanthocyanidin reductase were used as an outgroup to root the trees of CHSs, PKRs, and the SDR family, respectively.Most of the established and putative CHS genes of L. japonicus and other leguminous CHS genes constituted a monophyletic group (Fig. 4A). The topology of the legume-specific clade was consistent with the phylogeny of Papilionoideae.34 It is thus likely that the duplication processes that generated the paralogous CHS genes in L. japonicus occurred after the divergence of the legume clades. The phylogenetic tree also suggests the existence of a non-leguminous type of CHS, CHS1, of L. japonicus (Fig. 4A), but the origin and actual catalytic function of the CHS1 protein are unknown.The PKR genes of legumes fell into two subclades (Fig. 4B). PKR1, PKR2, and PKR4 of L. japonicus were grouped with PKR/CHR genes of other legumes previously identified, whereas PKR5 and PKR6 were in another branch with several genes of G. max and M. truncatula annotated as ‘CHR-like’. Because PKR5 showed catalytic activity, as described earlier, it is possible that other CHR-like genes in this clade may encode active PKR. In the evolutionary processes, the ancestral PKR was possibly duplicated once before the speciation of Papilionoideae, and the subsequent duplication caused the paralogous genes in the two subclades.A recent study showed that four reductases of L. japonicus, which are significantly similar to IFR, PCBER, and PLR, have PTR activity.12 The phylogenetic tree of these reductases showed that the PTR genes of L. japonicus (PTR1–PTR4) constitute a monophyletic clade with the PCBER of Populus trichocarpa (Fig. 4C). The putative IFRs of L. japonicus were likely to encode active IFR proteins because they were positioned in a monophyletic clade with other functionally characterized IFR genes. Both PCBER and PLR are involved in lignan biosynthesis, but the PTR/PCBER clade is closer to the IFR clade than the PLR clade. No orthologous gene similar to PCBER or PLR has so far been found in L. japonicus.3.4. Expression of vestitol biosynthesis genesWe previously showed that treatment of L. japonicus seedlings with GSH induced the production of vestitol and the accumulation of transcripts from type II CHIs, CHI1 and CHI3, and I2′H genes.20,21 To examine the expression of each paralogous gene in GSH-treated seedlings comprehensively, semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis was performed. Among the 17 genes examined, the transcripts of 11 genes, i.e. PKR1, PKR2, PKR6, IFS1, IFS2, HI4′OMT, HID, IFR1, IFR2, VR2 and PTR3, were markedly elevated 10 h after GSH treatment (Fig. 5A). A slight increase of PKR4 and VR1 transcripts during 10 h of elicitation and their decrease in 20 h after GSH treatment were also obvious. In contrast, those of PKR5, PTR1, PTR2, and PTR4 were constitutively expressed and not substantially affected by GSH.Accumulation of transcripts encoded by the vestitol biosynthetic genes in L. japonicus. mRNA was isolated from 4-day-old seedlings at 10 and 20 h after the GSH treatment or at 10 h after H2O treatment (A) or from flowers (F), stems (S), leaves (L), roots (R), and nodules (N) of 8-week-old L. japonicus plant (B). Amplification of β-tubulin served as a control to adjust the amount of PCR template DNA.Accumulation of transcripts encoded by the vestitol biosynthetic genes in L. japonicus. mRNA was isolated from 4-day-old seedlings at 10 and 20 h after the GSH treatment or at 10 h after H2O treatment (A) or from flowers (F), stems (S), leaves (L), roots (R), and nodules (N) of 8-week-old L. japonicus plant (B). Amplification of β-tubulin served as a control to adjust the amount of PCR template DNA.The RT–PCR analysis also showed that transcripts of the genes were detectable in almost all tissues investigated. The expression patterns were rather complex, but some genes clearly showed organ specificity (Fig. 5B). Characteristically, no transcripts of any PKR paralogs, HID, I2′H, IFR1, VR2, and PTR2 genes in flowers were observed, and neither the transcripts of PTR paralogs in nodules. The PKR transcripts were accumulated in both aerial (stems and leaves) and underground (roots and nodules) parts, but the expression level of PKR paralogs was higher in underground parts. In contrast, the expression of all PTR genes was mainly observed in aerial parts, and only the PTR4 transcript was detected in roots. Also, the expression of some paralogous genes was different among the organs: e.g. IFS1 was expressed in all organs, whereas IFS2 was highly expressed in leaves and weakly in underground parts; and the expression of VR1 was ubiquitous in all tissues investigated, but expression of VR2 was limited to leaves, roots, and stems. On the other hand, the expression patterns of paralogous genes, such as CHI1 and CHI3 and PKR1 and PKR2, were almost the same, suggesting their functional redundancy.4. DiscussionStructural analysis of the genes involved in the legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid biosynthesis of L. japonicus revealed that six genes of the 10 investigated compose multigene families and form gene clusters in many cases. The origin of multigene families is attributed to gene duplication. The paralogous genes of L. japonicus involved in the flavonoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis were suggested to have acquired new functions different from the ancestral types as the result of accumulated nucleotide substitutions during their molecular evolution.21–23 The gene cluster of HID and carboxylesterase-like genes (Fig. 2D) also implies the evolution of HID through local gene duplication of an ancestral carboxylesterase-like gene. These findings support the idea that gene duplication is a major driving force for the evolution of novel metabolic pathways.35–37 Considering that enzymes with new functions might have been established through such evolutionary processes, we expected that candidates for enzymes and genes could be narrowed down by the combination of the predicted reaction mode of the target enzyme and the phylogenetic relationship. Actually, the genes for PTR were found in the SDR family, which includes PCBER, IFR, and PLR.12 The phylogenetic tree implies that PTR genes should have been derived from the ancestral PCBER genes (Fig. 4C).We present a comprehensive expression analysis of the genes involved in 5-deoxyisoflavonoid biosynthesis. Together with the previous finding on the GSH-induced transcription of type II CHI and I2′H genes,20,21 all single genes and most of the paralogous genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes as far as identified were shown to be synchronously up-regulated by the GSH treatment (Fig. 5A), which has been thought to mimic the signal of defense response, guaranteeing the elicitor responsive synthesis of vestitol. The coordinate increase of the transcripts suggests a common set of transcription factors involved in the regulation of this pathway, and the GSH-treatment will serve as a potential experimental system to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the 5-deoxyisoflavonoid genes. Although no significant cis elements common to the GSH-dependent genes has been predicted by in silico analysis, they will be obtained by further experiments of promoter analysis and used to identify the corresponding transcription factors. An interesting observation is the constitutive expression of PTR paralogs, except for PTR3, which was apparently up-regulated on GSH treatment. The role of PTR3 in vestitol biosynthesis has been considered to be insignificant, because it possesses low specific activity and no enantiospecificity.12 If the final step of vestitol synthesis is performed by enantiospecific PTR1 and PTR2 with high specific activity, this step is out of the regulation asserted by elicitor and not a rate-limiting step of phytoalexin biosynthesis.The semiquantitative RT–PCR analyses also revealed the organ specific expression of each paralogous gene (Fig. 5B). Weak or no expression of PTR paralogs and the high expression levels of the other up-stream genes in underground parts imply that 5-deoxyisoflavonoids may be produced in symbiotic roots and nodules. Functions of flavonoids as positive and negative regulators in nodule development have been discussed.38 The observation that transcripts of some genes, i.e. PKR paralogs and HID, were not detected in flowers may conform the notion that the normal L. japonicus flower tissue producing flavonols and anthocyanins does not synthesize 5-deoxyisoflavonoids. However, the expression of genes may not simply reflect the flavonoid compositions, and more detailed and comprehensive examination of the transcripts and metabolites of the 5-deoxyisoflavonid pathway in specific tissues and cells and during nodule organogenesis would be expected in the future.On the other hand, the nearly identical expression patterns of some paralogous genes, such as PKR1 and PKR2, and CHIs (Fig. 5B), strongly suggested that these paralogous genes are functionally redundant. They are likely to have been maintained during the legume evolution under selection pressure. A previously presented genetic model on the molecular evolution of genes showed that genetic redundancy is common in some cases, contrary to the widespread view that a redundant gene would be abolished by accumulated deleterious mutations.39 According to the model, redundant genes can be stable, provided they have pleiotropic functions or they are expressed in specific spatiotemporal patterns. Our expression analysis showed that some duplicated genes, e.g. PKR4, IFS2, VR2, PTR3, and PTR4, have acquired different expression patterns (Fig. 5A and B). IFS paralogs of soybean were also reported to show different expression patterns in different tissues, and in response to nodulation and defense signal. Alternatively, one of the two completely redundant genes will become extinct, but it may take a long time, provided that the mutation rates of the two genes are not very different.39The fact that the legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid pathway is at present widely distributed among Papilionoideae strongly suggests its substantial contributions to the fitness of leguminous plants, that is, 5-deoxyisoflavonoids have significant ecological and physiological functions. The roles of the individual biosynthetic genes will be clarified in part by dissection of the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and the distribution of 5-deoxyisoflavonoids, namely, by transcriptomics and metabolomics. In general, these ‘-omics’ approaches are profoundly dependent on gene annotations. The results of this study provide the correct annotations for the legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid genes. On the other hand, reverse genetic approaches such as RNA interference or TILLING will enable us to test the significance of a gene, a biosynthetic step, or a pathway. RNA interference is applicable to redundant genes if the consensus sequences common to all the paralogous genes are known;40,41 single genes, e.g. HI4′OMT, HID, and I2′H of L. japonicus, can be the targets for knocking out by TILLING. The present study will also offer useful information for these functional genomic studies of leguminous plants.This work was supported by the 21st Century COE program ‘Bioresource Utilization Based on Microbial Symbiotic Systems’ of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and the project ‘Development of Fundamental Technologies for Controlling the Material Production Process of Plants’ of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization.

IntroductionMicrosatellites (MSs), or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are short consecutive repetitive DNA sequence motifs with 1–6 bp in length. The frequency and distribution of MSs have been studied in detail in genomes of bacteria,1 animals,2 and plants.3 MSs have become a valuable source of molecular markers, widely used in genetic diversity analysis4 and positional cloning in rice5,6 because of their ubiquity and polymorphism.7Starting with screening genomic DNA libraries with MS probes,8,9 many investigators have been involved in generating new MS markers10–12 and integrating them into the rice genetic map.13 However, the desire to have more markers is still strong, since the amount and their density over rice genomes are not sufficient for satisfying the need of geneticists and breeders.It is fortunate that Beijing Genomics Institute14 (BGI) and the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project15 have released their rice genomic data that provide comparative basis for a thorough analysis on MS between indica and japonica subspecies. Although such a survey has been done recently for chromosome 4 without eliminating MSs with multiple copies,16 the report focused on MSs in japonica rice cv. Nipponbare, mainly composed of DNRs, TNRs, and TTRs. In this study, we emphasize our newly discovered MS makers through a comparative analysis on MSs between the indica and japonica genome sequences, and have developed a genome-wide MS polymorphism database that have markers indexed in both rice genomes to facilitate molecular studies and marker-assisted breeding practice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Rice genome sequences and MS screeningThe genome sequences for indica (Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. 9311) and japonica (O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) (Version build4) were downloaded from http://rise.genomics.org.cn/rice2/index.jsp17 and http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp15 respectively. The 5′-UTR, coding, intronic, 3′-UTR, and intergenic regions were determined based on their original annotations. An MS motif scanning tool, SSRIT11 written in Perl was downloaded from Cornell University (http://www.gramene.org/) and modified to search for perfect MS repeats in the two rice genome sequences, including mono-nucleotide repeats (MNRs), di-nucleotide repeats (DNRs), tri-nucleotide repeats (TNRs), tetra-nucleotide repeats (TTRs), penta-nucleotide repeats (PNRs), and hexa-nucleotide repeats (HNRs) with numbers of repeat units of 10, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 4, respectively. Some of these MS sequences were combined into one repeat complex if the lengths between two adjacent units were less than 20 bp.2.2. MS Polymorphism and primer designAn MS locus is defined as a tract of genomic sequences that include a perfect repeat motif and two unique 160-bp flanking sequences on each sides of the repeat. These MS candidate sequences were aligned to their source genome sequences with BLASTN (E-value cutoff of 1e-40); those with unique hit were selected as candidate MS loci together with their specific flanking sequences. The selected MS sequences were then used as queries against another genome without filtering low complexity sequences. We wrote a Perl script (Supplementary script: polymorphism.pl) to determine the presence of polymorphisms among MS motifs between indica and japonica. Primers pairs were automatically designed on the basis of unique flanking sequences aided by Primer318 with its default parameters. Candidate primer sequences were subsequently filtered through following parameters: length range from 18 to 24 bp, devoid of consecutive tracts of single nucleotide, GC content around 50% with a theoretical Tm approximately 60°C, and perfect ending with G- or C-rich at the 3′ end.2.3. Experimental validationOne hundred primer pairs covering all rice chromosomes and covering all MS types were used for our validation experiment. The DNA templates used in this experiment are O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 9311 and O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare grown in a green house. Genomic DNA was extracted from 1-week-old seedlings, using the CTAB method.19 The quality of DNA was evaluated electrophoretically with 0.8% agarose gel.Oligonucleotide primers were made by Shanghai DNA Biotechnologies Co., Ltd. PCR was performed in 25 µl reactions containing 3.0 µl buffer, 2.5 µl MgCl2 (25 mM), 2.0 µl dNTP (2.5 mM), 0.5 µl Taq polymerase (5 U/µl), 3.0 µl template DNA (10 ng/µl), 13 µl ddH2O, 0.1 µg primers. A PTC-100TM thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc. Incline Village, NV, USA) was used along with the following PCR profile settings: 2 min at 96°C, 35 cycles of 40 s at 95°C, 30 s at 61°C, 1 min 30 s at 72°C, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Montage TM PCR96 Cleanup Kits were used to purify PCR products before being sequenced with an ABI 377 DNA sequencer.3. Results and discussion3.1. MS identification and distribution in the indica and japonica genomesWe identified 102 706 and 102 423 candidate MSs in the indica and japonica genomes, respectively, and the average distances between the repeat units are shorter in the indica genome (3.6 kb) than in the japonica (3.7 kb) genome. These candidate MSs reside largely within intergenic regions (58 094 or 56.6% for the indica and 58 812 or 57.4% for the japonica), as compared to those in intronic regions (20 868 or 20.3% in the indica and 19 631 or 19.2% for the japonica) (Table 1). However, the average MS lengths in the indica and japonica genomes were found similar, from 17.4 bp to 17.8 bp. The fractions of MSs with unique flanking sequences in the indica and japonica are 67.1% and 72.5%, respectively. We also found that one-third of the total MSs are polymorphic and that the number of MS with unique flanking sequences was slightly lower in the indica (68 895) than in the japonica (74 227), but the number of MS sequences with polymorphisms and their average lengths were nearly the same between the two subspecies (Table 1). It implies that the number of MS with polymorphisms and the average length of polymorphic SSRs are independent parameters in the two rice subspecies. MS loci most likely to be useful as genetic markers are those that are single copy in both genomes and polymorphic when the genomes are compared.Frequency and polymorphism of MSs in different genomic regions of indica and japonica genomesaAll MSs in the genomes.bMSs with unique flanking sequences.cMSs with polymorphisms.dRate of MS Wpm in MS Wsfs.eAverage length of MSs expressed in base pairs (bp).fPercent of MSs with unique flanking sequences against all.gPercent of MSs with polymorphisms against all.Frequency and polymorphism of MSs in different genomic regions of indica and japonica genomesaAll MSs in the genomes.bMSs with unique flanking sequences.cMSs with polymorphisms.dRate of MS Wpm in MS Wsfs.eAverage length of MSs expressed in base pairs (bp).fPercent of MSs with unique flanking sequences against all.gPercent of MSs with polymorphisms against all.3.2. MS polymorphisms in different genomic regionsWe have noticed that the average MS length and distance between candidate MS loci within coding regions of the two subspecies were slightly different. The indica genome has an average MS length of 20.8 bp and an average distance between candidate MS loci of 8.1 kb; the corresponding numbers in the japonica genome are 20.6 bp and 7.7 kb, respectively. In the regions other than the coding sequences, the average MS length and the average distance between candidate MS loci become 2.1–3.9 bp and 2.0–4.0 kb, respectively, although MS sequences are most abundant in 5′-UTR, followed in an order of intronic, 3′-UTR, intergenic, and coding regions. The trend was found consistent with previous reports in Arabidopsis and rice.3,20,21 In addition, GC contents of MS in other regions (19.9–40.1 and 20.8–42.0) are far lower than that of coding regions that are 81.4% and 81.4 % for the indica and japonica, respectively.We also looked into details of MSs and their unique flanking sequences among different regions in the indica genome and found that there are higher numbers of MSs with unique flanking sequences in intergenic, intronic, and 5′-UTR regions, and the trend is similar in japonica. MSs with both polymorphism and unique flanking sequences vary in different genomic regions, there are as low as 21.5 and 22% in coding regions in the indica and japonica genomes, respectively, whereas there is up to 40% observed in the intronic region (Table 1). We concluded that MSs within intronic regions are most polymorphic, and followed by UTR, intergenic, and coding regions.3.3. Polymorphisms and distribution of different MS repeat typesIn our collection, there are 62.5% MNRs, 17.2% DNRs, and 10.6% TNRs, which form the rice genome sequences; these repeat types are collectively over 90% of the total MS sequences. The distributions of these MS types are rather similar between indica and japonica in general. TNRs were predominately found in coding regions (87.5% for indica and 87.6% for japonica, respectively). MNRs and DNRs are highly dispersed in intronic, 3′-UTR, intergenic, and 5′-UTR regions (Fig. 1A). The distribution of polymorphic MS loci is similar among all types, except the percentage of TNRs in various genomic regions varies significantly (Fig. 1B). With respect to the polymorphism rate (the ratio between MSs with polymorphism and the total) and those with unique flanking sequences, we found that MNRs and DNRs are better than TNRs in all genomic regions (Fig. 1C). The polymorphism rate of TTRs, PNRs, and HNRs varies from 32 to 40% (data not shown), and they may provide additional sources for molecular makers when called upon.Percentages and polymorphic rates of MNR, DNR, and TNR in different regions of the two rice genomes.

(B) Percentages of MNR, DNR, and TNR with polymorphisms. (C) Polymorphic rates of MNR, DNR, and TNR.3.4. Polymorphisms of the candidate MS loci with different repeat unitsThe number of A/T repeats is 8.5 and 6.8 times of all repeat types in the indica and japonica genomes, respectively; it is 7.5 and 6.6 times more polymorphic than C/G repeats. The average MS length (13.8 bp in the indica and 13.6 bp in the japonica) and the average length of MSs with polymorphisms (14.4 bp in indica and 14.1 bp in japonica) in C/G repeats are slightly longer than those of A/T repeats (10.8–11.2 bp). The polymorphism rate of C/G MNR class of SSR is slightly higher (68.6% for indica and 61.3% for japonica) than that of A/T MNRs (53.5% for indica and 49.6% for japonica). Therefore, when targeting MNRs as the basis for developing genetic markers, the C/G repeat class is likely to be more useful, at least when comparing indica and japonica genotypes. Among DNRs, both AG/CT (59.8–56.4%) and AT/TA (>50%) repeats are more polymorphic than CG/GC repeats (15.6%). AT/TA repeats in the indica and japonica assemblies have a longer average length (>30 bp) than AG/CT repeats (22.6–22.5 bp; Table 2). The polymorphism rate of GC-rich TNRs is relatively lower than that of GC-poor TNRs, despite the fact that CCG/CGG repeats are the most abundant, contributing more than 40% to the total TNRs. The GC-poor repeats, such as AAT/ATT, AAG/CTT, and ACT/AGT, have polymorphic rates greater than 40% (Table 2). Another example is AGG/CCT that contributes to 15% of the total TNRs but the polymorphic rate of AGG/CCT repeats is relatively low, 35.5% for indica and 31.7% for japonica. The numbers of polymorphic ATC/GCT, AAC/GTT, and ACT/AGT repeats are scarce. Among TTRs, AGAT/ATCT, AAAT/ATTT, AAAG/CTTT, ACAT/ATGT, AGCT/AGCT, and AATT/AATT are quite dominant, and the two kinds of TTR (ACAT/ATGT and AGAT/ATCT) have longer average lengths and higher polymorphism rates. Among PNRs, AAAAG/CTTTT, AAAAT/ATTTT, AGAGG/CCTCT, and AGGGG/CCCCT are rather dominant, AGAGG/CCTCT is more polymorphic, 24.8% in indica and 31.7% in japonica; all other kinds of PNR have much lower polymorphic rates (data not shown).Polymorphism distribution of MS motifs in indica and japonica genomesLabels are the same as in Table 1.Polymorphism distribution of MS motifs in indica and japonica genomesLabels are the same as in Table 1.We detected 35 691 polymorphic MS loci with unique flanking sequences in the indica genome and 35 779 in the japonica genome (Table 3). If we took away 18 016 loci common for both, there were 53 454 subspecific MS loci left, and we were able to design primer pairs for 52 845 MSs (Table 3), which gave rise to one polymorphic MS for every 7.1 and 7.2 kb in lengths in indica and japonica, respectively. Of these MSs, there were 36 374 MNRs, 8298 DNRs, 3878 TNRs, 802 TTRs, 683 PNRs, 487 HNRs, and 2323 complex repeats that comprised two or more repeat units (Table 3). We also analyzed the length polymorphism of MSs in indica and japonica sequences (Fig. 2), and found that approximately 38% of MSs have a length difference of 1 bp. Only about 8% of MSs have a length polymorphism of more than 10 bp, and the number of MSs with polymorphism length of 5 and 7 bp is relatively small (Fig. 2), since the length polymorphism is related to the length of the repeat units or types.Length distribution of polymorphic MSs in indica and japonica rice genomes.Length distribution of polymorphic MSs in indica and japonica rice genomes.Summary of polymorphic MS loci(1) The identified polymorphic MS loci in indica; (2) The identified polymorphic MS loci in japonica; (3) The common polymorphic MS loci that are found to be the same in both indica and japonica; (4) The theoretical estimates of all polymorphic MS loci in rice that can be estimated according to the following formula polymorphic MS = (1) + (2) − (3); (5) Observed values of all polymorphic MS loci in rice.

Development of the polymorphic MS database for rice subspeciesA total of 18 828 SSR markers have been recently reported based on sequence analysis of the japonica cv. Nipponbare genome,15 and 2240 of the total were experimentally confirmed.13 Since some of the markers between the two genomes may not be polymorphic and their physical positions may not be unique, we may not be able to include all of them in our database. Although some MS polymorphisms in chromosome 4 between the indica and japonica have been reported,16 it was limited to a single chromosome without eliminating multiple-hitting copies. In addition, previous works have mainly focused on Class I MSs, such as DNRs, TNRs, and TTRs, whereas Class II MSs, including MNRs, PNRs, and HNRs have not drawn enough attention for marker development.By comparing MS sequences between the sequenced indica and japonica genomes, we developed a new database for 52 845 (Table 3) polymorphic MS loci with specific flanking sequences, including polymorphic ample Class II MSs. To avoid confusion in MS naming convention used by the rice community, we integrated 18 828 MSs published by IRGSP15 into our collection, and the same loci are cross-referenced (6294 MSs from IRGSP). However, 6641 MSs were excluded because they have multiple copies in the rice genome. Some 3988 MSs were found lack of polymorphism between the indica and japonica genomes, and 1905 MSs were not mapped due to the absence of reciprocal polymorphic sequences between the two genomes. Only 4509 Class I polymorphic MS loci were detected in the indica genome (Table 4), 1775 (6284 − 4509) loci were missed because the length of their repeat motif was less than 20 bp and do not satisfy the criteria of Class I in indica, although they were Class I loci in japonica. These 1775 shorter MS alleles in indica may not represent any technical or biological anomalies but simply happened by chance since MSs are in general short in length. In addition, we also mapped the genetic markers consisting of mostly RFLPs from RGP (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp) on the indica (from http://rise.genomics.org.cn), IRGSP, and TIGR pseudomolecules in silico. Although there is a misunderstanding about the BGI's sequence assemblies, the indica pseudomolecules are believed as useful as the BAC-to-BAC assembly when evaluated carefully according to scientific rationales.22Comparative analysis of MSs identified in indica with different cutoffsClass I: MNRs with 20, DNRs with 10, and TNRs with seven repeat units; Class II: MNRs with 10 repeat units, DNRs with seven, and TNRs with six repeat units. The rest of the labels are the same as in Table 1.Comparative analysis of MSs identified in indica with different cutoffsClass I: MNRs with 20, DNRs with 10, and TNRs with seven repeat units; Class II: MNRs with 10 repeat units, DNRs with seven, and TNRs with six repeat units. The rest of the labels are the same as in Table 1.3.6. Classes of complex MS, such as MNRs, PNRs, and HNRs, could be used as genetic markers in the futureAt present, only some of the MSs, such as DNRs, TNRs, and TTRs, are used as genetic markers for rice, and other types have been largely ignored, perhaps due to the lack of adequate experimental methods, such as in the case of MNRs, although they are accounted for more than 60% of all MSs and approximately half of them are believed polymorphic. In this report, we validated a few MNRs (such as P005 and P010 in Fig. 3), proving their usefulness, and a recent report in typing method23 also suggested a new opportunity for the MNR application as genetic markers for rice. Although PNRs and HNRs have been previously used as molecular markers in sorghum and cotton,24,25 they have not been developed for rice. We found many polymorphic PNRs and HNRs with polymorphisms in the rice genome, and verified some of them experimentally, including eight PNRs, five HNRs, and four complex MSs. We believe that they should be used as genetic markers in rice in the future. It is important to note that polymorphisms found between 9311 and Nipponbare may not be generalized to other indica and japonica genomes, and additional sequence and genotyping information from diverse cultivars will broaden our understanding of SSR polymorphism in O. sativa.Experimental validation (PCR) of polymorphic MSs. Left lanes show PCR products from indica cv. 9311, and right lanes are samples from japonica cv. Nipponbare. MS involved MNR (P005, P010), DNR (P041, P031, P050, P043, P009, P039, P026, P040, P025, P024, P027), TNR (P055, P058, P062), TTR (P077), and other complex MS (P008, P095, P097, P100). Four PCR products for 9311 (P025, P026, P058, P062) and two for Nipponbare (P025, P058) showed complex band patterns and seven products (P008, P010, P025, P050, P055, P058, P062) appeared polymorphic.Experimental validation (PCR) of polymorphic MSs.

MS polymorphisms have two basic parameters, types of the repeat units and numbers of units. By adjusting cut-off values for the number of repeat units toward a lower boundary, we discovered more polymorphic MS loci that are both highly polymorphic and can be uniquely identified in the genomes. We did try to define Class 1 MS by using a standard protocol, but only detected 417 MNRs, 2747 DNRs, and 1345 TNRs in the indica genome assembly. In this report, we found that when the MNR length reaches 10 bp, the polymorphism numbers increases up to 23 324 for MNR with a length of 10 bp, 3825 for DNR with a length of 7 bp, and 2638 for TNR with a length of 6 bp (Table 3). It was evident that polymorphism counts of most Class II MNRs, DNRs, and TNRs are far higher than those of many Class I MS; the result suggests that different numbers of repeat units should be used for screening different MS types as genetic markers, such as 10 for MNRs, 7 for DNRs, 7 for TNRs, 6 for TTRs, 5 for PNRs, and 5 for HNRs.Most MS repeats have unique flanking sequences (62.1% for indica and 73.1% for japonica in our study), and MSs may be preferentially associated with non-repetitive regions in rice genome as reported by Morgante et al.3 except for AT/TA and AAT/ATT repeats.3,10,11 Furthermore, the fraction of MSs with unique flanking sequences in the indica is about 10% lower than that in the japonica, suggesting that there may be more repetitive sequences assembled in the indica genome when compared with the japonica genome. It was reported previously that MS polymorphism is positively correlated with their length,4,12 and the distribution of GC-rich DNRs and TNRs have a bias toward exons where polymorphisms occur scarcely.3,11,17,21 We also found in our current study that the degree of the polymorphisms in MSs depends on their genomic locations and the repeat types. For instance, higher polymorphism rates were found within intronic and UTR regions, whereas the lowest within coding regions. The relationship between GC content and MS polymorphism is unclear. For instance, A/T-containing MNRs have a slightly lower polymorphism rate than the G/C containing repeats. The opposite seems true in DNRs, where AG/CG repeats have higher polymorphism rates of 52–60%, than those in CG/GC repeats (15–16%). Similarly, CCG/CGG repeats contributing almost half of the total TNRs have a polymorphism rate of less than 30%, whereas AAT/ATT AAG/CTT and ACT/AGT have polymorphism rates of greater than 40%. Our results are in agreement to previous observations.4,12 The suggested reason was that GC-rich regions are relatively stable and resulted in less replication slippage.263.7. Experimental validation of 100 polymorphic MS lociTo validate our results, we chose 100 polymorphic MSs randomly for validation, using genomic DNA from indica cv. 9311 and japonica cv. Nipponbare as PCR templates. The PCR products were sequenced, and the result is summarized in Table 5 (other detailed information was summarized in Supplementary Table 1). We have 98 polymorphic MSs PCR-amplified in the two cultivars, and four of them worked for 9311 (P025, P026, P058, and P062 in Fig. 3) and two for Nipponbare (P025 and P058), showing complex banding patterns that were perhaps due to lack of sequence specificity in the genomic DNA sample. Sequencing results confirmed 91 PCR products to be polymorphic, and seven (P008, P010, P025, P050, P055, P058, and P062) of the remaining PCR products that failed in sequencing appeared polymorphic based on the existence of multiple DNA bands on agarose gels. Only one (P055) showed unexpected products with a length less than 150 bp. In addition, the sequences amplified with six primer pairs (P060, P016, P037, P087, P020, and P030 in Supplementary Table 1) appeared inconsistent with the expected genomic sequences. This could be explained by the fact that the low-complexity sequences were difficult to be sequenced and relatively error-prone. We concluded that our new MS collection contains at least 90% valid polymorphic MS markers.Summary of PCR amplification and sequencing in indica and japonica genomesNumbers in parentheses are the number of products with complex band pattern.Summary of PCR amplification and sequencing in indica and japonica genomesNumbers in parentheses are the number of products with complex band pattern.This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30571146), the Key Research Project of Zhejiang Province (No. 2003C22007), and Rice Project of Zhejiang Province (04-06).Supplementary data"

IntroductionRecently, expressed sequence tag (EST) analyses have been carried out in various organisms, including fungi,1–5 because this method involves essentially random sequencing of cDNA libraries and can be performed more easily than whole-genome sequencing. EST analysis will enable us to collect nucleotide sequence information of protein-coding regions rapidly and efficiently, and will be helpful for gene finding in genomes. It will also provide gene expression information for a particular type of cultivation or a particular growth phase. For these reasons, EST analysis is conducted as part of many genome projects.The koji mold Aspergillus oryzae, which is a safe filamentous fungus,6,7 produces and secretes various enzymes into the medium. Consequently, it has long been used in industry, particularly in the manufacture of traditional Japanese fermented foods, such as sake, shoyu (soy sauce), and miso (bean paste), as well as commercially valuable enzyme production. High levels of enzyme productivity, the primary reasons for the industrial use of A. oryzae, are achieved through its cultivation on suitable cereals in solid-state culture (SC), not in culture in liquid medium, liquid culture (LC), or agar plate culture. Hence, SC is a major means of industrial cultivation of A. oryzae.8 To understand the superiority of SC, a number of genes transcribed specifically during SC have been identified.9,10 However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the expression of the SC-specific characteristics of A. oryzae remain poorly understood. Secreted enzymes and the genes encoding them have been the major targets of molecular biological analysis of A. oryzae, and investigated actively because of their essential involvement in utilization process of A. oryzae,11,12 whereas there have been few studies of the intracellular physiology at the molecular level. Such studies are necessary for further advanced industrial utilization of A. oryzae, and to understand the behavior of A. oryzae during LC under various conditions because of critical importance of the LC method in modern bioindustries.However, there are several technical difficulties in experimental systems for genetic studies. For example, teleomorphs are not observed through its life cycle, which makes genetic analysis by mating impossible. Vegetative cells and most conidia consistently contain multiple nuclei, and hence isolation of recessive mutants is problematic. However, recombinant DNA techniques for A. oryzae have already been developed, although the efficiency of gene targeting by homologous recombination is poor.11,13Reverse-genetic and/or post-genomic approaches based on nucleotide sequence information are therefore vital for such investigations. However, the availability of sequence information needed for such approaches remains insufficient. Therefore, we performed large-scale EST analysis in A. oryzae, employing nine different cDNA libraries to obtain numerous independent sequences as efficiently as possible. In fact, large number of ESTs were obtained, and they worked as invaluable informational and material bases for subsequent studies; rough gene expression profiling from frequency information, reverse genetics, and DNA micro array preparation. Furthermore, the EST information substantially contributed for predicting ORFs in the A. oryzae whole-genome analysis.142. Materials and methods2.1. Strain, medium, and cultivationThe wild-type A. oryzae strain RIB40 was used as the EST source.Mycelia from nine different cultures were used for cDNA library construction. Culture was performed as follows:LR library (liquid nutrient-rich culture): Culture was carried out in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 0.04% adenine sulfate, 2% glucose) at 30°C for 22 h. Vigorously growing mycelia were harvested.LH library (liquid nutrient-rich culture at higher temperature): Culture was carried out in YPD medium at 37°C for 24 h. Vigorously growing mycelia were harvested.LM library (liquid maltose-inductive culture): Preculture was performed in ACM medium (2% malt extract, 0.1% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) at 37°C for 24 h. Subsequently, mycelia were washed with and transferred into maltose-inductive medium (1% Bacto-peptone, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.1% NaNO3, 0.05% MgSO4•7H2O), then incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Transcription in harvested mycelia would be affected by maltose induction.LS library (liquid carbon-starved culture): Preculture was performed in YPD medium at 30°C for 22 h. Subsequently, mycelia were washed with water and transferred into carbon-lacking CD medium (0.2% NaNO3, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4•7H2O, 0.001% FeSO4), and then incubated at 30°C for 8 h. Carbon-starved mycelia were harvested.LG library (liquid germinated conidia and conidia): A suspension of matured conidia was inoculated into SP medium (3.5% soluble starch, 2% Bacto-peptone, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.5% MgSO4•7H2O). After incubation at 30°C for 12 h, germinated conidia were harvested and mixed with non-precultured conidia, then used for RNA preparation.The cultures described in (i)–(v) were performed in liquid media with rotary shaking.PA library (alkaline pH culture on agar plates): Culture was performed on a cellophane sheet covering alkaline CD agar plate medium (0.2% NaNO3, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4•7H2O, 0.001% FeSO4, 1% glucose, 2% agar, adjusted to pH 10) at 30°C for 3 days. Mycelia adapted to alkaline conditions were harvested.SW library (solid-state wheat bran culture): A conidial suspension was inoculated onto autoclaved wheat bran, and incubated at 30°C for 28 h. Vigorously growing mycelia that were differentiating into submerged hyphae and aerial hyphae were harvested.SS library (solid-state soybean culture): Water-absorbed defatted soybeans were mixed with roasted and crushed wheat. They were autoclaved and inoculated with conidial suspension. Then, they were incubated at 30°C for 34 h, and subsequently at 25°C for 3 h. Mycelia that were developing asexually were harvested.SR library (solid-state rice culture): Polished rice retaining the inner 70% of the whole and α-preprocessed was autoclaved. The conidial suspension was inoculated onto the rice, and then incubated at 37°C for 28 h. Mycelia that were growing vigorously and differentiating into submerged hyphae and aerial hyphae were harvested.2.2. Construction of cDNA librariesTotal RNA was prepared from mycelia growing under various culture conditions as described in Section 2.1. From the LC (including PA), i.e. 2.1(i)−2.1(vi), total RNA was prepared with Isogen (Nippon Gene Co. Ltd), TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corp.), or an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. From the SC, i.e. 2.1(vii)−2.1(ix), total RNA was prepared using Cathala's method with some modifications.10,15 Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the total RNA sample using Oligotex dT30 super (Takara Inc.) or an Oligo(dT) cellulose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from each mRNA sample using commercially available cDNA synthesis kits, such as Superscript II plasmid system (Gibco BRL Co.), Timesaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), or SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all preparations, oligo-dT primers were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. The resultant cDNAs were inserted unidirectionally into a vector—pSPORT1 (Gibco BRL Co.), pBluescriptII SK(+) (Stratagene), or λTripEx2 (Clontech)—then introduced into Escherichia coli strain DH5α, JM109, or XL1Blue. The E. coli clones were arbitrarily picked and then plasmids carrying the A. oryzae cDNA were prepared.2.3. Nucleotide sequencing and sequence analysesNucleotide sequences of cDNA clones were determined using automated DNA sequencing machines by standard sequencing methods. Vector sequences and low-quality sequences were removed by hand. Sequence assembly of the raw EST data was performed using the program Phrap (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html). Assembly conditions used were: minimum length of matching word, 50; minimum alignment score, 30; repeat stringency, 0.95.Similarity searches against public non-redundant protein databases were carried out using BLASTX on the National Center for Biotechnology Information web server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The EST contigs were classified into KOG categories according to the results of BLASTX searches against amino acid sequences in the KOG set (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/).16 These sequence similarities were judged to be significant when the expected-value (E-value) was less than 1E-9 at the amino acid sequence level.2.4. General techniques for nucleic acid manipulationNucleic acid manipulations not described earlier were performed using standard methods, as described by Sambrook et al.172.5. Cluster analysisA hierarchical cluster analysis of culture conditions was performed with the nearest neighbor-joining method, with STATISTICA software (StatSoft, Inc.), in which the normalized frequency values of the contigs were used as variations.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of the cDNA libraries and generation of ESTsThe major objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to accumulate gene resources for screening valuable genes and providing a substantial informational basis for post-genomic analyses; (ii) to construct a basis of gene finding in whole-genome analyses; and (iii) to collect frequency information of each EST for comparison of expression profiles among culture conditions. Characteristics of A. oryzae are known to differ markedly according to type of culture, such as LC or SC. Consequently, it was important to collect EST information from cDNA libraries obtained under various culture conditions. In this study, we selected nine diverse cultures that varied in many aspects: nutrients, temperature, pH, and physical phase of media (liquid or solid-state). The biological and industrial importance of the cultures examined is outlined in what follows.In the laboratory, LC is the most important type of culture in regular use for ease of treatment. Nevertheless, LC is inferior to SC used in industrial applications because of the low levels of enzyme productivity.8 However, the use of LC is preferable to SC from the viewpoint of culture engineering. Physical simplicity of the systems is a salient advantage of LC. The conditions of LC (medium composition, degree of aeration, and temperature) can be controlled easily according to specific requirements.18 In future advanced utilization of A. oryzae, LC would therefore be preferred to SC if the weak points of LC could be resolved. ‘Liquid nutrient-rich culture’ (cultivation in YPD medium at 30°C) was designed as a standard LC condition, and provided the LR library. Here, we set three other LC conditions as modified variations of LR to obtain EST information in LCs at higher temperature (LH library), under conditions of maltose induction (LM library), and under conditions of carbon starvation (LS library). In particular, induction of various amylolytic enzymes by maltose has been focused as a model system for regulation of gene expression, and in addition, applied to artificial gene expression systems.8,11,12 EST analyses of these variations were expected to yield valuable information regarding basic metabolism, adaptation to different conditions, etc.Collecting ESTs from the LG library that originated in conidia and germinating conidia would yield information regarding the gene expression profile in the early stages of growth of filamentous fungi. Such information may be useful for elucidating the biological events during germination and for the development of techniques for controlling germination in industrial applications.A. oryzae is adaptable to a wide range of pH. In traditional procedures of industrial conidia preparation, which are dependent on alkaline adaptability of A. oryzae, the pH of the culture medium is shifted to alkaline (ca. pH 10) by sprinkling with wood-ash thereby preventing microbial contaminants, and conidia formation is facilitated by alkaline conditions.11 However, gene expression behavior under conditions of alkaline pH remains poorly understood. Alkaline plate culture was employed to construct a PA library as a model for alkaline adaptation to obtain EST information.Generally, A. oryzae mycelia cultured on agar plates show properties intermediate between those from LC and SC. On agar plates, asexual development occurs in late culture phase as in SC, whereas the levels of enzyme productivity are low as in LC.19 However, enzyme productivity is a more important mycelial property for industrial use, and consequently, we treated PA cultures as a variation of LC in this study.SC is the traditional culture method, and remains the typical method for industrial utilization of A. oryzae because of its superiority over LC in the productivity of secreted enzymes.8A. oryzae has recently been considered a strong host candidate for heterologous protein production both because it is a eukaryote and because of its safety and remarkable behavior, i.e. high productivity of secreted enzymes.20,21 The EST information from SCs would provide some insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the high levels of productivity of secreted proteins. It would also be available as an abundant gene resource for rapid screening of novel proteins, such as valuable enzymes. In SC, optimal cereal materials are chosen as substrates according to the cultivation objective.8,18 The present study employed three major solid-state substrates as media for EST collection: wheat bran (SW library), defatted soybeans with wheat kernel flour (SS library), and polished rice (SR library), which are used in manufacturing processes of commercial enzymes, shoyu (soy sauce), and Japanese sake, respectively. As noteworthy nutrient features, SS medium contains protein in high ratio, and SR medium contains starch in high ratio.Cultivation was performed as described in Section 2.1. Poly(A)+RNAs were isolated from them, followed by preparation of cDNA libraries, which were inserted unidirectionally into a vector. None of the cDNA libraries were normalized, thereby maintaining the original abundance ratio of transcripts to the greatest possible degree. Resultant E. coli colonies were picked arbitrarily and subjected to single-pass sequencing from the 5′ end of the cDNA insert. Ultimately, 21 446 partial cDNA sequences were accumulated as ESTs.3.2. General features of the ESTsSubsequently, 21 446 ESTs were assembled to 2854 non-redundant consensus sequences (contigs) and 4735 singletons, which appeared in the total ESTs with frequency 1. Singletons can be recognized as lone contigs showing no overlap with other ESTs, and hence we treated all of these 7589 independent sequences including the singletons as contigs in this study.Nevertheless, when each contig was assigned to the genomic region of A. oryzae,14 2635 contigs were originated from 1157 protein-encoding genes. We assumed several reasons for this redundancy as follows: (i) since it is generally difficult to obtain full-length cDNA from an oligo-dT primed cDNA library, multiple non-overlapping contigs can be generated from the same gene by difference of 5′ end truncation among cDNA clones; (ii) Diversity of transcription initiation site in the same gene may also cause multiple non-overlapping contigs same as (i); (iii) cDNAs alternatively spliced or containing introns failed to be spliced may cause multiple contigs from the same gene. If the incompleteness of reverse transcription and splicing were stringently considered, the total number of the genes corresponding to EST contigs was less than 7589, and at approximately 6100 minimum. However, we did not have enough information to accurately evaluate the actual reason for the multiple transcripts in each case, and accordingly, all the multiple contigs from the same gene were treated as independent contigs in this report.The sequence length distributions of raw ESTs and contigs were analyzed. The average length and total length of raw ESTs were 569 bases and 12.20 Mb, respectively. These values for the contigs were 658 bases and 5.00 Mb, respectively (Fig. 1). Overall length distribution shifted upwards after assembling raw ESTs, and approximately 180 contigs longer than 1.5 kb were generated. However, probably because of the high ratio (62.4%) of singletons within all contigs, mode values of raw ESTs and contigs both belonged to the same class, i.e. 501–600 bases. The total length of contigs (5.00 Mb) and number of contigs (7589) corresponded to 13.5% of the whole-genome size (37.05 Mb) and 54.0% of the number of predicted ORFs (14 063), respectively (Fig. 1, Table 1).14Sequence length distribution of raw ESTs and contigs.

Redundancies among the libraries were not removed.General features of the raw ESTs and contigs are summarized by source cDNA library in Table 1. Frequency distributions of the contigs are shown in Fig. 2A–C. Of the total 7589 contigs, 4735 (62.4%) were singletons. Contigs with frequencies of no more than five accounted for over 90% of the total number of contigs (Fig. 2A). The average frequency of total ESTs was 2.83 (Table 1, Fig. 2A). Average frequencies by source cDNA libraries tended to be correlated with numbers of raw ESTs. Numbers of singletons within contigs by the source cDNA library tended to increase in proportion to the number of collected raw ESTs, whereas the ratios of singletons were distributed around 35–55% of the contigs in all cases without a significant pattern (Table 1).Frequency distribution of the contigs.

(A) Total EST contigs. (B) EST contigs of known sequence. (C) EST contigs with no significant similarity.Contigs consisting of raw ESTs obtained from only a specific cDNA library appeared to be unique to the library, and these sequences were not obtained from other libraries. These contigs were designated ‘unique contigs’ in this report. The singletons fall into the unique contigs. The ratios of unique contigs by source library were distributed around 40–60% in all cases with no significant pattern, and singletons accounted for over roughly 80% of the unique contigs in most cases (Table 1). The number of unique contigs was approximately correlated with the number of raw ESTs. The total number of unique contigs was 5491 and accounted for 72.4% of all contigs (Table 1). This remarkably large ratio of unique contigs, including singletons, showed that independently expressed sequences were collected efficiently by our strategy, i.e. the use of diverse (as many as nine) cDNA libraries for EST sources.The deduced amino acid sequences of EST contigs were compared with the non-redundant public protein database using BLASTX. However, sequences derived from genome sequencing of Aspergilli were not considered as targets for similarity searches because this would mask the distribution of sequences similar to the query in the database.The results of the analysis indicated that 2953 (38.9%) and 793 (10.5%) contigs showed significant similarity to annotated sequences and to hypothetical proteins, respectively. The remaining 3843 (50.6%) contigs had no significant similarity to sequences deposited in the public databases (Tables 1 and 2). The latter would be novel sequences, correspond to non-coding RNA gene, or untranslated regions of mRNA of protein coding gene. The ratios of the contigs, by the source cDNA library, with no significant similarity to sequences in the public databases, were distributed around 35–45%, except for the LG library (Table 1). The extremely high value in the LG library (61.1%) may be because events occurring during the germination stage of A. oryzae are more poorly understood at the molecular level than those at other mycelial stages or under culture conditions.Results of similarity search against the public non-redundant protein databaseaSimilarity to deduced amino acid sequences with no definitive functions.Results of similarity search against the public non-redundant protein databaseaSimilarity to deduced amino acid sequences with no definitive functions.A marked tendency was seen between the results of the similarity search and frequency of raw EST in contigs, i.e. redundancy of the contigs. Fig. 2B and C indicate that the frequencies of raw EST in contigs of function-unknown sequences (showing no significant similarity with sequences in the databases) were lower than those of contigs similar to known sequences. The average frequencies of total contigs, that of contigs similar to known sequences and that of contigs of function-unknown sequences, were 2.83, 3.85, and 1.82, respectively (Fig. 2A–C). That is, the lower frequency group tended to contain a higher ratio contigs homologous to function-unknown sequences than the higher frequency group (data not shown). Low-frequency genes have fewer opportunities to be noticed for research than high-frequency genes, and hence their functions may tend to remain unknown.3.3. Frequency analysis of the EST contigsNo cDNA libraries used in this study were experimentally normalized during library preparation, and therefore they were expected to retain the populations of the original mRNAs almost entirely. Thus, the frequency information of ESTs from the contigs is likely to reflect the populations of the cDNA library. Consequently, gene transcription profiles would be roughly predictable by comparative analysis of frequency information from the library or type of culture used. However, simple comparative analysis of the raw frequency value would not reach plausible frequency information because numbers of the collected ESTs ranged widely in the cDNA libraries examined (Table 1). Accordingly, frequency information of raw ESTs among all contigs was numerically normalized by the source cDNA library to frequency value per 1000 ESTs, which we termed the ‘normalized frequency value,’ and used for subsequent frequency analysis.Supplementary Table S1 shows a ranking of the most frequent contigs from the total EST contig list by normalized frequency value. Here, a number of basic metabolic pathway genes and so-called housekeeping genes, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, translation factors, or histones, were placed in the upper part of the total frequency ranking. Many of these contigs were genes showing nonspecific expression among various cultures (Supplementary Table S1). However, some library-specific or culture type-specific contigs with extremely high normalized frequency values were also included in this list (Supplementary Tables S1–S12). The average normalized frequency values within culture type such as the LC and the SC were compared and most frequent LC- and SC-specific contigs were extracted (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). In terms of the environment for A. oryzae, the most major difference in culture types would be the physical phase of the medium: i.e. liquid phase or solid phase. The differences between the liquid and solid-state media range over many aspects, e.g. water activity, diffusion of nutrients and gases, continuity of medium distribution, physical barriers for hyphal extension invading the substrates, etc.10,18,19 To adapt to these environmental differences, A. oryzae would change its gene expression profile between LC and SC.10,22 Further detailed analyses of the frequency by cultivation conditions, i.e. LC and SC, may provide some insights into the critical factors required for differential transcriptional regulation. Such studies may also allow discovery of valuable (regulatable and/or strong) promoters, and facilitate industrial utilization.23 Moreover, functional analyses of such genes with biased expression profiles may reveal mechanisms for generating differences in mycelial characteristics among cultivation conditions. Such analyses may also reveal advantages of SC as efficient enzyme-producing systems.Although many of the contigs in Supplementary Table S2 or S3 were not obtained solely from a particular LC or SC library, some contigs were library-specific, such as AoEST2714 (Supplementary Tables S2 and S8: similar to conidiation-specific protein 10 of Neurospora crassa), AoEST2823 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S11: similar to lactone hydrolase of Rhodococcus ruber), AoEST2980 (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4: similar to hexose transporter of Aspergillus parasiticus), AoEST2991 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S12: encoding aspergillopepsin O), AoEST3150 (Supplementary Tables S1, S2, and S8: no significant similarity to sequences in databases). Their appearance in these tables was due to their extremely high normalized frequency values in each source library.Frequency rankings of particular culture-specific contigs are shown in Supplementary Tables S4–S12. Parameters of each culture employed in this study, even if excluding the LC- or SC-specific features, differed with other culture conditions in some physical, chemical, and/or biological respects, e.g. nutrient contents, temperature, growth phase, and/or other environmental factors. Consequently, lists of library-specific or -biased frequent contigs may reflect the gene expression profiles due to some individual features of each set of culture conditions (Supplementary Tables S4–S12).Approximately 30–70% of the contigs with frequency biased to a particular library, except the LR library, in which the ratio was greater than 90%, showed similarity to known sequences in the databases. Laboratory cultivation of A. oryzae is generally done under LR culture conditions, and genes that show good expression under such conditions, such as genes that participate in glycolytic pathways, have tended to be targeted for investigation. Consequently, the ratio of genes with unknown function in LR may be lower than under other culture conditions. The approach to functional and expressional analyses on such genes with expression profiles biased to a particular type of culture (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) or set of culture conditions (Supplementary Tables S4–S12) may be helpful for understanding the behavior of A. oryzae under these conditions.The major genes for secreted enzymes necessary for the sake brewing process appeared frequently in several rankings: alpha-amylase, which is a starch-liquefying enzyme (AoEST2370, AoEST3004, AoEST3185; Supplementary Tables S1, S6, and S9); glucoamylase, which is a diastatic enzyme (AoEST03182; Supplementary Tables S1 and S3); and Aspergillopepsin O, which is an acid protease and contributes to liquefaction of rice materials (AoEST2991; Supplementary Tables S3 and S12). The ESTs of the latter two enzyme genes were obtained SC- or SR-specifically (Supplementary Tables S3 and S12). This is consistent with the results of previous studies, and the reported superiority of SC in the sake brewing process.9,12,24 In addition to contigs obtained under a particular set of culture conditions (Supplementary Tables S4–S12), it is interesting that a considerable number of function-unknown genes appeared in the upper parts of Supplementary Tables S1–S3. This suggests that some major but unnoticed features expressed constitutively in common to LC or SC remain in functional, physiological, and/or structural aspects of A. oryzae.Supplementary Tables S1–S12 contain ORF ID which was registered in the A. oryzae genome database and correspond to each contigs. However, some of them and some contigs not shown in these tables did not correspond to any ORF in the database although there were corresponding genomic nucleotide sequences. They should correspond to non-coding RNA genes, untranslated region of transcripts, or could fail to be predicted as ORFs. In addition, nucleotide sequence corresponding to AoEST2089 (Supplementary Table S9: no similarity to any sequence in databases) and some others not shown in Supplementary Tables S1–S12 were not found in the genome database. There are several sequence gaps in A. oryzae genome information,14 and they are perhaps mapped to one of those regions, respectively.Next, using all the EST frequency data converted to normalized frequency values, the culture conditions employed for collection of ESTs in this study were classified by a hierarchical clustering method, and the results are illustrated as a dendrogram in Fig. 3. In this figure, LS and SW were clustered as the most similar groups, and SR was next clustered with them, and followed by LM. A previous study suggested a similarity between SC and starved-LC. SC-specific genes were identified by cDNA subtraction, and some were also transcribed in stationary phase, but not in the growth phase in LC.10 Closeness on the dendrogram between LS and these SCs, SW and SR, may be due to a common environmental factor under these culture conditions: i.e. insufficiency of nutrients. The carbon source is deficient in LS, and available nitrogen and carbon sources tend to be deficient in SC, especially in the early stages because of the time lag in hydrolysis of substrates by lytic enzymes and limited diffusion of the resultant nutrients.10,18Dendrogram of culture conditions used for collecting ESTs. Culture conditions were classified based on the normalized frequency values of contigs by hierarchical clustering using the nearest neighbor-joining method.Dendrogram of culture conditions used for collecting ESTs. Culture conditions were classified based on the normalized frequency values of contigs by hierarchical clustering using the nearest neighbor-joining method.Some ESTs unusually redundant (over 30.0) in a particular culture condition (AoEST3150 and AoEST3179 in LG, and AoEST3164, AoEST3186, and AoEST3189 in SS) (Supplementary Tables S1–S3, S8, and S11) affected neighbor-joining distance of the clusters that contained the above contigs (Fig. 2). In fact, the cluster, LG, which positioned off from the other clusters except SS, moved inside the tree consisting of those clusters when analyzed excluding the two contigs discussed earlier (data not shown). The proteins encoded on those highly redundant contigs may play important roles specifically in the two culture conditions, however, their functions are currently unpredictable based on the sequence similarity to the genes of known functions.3.4. Functional classification by KOG major categoriesContig sequences were compared with the eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs), which consist of several eukaryotic ORF sequence sets, by BLASTX (Fig. 4A and B), and classified into KOG categories of similar sequence.16 Of the 7589 contigs, 2964 contigs showed similarity with the KOG sequence set. A portion of these contigs belonged to multiple categories. If the categorical redundancy was not removed, the total number of contigs, 2964, corresponded to 3284 categorized contigs. Meanwhile, 4625 contigs did not hit to any of KOG sequence. In the following discussion, we expediently considered the group of these 4625 contigs as one category, ‘No hit to KOGs’ (Fig. 4A and B), and accordingly, total number of categorized contigs was 7909. Of these contigs, 2914 (36.8%) were classified into the functional categories, including ‘Poorly characterized,’ of the corresponding counterpart in the KOGs, whereas the remaining 370 (4.7%) had no KOG categories (Fig. 4A, numerical values not shown). They were also classified into the major KOG categories by culture type category, such as SC and LC (Fig. 4A), or by source library (Fig. 4B). The ratios of KOG categories from LC, SC, or each library showed similar patterns to total contigs, except for LG (Fig. 4A and B). Similarly, the results of BLASTX search of the non-redundant database also showed an abundance of function-unknown sequences within A. oryzae EST sequences, especially in the case of contigs containing raw ESTs derived from the LG library (Fig. 2A, Tables 1 and 2).Functional classification of contigs to major KOG categories. Contigs were compared with the KOG sequence set using BLASTX, and then classified into the major KOG major categories of most similar sequence (E-value < 10E-9). Categorical redundancy of contigs was not removed when they belonged to multiple KOG categories. (A) Total contigs, contigs from LCs, and contigs from SCs (B) contigs from each library.Functional classification of contigs to major KOG categories.

Categorical redundancy of contigs was not removed when they belonged to multiple KOG categories. (A) Total contigs, contigs from LCs, and contigs from SCs (B) contigs from each library.It is noteworthy that a large number of contigs, as many as 4625 (58.5% of 7909, 60.9% of 7589) had no significant counterpart in the KOGs (Fig. 4A, numerical values not shown). The contigs without similarity to KOGs may correspond to some genes with functional similarity to genes of KOGs, but no structural similarity. However, it is more likely that large segments of these sequences are involved in biological functions or characteristics of filamentous fungi lacking in the model eukaryote genomes: e.g. filamentous growth, hyphal differentiation, asexual development, high-capacity protein secretion, various enzymes themselves, and certain secondary metabolism pathways. Therefore, we inferred that these sequences, in preference to other sequences, may be effective for the study of characteristics unique to filamentous fungi.3.5. Absence of sequences derived from aflatoxins-biosynthetic genes in the EST collectionCertain species that belong to the genus Aspergillus, such as A. parasiticus and A. flavus, closely related species of A. oryzae, produce aflatoxins (AF)—highly toxic products of secondary metabolism, which have carcinogenicity and acute toxicity. Approximately, 25 genes involved in AF biosynthesis are located in a 70-kb genomic region as a cluster.25 A member of this cluster, the gene aflR, encodes a transcription factor that positively regulates expression of the AF biosynthetic genes, including aflR itself, by a feedforward mechanism, and therefore has a crucial role in AF biosynthesis in these species. In aflatoxinogenic A. flavus, the AF biosynthetic genes must be functional under AF-producing culture conditions. Indeed, it has been reported that an A. flavus EST collection obtained under these culture conditions contained 21 of the total of 25 AF biosynthetic genes in the cluster region.5In contrast, none of the known strains of A. oryzae produce AF under any conditions. Certain A. oryzae strains either entirely (group III) or partially (group II) lack the cluster region in their genomes, and therefore cannot produce AF.26,27 However, another type of A. oryzae (group I), including the RIB40 strain used in this study, contains the entire AF biosynthetic homologous gene cluster region.26,27 Although the long history of use in food industries has demonstrated the safety of A. oryzae, including the group I strains, the reasons for the safety of group I strains have not been clarified at the molecular level. Sequences of the cluster region in the RIB 40 genome27 were compared with all EST contig sequences. No aflR-like sequence was found among the contigs, although AF-producing culture conditions of aflatoxinogenic species, such as SC, were included in sources of the ESTs. This was consistent with a previous study in which no aflR-like transcripts of A. oryzae were detected under AF-producing conditions.28 Moreover, no other sequences in the AF biosynthetic homologous gene cluster were found in the EST contigs, except for only two singletons: aflJ (also named aflS)-like AoEST3534 from SR and aflT-like AoEST4046 from LR (both not shown in Supplementary Tables S1–S12).25,27 It was reported that aflJ is involved in regulation of the pathway by mechanisms that are as yet unclear,25 and aflT may encode a major facilitator superfamily transporter with no significant roles in AF secretion.29If the AF pathway were activated in RIB40, a series of ESTs from the pathway genes, including the aflR-like gene, would have been obtained, as in the case of A. flavus.5 In A. oryzae RIB40, none of the AF biosynthetic homologs seemed to be transcriptionally activated by lack of transcription of the aflR-like gene, even under conditions that would result in AF production in the related species. These observations provide circumstantial evidence for the safety of A. oryzae as an industrial microorganism. However, the reason for the inactive aflR-like gene remains to be determined.3.6. Application of the EST resource for further studiesThis study provided not only numerous ESTs from A. oryzae, but also a vast collection of cDNA clones. Consequently, cDNA clones of novel genes can be obtained rapidly in many cases through in silico screening of the EST database instead of using conventional wet screening methods. Several studies have already cloned genes using the EST information.30–45 This study also provided the foundations for post-genomic approaches in A. oryzae.22,46 The clone collection is available for preparation of probes for transcriptome analyses. The sequence information deduced at the amino acid level can be exploited for proteome analyses. In addition, ESTs generally supply useful information for ORF prediction in whole-genome sequencing of eukaryotes. Indeed, the EST database markedly contributed to the A. oryzae whole-genome analysis project.14The EST data is available on our website (http://www.nrib.go.jp/ken/EST/db/index.html or http://www.aist.go.jp/RIODB/ffdb/EST-DB.html). Nucleotide sequences of the EST contigs have been deposited in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databanks (accession numbers AB223171–AB230863, including some vacant numbers). Genome sequence information of each EST contigs is referrable on the A. oryzae genome database (http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/Top).

IntroductionLupinus is a genus of self- or cross-pollinating, mostly indeterminate plant species native to diverse geographic regions.1,2 Lupins are considered to be polyploid in origin and are found in both the New and Old Worlds. Old World species exhibit different basic chromosome numbers,3 a large variation in the number of their chromosomes, and a 2.5-fold variation in their estimated 2C DNA values.4 They are subdivided into the Scabrispermae (rough-seeded) and the Malacospermae (smooth-seeded) to which white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) belongs in conjunction with two other cultivated species: L. angustifolius and L. luteus. White lupin has a diploid chromosome number of 50 and a 2C DNA content of 1.16 ± 0.044 pg.4Lupin species have a relatively short domestication history compared with most crops. Focused breeding efforts began in Germany during World War I due to a need for high-protein pulse crops adapted to temperate conditions. Subsequent breeding has concentrated on the introduction of key traits such as early flowering, reduced pod-shattering, soft seed, and anthracnose disease resistance.5,6 Lupin grain is high in protein (30–40%) and like soybean is high in dietary fibre (30%), low in oil (6%), and contains minimal starch. Lupin has the lowest Glycaemic Index of any commonly consumed grain (www.glycemicindex.com), which has significant implications for Western societies with an increasing incidence of obesity and associated risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.7 Lupin fibre acts as a soluble fibre and drops total cholesterol levels without affecting beneficial HDL cholesterol.8White lupin itself is used as feed for livestock and has established a growing market for human consumption due to the development of low alkaloid varieties with a lack of protease inhibitors.9,10 In addition, white lupin has become an illuminating model for the study of plant adaptation to extreme phosphorus (P) deficiency.11,12 Adaptation to low P is linked to modifications of root development and biochemistry resulting in proteoid (or cluster) roots.13–15Comparative genetic mapping has been studied in many families of crops such as cereals and crucifers,16–19 and also in legumes.20–22 More recently, the first comparative map in Lupinus was developed between L. angustifolius and the model legume Medicago truncatula,23 and subsequently a preliminary comparison was reported between L. albus and M. truncatula.24Initial comparative mapping studies predominantly used common enzymes, morphological markers, and RFLP probes.25,26 These have been superseded by PCR-based codominant marker systems that have markedly increased the efficiency and reduced the cost of transferring genetic information across species. In this approach, oligonucleotide primers are designed from sequences of conserved regions such as gene exons that span polymorphic introns or microsatellites to produce ITAPs (intron targeted amplified polymorphic sequence). Examples include the comparison of Medicago truncatula with alfalfa, chickpea, faba bean, narrow-leafed lupin, and pea.23,27–32To date only a preliminary genetic map showing three linkage groups (LGs) has been published for white lupin.24 The aims of this study were (1) to construct a complete genetic map of L. albus using orthologous gene-based codominant markers and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)33 markers, as a resource for comparing lupin genomes and in legume evolution studies; (2) to map key agronomic traits including anthracnose resistance, low alkaloid content, and flowering time; and (3) to assess the extent of conserved synteny between L. albus and the model legume M. truncatula.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genetic mapping populationOne hundred and ninety-five F8-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were used to phenotype traits. This population was developed from a cross between cv. Kiev Mutant and an Ethiopian landrace P27174. Kiev Mutant was bred by Dr V.I. Golovchenko of the Ukrainian Agricultural Research Institute, Kiev and was first released in the USSR in 1969. Kiev Mutant was first introduced into Australia by CSIRO in 1972 and subsequently released by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food in 1982. This variety has low alkaloid content and is early flowering but is highly susceptible to anthracnose. P27174 has high alkaloid levels (<1%), is late flowering, and is resistant to anthracnose disease.To produce the RIL population, Kiev Mutant was used as the female parent and P27174 as the male. The F8 RIL population was primarily made to identify molecular markers linked to anthracnose resistance genes, but variation also exists for other traits such as flowering time, alkaloid content, plant height, pod shape, order of podding, branching, leaf colour and size, brown markings on stems and yield. Only the first three characters were phenotyped for this study. From the 195 F8 RILs, a subset of 94 was randomly chosen for comparative mapping. Total genomic DNA was extracted as previously described by Ellwood et al.342.2. Anthracnose resistance phenotypingThe F8 lines were tested against anthracnose from 2004 to 2005 in a disease nursery. The nursery was established in a high rainfall site at Medina, Western Australia, and supplemented with irrigation as required. Spreader rows consisting of a mixture of the susceptible cvs. Kiev Mutant, Wodjil, and Myallie were planted a week before the test lines. The whole population consisting of 195 RILs together with parental controls were planted in 2 m long rows in three replicates between the spreader rows. The test rows were perpendicular to the spreader rows to enable flow of the disease inoculum from both sides. After 3–4 weeks of planting, glasshouse infected Kiev Mutant seedlings were transplanted into the spreader rows at approximately 1 m spacing to ensure a high level of early inoculum. The disease was assessed twice during the season employing a score of 1–5, where 1 is highly resistant and 5 is extremely susceptible. The second, usually higher, scores were used to determine the resistance level of a line.2.3. Flowering timeFlowering time of F8 RILs was recorded when 50% plants in a test row had one open flower with an erect standard petal on the main stem inflorescence. Due to a large variation in flowering times among lines, the flowering time for each line was recorded in weeks, rather than days, relative to the earliest flowering parent Kiev Mutant. For example, lines that flowered as early as Kiev Mutant were categorized into week 1.2.4. Alkaloid contentThe F8 lines were scored for alkaloid content using two techniques, the Dragendorff paper test and by ultra violet (UV) fluorescence. Pink discolouration of Dragendorff paper indicated high alkaloid content and a white or bleached discolouration indicated no or low alkaloids. Tests were conducted using sap from the petiole of a young leaflet from seedlings at the 8–9 leaf-stage. Similarly, after harvesting seeds were viewed under an UV lamp (Vilber Lourmat, France) at 365 nm. Seeds with a high alkaloid content are fluorescent pink under UV light, whereas those with low alkaloids levels are dull whitish.2.5. Gene-based PCR markersSix hundred and twenty-six genic markers belonging to three sets of ITAP primers were utilized in this study.27 These were composed of three sets of ITAPs; the ‘ML’ primers, that were developed from alignment between M. truncatula and Lupinus spp. EST sequences.23 A small proportion of these markers were designed to span microsatellite motifs rather than introns; the ‘MLG’ primers were designed from alignment of M. truncatula, L. albus, and Glycine max EST sequences;27 and the cross-species ‘MP’ markers developed at the Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, USA.20 The majority of the ITAP primers were from genes in characterized chromosomal regions, and therefore the L. albus mapped markers could be physically mapped in M. truncatula using M. truncatula BACs.2.6. Polymorphism detectionEach primer pair was screened on L. albus parental DNA.23 Single PCR products of the same size were purified and directly sequenced. DNA polymorphisms were identified by manual inspection of alignments and chromatograms using Vector NTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Different procedures were used to genotype the F8 population depending on types of polymorphism identified.272.7. AFLP markersAFLP markers were generated as described by Nelson et al.23 and Vos et al.,33 using one selective nucleotide for pre-amplification (EcoRI-C and MseI-A) and two selective nucleotides for selective amplification. The AFLP products were resolved with an AB3730 DNA Sequencer using a GeneScan™ -500 LIZ® Size Standard [Applied Biosystems (AB), Foster City, California, USA]. Data were analysed by the automated allele calling parameters in GeneMapper® (AB). Marker nomenclature included the name of selective marker combination; either A or B depending on whether inherited from Kiev mutant or P27274, respectively; and the marker size (in bp).2.8. Genetic, comparative, and QTL mappingNinety-four F8 RILs were scored for polymorphic gene-based and AFLP molecular markers together with three agronomic traits (anthracnose resistance, alkaloid, and flowering time). Genetic linkage mapping was conducted with MultiPoint v. 1.2 software (MultiQTL Ltd, Institute of Evolution, Haifa University, Israel). The Kosambi mapping function was used to convert the recombination frequencies into genetic distance (cM). Chi-square analysis (P < 0.05) was applied to test the segregation of the mapped markers against the expected Mendelian segregation ratio for codominant inheritance in an F8 RIL population. Groups of linked markers that were similarly distorted were accepted for linkage mapping and QTL analysis. Independent markers showing significant segregation distortion and markers with missing data (>10%) were rejected for linkage and QTL analysis to avoid bias and false linkages.Markers mapped in L. albus were located on the M. truncatula map by aligning marker EST template sequences using BLASTN to phases 1, 2 and 3 sequenced BACs (Build 17.06.06, http://www.medicago.org/). Alignments with a BLAST E-values < 1 × 10−20, hsp identity ≥ 60%, and hsp length > 50 nt were retained.Association between each LG and the putative QTL regions related to flowering time and anthracnose resistance were determined by interval mapping using MultiQTL software, version 2.5 (MultiQTL Ltd, Institute of Evolution, Haifa University, Israel). Significance levels for each QTL detected were determined with 1000 permutations and the standard deviation (SD) for each QTL determined by 1000 Bootstraps. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using JMP-IN 5.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was also used to determine correlation between markers flanking each QTL and the corresponding trait. All QTLs identified were further confirmed with MapManager QTX v. b20.353. Results and discussion3.1. General features of the first L. albus genetic linkage mapA total of 325 markers consisting of 105 genic markers and 220 AFLP markers were used to generate the first comprehensive genetic linkage map for L. albus. Amplicon sequences have been submitted to Genbank under accession codes EI394666, EI394667, and EI392791–EI392938.The multilocus AFLPs were employed to generate sufficient markers to coalesce the LGs described by gene-based markers. This was necessary due to the large number of chromosomes in L. albus, (n = 25),4 and the tendency of conserved genes as genic markers to cluster in isolated blocks.36 Genic markers were chosen to enable syntenic relationships between L. albus and the model legume species, M. truncatula, to be established.Table 1 and Fig. 1 summarize general properties of the map. The map comprised 28 LGs, that varied in length from 246.5 to 22.7 cM and the total map length was 2951 cM. The average spacing between markers was 12.6 cM, determined at a recombination fraction (rf) of 0.27. In addition, there were seven pairs of linked markers. Unique placements within LGs could not be determined for 25 markers and 15 markers remained unlinked. Ambiguous markers positioning in Multipoint v. 1.2 may occur due to missing data, miss-genotyping, or rare recombination events that push out the length of the chromosome. The first two occurred in this study and are the result of residual heterozygosity in F8 lines. Thus, before mapping, ‘H's are removed from the data for co-dominant markers, while the dominant nature of AFLPs disguises otherwise co-dominant loci. Genic markers were evenly distributed throughout the genome with the exceptions of LGs 9, 14, and 28 which were composed only of AFLP markers. Only two examples of markers mapped to multiple loci occurred in this study: LSSR16 and LSSR33. Unlike RFLPs, ITAPs are limited in their ability to detect duplications. Exceptions occur when two or more amplicons for a given marker are of different lengths but share similar amplification intensities and are individually polymorphic between the parents.The first genetic linkage map of L. albus.

Segregation distortion has been commonly encountered in various plant species such as narrow-leafed lupin (9%),37 chickpea (20.4%),38 and is a common phenomenon in lentil.39 Many factors may be responsible for marker distortion such as structural rearrangement or differences in DNA content, non-random abortion of male and female gametes, and selection for or against a particular allele of one of the parents during propagation of RILs.40–43Few of the markers in this study were shared with L. angustifolius, which is partly due to the Kiev Mutant × P27174 cross being relatively narrow. This is evidenced in the number of polymorphic ITAP markers detected, 112/626 for L. albus and 108/424 for L. angustifolius.23 Of these only 24 were shared in common, and to describe synteny, two or more syntenic markers are required. Only two instances were found with two markers: LG63 and Lup3 (LG1 in L. albus and LG8 in L. angustifolius), and CPCB2 and Lup56 (LG24 in L. albus and LG2 in L. angustifolius). The three extra LGs in L. albus, compared to an expected chromosome number of 25,4 seven additional pairs, and 15 unlinked markers might be expected to coalesce and join to the ends of other LGs as more markers are mapped.3.2. Characteristics of genetic markersOf the 626 ITAP markers that were screened, 537 amplified in the L. albus genome. Three hundred and seventy-eight of these produced clear single band amplicons (Table 2). From these, 112 polymorphic markers were identified between Kiev Mutant and P27174 (Table 2), of which 105 were used to genotype the 94 individuals of the F8 RIL population (Supplementary Table S1). Chi-squared tests revealed 10 genic markers (about 10%) with distorted segregation (P < 0.05). Of the three genic marker groups, the ‘ML’ markers gave the highest amplification and polymorphism rates (95 and 35%, respectively; Table 2). The ‘MLG’ group amplified with a similar frequency, but fewer amplicons were polymorphic. The ‘MP’ primers amplified at a noticeably lower frequency (60%) but were slightly more polymorphic than the MLG group (Table 2). This data compliments previous studies in Lupinus angustifolius and Lens culinaris,23,27 and implies an association between the success rates of amplification in the target species based on the phlyogenetic context of primer design, and that primers based on conserved sequences between three species (i.e. MLG primers) may have more conserved introns.Efficiency of genic markers used to construct the comparative genetic linkage map of L. albusaPredominant modes of design: MP, markers primarily between M. truncatula and G.

This technique provides a useful complement to gene-based markers by joining together blocks of genic markers used to identify synteny, as shown between L. angustifolius and M. truncatula.23Two hundred and twenty-three discrete markers were generated from 64 selective primer combinations, of which 24 were codominant (i.e. A or B) and 199 dominant (i.e. present or absent). Of these 223 markers, 32 did not segregate in the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:1 (P < 0.05). However, only three of these distorted markers with P < 0.01 were excluded from the map construction process since the remaining markers did not interfere with LG construction.3.3. L. albus comparative mapping with M. truncatulaTo assess the level of synteny between L. albus and M. truncatula, the L. albus genetic map was compared to the most up-to-date version of the M. truncatula physical map. Forty-five of 97 (46%) orthologous markers that have been mapped in M. truncatula revealed evidence of conserved gene order between M. truncatula and L. albus. As shown in Fig. 2, there are numerous breaks in synteny between the two genomes that would be expected given the wide evolutionary distance and difference in chromosome number between the two species (M. truncatula, n = 8; L. albus, n = 25). The orthologous markers identified 17 small syntenic blocks of two or more markers on 17 separate LGs. The remaining 52 markers showed no evidence of macrosynteny, and 15 were unlinked.Evidence of macrosynteny between L. albus and M. truncatula genomes.

Orthologous markers joining L. albus and M. truncatula LGs are indicated by broken lines. Distances for M. truncatula markers are provided in cM.These results imply genome fragmentation, or duplication followed by divergence and selective loss of chromosomes. This would break down lengthy stretches of syntenic chromosome segments observed between closely related legumes, such as those detected between M. truncatula and L. culinaris,27M. truncatula and M. sativa,30 and M. sativa and Pisum sativum.21 Frequently, two or more loci originating from different L. albus LGs were syntenic with a common M. truncatula chromosome. This supports a hypothesis of polyploidization followed by rearrangements, and gene divergence or selective loss of genes and chromosomal fragments. Macrosynteny restricted only to small genomic intervals was also observed between L. angustifolius and M. truncatula,23 where only 95 of 181 common markers between the two genomes were mapped into 11 small conserved regions, and has been reported in other comparative studies between distantly related legumes such as M. truncatula and soybean.22Each of the eight M. truncatula chromosomes showed corresponding syntenic regions in L. albus, with the exception of chromosome 6. This augments previous results between L. angustifolius and M. truncatula,23 and between M. truncatula and more closely related legume species.20 Chromosome 6 is the smallest M. truncatula chromosome, contains few conserved genes,20 a large proportion of resistance genes,44 and is responsible for the different chromosome numbers between M. truncatula and field pea (P. sativum),21,30 and between M. truncatula and chickpea (Cicer arietinum).223.4. Segregation of agronomic traitsOne hundred and ninety-one F8 RILs were phenotyped for anthracnose resistance, alkaloid content, and flowering time. The phenotypic distribution of the anthracnose resistance and flowering time were continuous suggesting that these traits were quantitatively inherited (W > 0.05). ANOVA indicated genetic variation between the recombination inbred lines (r2 = 0.89, P < 0.001 for anthracnose resistance and r2 = 0.76 with P < 0.0001 for flowering time). The means of disease scores and flowering time for parental lines and the F8 population are shown in Fig. 3.Frequency distribution of disease scores for anthracnose resistance (A) and flowering time (B) in 195 L. albus F8 RILs developed from Kiev Mutant and P27174. Three replicates were conducted. The mean disease scores of the anthracnose resistant and susceptible parents are indicated by the letters S and R, respectively. The mean scores of flowering time of the parents are indicated with black arrows. The mean scores of disease and flowering time for all F8 RILs are indicated with white arrows.Frequency distribution of disease scores for anthracnose resistance (A) and flowering time (B) in 195 L. albus F8 RILs developed from Kiev Mutant and P27174.

The mean scores of flowering time of the parents are indicated with black arrows. The mean scores of disease and flowering time for all F8 RILs are indicated with white arrows.Two methods (Dragendorff and UV) were used to determine alkaloid content. The segregation ratio among the RILs was similar in both the methods (89:94 and 88:91, low alkaloid:high alkaloid content, using the Dragendorff and U/V tests, respectively. 1:1, P < 0.05) This suggested a single gene controls alkaloid content. The scores from the two tests were highly correlated (r = 0.85, P = 0.00001, for n = 192).3.5. QTL mapping of anthracnose resistanceThe frequency distribution of anthracnose disease resistance scores in L. albus was continuous implying polygenic control. Interval mapping conducted with MultiQTL software detected two regions significantly associated with anthracnose resistance on LG4 and LG17 at an LOD > 3 (Fig. 1). These QTLs explain over 31 and 26% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, and were inherited from the resistant parent P27174. ANOVA also revealed significant correlation with resistance of two flanking markers (Lup241 and M47E35A209) on LG4 (P < 0.0018 and P < 0.0004, respectively) and two others (Lup313 and M65E35C315 both with P < 0.0001) on LG17. No epistatic interactions were identified between QTLs and unlinked markers using the interactions function in Map Manager QTX. The major QTL on LG17 and a second on LG4 conferring resistance contrasts with L. angustifolius, where a single gene was found to be responsible.373.6. QTL mapping of flowering timeFlowering is an important stage in plant development that initiates grain production and is sensitive to stress. The frequency distribution of flowering time was normal in this study, consistent with the polygenic control of this trait observed in other crops. In Arabidopsis, seven QTLs were detected controlling flowering time,45 while in chickpea and soybean, two and four QTLs were identified, respectively.46,47 This result in L. albus contrasts with previous mapping studies in L. angustifolius where flowering time was controlled by a major gene, Ku23.Two significant QTLs at the top of LG1 and LG3 at a LOD score of > 3 were detected using interval mapping (Fig. 1; Table 3), which together explain more than 52% of the total phenotypic variation. The strongest QTL, explaining 31% of the phenotypic variance at the top of LG3, covered a relatively wide distance of ∼10 cM. Due to population size and/or the number of recombinants in a particular region, interval mapping usually underestimates or is unable to identify the number of genes conditioning quantitative traits. Therefore two or more QTLs may be detected as a single QTL in small populations (<500 individuals) if closer together than ∼20 cM.48,49Estimates of QTLs determined using MultiQTL with significant effects on anthracnose resistance and flowering time in L. albus Kiev Mutant x P27174 F8 RILsaSDs are shown in parentheses.bLG and interval within LG associated with the quantitative trait.cProbability values from 1000 permutation tests.

In the present map, three AFLP markers (M61E32B396, M75E38A83, M75E38B73) cosegregate with the QTL at the end of the LG, suggesting that more markers will be needed to extend this LG to more precisely define the locus.A third QTL was identified on LG12 that accounted for 11% of the trait at an LOD = 2.4. However, Map Manager QTX did not support this QTL (data not shown). Single-point analysis showed four linked and/or flanking markers (M61E32B396 on LG1 and M47E32A266, M75E38A83, M75E38B73 on LG3) significantly associated with flowering time (P < 0.001). Markers M61E32B396 and M75E38B73 were inherited from Kiev Mutant, whereas M47E32A266 and M75E38A83 were from P27174. No epistatic interactions were detected between these QTLs or unlinked markers using the interactions function in Map Manager QTX.3.7. Genetic mapping of alkaloid contentA single locus determining alkaloid content mapped to LG11, flanked by markers M61E35A142 and Lup123 (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with the earlier results that Kiev Mutant has a single gene (pauper) for low alkaloid content.50 In L. angustifolius, alkaloid content was also found to be controlled by a single locus.23 Interestingly, Lup268 which flanks the QTL in L. albus, mapped to a separate chromosome to alkaloid content in L. angustifolius. This suggests either these two loci are independent or there has been rearrangement between the lupin genomes.3.8. Future prospects for the application of synteny in L. albusWhile synteny between L. albus and M. truncatula in this study was limited to small conserved blocks of genes, these may help in identifying more closely linked markers or candidate genes if desirable traits map to such regions. Where structural differences exist between more distantly related species such as M. truncatula and soybean, it is notable that significant microsynteny, or conservation at the DNA sequence level, exists.51 Thus one would expect progress in the application of both macro- and microsynteny to identify closely linked markers and to isolate important genes; precedents in other families include the Solanaceae,52 Poaceae,53–55 and Rosaceae.56Although the L. albus genetic and comparative map comprised more than 300 markers, there were not enough shared markers to make a detailed comparison of the L. albus and L. angustifolius genomes, as this is the most obvious way to investigate Genistoid evolution. More markers are also needed to consolidate the number of chromosomes and increase marker density. The present study provides markers associated with anthracnose and flowering QTLs that were significantly associated with these traits. More tightly linked molecular markers are required, however, for efficient marker-assisted selection in breeding programs involving these parental lines. Nevertheless, this research throws light on the processes of chromosomal evolution in the Genistoid clade, is the first report on the genetic mapping of economically important traits in L. albus, and forms the basis of a resource for the L. albus and legume research community.This research was supported by ARC Linkage project LP0454871 and NSW Department of Primary Industries.

IntroductionWith the unprecedented amount of data produced from both human genome1 and transcriptome2–6 projects, a new challenge of genome science is to decode how the code of the genomic DNA collectively realizes the transcriptome.7 To this end, it should be the first step to understand the code of DNA sequence to control the transcriptional initiation. Although, levels of transcripts are also controlled at post-transcription-initiation steps such as transcription elongation, splicing, nuclear export, degradation steps, and so on,8 transcription initiation is the first step in the gene expression of every gene and is supported to play fundamental roles.9,10It is known that, in many cases, the genomic regions proximal to the transcriptional start sites (TSSs), which are called promoters, play pivotal roles in determining the rate of transcription initiation by serving as direct docking platforms for the RNA polymerase II complex.9 However, the comprehensive view is still obscure regarding which part of the human genome the RNA polymerase II is recruited to and at what frequency the transcription is initiated. There are currently only 428 genes whose transcriptional regulation is well understood (TRANSFAC7.2).10 Besides, even for those genes, the promoter activities were measured under arbitrary experimental conditions, and are therefore inappropriate for use in deciphering the transcriptional network taking place in a particular cellular context or for comprehensive quantitative analyses of promoter activities encoded by DNA sequences.We have developed a method to construct a full-length cDNA library, which we named the oligo-capping,11 and have accumulated 1.8 million 5′-end sequences of putative full-length cDNAs.12 By utilizing the full-length cDNA information, we have been identifying exact genomic positions of the TSSs and characterizing the adjacent sequences as putative promoter regions (PPRs).13 So far we have made the collected information of the TSSs and PPRs for about 15 000 human genes available through our database, DBTSS (http://dbtss.hgc.jp/).In the present study, we attempted to obtain quantitative experimental data about the promoter activities within a particular cell, since such a data set should serve as a firm foundation for exploring the transcriptional network of human genes. We first collected and analyzed the promoter activities of DNA fragments corresponding to PPRs of genes which are expressed in human embryonic kidney epithelial 293 cells (HEK293 cells). Then, we analyzed the promoter activities of genomic DNA fragments which were randomly isolated from non-promoter regions. By this, we wished to understand the promoter activities intrinsic to primary DNA sequences. Unexpectedly, analysis of those DNA fragments led us to hypothesis that sometimes even average human genomic sequences come to have significant promoter activities and that a class of non-protein coding RNAs should be originated from sporadically occurring promoter activities of DNA sequences, which is inherent to a long genome such as human's. Here we report our systematic experimental characterization of the promoter activities of primary DNA sequences using a uniform experimental procedure and standardized cellular conditions.2. Material and methods2.1. Computational proceduresOligo-cap cDNA library was constructed from HEK293 cells (ATCC number CRL-1573) according to the procedure described previously. 12 504 one-pass sequences were produced and mapped onto the human genomic sequences (hg_17; http://genome.ucsc.edu/) as previously described.11 (We also confirmed that the update to hg_18 would make essentially no influence on the results.) The DNA sequences proximal (−1 kb to + 200 bp) to the 5′-ends of the mapped oligo-capped cDNAs were retrieved as PPRs. PPR region was defined as − 1 kb to + 200 bp, because, in many cases, TSSs are distributed over ∼100 bp wide and there are usually many TSSs located downstream of the representative TSS12 (also see Supplementary Fig. 1B). In order to cover most of those fluctuating TSSs, PCR primers were set using PRIMER3 between + 100 to + 200 bp. As a result, many of the PPR clones came to contain so-called upstream ATGs. For detailed discussion on the possible influences of those ATGs, see Supplementary Information Fig. 8. For details of the PPR sequences and the designed PCR primers, see Supplementary Tables 1–3 and 5.For prediction of the TATA boxes,9 a matrix search program, MATCH, was run using the position weight matrices of V$TATA_C (http://www.gene-regulation.com/cgi-bin/pub/databases/transfac/getTF.cgi?AC=M00216) and V$TATA_01 (http://www.gene-regulation.com/cgi-bin/pub/databases/transfac/getTF.cgi?AC=M00252) as for the TRANSFAC7.2 database. Hits observed between − 90 and + 27 relative to the TSSs in the plus strands with cut-off value of 0.77 were scored as positives. For the statistical test, Wilcoxon test was used.2.2. Cloning of the DNA fragments of PPRs and luciferase reporter gene assaysUsing the PCR primers designed for randomly selected 1000 PPRs (out of 2170 PPRs which were identified to be active in HEK293 cells; see Supplementary Fig. 1), 50 ng of human genomic DNA (Clontech) was amplified by PCR with 10 pmol of the 5′- and 3′-PCR primers and with the 35 reaction cycles of 94°C, 1 min; 58°C, 1 min; 68°C, 2 min; using a KOD Plus PCR kit (ToYoBo). For cloning the random genomic DNAs, the human genomic DNA was amplified by a similar procedure using PCR primers solely containing attB1 and attB2 sites with the following relaxed PCR conditions: 20 reaction cycles of 94°C, 1 min; 40°C, 1 min; 72°C, 1 min; using a ExTaq PCR kit (TaKaRa). The amplified fragments were size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and fragments of 1.0–1.2 kb were recovered. After the amplified fragments' lengths were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, PPR and random genomic DNA fragments were cloned into a luciferase reporter gene construct using the Gateway System (Invitrogen; http://www.invitrogen.com/content.cfm?pageid=4072). We employed this multi-faceted cloning system, so that the obtained promoter clones could be used in other vector systems in future experiments. For Gateway cloning, we performed ‘one-tube reactions’ according to the supplied instructions. The insert sequences were determined from both ends.As for ‘random’ genomic sequences, we checked their genomic positions using UCSC Genome Browser and found no explicit bias (Supplementary Table 2). We also found no difference in the distribution patterns of the G + C contents between the clones ‘random’ genomic fragments and computationally ‘randomly’-extracted genomic sequences (also see Supplementary Fig. 7). Although it is still possible that undetected bias might have been introduced by PCR amplifications, we considered the obtained clone set mostly represented ‘random’ genomic sequences.For transient transfection of the promoter clones, the DNAs were purified using QIAwell 96 Ultra (QIAGEN). HEK293 cells were cultured in 96-well micro-titre plates with a cell density of 1.0 × 104 per well. For each well, 50 ng of the promoter clones together with the 5 ng of pTK-Renilla were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using 0.3 µl of Fugene6 (Roche). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, dual luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The above procedures were repeated three times as independent cell culture and transfection experiments. For 86% of the data from 472 PPRs and 251 random fragments, estimated signal versus experimental noise (averaged luciferase activity versus the standard deviation of them calculated from the three experiments) ratio was less than 0.25. Identification, physical cloning, and luciferase assays of the PPRs of the ncRNAs were performed similarly with the cases of the PPRs.3. Results and discussion3.1. Luciferase assays of the DNA fragments corresponding to PPRsIn order to understand the overview of the promoter activities of primary DNA sequences in the human genome in a particular cell, we attempted to collect DNA fragments of PPRs which are active in HEK293 cells. For this purpose, we first collected the TSS information of the genes expressed in HEK293 cells by sequencing a 5′-end-enriched cDNA library constructed using our oligo-capping method10 (schematic representation of the workflow is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A). The overall full-lengthness of the cDNA library was estimated to be 85% (Supplementary Fig. 2). By mapping 12504 5′-ends cDNA sequences (Genbank accessions: BP870448–BP873619; BP244227–BP249739), we identified positional information of the PPRs, which are expressed in this cell line. The genomic DNAs corresponding to − 1 kb to + 200 bp were amplified by PCR and 472 PPRs were physically cloned into the luciferase vector (for examples, see Supplementary Figs 1B and C). In the present study, we focused on − 1 kb to + 200 bp regions as PPRs (82% of the previously characterized regulatory elements were shown to be located within this range; see Supplementary Fig. 3).We did not take the distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers and locus control regions, into consideration. Also, we did not assess the effects of chromatin structure or epigenetic modulations.8 Actually, in the reporter gene assays used in this study, influences of such factors are not reflected in exchange for its advantages in high throughput and quantitativeness. Intensive analysis focused on each gene would be indispensable for those purposes. Rather, we considered it should be prioritized to characterize the promoter activities intrinsic to the naked primary DNA sequences of the very adjacent or overlapping regions of the TSSs, providing actual docking platforms of transcriptional machineries. (In this issue, extensive analysis, comparing the activities of primary DNAs of PPRs observed using luciferase assays and the eventual mRNA expression levels observed using SAGE and microarray, is also presented in Supplementary Fig. 4.)Using the 472 successfully cloned PPRs, luciferase assays were systematically carried out under standardized cell culture conditions (Fig. 1). The assay was repeated at least three times for each of the PPRs (for raw data, see Supplementary Tables 1–3). We further selected 445 PPRs that were supported by more than three independently isolated oligo-cap cDNAs. This was done to assure that the frequency of the erroneously identified PPRs due to errors of the oligo-capping would be minimized (see in what follows). For the later analyses, we used the 472 PPR data set. Essentially, the same results were obtained using the selected 445 PPR data set (Fig. 1D; for the results of each of the following analyses, see Supplementary Fig. 5).Luciferase activities of the PPRs.

Two separate populations of PPRsAs shown in Fig. 1C, the observed promoter activities seemed to show a bimodal pattern of distribution. When we separated the PPRs with the luciferase activities of > 100.8 fold as P1 and those with < 100.8 fold as P2 (Table 1), we found that the bimodality of the distribution was statistically significant (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, sequence characterization of the PPRs revealed that there was a qualitative difference between the sequence features of P1 and P2 (Table 2).Luciferase activities and the classification of the PPRsStatistical significances of the marked positions are shown in the margin.Luciferase activities and the classification of the PPRsStatistical significances of the marked positions are shown in the margin.Sequence features of the PPRs and genomic fragmentsSequence features of the PPRs and genomic fragmentsFor P1, the frequencies of strict TATA boxes (TATA[T/A][T/A]), less-strict TATA boxes (TATA-like elements; hits from the matrix search with relaxed parameters: see Material and methods) and CpG-islands were 7, 20, and 63%, respectively. The overall G + C content was 0.54, which is far more GC-rich than the average G + C content of the entire human genome (0.45). This is in good agreement with our previous statistical analysis of PPRs.13 Also, within P1, the presence of the strict TATA-containing PPRs was enriched in the PPRs whose promoter activities were in the top 25% compared with those whose activities were in the bottom 25% (18 and 3%, respectively; P < 0.001). Generally, the sequence features of P1 were consistent with the previous view that the promoters are embedded in a relatively G + C rich sequence context, often associated with CpG islands, and the view that because the presence of the canonical TATA box provides the optimal docking platform for RNA polymerase II, it drives the strongest promoter activity.8 It should be the next step analysis to further narrow down the observed promoter activities are realized by what range of the DNA sequences within the PPRs.In contrast, P2 was far more AT-rich (G + C content = 0.47) than P1 (P < 6.0 × 10−10; also see Supplementary Table 6). CpG islands were far less frequent in P2 (13%; P < 1.0 × 10−6). Although the frequency of strict TATA boxes in P2 was similar to that in P1 (7%), that of the less-strict TATA-boxes was much higher (36%; P < 1.0 × 10−2). These sequence features, distinct from those of P1, were somewhat different from the features included in the classical view of promoters. Relative enrichment of the less-strict TATA boxes may indicate that sequences favourable for the binding of TATA-binding protein might be indispensable for P2, whose members otherwise meet few of the requirements of promoters as conventionally understood. Actually, G + C contents of P2 containing strict TATA boxes were lower than those of P1 similarly containing strict TATA boxes (Fig. 2). Again, this result indicates that a TATA box embedded in a relatively G + C rich sequence should be necessary for realizing strong promoter activity.G + C content of the PPRs. Box plot chart of the G + C content of the indicated population of the PPRs is shown.G + C content of the PPRs. Box plot chart of the G + C content of the indicated population of the PPRs is shown.We considered it unlikely that P2 consisted predominantly of erroneously identified PPRs. First, the fidelity of the identified PPRs should have increased, as the number of supporting oligo-cap cDNAs increases. As shown in Fig. 1D, among 472 PPRs, 445 (including 47 of the PPRs belonging to P2) were supported by more than three independently isolated oligo-cap cDNAs. Also, when the PPRs with more than three supporting oligo-cap cDNAs were used for all of the analyses, essentially the same results were obtained (Supplementary Fig. 5). Secondly, even for the PPRs in P2, it was not the case that the promoter activities were not observed at all. Although weak, the activities of these PPRs were clearly higher than most of the promoter activities observed for randomly isolated genomic fragments (G2: see in what follows). Lastly, supporting evidences have been reported. Although their purpose was different from ours, Trinklein et al.14 also performed luciferase assays for 152 kinds of PPRs identified from full-length cDNAs in HEK293 cells. Their results also indicated similar bimodal patterns of the promoter activities. Moreover, Versteeg et al.15 reported that human genes with high expression levels tend to be located in GC-rich regions and genes with low expression levels tend to be located in AT-rich regions according to their genome-wide ‘human transcriptome mapping’ analysis, which could be interpreted as the features of P1- and P2-driven genes, respectively.3.3. Possible universal promoter activities of the DNA sequences in the human genomeWe then attempted to examine the promoter activities of average human genomic DNA fragments in contrast to the observed PPR activities. We randomly isolated 251 non-genic genomic fragments of approximately the same length and measured their promoter activities (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table 2; also see Material and methods). As shown in Fig. 1C, unexpectedly, we occasionally observed promoter activities comparable with those of P2. The subpopulation of the genomic fragments whose promoter activities were more than average of the P2 was designated as G1 and the others as G2. As shown in Table 2, the overall G + C content of the G1 was similar to that of P2, and CpG islands were not observed at all. Interestingly, the frequency of TATA boxes (both strict and less-strict) in G1 was the highest in all of the populations. It is possible that TATA-like sequences present among the relatively AT-rich genomic sequences may happen to possess the minimal capacity to provide a sufficient docking platform for the RNA polymerase II complex (including the TATA binding protein), allowing the corresponding genomic regions to serve as ‘pseudo-’ promoters. Among them, some might have been fixed as P2 as a result of the fact that the downstream sequences became subjected to functional constraints as genes during the course of evolution.3.4. Possible origin of a class of ‘ncRNAs’From the analyses of promoter activities of primary DNA sequences of PPRs and random genomic sequences, we unexpectedly observed that the randomly isolated genomic fragments occasionally resembled P2 PPRs and displayed some promoter activities. This observation led us to hypothesize that this type of promoter activity could explain the origin of a population of a novel class of transcripts, non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Recently, both human and mouse full-length cDNA projects have demonstrated that there is an unexpectedly large number of transcript species that are unlikely to encode any proteins. For example, our FLJ project isolated 768 human full-length cDNAs that should be categorized as ‘ncRNAs’. Similarly, the FANTOM project also identified 4280 mouse ‘ncRNAs’ (‘ncRNA core’).5,16,17 The biological significance of this emerging class of ‘ncRNAs’ is currently of great interest, especially for those which are sometimes called, ‘mRNA-like long ncRNAs’ or ‘Transcripts of Unknown Functions’18 (we simply call them as ‘ncRNA’ hereafter).We first compared those so-called ‘ncRNAs’ identified from human and mouse full-length cDNA projects with each other. We observed that they are very scarcely overlapping (4%) with any meaningful parameters.9 Since concerned that the coverage of the human/mouse cDNAs was still not adequate for a meaningful comparison, we tried to map the corresponding human/mouse cDNAs, including PPRs, against the genomes of the counter-organisms. Still, essentially in no case was a significant hit detected. Intriguingly, a recent study demonstrated that knockout mice with mega-base-scale deletions of the genomic regions, where hundreds of those putative ‘ncRNAs’ are harbored, showed no detectable phenotypic features.20 We considered, if some parts of the genomic DNA are occasionally transcribed due to the above-mentioned sporadic promoter activities, it would be natural that most of them are evolutionarily non-conserved, since such transcription events should be free from functional constraints, even though they drive deterministic transcriptions in a particular species.In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the promoter activities of the PPRs of the 88 ‘ncRNAs’ that had been identified from the most intensively annotated chromosomes, 20–22, by the FLJ cDNA project. We also confirmed that none of them have any significant homology with mouse ncRNAs. We first examined the gene expression of these ‘ncRNAs’ in HEK293 cells by semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis. Clear expression of 49 putative ‘ncRNAs’ was detected (Supplementary Table 5 and Fig. 6). Among them, we successfully cloned the PPRs of 35 ‘ncRNAs’. As shown in Fig. 1C, their promoter activities were within a similar range of the P2 or G1 groups. At the same time, the sequence features of the PPRs most resembled them (Table 3; for raw data, see Supplementary Table 3; also see Supplementary Table 6).Sequence features of the PPRs of ncRNAs and the orphan cDNAsSequence features of the PPRs of ncRNAs and the orphan cDNAsThese findings suggest the possibility that at least some of the ‘ncRNAs’ may be driven by non-genic G1-like promoter activities that are evolutionarily sporadically occurring. Assumed that 33/251 (G1; 13%) of the 1 kb of the genomic DNA could possess the promoter activities, there could be 4 × 105 such promoters in the 3.0 × 109 base of human genome. Also, in our 1.8 million one-pass cDNA sequences, 9377 clusters which were supported by three or more cDNAs were located well outside of the previously annotated protein-coding genes defined by RefSeqs (‘Orphan cDNAs’). At the one-pass sequence level, most of them seemed not to correspond to protein-coding transcripts. We also analyzed the sequence features of their PPRs (Table 3). Again, we found that the PPRs of this category also resemble the features of P2 or G1. This result also supported our hypothesis that current number of orphan TSSs might be originated from sporadic promoter activities described in the present study.4. ConclusionsIn this paper, we have described promoter activities intrinsic to primary DNA sequences for PPRs of protein coding genes, random genomic regions, and PPRs of putative ncRNAs. We thereby demonstrated that there are two types of promoter activites, which are represented by P1 and P2. We also showed that average genomic DNA sequence occasionally possesses P2-type promoter activities, which may explain the origin of ncRNAs as well. Recent studies also elucidates that the genes having multiple promoters (alternative promoters) are widespread in human and mouse genes.21–25 Sporadic promoter activities emerged in the internal part of genes might explain the origin of at least some of such massively discovered alternative promoters, too. The observations and hypothesis produced by this paper should provide important viewpoint to analyze the complex nature of the transcriptome of human genes.On the other hand, studies on alternative splicing have revealed that minor alternative splicing isoforms of transcripts tend not to be conserved between humans and mice, and it is thought that this non-conservation may possibly serve as an evolutionary reservoir for novel variants.26 Likewise, formation of ab initio promoters may take place relatively frequently among the repertory of the genomic sequences. The framework of the transcriptional modulation of human genes may have a more dynamic nature than previously thought.27 It is also possible that those sporadic promoter activities identified in the present study have been imposing an inherent problem for developing promoter prediction programs.28 Further integrative analyses of both the promoters and transcriptome of human genes will lead to a better understanding of the system architecture of the transcriptional network of human genes.We are thankful to E.

IntroductionThe neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), affecting about 1–2% of the human population older than 65 years.1 It is characterized by the clinical symptoms of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, postural instability, a positive response to the administration of l-DOPA, and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions in postmortem brains, Lewy Bodies.2 Despite its mostly sporadic onset and a high discordance rate in monozygotic twins,3 several human linkage studies had been initiated to determine susceptibility genes for this disease.4 In the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, 13 PD loci have been recorded: PARK1,5 PARK2,6–9 PARK3,10 PARK4,11,12 PARK5,13 PARK6,14,15 PARK7,16,17 PARK8,18 PARK9,19,20 PARK10,21 PARK11,22,23 PaRK12,23,24 and PARK13.25 Furthermore, genome-wide analyses of multiplex PD families provided evidence for linkage to regions on different chromosomes.21,22,24,26–29 The PARK loci are sometimes larger than 10 Mb and can contain hundreds of genes. In case of the genome-wide linkage studies for a complex, multifactorial disease such as PD, the regions with high LOD scores are rarely smaller than 20 cM.29 The differences among independent studies and the size of the suggested susceptibility regions make the searches for the underlying mutations irremediably a time-consuming process.For several PARK loci, the searches have been successful. Mutations in α-synuclein (PARK1 and PARK4), DJ-1 (PARK7), parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase) (PARK6), LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) (PARK8), UCHL1 (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal-hydrolase-L1) (PARK5), and ATP13A2 (ATPase type 13A2) (PARK9) have been identified.5,30–37 Other studies have revealed the cytoskeletal protein tau (MAPT)36,38 and the ligand-independent nuclear receptor NR4A230,39,40 (Nurr1) as susceptibility genes. Although the definite role in PD of many of these genes is still discussed and controversial (especially for NR4A2 and UCHL1) and the known mutations account for less than 10% of all PD cases, the investigation into the functions of the underlying genes has generated an insight into the fundamental disease pathogenesis. For example, α-synuclein and parkin turned out to be major protein components of Lewy bodies in sporadic PD.41 Mutations in parkin, UCHL1, and DJ-1 suggest that abnormal protein folding and protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system is an important factor in the etiology of the disease.42,43PINK1 may be involved in the phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins in response to cellular stress, thus protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction.35 Interestingly, mitochondria are also the site, where the known neurotoxins for DA neurons operate, suggesting that their malfunctioning could be a major contributor to PD pathogenesis.44Current or future searches for the underlying mutations in the remaining orphan Parkinson loci could be accelerated and widened to promoter regions and to haplotype variations, if the number of candidate genes is narrowed down by other criteria. At least seven out of the nine PD-associated genes are expressed by nigral DA neurons,45–50 with different expression levels and specificity. These are α-synuclein, NR4A2, parkin,46PINK1, tau, UCHL1, and LRRK1 (http://www.brain-map.org). For this reason, we propose expression (specific or non-specific) by mesDA neurons as a selection criterion to identify candidate genes in those PD loci where the underlying gene is still unknown (orphan). Such an approach does not make any presumption with respect to disease mechanisms. Conceptually, the same method was applied on five large PD loci using serial analysis of gene expression for a comparative expression analysis of SNpc and adjacent mesencephalon in postmortem brains.51 As cell-specific expression in mouse and human is very similar, we took three murine expression studies which employed fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) and two unrelated subtractive methods for the identification of genes expressed by mesDA neurons.52–54 We collected the cDNA sequences of these expression analyses from public databases, determined the underlying genes and the corresponding gene ontology annotations [Gene Ontology (GO)] to obtain insight into their function. Then, we established their genetic locations and their syntenic positions on the human genome. Finally, we combined these data with existing human PD linkage studies.5–11,13–24,26–29,55,562. Material and methods2.1. Transcriptome analysisAll nucleotide sequences used in this study are publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide and derived from three expression analyses in mouse: (i) Barrett et al.52 published 779 sequences (Accession Nos.: BE824469–BE824504, BE824506–BE824519, BE824521–BE824561, BE824563–BE824823, BE824825–BE825045, BE825047–BE825132, CK338036–CK338155). (ii) Stewart et al.53,57,58 published 496 cDNA sequences (Accession Nos.: AA008736, W33210–W33212, W33214–W33289, W35421–W35480, W36130–W36269, W39787–W40005, W40007–W40008, W40010–W40023, W45732). (iii) We published 160 sequences (Accession Nos.: CO436137–CO436293).54Each nucleotide sequence was employed for a nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn) (basic local alignment search tool) on the nr database (non-redundant) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and on the mouse genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/MmBlast.html). We then recorded those alignments with the highest scores, the lowest e-values, and highest number of hits in a single locus. BLAST results were categorized into four groups: (1) no significant alignments on mouse genome (None), (2) significant alignments with mitochondrial DNA (Mitochondrial Genes), (3) multiple high-scoring alignments on mouse genome (Multiple Hits) for ambiguous results, and (4) significant alignments on mouse genome for single hits or otherwise unambiguous results (Table 1). The latter group was further subdivided into: ‘Genes’, ‘ESTs’, and ‘genomic Sequences’. The group ‘Genes’ comprises the results with high-scoring alignments in exons of single genes. In some cases, where the alignment lay in the region after the last exon or, according to the chromosome map view, in an intron of a given gene, we termed it also ‘Gene’, if the hit was in a UniGene cluster which was linked to the gene in the locus. With those alignments that we were unable to associate to a gene, we performed a blastn on the MmEST database. If we could associate the sequence to a previously described EST, we termed it ‘EST’; otherwise, it was termed ‘Genomic Sequence’.BLAST results on mouse genomecDNA sequences are separated into four different categories based on the types of alignments generated. Alignments on the mouse genome were subdivided into Genes, ESTs, and genomic sequences. For the category ‘Genes’, we differentiated further between ‘annotated’ and ‘hypothetical’ depending on the gene RefSeq status recorded at NCBI.72BLAST results on mouse genomecDNA sequences are separated into four different categories based on the types of alignments generated. Alignments on the mouse genome were subdivided into Genes, ESTs, and genomic sequences. For the category ‘Genes’, we differentiated further between ‘annotated’ and ‘hypothetical’ depending on the gene RefSeq status recorded at NCBI.72For all the ‘Annotated Genes’, ‘Hypothetical Genes’, and mitochondrial genes, the following data were collected from the locus link feature (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink this was replaced by http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene during the course of this study): the gene name, gene symbol, accession number, Gene ID, and the MGI link number, if available. The latter provides a relational link to the GO library and the information related to ‘biological processes’, ‘cellular components’, and ‘molecular functions’.For all cDNA sequences categorized by ‘Significant Alignments on Mouse Genome’, we also registered the exact chromosomal position in kilobases (starting from the top of the short arm).2.2. Mapping the murine cDNA sequences to the human genomeFor most of the murine genes, a human homolog has already been determined, normally carrying the same name and symbol. This information is registered on the Entrez Gene page together with the cytogenetic locations. When this information did not exist, we used the mouse protein sequence of the identified gene for a translated BLAST (tblastn), or the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment or the GenBank accession number of the corresponding gene for a blastn on the human genome. We registered the position in kilobases on the chromosome and verified each position on the human genome by comparing the neighboring genes to those in the mouse genome and recorded the human position only if the neighboring genes also matched.When the cytogenetic position on the human genome was determined, we compared this information with the positions of the recorded PARK loci. We aligned the human chromosome map view with the map for ‘morbid/disease’, described in OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM). When the genes, or the estimated human locations, and the cytogenetic disease locations co-localized, we called the gene a PD candidate gene. For the loci suggested by genome-wide studies, we selected those genes, which were situated ± 3 Mb from the chromosome marker (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)) with the highest LOD score (Table. 5). We are aware that this approach reduces the numbers of genes in an arbitrary manner. However, if preferred, the range can be widened with the provided data (see Supplementary Data) in order to more accurately consider asymmetry or size of each specific linkage peak.The entire data set was collected and processed using the database program, Filemaker Pro 7.0. The latest update was in February 2007. This database is available upon request.3. ResultsWe obtained 1435 sequences from three independent studies, which had the original aim to identify genes expressed by mesDA neurons. Barrett et al.52 had isolated DA neurons from E13 ventral midbrain by FACS. This library contains genes expressed by mesDA neurons with a preference for abundant genes. The other two studies used subtractive methods to enrich for rare RNA transcripts expressed by mesDA neurons. Stewart et al.53,57,58 had created a single-stranded directional cDNA library from substantia nigra of 8-week-old mice subtracted with a cDNA library from cerebellum. We had used a PCR-based differential display method54 employing cDNA from engrailed-1/2 double-mutant and wild-type ventral midbrain during the embryonic stages when mesDA neurons disappear in the mutants.59,60 The amplified sequences were compared to the expression profile of adult olfactory bulb, a source of DA neurons unrelated to those in the ventral midbrain. Only differentially expressed cDNA fragments were isolated and sequenced. As the original sequence analyses of the former two studies had been performed when a smaller nucleotide data set was available and in order to update our own expression analysis, we subjected the sequence data from all three screens to new BLAST searches and determined their association to genes and published ESTs, and their location on the mouse genome. The 1435 cDNA fragments generated 1050 unambiguous murine genomic hits, 19 ambiguous multiple hits, and 104 alignments with mitochondrial DNA. Two hundred and sixty-two cDNA sequences produced no significant alignments (see Table 1 for definitions and the entire analysis, and Table 2 for the individual libraries).Classification of BLAST results from each libraryaAnnotated mouse genes.bHypothetical genes determined by EST clustering or predicted by automated computational genome analysis with a large open reading frame.cExpressed sequencing tags.dUnderlying gene not identifiable, due to multiple alignments with low e-values.eNo hit in mouse and human genome.fNumber of unique alignments.

Most of them aligned to exons of those genes (72.6%; 741 of 1020). Out these 1020 cDNA fragments, 181 (17.8%) lay 3′ to the last annotated exon, suggesting that substantial amounts of mRNAs isolated from brain tissue are longer at their 3′ end than mRNAs from other tissues (Table 3). Finally, 9.6% (98 of 1020) of the alignments lay in regions designated as introns, suggesting that they are parts of unrecorded splice variants, possibly specific for mesDA neurons.Alignments in relation to gene lociGenomic alignments were divided into three groups: ‘ESTs’ (3.7%), ‘genomic sequences’ (6.0%), and ‘genes’ (90.3%). Majority of the cDNA fragments that aligned with genes are aligned with the last exon. A significant number of the cDNAs aligned with the region 3′ to the last exon.

See Material and Methods for details.aForty-four hits are in genes with only one exon.The 1050 cDNA fragments represented 503 genes (423 annotated and 80 hypothetical genes), 32 ESTs, and 44 unique genomic hits with no otherwise described ESTs. Additionally, the 104 sequences that aligned to the mitochondrial DNA represented 11 mitochondrial genes (Table 2). To these cDNA sequences, we associated the corresponding MGI numbers, if available. This provided us with insight into their molecular function, the cellular locations of the proteins, and the associated biological process (see Supplementary Data for the entire transcriptome analysis). Several protein classes were over-represented, like, for example, those, which take part in mitochondria-related processes, in fatty acid chain metabolism, in ubiquitination, in the MAPK signaling pathways, or which are chaperones. Some of these molecular pathways were previously linked to the death of mesDA neurons, to PD, and other human neurodegenerative disorders.The majority of the mutations, which are associated to PD, is in genes that are expressed in mesDA neurons. We, therefore, joined these expression analyses with human PD linkage and association studies,5–11,13–24,26–29,55,56 where no mutation has been associated thus far. For each unique mouse cDNA sequencing tag, we determined its human homolog and the corresponding cytogenetic and physical positions on the human chromosomes. We verified each locus on the human genome by identifying the neighboring genes on the mouse genome and recorded the human position only if the adjacent genes were the same. We then determined whether these positions were within OMIM (Table 4) and other suggestive (non-OMIM) PD loci (Table 5). In case of the OMIM orphan PD loci, we projected on the human chromosome view the map for ‘morbid diseases’. In case of non-OMIM loci, we identified the genes ± 3 Mb to the SNP marker with the highest LOD score. Totally, we linked the mouse transcriptome analyses to 569 unique locations on the human genome. Nineteen of these are within orphan PARK loci (Table 6) and 51 in non-OMIM PD loci (Table 7).PARK lociGenomic location of PARK loci as recorded in the OMIM databank. For seven of the PARK loci, the mutated genes were identified. The number of genes is the current GenBank estimation of all annotated and predicted genes in the corresponding PARK locus. For the PARK10 locus, we used the narrow definition 1p33-1p32.2 as determined by the two genetic markers D1S2134 and D1S200, and not the entire shorter arm of chromosome 1 (1p) which contains 1232 genes.21PARK lociGenomic location of PARK loci as recorded in the OMIM databank.

In these studies, the peak positions and the flanking genetic markers were given in centiMorgan on the Marshfield genetic map. We determined, when possible, the exact position in Mb on the corresponding chromosome. The average distance between the two adjacent genetic markers in each study varied between 5 and 11 cM.Association studies not recorded at OMIMFor each individual study, the highest LOD scores with the associated genetic markers are listed.

Our analysis confirmed the complementary nature of the three screens. Only 7.2% (104 out of 1435) of the cDNA sequences of these libraries represent genes, hypothetical genes, or EST clusters, which are found in more than one of them (Table 8). Moreover, the libraries also contained two cDNA fragments for α-synuclein, three for NR4A2, and one for the tau genes. Mutations in all three genes have been previously associated to PD.5,30,36 Assuming that all 30 000 genes in the human genome61 were equally likely detected, the probability to identify three of nine PD susceptibility genes by chance out of a pool of 569 was less than 3.4 × 10 −3. If we exclude the controversial NR4A2 and UCHL1, the probability was less than 1.5 × 10−2.cDNA library comparisonOf 1435, 104 (7.2%) cDNA fragments overlap with sequences also present in one other library. This number includes not only fragments that align with each other, but also those which align with the same annotated gene, hypothetical gene, mitochondrial gene, EST, or genomic position.

These overlapping 104 cDNA fragments represent 28 of 781 (3.6%) unique tags (Table 2).4. DiscussionThe entire human and mouse genome sequences have been available for more than 3 years.61,62 Therefore, the chromosomal locations of most genes have been determined and as a consequence also those genes within a given disease locus. In order to identify potential PD susceptibility genes, we projected the sequence data of three murine transcriptome studies for mesDA neurons onto the human genome and compared them with previously identified PD loci. We determine the human homologs of 1435 murine cDNA fragments which corresponded to 579 unique mouse chromosomal locations; 423 annotated genes, 80 hypothetical genes, 32 ESTs, and 44 genomic locations, which are not linked to any genes or otherwise reported cDNA sequences. Of the 569 unique locations on the human genome, 19 were positioned in OMIM PARK loci and 51 within genomic regions that have a weaker linkage to PD, which are not recorded in the OMIM database and need further confirmation.Multiple studies are on the way to determine the underlying mutations of orphan PARK loci63; however, the length of putative regulatory regions of most gene, their unpredictable position, and the common presence of SNPs have thus far restricted such studies to nucleotide variation in the coding region and in 5′ and 3′ UTR. Disparities in the promoter–enhancer–silencer regions were only the aim if the targeted gene had been previously linked to PD.64,65 A nucleotide variation in the α-synuclein promoter, for example, was associated to the disease.12,66 Variability on the level of gene expression is far more common than nucleotide variations which alter protein sequences67 and it is believed that these haplotype variations determine individual traits and predispositions for common diseases such as PD. Narrowing down the number of candidate genes in identified loci in a rational manner may encourage the inclusion of the promoter regions in future studies aiming to identify mutations associated to PD.Among the candidate genes that we found, the most interesting is VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporter 2) (10q25). Reduced expression of VMAT2 could be correlated with a higher sensitivity to environmental factors. For example, VMAT2 heterozygote mice (+/ − ) are remarkably more sensitive than wild-type to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.68,69 Furthermore, we identified two genes in the ubiquitination pathway, Ube2b [ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2B, RAD6 homology (S. cerevisiae)] and Ubb (Ubiquitin B, member of the HSP90 family) and Hspa5 (heat shock 70 kDa protein 5, member of the HSP70 family).Finally, 26 mitochondrial genes encoded by nuclear DNA are present in our transcriptome analysis. Of these, an unexpected high proportion of genes, namely four, are located within orphan OMIM PARK loci. There is increasing evidence that impairment of mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress are contributing factors to PD70 supported by the recent finding of a mutation in PINK1.35 Furthermore, the functional deficiencies induced by several of the other PD mutations seem to converge onto the mitochondria.71 Our finding confirms a central role of the mitochondria in PD and suggests the possibility that a misregulation of some of these four mitochondrial genes may be a contributing factor for the disease.We conclude that our transcriptome analysis, along with being applicable for the identification of PD candidate genes, may also be a useful tool for future genome-wide association studies with newer resources, such as HapMap (http://www.hapmap.org/), where tagSNPs can be chosen close to loci of genes expressed by mesDA neurons. Furthermore, new GO annotations are constantly added and with time it may turn out that many of the identified genes are part of shared metabolic pathways. Our data set may give new insight into ligand/receptor interactions and/or intracellular signaling pathways acting in mesDA neurons, allowing novel studies into the molecular etiology of PD.This work was supported by a grant from the German Federal Secretary for Education and Research (BMBF) Biofuture 98.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe last decade has been a remarkable time in the field of genome science. DNA sequences from over 2400 species have been determined,1 and more are on the way. Correspondingly, the need for reliable functional annotation has become prominent. Most functional annotation is based on a sequence similarity approach,2 but about half of the proteins registered in protein databases are classified as hypothetical because they lack similarity to functionally known proteins. Proteome-wide functional classification using bioinformatics approaches is becoming an important method for revealing unknown protein functions. For example, the recent exponential growth in Protein Data Bank entries has enabled highly accurate functional predictions to be made on the basis of structural similarities to three-dimensional profiles of proteins.3,4 Comparative genome analysis using phylogenetic profiling has revealed a diversity of functional linkages among genes, and thus it can be a useful strategy for elucidating the functions of uncharacterized proteins.5 However, although species-specific genes (ORFans) are known to encode many uncharacterized short peptides,6 the functions of these peptides are difficult to predict with certainty using comparative genomics because they lack homology to those sequences currently in databases. More than 23 000 ORFans have been found in 60 microbial genomes, and, on the basis of structural studies, many are likely to encode expressed, functional, or even essential proteins.7 Therefore, alternative bioinformatics methods that can predict these uncharacterized protein functions at the proteome level are very useful.For the past few years, we have been working on RNA metabolism in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus8–10 and reported on our experimental system in which an expression cloning method is used for extracting DNA/RNA-binding proteins at the proteome level. During this work, we observed that charged amino acids—such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, and lysine—appeared both in the sequence of the novel RNA-binding protein FAU-1 and Ribonuclease E in a periodic manner.8 It is possible that certain acidic and basic amino acid periodicities might affect the secondary or tertiary structure of a protein so that it gains DNA/RNA-binding activities. Amino acid periodicities are commonly observed features in the sequences of various proteins such as myosin and amyloids,11 serine–threonine, and tyrosine protein kinases12 and are known to be strongly correlated with their secondary structures.The purpose of the current study was to demonstrate that a bioinformatics approach focusing on the periodicity in a protein's primary structure could be a suitable method for elucidating DNA/RNA-binding proteins. Previously, several support vector machine (SVM)-based methods were developed towards predicting DNA-binding and RNA-binding proteins on the basis of various amino acid profiles (i.e. overall composition, pseudo-amino acid composition, surface composition, electrostatic potential, and hydrophobicity).13–16 SVM is one of the most powerful supervised learning algorithm that has recently widely been used in the field of bioinformatics. We describe here an SVM-based method for classifying known DNA/RNA-binding proteins from P. furiosus using amino acid composition and periodicity as feature vectors. The discriminant values (SVM output) derived from these profiles were defined as two new indices: composition (CO) score and periodicity (PD) score. Amino acid composition are known to be strongly correlated with protein secondary structure class17 and subcellular localization18,19 and are assumed to support the protein function classification. Therefore, on the basis of the two-dimensional correlation analysis, we combined amino acid composition (CO score) with the PD score to further improve the performance of DNA/RNA-binding protein prediction. The two-dimensional correlation analysis was then applied to hypothetical proteins of P. furiosus, and promising candidates for being novel DNA/RNA-binding proteins were selected. DNA/RNA-binding activities of these candidate proteins were examined experimentally and many of them were confirmed to possess DNA/RNA-binding activities.2. Materials and methods2.1. Protein data set and functional annotationsAutomated annotations and amino acid sequences of proteins from the two archaeal species, P. furiosus (2057 proteins) and Sulfolobus solfataricus (2934 proteins), were taken from the EMBL database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/; Release 83, June 2005). Each protein entry has a UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) accession code corresponding to its entry in either UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Swiss-Prot/; Release 47, May 2005) or UniProtKB/TrEMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/trembl/; Release 31, September 2005). Both databases contain information on the gene ontology annotation (GOA: a combination of electronic assignment and manual annotation), and protein data are from the domain databases InterPro20 and Pfam.21 Swiss-Prot data were used for the four prokaryotic and eukaryotic species—Bacillus subtilis (2799 proteins), Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 (4465 proteins), Arabidopsis thaliana (3454 proteins), and Caenorhabditis elegans (2655 proteins)—	as a reliable independent test set.We defined ‘functionally known proteins’ as functionally annotated proteins in the Swiss-Prot or TrEMBL databases with additional GOA. TrEMBL protein entries with no additional annotation were categorized as ‘putative functional proteins’. Proteins annotated as ‘hypothetical’ in the database were defined as ‘hypothetical proteins’. DNA/RNA-binding proteins were defined as those proteins whose annotations included the following keywords in Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and GOA annotations: DNA, RNA, ribosome(al), RNP, ribonucleo-, helicase, nuclease, or nucleic acid binding. To reduce the bias of functional variety in the protein data set, the functionally known proteins of the six model species were filtered to remove homologous proteins at sequence identity level with E-value < 1 × 10−4 and short peptides < 20 amino acids from future analyses. In total, we prepared 477 proteins of P. furiosus, 582 proteins of S. solfataricus, 914 of B. subtilis, 1436 of E. coli, 865 of A. thaliana, and 566 of C. elegans as a ‘representative set’ for the analysis (Table 1).Functional classification table of the proteome data set of six model speciesaRepresentative set consists of proteins with amino acid length > 20 and homology redacted using BLASTP (E-value < 1 × 10−4).Functional classification table of the proteome data set of six model speciesaRepresentative set consists of proteins with amino acid length > 20 and homology redacted using BLASTP (E-value < 1 × 10−4).2.2. Amino acid periodicityTo analyze amino acid periodicities, we used eight physico-chemical profiles (chemical, Sneath, Dayhoff, Stanfel, functional, charge, structural, and hydrophobicity)22 to subdivide the 20 common amino acids into groups. For example, the ‘charge’ profile divided the 20 amino acids into three groups: DE, RKH, and others (ACFGILMNPQSTVW). In total, 23 amino acid groups were identified: DE, RK, NQ, CM, ST, ILV, RKH, FYW, AGP, MNQ, CST, DEQN, FHWY, AGPST, GAVLIP, DERKH, CGNQSTY, ACGPSTWY, RNDQEHK, ILMFV, AFILMPVW, ACGILMPSTV, and CDEGHKNQRSTY.Amino acid periodicity was defined as the regular appearance of a certain amino acid group (X), Y (Y ≥ 3) times in a protein sequence with a period (the number of amino acids from one appearance to the next) of Z. Although a previous analysis in E. coli defined the range of periodicity as 2 to 50, to eliminate binal periodicities (ex: period 5 includes period 10), we used prime numbers and their multiples [2, 3, 5, 7, 8 (2 × 4), 9 (3 × 3), 11, 13, 15 (5 × 3), 17, 19]. To take into account the fluctuation of periodicities, we set the error range as ± 1. For example, in seq1 (XXXXAXXAXXXX), ‘A’ appears only twice, so no periodicity can be defined. Seq2 (XXBXXXXBXXXXBX) contains three ‘Bs’ with a period of five (‘B-5’ periodicity). Seq3 (XCXXXCXXCXXXCXXCX) contains five ‘Cs’ with multiple periodicities (two of length 3, two of length 4, and two of length 7). On the basis of the error range ± 1, length 4 is included in length 3; therefore, Seq3 is defined to have ‘C’ periods of only 3 and 7.2.3. SVM classification of DNA/RNA-binding proteins based on amino acid periodicity and compositionThese factors were applied as feature vectors and classified into two distinct members: DNA/RNA-binding proteins and proteins with other functions. For SVM training, the data label for DNA/RNA-binding proteins was denoted as 1 and proteins with other functions was denoted as −1. SVM analysis in this study was performed using the default parameters in Gist package version 2.3, which contains software tools for SVM classification.23 We have tested two types of kernel function (linear and radial basis) and selected the kernel function with higher prediction performance. As a consequence, maximum-margin hyperplane was applied to the protein test set on the basis of a radial basis function kernel (r = 1), and the discriminant value of each protein were defined as the PD score. Likewise, linear kernel-based maximum-margin hyperplane was applied for the protein set on the basis of amino acid composition, and discriminant values were defined as the CO score.2.4. Validation of PD score performanceThe performance of the PD score at predicting novel proteins was validated on the basis of 10-fold cross-validation test. The 10-fold cross-validation test is one of the most reliable methods for estimating the performance of the predictor. For example, the 477 representative data set of P. furiosus was randomly split into 10 mutually exclusive subsets D1, D2, … , D10 of approximately equal size. Each subset was tested on the basis of the training using the rest of the nine subsets. Estimated accuracies were derived as average values.2.5. Data fusion and threshold determinationTwo heterogeneous data set (amino acid periodicity and amino acid composition) were integrated by three different approaches (early, intermediate, and late integration).29 Early integration performs single SVM with a feature vector of 253 (periodicity) and 20 (composition) dimensions. For intermediate integration, kernel values (kernel matrix) are separately computed on each data type and the summed kernel values are used for the training of SVM. Late integration performs SVM separately and later, the discriminant values were summed (i.e. CO + PD score). Three evaluation indices, SE, SP, and ACC, were calculated for the evaluation of three different integration methods.2.6. Construction of expression vectors and purification of His-tagged recombinant proteinsGenomic DNA of P. furiosus DSM3638 was isolated using a GNOME kit (BIO101, La Jolla, CA, USA) and partially digested with the restriction enzyme Sau3AI. The resulting DNA fragments were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. Fragments of 15kb were extracted from the gel and used as templates for PCR cloning. After PCR amplification using site-specific primers (Supplementary Table S4) with NdeI and XhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, each of the candidate genes was cloned into the pET-23b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). Insert DNA was sequenced and shown to be identical to database sequences.Recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously.8 Briefly, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with each expression plasmid; however, optimal protein production required E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for the expression of PF0565 and PF1473 proteins and strain HMS174(DE3)pLysS for the expression of PF1498. Transformants were grown at 37°C in Luria–Bertani medium containing 50µg/mL ampicillin and supplemented with 0.4mM isopropylthio-b-galactoside. After 14–16h of further growth at 30°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000g for 10min at 4°C), and the recombinant proteins were released by sonication (2min) in buffer A (20mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 5mM imidazole, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40). The extracts were heat-treated at 85°C for 15min to destroy E. coli endogenous proteins and then centrifuged at 12000g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. The recombinant proteins were purified in an Ni2+–Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The peaks of the eluted proteins were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.02% Tween 20, 7mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol).2.7. Gel-shift assayHokkaido System Science Co. (Hokkaido, Japan) chemically synthesized 5′ end FAM-labeled oligonucleotides. Binding reactions containing the oligonucleotide (125 or 500nM) and 0.1–0.5µg of purified recombinant protein were incubated for 15min at either room temperature (24°C) or 75°C in 20µL of DNA/RNA-binding buffer (10mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 0.5mM EDTA, 2.5mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1mM dithiothreitol). The DNA/RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by 6% non-denaturing PAGE. The quantity of DNA/RNA-protein complexes was evaluated by scanning the fluorescent image with a computerized image analyzer, FX Pro (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). To sequence the oligonucleotides, we used the following two probes (Xiaojing et al., to be published separately): MPOR-27, 5′-r(GAAACAAGGAGAAAUGGUUCGUGUCCU)-3′,MPOD-27, 5′-d(GAAACAAGGAGAAATGGTTCGTGTCCT)-3′.3. Results and discussion3.1. Functional annotation of P. furiosus proteome and those of other model speciesP. furiosus, S. solfataricus, B. subtilis, E. coli, C. elegans, and A. thaliana were used as model species. The hyperthermophilic archaeon P. furiosus was chosen for its topical importance in the evolution of the ancient architecture of DNA/RNA regulation31 as well as for the thermal stability of its proteins, which enables easy generic purification. In addition, many P. furiosus protein functions remain unknown, which further justifies their study.From the EMBL database (Release 83, June 2005), we extracted reliable protein function data for P. furiosus (EMBL accession number AE009950) by unifying information from the three annotated databases Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and GOA.32,33 We defined the three categories of proteins on the basis of the number and quality of annotations (see Methods and materials section). For example, 2057 P. furiosus proteins were categorized into 942 functionally known proteins, 121 proteins with putative function, and 994 hypothetical proteins. To eliminate proteins with similar amino acid sequences, we performed a homology search among the 942 functionally known proteins using BLASTP (E-value < 1 × 10−4) and reduced the protein data set to 477 non-redundant proteins for the periodicity analysis. To facilitate their use as a training data set for SVM learning, these functionally known proteins were further divided into 157 DNA/RNA-binding proteins and 320 proteins with other functions. The same procedure was applied to the EMBL data of the archaeon S. solfataricus (EMBL accession number AE006641) and the Swiss-Prot entries of the B. subtilis, E. coli, A. thaliana, and C. elegans proteomes (Table 1).3.2. Amino acid periodicity score (PD score) and prediction of the DNA/RNA-binding proteinsTo ascertain common features of amino acid periodicity throughout the DNA/RNA-binding protein sequences, we defined 23 amino acid groups using eight physico-chemical profiles (chemical, Sneath, Dayhoff, Stanfel, functional, charge, structural, and hydrophobicity). We prepared a total of 253 patterns of amino acid periodicities (23 groups × 11 non-redundant periodicities). For each training data set in the six model species, the relative coverage of periodic region R was calculated for 253 individual amino acid periodicities as feature vectors for SVM input. Radial basis function SVM classification was performed with default parameters using the software Gist, which allows users to apply a sophisticated machine-learning algorithm to the data.23 To quantitatively evaluate a DNA/RNA-binding protein at the proteome level, the discriminant value derived by SVM was defined as a novel index, the periodicity score (PD score), and was assigned to the representative protein data set of each of the six model species.The performance of the PD score as a DNA/RNA-binding protein classifier was evaluated by applying the ROC curve to the representative set of P. furiosus proteins (Fig. 1). Sensitivity and specificity of the PD score overwhelmed that of various individual amino acids periodicities such as RK7, CDEGHKNQRSTY8, MNQ19, and AFILMPVW11. This demonstrated that a combination of amino acid periodicities as a feature vector optimizes the system for the classification of DNA/RNA-binding proteins.Performance of PD score. ROC curves of PD score (black) and single amino acid periodicities [RK7 (red), CDEGHKNQRSTY8 (blue), MNQ19 (green), and AFILMPVW11 (orange)]. For example, RK7 denotes the frequency of the periodic region of Arginine (R) and Lysine (K) appearing in the protein sequence with a periodicity of 7.Performance of PD score.

For example, RK7 denotes the frequency of the periodic region of Arginine (R) and Lysine (K) appearing in the protein sequence with a periodicity of 7.To further validate the performance of PD score, we conducted a comparative analysis upon amino acid composition and SVM-Prot.27 Amino acid composition is a widely used profile for predicting protein function, subcellular localization, and protein folding. We calculated 20 individual amino acid compositions as feature vectors for SVM input and defined a new indicator named as composition (CO) score. SVM-Prot is a general proteome-wide function-prediction software based on various features of primary sequences. Three indices, sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and overall accuracy (ACC), were calculated for the six model species, respectively, using 10-fold cross-validation to calculate the precise prediction efficiency (Table 2). The three predictors have shown different characteristics in predicting DNA/RNA-binding proteins owing to the three indices. The PD score possessed highest overall accuracy; CO score had the highest overall sensitivity and SVM-Prot had the highest overall specificity. As a result, the prediction performance of the PD score was comparable with other methods but statistical significances cannot be observed on the basis of the comparative analysis. Thus, we combined the two indicators CO score and PD score to improve our DNA/RNA-binding prediction method.Prediction performance of PD score compared with CO score and SVM-Prot in the six model speciesPredicted results are shown as SE (sensitivity) = TP/(TP + FN), SP (specificity) = TN/(TN + FP), and ACC (accuracy) = (TP + TN)/(TP + FN + TN + FP). Numbers in bold font indicate the highest index among the three classifiers.Prediction performance of PD score compared with CO score and SVM-Prot in the six model speciesPredicted results are shown as SE (sensitivity) = TP/(TP + FN), SP (specificity) = TN/(TN + FP), and ACC (accuracy) = (TP + TN)/(TP + FN + TN + FP). Numbers in bold font indicate the highest index among the three classifiers.3.3. Both CO score and PD score are required for efficient classification of DNA/RNA-binding protein predictionsFor the efficient classification of DNA/RNA-binding proteins, we performed three different methods (early integration, intermediate integration, and late integration) for integrating heterogeneous data sets on the basis of the context of SVM learning.29 Late integration has shown the best performance for sensitivity, whereas intermediate integration has shown the best performance for specificity and accuracy (data not shown). Our observation was not consistent with the previous work by Pavlidis,29 in which early and intermediate integrations have shown high performance compared with the late integration. It is possible that the prediction performance can be altered by many factors such as evaluation indices, data types, kernel function parameters, and feature-selection algorithms.To provide further insights into the relative performance of CO and PD scores and to extract efficient DNA/RNA-binding protein candidates, we have chosen the late integration method and carried out two-dimensional correlation analysis on the basis of CO score and PD score upon 477 functionally known proteins in P. furiosus. The correlation coefficient was r = 0.75 (all functionally known proteins) and r = 0.55 (DNA/RNA-binding proteins only), respectively. The 157 DNA/RNA-binding proteins located at the right-upper region of the two-dimensional plot, suggesting that both CO and PD scores are required for classifying proteins with DNA or RNA-binding activity (red and blue circles in Fig. 2A). Then two different thresholds were determined on the basis of this newly defined CO score + PD score. First threshold is based on the highest overall accuracy (ACC) with a CO + PD score of 0.6 and the second threshold is based on the highest MCC with CO + PD score = –0.13. According to the Supplementary Fig. S1, the first threshold optimizes the extraction of reliable candidates for novel DNA/RNA-binding proteins (SE = 52.2%, SP = 96.3%, ACC = 81.8%, and PPV = 87.2%) and the second threshold optimizes the classification performance of CO + PD score (SE = 82.2%, SP = 80%, ACC = 80.7%, and PPV = 66.8%). On the basis of these thresholds, we classified proteins into three classes (class I–III) (Fig. 2A). As a result, a total of 94 proteins including 82 DNA/RNA-binding proteins (Fig. 2B) were categorized as class I proteins (CO + PD score > 0.6).Two-dimensional correlation analysis of DNA/RNA-binding proteins in P. furiosus on the basis of amino acid composition and periodicity. (A) A total of 477 functionally known proteins in P. furiosus were plotted on the two-dimensional correlation plot of CO score and PD score. The ribosomal proteins (red), rest of the DNA/RNA-binding proteins (blue), and other functionally known proteins (black) are shown. The two dotted lines represent a threshold of maximum MCC value of 0.59 for optimizing sensitivity and specificity (black arrow) and a maximum ACC value of 81.8% for optimizing the prediction of DNA/RNA-binding protein candidates (white arrow). The ranges of three classes are Class I, CO + PD score > 0.6; class II, 0.6 > CO + PD score > –0.13; and class III –0.13 > CO + PD score.

(B) The numbers of ribosomal proteins (red), rest of the DNA/RNA-binding proteins (blue), and other functionally known proteins (black) are counted in classes I–III.Further observation of DNA/RNA-binding proteins has revealed a region-specific distribution of ribosomal proteins and other DNA/RNA-binding proteins. Ribosomal proteins are strongly affected by CO score and are dominant at the high range of CO score (CO > 0.5). The CO score of other DNA/RNA-binding proteins ranged between 0 and 0.5 but some of them were dominant at high PD score region (0.25–1.5). As shown in Supplementary Table S1, this region includes 13 tRNA-processing enzymes (i.e. tRNA-synthetases, CCA-adding enzymes, and RNase P subunits), 11 DNA-binding proteins (i.e. DNA polymerase, DNA helicase, DNA primase, and reverse gyrase), three ribosomal proteins (i.e. ribosomal protein S3P and ribosomal protein L14e), and various transcription/translation-related proteins (i.e. SRP54, HTH-type transcriptional regulator, and transcription termination–anti-termination factor). We assume that PD score is an effective means of classifying DNA/RNA-binding proteins from a set of proteins, which cannot be distinguished by using amino acid compositions.3.4. Selection and experimental verification of novel DNA/RNA-binding protein candidatesThe same procedure was applied to the 994 hypothetical proteins in P. furiosus. The two-dimensional plot of hypothetical proteins was similar to that of functionally known proteins as well as the protein ratio in classes I–III (Fig. 2 versus Fig. 3). However, the number of proteins has decreased from the high CO score (CO score > 0.5) region, which is known to be dominated by ribosomal proteins. As a result, 994 hypothetical proteins were classified into three classes (I–III) owing to the CO + PD score thresholds (Supplementary Table S2), and a total of 151 proteins were classified as strong candidates for novel DNA/RNA-binding proteins.Two-dimensional correlation analysis of hypothetical proteins in P. furiosus on the basis of amino acid composition and periodicity. (A) The vertical and horizontal axes represent CO and periodicity PD scores, respectively. Distribution of the 994 hypothetical proteins is shown. Experimentally validated 14 candidate proteins are denoted as red circles (possessed DNA/RNA-binding activity) and black circles (no detectable DNA/RNA-binding activity) and the remaining proteins are shown as green circles.

(B) The numbers of experimentally verified proteins with DNA/RNA-binding activities (red), protein with no DNA/RNA-binding activities (black), and the remaining hypothetical proteins (green) are counted for classes I–III.In order to verify that hypothetical proteins in class I actually possess DNA/RNA-binding protein activities, we randomly chose 17 hypothetical proteins from classes I–III (nine from class I, five from class II, and three from class III, Table 3). All 17 recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 4). To study the DNA/RNA-binding properties of the candidate proteins, we first carried out gel-shift assays using 5′ FAM-labeled, 27 bp, multipotential oligoprobe RNA (MPOR-27) (Fig. 5A). MPORs potentially possess four different secondary RNA structures (stem, bulge, loop, and single strand), which encompass the currently known structures corresponding to the activities of various RNA-binding proteins. The three proteins, PF0871, PF0678, and PF0840, aggregated in the loading well, so we removed them from the final results. A prominent shift of the RNA probe up the gel was observed in candidate proteins PF0029, PF0030, PF0565, PF1139, PF1473, PF1580, PF1912, and PF2062 (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the formation of certain nucleic acid–protein complexes appears to be temperature dependent. For example, PF1981 showed a significant shift at 75°C but not at 24°C (Fig. 5C versus 5B). PF0029, PF0030, PF1139, and PF1580 also showed binding affinity with the multipotential oligoprobe DNA, MPOD-27 (data not shown). No significant shifts were observed in PF0547, PF1142, PF1488, PF1498, or PF1913, though agarose gel analysis of purified PF1498 revealed it to be a potential protein–nucleic acid complex (Fig. 5D).Purification of the hypothetical proteins in P. furiosus.

According to our previous works,8,9 the systematic screening of P. furiosus genome using the expression cloning method has determined several DNA/RNA-binding proteins such as Thy-1 and FAU-1. Our system also demonstrated that approximately 10–20% of the P. furiosus gene products have shown to possess nucleic acid-binding activity. However, 80–90% of the P. furiosus gene products did not show any affinity to the nucleic acid in our gel-shift system. These results suggest that the 10 newly discovered proteins through the experimental procedure are good candidates as novel DNA/RNA-binding proteins, although their binding specificity remains unknown. The in vivo targets and precise biological functions of these proteins are to be further investigated.According to the domain assignment of the InterPro/Pfam domain database20,21 against P. furiosus proteome, 95–98% of the 942 functionally known proteins possessed domains related to those with known function (functional domains). On the other hand, for 994 hypothetical proteins, only 31–38% of the proteins possessed functional domains, 20% possessed domains of unknown function (DUF/UPF), and the remaining 43–50% lacked domain annotation (Supplementary Fig. S2). According to Supplementary Table 3, among the newly discovered 10 DNA/RNA-binding proteins, at least four ORFans are detected (PF0029, PF0030, PF0565, and PF1981), which completely lacked sequence similarity (E-value > 0.1) compared with any of the Swiss-Prot protein entries. The remaining six proteins have shown sequential similarity to the uncharacterized proteins of nearest BLASTP hit (8.00e–07 > E-value > 0.0), which were conserved among Pyrococcus and Methanococcus, including two proteins (PF1473 and PF2062) with no Pfam domain annotation. Hence, we believe that the combination of CO score and PD score is a powerful indicator for predicting proteins with potential DNA/RNA-binding activities from the sequence-specific ORFans and a set of proteins having no obvious functional domains, although allowing that the sample size of validated proteins is still small.3.5. Possible explanation of charged amino acid periodicity with DNA/RNA-binding activitiesAs the amino acid composition within proteins varies among taxa,34 our method removes the need to allow for the evolutionary gain and loss of amino acids and increases the generalization capability of SVM training. Charged amino acids, especially basic amino acids, have previously been suggested as a key component of nucleic acid-binding activity; for example, arginine-rich regions of the Drosophila melanogaster suppressor of sable gene35 are thought to mediate specific RNA-binding activity. Similar features have been observed in the structural motifs of DNA/RNA-binding proteins that possess positive electrostatic potentials in the binding region.36 On the basis of electrostatic potential, negatively charged amino acids (DE) conflict with DNA/RNA-binding. However, recent work has revealed that negative peptide charges contribute significantly to the electrostatic free energy of positively charged peptides and affect RNA binding,37 suggesting the importance of not only basic regions but also, in some cases, acidic regions at the protein surface, for establishing DNA/RNA-binding functions. These results suggest that relative compositions of charged amino acids, especially basic amino acids, are very important for nucleic acid binding. In addition, our study has shown that certain class of DNA/RNA-binding proteins were efficiently classified by integrating amino acid periodicity with amino acid composition. Especially, charged amino acid periodicities have been observed throughout the protein sequence of various DNA/RNA-binding proteins, suggesting that not only amino acid compositions in the DNA/RNA-binding domain region but also the overall sequence feature of amino acid periodicity is useful for classifying DNA/RNA-binding proteins.To gain insight into the relationship between charged amino acid periodicities and DNA/RNA-binding activity, a schematic representation of charged amino acid groups that appear periodically in the amino acid sequence of various DNA/RNA-binding proteins is given in Supplementary Fig. S3. The three proteins, signal recognition particle of 54kDa subunit (SRP54), DNA primase, and HTH-type transcriptional regulator lrpA, were chosen as an example for their characteristic features of possessing low CO score (–0.03 < CO score < 0.22) but relatively high PD score (0.56 < PD score < 0.88). An amino acid periodicity of both positively and negatively charged amino acids with various periodicities were widely found through protein primary sequence. The amino acid residues creating the periodicity (oblong boxes in Supplementary Fig. S3) are often conserved in the three-dimensional structures of orthologous proteins. Periodic region also covers DNA/RNA-recognition motif known as M domains and helix-turn-helix and active site of DNA primase. Our current study has shown that overall periodic features of charged amino acids throughout the protein primary structure may affect the organization of the secondary structures or the net charge of the protein surface in the tertiary structure in certain class of DNA/RNA-binding proteins. Further detailed analysis of the relationship between DNA/RNA-binding capacity and specific amino acid periodicity will be an important task with the help of other bioinformatics approaches such as the use of DNA/RNA-binding site prediction software,38 a comparative genomics approach that predicts function on the basis of the comparison of various domains,39 and three-dimensional protein models.40In conclusion, we have presented a new method for predicting novel DNA/RNA-binding proteins at the proteome level by focusing on compositions and periodicities of amino acids with similar physico-chemical profiles (quantified as a novel index denoted as CO score and PD score). The two-dimensional correlation analysis of CO score and PD score effectively separated DNA/RNA-binding proteins from other functionally known proteins in P. furiosus as class I proteins. By applying the same method to the 994 hypothetical proteins, we extracted a list of 151 hypothetical proteins as novel DNA/RNA-binding protein candidates. Ten proteins with potential DNA/RNA-binding activities were determined experimentally, including four ORFans and two proteins with no domains. The two-dimensional correlation analysis of CO score and PD score is applicable to any organisms with complete genomic data. To conclude, our method is highly efficient for evaluating hypothetical proteins on the basis of DNA/RNA-binding function. The CO + PD scores can be further integrated with prediction results from various protein function predictors and annotation methods to validate uncharacterized proteins comprehensively. Further, the investigation of these newly discovered DNA/RNA-binding proteins might elucidate the role of undiscovered protein–DNA/RNA networks and the recognition of many non-conserved proteins throughout entire species.We thank Asako Sato (Keio University, Japan) for technical assistance with the gel-shift assay.

IntroductionLIM proteins have been named by the initials of the three first discovered LIM homeodomain proteins: LIN11, ISL1, and MEC3.1–3 In Eukaryotes, LIM proteins contain one or more LIM domains, which are, in some cases, associated with a protein kinase domain or a homeodomain. The LIM domain is a cysteine–histidine-rich, zinc-coordinating domain consisting of two zinc fingers repeated in tandem.4 It is conserved over a wide variety of species. The cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family in animals is a subclass of LIM proteins characterized by their two LIM domains, with the consensus sequence [C-X2-C-X16–23-H-X2-C]-X2-[C-X2-C-X16–21C-X2–3-(C/D/H)], that are both followed by a short glycine-rich repeat. The CRP family in vertebrates involves four proteins: CRP1, CRP2, CRP3/MLP, and TLP, which act as molecular adapters.5 Indeed, CRP1, CRP2, and CRP3 are able to bind α-actin and zyxin, two components of the cytoskeleton. Although the LIM domains from animal CRP proteins are structurally similar to the GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor,6 their DNA-binding activity is yet unproven and CRP may rather be involved in protein–protein interactions.The LIM protein family in plants is CRP-related proteins containing two LIM domains separated by a long inter-LIM domain. On the contrary to the animal CRP family, plant LIM proteins have a longer C-terminal domain and lack the glycine-rich region (GRR) following each LIM domain. For all plant LIM proteins, the two LIM domains of 52 residues have the following characteristic structure: [C-X2-C-X17-H-X2-C]-X2-[C-X2-C-X17-C-X2-H].7 The first gene encoding a LIM domain protein in plants has been named SF3. Later renamed HaPLIM1, SF3 expression was found specific to sunflower pollen.8,9 The LIM proteins from sunflower, tobacco, and Arabidopsis have been classified into four groups: PLIM1 and PLIM2 specifically expressed in pollen and WLIM1 and WLIM2 expressed in the whole plant.7 Like animal CRP, most plant LIM proteins are present in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus. This is the case for the sunflower protein HaWLIM1 that, for many different cell types, localizes either in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus, or in both.10 Moreover, in protoplasts, HaWLIM1 seems to be associated with cortical microtubules, and it is also observed in the nucleus during the interphase.11 As for CRP proteins, the tobacco NtWLIM1 binds F-actin and may be involved in actin cytoskeleton stability.12 The sunflower protein HaPLIM1 has been detected both in small cytoplasmic structures located in the microspores and in the cortical region of mature pollen grains, where it concentrates in the actin-enriched germination cones, suggesting its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.13 Although HaPLIM1 was never found in the nucleus of vegetative cells, it exhibits a non-specific DNA- and RNA-binding activity.14 Hence, the function of HaWLIM1 and HaPLIM1 in the transcriptional regulation remains unclear. In tobacco, NtLIM1 is clearly a transcription factor that binds to the PAL-box, a conserved motif present in the promoter of a number of genes from the phenylpropanoid pathway.15 Transgenic tobacco plants with a reduced NtLIM1 expression also present reduced lignin content and a decreased expression of PAL, 4CL, and CAD, three enzymes involved in the lignin biosynthesis. In poplar, the distribution of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in different wood tissues indicates a rather high expression of an LIM protein homologue in tension wood.16 Accordingly, microarray analyses also indicate a higher expression of some LIM transcription factor homologues in tension wood.17 Tension wood, formed on the upper side of bent stems, is enriched in cellulose due to the formation of a supplementary gelatinous layer.Our study focused on the plant LIM domain proteins containing only two LIM domains homologous to the animal CRP family. First, we finely describe, in this paper, the poplar LIM gene family. We determined the complete sequence of six cDNAs encoding LIM proteins and searched for LIM domain protein encoding genes in the Populus trichocarpa genome sequence. Secondly, we completed the inventory of the Arabidopsis and rice LIM gene family. To get a global overview of the plant LIM domain family, cDNAs and ESTs encoding LIM domain proteins have extensively been researched in plant sequence databases. Sequence analyses and phylogenetic studies revealed the structural diversity in plant LIM proteins. We named the genes coding for LIM domain proteins by following a nomenclature stemming from the phylogenetic analysis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Characterization of poplar LIM cDNA and gene sequencesThe transcripts similar to LIM domain proteins were searched by basic local alignment search tool (BlastN) within a collection of 10 062 ESTs obtained from Populus tremula × Populus alba (clone INRA #717-1-B4, Populus section) wood cDNA libraries.16 Among the LIM ESTs grouped in a same contig, we selected the longest cDNA clone and sequenced it. The entire cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the forward primer TriplexA and the reverse primer pTriplexB116 of the pTriplex vector (Clontech, Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). We further completed the forward and reverse sequencing with new primers specific to each PtaLIM gene (Pta stands for P. tremula × P. alba; Supplementary Table S1). The different PtLIM genes (Pt stands for P. trichocarpa, Tacamahaca section) were identified in the Populus genome database (http://www.genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html)18 by keyword search, using the InterPro LIM domain annotation (IPR001781) as a query, and using the six cDNAs from P. tremula × P. alba as query for BlastN searches. We selected only the proteins containing two LIM domains. The prediction of exon/intron splicing in P. trichocarpa LIM genes was verified by sequencing reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR fragments with specific primers against poplar LIM genes (see Supplementary Table S1). These fragments were produced after amplification of polyA RNA prepared from poplar wood samples.19 Finally, the poplar ESTs homologous to the various PtaLIM transcripts identified were also searched against the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and against the PopulusDB database (http://www.populus.db.umu.se), where cDNA libraries were built from P. tremula or P. tremula × Populus tremuloides (Populus section) samples.202.2. Database search for sequences coding for LIM domain proteinUntil August 2006, we have used several ways to search in multiple databases all plant LIM proteins containing only two LIM domains. First, known genes and full-length cDNAs encoding LIM domain proteins from sunflower, tobacco, and Arabidopsis were collected from the literature and GenBank database.7 Additional genes and full-length cDNA annotated as ‘LIM domain protein’, or ‘LIM transcription factor’ were found by keyword searches or using the InterPro LIM domain annotation (IPR001781) as a query. Alternatively, the poplar LIM protein sequences were used for BLAST (TBlastN and BlastP) searches at the GenBank non-redundant database. The genomic and cDNA sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa were obtained from the GenBank, TIGR plant genomic group (http://plantgenomics.tigr.org/), and TAIR (http://arabidopsis.org) databases. Finally, to get more sequences encoding LIM domain proteins, ESTs homologous to plant LIM domain proteins were searched by BlastN at the GenBank EST database. This process was repeated with each newly identified set of plant LIM genes until no further sequences with significant similarity were identified. For each gene, the longest EST was translated in all reading frames using the EMBOSS Transeq program at the EMBL–EBI, and only those carrying the entire coding sequence (CDS) and some part of 3′ and 5′ untranslated region (UTR) were chosen for further phylogenetic analyses. When EST sequences were too short or did not contain the entire CDS, a consensus sequence was deduced using the Bioedit software. Finally, the deduced amino acid sequences were verified for those carrying the entire two LIM domains using the PROSITE database (http://www.expasy.org/prosite). The selected ESTs with their consensus sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.3. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of LIM domain proteinsThe selected protein sequences were aligned using the ClustalW software package (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/)21 with minor adjustments. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the Phylogenetic Interference Package (PHYLIP) program, version 3.63 (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). Genetic distance matrices using protein polymorphism were calculated using PROTDIST software with the JTT amino acid substitution matrix as measure of distances.22 A phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the neighbor-joining method thanks to NEIGHBOR software.23 To estimate the statistical robustness of nodes, 1000 bootstrap samples were generated with SEQBOOT software, and the majority rule consensus tree was generated by CONSENSE software. The plant LIM family was also analyzed through a parsimonious method using the PROTPARS program with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Maximum likelihood analyses were performed using Phyml v2.4.124 with the JTT matrix and 100 bootstrap replicates. Maximum likelihood trees were generated with BIONJ, a modified neighbor-joining algorithm.25 Trees were viewed and edited with Tree View,26 and bootstrap values < 50% were not reported.Conserved motifs in LIM domain proteins were detected using the ClustalW alignment with few manual corrections, and the MEME program (http://www.meme.sdsc.edu/meme/meme.html).27 The aligned protein sequences were shaded using the Bioedit software with a threshold of 90% for identical residues and a BLOSUM62 matrix for shading similar residues. Isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (Mw) were predicted using the pI/Mw tool at expasy (http://www.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). PROSITE results were used to find putative ASN-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites.3. Results and discussion3.1. Survey and characterization of the LIM domain proteins in poplar, Arabidopsis and riceThe distribution of 10 062 poplar ESTs in different wood cDNA libraries16 revealed that a cDNA, named PtaGLIM1a (EF035035), homologous to the LIM protein SF38 was abundant in differentiating xylem from tension wood. Five other PtaLIM cDNAs present in this EST collection were found, and a complete sequence was determined for each. We named them PtaGLIM1b (EF035036), PtaWLIM2a (EF035040), PtaPLIM2a (EF035037), PtaWLIM1a (EF035038), and PtaWLIM1b (EF035039). All of the full-length cDNAs obtained contain an entire CDS, a 5′ and a 3′ UTR, and encode protein with two LIM domains (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1).Schematic diagram of the structure of the poplar LIM domain proteins.

The conserved LIM1 and LIM2 domains are indicated by gray boxes. Open boxes show the N-terminal, inter-LIM, and C-terminal domains. Arrows indicate the respective position of the four introns (I1–I4).We searched the P. trichocarpa genome sequence for all the gene models coding for LIM domain proteins. We excluded several gene models coding for proteins containing only one LIM domain linked to either a cytochrome P450 domain or an ubiquitin interaction motif and focused on gene models with two LIM domains. Besides the gene models corresponding to the six cDNAs isolated in our laboratory, we identified six other gene models encoding LIM domain proteins, raising to twelve the number of LIM gene models in the Populus genome. In accordance with their phylogenetic relationship with other known plant LIM domain proteins, we named these genes PtWLIM1a, PtWLIM1b, PtGLIM1a, PtGLIM1b, PtβLIM1a, PtβLIM1b, PtWLIM2a, PtWLIM2b, PtPLIM2a, PtPLIM2b, PtδLIM2a, and PtδLIM2b (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S3). With new information from both full-length PtaLIM cDNAs and P. trichocarpa transcript sequences,28 we have corrected and improved the annotated poplar genomic sequence for the PtLIM genes (Supplementary Data 1).Phylogenetic trees of P. trichocarpa, A. thaliana, and O. sativa LIM domain proteins.

This high similarity strongly suggests a gene duplication, as previously observed in a recent study for the poplar cellulose synthase CesA gene family.29 These observations are in accordance with the hypothesis that poplar is an ancient polyploid and that a large-scale duplication event has occurred in the ancestor of poplar.18,30 The duplicated LIM proteins may have kept similar functions, but the distribution of ESTs as well as the expression pattern between duplicated genes (data not shown) differs slightly, suggesting some other differences within their regulatory regions. All the deduced proteins have the features of the plant LIM domain protein family as described previously,7 with two LIM domains separated by a long-spacer named the inter-LIM region, a short N-ter domain, and a C-ter domain variable in length (Supplementary Fig. S1). The length of PtLIM proteins is rather constant, between 194 and 216 amino acids, and their Mw varies between 20.9 and 24.1 kDa (data not shown). Poplar LIM proteins share a level of homology ranging from 43 to 95% of amino acid identity (Supplementary Table S4). The highest divergence between poplar LIM protein sequences is mainly localized to the inter-LIM and C-ter domains. From the single analysis of amino acid identity between the different poplar LIM domain proteins, we differentiated these proteins into two major groups: LIM1 and LIM2. Within each group, the percentage of identity at the amino acid level is a lot higher (from 58 to 95%) than between the two groups (from 43 to 55%).A previous study reported the identification of three LIM genes in the A. thaliana genome: AtWLIM1 (At1g10200), AtPLIM2 (At2g45800), and AtWLIM2 (At2g39900).7 Because the sequences of both the Arabidopsis and rice genomes were publicly available, we had the opportunity to identify extensively all the genes coding for LIM domain proteins. Bioinformatics analyses performed against the GenBank and TIGR databases show that the Arabidopsis genome contains three other AtLIM genes. Because these genes seem to be duplicated, we named them AtPLIM2b (At1g01780), AtPLIM2c (At3g61230), and AtWLIM2b (At3g55770, also named AtL231), whereas the previous AtWLIM2 and AtPLIM2 genes have been renamed AtWLIM2a and AtPLIM2a, respectively (Fig. 2B). The Supplementary Table S5 lists genomic, cDNA, and EST accessions for the six Arabidopsis LIM genes, as well as the cDNA and genomic clones that contain errors or encode partial LIM domain proteins. It should be pointed out that the three related genes AtPLIM2a, b, and c overlap, respectively, with a gene encoding a phosphomannomutase (At2g45790), a gene encoding an unknown protein (At1g01770), and a gene encoding an oxydoreductase (At3g61220) that may affect the transcription of these AtPLIM2 genes.As in Arabidopsis, the rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains six genes coding for protein with two LIM domains: OsWLIM1 (LOC_Os12g32620), OsWLIM2 (LOC_Os03g15940), OsPLIM2a (LOC_Os02g42820), OsPLIM2b (LOC_Os04g45010), OsPLIM2c (LOC_Os10g35930), and OsLIM (LOC_Os06g13030) (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table S5). OsPLIM2a, b, and c are very similar in their sequences and, therefore, may be considered in-paralogs genes. Unlike poplar, duplication is not the rule in Arabidopsis and rice (Fig. 2D). The genes OsWLIM2, OsPLIM2b, and OsPLIM2c are well supported by ESTs and are represented by full-length cDNAs.32 For OsWLIM1, the identified cDNA (AK058220) is truncated. OsPLIM2a is also poorly represented at the mRNA level, with only two ESTs found and no published full-length cDNA. Therefore, for these two genes, we used their genomic sequences for the sequence alignment. In the case of OsLIM, we identified a very long transcript (AK102383) that encodes an unusual LIM protein of 1303 amino acids with two classical LIM domains and a very long C-ter domain that has no homology for any known protein. Only one (CI584223) of the 22 ESTs found by a BlastN search localizes in the 5′ part of the transcript at the level of the first LIM domain. Because of its unusually long C-ter domain, we did not include this LIM sequence in the phylogenetic analysis.From the genomic analysis, we can infer that all plant LIM genes have a core gene structure with four introns within the coding sequence with the exception of AtPLIM2a and c genes that have two and three introns, respectively (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2). The position of the first and last introns is strictly conserved in the first and second LIM domain, respectively. In poplar and Arabidopsis, the WLIM2 genes diverge from the other LIM genes by the occurrence of one (AtWLIM2a, PtWLIM2a, and b) or two (AtWLIM2b) supplementary introns in the 5′ UTR, before the ATG initiation codon. For these WLIM2 genes in eudicots species, a mechanism of alternative splicing of the first intron may be involved in post-translational regulation. This is supported by northern-blot experiments revealing two hybridizing bands for AtWLIM2b only in the shoot and not in the root.31The length of coding regions CR1, CR2, and CR4 is highly conserved between plant LIM genes, indicative of a strict conservation in the length of the LIM domains during evolution (Supplementary Fig. S2). The first coding region is 135–138 bp long and only OsWLIM1, OsWLIM2, and OsLIM have a variable CR1 length. The second coding region is 97 bp long for genes belonging to the LIM1 group and 100 bp long for genes from the LIM2 group. The fourth exon, localized within the second LIM domain, is the most conserved exon, with a length of 90 bp for all LIM genes. The CR3 and CR5 are highly variable in length resulting in the differences observed at the amino acid level, respectively, in the interLIM region and the C-ter domain. Finally, the PLIM2 and δLIM2 genes contain the longest fifth coding region that reflects the extensive length of the C-ter region of the deduced proteins.In a previous study, LIM proteins from sunflower, tobacco, and Arabidopsis have been classified into two groups, LIM1 and LIM2, and subdivided into four subgroups: PLIM1 and PLIM2, specifically expressed in pollen, and WLIM1 and WLIM2, widely expressed in plant.7 Because of the availability of the genome sequence for P. trichocarpa, A. thaliana, and O. sativa, we found an increased number of genes belonging to the plant LIM domain family. The newly discovered LIM proteins may define new LIM subgroups or be related to the previously identified subgroups. To approach the diversity of the LIM gene family, an extensive BlastN search of cDNAs and ESTs encoding proteins with two LIM domains has been performed in NCBI plant sequence databases. In plants, we found 165 unigenes homologous to LIM domain protein, but we did not include 49 of them in the phylogenetic analysis because they contained only partial CDS (data not shown). Within the 116 unigenes coding for an entire LIM domain protein, 90 have a representative EST containing a full length CDS, whereas for each of the remaining 26 unigenes, a consensus was built to determine the complete CDS (Supplementary Table S2). We identified ESTs from a wide range of species in the different groups of plants: bryophytes, conifers, piperales, monocotyledons, and eudicotyledons including rosids, asterids, caryophyllales, and banunculales subclasses. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and in the sunflower (Helianthus annuus), the number of different LIM transcripts has been raised to eight with the finding of novel ESTs, notably the HpWLIM2 EST from Helianthus petiolaris, whose existence was previously suspected in this genus by others.73.2. Phylogenetic analysis of plant LIM proteins with regard to expression dataPhylogenetic trees have been constructed with the deduced amino acid sequence of the genes encoding LIM domain proteins (Fig. 3). We renamed the plant LIM proteins according to their phylogenetic relationship. The LIM1 and LIM2 groups identified previously7 are clearly separated and supported by a high bootstrap value at the level of the TrLIM and PpLIM proteins from the mosses Physcomitrella patens and Tortula ruralis (Fig. 3). We were unable to place these two LIM proteins within either group because their sequence shares similarities with both LIM groups. Therefore, the phylogenetic trees have been rooted using sequences of these two Bryophyte LIM proteins. The plant LIM family can be divided into four groups, αLIM1, βLIM1, γLIM2, and δLIM2 resulting from the division of the LIM1 and LIM2 groups. These four groups are supported by high bootstrap values. This phylogenetic analysis confirms the existence of the PLIM1, WLIM1, PLIM2, and WLIM2 subgroups as described previously.7 βLIM1 is a new group that has not been identified before, whereas the αLIM1 group includes PLIM1 and WLIM1 subgroups. The WLIM2 and PLIM2 subgroups belong, respectively, to the γLIM2 and δLIM2 groups. In addition, each group contains new subgroups, which are described below.Phylogenetic tree of plant LIM domain proteins. Amino acid sequences of 149 LIM domain proteins were analyzed by neighbor-joining method with genetic distance calculated by the JTT model of amino acids change. The numbers at the nodes represent bootstraps values (≥500) based on 1000 replications. The lengths of the branches are proportional to the expected numbers of amino acid substitutions per site with a scale provided at the bottom of the tree.

With regards to the low bootstrap value supporting the node, the definition of these two subgroups remains questionable (Fig. 3). In contrast, the monocots WLIM1 subgroup clearly forms a statistically significant new monophyletic clade distinct from the eudicots WLIM1 subgroup. Additionally, a fourth subgroup FLIM1 could also be assigned to the αLIM1 group. However, the respective position of the PLIM1, FLIM1, and monocots and eudicots WLIM1 subgroups within the αLIM1 group needs to be clarified. Indeed, the neighbor-joining trees generated from a matrix of distances calculated by the JTT method or from the maximum likelihood (PhyML) method gave us an FLIM1 subgroup close to the eudicots and monocots WLIM1 subgroups and clearly separated from the PLIM1 subgroup (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S3). However, when using the parsimonious method, the FLIM1 subgroup takes place within the PLIM1 subgroup, between the PLIM1 proteins from the Solanaceae and the Asteraceae families (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, this last method favors the hypothesis of a common ancestor for the monocots WLIM1 and PLIM1 subgroups. Presently, the FLIM1 subgroup includes only a few proteins, namely PtGLIM1a and b, GhαLIM1, and EeαLIM1. Although additional sequences are definitely needed to strengthen this classification, there are strong arguments for the creation of a FLIM1 subgroup: (i) PtGLIM1a and b share 81% of amino acid identity with GhαLIM1 and 79% with EeαLIM1; (ii) RT–PCR analyses indicate that the PtGLIM1a and b genes are not expressed in pollen (data not shown), which could be an argument against grouping PtGLIM1a and b within the PLIM1 subgroup. With 58 ESTs coming mostly from different xylem cDNA libraries (Fig. 4), PtGLIM1a is probably highly expressed in xylem tissues and to a lesser extent in other organs with vascular tissues, such as leaves. In contrast to PtGLIM1a, PtGLIM1b ESTs are preferentially found in cambial zone and phloem. The PtGLIM1a and b names include a G, indicative of their abundance in tension wood with G-fibers.16,17 Similarly, all of the 31 GhαLIM1 ESTs were found in mature cotton fibers and a majority (29 ESTs) came from fibers harvested during secondary cell wall formation (Supplementary Table S2). Accordingly, we named this subgroup FLIM1 with the F, indicative of the high expression of its members in fibers. We can speculate that during the evolution of poplar and cotton species, these three proteins may have gained a novel function important for fiber differentiation or maturation and more particularly in fibers containing a cellulose-enriched secondary cell wall.Distribution of poplar LIM EST in different poplar cDNA libraries. (A) Libraries from INRA-Orléans.16 (B) Libraries from Umea Plant Science Centre (UPSC).20 (C) Libraries from University of British Columbia (UBC):28 cDNA libraries prepared from young and mature leaves, along with green shoot tips (PT-GT-FL-A-3), local mature leaves harvested after continuous feeding by M. disstria (PTxD-IL-N-A-9), outer xylem harvested biweekly between April and October 2002 (PT-DX-A-7 and PT-DX-N-A-10), phloem and cambium (PT-P-FL-A-2), bark (with phloem and cambium attached) harvested after continuous feeding by C. lapathi (PTxN-IB-N-A-11), roots harvested from 3-month-old trees grown in hydroponic media without nitrogen source for 24 and 48 h, as well as trees grown in regular media (PTxD-NR-A-8), cultured cells grown in media supplemented with salicylic acid, benzothiadazole, methyl jasmonate, chitosan, or Pollacia radiosa extract (PTxD-ICC-N-A-14); for more details, see Ralph et al.28Distribution of poplar LIM EST in different poplar cDNA libraries.

Many expression studies have demonstrated the pollen-specific expression of these PLIM1 genes. For example, the sunflower HaPLIM1a (SF3) is a protein exclusively and highly expressed in maturing pollen,13 and its colocalization with actin in the germinating cone suggests that HaPLIM1a participates in pollen germination or pollen tube elongation. The tobacco NtPLIM1a gene has also been shown to be highly expressed in mature pollen,33 whereas in Gerberea hybrida, the expression of GhPLIM1a gene is highly upregulated in stamens as evidenced in microarray studies.34 Likewise, the petunia PGPS/D1 gene encoding a PLIM1 protein has been found to be highly expressed in germinating pollen,35 and the accumulation of the PhPLIM1 transcript increases during anther maturation suggesting again an involvement of PLIM1 proteins in pollen tube elongation. PLIM1 proteins from Solanaceae species are clearly separated from those belonging to the Asteraceae species, suggesting that PLIM1 proteins have diverged during the speciation of these two families.The monocots WLIM1 subgroup contains proteins with high homology (from 89 to 99% of amino acid identity). Monocots WLIM1 ESTs originate from a large amount of tissue including inflorescences. Only the closely related SoWLIM1a and b genes from sugarcane seem to be duplicated, as the two maize WLIM1 transcripts described are probably alleles of the same gene. Surprisingly, a high number of WLIM1 ESTs has been sequenced from the maize (200) and sugarcane (128) cDNA libraries. In particular, SoWLIM1a and b with 76 ESTs is the biggest cluster of the ‘shoot-root transition zone from adult plant’ cDNA library.All plant species from core eudicotyledons are represented within the large eudicots WLIM1 subgroup. Within this subgroup, only poplar, Ipomoea, and soybean species have in-paralogs WLIM1 proteins (Fig. 3). In general, each plant WLIM1 gene is represented by a large number of ESTs originating from a wide variety of tissues, sometimes including inflorescence organs. The WLIM1 genes have been the most studied LIM genes in plants, but their precise function is yet to be defined. In the sunflower, the HaWLIM1 protein is localized in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm for different cell types,10 and may be associated with the tubulin cytoskeleton in protoplasts.11 A tobacco WLIM1 gene, NtLIM1, highly expressed in the stem, acts as a transcription activator. Indeed, the binding of the NtLIM1 protein to the PAL-box motif, present on the promoter of several genes from the lignin biosynthesis pathway, leads to the activation of the transcription of these genes. Moreover, an important reduction in the lignin content has been observed in antisense Ntlim1 transgenic tobacco.15 NtLIM1 protein mostly differs from NtWLIM1 protein7 by seven additional residues in the C-ter of the protein. The NtWLIM1 protein binds actin directly with a high affinity, enhances the stability of actin cytoskeleton, and promotes the bundling of actin filaments.12 The poplar ESTs homologous to PtWLIM1a and b are more represented in vascular tissues with many ESTs from phloem, cambium, and xylem (Fig. 4). In Eucalyptus globulus, the homologous EgLIM1 gene (AB208710) and the corresponding cDNA (AB208709) have also been isolated, but there is no expression information available. We have been unable to position the ShαLIM1, AfpαLIM1, VvαLIM1, and CsαLIM1 proteins in either subgroup of the αLIM1 group, as illustrated by the low bootstrap values supporting the nodes.In conifer trees, the LIM1 proteins are very similar in structure in white spruce (Picea glauca) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). For both species, the LIM1 proteins have undergone a probable duplication event, and it is difficult to class them into either the αLIM1 or the βLIM1 subgroup (Fig. 3). In Pinus taeda, the PitLIM1b (clone 6C12H) gene is more highly expressed in the xylem than in any other part of the tree.36 Therefore, at least in tree species, the LIM domain proteins from the WLIM1 subgroup, as well as those from the FLIM1 subgroup, are preferentially expressed during vascular development.The new βLIM1 group contains LIM proteins from species mostly belonging to the asterids and rosids subclasses, including the poplar duplicated PtβLIM1a and b proteins. Interestingly, there are no Arabidopsis or rice proteins into this group (Fig. 3). The proteins from Solanaceae and Asteraceae form two distinct smaller clades within this group. Within the asterids subclass, only the Solanaceae species (tobacco, potato, and tomato) have in-paralogs βLIM1 proteins. The expression or function of the βLIM1 genes is yet unknown. Like the genes from the WLIM1 and WLIM2 subgroups, βLIM1 ESTs originate from a variety of tissues including flower and fruit (data not shown), but they are preferentially found in roots, in cells that undergo differentiation like immature cotton fibers, and in undifferentiated cells like callus. In poplar, the PtβLIM1a ESTs almost exclusively originate from cell suspension cultures and the PtβLIM1b ESTs are more widely represented in xylem, vegetative buds, and roots (Fig. 4). Although βLIM1 ESTs originate from all parts of the plant, a significant number has been sequenced from undifferentiated cell samples.The γLIM2 group is clearly separated from the δLIM2 group with a high bootstrap value (Fig. 3). The γLIM2 group contains the monocots and eudicots WLIM2 subgroups that are clearly separated. As in the WLIM1 subgroup, the short branches are indicative of a high conservation between WLIM2 protein sequences within each subgroup. In several eudicots such as Arabidopsis, poplar, cotton, and lettuce, WLIM2 genes are duplicated, whereas this is never the case in monocot species. For both monocots and eudicots WLIM2 subgroups, a high number of ESTs from various tissues, including inflorescences, have been sequenced. This is the case in Arabidopsis for the AtWLIM2a gene7 as well as in poplar, for the PtWLIM2a and b genes (Fig. 4). The wide range of expression and the high conservation of WLIM2 genes suggest that they may be involved in basic cellular processes. This is substantiated by the difficulty to produce homozygous mutants for AtWLIM2a gene.37 In a recent microarray study, AtWLIM2a appeared highly expressed in siliques, and its expression was induced in the Arabidopsis pkl mutant.37 The PKL protein is a negative regulator of transcription that acts as a repressor of embryonic identity during seed germination, and AtWLIM2a gene may be involved in the regulation of embryo development. In another study, AtWLIM2a expression is also gradually induced during leaf senescence.38 Taken together, the AtWLIM2a gene may be more precisely involved in the seed maturation. The duplicate of AtWLIM2a, AtWLIM2b (AtL2), is more highly expressed in roots than in shoots. In addition, this expression seems to be affected by nitrogen availability.31Because of the increased number of LIM sequences available, the δLIM2 group is considerably enlarged. The δLIM2 group is divided into three monophyletic subgroups: the eudicots PLIM2, monocots PLIM2, and Asterids δLIM2 that contains the sequences from the new LIM domain proteins identified in sunflower and tobacco plants (Fig. 3). Several duplication events have occurred within the δLIM2 genes, indicative of an important diversification within this group. Because of the long length of branches, the δLIM2 proteins are on average more divergent each other than proteins from any other groups. Most eudicots PLIM2 genes appear preferentially expressed during pollen development. This is the case for AtPLIM2a expressed in hydrated pollen grains,39 for the tobacco NtPLIM2, and the sunflower HaPLIM2 genes.7 Likewise, in Gerbera hybrida, the ESTs encoding an homologue to HaPLIM2 also appeared exclusively expressed in stamens 34 and in tomato, all the EST sequences orthologous to the NtPLIM2 gene originated from a pollen cDNA library (data not shown). Surprisingly, a poplar cDNA library prepared from male catkins20 does not contain any PtPLIM2a and b EST, but we observed for the PtPLIM2a gene a strong expression in mature anthers (data not shown). It should be noted that a few PtPLIM2a ESTs originate from cambial zone, tension wood, and root poplar libraries (Fig. 4), but no PtPLIM2b EST has been sequenced yet.Monocots PLIM2 proteins are phylogenetically separated from eudicots PLIM2 proteins supported by a high bootstrap value. In monocots, the PLIM2 proteins are generally found in triplicate, resulting from at least two duplication events. Contrary to the highly conserved monocots WLIM2 proteins, monocots PLIM2 proteins are more divergent. As for eudicots, the monocots PLIM2 genes are generally highly expressed in pollen, but not exclusively. Of the 200 ZmPLIM2a ESTs found in public databases, 156 come from flower cDNA libraries, and 66 from these ESTs originate from mature pollen. The majority of OsPLIM2c and OsPLIM2b ESTs also come from flower cDNA libraries. OsPLIM2c (AK072520) expression has been studied using microarray analysis during pollination and early embryogenesis in the rice pistil.40 Their maximal accumulation in the pistil occurs at anthesis and decreases gradually during the following 24 h, when the pollen tube reaches the micropyle. However, the same study reveals a wider expression of the OsPLIM2c gene, suggesting an involvement in some other processes than pollen tube elongation. We speculate that within monocots and rosids species, the extensive duplication of their PLIM2 genes may be a counterpart to the lack of specialization of the genes from the αLIM1 group toward pollen-specific expression.In asterids species, LIM genes also seem duplicated within the δLIM2 group. Contrary to the Arabidopsis PLIM2 genes found in triplicate within the PLIM2 subgroup, the newly discovered tobacco and sunflower δLIM2 proteins are more distantly related from the previously identified HaPLIM2 and NtPLIM2 and therefore belong to a new Asterids δLIM2 subgroup (Fig. 3). The Asterids δLIM2 subgroup is surrounded by the two monocots and eudicots PLIM2 subgroups. Because dicots and monocots PLIM2 genes are strongly expressed in pollen, it is probable that these asterids δLIM2 genes are also strongly expressed in pollen, but it is not clear if these duplication events have brought any new functions in pollen development or in other processes. Poplar PtδLIM2a and b protein sequences deduced from the P. trichocarpa genome are phylogenetically distant from the PLIM2 subgroups. So far there is no expression data for their potential pollen-specific expression.3.3. Sequence and structural analysis of plant LIM domain proteinThe plant LIM domain proteins present a lot of common features with the CRP proteins, but also several specificities. This is the case for the GRR following each LIM domain found in the animal CRP proteins that lacks in all the plant LIM domain proteins.7 However, for all plant LIM domain proteins, a glycine residue is strictly conserved nine amino acids after the last zinc ligand for each LIM domain (Fig. 5B). The potential nuclear targeting signal (KKYGPK) present in the CRP family of animal LIM proteins is also missing in the plant LIM domain family. The LIM domains contain two zinc finger repeated in tandem with the characteristic structure [C-X2-C-X17-H-X2-C]-X2-[C-X2-C-X17-C-X2-H] (Fig. 5).7 Compared with the CRP family in animals, the second LIM domain in plants is atypical with the second ligand of the second zinc finger replaced by a conserved glycine. It has been proposed that closer histidine or cysteine makes the formation of two alternative structures -C-X-H-X18-C-X2-H- or -C-X4-C-X15-C-X2-H- possible for the zinc coordination.10 However, the increased number of protein sequences analyzed reveals that this histidine residue is sometimes lacking in the LIM proteins from the βLIM1 and δLIM2 groups (Supplementary Fig. S4). Only the cysteine residue is conserved in all plant LIM domain proteins, strongly suggesting that the -C-X4-C-X15-C-X2-H- is the most probable structure for the second zinc finger. Interestingly, the first cysteine of the first LIM domain is missing only for the sugarcane-duplicated SoWLIM1b protein and in maize for the second allelic version of ZmWLIM1 protein supported by the cDNA AY112454 (data not shown). If this cysteine is compulsory for the formation of the zinc finger, the functional significance of this absence remains to be elucidated. In both animal CRP and plant LIM families, with the exception of the monocots PLIM2 protein, a highly conserved K[T/A]VY motif is found in the first LIM domain close to the second cysteine of the first zinc finger (Fig. 5B). This common motif may be important in the correct folding of the LIM1 domain, and is also found, but conserved to a lesser extent, at the same position in the second LIM domain. In general, the amino acids surrounding the LIM domains are also highly conserved between LIM proteins of each subgroup with the noticeable exception of the δLIM2 proteins (Fig. 5A and B). It should be pointed out that the LIM1 domain is generally more conserved than the LIM2 domain. However, in WLIM2 proteins, both LIM domains are highly conserved.(A) Diagrammatic representation of motifs found in the sequences of the plant LIM family proteins. The LIM1 and LIM2 domains are represented by black boxes. ASN glycosylation sites are shown in triangles. cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP), CKII, Tyr, and PKC phosphorylation sites are, respectively, shown in grey and white diamonds, grey and white circles.

X represents any amino acid residue.As for animals, plant LIM proteins may have a function in the regulation of cell differentiation or development. LIM proteins could have multiple partners in the cell, such as actin or tubulin cytoskeleton, DNA and other potential proteins. It has been proposed that plant LIM proteins may serve as a shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus for yet unknown functions. In this respect, we searched for putative phosphorylation and glycosylation sites in the LIM protein sequences using the Prosite database. Thanks to the high number of sequences collected, we have been able to perform ortholog sequence comparisons within subgroups to find conserved motifs using the MEME program. Most of the differences observed between these LIM proteins are concentrated either in the inter-LIM region or in the C-ter domain (Fig. 5). Within the αLIM1 group, PLIM1 proteins are more divergent each other than WLIM1 and FLIM1 proteins. The C-ter domain of PLIM1 proteins is more different than in WLIM1 proteins and contains additional proline residues (Supplementary Fig. S4). FLIM1 proteins mostly resemble WLIM1 proteins, particularly at the level of the LIM domains. Their inter-LIM domain is more similar to those of monocots WLIM1 proteins, whereas their C-ter domain differs clearly from that of the other subgroups. Proteins within the βLIM1 group carry on their LIM domains, the structural properties characteristic of both WLIM2 and αLIM1 groups, but the inter-LIM and C-ter domains are specific to this group. WLIM2 proteins have highly conserved sequences, even at the level of the inter-LIM region, except for WLIM2 proteins from conifers and caryophyllales. The δLIM2 group is the most heterogeneous LIM group even at the level of LIM domains. The δLIM2 proteins are characterized by a long C-ter domain highly variable in amino acid composition, and composed of many acidic amino acids, particularly glutamic acid (Supplementary Fig. S4). It has been suggested for tobacco NtLIM1 protein that this acidic domain may function as a transcription activator.15 Interestingly, on the contrary to PLIM2 and αLIM1 proteins, the C-ter domain of WLIM2 proteins is rather basic and contains non-polar amino acids except one conserved acidic amino acid at the end of the protein. The C-ter domain of βLIM1 proteins has a variable pI. The pI is rather basic in the Solanaceae-duplicated proteins, and acid to neutral for the Asteraceae proteins (data not shown). Different kinds of motifs like the ASN glycosylation site, the casein kinase II (CKII), the tyrosine (Tyr), and the protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites are localized inside and outside the LIM domains (Fig. 5). For example, in αLIM1 and βLIM1 proteins and only in these proteins, a putative PKC phosphorylation site is found just before the first zinc ligand of the LIM1 domain. However, the FLIM1 proteins (from the αLIM1 group) do not possess this phosphorylation site. Finally, another PKC phosphorylation site is exclusively found at the C-ter domain in WLIM2 proteins from angiosperm and also gymnosperm species, suggesting a key function for this site.3.4. Concluding remarksIn this work, we report on the first analysis of poplar LIM domain protein family with the characterization of six PtaLIM cDNAs. Moreover, we updated the LIM genomic sequences in P. trichocarpa, A. thaliana, and O. sativa. The set of ESTs collected and the subsequent phylogenetic classification of LIM proteins provide a useful database for future researches on this family. We have defined four phylogenetic groups, αLIM1, βLIM1, γLIM2, and δLIM2, and positioned into these groups, the previously characterized PLIM1, WLIM1, PLIM2 and WLIM2 subgroups. The βLIM1 is a newly identified group, whose genes have an apparent preferential expression in undifferentiated cells. However, more detailed expression studies are needed for the functional analysis of these βLIM1 proteins. Besides, the pollen-specific expression of PLIM1 and PLIM2 genes, several subgroups seem to be specific to a plant class or subclass. This is the case for the PLIM1 subgroup that is represented only by LIM protein from the asterids subclass. Additionally, it appears that LIM proteins from monocots and eudicots plant are phylogenetically distant, suggesting specific functions within each taxonomic class. Finally, a new FLIM1 subgroup was created within the αLIM1 group, and the corresponding genes appear to be highly expressed in poplar G-fibers or cotton fibers. In poplar, the distribution of ESTs corresponding to WLIM1 and GLIM1 genes suggests the involvement of LIM proteins in wood fibers formation and/or vascular development. Despite the fact that plant LIM proteins could both bind to actin and act as a transcription factor, the function of LIM proteins remains largely unknown. Structural analysis is the first step to the functional characterization of LIM proteins in plants. In the future, we will need to determine whether all plant LIM proteins are able to bind actin cytoskeleton and/or DNA, and to examine the function of PLIM1 and PLIM2 proteins in pollen development or pollen tube elongation.We are grateful to J.-F.

Introduction Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota1 establish ecologically important symbiotic associations with the majority of land-plant species, allowing improved uptake of phosphate and other nutrients from the soil in exchange for plant-assimilated carbohydrates. 2 , 3 Additionally, AM fungi endow plants with tolerance to pathogens and abiotic stress. 4 , 5 In the process of colonization by AM fungi, the hyphae of extraradical mycelia branch near the host roots and form appressoria on the root surface, from which hyphae penetrate the epidermis and grow inter- and intracellularly in the root cortex. In the case of Arum -type AM (as formed in Lotus japonicus by Glomus mosseae or Gigaspora margarita ), the hyphae of intraradical mycelia form arbuscules, which are highly branched structures thought to be the main site of nutrient exchange between the two symbiotic partners. 2 , 3 , 6 Early land-plant fossils contain structures that appear similar to arbuscules, suggesting the important role of AM fungi in the colonization of land by plants. 7–9 In addition to AM symbiosis, leguminous plants establish a better-characterized symbiotic association with rhizobia, forming nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Recent molecular and genetic data suggest that the mechanism governing nodule formation evolved from that of AM symbiosis over time. 10 , 11 The development of AM symbiosis is generally thought to accompany complex signal perception and transduction, but the understanding of the latter at the molecular level is very limited, mainly because AM fungi are obligate symbionts and the leading model plant Arabidopsis thaliana does not form AM roots. For a better understanding, in silico data mining, 12 the subtractive hybridization approach, 13–15 and cDNA and oligonucleotide array analyses 16–20 have been performed for Medicago truncatula , a model legume. 21 , 22Medicago truncatula was also used to investigate the differential expression of chitinase genes in AM colonization, nodulation, and plant–pathogen interactions. 20 , 23Lotus japonicus is another valuable model legume. 24 For example, L. japonicus has been used for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of plant–AM fungi interactions. 25 Gene expression profiling with the aid of cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism has also been carried out. 10 For transcriptome analyses of host responses to AM fungi, we here made use of a large-scale cDNA array of L. japonicus , 26 , 27 carefully eliminating the effects of contaminating microorganisms in the soil inoculants. We compared the results with a gene expression profile of root-nodule formation with Mesorhizobium loti , finding a number of genes commonly regulated during AM symbiosis and nodule formation. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and microorganismsLotus japonicus Gifu B-129 seeds were scarified, surface-sterilized with 1% NaClO, rinsed eight times with sterile water, and then spread on 0.7% water agar plates for germination. The plates were placed for a week in a controlled-environment growth chamber (Sanyo, Tokyo, Japan) with a 16-h-day and 8-h-night cycle at 25°C, and a light intensity of 260 µEs −1 m −2 with 60% humidity.  For AM colonization, glass tubes (30 mm diameter × 120 mm length) containing 55 mL of vermiculite supplemented with 45 mL of modified Hornum nutrient solution were autoclaved before transferring the seedlings. The concentration of phosphate was reduced from 640 µM 24 to 250 µM to facilitate the colonization. The soil inoculant of G. mosseae (2 g/tube; a gift from K. Nagashima, Idemitsu Kosan, Tokyo, Japan) was suspended in sterilized water and then added to the tubes. For the control plants, the G. mosseae inoculant suspension was filtered through a 38 µm stainless mesh and the filtrate was added to the tubes. The resulting sieved carrier was free of G. mosseae spores but contaminated by microorganisms equivalent to those in the whole inoculum suspension. The seedlings were grown for up to 8 weeks in a growth chamber with occasional irrigation with the modified Hornum solution. For inoculation of G. margarita (Central Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan), large spores were picked up with forceps under a stereomicroscope, surface-treated with 0.1% NaClO for 7 min, and then rinsed five times with sterilized water. The seedlings were inoculated with the spores and grown as above. The control plants were mock-inoculated with the final rinse and then allowed to grow further. Assessment of AM colonization was carried out by the gridline intersect method 28 after staining with trypan blue. 29 When the initial stage of AM symbiosis was examined, we modified the ‘nurse pot’ method, 30 as follows. Giant spores of G. margarita were picked up with forceps from a commercial inoculum (Central Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan), surface-treated with 0.1% NaClO, and then rinsed with sterile water. Three sterile L. japonicus seedlings (1-week-old) were inoculated with 500 spores in an autoclaved plastic container (11 cm diameter × 16 cm height; Takeya Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) with a lid and then allowed to grow further. As a non-inoculated control, the final rinse of the sterilized spores was applied to sterile seedlings in another container, followed by further growth. After 2 months, freshly prepared sterile seedlings (2-week-old) were transplanted into the containers and then allowed to grow for a week. Then, roots of the younger plants were harvested from the container inoculated with G. margarita or the mock-inoculated container.  For root-nodule formation, L. japonicus seedlings were inoculated with M. loti Tono and then grown for 2 weeks on vermiculite supplied with nitrogen-free Broughton and Dilworth medium as described previously. 31 , 32 The resulting young nodules were harvested. 2.2. cDNA array analysis Total RNA was extracted from AM roots, root nodules, or control roots using an RNeasy Plant Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Labeling of target cDNA, hybridization of a large-scale nylon filter array with the target, washing of membranes under high-stringency conditions, detection of radioactive images, and data mining were all carried out as described previously. 262.3. Real-time RT–PCR analysis After treating the total RNA preparation with DNase, reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT) and Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR with a real-time RT–PCR Core Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) and a Smart Cycler system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was carried out as described previously. 32 , 33 The forward and reverse primer sets and annealing temperatures (in parentheses) were as follows: 5′-CAGTGACAAAAGGTTTGGACCTAC-3′ and 5′-ATGCAGAGAGATGTTGCTGCTG-3′ (68°C) for LjCyp2 ; 5′-AACTTTATTAGTAACTTTTAG-3′ and 5′-CTTTCACATCCGAGGAAATTG-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL1 ; 5′-GCTCAGGTGGCTGCCATCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGTGTGTGGTTTGTCTCG-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL2 ; 5′-AACTTTACTAG TTTCTTCAGG-3′ and 5′-TAATTCCATATTCCGCAAATT-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL3 ; 5′-GAATGCAGATCTTACCCGCTA-3′ and 5′-TTTGCTTAAATACAAAGAATG-3′ (50°C) for LjPAL4 ; 5′-GAATGCAGATCTTACCCGCTG-3′ and 5′-ATTGCATTTGCATAAATACAG-3′ (50°C) for LjPAL5 ; 5′-AACTTAACCATTTATTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-TTGTAATGTAATGTGAGATGG-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL6 ; 5′-TTGGCTAGCATCGATTCAGGA-3′ and 5′-GTCCAGGGTGGTGCTTAAGCC-3′ (50°C) for LjPAL7 ; 5′-GCTCAGGTGGCTGCCATCGCA-3′ and 5′-GGCAGGGTGTGAGTTGATTCA-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL8 ; 5′-AACTTGCCTGCCAGTTATGTT-3′ and 5′-CTCTTGTGTTTTTCTGTAGTG-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL9 ; and 5′-AGAACAGTTTGTTTGTTTGAG-3′ and 5′-CATAAAGGAGAACTTAAAGGA-3′ (55°C) for LjPAL10 . Amplification of the β-actin gene was carried out as described previously. 33 A single amplicon of expected size, 100–300 bp, with each primer set was observed on agarose gel electrophoresis, irrespective of whether the reverse-transcribed template was from AM roots or control roots. In order to calculate the transcript level ratios, it was assumed that each PCR cycle results in exact doubling of the amounts of amplicons. 2.4. In situ hybridizationIn situ hybridization of paraffin-embedded sections was carried out as described previously. 31 , 33 , 342.5. Promoter-β-glucuronidase construction, hairy root transformation and histochemical analysis of L. japonicus The 2 kb 5′ flanking region of LjPAL1 contains a Bam HI site. Therefore, to amplify the region derived from genomic DNA of L. japonicus , forward primer 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTGACCGACAATGGTTTATGAAC TAGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTGATCACTTAGTATATATGATCTCTCACTTACA-3′, containing Not I and BclI sites, respectively, were used for PCR. The BclI end of the promoter was ligated to the Bam HI site 24 bp upstream of the coding sequence of the uidA gene for the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter with a nopaline synthase terminator. Then, making use of the SalI sites at the ends of the intermediate construct, the promoter-GUS unit was ligated into the Sal I site of pHKN29, 35 which is a derivative of pCAMBIA 1300 (CAMBIA, Canberra, Australia).  Hairy root transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes LBA 1334 was performed following the protocol of Diaz and Schlaman, Leiden University, as described previously. 33 , 35 Transformants with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive hairy roots were transferred to vermiculite containing the modified Hornum solution, inoculated with the entire G. mosseae inoculum or sieved carrier, and then grown as described above. When nodule formation was examined, the transformants were transferred to nitrogen-free Broughton and Dilworth medium and then inoculated with M. loti Tono.  Detached roots were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β- d -glucuronide, and then the reaction was stopped with 75% ethanol as described previously. 35 When AM fungi were re-stained, the roots were immersed in 0.02% safranin and then observed under a stereomicroscope. Quantitative assaying of GUS activity in hairy roots was performed as described previously, 35 based on the method of Jefferson et al.36 GUS-stained roots were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), washed with Na-phosphate buffer, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 90, and 100%), immersed in 50% Technovit 7100 (Heraeus Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany) in ethanol, and then left to stand overnight. Then, they were embedded in Technovit 7100 at room temperature by adding the polymerization agent provided in the kit. Six-micrometer sections were prepared and re-stained with 0.02% safranin when necessary. 2.6. Accession numbers The entire nucleotide sequences of cDNAs for cysteine proteinases and PALs were determined. The accession numbers for the sequences mentioned in this paper are as follows: AB300459 ( LjCyp1 ), AB300460 ( LjCyp2 ), AB300461 ( LjCyp3 ), AB300462 ( LjCyp4 ), AB283031 ( LjPAL1 ), AB283032 ( LjPAL2 ), AB283033 ( LjPAL3 ), AB283034 ( LjPAL4 ), AB283035 ( LjPAL5 ), AB283036 ( LjPAL6 ), AB283037 ( LjPAL7 ), AB283038 ( LjPAL8 ), AB283039 ( LjPAL9 ), and AB283040 ( LjPAL10 ).

Setting up cDNA array experiments with AM roots In this work, we made use of a large-scale array of cDNAs from entire seedlings, pods, roots, and root nodules of L. japonicus . 26 , 27 We grew L. japonicus plants with or without AM fungi in the presence of 250 µM phosphate. At that phosphate concentration, AM fungi colonized well and the effects of phosphate depletion did not need to be taken into account. Under our growth conditions, the root length colonization by G. mosseae was 20 and 60% at 3 and 6 weeks after inoculation, respectively. The colonization by G. margarita was 10 and 30–40% at 5 and 8 weeks after inoculation, respectively. It has been pointed out that fungal transcripts account for up to 12% of the entire transcripts of AM roots, 37 which sometimes complicates analysis. 10 , 12–15 On the other hand, since the plant materials used for our array were grown avoiding microorganisms other than M. loti , a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of L. japonicus , our array did not contain fungal genes, making the analysis of global plant gene-expression easier.  Extraction of RNA, preparation of radioactive targets, and hybridization were principally performed for two biological replicates, although in the experiments involving G. margarita , the procedures were carried out in duplicate for a single biological replicate. The signal intensities of array filters in each experiment were normalized as described previously. 26 When the normalized signal intensities were compared after the two independent series of experiments, the variation was found to be basically within the twofold expression ratio (Supplementary Fig. S1A), indicating the sufficient reproducibility of our experiments.  In the initial experiments, we compared the gene-expression patterns of AM roots formed with a commercial inoculant and sterile non-infected roots, as in most previous studies. 12–15 , 17–19 Then, we picked up statistically significantly different genes expressed in roots 6 weeks after inoculation of the whole G. mosseae inoculum compared with those in control roots 3 weeks after inoculation of the sieved carrier, by means of the Significance Analysis of Microarrays Program. 38 Supplementary Table S1 shows a list of the apparently up-regulated genes in AM roots. Closely related genes annotated as caffeic acid O -methyltransferase were most differently expressed. Lectin genes were also differentially expressed, as previously reported. 13 , 15 , 19 The up-regulation of a gene for subtilisin-like serine protease was similar to the finding of Liu et al. , 16 although serine carboxypeptidase genes were not listed in our experiment. The differential expression of chitinase genes was in accordance with a previous study. 23 Glutathione S -transferase genes were reported to be up-regulated in AM roots. 12–14 , 20 In our experiment, a gene for glutathione S -transferase (GNf044a01) was also up-regulated by 1.61- and 2.51-fold 3 and 6 weeks, respectively, after inoculantion (not included in the supplementary table). The expression levels of blue copper protein genes 12 , 13 , 18 , 20 varied from experiment to experiment under our conditions (data not shown). Overall, the data in Supplementary Table S1 are consistent with those in previous papers. 12–20 Notably, when the G. mosseae inoculum suspension and sieved carrier were diluted and streaked on yeast extract/peptone/glucose plates, many colonies of contaminating microorganisms appeared, their numbers and appearances being similar to each other (data not shown). Thus, the above cDNA array analysis was performed in the constant presence of background microorganisms in the AM root material. We next filtered the G. mosseae inoculant suspension through a 38 µm stainless mesh, L. japonicus seedlings were grown in the presence of the filtrate, and then the gene expression in the resulting roots was compared with that in non-infected ones. Supplementary Table S2 shows the effects of contaminating microorganisms. Genes encoding PAL, chalcone synthase and chalcone reductase, which are involved in important steps of flavonoid phytoalexin synthesis, 39 and WRKY transcription factors, which are mainly involved in tolerance to pathogen-related stress, 40 were remarkably induced. The genes annotated as caffeic acid O -methyltransferase, and those for chitinase and glutathione S -transferase were also induced. Therefore, the results in Supplementary Table S1 represent super-positioning of the effects of the AM fungus and contaminating microorganisms in the inoculant. It is noteworthy that commercial AM fungus inoculants have been used easily in a number of investigations on plant gene expression in AM roots. 12–15 , 17–19 Care must be taken regarding contamination in nurse plants used for inoculation of the AM fungus. 10 On the other hand, in the works of Liu et al.16 , 20 and Salzer et al. 23 on M. truncatula , Guimil et al.41 on rice, and ours on L. japonicus and G. margarita (see below), aseptic spores of AM fungi were inoculated into plants, making the populations of contaminating microorganisms, if any, similar between AM roots and control roots. 3.2. Expression profiling of up- and down-regulated plant genes after colonization by AM fungi In order to subtract the above-described effects of contaminating microorganisms, we compared the gene expression patterns of AM roots inoculated with the whole G. mosseae inoculum and control roots inoculated with the sieved carrier only. When the average intensities on duplicate determination of gene expression were compared, the patterns indicated a significant difference in gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B). AM-enhanced genes were first identified after colonization by G. mosseae and G. margarita (Table  1 ) because they have attracted more interest than repressed ones. 12–15 , 17 , 19 Genes for aquaporins, also annotated as plasma-membrane intrinsic protein, tonoplast intrinsic protein, and nodulin 26-like protein, were up-regulated in AM roots, confirming the results in several reports. 14 , 17 , 19 Annexin genes were also induced in AM roots, in accordance with Manthey et al.17 Four cysteine proteinase genes, designated as LjCyp1-4 , were most obviously up-regulated among the AM-enhanced genes (Table  1 ), confirming previous reports. 10 , 16 – 18 Although there were around 20 cysteine proteinase genes on our array membrane, the expression of other genes did not change or was rather repressed in AM roots. Real-time RT–PCR showed that LjCyp2 , a representative of the four genes, was induced only at the late stage of G. mosseae colonization (Fig.  1 A). The expression of LjCyp2 was also high in G. margarita -colonized roots at the late stage (data not shown). Our in situ localization revealed that the induced LjCyp2 gene was specifically expressed in arbuscule-containing inner cortical cells of G. mosseae -colonized roots (Fig.  1 C). The LjCyp1 transcript showed a very similar localization (not shown) to that of LjCyp2 . The spatial expression patterns of AM-induced genes fall into two groups. The glutathione S -transferase, 13 serine carboxypeptidase, 16 annexin, 17 and calcium-binding protein 10 genes were reported to be expressed not only in arbuscule-containing cells but also in the cells around them. In contrast, the endoglucanase (MtCel1), 16 cysteine-rich antifungal protein, 19 and AM-induced phosphate transporter 33 genes were specifically expressed in cells that contained fungal arbuscules. The present study revealed that the Lotus cysteine proteinase genes are members of the latter group. It is noteworthy that the cysteine proteinase genes are expressed early in cells containing arbuscules just after maturation, whereas their levels are quite low in cells with very young arbuscules (Fig.  1 E). The induced cysteine proteinases may be involved in the degradation of arbuscules, short-lived fungal organs, 2 since the PSORT program ( http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/ ) predicted that they are secreted proteins. Alternatively, these proteases may stay within the cells, e.g. in vacuoles 42 , 43 and play important roles in remodeling of intracellular structures, cell cycle progression, protein turnover etc. It is also interesting that the four cysteine proteinase genes are exactly the same genes as those that are highly induced in early-senescent root nodules of ineffective nitrogen fixation. 27 Expression levels and in situ localization of the LjCyp2 gene. The expression levels of the LjCyp2 ( A ) and ß-actin ( B ) genes relative to those in control roots 3 weeks after inoculation of the sieved carrier (SC3, level = 1) were determined by real-time RT–PCR. The means and variation of two independent experiments are shown. ni3, sterile non-infected roots grown for 3 weeks; Gm6, roots 6 weeks after inoculation of the whole G. mosseae inoculum; gni1, roots 1 week after mock-inoculation; and Gi1, roots 1 week after inoculation of G. margarita (see Materials and Methods and the legend to Table  3 for details). Longitudinal AM root sections were probed with digoxygenine-labeled antisense RNA prepared from the entire LjCyp2 cDNA ( C and E ). Hybridization signals are visible as a dark blue color. When sense RNA was used as a negative control probe, much lower hybridization signals were detected except in central cylinders ( D ). Bars, 50 µm.

When sense RNA was used as a negative control probe, much lower hybridization signals were detected except in central cylinders ( D ). Bars, 50 µm.  A promoter region of a calcium-binding protein gene of L. japonicus was reported to be activated during AM development. 10 We found that a cDNA for the calcium-binding protein (MWM036h04_r) is present on our array membrane. Unexpectedly, however, the mRNA level did not show significant variation under our experimental conditions. The mRNA level of the gene did not vary on root-nodule formation, either ( http://est.kazusa.or.jp/en/plant/lotus/EST/cDNA.html ). The promoter activity of the gene may not coincide with its transcript level.  In the present study, AM-repressed genes were also identified after colonization by G. mosseae or G. margarita (Table  2 ). Five PAL genes were repressed most drastically after colonization by G. mosseae . In addition, four and two genes for chalcone synthase and chalcone reductase, respectively, were found to be repressed. These three enzymes catalyze key reactions in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid compounds. Another series of duplicate experiments involving G. margarita supported this finding. Thus, the reproducibility of the repression of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-related genes was confirmed unequivocally. Liu et al. presented a small list of AM-repressed genes. 16 Our finding that particular forms of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and glutathione S -transferase are repressed is in accordance with their results. Hohnjec et al. , 18 Kistner et al. , 10 and Guimil et al.41 presented larger lists of AM-repressed genes of M. truncatula , L. japonicus , and rice, respectively, but neither PAL genes nor chalcone synthase ones were included in the lists. In the work of Hohnjec et al. , 18 for example, many stress-related genes were listed as 	AM-repressed genes, because they were highly up-regulated in the phosphate-starved control roots. Very recently, Liu et al. presented the largest list of AM-repressed genes in M. truncatula roots as well as those in other portions. 20 Again, however, PAL genes were not included in their list of repressed genes. We will confirm our current results by promoter analysis and discuss the discrepancy (see below). Besides phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-related genes, a phosphate transporter gene ( LjPT1 ) was also repressed (Table  2 ). This finding is in accord with the general tendency that the expression of common phosphate transporters is suppressed in AM roots. 44 – 46 A recently found AM root-enhanced phosphate transporter gene of L. japonicus33 was not found on the present nylon filter. 3.3. Differential expression of plant genes caused by G. margarita infection in the initial stage of symbiosis In contrast to the later stage of symbiosis (Table  1 ), a number of genes were found to be up-regulated or down-regulated on the initial association with the AM fungus (Table  3 ). In accordance with previous reports, 16 , 47 – 52 the genes for enzymes involved in defense-related secondary metabolism and the pathogen response, such as PALs, chalcone synthases, and peroxidases, were moderately up-regulated at this stage. A number of genes for transcription or translation were also induced, suggesting that a dynamic cellular change in plant roots occurs at the initial stage of the AM association. In addition, several genes involved in signal transduction were up-regulated (Table  3 ). For example, the gene for a pathogen-induced receptor protein kinase with a characteristic extracellular domain was induced. 53 , 54 Transcripts for a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor, small GTP-binding proteins, protein serine/threonine kinases, and a mitogen-activated protein kinase were also accumulated. These gene products may represent signal transduction pathways for AM colonization.  Transcriptional changes caused by G. margarita infection in the initial stage of symbiosis  Because there is a varying lag time between sporulation and the arrival of AM hyphae on the host roots, the initial response to mycorrhizae is not necessarily synchronous. Therefore, we modified the ‘nurse pot’ method 30 as described under Materials and Methods. Freshly prepared sterile seedlings were transplanted into containers containing L. japonicus plants well-colonized by G. margarita or mock-inoculated plants and then allowed to grow for a week. Then, roots of the younger seedlings were harvested from the container inoculated with G. margarita (Gi1) or the mock-inoculated container (gni1). Radio-labeled target cDNAs were synthesized from total RNAs in the roots and then hybridized to a nylon filter cDNA array. 26 The normalized expression levels are shown in the gni1 and Gi1 columns. The expression levels relative to the mock-infected controls are given in the fold column. Genes that match hypothetical proteins of unknown function and ones that encode proteins exhibiting no homology to thus far known ones have been omitted from this table.

Expression patterns of PAL genes in L. japonicus PALs connect primary and secondary metabolism in plants, catalyzing common rate-limiting steps of flavonoid phytoalexin synthesis, lignin synthesis, salicylic acid synthesis, etc. The expression patterns of PAL genes in our experiments are very characteristic compared with those in previous studies. 10 , 12 – 20 , 41 Since PAL genes are known to form a family in a number of plant species, 55 we first checked how many PAL genes were present on the array membrane and found nine non-redundant ones. In addition, we found a TAC clone (Accession no. AP004502) containing a unique PAL gene, LjPAL5 , in the databases. As shown in Table  4 , most PAL genes were induced in the initial stage of AM infection and then repressed in the later stage. However, LjPAL10 did not seem to be expressed differentially. In addition, other genes, LjPAL7 and LjPAL9 , might be of the intermediate type. Thus, as pointed out previously, 55 care must be taken that PAL genes do not show similar expression patterns. Although the array membrane was washed under high-stringency conditions after hybridization, cross hybridization among the gene family members could not be excluded since the members are more than 80% identical to each other at the nucleotide level in their coding regions. Therefore, we performed real-time RT–PCR experiments with gene-specific primer sets to validate the differential expression of the PAL genes. The results of RT–PCR for all PAL genes were more or less the same as those of array analysis (Table  4 ). In addition, we found that the LjPAL5 gene, which was not found on the array membrane, was severely down-regulated in AM roots (Table  4 ). L. japonicus genes for PALs and their expression patterns  The lightface data in the Gi1/gni1, Gi8/gni3 and Gm6/SC3 columns are the fold values for gene expression in roots at 1 week and 8 weeks after inoculation of G. margarita , and 6 weeks after inoculation of G. mosseae , respectively, compared with those for control roots. The normalized expression levels observed in the array analyses are also given in parentheses. The boldface Gm6/SC3 column shows the results of real time RT–PCR (mean ± SD for four replicates) for gene expression in roots at 6 weeks after inoculation of G. mosseae , compared with those for control roots. L. japonicus genes for PALs and their expression patterns  The lightface data in the Gi1/gni1, Gi8/gni3 and Gm6/SC3 columns are the fold values for gene expression in roots at 1 week and 8 weeks after inoculation of G. margarita , and 6 weeks after inoculation of G. mosseae , respectively, compared with those for control roots.

The boldface Gm6/SC3 column shows the results of real time RT–PCR (mean ± SD for four replicates) for gene expression in roots at 6 weeks after inoculation of G. mosseae , compared with those for control roots.  To further confirm the repression of some PAL genes after AM colonization, we searched for genomic sequences of the PAL genes in databases, finding that LjPAL1 , LjPAL4 , and LjPAL5 lie in tandem on a single TAC clone, AP004502. We chose the LjPAL1 promoter, which shows typical differential expression, for further analysis. This promoter, 2 kb in size, was amplified by PCR, fused with the uidA reporter for GUS, and then introduced into L. japonicus by the hairy root method with A. rhizogenes . The transformants showed basal activity, especially in central cylinders, in the absence of any microorganisms (Fig.  2 A). The GUS activity was augmented throughout the roots in the presence of contaminating microorganisms in the sieved carrier (Fig.  2 B). When the transformants were inoculated with the whole G. mosseae inoculum, the area of expression decreased (Fig.  2 C). The specific GUS activity levels in the entire hairy roots of the above transformants were 1.2 ± 0.2, 7.1 ± 2.9, and 4.1 ± 1.5 pmol/min/µg protein, respectively. Unexpectedly, when GUS-stained AM roots were re-stained with safranin, a red dye that stains fungal cells better than plant cells, it turned out that G. mosseae only colonized where GUS activity was low (Fig.  2 C). To confirm this observation, sections of GUS-stained AM roots were prepared and then re-stained with safranin. As shown in Fig.  2 D and E, the root portions exhibiting high LjPAL1 promoter activity did not contain G. mosseae . In contrast, the AM fungus colonized well where the GUS level was low (Fig.  2 F and G). In some cases, G. mosseae was observed where GUS activity was also significant, but the level of GUS was not very high either (Fig.  2 H and I). As described above, the whole G. mosseae inoculum and the sieved carrier contained equivalent amounts of contaminating microorganisms. Therefore, host plants repress PAL gene expression where AM fungi colonize, preventing infection by pathogenic microorganisms. This repression pattern is similar to that of isoflavone reductase of M. truncatula previously reported, 50 but different from those of PAL and chalcone synthase observed in that study. Comprehensive expression analysis of every family member for the latter enzymes of M. truncatula would be necessary to resolve this discrepancy.

Commonly repressed genes of L. japonicus in AM roots and nitrogen-fixing nodules When the results of cDNA array experiments on AM roots with G. mosseae , and ones on G. margarita and mature root nodules with M. loti were compared with each other, the overlapping of induced genes or repressed genes was found to be limited (Supplementary Fig. S2), in accord with previous reports. 17 , 18 However, when the commonly regulated genes in G. mosseae -colonized roots and mature root nodules were listed up, it was obvious that many defense-related and stress-induced genes were included in the commonly repressed list (Table  3 ). They include genes for WRKY transcription factors, which are up-regulated in response to biotic or abiotic stress, 40 , 56 and those for BURP domain proteins, one of which is a stress-induced transcription factor, 57 besides PAL genes. These results suggest that host plants accept AM fungi and compatible rhizobia in similar manners, their defense mechanisms being suppressed.  Because LjPAL1 is one of the commonly repressed genes in AM roots and nodules (Table  5 ), we inoculated M. loti into hairy roots transformed with the LjPAL1 promoter-GUS construct. As shown in Fig.  2 J and K, strong GUS activity was detected at the top of a nodule primordium, but it had soon disappeared in a slightly more mature nodule, in accordance with the results of the array experiments (Table  5 ).  Co-regulated genes of L. japonicus in AM roots and nitrogen-fixing nodules  The gene expression levels in roots 6 weeks after inoculation with the whole inoculum of G. mosseae relative to those with the sieved carrier (Gm6/SC3) and those in mature nodules (4 weeks after inoculation of M. loti ) relative to in non-infected roots (Nod) were compared.

Concluding remarks We performed comprehensive transcriptome analysis and spatial examination of gene expression in AM roots and root nodules of L. japonicus , taking into account the effects of contaminating microorganisms. We found that several cysteine protease genes were specifically induced in arbuscule-containing cells of AM roots. Moreover, we also found that PAL and other phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-related genes were moderately induced on the initial infection of the symbionts and then repressed concomitant with the establishment of the two symbioses. Characteristic expression patterns were observed both in the absence of contaminating microorganisms (Table  4 , experiments with G. margarita ; Fig.  2 J and K) and more drastically in their presence (Table  4 , experiments with G. mosseae ; Fig.  2 A–I). So far, it has been suggested that defense genes for AM fungi or rhizobia are initially up-regulated and then down-regulated. 16 , 26 , 47 – 52 , 58 Nevertheless, the current study is unexpectedly the first demonstration that this prediction is correct especially for AM root formation with G. mosseae and G. margarita using a large scale cDNA array. Then, why did previous works on AM roots not reveal the unique expression patterns of PAL and other phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-related genes? When the expression levels of these genes in roots with commercial inoculants of AM fungi applied were examined, 12 – 15 , 17 – 19 it is possible that their induction by contaminating microorganisms and their repression by AM fungus colonization were super-imposed, resulting in comparable levels to those in sterile non-infected roots. Actually, when we did a similar experiment, 12 – 15 , 17 – 19 we did not detect the differential expression of most PAL genes except LjPAL10 , which was moderately up-regulated (Supplementary Table S1). Other previous works in which aseptic spores of AM fungi were inoculated did not show significant down-regulation of these phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-related genes, either. 16 , 20 , 41 On the other hand, our experiments involving NaClO-treated G. margarita spores revealed repression of the genes. It is difficult at present to fully explain this discrepancy. As revealed in this work, however, the varying microbial population around AM roots significantly affects gene expression and hence the reproducibility of the experiments. If our surface-sterilization of the spores was not complete, for example, the differential expression of plant genes on G. margarita colonization might be similar to that on application of a commercial G. mosseae inoculant.  The presence of contaminating microorganisms is, in a sense, closer to natural field conditions than the inoculation of aceptical spores of AM fungi into sterile plants. The spatial investigation in this study revealed that a PAL gene, LjPAL1 , is repressed where AM fungi colonized. Although PALs are multi-functional enzymes, we consider that the defense response including de novo synthesis of flavonoid phytoalexins against other microorganisms than AM fungi is suppressed. In nature, host plants may accept microsymbionts by suppressing their defense reactions to a minimum level at which they may still prevent infection by pathogens.  We wish to thank Drs. K.

Thus, this first RH panel will be a useful tool for mapping mutated genes in Medaka.1. Introduction Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping is an efficient way for ordering markers in correlation with physical distance on the chromosome and establish links with genetic maps and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs. 1 , 2 An RH panel consists of cell hybrids that randomly retain fragments of chromosomes from the donor cells. These hybrids are produced by fusion of irradiated donor cell of the species of interest with a recipient cell line, usually of rodent origin and have the following features: (i) Markers are scored by PCR analysis for the presence or the absence of DNA from the hybrids. Therefore, markers to be mapped need not to be polymorphic in RH mapping, which facilitates the production of dense maps of the genome. Markers with similar patterns of retention in the collection of hybrids are placed close to each other on the map. (ii) RH mapping depends on random physical breakage of chromosomes by irradiation and thereby reflects physical distance, whereas genetic mapping relies on meiotic recombination rate. Markers close to the centromere, which are difficult to be resolved by genetic mapping, can be ordered in RH mapping. (iii) Furthermore, the resolution of the RH panel can be adjusted by the dose of radiation to achieve the resolution required for linking the RH map with a genetic map and/or with BAC contigs. 1 , 2 Thus, RHs of human, 3–5 dog, 6 rat, 7 mouse, 8 , 9 and zebrafish 10 , 11 have played a key role in localizing markers and anchoring BAC contigs on the chromosomes.  The Medaka, Oryzias latipes , a small freshwater fish, 12 has proven to be an excellent genetic system for developmental, environmental, and evolutionary biology studies. A genetic linkage map of Medaka that consists of 24 linkage groups (LG) corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of the organism was established. 13 Recently, genomic resource of Medaka including EST, 14 genetic map, 13 , 15 and genomic DNA sequence, 16 whole-genome shotgun data on UT browser ( http://medaka.utgenome.org/ ), has been developed. Furthermore, a large-scale systematic mutagenesis screen was performed in Medaka to explore gene functions in developmental processes. 17 To facilitate the identification of affected genes in Medaka mutants, we established a whole-genome Medaka RH panel consisting of 93 clones. As the first step toward the development of a Medaka RH map, we constructed RH maps for three chromosomes LG12, 17, and 22. 2. Generation of Medaka RHs Two-hundred and ninety RH clones were produced by fusing donor cells from the Medaka fin fibroblast cell line OLF-136 18 (obtained from Riken Cell Bank, RCB 0184), derived from HB32 South Strain with B78 mouse melanoma cells, as described by Hukriede et al. 11 For this purpose, a subline of OLF-136 with the highest percentage of euploid cells was selected by karyotyping and used to generate RHs. As the mouse melanoma B78 recipient cell line is not deficient in any enzyme that would allow selection of hybrid cells, we generated OLF-136 clones that randomly integrated the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene that confers resistance to G418 into the chromosomes. More than 500 independent G418 OLF-136 clones were pooled and 3 × 10 7 cells from this pool were subjected to X-ray irradiation at a dose of 5000 rad (50 Gy). The irradiated cells were mixed with an equal number of B78 cells and fused in the presence of polyethylene glycol. After 3 weeks, G418-resistant colonies were picked and expanded for DNA extraction or frozen to maintain stocks. 3. Establishment of the Medaka RH panel To carry out the genotyping of the RH panel in a 96-well microtiter plate format, we selected 93 RH clones by the following procedures: (i) Among the 290 RHs, we first selected 136 RHs that gave clear bands in PCR genotyping, using 932 STS (sequence-tagged site) markers randomly selected from the 24 LGs. (ii) Among these 136 RHs, 93 RHs were selected on the basis of their high retention of Medaka chromosomes fragments. For independent estimates of retention, 19 among those markers that gave no more than one typing error in triplicate genotyping assays, only one or two markers with the largest distance on the genetic map were chosen from a single LG. The retention frequency of the selected 93 RH clones based on 26 STS markers from 15 LGs was 16%.  The RHs were genotyped by PCR amplification, followed by gel electrophoresis, and the results of genotyping for a marker, designated as an RH vector, were documented as described. 19 Sequences of STS markers were obtained from the MBASE ( http://mbase.bioweb.ne.jp/ ). PCR reactions were set up in a 384-well format, using the Biomeck 2000 robotic system (Beckman, USA). Since the donor Medaka chromosomal fragments are retained at different molarities among the RH cell lines, the intensity of amplified bands may vary among them. 3 Therefore, genotyping of the RHs was carried out three times to minimize discordance. Discordance between the multiple runs of a marker was kept below 7% of the total number of RHs. The markers that showed higher discordance were eliminated. 4. Generation of RH maps for three Medaka chromosomes To generate RH maps for the three chromosomes (Fig.  1 ), we took the following steps. The numbers of markers relevant to each step are listed in Table  1 . Comparison of the RH and genetic maps for the three Medaka chromosomes. Positional relationships of the markers on the RH (left) and genetic (right) maps are indicated by green lines. The distances between adjacent markers are shown in centiRay in the RH maps and centiMorgan in the genetic maps. In the RH maps, there are two gaps indicated as ‘Gap’ in LG17 and 22. The markers used to build the framework map are shown in red and those used for later placement are in black. On the genetic maps, centromeric regions are indicated in purple.Comparison of the RH and genetic maps for the three Medaka chromosomes.

A total of 159 STS markers from the genetic map, that is, 50, 60, and 49 markers from LG12, 17, and 22, respectively, were subjected to genotyping on the RH panel. Twenty-six of these markers were excluded because they yielded no PCR products or ambiguous bands, leaving 133 markers (84%) for the following RH map construction. We used the TSP/CONCORD program to analyze the RH vectors, as described in the following section.We checked whether the 133 markers fall into three groups corresponding to the three genetic LGs by searching linked markers with a threshold of pairwise LOD scores up to 5. This resulted in three LGs in agreement with the genetic map, as well as 17 singletons. The singletons were discarded. The three LGs included 42, 42, and 32 markers (total 116) from LG12, 17, and 22, respectively.To generate high-confidence framework maps, markers from each LG in the previous step were analyzed with a pairwise LOD score threshold of 7. Three disconnected framework marker sets with two gaps were formed for LG17 and LG22, whereas a single-framework map with no gap was formed for LG12. Those disconnected framework marker sets were oriented and linked by referring to the linkage information of the genetic map to make one framework map for LG17 and 22.Finally, to compose the final RH maps, we put the rest of the markers on the framework map, using the placement program. The two gaps in the framework maps of LG12 and 22 could not be filled up by this procedure. The final RH maps of the three LGs and the comparison between the RH and genetic maps are shown in Fig.  1 . Remarkably, comparisons of the placement of the markers in the RH maps with those in the genetic maps indicated that the markers with poor resolution in genetic maps in the putative centromeric regions (shown in purple) could be well resolved in the RH maps.  As shown in Table  2 , given the estimated physical lengths, 30, 32, and 29 Mb, of LG12, 17, and 22, respectively, the physical distances corresponding to 1 cR 5000 were calculated to be 41, 35, and 46 kb for LG12, 17, and 22, respectively. The average marker retention frequencies for LG12, 17, and 22 were 26, 16, and 13%, respectively. Characteristics of RH maps for three Medaka LGsCharacteristics of RH maps for three Medaka LGs The three RH maps have a high confidence since the framework linkage maps were obtained with an LOD score > 7 and each marker was linked at least to one other marker with an LOD score > 5 (corresponding to a likelihood of >100 000:1) in the final RH maps (Table  1 and Fig.  1 ). A total of 110 markers, 83% of the 133 markers that gave the RH vectors, could be placed on the final RH maps (Table  1 ). The lower success rate (75%) for LG22 could be due to its lower retention (13%; Tables  1 and 2 ). The average resolution of the three RH maps is 186 kb, which is high enough to place BAC clones (150–200 kb) on the RH maps. The average retention frequency of the 110 markers mapped to the three LGs was 19% (Table  2 ). This is comparable with whole-genome RH panels of other species whose overall retention ranges between 16 and 30%. 9 – 11 , 20 , 21 Recently, the Medaka genome sequence has become accessible: the complete sequence of LG22 by BAC-based sequencing approach 15 and the assembled sequence data from the whole-genome shotgun approach (UT genome browser). The alignment of the RH and genetic maps with the complete sequence of LG22 showed a high correlation of the RH map with the physical length of the genome (Fig.  2 i). The poorly resolved region in the male genetic map of LG22 (shown by the red line at 33 cM, nine out of 30 markers) was resolved into 170 cR, which corresponds to 11.4 Mb. This region spans nearly one-third of the LG22 genome sequence. Similar results were obtained for LG12 and 17 assembled sequences (Fig.  2 ii and iii). Markers that were not found in the genome sequences (those plotted at 0 Mb), 2, 3, and 1 on LG22, 12, and 17, respectively, were successfully mapped on the RH maps. These results further corroborate the usefulness of RH maps for establishing the complete sequence of the Medaka genome.  Consistency of the RH maps with the genome sequence. Markers on the LG22, 12, 17 were plotted on the Y axis as genetic map position in centi-Morgan (cM) (pink) and RH map position in cR (blue) and on the X axis as the position in the BAC-based genome sequence of ( i ) LG22 or assembled the whole genome shotgun sequence reads of ( ii ) LG12 and ( iii ) LG17. In the case of LG22, markers poorly resolved on the red line (nine out of 30 markers) at 33.8 cM on the genetic map were resolved into 170 cR (B) on the RH map that corresponds to 11.4 Mb (A), one-third of the physical length of LG22. The poorly resolved regions in LG12 and 17 were resolved into 154 and 338 cR, which correspond to13.0 and 14.2 Mb, one-third and nearly a half of the chromosome. Markers that were not found in the genome sequence (those plotted at 0 Mb), 2, 3, and 1 on LG22, 12, and 17, respectively, were successfully mapped on the RH maps.

Taken together, we produced the first whole-genome RH panel for mapping genes and markers in Medaka and demonstrated that it is suitable to build a genome-wide RH map. The construction of RH maps for the other Medaka LGs is ongoing. We will distribute the Medaka RH panel upon request to the corresponding author and provide assistance in RH mapping efforts.5. Computation of RH maps To construct RH maps, the TSP/CONCORD V2.0 software package, 22 working with IBM DB2, was used on an IBM RS/6000 AIX workstation. TSP/CONCORD was used in conjunction with CONCORD and QSopt software to calculate RH maps by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. 23 This method has been proven to be rapid and efficient for integrating large data and constructing an RH map. 22 We referred to TSP/CONCORD's manual to analyze RH vectors and to compute the marker order of each LG and the distance between markers. In the package, there are five objective functions for the evaluation of an RH vector available: two of them are based on obligate chromosome breaks (OCBs) and three on a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). Since the OCB objective functions do not provide indications for estimating physical distances between markers and for comparing likelihoods of competing marker orders, only the three MLE objectives, namely, BASE TSP + MLE, Extended TSP + MLE, and Normalize TSP + MLE, were used in our computations. To construct the framework maps, most of the parameters were set to the program default values; three of them are sensitive for restricting the number of markers in computation, they were LIMIT_DISTANCE = 3, LIMIT_ 	LIKELIHOOD = 3, and UNKNOWN_COUNT = 2. First, pairwise LOD scores and distances for each pair of markers were computed by using the TSP/CONCORD ‘pairlods_dists’ program. At an LOD score threshold of 5, the program ‘make_groups’ was executed to find LGs for all markers. Singletons were abandoned. For each of those LGs, marker sets were identified at an LOD score threshold of 7 by using again the ‘make_groups’ program. Subsequently, the framework maps of each marker set were computed by using the MLE objective functions in the package. We confirmed the robustness of each framework map by making sure that there are no improving flips of up to eight markers by using the program ‘flips’ and that there are no alternatives within 0.25 LOD units of the best marker order by using the program ‘map_eval’. Subsequently, the markers that were not on the framework maps were placed by performing ‘placement <marker_data > <framework_map >’ iteratively, generating maps for all marker sets. The initial maps of each LG were ordered and oriented relative to each other by referring to the genetic map. Finally, the initial maps of each LG were joined by using the three MLE objective functions of the package to generate three candidate maps. From these three candidates, an optimal one was picked up as the final RH map by comparing the results of the program ‘quality’.This research was generously supported by grants from Japan Science and Technology Agency: a PREST grant to M.

IntroductionMammalian genomes are highly heterogeneous in base composition. These are composed of long stretches of DNA with distinct GC composition, commonly known as the isochore structures1–4 or GC-content domains.5 The local GC composition correlates with a number of important genomic features such as gene density, gene length, patterns of gene expression, repeat element distribution, recombination rate etc.6–11 Evolutionary stability of the GC-content distribution has been demonstrated for mice and humans on a genome-wide level.12 The GC-rich sequences from one genome were demonstrated to be GC rich in the other genome and vice versa. Finding such one-to-one correspondence between the local GC distribution patterns in mouse and human was, however, not trivial. Since the divergence of the rodent and primate lineages at around 84–121 million years ago,13,14 multiple substitutions might have occurred at the same sites of a pair of mouse–human orthologs independently in two lineages and if there had not been a strong directionality of the selection process(es) prevailing over the random mutation and fixation, such multiple substitutions should have randomized the local GC distribution patterns in two genomes. Invariance of the overall patterns of GC distribution along the chromosomes of mouse and human, therefore, suggests that there might be some well-defined trends in the nucleotide and/or amino acid substitution patterns across these two species. The present study was designed to determine such trends, if any.A number of efforts have been made earlier to determine the evolutionary trends in mammalian genomes, but no definite conclusion could be reached. On the basis of the analysis of orthologous gene sequences from closely related species, it has been proposed that GC-rich regions of primate and cetartiodactyl genomes are becoming GC poorer, i.e. GC-rich isochores are now vanishing in these lineages.15–18 Alvarez-Valin et al.,19 however, described the ‘vanishing isochores’ effect as an artifact created due to inaccurate reconstruction of ancestral GC levels in such studies,15 offering an evidence for an AT substitution bias within the repetitive elements of mammals. On the contrary, the maximum parsimony analysis conducted by Gu and Li20 advocated for recent enrichment of the GC content of GC-rich genes in some genomes, e.g. the rabbit. Therefore, the direction(s) of evolution of mammalian genes is a matter of conjecture. Did mammalian genes of varying GC bias follow distinct evolutionary trajectories, and if yes, to what extent could they influence the evolution of encoded proteins? In an attempt to address these questions, the present study carried out a genome-scale analysis of the trends in nucleotide and amino acid substitutions between human and mouse orthologous pairs of varying GC content. The analysis showed that indeed there exist definite trends not only in nucleotide, but also in amino acid substitution patterns between mouse and human orthologous pairs, and that these trends are, in general, highly asymmetric and polarized to the reverse directions in high-GC and low-GC sets of orthologs in such a way that in course of evolution, the compositional heterogeneity has been significantly enhanced in coding regions in human compared with that in mouse.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence retrievalNucleotide sequences of 12 405 pairs of orthologous coding regions of human and mouse were extracted from the Searchable Prototype Experimental Evolutionary Database (SPEED)21 (http://www.bioinfobase.umkc.edu/speed/), using an in-house program developed in Perl. To minimize the sampling errors, a total of 174 sequences, which were shorter than 100 codons in either organism, were excluded from the analysis. The remaining sequences were subjected to a codon integrity check using a freely available program, CodonW22 (http://www.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/cu/), and the dataset was further screened for removing redundant sequences. The final dataset of human mouse orthologs contains 12 024 nonredundant sequences. We generated corresponding nonredundant protein sequence using C program developed in-house.2.2. Classification of orthologs in three compositional groupsThe pairs of orthologous sequences under study exhibited significant correlations, not only between the overall GC contents, but also between the GC contents at third codon sites (GC3) as shown in Fig. 1A and B. These orthologs were then classified into three groups according to the GC3 contents of the human genes: the low-GC group with (GC3)Human < 50%, the medium-GC group with 50% ≤ (GC3)Human ≤ 70%, and the high-GC group with (GC3)Human > 70%. The numbers of pairs of orthologous genes in these three groups were comparable with one another (3896, 3960, and 4168 numbers in high-, medium-, and low-GC groups, respectively). The sequences in these three groups were used to examine the trends in amino acid and nucleotide substitution patterns.Scatter plot of (A) overall GC content (%) and (B) GC content at third codon sites (%) of 12 024 orthologous genes of human and mouse with their correlation coefficient values.Scatter plot of (A) overall GC content (%) and (B) GC content at third codon sites (%) of 12 024 orthologous genes of human and mouse with their correlation coefficient values.The total dataset was also classified into another three groups on the basis of GC3 contents of the mouse genes: the new low-GC group with (GC3)Mouse< 50%, the new medium-GC group with 50% ≤ (GC3)Mouse ≤ 70%, and the new high-GC group with (GC3)Mouse > 70%. The entire study carried out with the high-, medium-, and low-GC groups were re-checked with these new high-, new medium-, and new low-GC groups of orthologs.We classified the datasets on the basis of the GC3 of coding sequences rather than the overall GC, because the GC3 contents of mammalian genes are known to exhibit strong correlation with the GC content of the genomic region, where the genes are located.23,242.3. Analysis of amino acid substitution patterns: evaluation of amino acid replacement matrix (AARM) for different groups of orthologsThe alignments of orthologous sequences of three groups were created separately using the pairwise alignment program ClustalW25 and only the gap-free aligned regions of length >100 residues were considered to avoid any spurious short-alignment regions. The numbers of pairs of aligned orthologous genes in three groups of sequences with gap-free regions of length >100 residues were less than the previous set (3659, 2669, and 3291 numbers in high-, medium-, and low-GC groups, respectively). Amino acid replacements were calculated for all gap-free alignment regions of >100 residues and also for fully aligned sequences including gaps. The replacement data are represented in a 20 × 20 matrix, designated as amino acid replacement matrix (AARM), as shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3 for gap-free alignment regions of >100 residues. (To avoid confusion with the standard amino acid substitution matrices like PAM or BLOSUM, we have used the term ‘Replacement’ matrix.) The elements of AARM represent the ratio between the number of forward replacements and the number of backward replacements for any specific pairs of residues, i.e. the value of any element Rij of the AARM represents the ratio of the total number of [i]Mouse → [j]Human replacements to the number of [j]Mouse → [i]Human replacements. If Rij > 1, then there will be an overall gain in the amino acid residue j at the cost of the amino acid residue i in human compared with that in mouse. If Rij < 1, the reverse will be true. The actual number of forward and backward replacements for all possible pairs of amino acid residues for high-, medium-, and low-GC groups are given in Supplementary Table S1a–c. Other than diagonal positions of the matrices (representing the identical substitutions), all other elements represent the nonidentical substitutions. The replacement values for the gap-free alignment regions were not changed significantly from the result obtained by alignment of full sequences including gaps. In order to test whether there were any significant intra-group variations in the replacement values, subsets of 500 pairs of sequences were taken sequentially from start to end and also randomly from the entire dataset of a specific group of orthologs (i.e. high-/medium-/low-GC group) and 20 × 20 AARM was determined for each subset of sequence pairs. Comparison of the replacement values obtained from different subsets of any particular group was then carried out, and no significant variations in substitution values were found for individual residue pairs within a group. All these computations were done using Substitution Pattern Analysis Software Tool (SPAST), a program in C, developed in-house.Amino Acid Replacement Matrix (AARM) for high-GC group in human mouse orthologsEach element Rij in the AARM represents the ratio of number of replacements of the residue i by the residue j in the forward direction (mouse → human) to that in the reverse direction. This means that if Rij >1, the number of (i)Mouse → (j)Human replacements is higher than the number of (j)Mouse → (i)Human replacements and if Rij <1, the reverse is true.

Bold and Bold-italics ratios signifies the directional bias at p < 0.0001 and < 0.001 respectively.2.4. Analysis of nucleotide substitution patterns: evaluation of nucleotide replacement matrix (NRM) for three codon sites of different groups of orthologsWe created the nucleotide sequence alignments on the basis of amino acid alignments and calculated the nucleotide replacements in the form of 4 × 4 NRM, individually for three codon positions for three different groups of orthologs under study. The elements rij of NRM represent the ratio of the number of forward replacements to that of backward replacements for any specific pairs of nucleotides. Comparison of the nucleotide replacement values obtained from different subsets of 500 orthologous sequences (taken sequentially from start to end and also randomly) of any particular group was then carried out and no significant variations in replacement values were found for individual nucleotide pairs within a group.2.5. Tests for statistical significance of different elements (Rij/rij) of AARM and NRMFor a given pair of amino acids or nucleotides, the mouse to human replacement was taken as the forward direction and human to mouse as the reverse direction, and each Rij in AARM or rij in NRM represents the ratio of number of replacements of the residue i by the residue j in the forward direction (mouse to human) to that in the reverse direction (human to mouse). This means that if Rij (or rij) > 1, the number of (i)Mouse → (j)Human replacements is higher than the number of (j)Mouse → (i)Human replacements, and if Rij (or rij) < 1, the reverse is true.For each pair of replacements, the ratio of forward to reverse replacements was expected to be 1:1 under unbiased conditions. To test this hypothesis, the observed and expected numbers (based on a 1:1 ratio) were recorded for each pair of a particular group. In all cases, the Chi-square test was used to assess the significance of the directional bias, if any, at p = 0.001 and 0.0001. For each pair of replacements, the first and second rows of the 2 × 2 contingency table represented the number of replacements from one particular residue (say, i) to another (say, j) of the pair and the total count of the remaining replacements (say, k) from the residue i (where k ≠ j), respectively. The procedure was repeated also for orthologous replacements of 500 sequences taken sequentially from start to end and randomly. The significant (at p < 0.001 or 0.0001) trends for the whole dataset are also consistent with sequences taken sequentially from start to end and randomly.2.6. Correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutionCorrespondence analysis on RSCU26 was performed using the CodonW 1.4.222 program to identify the major factors influencing the variation in synonymous codon usage in three groups of orthologous sets. These analyses generate a series of orthogonal axes to identify trends that explain the variation within a dataset, with each subsequent axis explaining a decreasing amount of the variation.To examine the nucleotide substitution patterns, we estimated the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, dS, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, dN, of randomly chosen 500 pairs of ten sets of orthologs in each three groups using the MEGA program (version 2.1), as described by Nei and Gojobori.27 The values of dS, dN, and dN/dS of three orthologous groups were compared by t-test.3. Results3.1. Specific trends in amino acid substitution patterns between mouse and human orthologsIn order to investigate whether the mouse and human proteins of high-, medium-, and low-GC composition followed the same or different evolutionary trajectories since the divergence of the two species, trends in amino acid substitution between the human–mouse orthologous pairs were studied individually in three groups of genes, using the program SPAST developed in-house. Tables 1, 2, and 3 represents the AARMs for aligned regions of orthologous pairs (gap-free regions of length >100 residues at a stretch) in high-, medium-, and low-GC groups, respectively. As already mentioned, the mouse to human replacements was taken by convention as the forward direction and human to mouse as the reverse direction.For each group of orthologs, some specific amino acid pairs exhibit significant bias in the replacement patterns. For instance, in high-GC group, the value of RIG, i.e. the ratio of [Ile]Mouse → [Gly]Human to [Gly]Mouse → [Ile]Human, is 2.51 (p < 0.0001), implying that the frequency of replacement of Ile in mouse sequence with Gly in human is >2.5-fold higher than that in reverse direction, i.e. the frequency of replacement of Gly of mouse sequence with Ile in human. On the contrary, in low-GC group, RIG = 0.48, indicating that in low-GC orthologs, the frequency of substitution of Ile of mouse sequence by Gly in human is more than two-fold lower than the frequency of the reverse substitution. For the medium-GC group, the value of RIG is not statistically significant, suggesting that the frequencies of substitution of Ile by Gly and of Gly by Ile are comparable in cases of medium-GC orthologs of mouse and human.As Rij = 1/Rji, out of the 380 off-diagonal elements of an AARM (Tables 1, 2, and 3), only 190 are independent. Out of these 190 AARM elements, 53 are significantly biased in a specific direction for high-GC group (46 at p < 0.0001 and seven at p < 0.001), whereas for low-GC group, 67 elements are found to be significantly biased (56 and 11 at p < 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively). In the medium-GC group, only 15 AARM elements are statistically significant (ten at p < 0.0001 and five at p < 0.001). Some of them are shared with the high-GC group and some with the low-GC group.3.2. Significant trends in amino acid substitution in high-GC and low-GC groups are, in general, opposite to one anotherA careful examination of Tables 1, 2, and 3 reveals that when i represents a residue encoded by A/U-rich codons and j represents a residue encoded by relatively G/C-rich codons, the AARM element, Rij, in most cases (but not in all), is >1 in the high-GC group, <1 in the low-GC group, and nearly equal to ∼1 in the medium-GC group. Reverse situation occurs, in general, when i represents a residue encoded by G/C-rich codons and j by relatively A/U-rich codons. For instance, for i = Ala (A) (encoded by GCN), RAj is significantly <1 in high-GC group and significantly >1 in low-GC group for j = Ile, Asn, Lys, Ser, Thr, Val, Glu etc (encoded, respectively, by AUH, AAY, AAR, UCN/AGY, ACN, GUN, and GAR). On the contrary, for i = Asn (N) (encoded by AAY), RNj > 1 for high-GC group and <1 for low-GC group, when j = Gly or Ala or Arg (encoded by GGN, GCN, and CGN/AGR, respectively). There are altogether 33 AARM elements, which are polarized to the opposite directions (>1 and <1) in high- and low-GC groups and are found to be statistically significant in both groups.Table 4 provides the lists of the 15 amino acid pairs having the largest differences in total number of forward (mouse to human) and backward (human to mouse) substitutions between them for three different groups of orthologs under study. There are eight pairs of residues (marked with ±) that appear among the top 15 trends in both high- and low-GC groups, but with opposite directionality (Table 4). There are four other pairs of residues among the top 15 of the high-GC group (marked with +), which exhibit significant, but opposite, bias in the low-GC group (Table 4), but did not come among the top 15 in the later group. Similarly, there are also four pairs (marked with –) among the top 15 of the low-GC group, which are opposite and significant, but not among the top 15 in the high-GC group. Thus, the trends in amino acid substitutions between the mouse and human orthologs follow reverse directionality, in general, in the high- and low-GC groups. Among the top 15 trends in the medium-GC groups, some are common in directionality with high-GC group and some with the low-GC group.Top 15 amino acid pairs of three orthologous groups according to differences in number of forward (mouse to human) and reverse (human to mouse) replacements in AARM*,**Replacements of pairs are significant at p < 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively.Symbols used in codons: R, A/G; Y, C/T; S, G/C; W, A/T; H, A/C/T; N, any nucleotide.

There are six residues, viz. Phe, Tyr, Met, Ile, Asn, and Lys, which are encoded by A/U-rich codons and four residues, viz. Gly, Ala, Arg, and Pro, encoded by G/C-rich codons. As can be seen from Tables 1, 2, and 3, among the amino acid residues encoded by A/U-rich codons, Ile, Asn, and Lys have a more number of significantly biased replacement ratios (AARM elements) both in the high-GC group and in the low-GC group. Replacement ratios of Phe and Tyr, though follow the general trend, are not statistically significant in most cases. Rather, some other residues like Ser, Thr, Val, Leu etc., which are not necessarily encoded by A/U codons, exhibit significant bias in the replacement ratios (Tables 1 and 3). Similarly, among Gly, Ala, Arg, and Pro, the former two have more number of significant Rij values. Previous analysis of many prokaryotic genomes28 and high-GC rice genes with their Arabidopsis homologs29 showed that proteins encoded by GC-rich sequences are characterized by increased levels of Gly, Ala, Arg, and Pro residues and a corresponding decrease in Phe, Tyr, Met, Ile, Asn, and Lys residues. It is, therefore, intriguing to examine to what extent the overall usage of the residues Gly/Ala/Arg/Pro and that of Phe/Tyr/Met/Ile/Asn/Lys vary within the mouse and human orthologs of high-, medium- and low-GC groups. Our analysis indicates that the mouse and human orthologs of three groups are indeed characterized by distinct usage profile of these residues (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the high-GC group, the human orthologs have higher usage of Gly, Ala, Arg, and Pro and lower usages of Phe, Tyr, Met, Ile, Asn, and Lys compared with their mouse orthologs, but the differences are not as pronounced as shown previously for homologous gene pairs from the rice and Arabidopsis, having large difference in GC content.29 In the low-GC group, the reverse is true, whereas in the medium-GC group, there is no significant difference between mouse and human orthologous pairs in the usage of these two groups of residues.3.3. (Asp)Mouse → (Glu)Human trend in all groups of orthologs irrespective of their GC contentThere is only one replacement ratio RDE, which exhibits same directionality and almost the same value in all three AARMs (Tables 1, 2, and 3), indicating that in all groups of orthologs, the frequency of (Asp)Mouse→ (Glu)Human replacements is slightly higher than the replacement in the opposite direction. As the Asp → Glu replacement is among the top 15 trends in substitution in all three groups (Table 4), it is one of the most common trends in amino acid replacement in mouse–human orthologs. These observations suggest that irrespective of the GC content of the encoding genes, there has been a consistent increase in glutamic acid in human proteins at the cost of aspartic acid compared with their mouse orthologs. The structural and/or functional implications of this unique evolutionary trend is, however, not clear. There are two other substitution trends, Ser → Thr and Phe → Tyr, which also exhibit same directionality in all three groups under study, but the replacement values are not statistically significant for the high-GC group.3.4. High-GC orthologs are biased towards (A/T)Mouse → (G/C)Human replacements, whereas in low-GC orthologs, (G/C)Mouse → (A/T)Human replacements prevailAs already emphasized, the major trends in amino acid replacements between mouse and human orthologs (Tables 1–4) indicate that in the high-GC group, the amino acid residues encoded by relatively GC-rich codons tend to increase in human proteins compared with mouse orthologs, and in the low-GC group, the reverse trends prevail. In the medium-GC-group, however, there is no such specific directionality in codon substitution patterns. These observations have prompted us to examine the trends in nucleotide substitution patterns individually in three codon positions in three groups of orthologs. As can be seen from the NRMs shown in Table 5, in the high-GC dataset, rij, is significantly greater than 1, when i = A or T and j = G or C. On the contrary, rij is significantly less than 1, when i = G or C and j = A or T. These trends are valid in all three codon positions, although the deviation of rij from 1 (for a particular set of m and n) is highest in third codon positions, followed by the first and second codon positions. Therefore, in the high-GC group, there has been an excess of (A/T)Mouse → (G/C)Human replacements over (G/C)Mouse → (A/T)Human at each codon position individually. For the low-GC group, the reverse situation has been encountered (Table 5), i.e. there is a tendency for G and C in mouse genes to be replaced by A or T in their human orthologs, the bias being maximal at the third codon positions. For the medium-GC group, however, no significant difference between (A/T)Mouse → (G/C)Human and (G/C)Mouse → (A/T)Human replacements could be observed at the first and second codon sites, whereas for the third codon sites, the (A)Mouse → (G)Human and (T)Mouse → (C)Human replacements dominate over the reverse replacements. These observations imply that for the high-GC group, either the GC content tends to increase in human genes relative to mouse or tends to decrease in mouse genes relative to human, whereas for low-GC group, either there is a trend in relative decrease in GC content in human compared with mouse or there is a trend in relative increase in GC content in mouse compared with human. This suggests that with time, there is a relative increase in compositional heterogeneity within human genes compared with that within mouse genes or decrease in compositional heterogeneity within mouse genes compared with that within human genes.Nucleotide replacement matrices at (NRMs) three codon positions for human mouse orthologs of high-, medium-, and low-GC groups under studyEach element rij in the NRM represents the ratio of number of replacements of the nucleotide i by the nucleotide j in the forward direction (mouse to human) to that in the reverse direction. This means that if rij > 1, the number of (i)Mouse → (j)Human replacements is higher than the number of (j)Mouse → (i)Human replacements and if rij < 1, the reverse is true. Bold and bold-italics ratios signifies the directional bias at p < 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively.Nucleotide replacement matrices at (NRMs) three codon positions for human mouse orthologs of high-, medium-, and low-GC groups under studyEach element rij in the NRM represents the ratio of number of replacements of the nucleotide i by the nucleotide j in the forward direction (mouse to human) to that in the reverse direction. This means that if rij > 1, the number of (i)Mouse → (j)Human replacements is higher than the number of (j)Mouse → (i)Human replacements and if rij < 1, the reverse is true. Bold and bold-italics ratios signifies the directional bias at p < 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively.Our next task was to see to what extent the observed trends in nucleotide substitution patterns have affected the relative GC divergence between mouse and human orthologs. To this end, the number of genes was plotted against their GC12 and GC3 values both for mouse and for human in all three groups of orthologs (Fig. 2) using STATISTICA (version 6.0). In all cases, normal distributions were obtained (Fig. 2). In high-GC group, both GC12 and GC3 distributions in human are skewed towards right (increasing GC contents) compared with mouse (Fig. 2A and B), but for low-GC group, the reverse is true (Fig. 2E and F). The extent of inter-species divergence in GC distribution is much more apparent in case of third codon positions (Fig. 2B, D, and F) compared with the first and second positions (Fig. 2A, C, and E). For medium-GC orthologs, medians of both GC12 and GC3 distributions are almost same in both species under study (Fig. 2C and D). These observations imply that the intra-species divergence in base composition is higher in case of human genes than that in their mouse orthologs such that among the GC-rich pairs of orthologs, human coding sequences are usually higher in GC content than their mouse counterparts, but among the GC-poor orthologous pairs, human coding sequences are, in general, lower in GC content than the respective mouse sequences.Left panel: distribution of GC content at first and second codon positions among human (blue) and mouse (red) orthologous genes for (A) high-, (C) medium-, and (E) low-GC group with their normal distributions. Right panel: distribution of GC content at third codon position among human and mouse orthologous genes for (B) high-, (D) medium-, and (F) low-GC group with their normal distributions.Left panel: distribution of GC content at first and second codon positions among human (blue) and mouse (red) orthologous genes for (A) high-, (C) medium-, and (E) low-GC group with their normal distributions. Right panel: distribution of GC content at third codon position among human and mouse orthologous genes for (B) high-, (D) medium-, and (F) low-GC group with their normal distributions.3.5. Multivariate analysis of synonymous codon usage confirms opposite trends in high-GC and low-GC groups of orthologsThe skewness of GC3 in human genes towards increasing GC in high-GC group and decreasing GC in low-GC group compared with mouse orthologs (Fig. 2B, D, and F) has also been reflected in the COA of RSCU. Fig. 3A–C represents axis-1 versus axis-2 plot of the COA on RSCU of genes in three different groups. In all cases, axis-1 exhibits strong negative correlation with GC content at synonymous substitution sites (GC3S). The distribution of human and mouse genes along axis-1 confirms that in high-GC group (Fig. 3A), human genes exhibit higher usage of G or C ending synonymous codons compared with their mouse orthologs, whereas for low-GC group, the reverse trend dominates (Fig. 3C). For medium-GC group, as expected, usage of G/C-ending codons is comparable in mouse and human (Fig. 3B).Positions of orthologous gene pairs between human and mouse along the first two identical principal axes generated by COA on RSCU values of (A) 3896 genes from high-GC group, (B) 3960 genes from medium-GC group, and (C) 4168 genes from low-GC group. The filled quadrangle and open quadrangle represent genes from mouse and human orthologous genes, respectively.Positions of orthologous gene pairs between human and mouse along the first two identical principal axes generated by COA on RSCU values of (A) 3896 genes from high-GC group, (B) 3960 genes from medium-GC group, and (C) 4168 genes from low-GC group. The filled quadrangle and open quadrangle represent genes from mouse and human orthologous genes, respectively.It is worth mentioning that the GC contents of the synonymous substitution sites in the mouse and human orthologous pairs exhibit negative correlations in all three groups (supplement-I). These observations are in accordance with the previous report by Takahashi and Nakashima.303.6. Rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions are same in all three groups of orthologsIn order to examine whether the rate of nucleotide substitution between mouse and human orthologs varies in three different groups, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, dS, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, dN, were estimated for randomly selected 500 pairs of the orthologs from each group. The value of dS remains almost same in all three groups (data not shown). The value of dN apparently seems to be lower in the medium-GC group, but its difference with its values for the other two groups is not statistically significant. These observations indicate that although the trends in nucleotide substitutions are polarized to the opposite directions in the high- and low-GC groups of orthologs, the rates of synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions did not vary with the GC bias of the genes.4. DiscussionSince the divergence of the rodent and primate lineages, multiple substitutions might have occurred at the same site of a pair of mouse–human orthologs independently in two lineages. Had there not been a strong directionality of selection process(es) prevailing over the random mutational events, such multiple hits should have obscured the true pattern of substitution, if any, between such orthologous pairs. However, the present study has revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid substitution patterns in mouse–human orthologs have followed definite trends that are highly asymmetric and polarized to opposite directions in high- and low-GC groups, suggesting that indeed there has been a definite directionality in gene/protein evolution towards increasing compositional divergence in human protein-coding regions compared with that in mouse protein-coding regions or towards decreasing compositional divergence in mouse protein-coding regions compared with that in human protein-coding regions. It is true that the GC content shows evolutionary stability between mouse and human, i.e. orthologs have similar GC contents in two species, but among the high-GC orthologs, human proteins are slightly higher in GC content than their mouse orthologs, whereas among the low-GC orthologs, human proteins are slightly higher in AT content than their mouse counterparts.A question may be raised at this point: why, of all mammalian species, only mouse and human were chosen as the species of study in the present report. The reason is as follows: initially we intended to analyze the sequence divergence patterns between the orthologous coding regions of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus monkey. However, the numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions between two orthologs of any two primate species were often too low to reveal any significant statistical trend. Therefore, we have decided to analyze the trends in substitution patterns between a rodent and a primate species, mouse and human have been chosen as the representative species of the two lineages.As already mentioned in Section 2, the trends reported here are robust enough to be valid for any subset of the total datasets of orthologous sequences. Any trend in amino acid/nucleotide replacement between the pairs of orthologs of a particular dataset remains invariant, in general, when a subset of sequences are chosen randomly from that particular dataset. This indicates that same trends are usually followed individually by each pair of orthologs in a particular group (high-, medium-, or low-GC group).The trends in amino acid and nucleotide replacement patterns also remained same when the orthologous sequences were classified in high-, medium-, and low-GC groups on the basis of the GC3 content of mouse genes instead of human genes. The same previous directionality was observed for high- or low-GC groups, i.e. GC content either increase in human genes relative to mouse or decrease in mouse genes relative to human for the high-GC group, whereas for low-GC group, either there is relative decrease in GC content in human genes compared with mouse gene or relative increase in GC content in mouse genes compared with human gene. This was, however, expected as the two genome sequences exhibit a one-to-one correspondence in their local GC content.The only significant trend common in all three groups of orthologs is (Asp)Mouse → (Glu)Human. Surprisingly, the value of RDE is almost same in all three groups and the trend has also been exhibited by the subsets chosen randomly from the whole dataset of any particular compositional group. This indicates that this trend, in general, does not alter with the compositional bias or functional characteristics of the genes. In accordance with this, average frequency of Glu (7.01% for mouse and 7.11% for human) is significantly higher in human (p < 10−5) and that of Asp (4.90% for mouse and 4.81% for human) is significantly higher in mouse (p < 10−5). The structural consequence of this trend is, however, not clear.No significant differences could be observed between the synonymous or nonsynonymous substitution rates in three groups of orthologs under study. This suggests that although the directionality of evolution in orthologs of two extreme GC compositions is oppositely polarized, the rate at which they evolve is almost same in both cases.In a nutshell, the present study indicates that in comparison with mouse, the coding regions of the human genome have experienced an expansion, not shrinkage, in intra-species heterogeneity in local GC content. This observation, however, does not warrant the relative expansion of the human GC islands as a whole, since it would depend not only on the evolutionary trends of the coding region, but also on those of the noncoding regions. One should also remember that a relative increase in GC heterogeneity in human orthologs compared with mouse orthologs not necessarily implies an absolute increase in GC heterogeneity in human coding regions with evolution. In absolute sense, both human and mouse might have evolved towards decreasing compositional heterogeneity, the rate of decrease in heterogeneity being less in human than in mouse, or alternatively, both the species might be evolving towards increasing intra-species inhomogeneity, the rate of increase being higher in human relative to mouse.FundingCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (Project No. CMM 0017 to C.D and S.G); Department of Biotechnology, Government of India (BT/BI/04/055-2001 to S.K.B and S.P).We are grateful to Dr. A.

These findings suggest that DnaA plays several additional roles, such as control of the level of effective initiator, ATP-DnaA, and/or stabilization of the domain structure of the genome around oriC for the proper initiation of chromosome replication.1. IntroductionThe replication initiation protein of eubacteria, DnaA, binds to an asymmetrical 9 bp consensus sequence (TTATNCACA, DnaA box) that is repeated several times in the replication origin (oriC) region, and plays a central role in the formation of the initiation complex for chromosome replication (reviewed by Leonard and Grimwade,1 Kaguni,2 Mott and Berger,3 and Zakrzewska-Czerwinska et al.4). Additionally, the protein autogenously represses its own expression to maintain the cellular level through binding to DnaA boxes downstream of the dnaA promoter in Escherichia coli,5Bacillus subtilis,6Streptomyces lividance,7Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. bovis.8 The timing of chromosome replication initiation is tightly regulated, and involves the cellular DnaA level in E. coli (reviewed by Kaguni2), B. subtilis6 and M. smegmatis.9 However, the DnaA box sequence is not restricted to the oriC and dnaA promoter regions. A search for the consensus sequence, TTATNCACA, allowing a one base mismatch along the complete genome sequence of E. coli and B. subtilis, reveals the existence of 3742 and 4342 sites, respectively.Indeed, several genes are possibly or conclusively regulated directly by DnaA in E. coli (reviewed by Messer and Weigel).10 DnaA negatively regulates mioC, rpoH, uvrB, and proS,5,11,12 and positively regulates polA expression.13 Levels of mioC and polA are controlled in a growth phase-dependent manner, and DnaA possibly contributes to the coupling of expression to growth rate.13–15 A recent study proposes that repression of nrdAB expression by ATP-bound DnaA is associated with coupling of the initiation frequency to elongation rate of chromosome replication,16 although DnaA has been demonstrated previously to regulate positively nrdAB promoter.17 DnaA might have a dual role in modulating nrdAB expression; low levels of DnaA-ATP stimulate the transcription whereas high levels repress it.18 In addition, a high-affinity DnaA-binding sequence containing five DnaA boxes, dat (DnaA Titration), has been identified.19 Multicopy plasmids harboring the dat sequence interfere with the normal replication cycle, although its exact role is unclear.20 A similar high-affinity DnaA-binding region is involved in regulating the initiation of chromosome replication in S. coelicolor.21 In B. subtilis, DnaA functions in repressing the initiation of sporulation in actively replicating cells by controlling the expression of Sda that blocks the signal transduction cascade leading to sporulation.22,23 The sequence upstream of the sda promoter includes five DnaA boxes, and DnaA binding to these is essential for sda expression. Transcriptome analysis of replication-inhibited cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that yllB (ftsL), dnaB, ywlC, and yydA are negatively regulated by DnaA binding to their promoter regions,23 suggesting that the protein is involved in tolerance against replication stress as a transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, DnaA acts as a transcriptional regulator in Caulobacter crescentus.24,25 In this case, DnaA stimulates the expression of a master regulator of cell cycle progression, gcrA, which in turn activates multiple genes, including those involved in chromosome replication and segregation, coordinating the initiation of chromosome replication and cell cycle progression.Thus, in addition to the initiation of replication and autoregulation of its expression, DnaA appears to participate in the coordination between initiation of chromosome replication and cell cycle progression. However, genome-wide identification of DnaA-binding sites in vivo has not yet been attempted. ChIP-chip analysis, a powerful tool for monitoring the distribution of genome-associated proteins in vivo, employs chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with a high-resolution oligonucleotide tiling chip.26 For instance, we and other groups recently reported the distribution of nucleoid-associated protein, H-NS, on the E. coli and Salmonella genomes, and found that H-NS preferentially binds to and represses horizontally acquired genes.27–29 However, ChIP-chip analysis requires a specific antibody that efficiently recognizes the target protein in protein–DNA complexes, which may limit its applicability. Previously, we developed a method to isolate protein complexes with high purity, using a 12 × Histidine-tag under denatured conditions.30 To improve versatility, this procedure was adapted for the purification of protein–DNA complexes, denoted ChAP-chip (Chromatin Affinity Precipitation coupled with high density tiling chip). The binding sites of Spo0J determined with the modified technique were consistent with previous reports.31 Clearly, DnaA forms stable complexes at eight intergenic regions on the B. subtilis genome, including oriC, oriC1, and oriC2. Characterization of the DnaA-binding sequences revealed that two factors—local density of the DnaA boxes and their affinities to DnaA—are critical for stable binding. Thus, filament formation of multiple ATP-bound DnaA proposed for the bacterial oriC–DnaA complex32 might occur at the stable-binding sites. In combination with transcriptome analysis of cells containing increased or decreased DnaA amounts, our data show that DnaA proteins stably associated with target DNA directly regulate the expression of sda in a positive manner, and ywlC and yydA in a negative manner. Examination of possible stable DnaA-binding sequences in genome sequences of other Bacillus species suggested that DnaA-dependent regulation of those genes is maintained in most of bacteria examined, supporting their biological significance. In addition, a possible stable DnaA-binding site downstream of gcp is also suggested to be conserved. Furthermore, potential DnaA-binding sequences specific for each bacterium have been identified, generally in close proximity to the oriC region. These findings suggest that DnaA plays several additional roles, such as control of the level of effective initiator, ATP-DnaA, and/or stabilization of the domain structure of the genome around oriC for the proper initiation of chromosome replication.2. Materials and methods2.1. Design of the B. subtilis tiling chipWe retrieved the B. subtilis genome sequence and other genetic information from the SubtiList database (http://genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/) for the design of probes, according to the Affymetrix guidelines. Probe sequences were selected for protein coding and intergenic regions using different criteria.27 Apart from the rrnA operon, rRNA genes were excluded from probe design. In addition, skin element, two prophage (PNSX and spβ), and seven prophage-like sequences33 were excluded. The tRNA genes and those encoding proteins with lengths of <100 amino acids were taken as intergenic regions. As a result, 55 430 25-mer sequences on the coding strand were selected for protein coding regions at 25–30 bp intervals, and 72 218 sequences on both strands were selected for intergenic regions at 2–3 bp intervals. In total, 127 648 probe sets (perfect match and mismatch probes) were synthesized on the chip. Chip probe information is available on our website (http://genome.naist.jp/bacteria/array/ecol.html).2.2. Construction of strains expressing C-terminally histidine-tagged proteinsPrimers used for generating plasmids used in this study are presented in Supplementary Table S1.To construct the pMUTinHis-▵spo0J plasmid, a 250 bp fragment encompassing the 3′-region of the spo0J gene (except the stop codon) was amplified by PCR from B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA using the primer set, spo0J.f–spo0J.r, and cloned between EcoRI–XhoI sites of pMUTinHis.30 The resultant plasmid was integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome by single crossover to generate B. subtilis strains expressing C-terminal histidine-tagged Spo0J (strain SI002).The dnaA gene constitutes an operon with the downstream dnaN gene and the intergenic region (oriC2) acts as the B. subtilis oriC, together with a sequence upstream of dnaA (oriC1).34 We generated a strain expressing C-terminal histidine-tagged DnaA without plasmid integration between dnaA and dnaN (strain SI003), as schematically shown in Fig. 1. A DNA fragment containing the 3′-region of dnaA, except the stop codon, was amplified using the primers, 1dnaAHiF and 1dnaALinkR, with a partial 12 × Histidine (His-tag) coding sequence (dnaA-side fragment). A fragment containing the His-tag, followed by the stop codon of dnaA and its 500 bp downstream sequence (dnaN-side fragment) was generated by two-step adaptor PCR, using the primer sets, 2dnaAHisF–2dnaABaR, for initial amplification, and Linker12His–2dnaABaR, for the second PCR. The two fragments were ligated by recombinant PCR using the 1dnaAHiF–2dnaABaR primer set, and cloned within HindIII and BamHI sites of pMUTinNC.35 Since the dnaN gene essential for cell growth was placed under control of the IPTG-inducible spac promoter in the resultant transformants, pMUTinAhisN was used for transformation of B. subtilis 168 by single crossover with selection on LB medium containing 0.5 µg/ml erythromycin and 1 mM IPTG (first step in Fig. 1B). To induce a second recombination event for removal of the integrated plasmid, the resultant strain was cultured in competent medium containing 1 mM IPTG. Cells that grew in the absence of IPTG were selected on LB medium without erythromycin and IPTG (second step in Fig. 1B). Cells with insertion of the His-tag sequence were selected from IPTG-independent and erythromycin-sensitive colonies by examining amplification using primers complementary to the His-tag sequence (Linker12His) and a dnaN coding sequence (2dnaAbaR), and chromosomal DNA extracted from these colonies. Finally, we confirmed the addition of the 12 × His coding sequence at the 3′ end of dnaA and removal of integrated plasmid by sequencing and the resultant strain expressing the His-tagged DnaA was designated SI003. Negligible changes if any in synchrony of initiation of chromosome replication in SI003 cells were confirmed by flow cytometory (Supplementary Fig. S1).Schematic representation of the generation of strain SI003.

On the other hand, recombination at region e or f in cells with structure 2 resulted in cells having structure 4 or 3, respectively. Cells displaying structure 4 were selected for ChAP-chip analysis.Schematic representation of the generation of strain SI003.

ChAP-chip analysisAn overnight culture of B. subtilis cells expressing histidine-tagged protein in LB liquid medium at 37°C was inoculated into 400 mL LB medium to obtain an initial OD600 value of 0.01. During SI002 culture at 37°C, 0.5 µg/mL erythromycin and 1 mM IPTG were added at every step. At OD600 of 0.4, the culture was treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 30 min. Cells were washed with TBS buffer (pH 7.5), and stored at −80°C until use. Next, cells were disrupted by sonication on ice in 3 mL of UT buffer (100 mM HEPES, 50 mM imidazole, 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, 200 µL of MagneHis (Promega) was added to the supernatant, followed by overnight incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. MagneHis was washed five times with UT buffer, and bound proteins eluted with 400 µL of elution buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M imidazole, 1% SDS, 10 mM DTT). The eluate was passed through Microcon-100 (Millipore) to remove non-specifically bound uncrossed-linked proteins with a molecular mass lower than 100 kDa. Protein complexes retained on the membrane were washed three times with wash buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 10 mM DTT), and recovered by the addition of 50 µL buffer. Cross-links were dissociated by heating at 65°C overnight, and DNA purified using Qiaquick (QIAGEN).Terminal labeling of purified DNA fragments and hybridization to the oligonucleotide chip were performed essentially as described previously.27 Signal intensities of mismatch probes were subtracted from those of perfect match probes. The signal intensities of DNA in the affinity-purified fraction and those of DNA isolated from the whole cell extract fraction before purification (control DNA) were adjusted to confer a signal average of 500. Signal intensities of DNA in the affinity-purified fraction were subtracted by those of control DNA to obtain protein-binding signals. The distribution of protein-binding signals along the genome coordinate was visualized with the In Silico Molecular Cloning program, Array Edition (In Silico Biology).2.4. High-resolution transcriptome analysisNIS2022 cells harboring the IPTG-inducible dnaA–dnaN operon at the purA locus6 were pre-cultured overnight at 30°C on a PAB plate containing 5 µg/ml tetracycline and 10 µg/ml neomycin, with or without 10 µM IPTG. Cells were inoculated into PAB liquid medium with or without 0.1 M IPTG to obtain an initial OD600 value of 0.01, followed by culture at 30°C. At OD600 of 0.4, cells were harvested from 40 mL of culture, and total RNA extracted, as described previously.36 Expression of DnaA protein in wild-type CRK6000 cells and NIS2022 cells was confirmed by western blotting using a specific antibody, based on an earlier protocol.6 Synthesis of cDNA, terminal labeling, and hybridization to the oligonucleotide chip were performed using established methods.27 Amplification of cDNA was avoided to allow the coding strands of each transcript to be distinguished. To compensate for the differences in hybridization efficiency of each 25-mer probe on the chip, we divided the hybridization intensities of cDNA synthesized from total RNA by those of total genome DNA. The distribution of transcriptional signals along the genome coordinate was visualized with the In Silico Molecular Cloning program, Array Edition (In Silico Biology).3. Results3.1. Accurate mapping of known Spo0J-binding sites by ChAP-chip analysisPreviously, we developed a method to purify in vivo complexes of cell division proteins using a 12 × histidine- tag under denatured conditions.30 We anticipated that the procedure is similarly effective for the purification of in vivo DNA–protein complexes. To verify the sensitivity of the tag-based chromatin precipitation protocol, we initially examined the binding sites of Spo0J involved in chromosome partitioning in B. subtilis. Spo0J binds at eight specific positions (parS sites) on the genome, as observed from the identified binding consensus sequences and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis.31 We expressed the Spo0J protein fused to a histidine tag at the C-terminus using SI002 cells. During exponential growth in LB medium under aerobic conditions, Spo0J-12 × His-expressing cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein and genome DNA, and disrupted by sonication in 8 M urea buffer to generate an average DNA fragment size of ∼500 bp. Protein–DNA complexes were purified with the Ni2+-resin under denatured conditions, and the cross-links removed by heat treatment. DNA fragments co-purified with Spo0J were hybridized with a high-density tiling chip. The hybridization intensities of Spo0J-associated DNA to each oligonucleotide probe on the chip are presented in Fig. 2 (see also detailed map in Supplementary Fig. S2). Our ChAP-chip analysis clearly shows that Spo0J forms a stable complex at eight regions, consistent with previous results.31 Spo0J-binding signals are more broadly distributed than those of DnaA, as described below (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2). This result is consistent with the recent finding that Spo0J is associated with several kilobases of DNA flanking its specific binding sites (parS) through a parS-dependent nucleation event that promotes lateral spreading along the chromosome.37 Thus, it appears that our ChAP-chip method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the in vivo interaction sites of DNA-binding proteins.DNA-binding profiles of Spo0J and DnaA proteins on the B. subtilis genome revealed using ChAP-chip analysis. (A) Spo0J (inner blue bars) and DnaA-binding (outer red bars) signals for each 25-mer probe on the chip were calculated by subtracting signal intensities of control DNA from those of DNA in the affinity-purified fraction, and shown at their corresponding genome coordinates. 0J1–0J8 correspond to the sites previously determined by Lin and Grossman.31 DnaA boxes are specified as colored vertical lines under DnaA-binding signals: TTATCCACA: red, TTATACACA, TTATAGACA, and TTATATACA: blue, other DnaA boxes having one base mismatch: orange.

The arrangement of genes (thick arrows), DnaA-boxes (as in A), and Spo0J binding site (parS site, purple vertical line) are shown schematically at the bottom.3.2. Identification of high-affinity binding sites of DnaATo identify the DnaA-binding sites on the B. subtilis genome, DnaA was expressed as a fusion protein with a 12 × histidine-tag by the authentic promoter using SI003 cells, and ChAP-chip analysis performed. The hybridization profiles of DnaA-associated DNA clearly disclose eight stable binding sites for DnaA on the B. subtilis genome (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, binding sites are mapped only in the intergenic regions (between rpmH–dnaA, dnaA–dnaN, yqeG–sda, ywlB–ywlC, jag–thdF, yycS–yydA, ywcI–vpr, and gcp–ydiF). Gene organization surrounding the eight binding sites, location of the DnaA boxes, and detailed DnaA-binding signals are depicted in Fig. 3, and the functions of the surrounding genes are summarized in Table 1. The regions upstream and downstream of dnaA, rpmH–dnaA (oriC1), and dnaA–dnaN (oriC2) comprise cis-acting sequences essential for the initiation of chromosome replication,34 and the upstream sequence contains the dnaA promoter that is repressed by the corresponding translated protein.6 Expression of sda is dependent on DnaA binding to the upstream sequence,22,23 and promoters of ywlC and yydA were reported to be negatively regulated by DnaA.23 Multiple DnaA boxes upstream of thdF were identified 17 years ago,38 but with no evidence of actual DnaA binding. Our results additionally suggest a possibility that DnaA regulates the expression of vpr and/or ywcI–secT. Binding to the gcp–ydiF region is uncharacteristic for transcriptional regulation, as it is located at the 3′ end of convergent gcp and ydiF genes.Local DNA-binding profiles of DnaA. Local DNA binding profiles of DnaA are presented, together with genes and DnaA boxes. DnaA boxes are specified as vertical lines under DnaA-binding signals: TTATCCACA: bold lines, TTATACACA, TTATAGACA and TTATATACA: gray lines, other DnaA boxes having one base mismatch: dotted lines. The top, middle, and bottom lines of ChAP-chip signals indicate signal intensities of 4000, 0, and −500, respectively. Closed boxes represent regions having high-affinity successive DnaA box clusters, as described in Table 2.Local DNA-binding profiles of DnaA.

These results suggest that the ChAP-chip analysis can be effectively used to detect stable DnaA–DNA complexes, but not transient or weak binding to dispersed DnaA boxes.3.3. Effect of DnaA overproduction and depletion on transcription of genes surrounding the stable binding sitesTo establish the function of DnaA binding to sequences other than oriC, we examined transcriptional profiles in DnaA-overproducing and -depleted cells using the high-density tiling chip employed for ChAP-chip analysis. To this end, we employed NIS2022 cells with an IPTG-inducible dnaA–dnaN operon at the purA locus, and inactivated the authentic dnaA gene by introducing orcher mutations.6 Expression of the DnaA protein in NIS2022 cells is reduced to One-fifth that in non-induced conditions (0 µM IPTG), and increases fivefold upon induction with 100 µM IPTG, compared with the DnaA concentration in wild-type cells.6 Notably, under both non-induced and induced conditions, no apparent growth defects were observed, and the overall profiles of gene expression remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S3). Transcriptional initiation from the authentic promoter of dnaA is clearly repressed upon induction of DnaA expression, and stimulated slightly under non-induced conditions (Fig. 4A). This finding is in agreement with a previous study reporting autoregulation of dnaA.6 A similar change in transcription was observed for the intergenic region between dnaA and dnaN. The dependence of sda expression on DnaA is well characterized.22,23 We observed sda expression and repression in DnaA-induced and non-induced conditions, respectively (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, we identified another transcript covering the sda gene, but on the non-coding strand. The newly identified transcript was weakly, but significantly repressed by overexpressed DnaA at the DnaA-binding site. We additionally observed weak, but significant repression of ywlC, yydA, and thdF-gidA-gidB-noc transcription in DnaA-induced cells (Fig. 4C–E), although their de-repression in non-induced cells was not apparent. A sufficient amount of DnaA is present in cells to support growth at a normal rate, even under non-induced conditions, thus those genes may still be repressed by DnaA. The suppression of ywlC and yydA expression by DnaA is in accordance with reported microarray data.23 We have demonstrated DnaA-regulated expression of thdF-gidA-gidB-noc by northern blot analysis using NIS2022 cells (Ogura et al., unpublished result). These transcriptional alterations were reproducible in two independent experiments (Supplementary Fig. S3). Additionally, the DnaA level affected rocA, rocD, and yvdCD expression positively, and ykuNOP and dhbA expression negatively (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2). The molecular mechanisms and biological significance of these changes are currently unclear. On the other hand, the effects of DnaA on the expression of genes around ywcI–vpr and gcp–ydiF could not be distinguished due to weak expression.Transcriptional changes around the DnaA-binding regions in dnaA-induced and repressed cells. Transcriptional activity of NIS2022 cells in the absence and presence of 100 µM IPTG and wild-type cells were analyzed using tiling chip. Transcriptional signals for each probe were calculated by dividing hybridization intensities of cDNA synthesized from total RNA by those of total genome DNA, and shown by vertical blue bars at their corresponding genome coordinates, for regions surrounding the DnaA-binding sites. Signal intensities of probes on Watson (+) and Crick (−) strands were shown separately to indicate the direction of transcripts. The DnaA-binding signals (DnaA ChAP-chip) and location of genes and DnaA boxes are also shown, as in Fig. 2B. The transcriptional start sites, dnaA and sda, determined previously, are highlighted in the genetic maps with arrows. Possible termination signals of transcription are additionally specified. Signals marked by a bold underline in panel A are due to the expression of dnaA–dnaN placed at the purA locus in NIS2022 cells.Transcriptional changes around the DnaA-binding regions in dnaA-induced and repressed cells.

Sequence characteristics of stable DnaA-binding sites on the chromosomeNext, we explored the characteristics defining the stable DnaA-binding sites in the B. subtilis genome. Bacillus subtilis DnaA recognizes DnaA boxes in E. coli oriC, and vice versa, in vitro. Although the numbers and arrangement of DnaA boxes in oriC are different in B. subtilis and E. coli, the oriC regions were incompatible with each other in vivo.39,40 Recently, the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of E. coli DnaA complexed with a DnaA box (TTATCCACA) was resolved.41 In the complex, amino acids R399, P423, D433, H434, T435, and H439 form base-specific interactions, and are essential for sequence recognition by DnaA. Interestingly, these residues are conserved in B. subtilis DnaA, indicating that DNA-binding specificities are similar for B. subtilis and E. coli DnaA. Thus, we assume that the consensus sequence of the B. subtilis DnaA box is TTATNCACA, similar to the E. coli protein, and allow one base mismatch for identifying DnaA boxes. As shown in Fig. 3, stable DnaA-binding sites contain multiple boxes, as observed in oriC sequences of eubacteria.42 Initially, we evaluated the density of DnaA boxes along the genome, using a modified method of0 Mackiewicz et al.42 The density of DnaA box distribution was presented on charts as b = 1/d, calculated for each box, where d is the average distance between adjacent DnaA boxes. Mackiewicz and colleagues calculated the b value for three successive DnaA boxes (average of two distances), whereas we additionally calculated for four and five successive boxes, with no clear correlation with the identified binding sites. Recently, the DnaA-binding affinity to DnaA boxes with different fifth nucleotides was evaluated in E. coli cells and the affinity was found to decrease in the order: C > A = G > T.43 Accordingly, we assigned the binding affinities as 4, 2, 1.5, 1, and 1 for TTATCCACA, TTATACACA, TTATAGACA, TTATATACA, and other DnaA boxes (having one base mismatch from TTATNCACA), and the binding affinity of DnaA for four successive DnaA boxes was expressed as A = (sum of affinities of four successive DnaA boxes)/d. As the result, we found that the A value is well correlated with the DnaA-binding sites; eight binding sites identified here exclusively have A value >0.3 (Fig. 5A). Sequence characteristics of the eight DnaA-binding regions, including number of DnaA boxes and the A value, are summarized in Table 2. Our results suggest that two factors, specifically, closely clustered DnaA boxes of probably four or more, and the affinity of DnaA boxes for the protein, are essential for stable DnaA-binding in B. subtilis cells.Estimation of the distribution of the possible DnaA-binding regions in genome sequences of the Bacillus species. The A value [(sum of affinities of four successive DnaA boxes)/d (average distance of adjacent DnaA boxes)] was calculated for all DnaA boxes, and plotted (closed circles joined by line) at corresponding genome coordinates in B. subtilis (A), B. licheniformis (B), B. halodurans (C), B. anthracis (D), B. thuringiensis (E), B. cereus (F), B. clausii (G), Geobacillus kaustophilus (H), and Oceanobacillus iheyensis (I).

Distribution of probable DnaA-binding sites in other Bacillus speciesWe estimated the stable DnaA-binding sites in the genome sequences of other Bacillus species, using the defined A value. Interestingly, regions with high A values locate in a similar arrangement on the genome in all the bacteria examined (Fig. 5B–I). However, close examination of possible DnaA-binding regions in various Bacillus species revealed their conserved and diverse characteristics (Table 3). As expected, multiple DnaA-binding sequences upstream and downstream of dnaA (oriC) are essentially conserved in all bacteria. Notably, in B. licheniformis, the dnaA–dnaN region contains only three DnaA boxes, and its A value is below the threshold. DnaA-binding sequences upstream of sda, ywlC, and yydA are also present in most bacteria, supporting the biological significance of DnaA-mediated regulation of these genes. Interestingly, a DnaA box cluster downstream of gcp is highly conserved, although its biological role is not clear at present. On the other hand, DnaA box cluster upstream of the thdF-gidA-gidB-noc operon is not conserved, although those genes are conserved in all bacteria examined (Table 3), thus the DnaA-dependent expression of the operon appears not to be general. Similarly, DnaA box clusters upstream of vpr are present in limited bacteria. In addition, other possible DnaA-binding regions (colored red in Fig. 5B–I) that are absent in B. subtilis have been identified. Interestingly, DnaA-binding regions with a high A value are generally located near oriC in all the bacteria examined.Conservation of DnaA-binding sequences identified in B. subtilis and adjacent genes in genome sequences of Bacillus spicesSymbols indicate conservation of genes.

DiscussionIn this study, we developed a ChAP-chip method, based on our original protocol for the purification of protein complexes.30 The binding sites of Spo0J determined using this technique were consistent with those reported earlier,31,37 clearly indicating that the ChAP-chip methods are sufficiently sensitive for the genome-wide determination of specific binding sites of DNA-binding proteins. Using this method, we have successfully visualized the distribution of RNA polymerase core enzyme and associated factors, SigA, NusA, and GreA (unpublished results). Thus, the ChAP-chip assay should be effective for proteins that are both stably and dynamically associated with genome DNA.The initiator protein of chromosomal replication, DnaA, forms stable complexes at eight intergenic regions on the B. subtilis genome, including the oriC sequences, oriC1 and oriC2. In vitro assays demonstrate that DnaA protein binds to a single DnaA box.39,40 However, characterization of the DNA sequences bound to DnaA in vivo reveals that the presence of densely clustered DnaA boxes and affinity of these boxes for DnaA protein are critical factors for stable DNA–protein interactions in vivo. The recent crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA bound to the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PCP, disclosed that ATP-DnaA forms a right-handed filament defined by specific protein–ATP interactions.3,32 This finding strongly suggests that through filament formation of multiple ATP-DnaA bound to oriC, a right-handed oriC DNA wrap is formed around the initiation nucleoprotein complex. It is plausible that this type of higher-order structure of the DnaA–DNA complex is formed at the stable DnaA-binding sites detected by our group.Notably, genes related to basic cellular functions are over-represented in neighboring genes. These include chromosome replication (dnaA and dnaN), translation (yqeI, yqeH: ribosome assembly; gidA, thdF: modification of tRNA; gidB: modification of 16S rRNA), and unknown essential functions (gcp, ywlC). In combination with transcriptome analysis of cells containing increased or decreased amounts of DnaA, we demonstrated that in addition to autoregulation, DnaA proteins stably associated with DNA directly regulate sda expression in a positive and ywlC and yydA expression in a negative manner. Furthermore, DnaA-dependent regulation of these genes was suggested to be maintained in other Bacillus species, indicating their biological significance. The DnaA-dependent control of dnaA and sda is well documented. In contrast, the functions of ywlC and yydA and the rationale for their DnaA-dependent regulation await further investigation. We additionally show that although thdF-gidA-gidB-noc expression is under control of DnaA in B. subtilis, this regulation is not universal in the Bacillus species.DnaA generally acts as a repressor of transcription in B. subtilis, probably through blocking the formation of initiation complex of transcription and/or a transcriptional roadblock. However, the location of DnaA boxes and transcriptional organization of the yqeG–sda region suggests an alternative mechanism of transcriptional regulation by DnaA. Interestingly, sda transcription is positively regulated by DnaA. It is possible that DnaA interacts with RNA polymerase as a transcriptional activator, although experimental evidence of these interactions is yet to be obtained. We identified a novel transcript negatively regulated by DnaA, which traverses the sda gene in the opposite orientation. RNA polymerase collisions would occur if both transcriptions were active simultaneously. If these collisions negatively regulate sda transcription, negative regulation of the opposite reaction would have a positive effect on sda expression. Additionally, upregulation of the sda promoter may be mediated through changes in superhelicity of the DNA template. If DnaA forms helical filaments and bound DNA is wrapped around the DnaA helix, as discussed earlier, positive superhelicity will be stabilized, as demonstrated by Erzberger et al.32 Superhelicity of template DNA is an important factor in determining transcriptional activity.44,45Estimation of stable DnaA-binding sequences using the A value in genome sequences of Bacillus species suggests that in addition to the upstream regions of dnaA, dnaN, sda, yydA, and ywlC, DnaA binds downstream of gcp in most bacteria examined. In addition, specific DnaA-binding sequences for each bacterium may be present in close proximity to oriC. These observations suggest that DnaA plays several additional roles, such as control of the amount of effective initiator, ATP-DnaA, as proposed for E. coli,46 and/or stabilization of domain structure of genome around oriC for the proper initiation of chromosome replication.However, although the importance of orientation of adjacent DnaA boxes for stable binding of DnaA has been investigated in E. coli,47 we did not take into account this factor to evaluate the DnaA-binding regions. Further improvements of bioinformatic methods to estimate the DnaA-binding regions are necessary.In conclusion, we have analyzed the distribution of the DnaA protein on the B. subtilis genome in actively growing cells, and confirmed its role as a direct regulator of several genes. Moreover, we propose that DnaA has additional functions related to chromosome replication. Thus, genome-wide analysis of DnaA-binding sites should facilitate our understanding of the role of B subtilis DnaA as a coordinator of bacterial cell growth.Supplementry DataSupplementry data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) on Priority Areas Systems Genomics from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAll surfaces of the human body are inhabited by complex microbial communities (microbiota).1–4 In adults, the combined microbial populations exceed 100 trillion cells, about 10 times the total number of cells composing the human body. Most reside in the intestinal tract, and in particular in the distal colon where cell densities are as high as 1012 g−1 of human feces. The members of the human intestinal microbiota are classified into more than 50 genera and hundreds of species representing nine bacterial and one archaeal division.1,5–7 The total number of genes encoded by their collective genomes (microbiome) is estimated to exceed that of the human genome by at least one order of magnitude.1 Our gut microbiota possesses many metabolic capabilities which are lacking in the human host and, thus, can be viewed as indispensable for human life.3 It contributes to host nutrition by enhancing the efficacy of energy harvest from ingested food and by synthesizing essential vitamins.1,8,9 It also affects a broad range of physiological properties of the human host, controlling, for instance, intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, energy balance, pH, the development of the immune system, and protection against pathogens.1,10–12 Imbalance of the intestinal microbiota can predispose individuals to a variety of disease states ranging from inflammatory bowel diseases to allergy and obesity.13–18The composition, dynamics, and functions of the human intestinal microbiota have been studied mostly using culture-based approaches and analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences.3,5,13,19 Notwithstanding these efforts, our understanding of this microbial community is still very limited, particularly with regard to the overall gene content, because of its high complexity and our inability to cultivate most of the microbial species residing in the gut. For instance, although it has been established that the microbiota of adults and unweaned infants differ in composition,6,7 it is largely unknown how such compositional differences affect the overall gene contents and functional properties.To explore the genomic features of complex microbial communities including uncultivable microbes, a culture-independent metagenomic approach is practical.20 In a pioneering study, it has been recently applied to fecal samples from two adult Americans.21 However, the data obtained from only two adults are insufficient for understanding the structure and functional capabilities of gut microbial communities, as they may be largely affected by various intrinsic and environmental factors, such as age, diet, and host genotype.7,16,22–25 Here, we extended the study to 13 healthy Japanese individuals, including adults, weaned children, and unweaned infants. The analysis not only indicated the presence of gene sets commonly enriched in human gut microbiomes, but also revealed intriguing differences of microbiomes between adults and unweaned infants and between American and Japanese individuals.2. Materials and methods2.1. SubjectsAll the subjects were healthy Japanese individuals. The ages, genders, and familial relationships of all subjects are summarized in Table 1. All subjects or their parents were informed of the purpose and protocol of this study. None of the subjects were given dietary restrictions except for antibiotics, probiotics, fermented foods (fermented beans, yogurt, etc.), and well-known functional foods for at least 4 weeks prior to sampling. None had a history of gastrointestinal disorder at the time of sampling, and none had unusual eating behaviors.Summary of the samples, sequencing, assembly, and gene annotationaThe total read length with Phred scores of >15.bThe number of genes predicted from the non-redundant sequences of each sample by the MetaGene program.cThe number of COGs to which at least one gene was assigned in each microbime.dThe average numbers of predicted genes belonging to each COG [(B)/(C)].eThe number of predicted genes showing similarity to genes in the ‘in-house extended NR database’.fThe number of genes showing no significant similarity to genes in the ‘in-house extended NR database’ (e-value ≥ 1.0e − 5 in the BLASTP analysis).Summary of the samples, sequencing, assembly, and gene annotationaThe total read length with Phred scores of >15.bThe number of genes predicted from the non-redundant sequences of each sample by the MetaGene program.cThe number of COGs to which at least one gene was assigned in each microbime.dThe average numbers of predicted genes belonging to each COG [(B)/(C)].eThe number of predicted genes showing similarity to genes in the ‘in-house extended NR database’.fThe number of genes showing no significant similarity to genes in the ‘in-house extended NR database’ (e-value ≥ 1.0e − 5 in the BLASTP analysis).2.2. Isolation of bacterial DNA from fecal samplesThe collected fecal samples were immediately placed under anaerobic conditions using the Anaero-Pack system (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co.), and transported at 4°C to the laboratory within 24 h. Three grams of wet fecal sample were suspended vigorously in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4). The suspension was filtered through a 100 µm mesh nylon filter (Falcon). The bacterial cells in the filtrates were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, suspended in 10 ml of Tris–EDTA containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), and then used for DNA isolation. The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26 In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55°C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55°C for 1 h with gentle mixing. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNase A treatment, ethanol, and finally polyethyleneglycol precipitation.To assess the efficiency of cell lysis, the total number of microbial cells was determined before and after the lytic treatment. A chamber with a depth of 0.02 mm (Erma, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the bacterial cell counting under a phase-contrast microscope (Leica; Leitz DMR model). The cell counting was repeated three times for each sample. The average efficiency of the cell lysis was apparently around 70% or more.2.3. DNA sequencing, assembly, and gene predictionShotgun libraries were constructed from randomly sheared bacterial DNA (2–3 kb) (HydroShear, GeneMachines) and the pUC18 vector. Template DNA for the sequencing was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the insert DNA using a TaKaRa ExTaq kit (Takara Bio) and GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (ABI) as described previously.27 Sequencing was carried out for both ends of the clones using the BigDye v3.1 chemistry on ABI3730 sequencers (ABI) or the ET chemistry on MegaBACE4500 sequencers (GE Healthcare). The shotgun reads from each sample were individually assembled to generate non-redundant metasequences using the PCAP software28 with default parameters.The MetaGene program,29 which is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm, was employed to predict potential protein-coding regions (open reading frames, ORFs ≥20 amino acids) from the metasequences of each sample. Prior to gene finding, we masked low-quality sequences (Phred score <15) using ‘Xs’.2.4. Database constructionThe ‘in-house extended NR database’ included the data set from the GenBank non-redundant amino-acid database (version 26, May 2007) plus a dataset obtained by MetaGene prediction from 44 unpublished microbial genome sequences (Supplementary Table S1). These unpublished sequences were obtained from the public database and the websites of the Genome Sequencing Center of Washington University, St Louis (http://genome.wustl.edu/sub_genome_group_index.cgi?GROUP = 3) and the Human Metagenome Consortium Japan (HMGJ; http://www.metagenome.jp/). The ‘reference dataset for COG (Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins) assignment’ (Supplementary Table S2) contained 343 microbial genome sequences where COG assignment has been made for all the genes by the NCBI. The ‘in-house reference database’ (referred to as ‘Ref-DB’) was constructed by selecting 243 microbial genomes (Supplementary Table S3) from the reference dataset for COG assignment. To avoid the effect of multiply sequenced species, we selected one representative strain from each species. To identify the genomic features specific to human gut microbiomes, known gut microbes were also excluded from Ref-DB.To search for the genes related to the Tn1549-like conjugative transposons (CTns), we also constructed a modified Ref-DB by adding the genes on Tn1549 from Enterococcus faecalis strain BM4382 (AAF72340-68)30 and on CTn2, CTn4, and CTn5 of Clostridium difficile strain 630.31 Since Ref-DB originally includes those on the Tn1549-like CTns from E. faecalis strain V583 32 and Streptococcus pyogenes strain MGAS10750,33 the modified Ref-DB contains six known Tn1549-like CTns.2.5. Clustering analysis of pairwise microbiome comparisonBLASTP34 analyses of all protein sequences from one microbiome against all those from every other were used to estimate the genomic similarities existing in all possible microbiome comparisons.18,35 Bit-scores of the best hits from every single sequence from one microbiome against another were summed up to yield a cumulative pairwise bit-score value. The cumulative bit-score values from all possible pairwise comparisons were then used to construct a distance matrix.18 Since the cumulative bit-score values from microbiome A to microbiome B [denoted as Σ(A,B)] is not equal to that from microbiome B to microbiome A [Σ(B,A)] in the non-reciprocal BLASTP analysis, we used the minimum of the two values, min[Σ(A,B), Σ(B,A)], as a measure of the similarity between microbiomes A and B. To normalize the differences derived from the size differences among the microbiomes, we calculated the measure of genome conservation distance, D2.36,37 The obtained distance matrix was then used for clustering by the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method.2.6. Taxonomic assignmentTaxonomic assignment of protein-coding genes was performed according to the best-hit pairs in the BLASTP analysis against the in-house extended NR database where the taxonomic information for all genes is available. For the first screening, all BLASTP results were filtered by e-value (≤1.0e − 8) and hit length coverage (≥50% of a query sequence). Then, to tentatively assign the taxonomic origins of the genes, we adopted a 90% BLASTP identity threshold. The genes with best-hit pairs under the threshold were assigned as ‘No hits’.2.7. COG assignment and evaluation of enrichmentCOG assignment of predicted gene products was made on the basis of the BLASTP analysis against the reference dataset for COG assignment. After filtering the BLASTP results by e-value (≤1.0e − 8) and aligned length coverage (≥50% of a query sequence), the COG assignment of each gene product was made according to the COG information of its best-hit pair in the reference dataset for COG assignment. If the best-hit pair was not assigned to any COG, the gene product was considered to be ‘uncharacterized’. On the basis of COG assignments, the size of each COG (the number of gene products belonging to each COG) was then counted up for every microbiome. Since most of the genes located at the contig ends and in singletons are predicted as ‘partial genes’ by MetaGene, their hit counts were corrected by the length ratio of each ‘partial gene’ to the reference to minimize multiple counts of fragmented genes. When a predicted gene product had a best-hit pair with a reference protein that has been assigned to multiple COGs, this hit was divided by the number of assigned COGs and the value was dispensed evenly to each COG. The size of each COG was normalized by the total number of genes predicted in each microbiome (‘normalized %’). The average size of each COG in previously sequenced microbial genomes in Ref-DB was also calculated and normalized by the average total gene number (‘DB %’). Finally, the magnitude of enrichment (enrichment value) of each COG was calculated for every microbiome by dividing the ‘normalized %’ by the ‘DB%’. COGs with an average enrichment value of > 2.0 were defined as enriched COGs in each microbiome because, in all the gut microbiomes examined, the enrichment values for 126 COGs belonging to the essential gene sets defined in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis mostly varied between 0.3 and 1.9, with a mean value of 0.92. A clustering analysis of microbiomes based on the COG enrichment values was performed using only the 868 COGs where at least one member was observed in every microbiome to avoid the effects of unidentified COGs. The matrix was clustered independently in the microbiomes and in the COGs using the pairwise complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of the uncentered correlation (cluster-1.3138).2.8. Orphan genes in human gut microbiomesOrphan genes whose products showed no significant similarity to known proteins were surveyed from the 662,548 genes predicted in the 13 samples by the BLASTP analysis with the e-value threshold of 1.0e − 5 against the ‘in-house extended NR database’. We also obtained orphan genes from the metagenomic sequences of other environmental microbiomes21,26,39 under the same condition. We then performed an all-to-all BLASTP analysis among the orphan gene products and selected the pairs having BLAST scores greater than 60. The gene products selected were subsequently clustered using the TribeMCL program40 with default parameters. Of the clusters comprising only the gene products derived from human gut microbiomes, those containing ≥30 members were further subjected to motif search/extraction with the HMMER program against the Pfam motif database41 and to identification of the conserved amino-acid sequences by using the MEME program.422.9. Accession numbersAll the assembled sequence data have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession numbers BAAU01000001-BAAU01028900 (subject F1-S), BAAV01000001-BAAV01036326 (F1-T), BAAW01000001-BAAW01016539 (F1-U), BAAX01000001-BAAX01036455 (F2-V), BAAY01000001-BAAY01030198 (F2-W), BAAZ01000001-BAAZ01031237 (F2-X), BABA01000001-BABA01035177 (F2-Y), BABB01000001-BABB01020226 (In-A), BABC01000001-BABC01009958 (In-B), BABD01000001-BABD01037296 (In-D), BABE01000001-BABE01020532 (In-E), BABF01000001-BABF01016164 (In-M), and BABG01000001-BABG01034797 (In-R).3. Results and discussion3.1. Samples, sequencing, and gene predictionThe subjects analysed in this study included seven adults (aged 24–45 years), two children (3 and 1.5 years), and four unweaned infants (3–7 months). Seven of the subjects belonged to two unrelated families consisting of three and four members, respectively (Table 1).We isolated the microbial DNA from each fecal sample, constructed shotgun libraries (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details), and produced a total of 1,057,481 shotgun reads (about 80,000 reads for each) representing sequences of about 727 Mb at a Phred score of >15 (Table 1). Relatively large numbers of total shotgun reads (67.6% on average) were assembled into contigs for each sample (Table 1), contrasted with the soil sample in which less than 1% of the total reads (nearly 150, 000 reads) were assembled.39 Although 52–80% (in most cases less than 60%) of the total reads were assembled in the adults and children, 79–89% were assembled in the unweaned infants. Therefore, the lengths of the non-redundant metasequences significantly differed between adult/child and infant microbiomes: 38.9–49.6 Mb for all adults and children except for one adult (29.9 Mb in In-A) and 14.9–28.1 Mb for all infants (Table 1). The total length of the contigs and singletons obtained from the 13 samples was 478.8 Mb.From each non-redundant metasequence, we identified 20,063–67,740 potential protein-coding genes (≥20 amino acids) by using the MetaGene program (Table 1). We might have overestimated the number of genes in our metasequences by false prediction and/or double counting of the fragmented ORFs that were derived from the same gene. The MetaGene program, however, predicted 1,406,000 ORFs in the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data,26 which is 8.7% more than that (1,284,108 ORFs) identified from the same dataset by evidence-based gene finding.3.2. Composition of human gut microbiotaTo compare the overall sequence similarities among the microbiomes from fecal and other-environmental samples,21,26,39 we performed a reciprocal BLASTP analysis of the whole gene set for each microbiome, followed by MDS clustering against the D2 normalized distance matrix (see ‘Materials and methods’). The data indicated that all gut microbiomes from the adults and weaned children form a distinct group (Fig. 1). In contrast, those from the unweaned infants were highly divergent from each other and from the microbiomes of the adults and children, as well as from those of other environments.Clustering analysis of microbiomes based on cumulative bitscore comparisons. MDS was applied to the distance matrix calculated from reciprocal pairwise BLASTP analysis among all predicted gene products. The dots represent fecal samples from adults and children (blue), unweaned infants (red), Americans (green), and samples from other natural environments (orange). Whale falls 1–3, Sargasso and soil indicate the metadata for microbial communities from the deep sea,39 surface seawater,26 and the surface soil of a farm,39 respectively.Clustering analysis of microbiomes based on cumulative bitscore comparisons.

Whale falls 1–3, Sargasso and soil indicate the metadata for microbial communities from the deep sea,39 surface seawater,26 and the surface soil of a farm,39 respectively.To determine the microbial composition at the genus level, we next conducted a BLASTP analysis of all the predicted genes against the genes in our ‘in-house extended NR database’ (see ‘Materials and methods’). With a threshold of 90% BLASTP identity, 17–43% of the predicted genes could be assigned to particular genera (35–65 genera, 121 in total) in the adults and children (Fig. 2). A significantly higher proportion of genes (35–55%) was assignable (31–61 genera, 84 in total) in the unweaned infants, but, overall, the data indicated that the majority of gut microbes are as yet uncharacterized. We detected a total of 142 genera from the 13 samples in this analysis.Compositional view of human intestinal microbiomes. A compositional view of microbiomes based on the taxonomic assignment of protein-coding genes is shown. The stacked bars represent the compositions of each sample estimated from the results of BLASTP analysis with a 90% threshold identity. ‘Others’ includes the genera whose proportions were less than 1% in any of the samples. The data for the fecal samples from two American adults (‘Sub. 7’ and ‘Sub. 8’) are also shown.Compositional view of human intestinal microbiomes.

The stacked bars represent the compositions of each sample estimated from the results of BLASTP analysis with a 90% threshold identity. ‘Others’ includes the genera whose proportions were less than 1% in any of the samples. The data for the fecal samples from two American adults (‘Sub. 7’ and ‘Sub. 8’) are also shown.Despite the low proportion of assigned genes, their taxonomic distribution indicated a clear compositional change after weaning. In the adults and weaned children, the major constituents were always Bacteroides, followed by several genera belonging to the division Firmicutes, such as Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium, and the genus Bifidobacterium. In the infants, Bifidobacterium and/or a few genera from the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia, Raoultella, and Klebsiella, were the major constituents. A significant level of inter-individual variation was observed also among the adults and children, but there was a much higher variation among the unweaned infants.To further evaluate the microbial composition at the species level, we examined the intra-genus diversity of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, the most dominant genera in the adults and children and in the infants, respectively. Taking advantage of the number of available genome sequences belonging to these two genera (11 species from Bacteroides, five from Bifidobacterium), we performed a mapping analysis of the shotgun reads to these genomes using the BLASTN program34 with a threshold of ≥95% identity and ≥150 bp aligned length. The analysis demonstrated that, for each infant, more than 80% of the shotgun reads were mapped to Bifidobacterium derived from a single species or genome (Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, the shotgun reads from the adults and children were mapped to multiple Bacteroides species except for In-A, suggesting a compositional complexity of this genus in human gut microbiota.Together with the results of the shotgun sequence assembly (Table 1), the data from these compositional analyses showed a clear structural difference between the microbiota of the unweaned infants and those of the adults and weaned children. Infant microbiota were dominated by a few microbial species or strains, exhibiting rather simple structures, but showed a remarkable inter-individual variation. In contrast, most microbiota of the adults and children were much more complex in species composition, but exhibited high levels of overall sequence similarity between the samples. In In-A, the shotgun read sequences apparently derived from a few species of Bacteroides and Eubacterium were notably dominated (data not shown), accounting for the significantly shorter non-redundant sequence of In-A (see Subsection 3.1 and Table 1).It should also be noted that the samples from Japanese and American21 adults differed significantly in composition, particularly in terms of Bacteroides and archaeal species (Fig. 2). The gut microbiomes from two American samples contained very few sequences and genes assigned to Bacteroides species and a significant number of sequences and genes assigned to an archaeal species, whereas the gut microbiomes from the Japanese samples contained a high ratio of sequences and genes assigned to Bacteroides species and almost no archaeal sequences and genes. Further studies should establish the reasons for these intriguing differences, which could be due to various factors including the genetic background and dietary style of the hosts, but also to differences in the experimental conditions between the two studies.3.3. Functional assignment of predicted genesFunctional assignment of predicted genes (662,548 in total) was made on the basis of BLASTP analysis against the ‘reference dataset for COG assignment’ (see ‘Materials and methods’). By this analysis, about 48% of the predicted genes were assigned to a total of 3,268 COGs (Table 1). The number of COGs identified in the infant microbiomes showed remarkable inter-individual variation (1617–2857 COGs), in contrast to those of the adults and children (2355–2921 COGs). Also, the number of orthologous genes belonging to each COG in the infants was on average about two-third of that observed in the adults and children. These results indicate that the gene repertoires in the gut microbiomes are more variable and functionally less redundant in infants than in adults and children.To explore the functional characteristics of human intestinal microbiota, we looked for significantly over- or under-represented COGs in gut microbiomes when compared with Ref-DB (see ‘Materials and methods’). As shown in Fig. 3, human gut microbiomes showed patterns distinct from those of other environments such as sea and soil. The over-representation of COGs classified into the ‘Carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ category and the under-representation of those for ‘Lipid transport and metabolism’ were observed in all the human gut microbiomes examined in this study. However, a clear difference was observed between the adults/children and the unweaned infants. The gut microbiomes from the adults and children exhibited a uniform pattern, and the over-representation of COGs for ‘Defense mechanisms’ and under-representation of ‘Cell motility’, ‘Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’ and ‘Post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’ were remarkable (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the infant microbiomes showed variable patterns (Fig. 3C). The enrichment values of all the COGs in each microbiome are shown in Supplementary Table S5.Summary of the COG assignment of predicted genes.

The genes not assignable to any COGs are not shown in this figure.Profiling analysis based on the COG enrichment values calculated for each microbiome further demonstrated that, while the gut microbiomes of the adults and children showed similar profiles, those of the infants had distinct and more variable profiles (Fig. 4; also see Supplementary Fig. S1). It may be noteworthy that neither this analysis nor the overall sequence similarity analysis shown in Fig. 1 provided any conclusive evidence for the resemblance of the genomic features of gut microbiomes among family members and within the sexes.Relationship between human intestinal microbiomes and other-environmental microbiomes based on their functional profiles. The result of a clustering analysis of microbiomes based on the enrichment values of each COG calculated for each microbiome is shown. The matrix was clustered independently in the samples and COGs using the pairwise complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of the uncentered correlation (cluster-1.31). Also, see Supplementary Fig. S1.Relationship between human intestinal microbiomes and other-environmental microbiomes based on their functional profiles.

The matrix was clustered independently in the samples and COGs using the pairwise complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of the uncentered correlation (cluster-1.31). Also, see Supplementary Fig. S1.3.4. A gene set commonly enriched in adult-type gut microbiomesCOGs that are commonly enriched in the microbiomes of all adults and children were searched, and 237 COGs met the following criteria: (i) the average enrichment value exceeds 2.0 and (ii) the enrichment value in all subjects exceeds 1.0 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6). When the samples from two adult Americans were included in the analysis, 79% (188) of the 237 COGs still met the above criteria, even though the American data contained, unusually, only a few sequences derived from Bacteroides species (Fig. 2). In contrast, only 5–10% of these COGs exhibited an enrichment value of >2.0 in the microbiomes of other environments. Therefore, these COGs are specifically enriched in adult-type gut microbiomes, and thus may encode important functions for the gut microbiota itself as well as for its host.Functional distribution of commonly enriched COGs. The functional distribution of commonly enriched COGs in adult/child microbiomes (‘A-gutCEGs’), in infant microbiomes (‘I-gutCEGs’), or in both types of microbiomes is shown: see Fig. 3 for the COG categorization.Functional distribution of commonly enriched COGs. The functional distribution of commonly enriched COGs in adult/child microbiomes (‘A-gutCEGs’), in infant microbiomes (‘I-gutCEGs’), or in both types of microbiomes is shown: see Fig. 3 for the COG categorization.Pyruvate-formate lyase (COG1882), which catalyzes the non-oxidative conversion of pyruvate to formate and acetyl-coenzyme A, was enriched. Unexpectedly, however, genes for the formate hydrogenlyase system that decomposes formate to CO2 and H2 were rather under-represented. In this regard, of interest is the enrichment of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (COG2759), methenyl tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (COG3404), and methionine synthase (COG1410), all of which are enzymes involved in the regulation of one carbon pool by folate. Their enrichment may suggest that one carbon unit of formate can be utilized effectively by the gut microbiota in the folate-mediated cycle of one carbon pool. In contrast to the enrichment of enzymes for anaerobic pyruvate metabolism, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (COG2069) was profoundly depleted. All components of the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the membrane respiratory chain (with the exception of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) were also significantly under-represented in all subjects, but phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (COG1866) and pyruvate carboxyltransferase (COG5016), which generate oxaloacetate, an entry substrate to the TCA cycle in the reductive pathway, were enriched. Together with the striking depletion of most gene families whose products scavenge oxygen radicals, these findings reflect well the fact that the adult gut ecosystem is a kingdom of strict anaerobes.The enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism genes was also striking: 24% (53 COGs) of the commonly enriched COGs had this function. At least 14 families of glycosyl hydrolases for plant-derived dietary polysaccharides and host tissue-derived proteoglycans or glycoconjugates were enriched in the adults. In addition, many enzymes involved in the metabolism of mono- or disaccharides released by these glycosyl hydrolases, such as l-fucose isomerase (COG2407), l-arabinose isomerase (COG2160), and galactokinase (COG0153), were also over-represented. Several peptidase families (COG1362, COG2195, COG3340, and COG3579) were also enriched, but most genes for fatty-acid metabolism were selectively reduced in number. These findings support the notion that the colonic microbiota utilizes otherwise indigestible polysaccharides and peptides as major resources for energy production and biosynthesis of cellular components.7,8 The enrichment of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (COG1866), glycogen synthase (COG0297) and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (COG0448) suggests that energy storage is also an important activity of adult-type gut microbiota. This activity may be required for the gut microbiota to cope with intermittent nutrient supply in the adult gut. The enrichment of antimicrobial peptide transporters (COG0577 and COG1132) and a multidrug efflux pump (COG0534) is also of interest. Host intestinal cells produce various cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), such as beta-defensins.43 Many microorganisms also produce CAMPs to compete with other microbes sharing the same niche. The enrichment of antimicrobial peptide transporters and the multidrug efflux pump may play a primary role in the stable colonization of gut microbes in the adult intestine by conferring resistance to CAMPs.The enrichment of several enzymes for DNA repair is also noteworthy (Supplementary Table S6). These enzymes may be needed to repair microbial DNA damage caused by genotoxic substances, such as nitrosamines and heterocyclic amines contained in ingested foods and secondary bile acids and nitroso compounds synthesized in the intestine via gut microbiota-involving processes.44 It is conceivable that not only the host cells but also intestinal microbes are constantly exposed to such genotoxic compounds.Another distinguishing feature of the adult-type microbiota is the striking depletion of genes for the biosynthesis of flagella and chemotaxis (Supplementary Table S5). This implies that motility and chemotaxis are not required for the intestinal microbes to persist in the gut, where the contents are constantly stirred by peristalsis. Rather, flagellated microbes may be easily eliminated by the host immune system because flagella are highly immunogenic. Abnegation of motility may be another adaptation mechanism of gut microbes to the intestinal environment.3.5. A gene set commonly enriched in infant-type gut microbiomesDespite the high inter-individual variation, 136 COGs were found to be commonly enriched in the infant microbiomes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6). Of these, 58 were also over-represented in the adult/child microbiomes.Genes for anaerobic energy production were also enriched in infants, but genes for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and all components of the oxidative TCA cycle were present in the infants at a frequency similar to that in Ref-DB. These findings may reflect the compositional feature of the infant gut microbiota, which contains considerable numbers of facultative anaerobes (Fig. 2).In infant microbiomes, about 35% (47) of the 136 enriched COGs were for ‘Carbohydrate transport and metabolism,’ including 12 families of glycosyl hydrolases, nine of which were enriched also in the adult gut microbiomes. Unexpectedly, they included several enzymes that degrade non-digestible polysaccharides of plant origin, such as pullulanase and related glycosidases (COG1523), arabinogalactan endo-1,4-beta-galactosidase (COG3867), and endopolygalacturonase (COG5434). These enzymes may act to degrade oligosaccharides in breast milk or host-derived proteoglycans like mucin to maintain the functional homeostasis of gut epithelia.45 It is also possible that the gut microbiota is ready to utilize plant-derived polysaccharides to some extent before weaning.The over-representation of various transport systems was also characteristic to infants, with 22% (29) of the 136 enriched COGs being transporters. In particular, the enrichment of phosphotransferase systems that mediate active sugar transport was remarkable. This prokaryote-specific transport system may play a central role in the uptake of lactose and other easily digestible simple sugars rich in breast milk. The over-representation of other transporters may also be advantageous to the microbes in the infant intestine because breast milk contains many other essential nutrients such as amino acids, long-chain fatty acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and minerals in a readily available form. The difference in diet between adults and unweaned infants appears to affect other functional properties as well. For instance, the genes for defense mechanisms and DNA repair that were over-represented in the adults were not so in the infants.3.6. A CTn family amplified in the intestineAlthough this remains largely unproven, the distal colon has been regarded an ecologically suitable site for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between microorganisms due to its high microbial cell density.2 We identified many gene families related to transposases and bacteriophages in the metagenomic data, but their over-representation was noted only in certain individuals (Supplementary Table S5). An exception to this was a set of genes homologous to those on Tn1549-like CTns, which was notably enriched in most of the gut microbiomes analysed here (Fig. 6). Tn1549 was originally identified in an E. faecalis strain,30 thereafter, its relatives have been identified in another E. faecalis strain, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, and Streptococcus.31,32,46,47 It has also been recorded that Tn1549 is transferable between C. symbiosum and Enterococcus spp.48 The homologues found in the metagenomic data accounted for 0.8% of all the predicted genes (5,325 genes in total) and were also enriched in the two fecal samples from American individuals21 (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S7). They were highly divergent in sequence from the corresponding genes on six known Tn1549-like CTns (Fig. 6C), but frequently appeared as gene clusters on contigs. We identified 89 contigs that contained four or more genes related to Tn1549-like CTns. These genes appeared there in the same or a similar gene organization as seen in Tn1549-like CTns (Supplementary Table S7), suggesting that they were derived from divergent members of a Tn1549-like CTn family, which we refer to as ‘CTnRINT’ (CTn rich in intestine). By analysing these contigs, we found that CTnRINT members contain a variety of genes, such as those for ABC-type multidrug transport systems, in the regions corresponding to that for the vancomycin-resistance genes on Tn1549 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6B, other known Tn1549-like CTns also contain various accessory genes in this region. These findings strongly suggest that the CTnRINT family is largely involved in the process of HGT in the human intestine. It seems reasonable that conjugal elements, which mediate genetic exchanges and transmittance through cell–cell contact, are key players in HGT in the colon.The Tn1549-like CTn family, ‘CTnRINT’, explosively amplified in human gut microbiomes.

The BLASTP identity (%) for a CTnRINT-related gene product was plotted in the CTn column where its best-hit homologue was identified.In addition to the CTnRINT family, we found that integrases/site-specific recombinases belonging to COG4974 were remarkably expanded in the microbiomes of the adults and children. Most of them were apparently derived from several types of integrative mobile genetic elements such as Tn916-like CTns49, suggesting that other types of integrative elements are also richly present in human gut microbiomes.3.7. Orphan gene families in human gut microbiomesOf the 662,548 genes predicted in the 13 samples, 162,647 were orphan genes (25% of the total genes). Similarly, 503,115 orphan genes were obtained from other-environmental microbiomes.21,26,39 An all-to-all BLASTP analysis of these 665,762 orphan gene products followed by a clustering analysis (see ‘Materials and methods’) yielded 160,543 clusters and 461,435 singletons. Of the 160,543 clusters, 647 comprised five or more gene products derived only from human fecal samples (Supplementary Table S8). The largest two clusters, ID37 and ID39 containing 48 and 47 members, respectively, were present in the microbiomes of all the Japanese adults and children, and also in those of the American adults. For eight clusters that comprise ≥30 gene members, we performed motif search/extraction analyses by using the HMMER program against the Pfam motif database.41 Only two gene products in cluster ID44 showed a significant similarity to a Pfam motif (PF07508; recombinase); other gene products in cluster ID44 showed no significant similarity in the Pfam database. We could identify the conserved amino-acid sequences (38–50 amino acids) for each cluster by using the MEME program42 (Supplementary Fig. S2). These conserved sequences may represent new motifs specific to human gut microbiomes.3.8. Remarks and future perspectivesThe present study is the first large-scale comparative metagenomic analysis of human gut microbiomes. The data provided several new lines of insight into the genomic features of gut microbiota. First, our data clearly demonstrated a difference in overall composition and gene repertoire between adult- and infant-type gut microbiomes. The simple and less redundant features of the infant-type gut microbiota are probably linked to its high inter-individual variability (Figs. 1, 2, and 3C). We suggest that the infant-type can be viewed as unstable, yet dynamic and adaptable. Conversely, the functional uniformity observed in the adult-type microbiota (Figs. 1, 3B, and 4) may be attributable to its more complex nature (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and S2), which in turn suggests that the insurance hypothesis50 for the benefit of biodiversity may be relevant to the gut.Secondly, a comparison of the gene contents between gut microbiota and previously sequenced microbes revealed 237 COGs commonly enriched in adult-type microbiomes and 136 COGs in infant-type microbiomes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6). The characterization of these genes revealed distinct nutrient acquisition strategies in each type of microbiota, possibly to accommodate very different diets of their hosts. The analysis also revealed several possible strategies through which intestinal microbes adapt to the intestinal environment and establish symbiotic relationships with their host. Thus, these genes, which we refer to as ‘Adult- or Infant-gut Commonly Enriched Genes’ (A-gutCEGs or I-gutCEGs), appear to encode some of the core functions of each type of microbiota. It is noteworthy that the two gene sets contain as many as 104 gene families of unknown functions (Fig. 5). The in vitro and in vivo functions of these uncharacterized genes as well as those of the 647 ‘new’ gene families (Supplementary Table S8) would be important topics of future studies.Thirdly, a survey of the enriched genes revealed an abundance of mobile genetic elements in the human intestinal gene pool, emphasizing that the human gut microbiota is a “hot spot” for HGT between microbes. Of particular importance is the abundance of conjugal elements including CTnRINT. Considering their high transfer efficiency, the broad range of hosts, and the frequent carriage of drug-resistance genes, it would be prudent to reassess the heavy use of antibiotics in modern medicine.Finally, the metagenomic datasets presented here will be of great use for understanding the roles of gut microbiota in the etiology of human diseases and also for scientifically evaluating the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics and other ‘functional foods’ that are widely used for modulating the intestinal microbiota in an effort to improve our health7.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Comprehensive Genomics’ (M.H.) and ‘Applied Genomics’ (T.H. and T.K.) from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology of Japan, and a Grant-in-Aid from the Institute for Bioinformatics Research and Development, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (BIRD-JST) (K.K.).We thank Jun Ishikawa, Pawan K.

IntroductionThe helicase superfamily is made up of three functional classes, DNA helicases, RNA helicases, and chromatin remodeling ATPases, and the members of this family play a crucial role in various nucleic acid- and chromatin-mediated cellular reactions such as DNA replication, repair and recombination, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA interference, and chromatin remodeling.1–5 Since these reactions are essential for maintenance, expression, and regulation of genetic information in the chromosome, dysfunctions of helicase genes may lead to genetic diseases, including cancers. Indeed, genetic mutations of the human RecQ-like BLM and the WRN DNA helicase result in the early development of various cancers and premature aging, respectively.6 Most helicases share conserved amino acid sequence motifs, and these genes are classified into five families (SF1–SF5) on the basis of the occurrence and characteristics of conserved motifs.7 Because of the biological importance of the helicase family, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the functions of helicase family members in two model organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. Previously, we examined loss-of-function phenotypes of yeast novel helicase-related genes, using gene knockout strains and characterized gene expression profiles by northern blotting.8 In our previous study, we identified 21 uncharacterized genes including five essential genes YDL031W[DBP10], YDL084W[SUB2], YKL078W[DHR2], YLR276C[DBP9], and YMR128W[ECM16], and YDL070W[BDF2] and YGL150C[INO80] were later shown to be non-essential. Some of these novel genes were subsequently characterized to clarify their molecular functions, for example, SUB2 in pre-mRNA splicing,9DHR2, ECM16 and several DEAD-box genes such as DBP9 in ribosome biogenesis,10,11YOL095C(HMI1) in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA,12 and INO80 and YDR334W(SWR1) in chromatin remodeling and transcription.13,14 Thus, comprehensive analyses focusing on the helicase superfamily can lead to the discovery of novel genes required for basic cellular reactions involved in cell proliferation, development, and aging.In the current study, we have focused on helicase family members in a multicellular organism, the nematode C. elegans, using an RNA interference (RNAi) technique. Indeed, many novel multicellular specific proteins from other gene families have been discovered by RNAi-mediated comprehensive studies in C. elegans, including SR-related proteins,15,16 proteins for the ubiquitylation system,17 the forkhead proteins,18 and G protein-coupled receptors.19 Comparative analysis of helicase-like proteins in yeast and C. elegans will allow us to identify nematode-specific proteins that likely play an important role in multicellular organism-specific functions such as morphogenesis. Identification and characterization of these higher eukaryote-specific helicases will be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases caused by mutations of human helicase-like genes.Here, we found 134 genes encoding putative helicase-like proteins in C. elegans and systematically prepared RNAi-treated animals for each of these genes to characterize their loss-of-function phenotypes. Fifty-one of 129 genes tested caused embryonic lethality or growth defects by RNAi, and these genes contained many putative homologs of yeast essential helicase-like genes. We identified two divergent gene clusters and 10 pairs of putative gene duplications on chromosomes and found germline- and oogenesis-enriched expression of many helicase-like genes. In addition, an RNAi-based screen was performed to identify genes required for resistance to X-ray irradiation, resulting in successful identification of the novel D2005.5(drh-3) gene.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence analysesIdentification of helicase-like proteins in C. elegans was performed as described in the legend of Table 1. Helicases were classified according to the yeast helicase-like protein subfamilies by Linder (http://www.medecine.unige.ch/~linder/helicases_list.html) with modifications (i.e. addition of the new subfamilies MPH1, PIF1, RAD3, and RECQ). Most orthologous proteins were identified from the InParanoid database20 as described in the legend of Table 2. Homologous members in gene pairs and clusters were identified by homology search in C. elegans nucleotide sequence databases as described in the legend of Supplementary Table S4.Summary of RNAi analyses of C. elegans helicase-like genes*Summary of RNAi analyses of C. elegans helicase-like genes*Comparison of loss-of-function phenotypes of helicase-like genes in S. cerevisiae and C. elegansLoss of function phenotypes of helicase like proteins in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans are summarized according to subfamily for comparison between species. aC. elegans proteins putatively orthologous to the yeast helicase like proteins and E values of the BLAST analyses are shown.

C. elegans strains and culture proceduresC. elegans wild-type strain Bristol N2 and the RNAi-hypersensitive rrf-3 mutant strain NL2099 (rrf-3(pk1426) II)21 (obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center) were used in this study. Animals were maintained at 20°C on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with the Escherichia coli OP50 strain, as described previously.222.3. Construction of recombinant DNAGenomic DNA or cDNA fragments corresponding to helicase-like genes were cloned into the blunted EcoRI site of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) expression vector pPD129.36 (a kind gift of Dr A. Fire, Stanford University School of Medicine, USA). Insert DNA was directly amplified by PCR from a C. elegans embryo cDNA library (No. 937007, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) or genomic DNA (N2), using a gene-specific primer set for blunt-end cloning. PCR primers were purchased from Sawady (Tokyo) and Proligo LLC (Boulder, USA), and nucleotide sequences of the primers will be provided upon request. The nucleotide sequences of the resultant recombinant clones were determined by dye-terminator cycle sequencing.2.4. Feeding RNAiRNAi by feeding bacteria was performed using the N2 and the rrf-3 strains, as described previously,23 with the following modifications. In brief, the HT115(DE3) E. coli strain containing the pDP129.36 with a target gene-specific insert was grown overnight in 2× YT medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin (or 50 µg/mL carbenicillin and 12.5 µg/mL tetracycline) with stirring at 37°C. Aliquots of the culture (30 µL) were spread onto NGM agar in a Petri dish (Ø 6 cm) containing 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the indicated antibiotics and incubated at 37°C for 18 h for RNAi (RNAi plates). The next day, P0 animals at the fourth larval (L4) to young adult stages were placed onto the RNAi plates and fed the recombinant E. coli strain expressing dsRNA for over 18 h to avoid F1 progeny with leaky phenotypes. Subsequently, P0 animals were transferred onto new RNAi plates with bacteria-expressing dsRNA for 12 h to lay eggs (F1) and then removed. The eggs on this second RNAi plate were used for phenotypic analyses of F1 progeny. HT115(DE3) with vector alone was used as control bacteria for mock RNAi treatments. For double-RNAi treatment, 50 µL of culture suspension equally mixed with growing bacteria for each target gene was seeded on RNAi plates for dsRNA expression.2.5. Phenotypic analyses of RNAi-treated animalsThe hatching rate of the eggs was determined as described previously.24 RNAi-treated animals for 12 h were transferred onto a new RNAi plate to lay eggs for 12 h. F1 eggs laid on the RNAi plate were cultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the numbers of hatched larvae and dead eggs were scored to determine the hatching rate. The experiments were repeated at least twice. Growth of hatched F1 progeny was monitored by body length measurements as described previously.22 The growth-defect phenotypes were tentatively classified as larval arrest (Lva), slow growth (Gro), and normal growth (WT), using the growth retardation index, as described in the legend of Table 1. Brood size of RNAi-treated animals was examined in two ways as described in the legend of Supplementary Table S2. X-ray sensitivity assay of RNAi-treated animals was performed as described in the legend of Tables 3 and 4.Influence of X-ray irradiation on the viability of F1 progeny from RNAi-treated animalsThe cDNA fragments corresponding to D2005.5 and rad-51(Y43C5A.6) were amplified from phage cDNA clones yk331a2 and yk401c3 (a kind gift of Dr Y. Kohara, National Institute of Genetics, Japan), respectively, by PCR with the primer set yk5′-F (5′-TGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC-3′) and yk3′-SmaR (5′-TTCCCGGGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG-3′). These cDNAs were used for X-ray-induced embryonic lethality assay. The genomic DNA fragment (∼2.3 kb) corresponding to Y66D12A.15 was amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA (N2 strain) by PCR using the primer set Y66Dex1-3F (5′-AAGCTTGAAAAACCCAGAAAAATGGCA-3′) and Y66Dex1-3R (5′-TTCCACTCCAACCTTGGTCGCATCGGC-3′). These fragments were cloned into the dsRNA expression vector, and the nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Four young adult worms were fed bacteria-expressing dsRNA to the target gene on an RNAi plate for 18 h and were subsequently X-ray-irradiated (Radioflex 320CG, RIGAKU, Tokyo) at a rate of 2 Gy/min. Irradiated animals were transferred onto a fresh RNAi plate, cultured for 2 days to lay eggs and then removed. After 24 h, the hatching rate of eggs laid on the plate was determined. The total numbers of eggs counted are indicated in parentheses.Influence of X-ray irradiation on the viability of F1 progeny from RNAi-treated animalsThe cDNA fragments corresponding to D2005.5 and rad-51(Y43C5A.6) were amplified from phage cDNA clones yk331a2 and yk401c3 (a kind gift of Dr Y.

The D2005.5 cDNA fragment (∼1.5 kb) was amplified from a C. elegans embryo cDNA library using the primers D1-BF (5′-CCGGGATCCATCGTTGATCTGATGCCTGCGATGG-3′) and ZAP-R (5′-GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′). The D2005.5 cDNA and gei-17 genomic DNA fragment were used for an X-ray-induced growth retardation assay.

Results3.1. Identification of helicase-like genes in C. elegansIn this study, we have expanded our analyses of helicase family members from unicellular eukaryote S. cerevisiae to a multicellular animal, the nematode C. elegans. A sequence homology search, with known helicase-like proteins as the queries, identified 134 gene products in the recent C. elegans protein data in the public nematode database WormBase25 (release WS162). These proteins were classified into 10 subfamilies (DEAD-box, DEAH-box, SKI2, UPF1, SWI2/SNF2, MCM, PIF1, MPH1, RAD3, and RECQ) on the basis of a modified classification of yeast helicase-like proteins and one group of ‘other helicase-like proteins’ containing 11 orphan proteins (Table 1). Three subfamilies (DEAD-box, DEAH-box, and SKI2) contain many proteins involved in aspects of RNA metabolism, including ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA degradation, and translation.2,3 A number of the proteins in the MCM,26 PIF1,27 RAD3, and RECQ6 subfamilies play roles in DNA-mediated reactions, and the SWI2/SNF2 members act primarily in chromatin remodeling and/or DNA metabolism.4,5 The total number of helicase-like proteins in C. elegans (134 proteins) was greater than the number of yeast helicase-like proteins (103 proteins including 21 subtelomeric helicase-like proteins).28 Among the genes identified were six nematode homologs of mammal- and plant-specific helicase-like genes (polq-1, nsh-1, dic-1, F46G11.1, F52G3.3, and F52G3.4) and five C. elegans-specific SNF2-like genes (C25F9.4, C25F9.5, M04C3.1, M04C3.2, and Y43F8B.14). Six Helitrons, a novel class of mobile genetic elements encoding a ‘rolling circle’ replication protein and a helicase29,30 (F33H12.6, F59H6.5, Y16E11A.2, Y27F2A.5, Y46B2A.2, and ZK250.9), were also identified.Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Caenorhabditis briggsae proteins homologous to each C. elegans protein are presented in Table 1. Most helicase-like genes were well conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae, with the exception of the C. elegans-specific SNF2-like genes, several PIF1-like genes including the Helitrons, and plant helicase-like gene homologs (F52G3.3 and F52G3.4). Although homologs of the Helitrons, F52G3.3, and F52G3.4 were detected in plants (data not shown), these three gene groups were not conserved in humans or flies. We detected putative human and fly homologs of many genes from the known subfamilies, as well as the orphan genes, but we were unable to find putative counterparts of several DEAD-box genes including four glh genes, some of the UPF1- and SWI2/SNF2-like genes, and most of the PIF1 members, in addition to the C. elegans-specific SNF2-like genes and two plant helicase-like genes (Table 1).3.2. Phenotypic analyses of C. elegans RNAi-treated for helicase-like genesOf the 134 genes identified in this study, 49 corresponded to genes of known function; however, the functions of the remaining genes are unknown. Therefore, we used the feeding RNAi method to identify loss-of-function phenotypes of uncharacterized helicase-like genes to aid in ascertaining the function of the gene products. We prepared 129 dsRNA expression constructs with cDNA or genomic DNA fragments of the target genes, and E. coli transformants expressing dsRNA were fed to P0 animals to examine the RNAi-induced phenotypes of the resultant F1 progeny. Typical culture images of the F1 progeny 3 days after hatching are shown in Fig. 1. The control progeny from mock-treated P0 animals grew to adults and laid F2 eggs (Fig. 1A). In contrast, eggs laid by RNAi-treated animals for mcm-6, encoding a subunit of the replicative MCM helicase,26 exhibited an embryonic lethal phenotype (Fig. 1B). RNAi for the uncharacterized genes W08D2.7 and ZK686.2 encoding a yeast Ski2p-like protein and a DEAD-box protein caused larval growth arrest (Fig. 1C) and growth retardation (Fig. 1D), respectively, suggesting that both gene products are essential for development and/or larval growth. RNAi for Y50D7A.11 which encodes an ERCC2-like protein caused a progeny sterile phenotype (no F2 eggs in the culture) with growth retardation (Fig. 1E). In addition to embryonic lethality and sterility,31 we observed an RNAi-induced developmental abnormality (a protruding vulva phenotype in Fig. 1F) and increased mortality (Fig. 1G) among F1 survivors of cgh-1(RNAi) animals.Typical phenotypes of F1 progeny from nematodes RNAi-treated for helicase-like genes.

Fig. 2 shows growth curves of F1 larvae from animals treated with for 22 helicase members. Growth of progeny from T26G10.1(RNAi) and B0511.6(RNAi) was almost completely arrested (Fig. 2); however, RNAi-induced growth retardation was variable in progeny among the targeted genes. For example, growth rates of progeny from F58E10.3(RNAi), Y23H5B.6(RNAi), and mock-treated animals were calculated to be 3.4, 8.7, and 17.6 µm/h, respectively (Fig. 2). The level of growth defects in the progeny is represented as the growth retardation index in Table 1.Influence of RNAi treatment of helicase family genes on larval growth. The growth of F1 larvae from eggs laid by RNAi-treated P0 animals was monitored by measuring the body length of progeny. The resultant growth curves of progeny of animals (N2 strain) that were RNAi-treated for the indicated 10 genes (T26G10.1 to Y23H5B.6) in the DEAD-box subfamily are shown together with the growth curve of progeny without RNAi-treatment [control (A)]. The growth curves obtained from RNAi experiments for the genes in other subfamilies are shown with their control growth curve [control (B)] as follows: Y54E10A.9(vbh-1) from the DEAD-box subfamily; C06E1.10(rha-2), F56D2.6, and T05E8.3 from the DEAH-box subfamily; W08D2.7 from the SKI2 subfamily; Y80D3A.2(emb-4) in the UPF1 subfamily; F26F12.7(let-418) and Y111B2A.22(ssl-1) from the SWI2/SNF2 subfamily; Y50D7A.11 from the RAD3 subfamily; and F20H11.2(nsh-1) as an orphan member, respectively.

Furthermore, we successfully obtained several new phenotypes; for instance, RNAi for two DEAD-box subfamily members, C24H12.4 and Y71G12B.8, resulted in larval arrest and slow growth, respectively. RNAi for Y66D12A.15, which encodes an ortholog of the human ERCC3-like protein, and psa-4, which is required for embryonic development,32 resulted in embryonic lethality in the current study. [These phenotypes in Y66D12A.15(RNAi) and psa-4(RNAi) were not previously present in the database (WS162), but have been recently confirmed in the updated version (WS171) during revision of the manuscript.] On the other hand, it was reported that RNAi for dna-2, F20A1.9, F52B5.3, F59A7.8, M03C11.2, M03C11.8, Y116A8C.13, and Y37E11AM.1 caused an embryonic lethal phenotype, but no growth defect and/or visible abnormalities were observed in our experiments even using the RNAi-hypersensitive rrf-3 mutant33,34 as a host (data not shown). The discrepancies of RNAi experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.In this study, we examined effects of suppression of 39 germline- or oocyte-expressed helicase-like genes on brood size by feeding RNAi from L1 stage or from L4 stage (Supplementary Table S2). Reduction in brood size was observed in F55F8.2(RNAi) and T05E8.3(RNAi) animals in the L4 RNAi experiments. In the L1 RNAi experiments, suppression of F56D2.6 and C08F8.2 caused significant reductions of brood size; however, reduction was due to sterility in P0 animals by F56D2.6 RNAi and to embryonic lethality by C08F8.2 RNAi (data not shown). Reduced brood size in C08F8.2(RNAi) and F55F8.2(RNAi) animals has been observed previously by others.353.3. An RNAi-mediated screen for helicase-like genes involved in resistance to X-ray irradiationWe tried to identify genes that play important roles in specific conditions—in this case, X-ray irradiation—and applied the feeding RNAi technique to screen for genes involved in protection against X-ray-induced DNA damage. Assuming that dysfunctions in candidate genes would cause hypersensitivity to X-rays, animals RNAi-treated for 87 helicase-like genes that were dispensable for embryonic survival were tested for their X-ray sensitivity. RNAi-treated P0 animals were irradiated with X-rays (40 Gy), and the hatching rate of the resultant F1 progeny was examined. Several candidate genes were detected, but only D2005.5(drh-3) RNAi reproducibly enhanced the sensitivity to X-rays (Table 1). The hatching rate of the F1 progeny from drh-3(RNAi) animals without X-ray irradiation was 32.5% due to embryonic lethality induced by RNAi alone; however, the viability of F1 progeny from irradiated drh-3(RNAi) animals markedly decreased to 0.6% (Table 3). A similar X-ray hypersensitivity was observed in rad-51(RNAi) animals, in which DNA double-strand break repair and meiotic homologous recombination were suppressed.36,37 X-ray-induced growth retardation was also observed in the F1 progeny from drh-3(RNAi) animals. The F1 progeny from drh-3(RNAi) and gei-17(RNAi) animals without irradiation developed normally. However, F1 larvae from irradiated animals exhibited a slow-growth phenotype (Table 4). The gei-17 gene encodes a putative E3 SUMO ligase that participates in embryonic DNA damage responses in C. elegans, and the gei-17(RNAi) embryo is sensitive to other DNA-damaging agents.38,394. Discussion4.1. Identification of helicase family members and RNAi-based phenotypic analyses in C. elegansThis is the first survey of members of helicase-like genes in C. elegans. In this study, several novel members of helicase family were identified by a systematic BLAST-based homology search, including two plant helicase-like genes of F52G3.3 and F52G3.4 and five C. elegans-specific SNF2-like genes. It should be noted that the current total number of helicase-like genes (134 genes) is tentative. For example, both Y50D7A.2 and a neighboring gene, Y50D7A.11, may be a split single gene encoding the C. elegans ortholog ERCC2 (see the legend of Table 1).In this study, we identified 51 helicase-like genes that are required for viability and/or developmental growth of C. elegans. This percentage (39.5% of 129 genes tested) was significantly higher than the number of phenotype-positive genes from several genome-wide RNAi analyses (∼10%35,40 to 27%41), suggesting the biological importance of helicase-like genes in cellular function. The number of genes required for embryonic development and/or larval growth was variable among the subfamilies. For example, many members of the DEAD-box (63.9% of the members), DEAH-box (54.5%), MCM (100%), and MPH1 (50%) subfamilies exhibited development- and growth-defects by RNAi. In contrast, relatively few of the PIF1 (0%), RECQ (0%), UPF1 (10%), or SWI2/SNF2 (15.4%) subfamily members showed such defects (Supplementary Table S3). These results are consistent with our previous phenotypic analysis using knockout strains of yeast helicase-like genes.8 The difference in the incidence of these phenotypes among the subfamilies could be accounted by the biological roles in the members in each subfamily. It is interesting that the suppressions of half of the genes (dcr-1 and drh-3) in the MPH1 subfamily cause growth-defects or embryonic lethality. This suggests biological importance of RNAi in viability and larval growth in C. elegans because both gene products act in RNAi.42,43 We found some discrepancies in RNAi-induced phenotypes between our experiments and the studies reported in WormBase (Supplementary Table S1). We newly found larval arrest and slow-growth phenotypes caused by C24H12.4 RNAi and Y71G12B.8 RNAi, respectively. C24H12.4 and Y71G12B.8 encode putative homologs of the yeast DEAD-box proteins Dbp9p and Drs1p, respectively. Since both yeast proteins are required for ribosomal RNA biogenesis11,44 and essential for viability in yeast,3,8 our observations on both genes are probably significant (see the legend of Supplementary Table S1 for other discrepancies).4.2. Loss-of-function phenotypes of helicase family members diverged in C. elegansThe putative C. elegans orthologs of yeast helicase-like proteins were identified and are shown in Table 2 with their loss-of-function phenotypes. The MCM subfamily members26 and two RUVB-like proteins45 were completely conserved and required for viability in both species. The DEAD-box, DEAH-box, SKI2, UPF1, and SWI2/SNF2 subfamilies contained two classes of proteins, those that were conserved in both species and those that were species-specific. For example, 21 putative orthologous pairs of the DEAD-box members were well conserved. In contrast, we could not detect any putative nematode homologs corresponding to the four yeast proteins Mrh4p, Dbp3p, Dbp7p, and Mss116p, or any yeast homologs of 15 nematode proteins. Budding yeast contain one or two members of the PIF1, MPH1, RAD3, and RECQ subfamilies; however, the number of members in each of these subfamilies had increased in C. elegans, and many of these divergent proteins are conserved in humans (Table 1). Twenty-five budding yeast-specific proteins and six higher eukaryote-specific proteins were also detected (Table 2). We found a high degree of conservation of loss-of-function phenotypes for homologs in both organisms. The majority (20 of 22 proteins) of putative C. elegans orthologs of yeast essential DEAD-box members caused embryonic lethality or growth-defect phenotypes by their depletion (Table 2). Similar phenotypic conservation of essential homologs in both species was also found in members of the DEAH-box, SKI2, MCM, and RAD3 subfamilies, as well as in the RUVB-like and SSL2-like proteins, suggesting that these putative conserved orthologs play similar essential cellular roles in C. elegans as in their yeast counterparts (Table 2). Interestingly, depletions of the subfamily members which have diverged in C. elegans were rarely able to induce growth-defect phenotypes (i.e. only nine of 67 genes tested across the subfamilies).Because of the detection of diverged members in C. elegans, we assigned all helicase-like genes and pseudogenes to the six C. elegans chromosomes to examine the distribution of the extranumerary genes in the genome. The BLAST-based sequence homology searches identified 10 candidate gene pairs, three highly related gene pairs, and two gene clusters in the helicase-like genes (Supplementary Table S4) and mapped to chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1). Six putative gene pairs (glh-1 and glh-2, glh-4 and T08D2.3, F33D11.10 and Y65B4A.6, F57B9.3 and inf-1, F53H1.1 and Y73B3B.5, and mut-14 and ZC317.1) belonged to the DEAD-box subfamily (Supplementary Fig. S1A). At least two partners of the paired genes were pseudogenes (T08D2.3 and Y73B3B.5). Four pairs of putative duplicated genes were identified among the SWI2/SNF2 (let-418 and chd-3), SKI2 (Y46G5A.4 and Y46G5A.6), PIF1 (C11G6.2 and Y116F11A.1), and MPH1 (drh-1 and drh-2) subfamilies (Supplementary Figs S1C, D, G and H). In addition, two clusters of C. elegans-specific SNF2-like genes and Helitrons in the PIF1 subfamily were found on the terminal regions of chromosomes V and II, respectively, suggesting that these genes might have been generated by a few rounds of gene duplications (Supplementary Figs S1C and G; see the figure legend).RNAi for the subfamily members diverged in C. elegans poorly induced growth-defect phenotypes (Table 2). This phenomenon may indicate a functional redundancy with paralogous proteins or diverged members in C. elegans. In fact, two diverged DEAD-box members, GLH-1 and GLH-4, are known to play redundant functions in germline development. Kuznicki et al.46 showed that double RNAi for glh-1/4 was required for significant sterile phenotype. Since some of paired proteins (e.g. LET-418 and CHD-3) have redundant functions,47 we assumed that the products of duplicated genes with unknown function (i.e. Y67D2.6 and Y108F1.5, or C11G6.2 and Y116F11A.1) may be the case. However, none of the detectable phenotypes in animals treated with double RNAi for these paired genes were observed (data not shown).4.3. Expression profiles of helicase-like genes in C. elegans and influence of RNAi for germline- enriched genesWe examined the expression profiles of the helicase-like genes, using four published genome-wide expression studies of C. elegans genes48–51 (Supplementary Table S2). Reinke et al.51 identified germline-enriched and sex-regulated genes and classified the genes into several expression categories. Assignment of helicase-like genes in each subfamily to each expression category revealed that many helicase-like genes (58 of 134 genes) were categorized as ‘intrinsic’ and ‘oogenesis-enriched’ genes (Supplementary Table S5A). The fraction of helicase-like genes (21.6%) in the oogenesis-enriched category is significantly higher than that of C. elegans genes in general (5.7% of the total genes), suggesting an expression bias for helicase family members in oogenesis in hermaphrodites. Dominant expression of helicase-like genes in the embryonic stages was also detected in another study50 (Supplementary Table S5B). The data reported by Jiang et al.48 show sex-biased expression of the helicase-like genes (12.7% of helicase-like genes versus 27.6% of total C. elegans genes in male; 32.1 versus 24.7% in hermaphrodites in Supplementary Table S5C). This is also consistent with the high proportion of helicase-like genes in the oogenesis-enriched genes. Assignment of the helicase-like genes to the C. elegans gene expression map49 also indicates that helicase-like genes were relatively concentrated (1.9- to 4.2-fold) in six mountains (2, 5, 7, 11, 20, and 25) out of 46 mountains, and mountains 2, 7, and 11 contain predominantly oocyte- and germline-enriched genes49 (Supplementary Table S6). In addition, the dominant expression of PIF1 or SKI2 members in males is interesting, because three of three and three of six genes in the PIF1 and SKI2 subfamilies, respectively, appeared in the ‘male dominant groups’ (Supplementary Table S5C), and this may implicate these genes in male-specific functions such as spermatogenesis. Most Helitrons of the PIF1 members were poorly expressed in the aforementioned studies.Since oogenesis-enriched expression of many helicase-like genes suggests potential roles of their gene products in the development and proliferation of germ cells, we examined the effect of suppression of 39 germline-enriched genes on brood size by RNAi, and reduced reproductive capacity in F55F8.2(RNAi) and T05E8.3(RNAi) animals was detected (Supplementary Table S2). F55F8.2 encodes a homolog of yeast-splicing factor Prp28p, and the T05E8.3 gene product is similar to yeast Prp22p and a putative homolog of human DHX33 (Table 1). This indicates that both gene products play important roles in the reproduction in C. elegans. In the L1 RNAi analysis, suppression of F56D2.6 and C08F8.2 caused a significant reduction in brood size because of sterility in P0 animals and of embryonic lethality, respectively, suggesting that F56D2.6, encoding a putative homolog of yeast-splicing factor Prp43p, is required for reproduction, and as a putative homolog of yeast mitochondrial RNA helicase Suv3p, C08F8.2 plays an essential role in embryonic viability. In the previous study by Colaiacovo et al.,52 four helicase-like genes have been identified in an RNAi-based screen for genes involved in chromosome morphogenesis and nuclear organization in C. elegans germline. We also found several detectable phenotypes in dcr-1(RNAi) and ruvb-2(RNAi) animals, but did not find weak phenotypes reported in rha-1(RNAi) and C27B7.4(RNAi) animals (Table 1).4.4. Identification of drh-3 gene involved in resistance to X-ray-induced DNA damageIn this study, we succeeded in identifying D2005.5(drh-3) as a gene for protection against X-ray irradiation. Four Dicer-like proteins in the MPH1 subfamily, including DRH-3, have recently been shown to play an important role in RNAi.43 It remains to be resolved why depletion of the RNAi factor DRH-3 causes X-ray hypersensitivity in C. elegans. Previous RNAi-based studies have shown that some helicase family members are implicated in resistance to X-ray-induced DNA damage. Boulton et al.53 showed that RNAi of rad-54 and Y116A8C.13 caused DNA repair defect phenotypes. Recently, van Haaften et al.54 performed a genome-wide screen for C. elegans genes that protect cells against ionizing radiation to identify three helicase-like genes D2005.5, Y80D3A.2, and isw-1. Although D2005.5 was commonly detected in the screens by us and van Haaften et al., we failed to find marked X-ray-dependent phenotypic defects in the progeny of Y80D3A.2(RNAi) or isw-1(RNAi) animals (Table 1). Several genes including rad-54 or RecQ-like helicase genes are thought to be involved in DNA repair of X-ray-induced DNA damage; however, these genes were not always detected in previous RNAi-based screens. In order to isolate more candidate genes, several technical improvements in the screens may be required, including more sensitive assay systems (e.g. use of reporter animals55), RNAi-based screens using rrf-3 mutants,34 or soaking RNAi-mediated screens.41In conclusion, we have identified helicase-like genes in C. elegans and characterized loss-of-function phenotypes of these genes. The results obtained from phenotypic analyses, comparative analyses, chromosome mapping, and a study of the expression patterns of helicase family members will be useful for studying helicase-mediated molecular reactions governing dynamic regulation of DNA, RNA, and chromatin. Furthermore, characterization of DRH-3 will elucidate functional interactions between the resistance to X-ray irradiation and RNAi.Supplementary materialSupplementary Data: Supplementary data are available online at dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (No. 17590057), on Priority Areas Genome Biology, and the 21st Century COE Program Ecological Engineering for Homeostatic Human Activities, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (T.E.), the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP-RGP0012/2004-C), and Solution Oriented Research for Science and Technology from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (J071501010) (F.H.), and the special research program of the Toyohashi University of Technology, the Naito Foundation, and the REIMEI Research Resources of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (T.E.).We would like to thank Drs A.

For example, the GC content of bacterial genomes has been shown to influence the amino acid composition of the proteome.2,3In addition to the variations in GC content, however, bacterial genomes can also show significant compositional asymmetry between the two DNA strands.4,5 This strand asymmetry is usually measured as GC or AT skew6 (see Methods) and it can be due to such factors as different substitutional patterns between the leading and lagging strands during replication.4,7,8 By comparing the amino acid compositions of proteins encoded on the leading strand with those encoded on the lagging strand, it has been shown that these nucleotide skews can also affect the amino acid composition of bacterial proteins.9,10Among eukaryotes, the correlations between nucleotide content and amino acid compositions have been studied primarily in animal mitochondrial genomes. Animal mitochondria show considerable variation between species in both GC content and GC skew.6 It has been shown that the variations in GC content affect the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins11 but the effects of variations in nucleotide skew between genomes have not been studied. The recent availability of a very large number of completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes allows us to fill this gap. Mammalian mitochondria, including those of humans, are characterized by negative GC skews and positive AT skews, i.e. the major coding strand of mammalian mitochondria is relatively rich in the nucleotides C and A, and correspondingly poor in G and T. For instance, as noted by Perna and Kocher (1995),6 although the human mitochondrial genome contains more than 40% GC pairs, the frequency of G on the coding strand is only 5%. The strength of the skew varies between species, and some species of invertebrate show opposite skews to those found in mammals, i.e. the coding strand is rich in G and poor in C.6In recent years, there has been an explosion of data on mitochondrial whole genome sequences. Since our goal was to measure the effect of strand asymmetry on amino acid composition, we chose a group of species, the Platyhelminthes (flatworms), in which the GC and AT skews are opposite to those seen in mammals.12,13 Among the flatworms, the coding sequences are rich in G and T and correspondingly poor in C and A, i.e. a complete contrast to the patterns seen in mammals. For example, the main mitochondrial coding strand in Schistosoma mansoni (a flatworm) contains only 6.7% C, but it contains 25% G.12 Despite the contrasting GC and AT skew patterns, however, both mammals and flatworms contain essentially the same set of homologous mitochondrial genes and they span similar ranges of GC content. Thus a comparison between these two groups provides us with an opportunity to assess the potential effects of DNA strand bias on the amino acid composition of a well-characterized set of orthologous proteins.2. MethodsWe downloaded all of the publicly available complete mitochondrial (mt) genome (mtDNA) sequences from both mammals and Platyhelminthes from the NCBI RefSeq organelle genome database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ORGANELLES/mztax_short.html) (released in July, 2006). There were a total of 170 mt genomes from mammals and 13 mt genomes from Platyhelminthes (Supplementary Table S1).The nucleotide frequencies and compositional biases of mtDNA sequences were calculated from the ‘ + ’-strand (the major coding strand used by NCBI for annotation) for each species. The GC and AT asymmetry is measured in terms of GC- and AT-skews according to the following formulae given in Perna and Kocher6: GC-skew = (G−C)/(G + C); AT-skew = (A − T)/(A + T), where C, G, A, and T are the occurrences of the four nucleotides.We predicted the amino acid compositions based on the mitochondrial genetic code (Table 1) by partitioning the mitochondrial codons into CA-rich codons, GT-rich codons, and other codons. The frequency of synonymous codon usage was measured by the nucleotide content of G + T or C + A at the third codon positions of fourfold degenerate codon families: GGN (Glycine), GTN (Valine), CGN (Arginine), ACN (Threonine), GCN (Alanine), and CCN (Proline) (Supplementary Fig. S1).Partition of the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code into GT-rich, CA-rich and ‘other’ codonsGT-rich codons (italic) include GT, TG, GG, TT codons at the first two codon positions. TTA and TTG are excluded as there are other codons for Leu. CA-rich codons (bold) include CA, AC, CC, AA codons at the first two codon positions. Different codon assignments in Mammals and Platyhelminthes are underlined. In Platyhelminthes, AGA and AGG code for Ser, ATA for Ile, and AAA for Asn. The numbers following each codon are codon usage per thousand codons in the 11 conserved proteins of mammals (the first number) and Platyhelminthes (the second number).Partition of the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code into GT-rich, CA-rich and ‘other’ codonsGT-rich codons (italic) include GT, TG, GG, TT codons at the first two codon positions. TTA and TTG are excluded as there are other codons for Leu. CA-rich codons (bold) include CA, AC, CC, AA codons at the first two codon positions. Different codon assignments in Mammals and Platyhelminthes are underlined. In Platyhelminthes, AGA and AGG code for Ser, ATA for Ile, and AAA for Asn. The numbers following each codon are codon usage per thousand codons in the 11 conserved proteins of mammals (the first number) and Platyhelminthes (the second number).The statistical significance of the average differences in amino acid composition between the two groups of species was scored using a Student's t-test.3. Results and discussionWe first confirmed the published reports (see Introduction) of contrasting GC and AT skews in the mitochondria of mammals and flatworms. As can be seen from Fig. 1, there is a negative GC skew, and a positive AT skew, in the major coding strand among the mammalian species, whereas the opposite is true among the flatworms. Despite the variations between species within both groups, there is a large average difference between them and this difference between the groups is statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001). As previously noted by Perna and Kocher6 and Le et al.,12 the major coding sequence of mammalian mtDNA is relatively rich in C and A, whereas G and T are much more common in the flatworm coding sequences.Contrasting patterns of DNA strand asymmetry in the mitochondrial coding sequences of mammals and Platyhelminthes. (A) The GC skew, (G − C)/(G + C), is negative for all mammalian species (shown in blue), and positive for all Platyhelminthe species (shown in red). (B) The AT skew, (A − T)/(A + T), is positive for mammals (shown in blue) and negative for Platyhelminthes (shown in red).Contrasting patterns of DNA strand asymmetry in the mitochondrial coding sequences of mammals and Platyhelminthes. (A) The GC skew, (G − C)/(G + C), is negative for all mammalian species (shown in blue), and positive for all Platyhelminthe species (shown in red). (B) The AT skew, (A − T)/(A + T), is positive for mammals (shown in blue) and negative for Platyhelminthes (shown in red).Despite their differences in strand asymmetry, the major coding strands of the two groups encode essentially the same set of 11 conserved mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome b, three subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (subunit 1, 2, and 3), six subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (subunit 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, and 5), and ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 (ATP6). The exception is that NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) is encoded on the major coding strand in flatworms, but is encoded on the opposite strand in mammals.Given the contrasting patterns of mitochondrial DNA strand asymmetry between these two groups of animals, we wished to investigate if there was a corresponding difference between the two groups in the frequencies of encoded amino acids. Specifically, because of their negative GC skews and positive AT skews (which reduce the frequencies of G and T nucleotides on the coding strand), we expected the mammalian coding strands to encode proteins that are relatively low in the proportions of cysteine (C), Valine (V), phenylalanine (F), Glycine (G), and Tryptophan (W), all of which are encoded by GT-rich codons (Table 1). This is exactly what we observed (Fig. 2A). On average, the combined proportions of these five amino acids among the mammals are approximately half the value observed in the flatworm orthologs. Since these GC and AT skews result in a corresponding enrichment of C and A nucleotides on the mammalian coding strand, we expected the mammalian proteins to show a corresponding relative increase in the proportions of Glutamine (G), Threonine (T), Proline (P), Histidine (H), Asparagine (N), and Lysine (K), all of which are encoded by CA-rich codons. Again, this prediction is borne out (Fig. 2B) and again the average difference between the two groups of species is approximately twofold. Not only are the average differences in the predicted direction, but they are statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001) and they are consistent over all species within each group (see details in Supplementary Table S1). In addition to the consistency over species, there is also a consistency over all amino acids within the two codon groups. These differences are surprisingly large, given that we are dealing with a set of conserved orthologous proteins. Although taken as a group, the amino acid frequencies show approximately a twofold difference between the two groups (Fig. 2), at the level of individual amino acids, some of these differences are threefold or greater (Fig. 3). Again, the individual amino acid differences shown in Fig. 3 are highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Thus, we can conclude that strand asymmetries at the level of DNA have had a major influence on the composition of these mitochondrial protein sequences.The amino composition of mitochondrial proteins reflects the DNA strand asymmetry. (A) The proportions of cysteine (C), Valine (V), phenylalanine (F), Glycine (G), and Tryptophan (W) are relatively low in mammalian proteins (shown in blue) and relatively high in flatworms (shown in red). These amino acids are encoded by GT-rich codons. (B) The proportions Glutamine (Q), Threonine (T), Proline (P), Histidine (H), Asparagine (N), and Lysine (K) are, in contrast, relatively high in mammals (shown in blue) and relatively low in flatworms (shown in red). These amino acids are encoded by CA-rich codons.The amino composition of mitochondrial proteins reflects the DNA strand asymmetry.

(B) The proportions of Glutamine and Threonine are high in mammals (shown in blue) and low in flatworms (shown in red).These results show that differences in the patterns of strand asymmetry between the coding and template strands of a mitochondrial gene can produce very significant changes in the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins. The magnitude of these changes is comparable to those noted previously by Foster et al.11 for the effects of differences in mitochondrial nucleotide composition, i.e. GC content. It should be noted, however, that the strand asymmetries described in this study do not affect the same subsets of the amino acids as those affected by changes GC content. As an illustrative example, we can compare a single pair of mitochondrial genomes, one mammal and one flatworm, those of the red deer (Cervus elaphus) and the liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica). In both species, the overall nucleotide content of the mitochondrial coding sequences is virtually identical at 38% GC and proportions of GC-rich (GARP) and AT-rich (FYMINK) amino acids (see Foster et al.11 for details) are also very similar between these two species. In other words, their similarity in nucleotide composition is reflected in a similarity in the proportions of GC-rich and AT-rich amino acids. But when we compare the same two species for the levels of CA-rich (QTPHNK) and GT-rich (CVFGW) amino acids, we see large differences reflecting the differences in strand asymmetry between the mammals and the flatworms. For example, the liver fluke proteins contain more than twice as many Valine residues and more than five times as many cysteine residues as do their orthologs in the red deer. On the other hand, the liver flukes have approximately a third as many Glutamines and Threonines as are found in the red deer. These differences are also statistically highly significant (P < 0.001) and they are entirely consistent with what we see for the average differences between mammals and flatworms (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S1).A possible alternative explanation for these results is that the amino acid differences are the cause, rather than the consequence, of the strand asymmetries. We can exclude this possibility, however, for two reasons. First, there is an even larger strand asymmetry at the synonymous codon sites (Supplementary Fig. S1) suggesting that the nucleotide skew is counterbalanced, to some extent, by functional constraint at the protein level. In other words, protein function does have an effect, but as a constraint rather than a cause. Another way to illustrate this point is to calculate the GC skew at each codon position separately. The results (Supplementary Table S2) show that the greatest differences in GC skew occur at the third codon position and the least skew occurs at the second position. This is consistent with the fact that many changes at the third codon position alter the codon usage but do not affect the protein sequence. Secondly, in mammalian mitochondria, one gene (ND6) is encoded on the opposite strand from the other 12 genes and, in accordance with our prediction, the amino acid composition of this mammalian protein displays a pattern that is similar to that of the flatworm proteins rather than the other 12 mammalian proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). Both of these observations indicate that the primary effect is at the level nucleotide asymmetry between the two strands of the mitochondrial genome and that this DNA bias causes a secondary effect at the level of protein composition.We performed a number of further tests to explore the interplay between functional constraint at the protein level and nucleotide skew at the DNA level. Since we limited our comparison to orthologous mitochondrial genes, we have eliminated the effect of different types of proteins in the two groups of species. Moreover, since mitochondrial function is highly conserved in metazoan animals, we expect that the orthologous proteins are performing essentially the same functions in the two species groups. There is still, however, the remote possibility that there are differences in physiological conditions between the mitochondria of mammals and those of flatworms and that these differences could contribute to the differences in protein composition which we observe between the two groups. To control for this possibility, we examined the sequences of three mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes: L11, L15, and L20 (Supplementary Table S2). Although these proteins function in the mitochondria, they are encoded by genes in the nuclear genome. The results show that the gene sequences do not show the characteristic mitochondrial gene skews and there is no significant difference between mammals and Platyhelminthes, either at the DNA level or at the protein level. This indicates that the key factor underlying the species differences is not the functional environment of the proteins but rather the location of the genes encoding those proteins.Since our results point to a mutational force at the DNA level that is counteracted by functional constraint at the protein level, we asked what would happen if we confined our analysis to a region of the protein where there was reason to believe that the functional constraint would be especially strong. The transmembrane domain portions of mitochondrial proteins provide an opportunity to do such an analysis. Specifically, we looked at the patterns of GC skew and amino acid composition in the transmembrane domain regions of the COXI gene. The results (Supplementary Table S2) show that the increased functional constraint on amino acid composition does indeed lead to a decreased difference in GC skew between the two species groups. For example, the difference in GC skew between mammals and flatworms for the complete dataset is 0.84, whereas it is reduced to 0.57 for the transmembrane domains, but the same pattern remains both at the DNA and protein levels. For instance, even within the transmembrane domains, the mammalian sequences have less cysteine and valine, and more glutamine and threonine than do their flatworm orthologs, reflecting the same patterns as shown in Figure 3. In other words, increased functional constraint decreases the effect of nucleotide skew, but it does not completely eliminate it.Overall, our results show that the DNA strand asymmetry of animal mitochondrial genomes affects the amino acid composition of encoded proteins. A similar effect has been noted previously in bacterial genomes9,10 but it has not been reported in animal or plant genomes. Since we infer that the DNA strand bias is the cause rather than the consequence of the protein differences, this raises the question of what causes the DNA strand bias in the first place. In bacterial genomes, there is good evidence that it is related to DNA replication, based primarily on the fact that the direction of the bias switches at the origin of replication.4,7,8 Recent work indicates that although DNA strand biases are widespread in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses, the magnitude and the direction of the bias is variable, suggesting that the underlying causes are multifactorial.14,15 In animal mitochondrial genomes, the strand bias appears to be caused by varying durations of time that the heavy strand spends in the mutagenic single-strand state during replication.16 In addition to the replication-associated effects, there is evidence that transcription can also generate DNA strand asymmetry in eukaryotes due to transcription-coupled mutations.17,18A recent study has shown that strand bias in mitochondrial sequences can lead to artefactual results in phylogenetic reconstructions.19 This misleading result can be minimized by a recoding scheme that excludes transitions at rapidly evolving neutral sites.19,20 Our results, however, show that mitochondrial strand biases can also have significant effects at non-neutral sites that change the amino acid sequence. This means that some degree of bias remains even after the correction has been implemented. As stated by Jones et al. (2007)20 ‘In the case of mitochondrial genes, strand-bias should be of particular concern and the previous use of mitochondrial genomes in resolving deep phylogenies requires critical re-evaluation’.It remains to be seen if DNA strand asymmetry can also affect the composition of proteins encoded by eukaryotic nuclear genes, as has been shown for biases in the GC content of nuclear genes.21,22 It is already known that DNA strand asymmetries exist in nuclear genes17,18,23,24 but their effects on the composition of nuclear-encoded proteins have not been studied.FundingThis work was supported by a grant to DAH from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 was the first phototrophic organism to be fully sequenced.1 The availability of the complete genome sequence of Synechocystis has drastically changed the strategy for studying genetic systems in cyanobacteria.2 Gene identification and functional assignment have been accelerated utilizing the genome sequence. The genome sequence has also allowed systematic analyses of gene regulation and function on the genomic level. Microarray and proteome analyses have made it possible to monitor the expression of a substantial proportion of genes at both transcriptional and translational levels.3,4 Genetic analyses, such as targeted disruption or random tagging analysis, have suggested many functional links between gene products.2 Two genome databases, CyanoBase and CyanoMutants, have been established and act as centralized information resources.5,6 Based on these material and information resources, Synechocystis provides an ideal model system for genetic studies of photosynthetic organisms.Although a large quantity of data has been accumulated through functional analyses of the genome, many of these analyses were driven by the predicted functions of the annotated genes. Therefore, a limited amount of information is available for unannotated genes. One of the effective approaches to obtain information regarding the function of these uncharacterized proteins is an analysis of protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Since nearly half of the predicted gene products of Synechocystis remain unannotated, a systematic approach for analysis of PPIs is needed.We conducted a large-scale analysis of Synechocystis PPIs using a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) system. YTH analysis is one of the well-established methods to detect binary protein interactions and is feasible for large-scale analysis. Large-scale YTH screens have been conducted in a wide range of organisms and have provided several important biological and bioinformatics platforms for the study of protein networks in different organisms.7–13 These analyses have also successfully placed functionally uncharacterized proteins in their biological context.In this study, we applied the YTH approach to three major target gene groups. For the initial screening, we selected genes of two-component signal transducers in order to evaluate our YTH screening system, as well as to elucidate the two-component signal transduction pathways in Synechocystis. The two-component signal transduction system generally consists of a histidine kinase (Hik) and a response regulator (Rre), and signal transduction is achieved by phosphorylation as a result of the interaction between cognate pairs of Hiks and Rres. Since the interactions of Hiks and Rres are binary, these two-component signal transducers are suitable targets for evaluation using the YTH screening system. On the Synechocystis chromosome, 44 putative genes for Hiks and 42 genes for Rres are predicted.1,14,15 In contrast to the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis genomes, in which most of the genes for cognate pairs of Hiks and Rres are located close to each other, many of the genes for Hiks and Rres in Synechocystis are distributed randomly in the chromosome. Among 44 genes for Hiks on the Synechocystis chromosome, 14 are located in the vicinity of genes for potential cognate Rres, whereas other 30 are not located near any genes for Rres.15 Therefore, identification of PPIs between two-component signal transducers will provide valuable information to elucidate the cognate pairs of Hiks and Rres and signal transduction pathways in Synechocystis.For the second screening group, we selected Synechocystis genes whose homologues are conserved in the A. thaliana genome with the aim to obtain interaction information that is applicable to plant genes of cyanobacterial origin as well as Synechocystis genes. Chloroplasts are descendants of free-living cyanobacteria that became endsymbionts. In the course of the evolutionary processes that transformed the cyanobacterial symbiont into an organelle, chloroplasts have donated many genes to nuclear chromosomes.16 Martin et al.17 reported that approximately 1700 of 9369 A. thaliana genes that were investigated are of cyanobacterial origin and these encompass all functional categories. PPI information on Synechocystis genes conserved in plants would provide useful insights for functional analysis of plant genes of cyanobacterial origin, since Synechocystis has been used as a model for analysis of these plant genes.For the third screening group, we selected genes of unknown function in order to obtain interaction data that could be used to predict function. Since approximately 60% of the Synechocystis genes of unknown function have putative orthologues in at least one of the cyanobacteria whose genome sequence is available, the data obtained from a screen of Synechocystis genes will be applicable to other cyanobacteria.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of bait clonesThe yeast genetic techniques and media used in this study have been described in previous reports.8,18For the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-fusion (bait) vector, we constructed pAS2-1-Asc I by inserting an Asc I site between the Nco I and Eco RI sites of pAS2-1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Specific primer sets were designed for the target region of each Synechocystis gene, and an Asc I site was added to the 5′ end of each gene-specific forward primer. Target gene fragments were obtained by PCR amplification from cosmid clones or genomic DNA using the gene specific primer sets. To minimize potential misincorporation during PCR, the high-fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used. The resulting fragments were subjected to Asc I digestion and ligated into pAS2-1-Asc I predigested with Asc I and Sma I. The target genes cloned into pAS2-1-AscI (bait clone) were transformed into the yeast strains CG1945 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL417-mers(x3)-CYC1TATA-lacZ) or AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, MEL1, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).2.2. Library constructionThe genomic DNA of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 was subjected to sonication followed by size-fractionation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The 0.5−2.0 kb fraction was cloned into the Sma I digested activation domain-fusion (prey) vector, pACT2 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and transformed into E. coli (XLI-Blue; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The library DNA isolated from 106 independent clones was then introduced into the yeast strain Y187 (MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, met−, gal80Δ, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ, MEL1) using standard lithium acetate-mediated procedures.19 Three million independent yeast colonies were collected, pooled, and stored at −80°C.2.3. Two-hybrid screening procedurePrior to screening, the self-activity of each bait clone was tested by mating with the Y187 strain harboring an empty pACT2 vector and then plating on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ medium supplemented with 2.5, 5, or 10 mM 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Each bait clone was then mated with the prey library containing approximately 1.6 × 107 clones and plated on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ agar medium supplemented with the optimal concentration of 3-AT based on the results of the self-activity test. After 7 days of growth at 30°C, independent positive colonies were collected in 96-well plates and cultured for an additional 3 days at 30°C. Aliquots of cultured positive clones were used for β-galactosidase assays and DNA sequencing of the prey inserts, and the cultures were stored at −80°C. The collected positive clones were treated with a zymolyase solution [2.5 mg/mL Zymolyase-100T (Seikagaku America Inc., East Falmouth, MA, USA), 1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1 M Na phosphate, pH 7.4] for 30 min at 30°C, and then used as templates for direct amplification of the prey clone inserts using the following primers: T0017 (5′-TACCACTACAATGGATGATG-3′) and T0018 (5′- GGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACG-3′). Amplified inserts were directly sequenced using T0017 (5′) and T0018 (3′) to obtain sequence tags. The sequence tags were subsequently subjected to a BLAST search against the sequence database in CyanoBase (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/) using a semi-automated data processing system. A web-based interface was created to display the search results and to support the submission of interaction data into a interaction database. Sequence tags corresponding to antisense or intergenic regions were discarded. Sequence tags corresponding to the sense strand of an ORF were selected as PPI candidates. The PPI candidates were selected not only from in-frame prey clones (phase 2 position) but also out-of-frame fusion positions for the following reasons. PPIs supported by both in-frame and out-of-frame fusion prey clones have occasionally been found, and translational frameshifting has been reported and biochemically confirmed in previous YTH analyses.18,20 Similarly, the prey sequence tags corresponding to the up-stream region of a gene (within 200 nucleotides) were selected as PPI candidates that may be translated from an upstream start site.2.4. Paralogue search and calculation of IGInformation on genes paralogous to Synechocystis genes was obtained from the CYORF database [http://cyano.genome.ad.jp/]. The lower threshold of acceptability was set at a Smith–Waterman score of 200.Calculation of IG values for each interaction was conducted using the methods described in the previous report.213. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of a high throughput YTH system and selection of Synechocystis genes for screeningOne of the labor intensive steps of YTH analysis is designing the bait clone construction to establish directional and in-frame cloning. To overcome this point, we introduced an Asc I site into the multiple cloning site of a bait vector and used a simplified procedure for bait clone construction, as described in the Materials and Methods. This procedure can be applied to almost all genes in the Synechocystis genome, since there are only five Asc I sites in coding regions.1To increase the efficiency of screening, we used a yeast mating-based screen, as described in the Material and Methods, and used a GAL4 activation domain fusion library of random genomic fragments of Synechocystis sp strain PCC6803. By using the random genomic fragment library as prey clones, information on PPI pairs and interacting domains of the prey proteins can be obtained simultaneously. The selected positive clones were analyzed using a 96-well plate format to increase throughput. For data processing of the large number of sequence tags from positive clones, we developed a semi-automatic system of two programs for vector sequence trimming and blast search against the Synechocystis sequence database. We also created an interface to display the search results and to support submission of interaction data to an interaction database.Using this high-throughput YTH system, we explored large-scale PPI analysis in the photoautotorophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. For bait clones of YTH screening, we selected the following groups of Synechocystis genes: (i) genes of putative two-component signal transducers, (ii) genes whose homologues are conserved in the A. thaliana genome, and (iii) genes of unknown function.For two-component signal transducers, 44 predicted genes for Hiks and 42 predicted genes for Rres were selected.14,15 Selection of Synechocystis genes with homologues in the A. thaliana genome was conducted as follows. First, all A. thaliana genes were compared with those of Synechocystis, E. coli, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans, and the A. thaliana genes with highest degree of sequence similarity to those of Synechocystis were identified. Then by assigning Synechocystis genes corresponding to the identified A. thaliana genes, a total of 657 genes were selected as candidate Synechocystis genes conserved in the A. thaliana genome. The selected genes accounted for 10–50% of each functional category in Synechocystis. In the Synechocystis chromosome, 1641 genes (49%) are still categorized as hypothetical or of unknown function. Among the genes of unknown function, 190 candidate genes were selected because homologues were present in the A. thaliana genome. In addition, 413 genes encoding proteins with multiple transmembrane domains were excluded, because of the difficulty in detecting PPI of transmembrane proteins using the YTH system. Thus, a total of 1038 genes of unknown function were selected as the third screening group. For approximately 70% of these selected function unknown genes, putative orthologues are present in at least one of the completely sequenced cyanobacteria. Altogether a total of 1825 genes, including 44 genes selected for other purposes, were selected as target genes in this study (Fig. 1, Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).Flow chart of the sequential steps used for identification of PPIs of Synechocystis.

Classification and assessment of the protein interaction dataOf the 1825 target genes, bait clones were successfully constructed for 1814 (Fig. 1, Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). The YTH screen detected 3236 independent PPIs from 57% (1037) of the tested bait clones. The PPI network that was obtained contains 1920 Synechocystis proteins (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2).One of the major concerns of large-scale interaction analysis is its reliability. Generally, PPI data sets obtained from YTH analysis, as well as other comprehensive analyses, contain many false positives. Therefore, the detected interactions need to be evaluated. In the case of YTH analysis, promiscuous interaction and self-activation by bait clones are two of the major causes of false positives.20–23 In a large-scale YTH analysis in yeast, Ito et al.8 classified the reliability of the PPI data by the number of interaction sequence tags (ISTs), the pair of tagged sequences, obtained from positive clones. They designated PPI data with more than three IST hits as the core data, and used this data set for construction of an interaction map and data comparison.8 Similar to this method, we classified all detected interactions into four categories (Category A–D), as an indicator of data reliability, based on how many positive prey clones supported the interaction. Category A and Category B comprised interactions supported by multiple positive prey clones with different (A) or identical (B) inserts. Category C comprised interactions supported by a single positive clone. PPI data supported by prey clones which were identified to have interactions with more than 18 different bait clones, i.e. 1% of tested bait clones, were considered to be promiscuous interactions and grouped in Category D. Most of the PPIs classified in Category D are likely to be false positives. Although there was no clear common feature among the 15 proteins classified as promiscuous prey, four of them had multiple trans-membrane domains and two contained a protein domain previously shown to interact promiscuously (Supplementary Table 3).24,25 The proportion of genes in each category is shown in Table 2.Classification of interaction categoryClassification of interaction categoryTo assess the validity of our categorizations, we evaluated all the detected interactions using an IG measure, a method for computationally assessing the reliability of PPI.21 Interactions with lower IG values are more likely to be reliable than interactions with higher IG values. The IG values for all detected interactions ranged from 1 to 17 and the average IG value was 2.4. When we extracted interactions having an IG value <3, approximately 90% of interactions from Categories A, B, and C were included, whereas only 44% of of interactions from Category D were included (Supplementary Fig. 1). The average IG values of Categories A (2.00 ± 0.16), B (1.87 ± 0.08), and C (2.01 ± 0.33) were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that of Category D (5.42 ± 0.08) when fifty independent interactions were selected randomly from each category and compared. This result suggests that the interaction Categories A–D appropriately indicate the reliability of the PPI data.To minimize false positives caused by self-activation, we used multiple reporter genes driven by different GAL4-responsive promoters and carefully determined the level of self-activation of each bait clone (see Materials and Methods). As shown in Supplementary Table 4, a total of 363 bait clones displayed strong self-activation as they could not be suppressed by leaky HIS3 reporter gene expression even in the presence of 10 mM 3-AT and these clones were eliminated from the screen. To examine the protein domains responsible for self-activation, we examined the protein domains of the genes that showed self-activation. Bacterial regulatory protein domains, such as the response regulator receiver (IPR001789) and TPR-1 (IPR001440), were frequently identified among the annotated proteins (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, several domains of unknown function, such as DUF29 (IPR002636) and UPF0150 (IPR005357), were occasionally observed among the proteins of unknown function that showed self-activation.Another feature of large-scale YTH analyses is the high frequency of false negatives or missed interactions. The precise proportion of false-negative interactions can be assessed by comparison with published data. However, this approach is difficult to apply to Synechocystis PPI analysis because of the limited data available regarding protein interactions in Synechocystis. As an alternative, we estimated the proportion of false-negatives based on the interactions of two-component signal transducers whose interaction can be expected by the location of the corresponding genes in the genome. Among 14 Hiks located in the vicinity of genes for potentially cognate Rres in the Synechocystis genome, seven pairs were detected in our screening, indicating that about 50% of the interactions may not have been detected in our analysis. Considering that the two-component signal transducers were extensively analyzed during this study, the false-negative rate among other bait clones could be higher.3.3. General features of protein interactionsA global view of the protein interaction network is illustrated in Fig. 2A using Cytoscape 2.2 (http://www.cytoscape.org/).26 In Fig. 2A, protein disks and interaction lines are color-coded according to functional categories and interaction categories, respectively. The 1920 proteins involved in this interaction network includes proteins from all functional categories in Synechocystis (Fig. 2B).Global view of the PPIs of Synechocystis. (A) All detected PPIs.

The percentages represent the proportion of interacting genes in each function category.Prokaryotic genes are generally organized into operons in which a gene cluster is transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Several previous works have demonstrated that genes encoded in the same operon are likely to have related functions.27,28 In the PPI data obtained here, we found 44 interacting protein pairs that are encoded by genes mapped to adjacent loci in the Synechocystis genome (Supplementary Table 5). It is noteworthy that 31 of these 44 PPIs were classified in Category A and the frequency of Category A PPIs occurring between proteins encoded by adjacent genes is significantly higher than that of the entire network (Table 2). This result supports the validity of our evaluation of the protein interaction data by interaction category. These interactions contained six interacting pairs between annotated proteins and proteins of unknown function mapping to adjacent loci. Two of these interactions were between extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors and their immediate downstream gene products, SigI (Sll0687)–Sll0688 and SigG (Slr1545)–Slr1546. ECF sigma factor is usually transcribed by one or more negative regulators (anti-sigma factors) which bind and inhibit the cognate sigma factor.29 Therefore, these PPI data suggest that the hypothetical proteins Sll0688 and Slr1546 may function as anti-sigma factors.We detected 110 self-interacting proteins (Supplementary Table 6). Of these, 34 were proteins with functional annotations, and some are known to execute their function as homo-multimers or multi-protein complexes containing homo-dimers, such as the 10 kD chaperonin (Slr2075) and nitrogen regulatory protein P-II (Ssl0707). However, more than half of the self-interacting proteins detected in this screen were categorized as hypothetical or unknown. This information on the self-interaction of uncharacterized proteins will further our understanding of the function of these proteins. Domain level analysis of the uncharacterized self-interacting proteins revealed that five of the proteins have domains that are known to be involved in PPIs, such as ribbon–helix–helix (IPR10985) and the HxlR type helix–turn–helix, (IPR002577). Furthermore, a protein domain of unknown function, DUF820 (IPR008538), was found in nine of the self-interacting proteins and, thus, we hypothesize that this domain is involved in PPIs.We also identified 15 hetero-dimeric interactions that occurred between two paralogous proteins (Smith–Waterman score >200). Among these interactions, seven were between proteins of unknown function, and these proteins also tended to be self-interacting. For instance, Slr1152, which showed self-interaction, interacted with a paralogous protein Sll1446. Also among the proteins containing the DUF820 domain (IPR008538) described above, the paralogous interactions Sll1250–Sll0296 and Sll1250–Sll1355 were detected in addition to the self-interactions of Sll0296 and Sll1355. These results suggest that a duplication of self-interacting proteins can generate a pair of paralogous proteins that interact with each other. Similar tendencies have been identified in PPI networks of yeast and other eukaryotes.303.4. Interactions of two-component signal transducersA total of 105 bait clones corresponding to 86 genes of two-component signal transducers were constructed, since genes longer than 2.5 kb were divided into two or more constructs. After removal of 23 self-active bait clones, 82 bait clones were used for screening. A total of 195 PPIs were obtained from 54 bait clones. Among these PPI data, 44 interactions were between two component signal transducers, including seven pairs of bidirectional interactions and six self-interactions (Fig. 3). Of these, we successfully identified seven putative cognate pairs of Hiks and Rres predicted by genome location. Among the 10 PPIs detected between these cognate pairs, six were classified in Category A, and three putative cognate pairs were supported by bidirectional PPIs (Fig. 3). Detection of putative cognate pairs of Hiks and Rres as relatively reliable interactions indicates the validity of this screening approach and the specificity of our YTH analysis. Moreover, 21 of the identified PPIs between Hiks and Rres corresponded to 19 Hik and Rre pairs that were localized to different regions of the Synechocystis genome (Fig. 3). Since it is difficult to know the specific functional Hik and Rre partners from their sequence, the interaction pairs obtained by this study provide evidence to reinforce the functional relationships of the putative cognate pairs of Hiks and Rres and enabled us to identify the functional partners of Hiks and Rres that were localized to different regions of the Synechocystis genome.Interaction pairs of two-component signal transducers. Sensory histidine kinases, hybrid sensory kinases, and response regulators are shown by blue, purple, and orange boxes, respectively. Boxes marked with a red line indicate the interaction between Hik and Rre encoded by putative cognate pairs. The arrow in each interaction indicates the direction of bait protein to prey protein and the reliability of each interaction.Interaction pairs of two-component signal transducers.

Boxes marked with a red line indicate the interaction between Hik and Rre encoded by putative cognate pairs. The arrow in each interaction indicates the direction of bait protein to prey protein and the reliability of each interaction.In addition to the 31 interactions between Hiks and Rres, nine interactions within Hiks were detected. Among the interactions within Hiks, five PPIs were obtained between a sensor kinase and hybrid sensory kinases, which contain both transmitter and receiver domains and are involved in multistep phospho-relays.14,31 As a result, candidates for a putative multistep phospho-relay were identified as Hik15 (Sll1353)–Hik19 (Sll1905)–Rre41 (Slr1305).Interactions between two-component transducers were detected not only as simple one-to-one interactions between Hiks and Rres, but also as interactions between multiple Hiks and a single Rre, and vice versa. These interactions could reflect cross-regulation occurring between multiple two-component signal transducers. The possibility of cross-regulation in two-component signal transduction systems has been proposed previously.32,33 In Synechocystis, the presence of cross-regulation has been demonstrated experimentally. Detailed analysis of Hiks using a series of gene-knockout libraries revealed that Hik33 (Sll0698) regulates several different sets of genes by interacting with deferent Rres in response to low-temperature stress, hyperosmotic stress, and salt stress signals.15,34–36 Although we failed to identify interactions between Hik33 (Sll0698) and Rres, the PPI data obtained for multiple Hiks and Rres will help to elucidate novel cross-regulation in two-component systems in Synechocystis.3.5. Interactions of proteins encoded by genes conserved in the plant genomeAmong 657 genes selected as candidates that are conserved in the A. thaliana genome, a total of 557 bait clones were used for screening (98 self-active clones and two failed constructs were removed). A total of 1281 PPIs were obtained from 380 bait clones. Among these interactions, 30% (389) were PPIs between the products of the selected 657 genes (Supplementary Fig. 2). These PPI data between the products of candidate genes conserved in the A. thaliana genome will be useful in functional analysis of plant genes of endosymbiont cyanobacterial origin. An example of the applicable PPI information is the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) complex. ACCase is essential for fatty acid synthesis in both Synechocystis and plants. Many plants have two types of ACCases in two subcellular locations, a eukaryotic homomeric form in the cytoplasm and a prokaryotic heteromeric form in the chloroplast.37 The plant heteromeric form of ACCase is considered to be of cyanobacterial origin, and is composed of four subunits, a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), biotin carboxylase (BC), and the α and β subunits of carboxyltransferase (CT). The plant heteromeric form of ACCase easily dissociates into two components, the α and β subunits of CT and a BC–BCCP complex.37 Consistent with the physiological properties of the plant heteromeric ACCase, the PPIs in Synechocystis were found between AccB (Slr0435: encoding BCCP) and AccC (Sll0053: encoding BC), and between AccA (Sll0728: encoding the CT α subunit) and AccD (Sll0336: encoding the CT β subunit). These results demonstrate the applicability of the PPI data to the study of plant genes of cyanobacterial origin. Additionally, the results also indicate the advantage of YTH analysis in detecting basal binary interactions among multi-subunit complex components as well as the limitations in detecting secondary interactions in the multi-subunit complex.An example of applicable PPI information was also obtained from that of conserved hypothetical proteins. A bidirectional interaction was detected between the hypothetical YCF65 protein (Slr0923) and the 30S ribosomal protein S1 (Slr1356). The A. thaliana protein PSRP-3 encoded by a homologue of the ycf65 gene on the nuclear genome has previously been identified as a component of the 30S subunit of the chloroplast ribosome by comprehensive proteome analysis of the chloroplast ribosome.38 Therefore, the PPI obtained between YCF65 (Slr0923) and the 30S ribosomal protein S1 (Slr1356) provides important experimental evidence revealing the functional conservation between cyanobacteria and plants, and also supports the hypothesis that Psrp-3/ycf65 may be a gene transferred from the organelle genome to the nuclear genome during chloroplast evolution.383.6. Interactions of proteins of unknown functionWhen 1228 genes of unknown function were screened (including 190 genes screened as conserved genes), 2029 PPIs were obtained from 682 bait clones (54%). Among these interactions, 1104 PPIs from 525 bait clones interacted with proteins of known function. PPI data on proteins of known function were also obtained as prey clones during the course of screening. In the entire PPI network obtained in this study, 1022 proteins of unknown function were included (Table 3). Of these, 727 have at least one partner of known function and 104 showed interactions with two or more known proteins of the same functional category (Table 3). For example, Slr0978 interacts with four distinct hybrid type Hiks (Hik22, Hik24, Hik38, and Hik40), which are paralogues with common domains, suggesting that Slr0978 may be involved in multiple two component signal transduction pathways. Sll0269 and Slr1636 interacted with two methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, Sll0041 and Slr1044, and Sll0041 and Sll1294, respectively. Thus Sll0269 and/or Slr1636 may play roles in the chemotaxis signaling pathway.Summary of interaction with protein of unknown functionSummary of interaction with protein of unknown functionThe obtained PPI information regarding genes of unknown function expands our knowledge of known pathways by identifying novel interacting components of the pathways. For instance, interaction between the nitrogen regulatory protein PII (GlnB; Ssl0707) and a function unknown protein (Sll0985, now designated PamA) indicates the need for further analysis of Sll0985 in the PII signaling pathway. A detailed analysis using a pamA deletion mutant revealed that PamA plays a role in the control of transcript abundance of nitrogen-related and sugar catabolic genes.39 Thus, the PPI information obtained in this study will provide useful starting points for further detailed functional analyses to expand the knowledge of known pathways and to place functionally uncharacterized proteins in their biological context.We have established a YTH screening system feasible for large-scale analysis of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, and have identified 3236 interactions involving 1920 proteins using 1825 selected genes as bait in this screen. The obtained interaction network contains numbers of proteins encoded by genes conserved in plant genomes, as wells as many genes of unknown function. Thus, these data should provide new insights and novel strategies for functional analysis of genes in Synechocystis, and, additionally, genes in other cyanobacteria and plant genes of cyanobacterial origin. To make the interaction data publicly available, the obtained PPI data have been integrated into the cyanobacterial genome database, CyanoBase (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/). We have provided all the PPI data, as well as the interaction categories so that the user can select a data set based on particular analysis needs.Although it will be essential to confirm and extend our findings by independent tests, we believe that the obtained PPI data should provide a useful starting point for studying the functions of uncharacterized proteins and for predicting functional pathways in Synechocystis, other cyanobacteria, and plant.FundingThis work was supported by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation.We would like to thank S.

Introduction Many complex traits of medical and agricultural importance, such as blood pressure, diabetes, crop yield, and plant stress resistance, are controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). 1 , 2 The phenotypic variation of a complex trait usually results from multiple QTLs, QTL–QTL interactions, and QTL–environmental interactions. 3 These complex interactions make identification of individual QTL and QTL interactions difficult. However, recent advances in molecular biology and genomics will now enable us to identify and dissect QTLs related to complex traits in connection with genomic information by employing a statistical method. Once candidate QTLs have been identified, such genetic regions can be broken down into responsible genes by a map-based cloning approach with the aid of DNA markers and genetic linkage maps. 4 The first successful example of gene identification and cloning from a naturally occurring allelic variation was Hd1 , a major QTL responsible for photoperiod sensitivity in rice. 5 Two major approaches have been used to investigate QTLs contributing to complex traits: linkage analysis and association analysis. Linkage analysis exploits the shared inheritance of functional polymorphisms and adjacent markers within families or pedigrees of known ancestry, 1 whereas association analysis is an approach to detect QTL localization based on linkage disequilibrium in unrelated individuals or natural populations. 6 Both these approaches have contributed to our understanding of single QTLs in a great variety of species; however, neither approach can be used to detect interactions among multiple QTLs. Although composite interval mapping (CIM) 7 and multiple QTL mapping (MQM) 8 can identify multiple QTLs by including additional background markers in the model, these approaches can only precisely locate QTLs with significant main effects and do not detect epistatic QTLs. 9 Recently, several approaches for the detection of epigenetic gene interactions have been developed, primarily in the field of human genetics, by application of regression analysis, neural networks, and non-parametric methods. 10 One of the typical approaches is fitting a multiple regression model and, thus, relating the trait values to marker genotypes. 9 , 11–13 In this approach, the number of QTLs in the population by first making estimates based on the Bayesian information criterion and then QTL location and interaction fitting in the model are assumed. The weak point of this approach is that the detection power decreases as the number of parameters increases. So far, identification of presumptive epistatic QTLs using the multiple regression model has been demonstrated only with inter-crossed populations. The other commonly used approach is the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method, which uses non-parametric methods and is most efficiently used with case–control data. 14–16 The MDR method pools multi-locus genotypes into a single dimension with two groups classified as either case or control data. Because this approach was developed for genetic epidemiologists, sequential phenotypic data cannot be adapted to this analysis.  Similar to the multiple regression model and MDR method, other current approaches available for detection of epistatic QTLs have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, some methods are incapable of detecting epistatic QTLs in the absence of main effect QTLs or interactions among more than three loci, and others have not developed software programs for general users. 10 In addition, we recognized a common disadvantage in these current approaches; that is, all of them were developed to generate a best solution (QTL interaction) among numerous candidate interactions, and do not consider relations among subsets of interacting QTLs. Because the final phenotypic value of a complex trait should be determined through multifactor interactions, there may not be just one best interaction in a complex trait, but multiple interactions related to a complex trait. Therefore, we considered that comparison of many QTL interactions at once is vital for a comprehensive understanding of QTL expression affecting a complex trait. In order to reveal QTL interactions and interaction–interaction relationships in complex traits, we have developed a new QTL mapping approach named genotype matrix mapping (GMM), which searches for QTL interactions not only in family data, but also in various genetic backgrounds. In GMM, each marker is given a matrix in which each of the total number of alleles for the marker in the tested population is represented by intersecting lines and rows. QTL interactions are estimated and compared through virtual networks generated among the locus matrixes. In this report, we described the concept of GMM and investigate the efficiency of the concept using a real genotype–phenotype data set.2. Materials and methods2.1. Red clover data set For development and investigation of the GMM algorithm, a real genotype–phenotype data set derived from red clover ( Trifolium pratense L.) was used. Red clover is diploid and the genome size is less than 440 Mb. 17 It is an allogamous species and each variety contains a high level of heterozygosity. 18 A total of 74 red clover individuals originating from ten varieties bred in different countries were used: ‘Natsuyu’ (Japan), ‘Hokuseki’ (Japan), ‘Sapporo’ (Japan), ‘Rannij2’ (Russia), ‘Start’ (Czechoslovakia), ‘Kurano’ (Denmark), ‘Renova’ (Switzerland), ‘Merviot’ (Belgium), ‘Kenland’ (USA) and ‘Altaswede’ (Canada). Genomic DNA was extracted from five to eight individuals of each variety and subjected to PCR examination using 106 primer pairs for selected microsatellite markers distributed throughout the genome. 17 The presence or absence of amplification and differences in fragment size were scored as different alleles. For phenotype data, the flowering date was estimated for each individual grown under conditions of 20°C and an 18 h light/6 h dark cycle in a greenhouse. The possibility of population structure in the tested 74 individuals was estimated by the ‘Structure’ (version 2.0) program with the following parameters: length of burning period = 10 000, Number of MCMC population in the burning period = 1000 ( http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/software.html ). 19 Phenotype values for red clover flowering date were distributed over 26 days (Fig.  1 A). The average number of alleles per marker was 6.5, and the range was between 2 and 10 (Fig.  1 B). The number of genotypes (observed two allele combinations per marker) ranged from 2 to 31 (Fig.  1 C). The absence of population structure was confirmed by comparison of Ln P ( D ) = −22476.9 ( K = 1) and Ln P ( D ) = −22507.9 ( K = 2). A schematic view of the dataset is presented in Fig.  2 .

Genotype matrix mapping To carry out our analysis, we used a newly developed program written in C++ language. This program uses the obtained marker genotypes and the phenotypes of the individuals as its input data set (Fig.  2 ), and extracts all significant QTLs and QTL interactions in an exhaustive manner without omission. The results are available in a computer-parsable format and can be converted into graphical presentations, as shown in this report. In contrast to interval mapping, the GMM algorithm does not necessarily require relative genetic distances between markers, since it does not estimate genotypes at putative loci between two flanking marker loci. It uses map information, if available, only for visualizing the results. 3. Results3.1. Central concept of genotype matrix mapping Any type of population, including unrelated individuals, family data, and mapping populations for linkage analysis, can be used for GMM, providing that there is no population structure within the tested data set. The number of alleles in the population should be determined for every marker before analysis. Next, each marker is given a virtual matrix, named a genotype matrix (GM), in which line and row numbers are allotted based on the total number of alleles for the marker in the population (Fig.  3 A). For example, when the number of alleles of ‘Marker A’ is five, ‘Marker A’ is given half a 5 × 5 matrix covering all possible allele combinations. Individual genotypes are plotting onto the matrix. For example, ‘Individual X’ with genotype ‘ab’ for ‘Marker A’, plots to the cell where line ‘a’ and row ‘b’ intersect. The estimated existence of a significant relationship between genotype and phenotype values based on analysis of variance (ANOVA), as in association analysis, is determined when a number of individuals are plotted to the same cell. Allelic interaction between ‘a’ and ‘b’ on ‘Marker A’ is estimated by comparison the phenotype distribution of ‘aa’, ‘ab’, and ‘bb’ cells on the GM of ‘Marker A’. Additionally, the general effect of allele ‘a’ can be estimated by comparison the phenotypes among all the cells in ‘line a’.  Schematic representation of GM and GMN.

( A ) A virtual matrix given for ‘Marker A’, which is composed of five alleles. The pink cell indicates the ‘ab’ genotype. ( B ) Detection of marker locus interactions by virtual networks among multiple matrices. Red, orange, and green lines indicate interactions which influence the phenotype to various extent (see text).  Finally, virtual networks created by through multiple GMs, named genotype matrix networks (GMNs), connected by each cell are generated. When a particular network indicates a significant relationship to the phenotype, the marker–allele combinations assigned on the GMs are considered a QTL interaction combination. In the example in Fig.  3 B, the combination of Marker A(ab)–Marker B(bc)–Marker C(bd) strongly influences the phenotype (red line), the combination of Marker A(ab)–Marker B(ac)–Marker C(bd) has an intermediate influence (orange line), and the combination of Marker A(ab)–Marker B(ac)–Marker C(ae) has a weak influence (green line). The letters in parentheses indicate allele types. In summary, QTL interactions are identified by finding significant interactions between multiple GMs using GMNs. In theory, the potential number of conjunct markers per combination ranges from one to the maximum number of tested markers. 3.2. Detection of QTL interactions Here, µ, µ 0 , and µ 1 are the means of the phenotype values in S , S0 , and S1 , respectively. |X| is the number of individuals in X .  Here, Pi is the phenotype value of the i -th individual si . The F -measure is obtained by dividing the MSA by the MSW ( F = MSA/MSW) and indicates the bias of the distribution of phenotype values in the two subclasses. If the distribution of the phenotype in the two subclasses differs, one can conclude that the condition (i.e., the pattern of marker genotypes) used for sample division is associated with the phenotype of interest. In such cases, the F -measure value is large.  Significant locus combinations that have large F -measure values are searched in an incremental manner. During the searching procedure, the maximum F -measure obtained is Fopt , and the value of Fopt is updated when a better combination whose F -measure is higher than the current Fopt is identified. Additionally, d is a given margin value and the final result of this method includes all combinations whose F -measure is less than the maximum by this margin value d . To fulfill this condition, starting with a single marker, another marker is concatenated to the first marker with each round of the incremental search until the given maximum length L is reached. When each additional marker is concatenated to a combination, the F -measure is evaluated to judge whether the combination is significant or not (i.e., higher than Fopt - d or not). If the combination is significant, it is included in the result, and the upper boundary of the F -measure that the combination can reach by further concatenation is calculated. 21 If this upper boundary is less than Fopt - d , significant combinations cannot be obtained by further computation, and the current search is therefore terminated and evaluation of another set of combinations is started. When all searches are terminated, all the optimum and sub-optimum combinations are included in the result. 3.3. GMM search on a red clover data set We examined the feasibility of the GMM method using the datasets from red clover, which consist of 106 microsatellite markers distributed along the entire genome for the genotype dataset and the flowering date for the phenotype dataset. Using the GMM algorithm, we tentatively extracted the significant locus combinations consisting of at most L = 3 markers. Table  1 shows all the combinations of markers whose F -measure value was higher than 35.0 (searching was carried out setting the margin value d = 10.0 and only combinations higher than F = 35.0 are shown). All the combinations with high F -measure values listed in Table  1 are concatenations of three loci. This means that the F -measure values obtained using combinations of one or two loci were lower than those obtained using combinations of three loci. The combination of RCS2958(b-), RCS0914(b-), and RCS1300(ab) produced the highest F -measure score (43.9), and extracts samples with the three highest phenotype values (late-flowering samples). Fig.  4 illustrates the distribution of phenotype values extracted using each combination consisting of one, two, or three of the three loci. The F -measure values obtained using the single loci RCS2958(b-), RCS0914(b-) and RCS1300(ab) were 7.9 × 10 −1 , 3.9 × 10 0 , and 3.7 × 10 −4 , respectively. These low values indicate that there is almost no, or only a weak, effect of each single locus alone. Similar to the single locus results, combinations of two loci did not strongly affect the phenotype. However, the triple loci combinations are highly associated with the phenotype.  Distribution of phenotype values (flowering date) resulting from multiple locus/allele combinations. Combinations of two out of three locus/allele types are shown by green, blue, and yellow lines, and that of three types by red lines. Orange and gray bars indicate samples possessing the relevant locus/allele combinations and others, respectively (see Table  1 ).

Several loci are repeatedly listed in Table  1 , which indicates that they interact with multiple combinations of loci. For example, RCS1022(ab) and RCS1167(b-) were each found in five combinations in Table  1 . The redundancy of the list presentation does not facilitate an intuitive understanding of the results, and the obtained information was therefore also visualized in two styles of graphical presentation, as shown in Figs  5 and 6 . Fig.  5 illustrates the combinations of interacting triple loci and their positional information on the red clover linkage map. 17 Locations of interacting loci are interlinked by lines on the linkage group maps. By illustrating the positions of interacting loci, the loci which affect the phenotype through interactions with multiple combinations of genotypes are readily identified; in this case, 50–52 cM and 84–89 cM on LG2, 76 cM on LG5, and 27 cM on LG6. In a different type of graphic, Fig.  6 illustrates the relationships between interacting loci and allele type using GMs and a GMN. Line colors (GMNs) and cell colors (GMs) represent the magnitude of F -measure values for interacting and single locus/allele effects, respectively. By comparing several GMNs, the existence of ‘hub loci/alleles’ in these interactions emerges, such as RCS1022(ab) and RCS1167(b-), as well as multiple GMNs. The hub loci/alleles, however, did not show the highest effect on phenotypes when evaluated as a single locus/allele.

Discussion Although there is a growing awareness of the importance of gene interactions in genetic studies of complex traits, classical genetic analysis either ignores gene interactions or defines the effect of gene interactions as a deviation from genetic additive effects. 22 The demonstration in this study, using a real data set from red clover, indicates that the GMM algorithm efficiently detects multi-QTL interactions in genetic variation in a complex phenotype. The novel aspect of GMM is that the algorithm is capable of comparing multiple QTL interactions at once, which has not previously been possible in QTL detection approaches.  One of the advantages of comparison of multiple QTL interactions is the detection of hub locus/allele in the interactions. In this study, GMM demonstrated the existence of loci which affected the phenotype through multiple combinations of interacting loci. Interestingly, these hub loci/alleles did not necessarily display the highest effect on the phenotype as a single locus. To date, most findings have suggested that quantitative variation is determined by a few QTLs with a relatively large effect and a large number of genes having progressively smaller effects. 2 However, Jannink 23 recently identified QTLs by analyzing genetic background interactions in association studies, and was able to detect loci that have no main effect but which influence a trait only through their interactions with other loci. Our results, together with those of Jannink, suggest that multiple QTL interactions might be buried under the smaller effect of single QTLs. The hub locus/allele may be a key locus for identifying QTLs networks in which each component contributes directly to the final phenotype.  The hub loci/alleles that appeared in the multiple interactions that affected the flowering date of red clover were identified on 50–52 cM and 84–89 cM on LG2, 76 cM on LG5 and 27 cM on LG6. Herrmann et al. 24 have detected seven QTLs for the flowering date of red clover on all of the linkage groups except for on LG1. Although the tested DNA markers and the total lengths of the reference maps were different between Herrmann et al.'s (444 cM) and our study (869 cM), it could be presumed that the hub loci/alleles found on LG2 and LG5 will correspond to the QTLs identified by Herrmann et al., once a comparison of the two maps used in these studies has been performed. In this study, we used a set of unrelated individuals to demonstrate the GMM algorithm; however, any type of population, including family data, which is used for interval mapping analysis, can be analyzed by the GMM algorithm. Therefore, using GMM for reassessment of QTLs that have been identified by other methods (e.g., interval mapping) might provide us with insights into QTL interactions in the analyzed population. It is expected that the comparison of multiple combinations of interacting QTLs will lead to the identification of genes related to complex traits. Recently, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, which is a combination of gene expression profiling and classical genetic mapping, has been adopted to reveal quantitative heritable variation in the transcriptome. 25 In this method, however, thousands of expression profiles are related with sequence polymorphisms across the genome through their correlated variations, which results in a large number of mappings that make it difficult to consider simultaneously the relationships between multiple genomic regions and multiple expression profiles. 26 Prioritization and re-organization of a large number of original results by the GMM method may facilitate efficient dissection of expression QTLs and subsequent identification of genes.  Though the concept of GMM and its potential feasibility were demonstrated with a real genotype–phenotype data set in this article, there are several issues yet to be evaluated, examined, and solved before GMM can be applied more precisely for the detection of QTL interactions. The most prioritized issue to be discussed is the population structure. We used a data set of unrelated individuals without population structure in the present demonstration. However, QTL detection by GMM is performed on the basis of analysis of variance; thus, it is possible that hidden population structure leads to false positive associations between genotypes and phenotypes, as was observed in LD mapping. 27 Therefore, estimation of the degree of population structure of a data set prior to GMM calculation should be an essential requirement. In order to address the problem of population structure in population-based samples, Yu et al. 28 have developed a new statistical method for LD mapping that simultaneously accounts for both population structure and familial relatedness. A combination of such method with GMM might provide a solution to the problem of the current version of GMM.  Effectual data size and degree of significance are also indispensable issues to be evaluated. One of the most probable reasons for insufficient output from the GMM analysis is the limited size of the data set. Increasing the number of individuals for data acquisition would improve the accuracy of the whole analysis, but this is not always feasible, especially in the early stages of data preparation. On the other hand, there is a strong demand to sort locus combinations according to their significance so that the loci that are expected to interact together can be prioritized. Therefore, searching for probable locus combinations will be useful from a practical point of view. In LD mapping, for example, many simulation studies have been carried out to obtain the optimal experiment design to detect QTLs, by considering a wide range of parameters, such as population size, number of markers, heritability and effects of QTLs, length of LDs, and the number of generations. 29–32 As with LD mapping, it is probable that the appropriate size of a data set for GMM will vary depending on the experimental design. Moreover, if the number of alleles of each locus increases, the risk rate of detecting false-positive interactions could also increase. To solve such problems, we need to evaluate the detection power of GMM in relation to the number of possible combinations of individuals and their genotypes. Both simulation studies and the application of the GMM method to real data sets will be useful to estimate the effectual data size. Additionally, the robustness of the significance test should also be investigated in the near future.  For easy handling and presentation of the results for users, it will be fundamental to design an appropriate interface for the GMM software program. Because of the large number of, and sometimes redundant, candidate QTL combinations detected by the GMM analysis, extraction of meaningful information from a tabulated set of data will often be difficult. In this study, we presented two types of graphic presentations for the results from the GMM analysis: a circular linkage map (Fig.  5 ) and a combination GM and GMN chart (Fig.  6 ). Development of a user interface that allows intuitive understanding of the relationships among multiple QTL interactions is under way. Though GMM currently has several unclear issues which have to be resolved, it should give us an additional dimension of QTL impacts by indication of multiple QTL interactions. We hope the new ideas for dissection of QTL expression will be sparked on genetics and genomics by handling GMM.

IntroductionSmall RNAs play important roles in RNA silencing mechanisms which are involved in many biological processes in eukaryotes. These small RNAs guide post-transcriptional gene silencing by inhibiting translation or degrading the target mRNAs, and guide transcriptional gene silencing by modifying chromatin.1–3In Arabidopsis thaliana, functional small RNAs are mostly 21–24 nt long. The best-studied endogenous small RNAs are microRNAs (miRNAs). In Arabidopsis, miRNAs are excised from primary miRNA transcripts forming stem-loop structures by the RNase III enzyme DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1). This enzyme works coordinately with HYL1 and SERRATE to produce miRNA/miRNA* duplexes.4–9 miRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where the complementary mRNAs are cleaved by ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1), which has Slicer activity.10,11 Plants have some unique small RNAs in addition to miRNA. Trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA) is produced from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 with its binding partner, DRB4.12–14 miRNA and tasiRNA are mainly involved in plant development, response to environmental stresses and so on through regulating gene expression.1–3 siRNAs derived from natural-antisense transcripts (nat-siRNAs) exist in Arabidopsis and function in the stress response and bacterial disease resistance.15,16 However, the numbers and functions of nat-siRNAs are not fully understood.The RNA silencing pathway also serves as an anti-viral defense in plants. Viral genome-derived siRNAs are detected in plants infected with RNA viruses17,18 and DNA viruses.19,20 The lengths of these siRNAs differ with the type of viruses,18,21 suggesting the involvement of different DCLs in producing the respective viral siRNAs. It is conceived that the resulting siRNAs are loaded into the RISC as well as endogenous small RNAs, bind the viral genome through complementary sequences and direct the degradation of the viral genome. To counteract the silencing machinery of plants, many viruses have evolved genes which encode silencing suppressor proteins with distinct properties.22,23 Many suppressors have dsRNA binding activity so that virus siRNAs are trapped, resulting in inhibition of the silencing machinery.24,25 In contrast to the dsRNA binding strategy, the Cucumber mosaic virus-encoded 2b protein directly interacts with AGO1 and inhibits its activity26 and Turnip crinkle virus-encoded P38 protein suppresses DCL4 activity.18We have examined the crucifer Tobacco mosaic virus-Cg (TMV-Cg) infection of Arabidopsis as a model system to study plant-Tobamovirus interaction.27,28 TMV-Cg is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. We have previously cloned and sequenced small RNAs from Arabidopsis infected or uninfected with TMV-Cg and demonstrated that miRNAs increased in the virus-infected plants.28 In TMV and Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), which both belong to the Tobamovirus family, 126K replication proteins suppress RNA silencing.29,30 Thus, it is postulated that the 126K replication protein of TMV-Cg also acts as a silencing suppressor because it binds to small dsRNAs.28 Owing to this activity, 126K replication protein binds to miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, resulting in the accumulation of miRNAs. In the present study, we examined all small RNA sequences obtained from Arabidopsis infected or uninfected with TMV-Cg. We then mapped the region where each small RNA sequence was derived in the Arabidopsis genome. Among the small RNAs from virus-infected plants, we identified several newly identified miRNAs and miRNA candidates. Virus-infected plants could be an effective source to find novel miRNAs.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mapping of small RNAs using BLAST searchesWe have analyzed small RNA sequences obtained previously; 1700 and 543 reads from the leaves of Arabidopsis infected and uninfected with TMV-Cg at 3 days post-infection (dpi), respectively.28 Each sequence of non-viral genome origin was mapped to the Arabidopsis genome by NCBI BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and TAIR BLAST (http://www.arabidopsis.org/Blast/index.jsp) searches. During searches, we allowed one mismatch at its 3′ end, because 3′ ends of small RNAs in virus-infected plants are possibly unmethylated and unstable.31 All BLAST searches were performed automatically using BioPython script programs.2.2. Other computational analysesSecondary structures of miRNA precursors were predicted using the mFOLD program (http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/).32 Targets of miRNAs were predicted using the miRU: Plant microRNA Potential Target Finder (http://bioinfo3.noble.org/miRNA/miRU.htm).33To compare the ratio of our sequences to that of other databases, each sequence was searched against the Arabidopsis MPSS Plus Database (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/)34 and the Arabidopsis Small RNA Project (ASRP) (http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/).35 In Table 2, miRNAs were searched against 4Co10 (Co1-0 wildtype inflorescence tissues, small RNA 454) in MPSS and Co1-0 (Leaf, Inflorescence) in ASRP. In Fig. 2, small RNA sequences were searched against all datasets in both databases.2.3. Plant materials and virus inoculationThe following Arabidopsis plants were used; Col-0 (wild type), dcl1-9 (BC6), dcl2-2 (SALK_123586), dcl3-1 (SALK_005512) and dcl4-1 (BC6). Dr Herve Vaucheret (INRA, France) kindly provided dcl1-9 (BC6) and dcl4-1 (BC6), which were backcrossed to Col-0 six times. All plants were grown in a growth chamber at 22°C with photoperiod of 16 h. For the virus inoculation, leaves of 4-week-old plants were dusted with carborundum and gently rubbed with 20 µg/mL of TMV-Cg solution. For mock inoculation, TMV-Cg solution was replaced with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer.2.4. Northern blot analysisTotal RNA was extracted at 10 dpi from the inoculated leaves, mock-inoculated leaves and inflorescences of Arabidopsis using ISOGEN reagent (Nippon gene). Aliquots of 10 µg of total RNA were loaded and resolved on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel (7 M urea). To make the miR847(5′) probe, oligonucleotide (TCGGCTTCCCATTCCTCTTCA) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (TOYOBO). Hybridization was carried out at 40°C using PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma). The blots were exposed on imaging plates, and signals were visualized using BAS-2500 (Fuji).3. Results and discussion3.1. Increase of miRNAs in Arabidopsis infected with TMV-CgWe have previously sequenced small RNAs from the leaves of Arabidopsis infected or uninfected with TMV-Cg at 3 dpi. We obtained 1700 sequences from the virus-infected plants and 543 sequences from mock-infected plants.28 We reported that total miRNAs were more abundant in virus-infected plants than in mock-infected plants, as shown in the northern blot results of some miRNAs. To further compare the small RNA expression profiles between virus-infected plants and mock-infected plants, we performed extensive BLAST searches to map all small RNA sequences to the Arabidopsis genome (Table 1), except for siRNAs derived from the viral genome which were 210 reads (12.4 % of total reads), as previously reported.28Summary of non-viral small RNA sequences from TMV-infected or uninfected ArabidopsisaViral genome-derived siRNA are not included.Summary of non-viral small RNA sequences from TMV-infected or uninfected ArabidopsisaViral genome-derived siRNA are not included.The percentage of total miRNAs was 5.5 times higher in TMV-infected plants (25.4%) than that in mock-infected plants (4.6%) (Table 1 and Kurihara et al.28). In contrast to the large increase of miRNAs in TMV-Cg-infected plants, the percentage of tasiRNAs was almost unchanged (2.0% in mock-infected plants and 1.6% in virus-infected plants) (Table 1). tasiRNA is another class of small RNAs in plants which is produced by the RNase III enzyme DCL4 protein.36 This suggests that miRNAs, among other characterized small RNA classes, specifically increased by the TMV infection.We have recently demonstrated that the increase of miRNAs could be attributed to the activity of the viral-encoded 126K protein, which binds and therefore stabilizes miRNA/miRNA* duplexes.28 However, we found that there is no big difference between the ratios of miRNA to miRNA* in mock- and TMV-infected plants (6.6 times in mock-infected plants and 10 times in TMV-infected plants). This fact possibly indicates that there is still another mechanism of the miRNA increase or stabilization in the virus-infected plants, in addition to binding activity of 126K protein to miRNA/miRNA* duplexes.We compared the percentage of each miRNA between mock-infected and virus-infected plants (Fig. 1). The percentages of all miRNAs except for miR160 increased as a result of virus infection. Some miRNAs showed remarkable increases, especially in miR163 (from 1.1 to 9.3%), miR164 (from 0.2 to 5.1%) and miR167 (from 0.4 to 2.7%). Most others increased 2–3 times in virus-infected plants. This result indicates that binding activity of the TMV-Cg replication protein to those miRNA/miRNA* duplexes is specifically high, or that transcription of some miRNAs is also activated.Most miRNAs increased in TMV-Cg-infected plants. Percentages of each miRNA cloned in non-viral small RNAs are shown. All miRNAs except for miR160 increased in the virus-infected plants. Circle indicates miRNA that was detected only in the small RNA dataset from the virus-infected plants.Most miRNAs increased in TMV-Cg-infected plants. Percentages of each miRNA cloned in non-viral small RNAs are shown. All miRNAs except for miR160 increased in the virus-infected plants. Circle indicates miRNA that was detected only in the small RNA dataset from the virus-infected plants.Inhibition of the miRNA pathway has been reported with many other virus-infected plants and with plants transformed with viral proteins.26,37–39 Initially we expected that miRNA up-regulation should lead the down-regulation of the target mRNAs and that might work as a defense response to virus infection. However, in the TMV-Cg-infected plants, the target mRNAs of miRNAs were not down-regulated, even though miRNAs increased (Supplementary Fig. S1). The increase of miRNA does not induce target mRNA degradation and the miRNA pathway is completely disrupted in plants infected with TMV-Cg, as is the case during infection with other plant viruses. This supports the notion that the replication protein of TMV-Cg acts as a silencing suppressor.3.2. Unique small RNAs in gene and intergenic regions in TMV-infected and mock-infected plantsIn addition to the increase of miRNA percentage in plants infected with TMV-Cg, some miRNAs were cloned and sequenced only in the virus-infected plants (Fig. 1; indicated with circles). This led us to speculate that the virus-infected plants could be a good source for finding new miRNAs.If there are new miRNAs in our small RNA sequence reads, they are likely to be mapped in the gene or intergenic region (Table 1). Therefore, we checked whether there are new sequences in the small RNAs mapped to the gene and intergenic regions compared with other small RNA databases; ASRP35 and MPSS34 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, not only in TMV-Cg-infected plants but also in mock-infected plants, most small RNAs were not detected in ASRP and MPSS databases and were unique to our reads, although there are 34 times more sequences in MPSS and 260 times more in ASRP than in our dataset from virus-infected plants. This is possibly due to the differences in RNA sources and cloning methods between ours and other groups' which performed deep sequencing using the 454 sequencing method. This suggests that many small RNAs remain to be discovered. They will be found if the cloning condition is changed even though the total reads are less than those using 454 sequencing. Thus, it is quite possible that there are new functional small RNAs in our resources of virus-infected and mock-infected plants. Especially in the TMV-infected plants in which many kinds of miRNAs were more abundant, we can expect new miRNA reads.Most sequences in this study are not found in other databases. Each small RNA sequence was searched against the ASRP and MPSS databases. Numbers of different sequences in gene and intergenic regions are shown, which are also found in ASRP and/or MPSS database, or not found in both. In both mock-infected and TMV-Cg-infected plants, most sequences are unique in this study.Most sequences in this study are not found in other databases.

In both mock-infected and TMV-Cg-infected plants, most sequences are unique in this study.3.3. miRNA candidates in plants infected with TMV-CgThree miRNAs (miR822, miR823, and miR824) reported very recently40 were found in our reads of virus-infected plants and, moreover, their appearances were more frequent in our total small RNAs from virus-infected plants than those in MPSS and ASRP databases (Table 2). This supports that virus-infected plants are good source for identifying novel miRNAs.Newly identified miRNAs and miRNA candidate are more abundant in TMV-Cg-infected Arabidopsis than in other databasesNewly identified miRNAs and miRNA candidate are more abundant in TMV-Cg-infected Arabidopsis than in other databasesNext, we tried to find out novel miRNAs in the small RNA data of the virus-infected plants. Before confirmation and validation of new miRNAs, we performed secondary structure predictions using the mFOLD program. We used sequences ∼300 nt in length from around the matched stretch where small RNAs mapped to the gene and intergenic regions. Three different sequences formed hairpin structures, which are common structures to miRNA precursors (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that these sequences are candidates of miRNAs.Predicted secondary structure of new miRNA candidate's precursor. Secondary structure of new miRNA candidate found in this study was predicted using the mFOLD program. miR847(5′) is derived from the 5′ arm of miR847 but they are not in miRNA/miRNA* relationship.Predicted secondary structure of new miRNA candidate's precursor. Secondary structure of new miRNA candidate found in this study was predicted using the mFOLD program. miR847(5′) is derived from the 5′ arm of miR847 but they are not in miRNA/miRNA* relationship.Out of them, we found that one candidate could be mapped to the 5′ arm of miR847 (Fig. 3). Though it may be a variant of miR847*, it is possible that the small RNA is also functional because it has an 8 nt overhang instead of 2 nt, which the DCL product generally has (Fig. 3). Thus, we named it miR847(5′) and analyzed further. In our small RNA data, there was no miR847 sequence while miR847(5′) was read twice. miR847(5′) was not cloned in ASRP and MPSS databases (Table 2). The other two sequences forming hairpin structures were named candidates A and B (Supplementary Fig. S2). Each of them was read once in the small RNA data from virus-infected plants.We performed northern blot analyses to detect these miRNA candidates and confirm their expression patterns. Out of three miRNA candidates, only miR847(5′) could be detected (Fig. 4). Candidates A and B were not detected.Northern blot analysis of miR847(5′). Total RNA (10 µg) from rosette leaves (mock-infected and infected with TMV-Cg) and inflorescences were used for northern blot analyses. miR847(5′) increased during TMV-Cg infection but was not detected in the dcl1mutant, indicating that miR847(5′) is miRNA. miR847(5′) was not detected in inflorescences.Northern blot analysis of miR847(5′). Total RNA (10 µg) from rosette leaves (mock-infected and infected with TMV-Cg) and inflorescences were used for northern blot analyses. miR847(5′) increased during TMV-Cg infection but was not detected in the dcl1mutant, indicating that miR847(5′) is miRNA. miR847(5′) was not detected in inflorescences.miR847(5′) was not expressed in flowers but in rosette leaves. It was more abundant in TMV-Cg-infected plants than in mock-infected plants (Fig. 4). This result reflected the tendency observed in the cloning frequency discussed earlier and northern blot results of other miRNAs reported previously.28 Furthermore, miR847(5′) was expressed at a similar level in mutants except in the dcl1 mutant. In Arabidopsis, most miRNAs are produced by DCL1 in general, whereas, for example, tasiRNAs require both DCL1 and DCL4 for their productions. Therefore, if the expression of a small RNA is reduced only in dcl1 mutant plants, the small RNA is possibly a miRNA. Therefore, the northern blot result supports that miR847(5′) is an miRNA. In contrast, miR847 could not be detected by northern blot analysis neither in leaves nor in inflorescences (data not shown).The predicted targets of these three miRNA candidates and miR847 are shown in Supplementary Table S1. However, we have not yet detected their possible cleaved fragment by the 5′ RACE method.38 On the basis of the available data, we could not conclude which of small RNAs is a functional miRNA; miR847 and miR847(5′) at present. Further analyses will be needed to make conclusion.Recently, many results of comprehensive small RNA sequencing by 454 sequencing have been reported one after another in Arabidopsis.40–43 It has been demonstrated that miRNAs are enriched in loss-of-function mutants of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) and RNA polymerase IV because they are required for the majority of endogenous siRNAs.41,43 By analyzing these mutant plants with the 454 sequencing method, dozens of miRNAs were discovered. In this study, we showed that plants infected with TMV-Cg are good materials for cloning and finding novel miRNAs frequently because cloning percentages of many miRNAs increase and newly identified miRNAs are found in virus-infected plants. Moreover, considering that the number of small RNA sequences read were tens to hundreds less than those of other groups, TMV-infected plants are very efficient materials to discover new miRNAs. It is anticipated that new miRNAs would be found from small RNAs in the virus-infected leaves if extensive reads were performed.Most Arabidopsis miRNAs, expressed abundantly and conserved, have already been identified. However, there are many kinds of miRNAs which are less-expressed and non-conserved42 and it is possible that some are yet to be discovered. These miRNAs will be hereafter identified using plants under various conditions or mutant plants, which will leads to the identification of overall miRNAs and siRNAs and the understanding of how small RNAs are involved in many biological processes in Arabidopsis.FundingSasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society to Y.T.We thank Dr Herve Vaucheret (INRA, France) for providing the dcl1-9 (BC6) and dcl4-1 (BC6) mutants.Supplementary data"

Discovery of genes in legume plants is progressing rapidly and is yielding improved quantity and quality for industrial as well as agricultural uses (see http://intl.plantphysiol.org/cgi/collection/legume_biology ).  Soybean is undoubtedly the most important legume crop in the world. It is important in Japan for the production of traditional foods such as tofu, miso, shoyu and vegetable oil. Therefore, its agronomical characteristics have been analyzed at the molecular level to speed-up its breeding for various uses. In the past decade, plant genome analyses using model organisms have provided a large amount of genomic information and various categories of knowledge for gene functions: genome sequence, collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and DNA markers are widely exploited for the discovery of genes. Soybean has a large genome of 1,115 Mbp with 2n = 40 that contains complex regional duplications. Several types of genome projects including linkage map production have been initiated to uncover its complex genomic structure and to help gene discovery. As for the EST collection, soybean has the sixth largest collection of more than 390,000 sequences ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/dbEST ). Transcriptional maps with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have been published using EST information. Recently, whole genome sequencing of soybean has started in the USA, using a shotgun sequencing strategy ( http://soybeangenome.siu.edu,http://www.agbionetwork.org/∼soybeangenome/GSA.php ).  For the genetic and genomic analyses of the soybean genome, precise genetic and physical maps are important. Indeed, various types of physical maps have so far been reported using RFLP, RAPD, SSR and AFLP markers. Two important papers in this issue by Hisano et al. (doi:10.1093/dnares/dsm025) and by Xia et al. (doi:10.1093/dnares/dsm027) report on the collection of large numbers of soybean DNA markers and their precise map using a hybrid between the Japanese cultivar ‘Misuzudaizu’ and the Chinese line ‘Moshidou Gong 503’. Hisano et al. used microsatellite markers obtained from the public EST databases to generate a high-density linkage map of the soybean genome. They mapped 935 marker loci in 20 linkage groups. The method is efficient to produce a large number of DNA markers based on EST database. They found macrosynteny in various segments between soybean and L. japonicus . Their comparative analysis revealed the occurrence of significant genome shuffling during evolution after the separation of two species. Xia et al. reported an updated linkage map using AFLP, SSR, RFLP and STS markers and integrated the map with the previous one reported by the author's group. The updated map is expected to be useful for efficient positional cloning of agronomically important QTL genes. Sequencing of the soybean genome and the model legume species will provide us with a large amount of information for useful genes. Recently, a soybean genome sequence project was also started in Japan using a Japanese cultivar ‘Enrei’. More than 10,000 independent full-length cDNAs have been collected from various organs and stress-treated soybean.

Introduction Bacteria have evolved elaborate mechanisms for adhering to and colonizing solid surfaces, thereby establishing microbial communities known as biofilms. 1 These represent a distinct lifestyle for bacteria that provides protection from deleterious conditions, thereby raising various problems to our life such as causing persistent and chronic human infections 2 or contamination of food products.  The transition from a planktonic to a sedentary biofilm mode of life requires the coordinated regulation of genes involved in the development of biofilms, which is an interesting theme to investigate the intricate network of signal transduction for gene expression in bacterial cells. 3 The latter lifestyle would require the expression of genes that have not been investigated in studies with planktonic cells. Recent analyses of biofilms using DNA microarray 4–6 revealed that hundreds of genes including many of uncharacterized are differentially expressed in biofilms, which would provide insights into the genetic basis for biofilm formation. However, the agreement for differential gene expression is limited among these studies, probably reflecting differences in experimental conditions as well as the nature of biofilm itself. 7 The environment within the biofilm is heterogeneous and biofilm formation is a dynamic process. 8 Furthermore, the different expression of some genes may be due to differences in growth of planktonic cells used as control. 9 Genetic analysis revealed that surface structures such as flagella and specific outer-membrane adhesins, Type 1, and curli fimbriae of Escherichia coli are important for biofilm formation, though they are not indispensable. 10 , 11 The extent of biofilm formation and the effect of mutation seem to be variable depending on the strains used. 12–14 Keeping the above problems in mind, we started identifying genes that cause upon disruption a reduced biofilmformation in the same genetic background. In this study, we used a collection of single-gene deletion mutants of all non-essential genes of E. coli called ‘Keio collection’ 15 and performed a quantitative analysis of their biofilm formation. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmidEscherichia coli K-12 strain BW25113 and isogenic deletion mutants of the Keio collection 15 were used. KR0401 is a derivative of BW25113 spontaneously obtained (see text). Kanamycin sensitive derivatives of deletion mutants were constructed using plasmid pCP20 as described. 16 Plasmids p yfgA is one clone of ASKA library, a set of plasmid clones containing all predicted ORFs of E. coli . 172.2. Assay for biofilm formation2.3. Phenotype assays Motility was observed essentially as described by Wolfe and Berg. 19 Three microlitres of overnight cultures were spotted on semi-solid agar plates (1% Tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.3% Difco agar) and incubated at 30°C for 6 h. The diameter of swarming colony was measured and clones that showed more than 50% of the wild-type control as well as those that were less than 50% but apparently motile were scored as positive and intermediate phenotype, respectively. Mannose-binding Type 1 fimbriae production was examined by the ability of cells to agglutinate budding yeast cells. 20 Equal volumes of bacterial and yeast cultures were mixed in a titer plate and observed for agglutination either with the naked eyes or under the microscope. Clones that showed no visible aggregation were evaluated as Type 1 fimbriae deficient. Curli fimbriae production of colonies was judged on CFA plates containing 0.1 mg/mL of Congo Red dye. 21 Colonies were observed for uptake of the red colour after 3 days incubation at 25°C. Clones that were stained as much as wild-type control cells were scored as curli positive and those that remained uncoloured as deletion mutants of csgA were considered negative. Cells that showed in between colour level were evaluated as intermediate. 2.4. Preparation and analysis of OMPs Strains were grown in 10 mL LB medium containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin to an OD 600 of 0.8–1.0 and the OD 600 of each culture recorded at the time of harvest. OMPs were prepared following the procedure described by Onufryk et al. 22 . Finally, the sample was suspended in 40 µL SDS buffer and a portion corresponding to 2.0 OD 600 of cells was analyzed by loading on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. 2.5. Synthetic phenotype analysis of double deletion mutants To examine the effect of introducing a second deletion mutation, the kanamycin resistance gene was first eliminated from deletion mutants through FLP recombination mediated by pCP20. 16 The resultant Km S deletion mutants were used as recipients and another deletion mutation harbouring the antibiotic resistant cassette was introduced by P1 transduction. Appearance of Km R transductants was monitored after overnight incubation at 37°C. 3. Results and discussion3.1. Screening of genes involved in biofilm formation To investigate the effect of deletion of individual genes on biofilm formation, mutants were grown in LB medium and the amount of cells attached to 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates was measured. The results obtained revealed that the growth of deletion mutants was quite variable (Fig.  1 ), which might affect the amount of attached cells. For this reason, we normalized the value of biofilm formation against the cell growth and termed it as ‘relative biofilm’ as described in experimental procedures. Throughout these analyses, we used strain KR0401, a derivative of BW25113 (parental strain of Keio collection), as a control and the relative biofilm formed by each mutant was expressed as a ratio to that of KR0401 to minimize the experimental fluctuation. KR0401 that was obtained spontaneously from BW25113 showed a stable and higher level of biofilm formation compared with BW25113 itself (data not shown). Although it is unclear why the biofilm formation of BW25113 varies from one batch to another, this feature might explain the difference in the biofilm formation observed between two deletion strains of the same gene within the Keio collection.  Correlation between the growth and the amount of attached cells of deletion mutants of the Keio collection. Gray squares represent the selected deletion clones listed in Table  1 shown with the total mutants examined (black squares), parental strain BW25113 (white circle), and KR0401 used as a control (white triangle). The amounts of attached cells (cv) relative to that of the control are plotted against growth.

Gray squares represent the selected deletion clones listed in Table  1 shown with the total mutants examined (black squares), parental strain BW25113 (white circle), and KR0401 used as a control (white triangle). The amounts of attached cells (cv) relative to that of the control are plotted against growth.  We analyzed the biofilm formation of each mutant at least twice and selected ∼160 genes that showed, on average, less than 36% biofilm formation of KR0401 as candidates of biofilm-related gene. However, the Keio collection contains two independent sets of deletion mutants and the results for some genes were inconsistent between them. Therefore, we also selected those clones if one of the two showed less than 30% of the biofilm formation of KR0401, which is why the values of some selected clones in Fig.  1 are rather high. Next, we tried to confirm that the deletion mutations of selected genes are indeed responsible for the reduced biofilm formation by transforming with the plasmid clone of ASKA library 17 containing each corresponding wild-type gene. However, a considerable number of deletion mutants were only partially complemented by them or not at all (data not shown), which is probably because the overproduction or uncoordinated expression from the plasmid clone is also deleterious to biofilm formation. 23 Therefore, we transferred the deletion mutation of selected genes into KR0401 strain by P1 transduction, selecting for Kanamycin resistance to examine the relation between biofilm phenotype and the deleted gene.  Biofilm formation of four independent transductants was analyzed for each mutant and the average and standard deviation of their relative biofilm formation was calculated. Transductants of some deletion mutants did not show apparent reduction in biofilm formation. Some others grew very poorly such that the reduced biofilm formation they exhibited was considered to be the result of bad growth. The genes of these deletion mutants were therefore excluded from the list of biofilm-related genes. In a few cases, one of the two deletion mutants of the Keio collection was found to be incorrect by PCR analysis of their chromosome, which probably occurred due to the contamination of other mutants during the transfer of clones, and only the data for correct clones were incorporated in Table  1 .

Several deletion mutations were non-transferable by P1 phage, because strains harbouring them were refractory to P1 propagation. Therefore, we initially introduced the corresponding archive clone (ASKA library) 17 by transformation and then propagated P1 from the resulting transformants. These genes were lpcA, rfaD , and rfaE , which are involved in LPS biosynthesis. The P1 lysates thus obtained were subsequently transduced into KR0401 and the biofilm forming ability examined. However, in the case of rfaC , tolQ , and yiiS gene mutants, transformants of the corresponding archive clones still could not propagate P1 and thus we failed to confirm the effect of the deletion mutations in biofilm formation. Therefore, these genes were not included in the final list of biofilm-related genes.  As a consequence, 110 genes were identified to be associated with biofilm formation upon disruption, although there were variations in the degree of reduction observed in each gene deletion mutant (Table  1 ). They are classified according to their functions and their possible roles in biofilm formation are discussed in the following sections. 3.2. Motility and fimbriae genes Various investigations reported so far showed that bacterial cell surface structures are important for cell adhesion during the development of biofilm. In E. coli K12 strains, flagella, Type 1, and curli fimbriae are the main structures implicated in biofilm formation. 24 Therefore, we subsequently examined deletion mutants of these three surface appendages as listed in Table  1 .  As expected, most mutants of flagella biosynthesis and motility genes including cyaA and crp that are required for the expression of flagella genes 25 showed severe biofilm defects and loss of motility, whereas flhE , fliL , and fliT mutants retained the motility as reported previously 26–28 and showed a lesser extent of reduction in biofilm formation. This was also the case with an flgN mutant. Proteins encoded by flgN and fliT act as chaperones in flagella assembly but they are not structural proteins. 28 The functions of flhE and fliL are still not clear, although they reside in the flagella operon. 26 , 27 , 29 These results indicate that the biofilm formation can reflect even a subtle functional or structural difference in flagella. This possibility was also indicated in the results for mutants of disulfide interchange proteins. A severe biofilm defect (8.5% of wild type) was observed with a dsbA mutant, whereas dsbB disruption caused only a mild reduction (50%). DsbA protein catalyzes the disulfide bond formation, whereas the role of DsbB is to supply the material and its requirement can be suppressed in a medium supplied with cysteine. 30 Dsb proteins are implicated in flagella assembly and mutants are non-motile in the absence of cystine. 31 Flagella are probably important for the initial cell-to-surface contact and the spread of bacteria along the surface. 10 Previously we reported that the overproduction of several genes for flagella biosynthesis also showed reduced biofilm formation. 23 This reduced biofilm phenotype might have resulted from the uncoordinated gene expression that has led to the deficiency of flagella and reduced motility.  Apart from flagella-related genes, mutants of lpcA, rfaD , and rfaE that are required for LPS biosynthesis were found to be non-motile and highly impaired in biofilm formation. On the other hand, cheZ , dnaK , and yfgA mutants are non-motile and yet showed only moderate biofilm phenotypes. These observations indicate that the structure of flagella and membrane that supports the assembly of flagella might be more important than the motility itself for biofilm formation.  The fim gene cluster encodes proteins involved in the biosynthesis of Type 1 fimbriae. Mutants of all fim genes except fimE , fimG , and fimI were negative in agglutination assay and exhibited severe defects in biofilm formation. The fimG mutants showed less severe biofilm compared with the other fim genes, which might reflect the function of the fimG product that may act as an inhibitor of pilus polymerization. 32 FimE negatively regulates the fimbriae synthesis 33 and the function of FimI is not clear. 34 Mutants of these genes showed increased and normal biofilm formation, respectively (data not shown). Apart from fim genes, ihfB and surA mutants were defective in agglutination assay and exhibited severe biofilm-defective phenotype. Type 1 fimbriae-deficient strains showed most severe biofilm reduction among mutants investigated, which may reflect their importance in the irreversible attachment of cells to the surface.  Six genes in two operons csgBA and csgDEFG function in the curli formation in E. coli (reviewed by Barnhart and Chapman 35 ). Deletion mutants of all these genes showed reduction in biofilm formation. The effect of loss of CsgA and CsgB, a structural subunit and a nucleator protein, respectively, was greater than those of the accessory proteins CsgD, CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG that are required for curli assembly. In addition to curli genes, cya, ihfB, lon, mlrA, nlpD, ompR, rpoS , and yieO genes showed impaired curli production upon disruption. Curli synthesis is under the complex regulatory network, which includes ihf , mlrA , ompR , rpoS genes, and the Rcs system. The Rcs system negatively regulates curli synthesis and is activated by mutations affecting the cell envelope (reviewed by Barnhart and Chapman 35 ) and metabolic stress via the alteration of membrane-related oligosaccharides. 36 The effect on biofilm formation of the deletion mutation in these genes was moderate except for cyaA and ihfB genes, mutants of which are also defective in motility and Type 1 fimbriae, respectively, as shown above. Curli-deficient mutants exhibited moderate biofilm reduction compared with the former two surface structures, although curli were reported to be important for the initial adhesion and subsequent biofilm development. 10 We observed that curli mutants initially adhered to the surface to a certain extent but probably detached after a while (data not shown), which suggests that curli contribute more to the maturation of the biofilm formed rather than the initial cell attachment. The results mentioned above not only confirmed the importance of these cell surface structures but also indicated that the function of a specific deletion was well reflected in the biofilm formation. On the other hand, the existence of many more mutants that seem to be intact in these surface structures but exhibit reduced biofilm phenotype showed that indeed various genes are required for the proper development of biofilm.3.3. Lipopolysaccharide genes Genome-wide analysis of deletion mutants revealed that eight genes involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis exhibited a significant degree of reduction in biofilm formation when disrupted. All of them except rfaH encode enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of l -glycero- d -manno-heptose and inner core assembly of the LPS indicating that the heptose region of the core oligosaccharide is important not only for the outer membrane stability 37 but also for the adhesion of cell whereas the outer core and O-antigen are not critical for biofilm formation. Their defective biofilm formation seems not simply due to the lack of the major surface structures mentioned above, at least in the case of rfaF , rfaG , rfaH , and rfaP mutants, because they were normal in motility and agglutination assay. LPS seems to be important for the initial attachment to the surface, since mutants of LPS synthesis genes showed biofilm reduction similar to flagella-defective mutants. Some of them also exhibited motility-defective phenotype as described earlier. The gene rfaH encodes a transcriptional antiterminator required for the expression of the rfa operon 38 and, in contrast to our result, its inactivation was reported to increase the initial adhesion and biofilm formation. 39 The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but it might be due to the difference in culture conditions. 3.4. Others Apart from LPS, many genes related to cell membrane were identified to exhibit mild reduction in biofilm formation upon disruption. However, our analysis could not identify the genes for colanic acid synthesis. This exopolysaccharide is not required for the initial attachment but important for the biofilm development into a complex three-dimensional structure (reviewed by Van Houdt and Michiels 24 ). Therefore, the possible reason for this failure is that our procedure was not suitable for the analysis of the late stage of biofilm formation or that the parental strain of the Keio collection does not develop such a structure as reported for some laboratory E. coli strains. In addition, genes of more variable functions, including nine genes of unknown function, were identified in our analysis. Although the precise mechanism how the deletion of these genes leads to defective biofilm formation remains to be clarified, it is conceivable that the perturbation of cellular activity such as metabolism and energy production causes some deficiency or stress in the cell membrane, thereby affecting biofilm formation.3.5. Characterization of function-unknown genes Some of the function-unknown genes identified are predicted to encode membrane proteins based on their primary structure and/or the phenotypes of their mutants (Table  1 ). Moreover, it is well expected that membrane proteins, in particular OMPs, contribute to the developmental processes of biofilm formation. Therefore, we examined the profiles of major OMPs isolated from mutants of function-unknown genes and surA . SurA possesses both periplasmic chaperone and peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activities and facilitates OMP biogenesis. 40 Its mutant shows a profile of significantly reduced OMPs 41 and highly impaired biofilm formation (Table  1 ). The amounts of OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, and LamB were found to be reduced in yciB , yciM , and yfgA mutants, although the effect was not so drastic as that observed with the surA mutant (Fig.  2 ). This result indicates that these genes might be required for membrane integrity. However, our analysis did not identify mutants of major OMP genes: the reason could be that deficiency of a single OMP gene might not cause an observable reduction in biofilm formation.  The OMP profiles of deletion mutants of uncharacterized genes. Outer membrane fractions prepared from the equivalent amount of cells of KR0401 (lane 1) and its derivative strains harboring Δ yfgA ::Km, Δ yciM ::Km, Δ yciB ::Km, and Δ surA ::Km mutations (lanes 2–5, respectively) were analyzed on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.  The OMP profiles of deletion mutants of uncharacterized genes. Outer membrane fractions prepared from the equivalent amount of cells of KR0401 (lane 1) and its derivative strains harboring Δ yfgA ::Km, Δ yciM ::Km, Δ yciB ::Km, and Δ surA ::Km mutations (lanes 2–5, respectively) were analyzed on a 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.  The genetic interaction of function-unknown genes with the surA gene was then investigated by analyzing the synthetic phenotype of double mutations as described in the experimental procedures. By observing the phenotype of the double mutants thus constructed, Δ yfgA was found to exhibit a synthetic lethal phenotype with Δ surA . Similarly, Δ yciB , Δ yciM , and Δ yhcB were synthetically lethal with Δ yfgA and the phenotype was rescued by introducing a plasmid carrying the wild-type allele of yfgA (Table  2 ). Mutants of yciM and yfgA were also more sensitive to SDS and Novobiocin, an amphipathic antibiotic, compared with the wild-type strain (data not shown). Synthetic phenotypes displayed by function-unknown genes+ indicates much the same phenotype as that of the corresponding single mutant, whereas – indicates that no transductant appeared, and vs very small colonies, respectively. NT, not tested.Synthetic phenotypes displayed by function-unknown genes+ indicates much the same phenotype as that of the corresponding single mutant, whereas – indicates that no transductant appeared, and vs very small colonies, respectively. NT, not tested.3.6. Concluding remarksOur genome-wide analysis demonstrated that variable genes are indeed required for biofilm formation and that the cell surface structures and envelope are important factors. It could be that cells are required to re-organize their membrane structures during the process of developing biofilms and it is in such a process that the hitherto uncharacterized genes described above might be involved. The analysis described here by using deletion mutants could directly identify genes involved in biofilm formation. However, certain genes not identified in this analysis might probably be required under different conditions and/or in different genetic backgrounds. Also, we found genes that increased biofilm formation upon disruption (Fig.  1 ). They include various genes such as those for signal transduction, transcription, carbohydrate metabolism as well as those of unknown function. Further analysis of these genes would provide clues with respect to how bacteria change their life-style. FundingE. T. E.

IntroductionThe planktonic, gas-vacuolated cyanobacteria, including Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Microcystis, Nodularia, and Planktothrix, cause water blooms in eutrophic lakes, ponds, and reservoirs all over the world. They also produce a diverse range of toxins, including neurotoxins [e.g. anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a(s), and saxitoxins] and hepatotoxins (e.g. microcystins, nodularins, and cylindropsermopsins), which cause a variety of human illnesses, and are responsible for deaths in native and domestic animals.1 Among these, the unicellular, colonial cyanobacterium Microcystis is the most representative genus of toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria. It produces a cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxin, termed microcystin1 and a depsipeptide, chymotrypsin-inhibitor called cyanopeptolin,2 and is widely distributed geographically, from cold-temperate climates to the tropics.Microcystis is characterized as a cyanobacterium with gas vesicles, a coccoid cell shape, a tendency to form aggregates or colonies, and an amorphous mucilage or sheath.3 Generally, five morphospecies of Microcystis, M. aeruginosa, M. ichthyoblabe, M. novacekii, M. viridis, and M. wesenbergii, are recognized as the dominant species of water bloom-forming Microcystis.4,5 These species were defined solely based on morphological characteristics, such as cell size, colony formation, and sheath characteristics. However, the morphology of Microcystis is highly variable, and the variation sometimes exceeds species criteria.6 It has been suggested that the species definition of Microcystis is invalid for the following reasons: the low sequence divergence of 16S rDNA within and between morphospecies (<0.7%), the lack of correspondence between the morphospecies and the nucleotide sequences of the 16S–23S rDNA, and inability to differentiate fatty acid composition, GC content, temperature-salinity tolerance, and chemo- and photoheterotrophy among morphospecies.7–9 In light of these considerations, and a high DNA–DNA re-association value of over 70%, which is high enough to integrate Microcystis into a single bacterial species,10 Otsuka et al.11 unified the five morphospecies into a single species under the Rules of the Bacteriological Code, and NIES-843T was proposed as the type strain of Microcystis.To date, the entire genome of 29 cyanobacteria with various characteristics have been sequenced (NCBI website, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/static/eub_g.html, and CyanoBase, http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/). However, the genomic structures of the toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria have not been reported, despite the level of social awareness of this species. In the present study, we describe sequencing and genomic information analysis of the entire genome of the type strain of M. aeruginosa, NIES-843T, in order to further our understanding of the complex association between genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of this species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingMicrocystis aeruginosa NIES-843 (M. aeruginosa) was obtained from Microbial Culture Collection of National Institute for Environmental Studies (MCC-NIES) (http://www.nies.go.jp/biology/mcc/home.htm). Total cellular DNA was purified according to standard procedures, and two genomic libraries for sequencing were constructed, using two types of cloning vectors: MA, with inserts of ∼2.6 kb cloned into pUC118 (Takara Bio. Inc., Japan), and MAB, with inserts of ∼34 kb cloned into a BAC vector pCC1BAC (Epicentre Bio., USA).Genome sequencing was performed using the whole-genome shotgun method in combination with BAC end sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of both ends of the clones from the MA and the MAB libraries were analyzed using a Dye-terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and the DNA sequencing systems MegaBase4000 (GE Healthcare, USA), type 3730XL (Applied Biosystems, USA), and DeNOVA-5000HT (Shimadzu Co., Japan). The accumulated sequences were assembled using the Phrap program (http://phrap.org/). The end-sequence data from the BAC clones facilitated the gap-closure process, and provided the scaffolding for reconstruction of the sequence of the entire genome. The final gaps in the sequence were filled either by primer walking or by sequencing PCR products that encompassed the gaps. The integrity of the reconstructed genome sequence was assessed by walking through the genome with the end sequences of the BAC clones.2.2. Gene assignment, annotation, and information analysesRNA- and protein-encoding regions were assigned by a combination of computer prediction and similarity searches, as described previously.12Genes for structural RNAs were identified by similarity searches against an in-house structural RNA database that had been constructed based on the data in CyanoBase (http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/). tRNA- and rRNA-encoding regions were predicted by use of the tRNA scan-SE 1.23 program13 and the RNAmmer ver.1.1d program,14 respectively, in combination with similarity searches.The prediction of protein-encoding regions was carried out with the Glimmer 3.02 prediction program.15 Prior to prediction, a matrix was generated for the M. aeruginosa genome by training with a data set of 3406 open reading frames that showed a high degree of sequence similarity to genes registered in the translated EMBL protein database Rel. 37.2 (TrEMBL). All of the predicted protein-encoding regions equal to or longer than 150 bp were translated into amino acid sequences, which were then subjected to similarity searches against the TrEMBL database using the BLASTP program.16 In parallel, all the predicted intergenic sequences were compared with sequences in the TrEMBL database using the BLASTX program, to identify genes that were not detected by the prediction process. For predicted genes that did not show sequence similarity to known genes, only those equal to or longer than 150 bp were considered candidates.Functions of the assigned genes were deduced based on the sequence similarity of their translated protein products to those of genes of known function and to the protein motifs in the InterPro database (ver. 16.0).17 A BLAST score of 10−5 was considered significant.Assignment of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) of predicted gene products was carried out by the BLASTP analysis against the COG reference data set18 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/). A BLAST E-value of less than E = 10−10 was considered significant. After filtering, COG assignments of the putative gene products were generated according to COG identification, taking the best-hit pair in the reference data set.Multicopy DNA elements of longer than 500 bp having a capacity to encode a putative transposase were identified as insertion sequences (ISs) using the BLAST2 program, then classified by RECON1.0519 and IS finder (www-is.biotoul.fr).Multiple copy elements of less than 600 bp long flanked by inverted repeats were identified as miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) using the BLAST2 and the RECON programs.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and structural features of the M. aeruginosa genomeThe nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of M. aeruginosa was determined using the modified whole genome shotgun method, as described in Section 2. A total of 55 246 random sequences corresponding to ∼6.5 genome equivalents were assembled to generate draft sequences. Finishing was carried out by visually editing the draft sequences and by additional sequencing to close the gaps. The integrity of 98.6% of the final genome sequence was assessed by comparing the insert length of anchored BAC clones with the computed distance between the end sequences of the clones. Sixteen remaining gaps were closed by sequencing of the ends of the plasmid clones or of PCR products. The genome of M. aeruginosa was a circular molecule of 5 842 795 bp with an average GC content of 42.3%. No plasmid was detected during the course of this study. Nucleotide positions were assigned based on the predicted translational initiation site of the homolog of sll0611 (solanesyl diphosphate synthase gene in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803)20 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The innermost circle of Fig. 1 shows the distribution of GC content in the genome. There was no characteristic pattern, according to GC skew analysis. An 8 bp palindromic sequence (5′GCGATCGC3′) termed HIP1 is frequently found in the genomes of a variety of cyanobacteria.21 HIP1 was present in the M. aeruginosa genome (1821 copies), and the frequency of occurrence (1 copy/3209 bp) was 2.6–2.8-fold lower than Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (1 copy/1131 bp), and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (1 copy/1219 bp).Schematic representation of the circular chromosome of M. aeruginosa.

Structural features of M. aeruginosa genesTwo copies of an rRNA gene cluster were assigned at coordinates 1 885 814–1 890 709 and 3 593 859–3 598 753 of the genome, in the sequence of 16S-trnI-23S-5S, and in the opposite direction to what is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. A total of 42 tRNA genes, including those in the rRNA gene clusters, were identified, representing 41 tRNA species (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1). Most of the tRNA genes were dispersed throughout the genome and are likely to be transcribed as single units, with the exception of those in the rRNA gene clusters and trnT-GGU-trnY-GUA (Supplementary Fig. 2). No introns were found in any tRNA gene species. M. aeruginosa had a single gene for transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), which is known to be involved in the degradation of aberrantly synthesized proteins. Putative genes for small RNAs that showed sequence similarity to the B subunit of RNase P, signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA, and 6Sa RNA were assigned based on sequence similarity to reported genes.The potential protein-encoding regions were assigned using a combination of computer prediction by the Glimmer program and similarity search, as described in Section 2. By taking into account sequence similarity to known genes and relative position, to avoid overlaps, the total number of putative protein-encoding genes assigned to the genome was 6312. The average gene density was one gene per 925 bp. The putative protein-encoding genes that started with ATG, GTG, TTG, or ATT were denoted by a serial number with the prefix ‘MAE’, representing the species name M. aeruginosa (Supplementary Fig. 1). The codon usage frequency of all the gene components in the genome is listed in Supplementary Table 2. It should be noted that the putative genes assignments in this paper represent coding potential based on a defined set of assumptions.Functional assignment of the 6312 putative protein-encoding genes was performed by similarity searches against the InterPro and TrEMBL databases, as described in Section 2. The number of genes with sequence similarity to genes of known function was 2588 (41%), 2304 (36%) showed sequence similarity to hypothetical genes, and the remaining 1433 (23%) did not show significant similarity to any registered genes.COG assignment of the translated gene products was carried out by BLASTP search against the COG reference data set. A total of 3304 putative gene products encoded by M. aeruginosa were assigned to 1373 COG identifications in 20 COG categories (Supplementary Fig. 3). In comparison, 2812 of 3314 genes assigned in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were classified into 20 COG categories using the same parameters. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, there was marked over-representation in the ‘Replication, recombination, and repair’ category in M. aeruginosa, due to the presence of a large number of transposase genes, as described in Section 3.3.1.A search of the genome sequences of M. aeruginosa and 27 additional cyanobacteria against the InterPro database (release v12.0) using the InterProScan (v3.2) program detected 2017 Pfam domains (Supplementary Table 3). A total of 1384 domains were found in the M. aeruginosa genome, 777 of which were common to all cyanobacterial species examined. Nineteen domains were unique to M. aeruginosa. They consisted of the following IDs: DUF204, PP2C, 2_5_RNA_ligase, CHAP, Chlorophyllase, DUF1080, DUF1702, Eco57I, EcoRI, Gal-bind_lectin, Glyco_transf_22, Lipoxygenase, NodZ, PEPCK_ATP, PhnA_Zn_Ribbon, Ricin_B_lectin, Thymidylat_synt, Transposase_31, and tRNA-synt_1f, including two domains of restriction enzymes (CyanoBase, http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/). The top 30 Pfam domains in M. aeruginosa are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Note that M. aeruginosa harbors a smaller number of domains related to signal transduction systems (HisKA, Response_reg, GAF, PAS, and HAMP) compared with other freshwater cyanobacteria (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). This may be due to the thick gelatinous sheath material that covers M. aeruginosa cells and protects them from severe environmental changes.3.3. Characteristic features of the genes and the genomeISs are small mobile DNA elements capable of transposition mediated by a self-encoded transposase, and can be classified into various families. ISs have been reported in diverse genera of cyanobacteria, including Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (73 copies in five families),22Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (65 copies in seven families),12Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (59 copies in four families),23 and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 (22 copies in four families)24 (Fig. 2). A total of 452 copies of ISs were assigned in the M. aeruginosa genome that fit the parameters described in Section 2. They appeared to be distributed rather evenly throughout the genome (Fig. 1). The putative ISs could be classified into 35 groups of 13 families on the basis of similarity and the type of transposase (www-is.biotoul.fr) (Fig. 2, Table 1, and Supplementary Table 5). Four types of ISs have been reported in M. aeruginosa, PCC 7806.25 By combining and re-analyzing all the ISs identified in the two strains, we were able to classify the ISs in Microcystis into 37 groups. They were designated as ISMae1 to ISMae37, four of which (ISMae1 to ISMae4) have previously been characterized in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (Table 1). ISMae1 and ISMae4 were common to two Microcystis species (10 copies and 33 copies, respectively, in NIES-843), whereas ISMae3 was absent from, and only truncated fragments of ISMae2 were found in the genome of NIES-843.Distribution of IS families in cyanobacteria and Escherichia coli.

They can be identified as multiply copy elements of less than 600 bp long flanked by inverted repeats.26 We searched for MITEs that were present at more than 20 copies in the M. aeruginosa genome, and identified 517 copies that were 150–435 bp in length, including partial segments. These elements were classified into eight groups on the basis of similarity (MaeMITEa–MaeMITEh), as shown in Fig. 1, Table 1, and Supplementary Table 6.One of the most distinctive features of the M. aeruginosa genome was its extremely high content of mobile DNA elements. A total of 688 kb of the genome (11.8% of the entire genome) were occupied by ISs (583 kb, 10.0% of the genome) and MITEs (105 kb, 1.8% of the genome). Traces of mutations and/or genome rearrangements caused by transposition of these elements have been detected in our preliminary analysis. These observations suggested that there is a high degree of genome plasticity in M. aeruginosa due to the large number of mobile repetitive elements. However, the implication as to why the genome of this cyanobacterium is so rich in various mobile elements and how and to what extent they have contributed to the phylogenetic establishment as well as to the genomic characteristic of M. aeruginosa is at the moment not clear. Further analysis of these mobile elements with respect to these points remains to be performed.Three non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters were found in the genome of M. aeruginosa: the microsystin synthase gene cluster (mcyA-J) at coordinates 3 486 436–3 541 027, the cyanopeptolin synthase gene cluster (mcnA-C and mcnE-G) at coordinates 5 526 971–5 557 378, and a novel unknown NRPS gene cluster at coordinates 5 202 708–5 219 745.The microsystin synthase (mcy) gene cluster consist of two subclusters that are transcribed in opposite directions: one encodes NRPSs with accessory domains (mcyA, mcyB, and mcyC)27 and the other encodes PKS (mcyD), mixed PKS-NRPS (mcyE and mcyG) and a racemase (mcyF).28 Two additional genes (mycI and mycJ) that participate in microcystin synthesis and a gene possibly involved in microcystin transportation (mcyH) are located downstream of the mcyDEFG subcluster.29–30 Overall, the primary structure of the mcy gene cluster in M. aeruginosa was consistent with those reported previously. An intriguing hypothesis is that the ISs and MITEs that were scattered around the mcy gene cluster are involved in the transposition of the cluster between individuals, thus contributing to the instability (presence or absence)31 and genetic diversity of mcy genes in natural populations of M. aeruginosa.32,33It has been suggested that a gene for thioesterase, mcyT, located within the mcy gene cluster in another microcystin producing cyanobacterium, Planktothrix agardhii, is responsible for the induction of cyanotoxin production.34,35 In M. aeruginosa, a putative gene for the thioesterase superfamiliy protein was found outside of the mcy gene cluster (MAE08510, at coordinates 747 362–747 778).Binding of a 4′-phosphopantethein (4-PPT) to a peptidyl carrier protein is required for microcystin biosynthesis. This binding reaction is catalyzed by the 4-PPT transferase (4-PPTase).36 A putative 4-PPTase gene (MAE07060) was found in the genome of M. aeruginosa. It is highly likely that this gene is involved in microcystin biosynthesis, since this was the only candidate gene for 4-PPT identified in the genome. Of note, the gene showed sequence similarity to that of the 4-PPTase that is involved in nodularin synthesis in Nodularia spumigena,37 and was located distant from the mcy gene cluster.Cyanopeptolin is an another well-known bioactive peptide,2 and a gene cluster for the synthesis of this peptide contained presumptive genes for four NRPSs (McnE, McnC, McnB, and McnA), a protein with unknown function, a transposase, McnF (ABC transporter-like protein), and McnG (unknown). Microcystis cf. wesenbergii NIVA-CYA 172/5 has a mcnD gene encoding a halogenase that is required for halogenation of cyanopeptolins.38 However, we did not identify a mcnD homolog in the genome of strain NIES-843, which indicates that this strain may produce a non-halogenated variant of cyanopeptolin. As was the case with the mcy gene cluster, several genes for transposases were located at the both ends of the cyanopeptolin gene cluster, which may also account for the instability and possible lateral transposition of this gene cluster.We also identified a series of putative genes for NRPSs that was superficially similar to the cyanopeptolin gene cluster, and a putative polyketide synthase gene cluster (PKS) of unknown function (coordinates 2 508 556–2 513 289). The presence of these gene clusters suggested that additional small polypeptides are produced in M. aeruginosa, although the production of polypetides other than microcystins has not been reported in this strain.The gas vesicles allow the Microcystis cells to float at the surface of various water environments, position them under the favorable light and oxygen conditions for growth, leading to bloom formation.3 Thus, the gas vesicles are of taxonomical and ecological importance.M. aeruginosa NIES-843 harbored the same set of gvp genes (gvpAI, AII, AIII, C, N, J, X, K, F, G, V, and W at the coordinates 3 399 358–3 407 222) as those in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 and 9354.39 The overall physical organization of the gvp region in the genome of NIES-843 is also equivalent to those of PCC 7806 and 9354. The major constituent of the gas vesicles is a small hydrophobic protein, GvpA, encoded by gvp AI–AIII, which are arranged along ribs that form the cylinder and cones.40 The amino acid sequence of GvpA is highly conserved and identical even between strains that produce gas vesicles of different width.41 The amino acid sequence of GvpA in NIES-843 was identical to those of PCC 7806 and BC 8401, except that replacement one amino acid occurred for GvpAI in PCC 7806. Another major component is GvpC, encoded by gvpC, a hydrophilic protein of ∼160 amino acid residues, which attaches to the outer surface of the gas vesicle42 and might affect the gas vesicle width.43 Four consecutive 33 amino acid residue repeat (33RR), which is highly conserved in some genera of cyanobacteria, were identified in the inferred amino acid sequences of GvpC in NIES-843, as is in PCC 7806.39 The amino acid sequence of NIES-843 GvpC showed 93% and 95% identity with those of PCC 7806 and BC 8401, respectively, except one missing 33RR in BC 8401.Cyanobacteria generally harbor a substantial number of genes that encode elements of two-component regulatory systems, the most simple of which is represented by histidine kinase and a response regulator.44 For example, 88 genes related to two-component systems have been identified in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (3.95 Mb for the chromosome and the plasmids), and 185 genes in the genome of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (7.21 Mb).12,20,45 In contrast, 22 genes for histidine kinases and 23 genes for response regulators were identified in the 5.83 Mb genome of M. aeruginosa (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 5). Five genes for histidine kinases, MAE03210 (hik34), MAE14410 (hik2), MAE36080 (hik33, dspA, nblS, dfr), MAE52650 (sphS), MAE60820 (sasA), are conserved in all the cyanobacterial genomes sequenced to date, including that of M. aeruginosa, which suggests that they have an essential role in cyanobacteria.46 In addition to orthologs of previously reported genes for histidine kinases in cyanobacteria, M. aeruginosa was unique in that it harbored two genes for histidine kinases (MAE46010 and MAE48940), and two genes for hybrid histidine kinases (MAE21690 and MAE37480).Five sets of genes for histidine kinases and response regulators were located adjacent to each other, and the remaining genes were scattered throughout the chromosome. Cognate pairs could be deduced for only 11 sets of histidine kinases and response regulators, based on previous studies of orthologous two-component systems in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301,47 as well as the gene organization in M. aeruginosa (Supplementary Fig. 5). Pairwise relationships between the remaining components have yet to be clarified.A two-component system, Hik7 (SphS) and Rre29 (SphR), regulates the expression of genes that encode proteins for phosphate acquisition, i.e. the ABC-type phosphate transporter, the periplasmic alkaline phosphatase, and the extracellular nuclease, in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.47 SphR has been shown to bind to the pho box, PyTTAAPyPy(T/A), which is located upstream of the genes it regulates.47M. aeruginosa contained several genes that presumably encode proteins involved in phosphate acquisition: three operons that encoded subunits for ABC-type phosphate transporters (MAE18310–MAE18280, MAE18380–MAE18340, and MAE09280–MAE09250), three monocistronic genes for phosphate-binding periplasmic proteins (MAE18390, MAE32380, and MAE38290), and two genes for alkaline phosphatases (MAE50240 and MAE16640). The consensus core sequence of the pho box motif was present upstream of the MAE18310 and MAE18380 operons (Supplementary Fig. 6), which suggested that these operons are regulated by homologs of Hik7 (SphS, a product of MAE52650) and Rre29 (SphR, a product of MAE52640) in M. aeruginosa, under phosphate-deprivation conditions. MAE52630, a homolog of sphU, which encodes a regulator of the SphS–SphR two-component system, was located downstream of the SphS–SphR genes,48 as observed in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.12In addition to genes for the response regulators, 43 genes encoded putative transcriptional factors in the M. aeruginosa genome (Supplementary Table 8). This number is comparable to other cyanobacteria. Some of them were common to other cyanobacteria and their biological functions have been investigated. These include genes for NtcA (a global regulator for nitrogen assimilation),49 NtcB (a regulator of nitrate assimilation),50 RbcR (a regulator of genes for Rubisco),51 NdhR (a regulator of genes for subunits of NAD dehydrogenase),52 SyCrp1 (a cAMP receptor protein for cell motility),53 HrcA (an inhibitor of genes for GroESL),54 and ZiaR (a regulator of the zinc efflux system).55 However, the functions of most of the putative transcriptional factors, including 10 genes that were unique to M. aeruginosa, have yet to be clarified.The genome of M. aeruginosa contained 24 genes for putative serine/threonine protein kinases, including multidomain kinases, and two genes for serine/threonine protein phosphatases (Supplementary Table 9). Although some of the genes for serine/threonine protein kinases were homologous to those characterized in other cyanobacteria, such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the function of the most of these genes in M. aeruginosa is unknown. Two genes encoding a presumptive serine/threonine protein phosphatase showed sequence similarity to the gene for PphA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. PphA is involved in the dephosphorylation of PII, which regulates nitrogen assimilation.56M. aeruginosa contained two copies of putative glnB genes, which encode PII proteins (MAE59130 and MAE57460), whereas other cyanobacteria contain a single copy of the glnB gene, with the exception of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421.We searched genes for restriction-modification enzymes (RM) in the M. aeruginosa genome using a BLAST search against an RM gene set in the Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE).57 We identified 62 putative RM genes, including four Type I RMs and 58 Type II RMs. Five solitary restriction enzymes and 27 solitary methyltransferases were assigned (Supplementary Table 10). In addition, we found four potential RM-related loci (MAE05060–MAE05130, MAE10650–MAE10670, MAE60340–MAE60360, and MAE29970–MAE30000) that were disrupted by the insertion of ISs. The recognition sequences of NspHI (RCATGY) (1 in every 254 kb), AvaIII (ATGCAT) (1 in every 216 kb), and NspV (TTCGAA) (1 in every 209 kb) were present at an extremely low frequency in the M. aeruginosa genome (Supplementary Table 10).Genes related to photosynthesis are listed in Supplementary Table 11. Complete sets of genes for both photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) were present in the M. aeruginosa genome. There were several distinctive features of these genes in M. aeruginosa, as follows: (i) a C-terminal partial segment of psbA (MAE10410) was found, in addition to five copies of a putative psbA gene, which encodes the reaction center D1 complex of PSII; (ii) a putative psbN gene, which encodes a PSII small subunit, was duplicated (MAE36550 and MAE36570) only in M. aeruginosa; (iii) seven copies of a putative ndhD gene, which encodes NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4, were assigned—the ndhD5 gene was present in triplicate (MAE23750, MAE23770, and MAE23790), whereas ndhD1, ndhD2, ndhD3, and ndhD4 were present in a single copy; (iv) in addition to complete sets of putative cpcA–cpcG (phycocyanin) and apcA–apcF (allophycocyanin), another gene cluster (MAE51670–MAE51680) that showed sequence similarity to cpcA–cpcB was present.Supplementary data"

IntroductionSoybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., supplies a large amount of high-quality protein and oil for food products and industrial materials. Recently, researchers have reported that various biochemical constituents of soybean seeds exert physiological functions beneficial to human health.1–3 The availability of numerous characteristics in soybean, such as symbiosis with root bacteroids, has set the stage for international efforts to explore soybean at the whole genome level.4,5 In modern genomics, the size of soybean genome (1.12–1.81 × 109 bp) has been considered to be moderate.6 Evolutionally, soybean is referred to as a recently diploidized tetraploid, and generally more than two copies are present for over 90% of the non-repetitive sequences in the soybean genome.7 In addition, 40–60% of the soybean sequences are repetitive.8,9 In the crop legumes, most crops belong to either the Hologalegina or the Phaseoloid lineage.10 Although two model legumes, Lotus and Medicago, belong to the Hologalegina lineage, it has been recently proposed that soybean genome could be used as a model for the Phaseoloid legumes due to the economic and biological importance of soybean, the moderate genome size, as well as the existing infrastructure for soybean research and commercial production.5,11An accurate and saturated genetic linkage map of soybean is essential for studies on modern soybean genomics, i.e. identification of subtle or new trait loci including quantitative trait loci (QTLs), map-based cloning, and physical map construction or even whole-genome sequencing. The first soybean genetic map was constructed with 57 classical markers.12 Thereafter, molecular maps have been gradually integrated using restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers,13–16 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers,17 simple sequence repeat (SSR)18,19 and amplified-fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers.20,21 In recent years, integrated maps have been reported, each of which was merged from several maps derived from different mapping populations using JoinMap.22,23 More recently, an integrated map with sequence-based genic markers has also been constructed.24Moshidou Gong503 (Glycine gracilis), which originated in Northeast China, is morphologically intermediate between the cultivated G. max and the wild form, G. soja.25 However, these three forms which are fully cross-compatible, effectively constitute a single species, G. max.25,26 Crosses between the cultivar (Misuzudaizu) and the intermediate form (Moshidou Gong503) would provide good genetic resources for linkage map construction and for the isolation of agronomically and biologically important genes. A framework of genetic linkage map had been previously constructed mainly with RFLP and SSR markers using a single F2 population of this combination.27–29 In addition, several agronomically and biologically important trait loci such as flowering time, growth habit, and seed quality were identified using this mapping population27,28 and its progenies (RILs).30,31 Further integration of this linkage map with a large number of SSR or RFLP markers and with other types of markers, i.e. AFLP or AFLP-derived sequence-tagged site (STS) markers, may enable to make this linkage map more informative and more useful for soybean genomics studies and particularly for the isolation of agronomically and biologically important QTL genes harbored by the parents, Misuzudaizu and Moshidou Gong503. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were threefold; (i) to develop AFLP and AFLP-derived STS markers; (ii) to develop a larger number of SSR and RFLP markers; and (iii) to integrate the newly developed markers into the framework of the previously described linkage map.282. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA extractionA framework of the genetic linkage map had been previously constructed using an F2 population that was derived from a cross between the cultivar Misuzudaizu and a weedy form, Moshidou Gong 503, as ovule and pollen parents, respectively. This mapping population consisting of 190 F2 plants was used in the present study.27,28 However, the DNA was newly extracted for the present study from the leaves that had been preserved at −80°C, using the CTAB method32 with a slight modification.2.2. AFLP marker developmentThe AFLP procedure was performed essentially as described by Vos et al.33 A total of 100–150 ng of genomic DNA was completely digested with EcoRI and MseI. Digested DNA was subjected to ligation with adapters that were compatible with the restriction sites (AFLP Core Reagent Kit, Life Technology, USA). After ligation, the reaction mixtures were diluted 10 times with TE. For the amplification of the restricted and ligated fragments, a two-step protocol was adopted. The first step included the selective pre-amplification of adapter-ligated DNA with primers with one additional selective nucleotide (+1/+1). In the second step, selective amplification of pre-amplified DNA was performed with adapter primers with two more additional selective nucleotides (+3/+3). All the amplification reactions were performed with TaKaRa EXTaq (TaKaRa, Japan). Electrophoresis was conducted by high-efficiency genome scanning (HEGS)34,35 with non-denaturing 11–13% polyacrylamide separating gels and 5% stacking gels. Gels were stained by Vistra Green (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) and were detected with FluorImager 585 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Only clearly distinguishable polymorphic AFLP bands were scored for mapping in the present study.Nomenclature for the AFLP markers includes the letter E for the EcoRI primer and the letter M for the MseI primer, each of which being followed by a number representing combinations of three selective nucleotides. The letter C was added as the prefix referring to the marker developed at Chiba University.2.3. Development of STS markers from AFLP, BAC-end, or EST sequencesCompared with AFLP markers, STS markers are more valuable in marker-assisted selection (MAS) and more transferable between populations. Therefore, polymorphic AFLP fragments were converted into STS markers by cloning and sequencing. At first, polymorphic AFLP bands amplified from Misuzudaizu or Mashidou Gong 503 were excised from the polyacrylamide gel. DNA was extracted using a freeze-squeeze method (Xia et al., unpublished). These fragments were cloned using the pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega, USA). Positive clones were confirmed by colony PCR.36 Plasmid DNA was isolated using the PI-200 Automatic DNA isolation system (Kurabo, Japan). Sequencing was performed using the ABI BigDye 3 system and analyzed using the ABI Prism3100 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Vector sequences were trimmed out using Chromas (version 2.23) (http://www.technelysium.com.au). After BLAST search against GenBank, all the retrotransposons or other repetitive sequences were discarded.37 A local sequence database was constructed by pooling the all sequences together using BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). Accordingly, all the sequences were searched over the local database to identify any orthologous sequences targeting for co-dominant marker development (Fig. 1). A total of 415 pairs of primers were designed to specific AFLP-derived sequences on line using Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi).Strategy for developing AFLP-derived STS markers. See section 2 for details.Strategy for developing AFLP-derived STS markers. See section 2 for details.Furthermore, 150 primer pairs were designed to BAC-end sequences38,39 (http://www.soybeangenome.siu.edu). Among them, ∼75 primer pairs were kindly provided by D. A. Lightfoot, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA. In addition, ∼50 and 60 primer pairs were designed to cDNAs from developing seeds and to expressed sequence tag (EST) homologs of flowering time-related genes,40 respectively.For the mapping of new STS markers, all the primer pairs were initially tested for polymorphism between the two parents using HEGS34,35 and single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP)41 techniques. The primer pairs showing a clear polymorphism between the two parents were mapped with HEGS, whereas the primer pairs with subtle polymorphisms were alternatively mapped with SSCP. The STS markers being developed at Chiba University were referred to as CSTS.2.4. SSR marker developmentIn the early version of the linkage map, 96 SSR markers were mapped. Among them, 75 were developed at the USDA and DuPont Corporation and 21 SSR markers at Chiba University. In the present study, new SSR markers were mainly developed from genomic DNA or by surveying EST-SSR in the database. To isolate DNA fragments including SSRs with CA and CT repeats, a magnetic bead method was used for enrichment of the motif-containing sequences. The genomic DNA of Norin No.2 was digested with EcoRI and MseI. Digested DNA was ligated with adapters as described in AFLP marker development. After ligation, the fragments bearing CA and CT repeats were enriched with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic particles (Promega) probed with 3′-biotinylated (TG)8 and (AG)8 oligonucleotides, respectively. The enriched fraction was refined using SUPREC®-02 (TaKaRa), amplified by MseI and EcoRI primers and ligated to pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega), and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α (Toyobo, Japan). The transformants were screened by blue–white selection. The positive clones were identified by colony hybridization using a DIG Luminescent Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics, USA) with DIG-labeled (TG)8 or (AG)8 probes. The PCR products of the positive clones were sequenced and the primers were designed using Primer 3 on line. In some cases, a dual-step method42,43 was used to isolate CA and CT-motif SSRs. The procedure was performed as previously described by Tamura et al.44 (AT)n(AC)n-motif SSRs were isolated using the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads described earlier, since this type of repeat is abundant in the soybean genome and AT repeats are difficult to screen directly due to the self-complementarity of the probe sequence. The SSR markers including AC, AG, AT, AAC, AAG, AAT, ACG, AGT, ATG, GGA, GGC, and GCT core-motifs were developed from motif-containing EST sequences. These sequences were identified by homology search of motif repeats against the EST data in DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) by FASTA. The minimum number of repeats for dinucleotide motif and trinucleotide motif SSRs was set to 10 and 7, respectively. The SSR markers developed at Chiba University were referred to as CSSRs in the present study.2.5. RFLP analysisOn the basis of the earlier version of the linkage map,28 additional soybean cDNA clones derived from green leaves and clones of up-regulated genes in the nodules of Lotus japonicus45 were employed as probes to generate RFLP markers. The DNA was digested with eight restriction enzymes, ApaI, BamHI, BglII, DraI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, and KpnI. Electrophoresis, Southern blotting and hybridization procedures were performed as previously described.272.6. Linkage map constructionMost of the markers were mapped with F2 population consisting of 192 individuals. However, ∼200 markers, including newly developed RFLP and AFLP-derived STS markers, were mapped with 94 randomly selected F2 individuals. All the markers were checked against the expected 3:1 segregation by the χ2 test at a 5% significance level. The new marker data set was added to the original data set to produce the combined data set. Linkage analyses were performed using MAPMAKER (version 3) software.46 The commands ‘try’, ‘order’, and ‘build’ in MAPMAKER were used independently or in combination to insert new marker(s) into the framework of the previously described linkage map.28 Recombination frequencies were converted into map distance in centimorgans using the Kosambi mapping function.47 A LOD score of 3.0 and a maximum distance of 37.2 cM were used as linkage criteria for new marker insertion. The error detection function was set ‘on’ to detect any possible scoring errors. The linkage map was graphically visualized with MapChart.483. Results3.1. AFLP marker developmentOut of ∼800 primer pairs tested, 135 primer pairs that showed a clear polymorphism between the parents, Misuzudaizu and Moshidou Gong503, were selected for further analysis for the whole F2 population. Approximately 15–30 main bands were clearly amplified per primer combination. Each selected primer combination generated between 1 and 6 polymorphic bands (Fig. 2). The polymorphism rate of AFLPs was 4.8%, a value lower than the 11.3% value reported for barley49 and 14.8% for sorghum.50 The DNA quality, PCR, electrophoresis, and subsequent staining can all influence AFLP profiling. The HEGS system used in the present study generated clear and reproducible AFLP profiles within a range of 200–1200 bp, ensuring accurate genotype scoring (Fig. 2). The total number of bands generated and fragment intensity appeared to be negatively related to some extent. High GC content for both EcoRI + 3 and MseI + 3 selective nucleotides normally generated few but clear fragments, whereas a lower GC content led to a larger number of fragments with a lower quality. This phenomenon could be explained by the unusually high A + T nucleotide content in the soybean genome.51AFLP marker analysis of the F2 mapping population. The left two lanes denoted by Mi and Mo were generated from the parents, Misuzudaizu and Moshidou Gong 503, respectively, with a combination of AFLP primers, E35(GAG) and M7(CTG). Lanes 3–21 were generated from the F2 population with the same primer combination. Arrows on the left side of the gel indicate mapped AFLP markers. Molecular weight marker ΦX174 HaeIII is shown in the lane denoted by M with the size (in bp) on the right side of the gel.AFLP marker analysis of the F2 mapping population.

However, 40 redundant markers, which were generated from the same combination and displayed the same genotype, were excluded. Apart from 10 unlinked markers and 5 unsuccessfully positioned markers, a total of 318 AFLP markers were successfully integrated into the framework of the previously described linkage map.28 Among the mapped markers, 164 markers showed a predominance for Misuzudaizu, whereas 154 markers for Moshidou Gong 503. Among the 164 markers with a predominance for Misuzudaizu, 149 (90.9%) markers segregated in a 3:1 ratio, whereas 9 and 6 markers segregated in 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, respectively. Among the 154 markers with a predominance for Moshidou Gong 503, 143 (92.9%) markers segregated in a 3:1, whereas 5 and 6 markers segregated in 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, respectively. The overall distortion rate of 8.2% was much lower than the 40% rate reported for two intraspecific crosses between two annual species of Medicago.52 Segregation distortion may be related to the differential parental genomes or to distorting factors such as sterility loci. Moreover, errors in genotyping scoring may also cause segregation distortion.23The 318 newly mapped markers were not uniformly distributed among the linkage groups (LGs) within a range of 3–31 per LG (Table 1). The number of new markers mapped to a given LG was not significantly correlated with the length of the LG (cM) [correlation coefficient, r = 0.1578 (P > 0.05)]. A certain degree of clustering of the AFLP markers was found in the putative centromeric or telomeric regions in LGs such as LGs B2, C1, D2, and E (Fig. 3). However, AFLP markers in the present study were not as strongly clustered as these reported by Qi et al.49 in barley and by Keim et al.21 in soybean. Although some researchers have reported a relatively uniform distribution of AFLP markers, it has been well documented in many crops, including soybean,21,49,50 that the strong clustering of AFLP markers is often associated with telomeric or centromeric regions. In the present study, the AFLP markers were generated using a restriction enzyme (EcoRI) that is insensitive to the methylation of CG dinucleotides. Thus, some particular regions, such as the heterochromatin regions around centromeres and telomeres, were accessible to EcoRI-based AFLP markers. Furthermore, in such regions, crossing-over during the meiosis was markedly reduced and the markers tended to cluster. In the present study, AFLP markers with a higher quality generated from a higher GC content in selective nucleotides may have to some extent reduced the level of clustering. The use of the enzymes PstI/MseI or TaqI/HindIII for AFLP marker generation might have further reduced the level of clustering of the AFLP markers, since either or both of the restriction enzymes are methylation sensitive.21,49,50 The AFLP markers presented here are accessible via the marker nomenclature (Supplementary Table S1).Soybean genetic linkage map constructed with RFLP, SSR, STS, and AFLP markers.

STS marker developmentOver 500 AFLP polymorphic fragments, including ∼200 mapped AFLP markers were successfully sequenced. Approximately 15% of them were associated with repetitive sequences, such as Ty3/Gypsy and STR120.37 Interestingly, ∼10% were related to mitochondria or chloroplast gene-related sequences. Of 415 pairs of primers were designed to the non-repetitive sequences, a total of 97 AFLP-derived STS markers were successfully mapped and integrated into the framework of the previously described linkage map28 (Fig. 3). Among them, 64 markers with clear polymorphisms were mapped using HEGS (Fig. 4B), whereas 33 markers were mapped with SSCP (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, 58 markers were co-dominant with our mapping population.Analysis of segregation of CSSR and CSTS markers using HEGS (A, CSSR60; B, CSTS73) and SSCP techniques (C, CSTS48).

The genotypes for each lane were indicated at the bottom of each lane.Initially, 30 AFLP-derived STS were converted from mapped AFLP markers, all of them being tagged to the same locus as the original AFLP markers being mapped. The other 67 markers were converted from randomly selected polymorphic AFLP bands. Among all the 97 AFLP-derived STS markers, 24 single, 7 double, 1 triple, 1 quadruple, and 1 quintuple markers were mapped to 34 loci, at which one or more AFLP markers had already resided. In addition, two double and two triple AFLP-derived STS markers were mapped to four loci at which no AFLP marker was tagged, suggesting that AFLP-derived STS markers also tended to be distributed in a clustering fashion as the AFLP markers do.Additionally, 19 STS markers were developed from 150 primer pairs designed to BAC-end sequences at a polymorphism rate of 12.6%. Among the 110 PCR primer pairs designed to cDNA or flowering time gene homologs in soybean, only 10 markers were mapped at a polymorphism rate of only 9.1%. Taken together, a total of 126 CSTS markers were mapped within a range of 1 to 16 markers per LG (Table 1). The number of STS mapped to a given LG was not significantly correlated with the length of the LG (cM) [correlation coefficient, r = 0.0216 (P > 0.05)].3.3. SSR marker developmentOut of 702 new SSRs, 121 SSR markers were successfully mapped in the present study, including 41 markers from genomic DNAs and 80 from the EST database. Along with the 20 CSSR markers mapped in the earlier version of the linkage map, a total of 61 genomic DNA-derived SSR markers were classified with different motifs, i.e. 27 with CT, 3 with AC, 1 with GTG, and 30 with compound-motif repeats. An example of segregation of CSSR60 is shown in Fig. 4A. Polymorphism rates of genomic SSRs were 8, 18, and 53% for AC repeats, CT repeats, and (AT)n(AC)n motif, respectively.Among the 80 EST-SSRs, 16 and 64 markers were developed from dinucleotide and trinucleotide motifs, respectively. Since the repeat numbers for the EST-SSRs are generally lower than those for genomic SSRs,22,39 we set the minimum repeat number for dinucleotides and trinucleotides to 10 and 7, respectively. The polymorphism was 25.15% (80/318) within a range of 15–50%, depending on the motifs, being slightly higher than the polymorphism rate of 18.0% reported by Song et al.22 Since we used HEGS and SSCP techniques for mapping, it was possible to detect subtle polymorphisms (Fig. 4B and C).A total of 318 SSR markers were mapped in 20 different LGs, within a range of 9–25 markers per LG (Table 1). SSR distribution was significantly correlated with the length of the LG (r = 0.4449, P < 0.05). In contrast to AFLP markers, the SSR markers were relatively evenly distributed, although slight clustering was observed in some specific regions. This slight clustering phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that SSR markers are significantly associated with the low-copy fractions of the plant genome.533.4. RFLP marker developmentIn addition to the 404 RFLP markers in the framework of the previously described linkage map,28 a total of 108 RFLP markers were newly generated with additional cDNA clones from green leaves and up-regulated cDNA clones in the nodules of L. japonicus as probes. These markers were successfully integrated into the existing linkage map framework. In total, 509 RFLP markers ware distributed among the LGs within a range of 13–44 markers per LG (Table 1). However, RFLP distribution was not significantly correlated with the length of the LG (r = 0.2905, P > 0.05).3.5. The characteristics of the current linkage mapOn the basis of the earlier version of the linkage map, a total of 318 AFLP, 121 SSR, 108 RFLP, and 126 STS markers were newly developed and integrated (Table 1, Fig. 3). The current genetic map is composed of 1277 loci at 2.41 cM intervals, covering a map distance of 3080 cM (Kosambi function) in 20 LGs. Most SSR and RFLP markers were relatively evenly distributed among the different LGs, although the AFLP markers were moderately clustered and several relatively large gaps still remained (Fig. 3). The coverage of the linkage map was extended since 17 markers were mapped beyond distal ends of the previous linkage map (Fig. 3). This is presently the densest linkage map developed from a single F2 population in soybean, although integrated maps, each of which was merged from several maps derived from different mapping populations, have been reported.23,243.6. Information about the developed markersThe information about the mapped markers regarding LG, map position, gene/accession numbers, and primer sequences and marker type is available in the online version of this article (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, primer information for about the STS and SSR markers, which were developed but not presented in Supplementary Table S1, is also accessible online-only (Supplementary Table S2).4. Discussion4.1. Marker order and position among different mapping populationsIn our updated linkage map, 139 SSR markers were shared with the LGs described by Song et al.22 Most markers were in consensus order in both LGs, indicating a significant correlation (r = 0.6064, P < 0.01) between the length of the LGs in both maps.22 However, reversions occurred in some regions in LGs A1, D2, and G. In the LG G, the order of Sat_223 and Sat_260 was 0.2 cM apart in the present map, whereas 0.22 cM apart with a reversed order in the linkage map constructed by Song et al.22 Comparison of different linkage maps constructed from different populations with a different genetic background using different marker sets indicated that most markers showed the consensus order, although some intervals or regions always displayed some discrepancy in the marker order or positions. This phenomenon may be due to inversion, insertion, deletion, or transition of genomic regions as well as meiotic drive and gametic or zygotic selection.23 Also, possible errors in genotyping scoring may distort marker orders and segregation ratios.23 In soybean, some markers, especially RFLP markers, could be mapped on more than one LG. Because soybean is an allotetraploid, it has been shown that for over 90% of the non-repetitive sequences in the soybean genome, there were two closely related copies at different loci.7 As reported earlier, there was some inconsistency existed between physical map and genetic map regarding the marker order and positions.54–56 With the new progress made in genome sequencing and comparative mapping, it is likely that these discrepancies or inconsistencies will be reduced or eventually clarified.4.2. AFLP-derived STS markersConversion of AFLP fragments into polymorphic STS markers would enable to achieve a high throughput scoring of genotypes in fine mapping and MAS in breeding.57 Development of AFLP-derived STS markers tend to be laborious and time-consuming due to the lower conversion efficiency. The lower polymorphism rate for STS or other markers22 may be due to the low sequence variation in soybean and its wild ancestor G. soja.24 Zhu et al.58 reported values of 0.5 and 4.7 SNPs/Kb in coding and non-coding perigenic DNA, respectively. As a result, the polymorphism rate was 10 times lower than that reported in maize.59,60 AFLP-derived STS markers developed in the present study displayed a high degree of transferability since most of them showed polymorphism in the RIL populations, Jack × Fukuyataka and Peking × Akita (Hwang et al., personal communication). Although 97 AFLP-derived STSs and 29 BAC and EST-derived STSs have been developed, the number is not necessarily large enough for a saturated map.4.3. Comparison with the earlier version of the linkage mapAs a total of 673 newly developed AFLP, SSR, RFLP, and STS markers in addition to 101 new public SSR markers were integrated, the average intermarker distance was reduced by more than twofold to 2.41 from 5.78 cM in the earlier version of the linkage map.28 In addition, the proportion of PCR-based markers was 34.8%, a much higher value than the 19.2% reported in the earlier version of the linkage map. A large gap of more than 37.5 cM in LG C1 was filled and two unlinked LGs for LG M were joined. The number of gaps of more than 25 cM was reduced to 6 from 19 in the earlier version of the linkage map.28 Similar large gaps were also present on the same or similar positions in a linkage map constructed from a RIL population derived from the current mapping population, using an other set of markers (Hayashi et al., unpublished result), indicating that some of these gaps may be partially associated with the nature of the genome structure of the parents. Some hot-spots of recombination may lead to enlarged gaps in the genetic linkage map, in spite of short physical distances. In addition, the degree of coverage of the newly constructed linkage map was improved, as 17 markers were mapped beyond the distal ends of the LGs in the previous linkage map.4.4. Usefulness of the linkage mapMap-based cloning requires very fine resolution mapping in the target interval, since the highest marker density can shorten chromosome walking. MAS is most effective when the markers are tightly linked to the gene of interest since crossing-over between the gene and markers dramatically decreases. In general, accurate and consistent integrated genetic and physical maps55,56 of the soybean genome should enable to distinguish new or subtle QTL(s) from any of the more than a thousand identified QTLs, and thereafter to clone and functionally confirm cloned QTL genes. Several agronomically and biologically important trait loci such as flowering time, growth habit, and seed quality have been identified with this mapping population28 and its progeny.31 In particular, 17 markers were tagged in the 5.7 cM interval between CE47M5a and Satt100 on LG C2, where various important QTLs were clustered. The current soybean linkage map became more informative and useful for positional cloning of agronomically important genes for traits including QTLs that are harbored by the parents. On the basis of this linkage map, several residual heterozygous lines (RHLs) have been developed from the progeny of this mapping population for fine-mapping of several QTLs.61 More than 30 primer pairs targeting SSR motifs have been specifically developed from physical contigs of the flowering time QTLs (FT1, FT2, and FT3), 70% of which displaying polymorphism between the parents. These markers should enable to further narrow the QTL gene regions toward the cloning of candidate QTL(s) (Xia et al. and Watanabe et al., unpublished results).Soybean originated in East Asia and the vast collection of wild species and landraces should provide useful genetic resources for studies on soybean genomics. Recent studies have revealed that a large number of wild species of soybean contain a wide range of secondary metabolite compounds, which have preliminarily been found to be beneficial to human health.1–3 Genetic differences in the secondary metabolite compounds between the cultivar Misuzudaizu and the intermediate weedy form Moshidou Gong 503 were also observed.4.5. Future perspectivesOwing to the presence of relatively large gaps or marker-sparse regions, targeted marker development via BAC sequencing62 is a powerful tool. An accurate and consistent integrated genetic map is useful for physical map development and whole genome sequencing. Conversely, a large number of targeted SSR and STS markers can be generated from genome sequencing for saturation of the linkage map in soybean. Furthermore, due to the lower polymorphism rate in the soybean genome, new types of markers such as SNP-based markers need to be gradually incorporated due to their abundance in the soybean genome and technical applicability.24 Ideally, near or over 10 000 evenly distributed PCR-based markers could satisfy most applications including QTL gene isolation, evolution studies, and other field of genomics.We wish to thank Professor J.

IntroductionSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] has been an important crop throughout much of human history, and it is used not only as a food, but also as an oil source, forage, and as a raw material for a variety of industrial materials. During the last 10 years, global soybean production has increased 1.8-fold and in 2006, production levels reached 236 million tons.1 Recently, soybean has drawn particular attention as an energy source, since it can be used as the principal source of biodiesel, an alternative fuel. Thus, soybean production is expected to increase further during the coming years.Due to its economic importance, many efforts have been made to develop genetic and genomic resources for soybean, including genetic linkage maps2–7 and expressed sequence tag (EST) collections.8 By 2006, soybean had the 6th largest EST collection,9 and in 2007, a transcriptional map comprising 1141 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was generated using these ESTs.10 Furthermore, sequencing of the entire soybean genome is in progress [http://soybeangenome.siu.edu], and the ultimate goal of this project is acceleration of the breeding process.With accumulating information and materials, more efficient approaches to breeding may be developed by merging genomic resources and applied genetics. An example of this new approach is the investigation of genomic diversity in soybeans, followed by identification of genes of agronomic importance. Hyten et al.11 compared genome structures in limited lengths of DNA (336–574 kb) from 120 genetically diverse soybean germplasms. The authors found a highly variable linkage disequilibrium (LD), not only among populations, but also between different regions of the genome. This finding suggests that the soybean genome comprises numerous DNA segments that exhibit various degrees of diversification, according to differing frequencies of genetic recombination. It is expected that dissection of the complex genome via evaluation of genome-wide allelic polymorphism of DNA markers, will contribute to our understanding of genomic diversity in soybean.Comparative genomics may represent another promising means of utilizing genomic resources for applied genetics. Recently, comparisons were performed between the genome structures of two model legumes (Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula) and other leguminous crops.12,13 A limited degree of macrosynteny was detected between the genomes of model and crop legumes, but these observations were far from conclusive, since only partial information was available for the comparison. With the accumulation of genomic information, such as nucleotide sequences and DNA markers, the accuracy of genomic comparisons will improve and knowledge may be transferred more efficiently from model systems to soybean.Among the various DNA markers invented thus far, EST-derived microsatellites are particularly popular because they exhibit the following characteristics: (i) they are cost-effective, especially when developed using publicly available EST information; (ii) they are informative because of their multi-allelic and co-dominant nature;14 (iii) they are useful for studying functional diversity in natural populations or germplasm collections since they are derived from transcription products;15 and (iv) they are transferable to other species and can be used for comparative mapping since most are derived from conserved coding sequences.15,16 With respect to soybean, although nearly 400 000 ESTs have been deposited in public DNA databases, only 24 polymorphic microsatellite markers have been generated using these ESTs.6In this study, we developed microsatellite markers using publicly available EST information and generated a genetic linkage map for the entire soybean genome. In addition, we examined allele polymorphism for all the mapped EST-derived microsatellite markers and considered each marker's transferability between soybean germplasms. Moreover, we compared the genome structures of L. japonicus and soybean and discussed the transferability of structural information between them.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant and DNA materialsIn order to construct a genetic linkage map for soybean, we used a mapping population of 94 individual plants, which represented the F8 generation of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an F2 population generated between the parent plants ‘Misuzudaizu’ and ‘Moshidou Gong 503’.5,7 ‘Misuzudaizu’ is a Japanese cultivar and ‘Moshidou Gong 503’ is a Chinese experimental line that is an intermediate between cultivated soybean and wild soybean (G. soja). The total DNA was extracted from the leaves of each plants by CTAB method.172.2. Development of microsatellite markersMicrosatellite or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) ≥13 nucleotides in length, which contained all possible combinations of di-nucleotide (NN), tri-nucleotide (NNN), and tetra-nucleotide (NNNN) repeat, were identified from soybean non-redundant ESTs in public databases (Dana-Farber Center Institute; http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi) using the a FindPatterns module from the GCG software package (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). In order to amplify DNA segments containing SSRs, primer pairs were designed using the Primer3 program18 in such a way that the amplified products ranged between 90 and 300 bp in length. PCR amplifications (5 µl) were performed on 0.5 ng soybean genomic DNA in 1 × PCR buffer (BIOLINE, London, UK), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.02 U BIOTAQTM DNA Polymerase (BIOLINE), 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 0.8 µM of each primer, using the modified ‘Touchdown PCR’ protocol described by Sato et al.19 PCR products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer and data collection was performed, as described previously.192.3. Linkage analysisThe MAPMAKER/EXP v3.0 program20 was used to analyse segregation data obtained from mapping the 94 RILs for microsatellite markers and previously reported RFLP, genomic-SSR, and phenotypic markers.7 Marker loci were analysed using the ‘group’ command with a threshold score of LOD = 3.0 and ‘ri self’ as the data type. The resulting linkage groups (LGs) were reorganized with reference to the integrated genetic map6 and a previously reported map for soybean.7 The order of marker loci and their relative genetic distances were calculated using the ‘Kosambi’ function with the ‘try’ and ‘map’ commands, respectively.2.4. Evaluation of mapped markers and allele frequency3. Results3.1. Development of microsatellite markers derived from soybean ESTsIn order to develop microsatellite markers for soybean, we performed in silico data mining, as described in Section 2. We designed 6920 primer pairs to amplify SSRs from 63 676 non-redundant soybean ESTs obtained from public DNA databases. PCR amplification of template DNA from the parents ‘Misuzudaizu’ and ‘Moshidou Gong 503’ was achieved with 5299 (76.6%) of the primer pairs examined; 4710 pairs amplified both lines and 589 amplified only one of the parents. Clear polymorphisms between the parents were observed with 680 (12.8%) of the 5299 primer pairs; 655 detected single loci, whereas 24 and one detected double and quadruple loci, respectively. Together with 10 dominant Sequenced Tagged Site (STS) marker loci, a total of 707 marker loci were chosen for linkage mapping. SSRs of di-nucleotide repeat motifs (NN) showed polymorphisms more frequently than tri-nucleotide repeat motifs (NNN) and in fact, the ‘AT’ motifs exhibited polymorphism (23.1%; 82 of 355 primer pairs) efficiently (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the largest number of primer pairs (1211) was tested for the ‘AAG’ motif and only 8.8% (107) exhibited polymorphism (Supplementary Table S1).3.2. Construction of a genetic linkage mapIn addition to 707 microsatellite markers developed in this study, we used 242 marker loci including 105 RFLP markers, 136 genome-derived microsatellite markers and one phenotypic marker that had been shown detect polymorphisms between mapping parents during construction of the genetic linkage map.7 Using the grouping module in MAPMAKER, 935 of 949 loci were assembled into 14 LGs, and these were then re-grouped into 20 LGs, according to the maps developed by Cregan et al.3 and Song et al.6 Ultimately, a total of 935 marker loci were mapped onto 20 LGs with a total genetic length of 2700.3 cM (Table 1 and Fig. 1), and 693 of the 935 loci detected were identified using the 668 EST-derived microsatellite markers developed in this study; the other 242 loci were detected using 105 RFLP markers, 136 genome-derived microsatellite markers and one phenotypic marker, as reported previously by Watanabe et al.7Genetic linkage map of the soybean genome. Twenty linkage groups were constructed using 105 RFLP markers (standard lettering), 136 genome-derived microsatellite markers (italic), one phenotypic marker (underlined), and 693 EST-derived microsatellite markers (bold). The marker loci indicated with an asterisk(s) show distorted loci, as determined using the Chi-square test (*P< 0.05, and **P< 0.01). Color codes inside the boxes on the right side of the marker loci indicate the level of PIC values from low (blue) to high (red), as shown on the left side of the panels. Detailed information on the EST-derived microsatellite markers is provided in Supplementary Table S2.Genetic linkage map of the soybean genome.

Detailed information on the EST-derived microsatellite markers is provided in Supplementary Table S2.Summary of the genetic linkage map and the mapped markersSummary of the genetic linkage map and the mapped markersAlthough the average marker loci for each LG was 46.8, the number of EST-derived microsatellite markers ranged from 48 (LG D1b) to 18 (LG A1), with an average of 34.7 (Table 1). The average genetic length for each LG was 135.0 cM, although the sizes varied between 194.0 (LG A2) and 75.5 (LG J) cM (Table 1). The average distance between markers in each LG ranged between 1.9 and 4.0 cM (LG J and LG A2, respectively).Most marker loci were relatively evenly distributed along the LGs, although some large gaps were observed between loci, including those between Sct_191 and GMES1325 (32.0 cM) on LG C1, and GMES1163 and A374 (25.2 cM) on LG E. The Chi-square test (P < 0.05) detected segregation distortion for 48 marker loci (5.1% of the mapped markers) and significant examples (less than P < 0.01) include the following: GMES0675, GMSE1633, and GMES6195 on LG B1; GM072, GMES3896, and GMES4020 on LG F; and GMES0289, GMES2783, and GMES6339 on LG I (Table 1).3.3. Polymorphism of EST-derived microsatellite markers among 24 soybean linesWe examined allelic variation among 23 soybean cultivars/lines and a wild soybean line using 668 EST-derived microsatellite markers, which corresponded to 686 marker loci on the genetic linkage map (Supplementary Table S2). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 9, with a mean value of 2.8 (Fig. 2a); marker loci detecting two alleles were the most frequent. PIC values ranged from 0.08 to 0.84, with a mean value of 0.40 (Fig. 2b); marker loci with PIC values between 0.40 and 0.50 (175 markers) were most common. Although the average PIC value of the ‘AT’ motif (0.52) was one of the highest identified in this study (Supplementary Table S1), no notable correlation could be found between PIC values and SSR motifs. Marker loci with the highest and lowest average PIC values were detected in LG G (0.50) and LG D2 (0.33), respectively (Table 1). In addition, we observed clusters of marker loci with higher and lower than average PIC values such as between GMES0651 and GMES3918 on LG G (average PIC was 0.60) and between GMES2955 and GMES1351 on LG M (average PIC was 0.21; Fig. 1).Allele frequency of mapped microsatellite markers in 23 soybean cultivars/lines and one wild soybean line.

Comparison between the genomes of soybean and L. japonicusWe compared genome structure between soybean and the model legume L. japonicus. We performed a BLASTN search with a cut off E-value of E-20 between nucleotide sequences from soybean ESTs that corresponded to mapped microsatellite markers and L. japonicus genomic clones that had been mapped to the genetic linkage map.22 We examined 668 soybean ESTs and found 293 that showed significant sequence similarity to the 367 genomic clones comprising the L. japonicus genome (Table 2). In particular, 236 of these ESTs aligned with single loci on the L. japonicus genome, whereas the remaining 57 matched multiple loci (Supplementary Table S2). Connections could be made between the linkage maps of soybean and L. japonicus using the positional information on ESTs, as well as matched genomic clones (Fig. 3). L. japonicus chromosome 1 (hereafter referred to as LjChr) exhibited the largest number of matched soybean marker loci (97 loci), whereas LjChr 6 had the fewest (28 loci; Table 2). This variation may reflect physical lengths of the L. japonicus chromosomes.22,23Genome alignment between soybean and L. japonicus. Twenty soybean linkage groups (GmLGs) and six L. japonicus chromosomes (LjChrs) were connected by lines based on sequences similarities, as described in Section 2. Vertical bars represent GmLGs (green background) and LjChrs (yellow background); horizontal lines indicate positions of loci showing sequence similarity between soybean and L. japonicus. The LjChrs were color-coded as follows: LjChr1; yellow, LjChr2; red, LjChr3; green, LjChr4; blue, LjChr5; light blue, LjChr6; pink. Portions of the soybean LGs were also color-coded, according to their similarity to the LjChrs.Genome alignment between soybean and L. japonicus.

It is also noteworthy that a single locus on the LjChrs often corresponded to two marker loci on different GmLGs, a finding that may indicate ancestral duplication of the entire soybean genome.254. DiscussionIn this study, a total of 6920 primer pairs (10.9%) were designed to amplify SSRs identified using a publicly available non-redundant soybean EST data set (63 676 ESTs). PCR amplification was achieved using 5299 (77%) of the 6920 primer pairs tested and 668 were located successfully onto the genetic linkage map. Altogether, ∼1% of the non-redundant ESTs could be used for development of DNA mapping markers and this study highlighted the applicability of soybean EST-SSRs for their development, although the actual efficiency of this process may differ depending upon the mapping populations.AAG was the most frequently detected SSR motif in our marker set, and its frequency was approximately twice that of next most common motifs ATC, AAC, and AG. Shultz et al.26 reported that AT was the most frequently detected SSR motif in BAC-end sequences and that it occurred three times more frequently than the next most common motifs (AAT and AAG). These results suggest that SSR motif frequencies differ between ESTs and the whole genome in soybean. On the other hand, polymorphism frequency was higher for di-nucleotide motifs than tri-nucleotide motifs (18.3% versus 7.9%), which is consistent with observations by Shultz et al.26 The average PIC of the di-nucleotide motifs (0.46) was higher than those of tri- and tetra-nucleotide motifs (0.38 and 0.37, respectively), which also suggests that the former are more polymorphic.The total length of the genetic linkage map generated in this study was 2700.3 cM, which was 1.1-fold greater than the previous consensus linkage map (2383.3 cM) generated by Choi et al.10 and thus, it is suggested that the present linkage map achieves a high degree of genome coverage. The genetic lengths of individual LGs in the present linkage map ranged from 0.8 (LG J) to 1.7 (LG C1) times those in the previous consensus map. When two maps are compared with respect to the common markers such as RFLP markers, the genetic distance and order on the present map fairly agreed with those on the consensus map except for LG E. In LG E, which was estimated to be 1.5-fold longer than that in the previous map, the genetic distances between any two common markers actually extended. In contrast, the genetic distances between the markers were quite similar between the two maps for LG C1, which was estimated to be 1.7-fold longer than that in the previous map, suggesting that the present map achieved longer genomic coverage.Though there were 26 gaps of larger than 10 cM between the markers in the previous consensus linkage map of soybean,6 the EST-derived SNP markers generated recently by Choi et al.10 were mapped onto 19 of the 26 gaps, indicating usefulness of EST-derived markers to secure the uniformity of the map. The EST-derived microsatellite markers generated in the present study were successfully mapped onto 25 out of 31 gaps of larger than 20 cM in the previous linkage map constructed with RFLP and genome-microsatellite markers by Watanabe et al.7 Two large gaps on LG C1 and E still remain in both the previous and the present maps possibly because of peculiar chromosome structures that hamper marker generation.We compared the ESTs used to develop the 1149 SNP markers identified by Choi et al.10 with the 668 non-redundant ESTs from which the mapped microsatellite markers originated in this study. Surprisingly, we found only 16 ESTs in common (data not shown), a finding that could be attributed to the different mapping populations used for detection of polymorphisms. However, it is more likely that the type of SNP and SSR polymorphism detected is a characteristic of the EST and thus, depends upon the gene from which it was derived and/or the position in the transcript. In general, the frequency of SNPs is higher than SSRs and thus in Zea mays, one SNP occurs every 28–124 bp, whereas one SSR is found every 8 kb.27 However, SNP markers are usually biallelic and less polymorphic than SSRs. Since SNP and microsatellite markers have such different characteristics, their combination should allow a larger number of EST-derived DNA markers to be mapped onto the genetic linkage map.The allele frequency of any given marker is closely related to its transferability among germplasms, as well as the degree of variability within the marker locus. In general, nucleotide sequences are more conserved in coding regions than in other regions of the genome. Therefore, it is expected that the PIC values of EST-derived markers may be lower than for markers derived from random genomic sequences. Hossain et al.28 demonstrated that on the genetic linkage map, EST-derived markers exhibited lower average PIC values (0.40) than random genome-derived microsatellite markers (0.61). Interestingly, the 668 EST-derived microsatellite markers showed normal PIC value distributions, with a peak at 0.4–0.5; the most frequent number of alleles per marker was 2, which was the minimum number expected. The reason why two alleles per markers were most frequent was that they might include STS markers. Since the PIC calculation is based upon the number of alleles and their distribution within the examined population, different distributions of PIC and allele number suggest a uniform dispersal of most EST-derived microsatellite marker polymorphisms within soybean germplasms.Hyten et al.11 reported that the LD is highly complex in soybean and they suggested that in addition to a large number of SNP markers, soybean would require a soybean haplotype map for whole-genome association analysis, equivalent to that of the human HapMap project.29 Although development of such a map would provide a useful information platform, it would also be very cost-intensive. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the positions of marker loci on the linkage map and their PIC, and found that there were several genomic blocks in which multiple markers exhibited higher or lower PIC values. Since the markers in our present linkage map are not all distributed evenly throughout the genome, we cannot demonstrate a comprehensive structure of diversity for multiple populations of soybean. However, if PIC values are calculated for all the markers from multiple populations, our results suggest that a conventional high-density genetic linkage map may be able to substitute for as haplotype map. This would enable identification of recombination hotspots and provide information on the block-like structures of the LD.Comparative mapping has shown that numerous alterations contribute to genomic diversity among plants.30 Since soybean has a paleopolyploid genome, comparison with the genomes of other legume species can reveal the process of genome duplication and subsequent rearrangements during the evolution. We compared the genome structures of soybean and L. japonicus using 293 microsatellite markers, a 10-fold increase over the 22 DNA markers used in the previous comparison by Zhu et al.13 Our results indicated three types of linkage between the two genomes, i.e. soybean LGs that were related to a single Chr of L. japonicus and which exhibited co-linearity, soybean LGs that were related to two Chrs of L. japonicus and which exhibited limited degree of co-linearity, and soybean LGs that were related to three or four Chrs of L. japonicus and did not demonstrate any apparent co-linearity. In considering the evolution of the soybean genome, it is noteworthy that all soybean LGs related to three or four Chrs of L. japonicus (LGs C1, D1b, D2, E, G, J, and K) exhibited links with Chr 4. It has been demonstrated that polyoloidy is more than the sum of its gene duplications, since this process duplicates the members of entire regulatory networks.31Shoemaker et al.25 demonstrated the segmental duplications of the soybean genome for the following pairs of the linkage groups using homeologous RFLP markers; LG A1-LG A2, LG A2-LG E, LG B1-LG H, LG B2-LG D1a/LG D1b, LG C2-LG G, LG G-LG K, and LG L-LG N. In the present study, we confirmed the possibility of segmental duplications in the previously suggested regions by inspecting the co-linearity between the genomes of soybean and L. japonicus. Furthermore, we could detect the trances of additional duplications in the following regions; a central portion of LG O-a lower half of LG L, a central portion of LG O-a lower half of LG N, and a central portion of LG I-a lower half of LG O. In this study, we have revealed relationships between the genomes of soybean and L. japonicus and this comparison, combined with information relating to regulatory networks deduced by transcriptional profiling, may provide clues toward understand the evolutionary process of the paleopolyploid soybean genome.To date, we have accumulated a considerable amount of information and material resources for the soybean genome and the next necessary and urgent step will be to compare and combine these resources systematically. Not only will such improvements assist in our understanding of this complex genetic system, but they will provide useful information for further developments in breeding technology. In the present study, we provided new information on soybean by converting EST into DNA markers. In addition to providing positional information on the genetic linkage map, we used PIC as an index for determining genomic diversity within the species and compared genome structures between legume species. These results demonstrate the potential of using publicly available soybean ESTs for the development of valuable resources beyond microsatellite markers and genetic linkage maps.Additional information is available online at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/soymarker/We thank Dr M.

IntroductionBioactive proteins from various microorganisms have become attractive alternative to conventional catalysts for production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates. However, the properties of the current available proteins do not always meet the criteria of the applications of interest. Directed evolution is a powerful tool for adapting the characteristics of a bioactive protein, but the selection of the evolved variants is always a bottle-neck step. Novel genes and proteins still need to be screened from a wide variety of microorganisms to meet the increasing requirements of various industrial and pharmaceutical peptide, proteins, or enzymes. Thus the current challenge is focus on the development of efficient rapid screening methods of related genes. However, classical gene cloning is a tedious and time-consuming work which usually requires constructing and screening a library, and delicate work often does not assure successful cloning. Required steps often include probe labeling, suitable restriction digestion, and Southern hybridization followed by construction and screening of a library.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been employed to amplify DNA fragments for molecular cloning, and is especially useful in cDNA cloning using reverse transcriptance PCR (RT–PCR). The core point of PCR technique is that the sequences for short oligonucleotide primers annealing must be available for DNA polymerization. In most cases, a problem arises from the shortage of information when using PCR technique to clone a new gene or desired DNA fragment, because the sequence at the other end of the target DNA is unknown. The success of RT–PCR relies on a universal primer complementary to the polyA tails of mRNA, which is combined with a specific primer of the known sequence. PCR techniques employing various methods to yield efficient universal primers for chromosome walking on an unknown DNA segment are classified into three types: inverse PCR, 1–4 ligation-mediate PCR, 5–17 and random primer PCR. 18–25 In general, the current PCR technique for chromosome walking suffers from these limitations: (i) they either face the high-complexity of whole genomes and require delicate manipulations, or (ii) give contaminated products, and (iii) few of them are actually suitable for new gene cloning using degenerated primers based on amino acid sequence or conserved gene locus. Thus, PCR methods are commonly performed in combination with the traditional cloning methods, such as library construction, probe labeling, Southern hybridization, and so on. We report here a simplified and effective PCR method, restriction site-dependent PCR (RSD-PCR), which used the natural restriction sites in the genomic DNA to design universal primers, and was applied with a two-round PCR protocol without nested process. The RSD-PCR protocols were optimized, and successfully used for chromosome walking and new gene cloning via degenerated primers.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultivation and genomic DNA isolation Chromosomal DNA of Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200, Thermotoga maritima , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe YHL6403 was gifts from Dr J. Wiegel and Dr M. Adams (University of Georgia, USA) and Dr Ying Huang (Nanjing Normal University, China). Bacillus pumilus ARA was isolated in the laboratory, and grown at 50°C on liquid medium containing (w/v): 1.5% xylan; 0.3% K 2 HPO 4 ; 0.2% yeast extract. Escherichia coli JM109 and their recombinants were routinely grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C. Plasmids or DNA fragments were isolated from E. coli cells or agarose gels with QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit, or QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, respectively. 2.2. Obtaining an amino acid sequence of a novel arabinosidase Arabinosidase activity was measured with standard procedure at 60°C. 26 Protein concentration was assayed by Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard, an arabinosidase was partially purified by (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel, Butyl HIC, and HW-55F-toyopearl chromatography (Sigma). The protein of main band in native gradient gel exhibiting arabinosidase activity was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane by electro-blotting for NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequencing (GeneCore Company, Shanghai, China). 2.3. Design of a RSD-PCR protocol and a group of RSD primers To reduce non-specific amplifications, the RSD-PCR protocol was designed in two rounds. In the first round (1st round), the single strand target gene from genomic DNA was amplified by single specific primer under stringent conditions. PCR mixture of 1st round in 50 times dilution was used as the template in the second round (2nd round). Then, double strand target gene was amplified by a universal primer and the specific primer in this round (Fig.  1 ). The Tm in the experiment was estimated by using formula Tm = 4 × (G + C) + 2 × (A + T). Schematic outline of RSD-PCR protocol for new gene cloning from chromosome DNA. In the round 1, the target template is amplified under stringent conditions from genomic DNA by using a specific primer which can be degenerated. In the round 2, the double strand target gene is amplified by using the same specific primer and one of the universal RSD-primers which can anneal with the corresponding restriction sites (RS) disperse in the target template.Schematic outline of RSD-PCR protocol for new gene cloning from chromosome DNA. In the round 1, the target template is amplified under stringent conditions from genomic DNA by using a specific primer which can be degenerated. In the round 2, the double strand target gene is amplified by using the same specific primer and one of the universal RSD-primers which can anneal with the corresponding restriction sites (RS) disperse in the target template. The universal primers were a group of RSD-primers designed on the basis of the restriction sites commonly used at multiple cloning sites in vectors, which contained a 3′-end complementary to six bases of a selected restriction site, and a 5′-end of degenerated nucleotide sequences for pairing with variable bases to support the anneal of the primer to its template. To lower the melting temperature of primer-dimers, proper numbers of complementary bases at the 5′-end of RSD-primers were removed from the highly degenerated bases to make sure that at least three bases were not complementary at each end of a primer-dimer (Table  1 ). Presently, no formula has been found able to help this kind of primer design because the sequences for restriction enzymes are different. The primers in Table  1 were designed manually by pairing the sequence of a primer in antiparallel orientation at all possible positions from two bases protruding at 5′-end to two bases protruding at 3′-end, and removing those base(s) from the first 3 Ns at 5′-end to make three uncomplimentary bases including protrusions at each end. In this way, the melting temperature of a primer-dimer should be at least 8°C lower than that of a template-primer hybrid when there is any G or C in the restriction site (G or C stands for 4°C, A or T stands for 2°C), so that most of the primer-dimers will be denatured at the stringent annealing temperature during PCR. Primer sequences in gene cloningPrimer sequences in gene cloning2.4. Performance and optimization of RSD-PCR The acetate kinase gene ak of T. maritima was employed as a sample gene to optimize the RSD-PCR protocol. A gene-specific primer AK complementary to a region near the stop codon of acetate kinase gene ( ak ) was designed based on the NCBI online sequence (accession no. NC_000853) (Table  1 ). In the 1st round PCR of 40 cycles, the 50 µL ex Taq -DNA polymerase buffer contained 1.25 U ex Taq -DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP. Different amount of genomic DNA templates were tested, and optimal annealing temperature in the first round ( Ta1st ) was also determined for the best resolution. In the 2nd round, PCR conditions were optimized over the concentration of RSD-primer, the annealing temperature in the second round ( Ta2nd ), and the amount of the single strand template amplified in the 1st round PCR. The optimized RSD-PCR cycling conditions on PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research) was performed as follows: 40 cycles (94°C, 30 s; 54°C, 30 s; 72°C, 2 min) for the first round of PCR, and 35 cycles (94°C, 30 s; 48°C, 30 s; 72°C, 2 min) for the second round of PCR.  The PCR products were partitioned by electrophoresis on agrose gel with DNA markers (TaKaRa). DNA fragments in single bands were isolated from agrose gel, ligated into pMD19T (TaKaRa), and transformed into E. coli JM109 competent cells by electroporation using GenePulser Xcell (Bio-Rad). Positive clones were selected on LB-ampicillin (100 µg mL −1 ) plates, and confirmed by colony PCR employing M13 forward and reverse primers (Table  1 ). To determine the sequences of inserted DNA, the recombinant plasmids were isolated from the clones, and sequenced by dideoxy-chain termination method at Invitrogen Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 2.5. Selective amplification from degenerated specific primers To clone the new arabinosidase gene from B. pumilus ARA, degenerated primers were synthesized based on the NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence. In order to compare the specificity of amplification caused by the degeneration at the 3rd base from 3′-end, three oligonucleotides were synthesized as primers annealing to the complementary sequence of the gene deduced from amino acid sequence NGTVKV, which were designated as araN1, araN2, and araN3 (Table  1 ). In the 1st round PCR (50 µL), 0.2 µM degenerated araN1, araN2, or 0.4 µM araN3 was used in the corresponding reaction; and in the 2nd round PCR, 4 µM araN1, araN2, or 8 µM araN3 was used.

Chromosome walking by RSD-PCR To find the promoter for the newly cloned arabinosidase gene, abfB of B. pumilus ARA, the specific upstream walking primer ara-up located ∼108 bp downstream the start codon was designed (Table  1 ) based on partial sequence. To locate the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene ( adhB ) in T. ethanolicus JW200, specific primers adh-N and adh-C (Table  1 ) were designed based on the sequence adhB of T. psedoethanolicus 39E (accession no. U49975). Eco RI and Xho I restriction sites were introduced in each primer, respectively, for convenient cloning into expression vector pET20b for sequencing. According to the internal sequence obtained from cloned gene fragment, the walking primers adh-up and adh-down were designed (Table  1 ). To test the RSD-PCR protocol over the eukaryotes, a gene-specific primer CUT (Table  1 ) near the start codon of acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene ( cut6 ) in S. pombe was designed based on the NCBI online sequence (accession no. Z99261). 3. Results and discussion3.1. Designing and optimizing the RSD-PCR protocol The RSD-PCR protocol included the following steps: (i) design and synthesize a specific primer and a set of universal RSD-primers; (ii) amplify the target template from genomic DNA by using a specific primer which can be degenerated; and (iii) amplify the target gene from the diluted template by the specific primer and one of the universal primers (Fig.  1 ).  Before the RSD-primers in Table  1 were designed, another universal inosine-primer was tested, and the results indicated that 11 pares between inosine bases and nucleotide bases were not sufficient to support the annealing of the primer for amplification. Amplification occurred between the same specific primers when using the inosine-primer to clone a gene encoding the most abundant excellular protein from straw mushroom. This may because that the Tm value of the inosine-primer was too low for annealing at the anneal temperature, or polymerizing at the elongation temperature. The same fragments were amplified even after the annealing and the elongation temperatures were lowed down to 38°C and 60°C using Z Taq -DNA polymerase (Takara) (data not shown). The RSD-primers were thus designed and proved useful in RSD-PCR when combined with a specific primer to amplify new DNA fragments. The parameters were further optimized with cloning of the published ak from T. maritima as an example. Fragments of ∼1.7 and 2.7 kb were amplified by AK and the RSD-primers: Nco-dep and EcoR-dep (Fig.  2 A-a and b), respectively, whereas ∼0.3 and 1 kb were yielded from Hind-dep (Fig.  2 A-c). Five PCR parameters were tested for RSD-PCR protocol, and the best results were archived from: (i) 500 ng per 50 µL reaction mixture of T. maritima genomic DNA in the 1st round PCR for target template amplification (Fig.  2 A, lane 1–3); (ii) 10°C above Tm for Ta1st (Fig.  2 A, lane 4–7); (iii) 20 to 50 dilution times of target template (data not shown); (iv) 40°C to 48°C of Ta2nd (Fig.  2 A, lane 8–10); and (v) 4 µM or higher RSD-primer concentration was required in the 2nd round PCR (Fig.  2 A, lane 11–14).  The designated fragments in Fig.  2 A were cloned and sequenced, proving the same sequence as the target genes published online (accession no. NC_000853). However, EcoR-dep primer annealed to the Eco RI (GAATTC) similar site GAACTC in the target gene, whereas the other RSD-primers annealed to the corresponding restriction sites (Fig.  3 ). By using RSD-PCR protocol, cut6 was amplified from a eukaryote genome of S. pombe by the specific primer CUT6 and a universal primer Hind-dep, EcoR-dep, or Kpn-dep (Fig.  2 B-a). The sequencing results of the three bands showed that every PCR fragment sequence was consistent with online published sequence (accession no. Z99261), and RSD-primers annealed to the corresponding restriction sites (Fig.  3 ). The sequenced fragments amplified by RSD-primers and the genomic templates. One clone from each primer set was picked out for sequencing.The sequenced fragments amplified by RSD-primers and the genomic templates. One clone from each primer set was picked out for sequencing.3.2. Cloning a new gene using degenerated primers The 15 NH 2 -terminal amino acids sequence was MNGTVKVNENIGRIS- for the purified arabinosidase of B. pumilus ARA. The degenerated primers were designed based on NGTVKV (Table  1 , araN1, araN2, and araN3), and the occurrence of degeneration at 3rd base from 3′ terminus was a key point for obtaining specific amplifications (Fig.  2 B-b). When this position was not degenerated, the primer with a matched 3rd base (araN1) yielded the fragment of only one size (Fig.  2 B-b, lane 4), and the primer with a mismatched 3rd base (araN2) yielded kinds of non-target fragments (Fig.  2 B-b, lane 5); and when the primer containing both matched and mismatched 3rd bases (araN3), the PCR products showed all the contaminants (Fig.  2 B-b, lane 6). The same phenomenon was observed when we clone a new gene from straw mushroom (data not shown). The fragments amplified by araN1 and Pst-dep in a single band (Fig.  2 B-b, lane 4) was then sequenced, which approved to be a potential arabinosidase gene best homologous to the abfB from B. substilus 168 of 67% identity by NCBI Blast analysis. The specific upwalking primer ara-up was then designed based on the sequence of cloned similar abfB above. The main fragment of 0.5 kb amplified by ara-up and Hind-dep (Fig.  2 B-b, lane 7) from B. pumilus ARA was cloned for sequencing, and thus the complete similar abfB and the regutory nucleotide sequence of 2.2 kb fragment was obtained (accession no. DQ324528). 3.3. Studying the gene structure around adhB in T. ethanolicus JW200 A 1.2 kb adhB gene was amplified from genomic DNA of T. ethanolicus JW200 by using primer adh-N and adh-C. On the basis of this sequence, the walking primers adh-up and adh-down were designed for cloning the flanking genes by RDS-PCR. The upstream walking product of 0.5 kb amplified by adh-up and EcoR-dep (Fig.  2 B-c, lane 8) and downstream walking product of 0.9 kb amplified by adh-down and Nco-dep (Fig.  2 B-c, lane 9) were cloned for sequencing, respectively. The potential promoter of adhB was identified 70–100 bp upstream the RBS. A truncated ORF upstream of but in the opposite orientation relative to adhB was translated into a polypeptide with amino acid sequence of 93% and 76% of identity with the N -acetylglutamate-gamma-semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( argC ) of T. psedoethanolicus 39E and T. tengcongensis MB4. Further upstream walking was done by the RSD-PCR to obtain the complete ORF of argC. From downstream sequence, a truncated ORF identical to a similar polypeptide 2-polyprenylphenol hydroxylase and related flavodoxin oxidoreductases located downstream of T. psedoethanolicus 39E and T. tengcongensis MB4 adhB gene was found. Thus, the complete ORF of adhB and upstream argC , and a truncated downstream gene sequence of 3 kb from T. ethanolicus JW200 chromosomal DNA was obtained (accession no. DQ323135), and the gene structures were compared among these species in genus Thermoanaerobacter (Fig.  4 ).

Universal primers emerged from degenerated primers Other than trying to reduce the degeneration according to the statistical reports about the codon usage in certain species, there is no direct evidence to indicate how to design a degenerated primer based on a few amino acid residues. The difference in the specificity of PCR amplifications by the generated primers for the arabinosidase gene showed that araN3, a mixture of complementary and non-complementary 3rd base from the 3′-end, would change PCR format rather than produce the mixed fragments from araN1 and araN2 (Fig.  2 B-b, lanes 4–6). This result not only indicated the necessity to avoid degeneration in the last five bases at 3′-end of a specific primer, but also suggests that five or more complementary bases at 3′-end followed by a degenerated sequence facilitated selection for relatively specific amplifications. Accordingly, the universal primers were designed as RSD-primers using six nucleotides (nt) recognized by a restriction enzyme and 11 degenerated bases, in which we thought that the addition of more degenerated bases could reduce the specificity. Theoretically, the G/C rich restriction sites are better choices for this purpose, although Hin dIII and Eco RI sites worked well in this work. The 3′-end can be any 5–8 bases without degeneration, but 6 nt restriction sites are easily recognized, whereas 4 nt restriction sites may occur too frequently in genomes to limit walking length. Thus, the specific primers were designed of the Tm ranged from 42°C to 48°C to pair with universal primers. Primers of higher Tm yielded contaminated PCR products when performed in the ideal annealing temperature based on universal primers which was 40 ∼ 48°C as Fig.  2 A, lane 8–10 indicated (data not shown). The uncertainness in the amplifications by using RSD-PCR protocol was mainly caused by the removal of some purine and pyrimidine bases from the degenerated 5′-end of RSD-primers because these removed bases might be complementary to the unknown end. It was necessary to lower the melting temperature of primer-dimers in this way because the binding of inosine to the regular bases gave insufficient strength to support annealing. 3.5. Overall strategy of RSD-PCR RSD-PCR strategy is based on these principles: (i) restriction sites disperse throughout the genomes of double strand DNA either in prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms are natural candidacy for universal pairing; (ii) a universal primer can be a combination of a 3′-end pairing with the bases of selected restriction sites in genomic DNA, and a 5′-end of degenerated sequence to support annealing; and (iii) to limit non-specific amplifications, genomic DNA can be greatly diluted after the target template is amplified by a specific primer. Thus, two-round PCR amplifications were employed in the RSD-PCR protocol: amplify the target template from genomic DNA in the 1st round PCR by using a specific primer to accumulate the specific single strand template; and amplify the target gene in the 2nd round by using the specific primer and one of the universal primers. The protocol is especially useful in new gene cloning using a degenerate primer based on the amino acids sequence or conserved region without nested PCR, traditional library construction and screening process. Except for the genes listed in the article, RSD-PCR has been successfully applied in chromosome walking in Candida sp., Bacillus sp., and Alcaligenes sp. However, difficulties were found in cloning the new genes from the chromosome DNA of straw mushroom by RSD-PCR as well as cloning cDNA by RT–PCR, which might be caused by the complexity of the organism. Two-round PCR was previously reported, which enriched single-stranded DNA sequences either upstream or downstream from the known sequences before second round amplification. 20 This method increased final specificity, but the following random primer amplification still created non-target molecules. Thus, more PCR methods for gene walking were later reported using nested amplification to increase specificity. 19 , 21 , 253.6. The practical performance of the RSD-PCR protocol The specificity of the final products was strongly controlled by the first single strand amplification. Although a standard PCR can yield specific products with a Ta range of 10 ∼ 15°C, 27 the Ta1st in RSD-PCR was recommended for ∼10°C above Tm . The amount of chromosome DNA depended on the genome size of the organism, and ∼0.5 and 3 µg was recommended for bacteria and yeasts. Meanwhile, the specific primer without degeneration should be reduced to one-tenth of the normal concentration (0.02 µM) because it was a non-exponential amplification, but the concentration of degenerated specific primer should be varied with the degeneracy, e.g. 0.2 µM of degenerated specific primer yielded positive results in the cloning of abfB from B. pumilus ARA (Fig.  2 B-b).  In the 2nd round PCR, there are three factors that need to be dealt with: (i) the existence of restriction sites in the single strand templates, (ii) the unknown sequence around the restriction sites, and (iii) the property of the specific primer. Because the target template from the 1st round is a new sequence, we do not know which restriction sites are at a suitable distance for second round amplification, a set of RSD-primers were synthesized, and each was performed with the specific primer for locating the target gene. Meanwhile, the number of matched bases in the region paired by the degenerated part of an RSD-primer is not predictable, and the binding between RSD-primer and chromosome DNA varies from time to time. This can explain why the effects of the primer concentration and annealing temperature varied with the type of RSD-primer used in amplification of ak from T. maritima (Fig.  2 A). From the sequences of the cloned fragments, we can see that mismatches frequently occur in the 5′-end, and occasionally occur in the restriction site at 3′-end of RSD-primer (Fig.  3 , TME). However, these mismatches did not affect amplification efficiency, indicating the importance of the specific primer in the selectivity of the amplification. The strength and specificity of the amplifications depend on the property of the specific primer. When the specific primer is not sufficiently unique, it can anneal to undesired site(s), and give several possibilities, among which the acceptable result is the single primer amplification as previously reported, 28 and a clear mixture of single and double primer amplifications as shown in Fig.  2 B-a ( S. pombe ). In a few cases, a specific primer annealed to wrong site(s) instead of the target DNA resulting in non-target products (data not shown), and a new primer should be synthesized in the case. 3.7. Identification of the target gene from the PCR products A stem-loop structure is occasionally formed following every cycle by single primer amplification products, because of the inverted terminal repeats (Fig.  1 ). Stem-loop structures are more stable than the primer-template hybrid, and therefore suppress exponential amplification. 16 , 17 However, single primer amplification product still occurred in cut6 amplification from S. pombe as shown in Fig.  2 B-a, the largest fragments of the same length in lanes 1–3 as PCR products amplified by single primer CUT (lane 0). This non-target molecule amplification was greatly inhibited by decrease of annealing temperature to 42°C (data not shown). The reason for this is the equilibrium between productive PCR primer annealing and non-productive self-annealing of the fragment's complementary ends, which arises within each PCR cycle at the primer annealing stage. 29 This critical temperature differs from the templates and specific primers. However, in most cases, the same size fragments appeared in different RSD-primer amplifications are treated as PCR backgrounds of non-target molecules. They can be easily distinguished from target fragments which usually present different sizes of different RSD-primer amplification (Fig.  2 B-a). The main RSD-PCR product amplified by AK and Nco-dep only yielded one of the two calculated fragments of 1.6 kb (Figs  2 A-a and 3), and a putative 0.6 kb fragment was missing, which may be because of ex Taq DNA polymerase amplification preference of length (Takara Bio Catalog) and RSD-primer anneal preference at the annealing temperature based on the template and primer sequences. 3.8. Advantages and applications of RSD-PCR RSD-PCR has the advantages as follows: (i) chromosomal DNA is directly used as template in the 1st round PCR, and thus some inefficient steps such as digestion, and ligation are avoided; (ii) the amplification and the dilution of the single strand target template in the 1st round reduce the disturbance of non-target DNA, and makes it possible to employ a universal primer to the unknown end; (iii) the stringent conditions for both the 1st and the 2nd round PCR reduces the non-specific annealing of the primers to chromosomal DNA, and thus strongly controls the specificity of the amplifications; (vi) the RSD-PCR protocol does not need nested PCR selection, and becomes a useful technique for gene walking using degenerated primers based on NH 2 -terminal or conserved amino acids sequences. RSD-PCR can be applied in the molecular cloning of (i) new genes from degenerated primers derived from NH 2 -terminal amino acids sequences of proteins, or from conserved amino acids sequences in various enzymes; (ii) signal peptide or propeptide genes for secretory proteins or mature proteins; (iii) regulatory sequence of a gene or gene cluster; (iv) the full sequences of operons or their neighboring genes.
