Complete nucleotide sequences of both plasmids have been determined, and the putative functions of the encoded proteins and the cis -acting DNA sequences have been analyzed. pO157 shares strikingly similar genes and DNA sequences with F-factor and the transmissible drug-resistant plasmid R100 for DNA replication, copy number control, plasmid segregation, conjugative functions and stable maintenance in the host, although it is defective in DNA transfer by conjugation due to the truncation and deletion of the required genes and DNA sequences. In addition, it encodes several proteins implicated in EHEC pathogenicity such as an EHEC hemolysin (HlyA), a catalase-peroxidase (KatP), a serine protease (EspP) and type II secretion system. pOSAK1 possesses a ColE1-like replication system, and the DNA sequence is extremely similar to that of a drug-resistant plasmid, NTP16, derived from Salmonella typhimurium except that it lacks drug resistance transposons.

The formation of multimers has been observed in a derivative of pKYM which lost a part of the origin region, and the loss of the monomerization mechanism would have led to these multimers. By analyzing the constructs of several mutants, we discovered that a DNA region required for monomerization was present upstream of the RepK binding site in the replication origin. As either of the T-rich sequence or the inverted repeat sequences which were seen in that region have been lost in the multimer-forming plasmids, these sequences may be necessary for monomerization.

Instead of segregating progenies, conventional lines sharing the same trait were bulked by the BLA method. This method is an alternative approach to the identification of DNA markers linked with a target gene. A major advantage of this method is time-saving for genetic stock development. The advantage is very significant for organisms having a long generation period. This method has been tested by using fertility restoration of rice cytoplasmic male sterility of wild abortive type as a target trait. A fertility-restoring gene was successfully identified by linkage with RFLP markers. This gene was mapped in the middle of the long arm of chromosome 10 of the rice genome.","A method, bulked line analysis (BLA), was developed for identification of the RFLP markers associated with a target gene.

Plasmid libraries were generated from 11 of these BAC and P1 clones, and 614 random plasmid clones were sequenced for a total of about 200 kb.

Characterization of its complementary DNA revealed that the gene encodes two isoforms by alternative splicing, SOD4-1 and SOD4-2 which differ in their C-terminal exons. Their predicted amino acid sequences include a consensus signal peptide at their N-termini and are homologous to the extracellular-types of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase in mammals. In addition, SOD4-2 possesses a putative transmembrane domain at the C-terminal region. When transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, both types were found in the membranes and SOD4-1 also in the culture fluid. It is, therefore, indicated that SOD4-1 is an extracellular form and SOD4-2 a membrane-bound form, the latter representing a novel type of SOD. In C. elegans , SOD4-2 mRNA was found to be preferentially expressed in eggs. "," We have identified a novel Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (termed SOD-4) in Caenorhabditis elegans .

The sequencing of these clones revealed that the average size of the cDNA inserts and of their open reading frames was 5.3 kb and 2.8 kb (930 amino acid residues), respectively. Homology search against public databases indicated that the predicted coding sequences of 86 clones exhibited significant similarities to known genes; 51 of them (59%) were related to those for cell signaling/communication, nucleic acid management, and cell structure/motility.
