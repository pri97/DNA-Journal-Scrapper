IntroductionChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the only cultivated species in the genus Cicer. This is the fourth important legume crop after soybean (Glycine max), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and common pea (Pisum sativum). According to the seed morphology, chickpea is of two types; desi type with small dark brown seeds and kabuli with bold pale brown seeds. Recently, draft genome assemblies of both the chickpea types have been reported.1–3 Chickpea was domesticated with wheat, barley, peas and lentil as a member of West Asian Neolithic crops during the origin of agriculture around 10,000 years ago with the oldest archaeological evidence from 7500 B.C.4,5 The annual species C. reticulatum L. is considered to be the wild progenitor of the cultivated chickpea and both the species are interfertile, suggesting the wild as the primary gene pool of the cultigen. C. echinospermum D. is considered as the secondary gene pool and is crossable with both the wild progenitor and the cultivated chickpea, but shows a strong barrier to genic flux and the hybrids tend to be sterile. The other annual Cicer species may form the tertiary gene pool.6 In contrast to the wild progenitors of other Neolithic crops, C. reticulatum shows a narrow eco-geographic distribution indicating its limited adaptive variation, which caused the first bottleneck of genetic base of cultivated chickpea.4 Domestication of many crops occurred with a limited number of founding genotypes followed by subsequent selection. Selection of phenotypes included loss of dormancy, reduced pod dehiscence, larger plant and seed size with more erect habit (Fig. 1). However, the key feature of chickpea domestication was the change in the cropping season. While most of the crops with West Asian origin are autumn-sown, chickpea was transformed from an autumn-sown crop to a spring-sown crop to avoid Ascochyta blight caused by the fungus Ascochyta rabiei.7 This change in cropping season resulted in the separation of the reproductive phases of the cultivated species and the wild progenitor and caused another bottleneck in the genetic base. The major genetic difference that was selected for the change in cropping season was the loss of response to vernalization in the cultivated species.8Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideImages of field-grown wild (C. reticulatum L.)

The colour version of the figure is available online.Domestication process of most of the crops focused on improved yield, product size and organoleptic quality, however, tolerance to abiotic stresses and pathogen infection were compromised in this process. Naturally occurring resistant alleles in the wild relatives of the cultivated crops are an underexploited resource for plant breeding and can be introgressed into the elite cultivated genotypes to improve agricultural performance.9 Wild relatives are the vital source of higher natural allelic diversity, particularly for the improvement of cultivated crops with narrow genetic bases. They are also important for construction of high-density inter-specific genetic linkage maps and mapping of genes/QTLs (quantitative trait loci) governing agronomically important traits because of higher genomic polymorphism. Previously, genomes of the wild progenitors of some cultivated legume crops have been sequenced to decipher the genetic constitution of coding and non-coding components of their genomes and the process of domestication.10,11 An interspecies mapping population, generated by crossing a chickpea cultivar ICC4958 and its wild progenitor C. reticulatum PI489777, is being widely used as a reference to construct high-resolution genetic linkage maps for identification and mapping of genes/QTLs especially controlling important abiotic/biotic stress tolerance and domestication traits.12–15 Here, we report a draft genome assembly of the wild progenitor of cultivated chickpea C. reticulatum L. PI489777. Comparative analysis of wild and cultivated chickpea genome assemblies and the genomic resources would accelerate the understanding of molecular basis of selection during the domestication process and genetic enhancement of chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing and assemblyCicerreticulatum L. (accession PI489777) plants were grown in the plant growth chamber under controlled condition for 4 weeks before harvesting the fresh leaves for isolating genomic DNA using DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Cat no. 68163, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s protocol. The sequence data was generated by Illumina HiSeq1000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two individual whole genome shotgun (WGS) libraries with average insert size 180 base pair (bp), one WGS library with average insert size 500 bp and one mate-pair (MP) library each of 3,000 and 10,000 bp average insert sizes were prepared and sequenced in 100 baseX2 paired-end (PE) format following manufacturer’s protocol for the assembly. The raw sequence reads were filtered using NGS toolkit with default parameter for obtaining high-quality reads.16 Filtered reads were assembled by three tools namely, SOAPdenovo2, MaSuRCA and ALLPATHS-LG using a 512 GB RAM and 48 core server.17–19 Finally, the best assembly with ALLPATHS-LG version SL 2.0 with ploidy 2 and default parameters was used for analysis. The minimum scaffold size was kept as 1 kb. Scaffolds were ordered in the linkage groups following the marker sequences of a linkage map constructed using a bi-parental RIL (recombinant inbred line) mapping population (C. arietinum acc. ICC 4958 x C. reticulatum acc. PI 489777).20 The gaps of unknown sizes were joined with 100 N as per National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) guideline. Transcriptome coverage in the genome assembly was verified using BLAT.21 The assembly was submitted to NCBI under the Bioproject PRJNA263699. The sequence reads were submitted to the short read archive (SRA) of NCBI under the IDs SRR160365, SRR1640444, SRR1640451 and SRR1640455. Reference-based genome assemblies were generated by mapping the C. reticulatum WGS reads on ICC4958 (desi) and CDC Frontier (kabuli) genome assemblies using bwa mapping tool with default parameter and producing consensus sequence.1,3,222.2. Gene annotationGene annotation was performed following the pipeline described previously. Briefly, repeat sequences were identified and masked by the software packages REPEATMODELLER, PILER, REPEATSCOUT, LTR_FINDER REPEATMASKER (http://repeatmasker.org) and REPEATPROTEIN MASK.23–26 Repeat-masked assembly was used for annotating protein-coding genes by ab initio, homology-based and EST-based approaches. Augustus and GENESCAN tools trained with Arabidopsis data were used for ab initio prediction. EXONERATE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/) and PASA27 tools were used for the homology-based and EST-based annotations, respectively, using predicted proteome sequences of desi and kabuli chickpeas1,2 and assembled transcriptome of C. reticulatum.28 Outputs from these three approaches were integrated by EVIDENCEMODELLER (EVM)29 to generate consensus gene sets and the EVM output was run through PASA for prediction of spliced variants and various elements like untranslated regions. Filtering parameters of minimum coding sequence (CDS) of 150 base pairs (bp) and low N-content (<10%) were applied to arrive at the final predicted gene set. To resolve annotation differences between the orthologous gene pairs of wild and cultivated chickpeas during comparative analysis, corresponding gene sequences of both the genotypes were re-annotated using Augustus only for a better comparison. Gene annotation of the reference-based assembly was done by following the annotation files of the corresponding assemblies.For functional annotation, the predicted protein sequences were searched with various databases such as, ntdb of NCBI, TrEMBL, UniRef100, SwissProt, TAIR and KEGG with cut off E value 1e-5. Resistance gene homologues (RGH) were identified following a previously described method.3 Briefly, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles were created for different R gene families using sequences present in the plant resistance gene database. These HMM profiles were used to identify the primary RGH set. These sequences were further screened for the presence of specific RGH-protein domains using InterPro scan and a search in the NCBI conserved domain database.2.3. Mining of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletionsSequence reads were filtered with NGS tool kit.16 Filtered reads were mapped on the reference sequences using bwa mapping tool. Only uniquely mapped reads were considered for further analysis. The sam files were converted to bam files using samtools, and then to vcf format to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions (InDels). High quality SNPs were identified using only unique non-reference alleles supported by five or more reads (in case of C. reticulatum WGS reads) and/or three or more reads (in case of restriction-associated genotyping-by-sequencing reads). SNPs on pseudomolecules of eight linkage groups were plotted and visualized by Circos.30 Reference-based genome assemblies, reference-based gene annotation and the vcf files of the SNPs/InDels are curated at the website nipgr.res.in/WCGAP/.2.4. Pair-wise comparison of genomes and genesGene cluster analysis was performed by all-against-all BLASTP search of the proteomes of all the concerned plants followed by orthoMCL.31 Pair-wise sequence comparison between the pseudomolecules of wild and cultivated chickpea was performed using default parameters of SyMap v4.0.32 The whole genome dot plot with eight linkage groups of wild and desi chickpeas was generated by selecting hits with >90% identity. Inter-species gene order colinearity was detected by MCScanX33 with default parameter considering BLASTP =1e-5. Orthologous genes between the wild and cultivated chickpea were identified by BLASTP. Links of collinear gene blocks between the pseudomolecules of two species were shown by dual synteny or circle plot. Protein sequences of orthologous gene-pairs were aligned by ClustalW34. The output file and CDS sequences of the corresponding genes were used to determine synonymous substitution rate (Ks) by PAL2NAL and CODEML in PAML4.5.35,36 Species divergence was calculated using the equation T = Ks/2r. The value of r was taken as 6.1 × 10 - 9 per year.372.5. Diversity analysisStacks pipeline was used to build loci for restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequence reads.38 The SNP-based genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among cultivated and wild chickpea accessions were determined using cladogram interface of TASSEL5.0 (http://www.maizegenetics.net/#!tassel/c17q9). For assessment of population structure among chickpea accessions, the SNP genotyping data were analyzed in STRUCTURE following the methods of Kujur et al.39 For determining nucleotide diversity in the intergenic regions, 2 kb up- and downstream regions of gene sequences according to direction of their annotation in the genome were considered. Significance analysis was performed by Wilcoxon rank sum test and paired t-test using R stats package (https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html).3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyWe prepared 3 paired-end libraries; 2 with 180 bp and 1 with 500 bp insert sizes, along with 2 mate-pair (MP) libraries with 3 kb and 10 kb insert sizes and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq1000 platform to generate 100 × 2 bp short sequence reads. The filtered high quality 1,198,234,588 reads (~119 Gb) (Supplementary Table S1) were used for de novo assembly using ALLPATHS-LG, SOAPdenovo2 and MaSuRCA. ALLPATHS-LG produced a better output in comparison to other assembly tools in terms of number and lengths of the scaffolds, generating total scaffold length of 416,562,993 bp at 49X estimated genome coverage (Supplementary Table S2). ALLPATHS-LG predicted an estimated genome size of 817.64 Mb at k-mer 25 and 63% of the genome was estimated to be repetitive, while distribution frequency of k-mer 17 by Jellyfish predicted an estimated genome size of 802.003 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1)40. The assembly tool generated total 7,383 scaffolds with N50 and average sizes of 216.8 and 56.534 kb, respectively, from 35,261 contigs with N50 and minimum sizes of 23.2 and 1 kb, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Seventeen small scaffolds showing significant similarity with bacterial genome sequences were removed by us and NCBI. Approximately 1,651 scaffolds were anchored to eight linkage groups (LGs) using marker sequences of a linkage map constructed using a RIL mapping population of C. arietinum ICC4958 X C. reticulatum PI48977718 to generate eight pseudomolecules of total 327.07 Mb (Supplementary Table S4) within the total assembly of 416,658,930 bp distributed in 5,723 fragments. N50 length of the whole assembly was 39.84 Mb and the largest assembled pseudomolecule was LG6 with 58.23 Mb in length (Supplementary Table S5). Out of 1,651 anchored scaffolds, 1,081 scaffolds (~65%) covering 283.74 Mb (86.77% of total pseudomolecule length) were oriented. Less than 1,000 fragments contributed to more than 90% of the assembly (Supplementary Fig. S2). Approximately 74.64 and 48.33% reads of WGS and MP libraries, respectively, were mapped back and covered the whole genome assembly (Supplementary Table S6). Paired reads of the 3 and 10 kb MP libraries were mapped to the average distances of 2662 ± 496 bp and 9002 ± 1226 bp, respectively, as a validation of the assembly. Mapping of an earlier reported transcriptome assembly of C. reticulatum28 showed alignment of 90.74% (33,815 of 37,265 tentative contigs) assembled transcript on the genome assembly with =90% identity with =80% coverage. About 97% (1,136,248 of 1,171,453 reads) of high-quality transcriptome sequence reads could be mapped on the genome assembly. Core eukaryotic genes mapping approach (CEGMA)41 analysis was able to map 319 (~70%) of total 458 core eukaryotic genes with full coverage and 426 (~93%) genes with more than 90% coverage and E-value 1e-10. Both these data suggested that more than 90% of C. reticulatum gene space has been covered in the present genome assembly. For a better comparative analysis with the available chickpea genome assemblies,1,3 sequence reads of C. reticulatum were mapped on both the chickpea genome assemblies and two reference-based consensus genome assemblies of C. reticulatum were produced. The chickpea var. ICC4958 (desi) reference-based assembly was of 440,184,772 bp and the same for chickpea var. CDC Frontier (kabuli) was of 421,850,125 bp in lengths (Supplementary Table S7). Polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) between the wild and two domesticated chickpea draft assemblies and the flanking sequences were listed (Supplementary Table S8) as a resource for developing genetic markers. Salient features of the assembly are mentioned in Table 1. Assembly and annotation statistics of C. reticulatum genomeAssembly and annotation statistics of C. reticulatum genome3.2. Genome annotation and comparative analysis of protein-coding genesUsing repeat-masked assembly, the protein-coding genes were predicted by three approaches (ab initio, homology-based and EST-based), followed by generating a high confidence non-redundant set of consensus genes by merging their results. A total of 25,680 non-redundant consensus genes spanning 85.786 Mb with a gene density of 6.1 genes per 100 kb was predicted. A sum of 666 genes was predicted to have average 2.08 transcript isoforms resulting in total 26,404 protein coding DNA sequences (CDS). Average gene length was 3.34 kb with 5.76 exons per gene and the total CDS length was 30.622 Mb with an average length 1.192 kb. A total of 22,259 genes were located on the pseudomolecules (Supplementary Table S9). Annotation of the reference-based assemblies following the annotation coordinates of the reference assemblies resulted in identification of 27,722 and 23,656 genes for ICC4958- and CDC Frontier-based assemblies. The number of predicted genes by de novo annotation was less because of less availability of wild chickpea ESTs in the public databases. The ab initio and EST-based approaches predicted 27,151 and 25,946 gene models, respectively, resulting in annotation of 25,680 high confidence consensus gene models. A clustering analysis of the de novo protein sets showed that a total of 64,904 proteins belonging to 15,068 families were shared by wild, desi (ICC4958) and kabuli (CDC Frontier) chickpeas, while 17,314 and 15,695 protein families were shared by the wild and desi, and the wild and kabuli chickpeas, respectively. A sum of 131 proteins belonging to 59 families of the wild chickpea were not shared with either desi or kabuli chickpea (Supplementary Fig. S3). Notably, 97.64% (25,075) predicted proteins displayed significant sequence similarity (=1e-5 by BLAST search) with at least one of the public protein databases analyzed (Supplementary Table S10). 15.70% (4033) of the total wild chickpea CDSs did not show any sequence variation with those of desi chickpea, while sequences of 12.02% (3209) wild chickpea CDSs were identical with those of kabuli chickpea. Approximately 83.62% (21,475) of wild chickpea CDSs showed significant sequence similarity (=90% identity with =80% coverage) with the desi chickpea CDSs in contrast to 74.65% (19,170) with kabuli chickpea CDSs. In case of protein sequence, 73.50% (18,876) and 63.46% (16,296) of predicted proteins of C. reticulatum showed significant sequence similarity (=95% identity with =80% coverage) with the predicted protein sets of desi and kabuli chickpea, respectively (Supplementary Table S11). All these observations emphasized that the desi type chickpea was closer to the wild progenitor C. reticulatum in evolution as compared to the kabuli type chickpea.3.3. Genomic featuresPutative pericentromeric region in each linkage group of C. reticulatum assembly was delineated by comparing genetic and physical distances and mapping the repeat and gene densities (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S12). Gene density in the pericentromeric region was 5.1 genes/100 kb, in contrast to 9.3 genes/100 kb in the euchromatic region. Average recombination rate in the pericentromeric region (1,921 kb/cM) was similar to that in the desi chickpea assembly (1,691 kb/cM).3 This high pericentromeric recombination rate (4,350 kb/cM in Phaseolus vulgaris) indicated less anchoring of sequence scaffolds in the pericentromeric region due to lack of markers and scarcity of longer scaffolds. Poor gene density (3.8 genes/100 kb) in the un-anchored scaffolds indicated that those mostly belonged to the pericentromeric region. C. reticulatum genome shared a substantial synteny and conservation of gene orders with the genome of the model legume Medicago truncatula (Medicago) (Fig. 2). Total 17,154 genes of Medicago and C. reticulatum existed in 849 colinear blocks of 5 or more genes. The highest synteny was observed between Medicago chromosome 1 (Mt1) and C. reticulatum LG 4 (Cr4) with 82 colinear blocks comprising of 2,037 genes, followed by the synteny between Mt3 and Cr5 with 52 blocks of 1,475 genes and between Mt2 and Cr1 with 41 blocks of 1,445 genes (Supplementary Table S13). C. reticulatum genome assembly was compared with that of the desi chickpea (ICC4958). The same genetic map was used for both the assemblies and, therefore, pseudomolecules in both the assemblies shared an overall synteny at the sequence level (Supplementary Fig. S5) and gene order level (Supplementary Fig. S6) for LGs 2, 6 and 7. The other pseudomolecules showed a few disagreements. Although, extensive local gene collinearity was observed in all the pseudomolecules, incongruity in the positions and orientations of a few gene blocks between the corresponding pseudomolecules of LG1, 3, 5 and 8 were observed. The most disagreement was observed in the upper arm of LG4. These disagreements might have resulted from relatively more dependence on the genetic map for anchoring a large number of scaffolds in case of ICC4958. Comparatively larger scaffolds were anchored in case of C. reticulatum using a fewer genetic markers and most of them are oriented.

Therefore, the resistance gene homologues (RGH) of C. reticulatum were analyzed in detail in comparison to those of the domesticated chickpea. Total 116 RGH were identified in the wild chickpea assembly following stringent criteria described previously.3 However, when the gene sequences of 133 RGH, identified in the advanced draft genome of chickpea ICC4958, were mapped on the wild chickpea genome, four more RGH were obtained (Supplementary Text S1), which were not annotated before. Three clusters of R genes were observed in the wild chickpea genome each in LG3, 5 and 6. Among all identified RGH, 22 belong to TIR-NBS-LRR and 28 belong to CC-NBS-LRR families (Supplementary Table S14). One hundred four RGH of wild chickpea were orthologous to those of ICC4958, of which coding sequences of 80 orthologous pairs were of same length including 24 identical pairs. The remaining 24 orthologous pairs showed length differences due to InDels in the exons. Experimental validation of most of their sequence was not possible due to lack of the corresponding transcript sequences in the databases. Only two of them were verified by comparing the transcript sequences (Supplementary Text S2). One of those (Cr_03218) belonged to CC-NBS family and is orthologous to Ca_03824 of ICC4958 and XM_004490520.2 of CDC Frontier and showed 69 base-deletion in the exon 3. Cr_03218 is orthologous to RGA4 known for resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.42 The other (Cr_10687) belonged to NBS-LRR family and is orthologous to Ca_09490 of ICC4958 and XM_012715315.1 of CDC Frontier showed 9 base deletion in the exon1 of the gene. Cr_10687 is orthologous to RPM1 gene, well known for conferring resistance against bacterial leaf spot caused by Pseudomonus syringae pv. maculicola.43 Of the remaining 16 genes of total 120 RGHs, 3 genes were not found in the cultivated chickpea assemblies, 3 genes showed large deletions in the wild species as compared to the corresponding genes in the cultivated species and 10 genes showed deletion in the wild chickpea assembly due to the presence of ambiguous bases (N). Total 34 RGHs are present in 9 clusters (3 or more RGH within 2 Mb) in C. reticulatum genome assembly (Fig. 3a). LG6 showed the presence of total 9 RGHs in 2 clusters. Six RGHs were found present in LG1 in a cluster. Each of LG2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 showed the presence of 1 RGH cluster. Seven of these clusters were collinear with the CDC Frontier genome assembly. Colinearity of other two clusters could not be confirmed due to the presence of the orthologous genes in unanchored scaffolds of the CDC Frontier assembly. A cluster analysis of the predicted RGHs in the wild and desi chickpea assemblies showed high sequence conservation without any outlier group (Supplementary Fig. S7). Total 54 RGH of Medicago showed colinearity with C. reticulatum RGHs (Supplementary Table S15). Orthologues of some well-known RGH, such as RGA4, TMV resistance gene N44 and powdery mildew resistance gene RPW845 can be traced comparing C. reticulatum and Medicago genomes through syntenic relationship (Supplementary Fig. S8).

A 500 kb bin size with a 50 kb sliding window and the maximum value of 1 for the Y-axis was used to plot nucleotide diversity.

The colour version of the figure is available online (desi-green line, kabuli-red line).3.5. Sequence diversity between the wild and cultivated chickpeaSequence reads of C. reticulatum PI489777 were mapped on pseudomolecules of eight assembled linkage groups of chickpea cultivars CDC Frontier and ICC4958 to analyze genome-wide distribution of SNPs and InDels (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Table S16). LG4 of both the assemblies showed the presence of the highest number of SNPs and InDels supporting the previous observation that LG4 is the most variable among all the linkage groups.1,3 The rate of synonymous substitutions (Ks) were calculated for 15,403 and 12,780 orthologous gene pairs between wild-desi and wild-kabuli, respectively, to ascertain diversification periods of the domesticated species from the wild species. The plot of Ks values against the number of gene pairs showed two peaks of diversification, one sharp peak at 0.0001 and another diffused peak around 0.006 (Fig. 3b). Similar pattern was observed when the transcriptome sequences of the domesticated and wild chickpeas were compared.46 The diffused peak around Ks 0.006 corresponds to speciation around 0.5 million years ago, while the peak at 0.0001 possibly suggests recent gene flow from the wild during the domestication process as both the wild and domesticated species are interfertile. To investigate that, SNP frequencies were compared between the intergenic regions of the orthologous gene pairs constituting these peaks. The SNP frequencies in the intergenic regions of the corresponding gene pairs of the younger peak (0.0055 bp-1) was significantly lower (P-value < 0.0001) than that of the older peak (0.0090 bp-1) suggesting gene flow from the wild to cultivated chickpea. Linkage groups of the present wild chickpea genome assembly was used as the reference for mapping restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequence reads generated from 10 C. reticulatum, and 56 (28 each of desi and kabuli) cultivated chickpea accessions to assess sequence diversities. Total 15,096 SNPs discovered revealed high average pair-wise nucleotide diversity within the wild (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.338) as compared to that within the cultivated chickpeas (0.296). Nucleotide diversities were compared between the wild and domesticated accessions in the intergenic regions of the orthologous gene pairs representing two aforementioned younger and older peaks. The nucleotide diversity in the intergenic regions of the genes belonging to younger peak (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.33) was significantly lower (P-value < 0.0063) than that of the older peak (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.37) further implicating the occurrence of gene flow from the wild to the domesticated chickpea. Nucleotide diversities of the wild and domesticated chickpeas were plotted along the linkage groups (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S17). Expectedly, LG 4 showed the highest average nucleotide variation within the wild (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.389) and the domesticated chickpeas (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.320). Out of total 7,185 SNPs within the wild chickpea accessions, 3,615 SNPs were found to be present in all 10 C.reticulatum accessions, and 1,083 and 611 of these were shared with all the desi and kabuli accessions, respectively. Four hundred and thirty-nine SNPs were found common in all the wild and domesticated chickpeas used in this study. Flanking sequences of the unique SNPs present within the wild, desi and kabuli chickpeas were provided as marker resource (Supplementary Table S18).Although, there are many contrasting phenotypic differences between wild and cultivated chickpeas and also between the desi and kabuli landraces such as, erectness, seed coat and flower colour, sizes of seed, leaf and whole plant, in contrast to other grain legumes, the major trait for chickpea domestication was the change in the cropping season and associated loss of vernalization response.47 In Arabidopsis, functional VRN1 and VRN2 genes are required to maintain vernalization response.48,49VRN1 and VRN2 orthologues in the wild and domesticated chickpea genome assemblies did not show any sequence variation in the CDS. However, 5'-upstream activating sequences (5'-UAS) of VRN1 orthologues in the desi and kabuli genome assemblies showed a 35 base insertion at around 1.1 kb upstream of the translation start codon as compared to their orthologue in the wild chickpea. Ten accessions each of desi and kabuli chickpea and 4 accessions of C. reticulatum were used to verify this sequence variation by PCR amplification followed by sequencing. All the 20 chickpea cultivars used showed 35 base larger amplification products than the 4 accessions of wild chickpea (Supplementary Fig. S10). On the other hand, in case of VRN2 orthologue located at LG8, a conversion of a dinucleotide repeat (TC)15, present around 200 bp upstream to the translation start codon in the wild genotype, to (TC)49 and (TC)25 was observed in the desi and the kabuli genome assemblies, respectively. This sequence variation was verified in 10 accessions each of desi and kabuli chickpea and 4 accessions of C. reticulatum. The extent of this repeat varied in the domesticated and wild accessions when investigated by PCR amplification. However, all the used wild accessions displayed shorter repeat sequence than the cultivated accessions (Supplementary Fig. S11). Further investigations are required to associate these structural variations with the vernalization response in chickpea.3.6 Molecular diversity, phylogeny and population genetic structureThe estimation of pair-wise genetic distance among 28 accessions each of desi and kabuli chickpea and 10 accessions of wild C. reticulatum (Supplementary Table S19) using 15,096 SNPs physically mapped over eight pseudomolecules of LGs of the present assembly depicted a wide range of distance coefficient from 0.13 to 0.56 with an average of 0.35. The genetic distance between the desi and kabuli cultivar groups (distance coefficient 0.35) was least as compared to that of desi versus wild (0.42) and kabuli versus wild (0.45). The genetic relationship among 56 cultivated and 10 wild chickpea accessions was depicted in an unrooted dendrogram (Fig. 4a). The SNPs clearly discriminated all the 66 accessions from each other resulting in a definite grouping among desi and kabuli and wild chickpeas. The accessions belonging to wild C. reticulatum were clustered together in a group distinctly from the desi and kabuli cultivars.

The colour version of the figure is available online. The population genetic structure was determined among the 66 cultivated and wild accessions using the physically mapped SNPs. The optimization of population structure at varying levels of K (K = 2–10) with 20 replications revealed that at K value of 3, all the 66 cultivated and wild accessions were classified majorly into three distinct populations, wild, kabuli and desi as per expected pedigree relationships and parentage (Fig. 4b). This was agreed-well with the clustering pattern as observed among 66 chickpea accessions by the phylogenetic tree analysis using pair-wise genetic distances (Fig. 4a). Based on population structure analysis, the population group I consisting of 10 accessions of wild C. reticulatum, group II with 26 and 4 accessions of kabuli and desi, respectively and group III having 24 and 2 accessions of desi and kabuli, respectively. The molecular genetic variation among and within the three populations based on the SNPs exhibited a wider level of quantitative genetic differentiation (FST varied from 0.17 to 0.54 with an average of 0.38) among three population groups. Among the three population groups, the divergence was maximum between group II (kabuli) and group I (wild) (FST = 0.47) and minimum between group III (desi) and group II (kabuli) (FST = 0.15). The proportion of FST and thus diversity between the population groups was higher as compared to that estimated within populations. Higher genetic differentiation was observed in kabuli than that of desi. All the 6 cultivated chickpea and 10 wild accessions clearly belonged to a single population in which about 81.3% of their inferred ancestry was derived from one of the model-based population and remaining ~18.7% contained admixed ancestry. Maximum admixture (~12%) was observed between group II (kabuli) and group III (desi) populations followed by group III (desi) and group I (wild) (~4%) and group II (kabuli) and wild (~2%) populations (Fig. 4b).DISCUSSIONWild relatives of chickpea are underexploited resource for introducing genomic variation in the domesticated species, which is suffering from a narrow genetic base. The draft genome assembly of the inter-crossable wild progenitor C. reticulatum would provide an excellent resource for studying allelic variation and domestication of chickpea. The assembled pseudomolecules of eight linkage groups in the present draft assembly are equivalent in length to those in the published assemblies of the cultivated species1,3 and were constructed with larger sequence scaffolds. Almost the whole gene spaces of the respective species have been covered in the corresponding assemblies and, therefore, the analyses presented in this report including the resource of polymorphic SSRs and SNPs between the wild and the domesticated species would provide a significant resource for genome-wide large-scale genotyping applications. The reference-based assemblies produced by mapping C. reticulatum reads on two chickpea draft genome assemblies could be used for direct comparison between the wild and the domesticated species. Domestication process of chickpea followed a different course from the other crops domesticated in Fertile Crescent.4 Geographical distributions of two domesticated chickpea types are distinctly separate. While the kabuli type is restricted mostly in the Western Mediterranean, the desi type is mostly grown in the Central Asia and Indian subcontinent. It is possible that the domestication traits were fixed before the evolution of agriculture and subsequent selection based on local adaptation occurred during domestication. Comparative analysis showed desi type chickpea genome was relatively closer to the wild as compared to the kabuli type. However, at present, selection of kabuli type from desi type chickpea50 appears unlikely because of extent of genomic variations between this two types considering separation of only a few thousand years. Additionally, molecular diversity analysis clearly separates these two types. Therefore, an early separation predating agriculture followed by domestication-associated selection according to local adaptability may provide an alternative hypothesis of chickpea domestication process.Detection of a wider molecular diversity and genetic base using genome-wide SNPs would be much relevant in establishing distinctness and selection of desirable plant types for varietal improvement in chickpea. As expected, the correspondence of clustering pattern obtained among the accessions belonging to desi, kabuli and wild chickpea groups with the pedigree relationship and parentage further suggests that the molecular diversity assessed by genome-wide SNPs is realistic and thus would be useful in chickpea genomics-assisted breeding. The admixed ancestry among three populations might be due to their complex breeding history involving inter-crossing and introgression among desi, kabuli and wild chickpea accessions along with strong selection pressure and evolutionary bottleneck during chickpea domestication.4,51 Higher admixture (~5%) among 2 wild C. reticulatum accessions (ILWC 247 and ILWC 242) and 1 each of desi (ICC 16374) and kabuli (ICC 11847) accessions originated from Syria is expected due to involvement of C. reticulatum as one of the parents in cross-breeding program for their varietal improvement. This reflects more influence of parentage/geographical origination rather than cultivar-specific classification especially in higher admixed 6 desi and kabuli and 3 wild C. reticulatum accessions. Collectively, the genome assembly and annotation of the wild progenitor of chickpea, and the comparative analysis with the domesticated species would increase opportunities for more strategic use of the wild germplasms for improved crop management.We acknowledge funding from the National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India.

IntroductionThe genus Enterococcus (E.) belongs to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) group and includes nearly 50 species characterized for being facultative anaerobic, non-spore forming and catalase-negative.1,2 They can be associated with humans, animals, plants, water and fermented foods or used as probiotics. Their application in the production of artisanal fermented products such as cheeses, meats and olives, inter alia is founded on their contribution in the typical taste and flavor of the final products as well as on their hygienic quality.1,3 The genus has also the potential to promote health by stimulating the immune system, assisting digestion and maintaining normal intestinal microflora and is thus frequently used in probiotic preparations.4,5 Despite the aforementioned, they are also known for their potential to cause disease being the antimicrobial resistance transferability and virulence phenomena of paramount importance.6The advent of next-generation technologies has allowed the number of sequenced bacterial genomes to multiply and consequently, has given the possibility of carrying out numerous comparative studies seeking to establish patterns of behavior and evolutionary relationships.7 Tettelin et al.8 introduced the concept of pan-genome. This term refers to the global gene repertoire of a group of organisms consisting of a core genome (genes present in all members of the group) and a dispensable genome (unique and accessory genes present in one or more than one but not all organisms, respectively).8 Numerous studies evidenced that the gene content of a genome and it structure can be affected during organism’s adaptation to a specific niche9 and are the consequence, between others, of processes like horizontal gene transfer (HGT), genome rearrangement and gene loss. For the bacterial family Vibrionaceae, Kahlke et al. showed that unique core genes appear more often in groups of isolates with a common ancestor (monophyletic) and, in the particular case of Vibrio cholerae, play a fundamental role in its adaptation to the ecological niche. Likewise, they indicated that in genophyletic groups of isolates (with no closest common ancestor) core genes are mainly the result of HGT.9 In Pseudomonas putida, meanwhile, the presence of genomic islands carrying genes related to it specific lifestyle pointed out HGT as the driving force of it adaptation to a certain niche.10 In relation to LAB, Douillard and de Vos described that the enormous diversity in the members of this group, as evidenced by comparative genomics studies, is the result of genome-environment interactions. The availability of nutrients in a specific habitat have a direct impact on metabolic properties of LAB. Many species present an enrichment in genes encoding for transporters (ABC or PTS systems) to compensate the loss of genes of biosynthetic pathways.11The study of enterococcal genomes has grown considerably in recent years with special attention in comparative genomic analysis among clinical relevant isolates. In this sense, several studies have focused on the comparison of the safety aspects of clinical and non-clinical E. faecium and E. faecalis strains12 but, to our knowledge, Enterococcus species of food origin have not been investigated in detail so far, what is surprising given the abundance of these microorganisms in certain fermented food.Through an exhaustive comparative genomic analysis the goal of our manuscript was to identify common genetic features, features that are specific to enterococcal strains isolated from a certain food related source as well as those present in a species-specific manner. Furthermore, since several studies have shown that foodborne enterococci have a great potential as probiotics,13,14Enterococcus strains with probiotic properties were also incorporated to the analysis in spite of having or not food as natural niche. In this way, we sought to evaluate, at the genomic level, which were the shared traits between probiotics and food related strains. For this, the genome sequences of 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, who were the only one with full information about the isolation source by the time of data collection, were selected. Their phylogenetic relationship was determined at nucleotide and amino acid level comparing whole genome alignments and orthologous proteins, respectively. In addition, a search for markers associated with a successful colonization (bacteriocin genes and genomic islands) and genome plasticity (phages and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) was performed. Since antibiotic resistance is of big concern in the food industry, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes was also investigated.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequences and annotationAccording to their isolation source and probiotic potential 25 enterococcal genomic sequences, belonging to seven different species, were retrieved from the NCBI database from December 2014 to July 2015; these included: E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. mundtii, E. hirae, E. malodoratus, E. raffinosus and E. durans. In a next step, the strains were assigned to one of three major groups: dairy isolates, meat isolates and probiotics; and a fourth group was created: probiotics with dairy origin, for those strains with both properties. The dataset thus comprises 3 complete and 22 draft genomes.In order rely on a directly comparable annotation of genes, we performed a functional annotation combined with a metabolic reconstruction using the RAST (Rapid Annotation Subsystem Technology) webservice.15 For running the analyses the following settings were made: RAST for gene calling, FIGfam Release 70 as the collection of protein families, backfilling of gaps and automatic fixing of errors. Besides rRNAs and tRNAs, RAST identifies protein coding genes and allowed us to achieve a high quality assessment of the gene functions and their genomic context.2.2. Phylogenetic analysisWhole genomes of all enterococcal species and strains including Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, Lactococcus garvieae Lg2, Listeria monocytogenes HCC23 and Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 as outgroups were aligned using progressive Mauve.16 All reported alignment blocks present in at least two genomes were concatenated. As using all species and strains at once partially lead to weak bootstrap scores (<10%, probably due to much missing data for incomplete genomes, data not shown), the tree was constructed iteratively in two steps. At species level, we substituted species with multiple strains by a single representative strain that had a fully sequenced genome, namely E. faecalis str. Symbioflor 1 for E. faecalis, E. faecium NRRLB-2354 for E. faecium and E. mundtii ATCC882 for E. mundtii. The resulting 8,602,893 nt long multiple alignment was used in a rapid bootstrap analysis with RAxML v8.1.2017 with 1000 replicates to search for best-scoring maximum likelihood tree with respect to the GTR substitution model and the Gamma model of rate heterogeneity.18 We performed the same analysis at strain level separately for each species resulting in multiple alignments of lengths 3,336,408 nt for E. faecalis, 4,304,502 nt for E. faecium and 5,683,060 nt for E. mundtii. In the latter alignment, E. malodoratus had to be added as phylogenetic trees cannot be reconstructed from three instances (strains) only. It was removed from the resulting tree after reconstruction.We used Proteinortho v5.1.1219 to determine universally conserved 1:1-orthologs in all species and strains (including the four outgroup species as above) with respect to the proteins annotated through RAST (E-value: 1e-10, algebraic connectivity:0). Groups containing any paralogs were removed. Hence, the resulting 455 orthologous groups contained highly similar proteins present once in all species of interest. Amino acid sequences of orthologous proteins were aligned using ClustalOmega v1.2.1.20 The resulting alignment was cropped at both ends till leading and trailing gaps were removed. All alignments were concatenated to single sequences representing one species/strain each resulting in a multiple sequence alignment of 134,771 aa. Based on these, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using RAxML v8.1.2017. A rapid bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates to search for best-scoring maximum likelihood tree with respect to the LG matrix and the Gamma model of rate heterogeneity18 was performed. To make sure we did not observe effects due to over-representation of some species (E. faecium is present with 13 strains in the dataset comprising 29 genomes) the phylogenetic reconstruction was repeated using only one representative strain for species with multiple strains as described above. Their tree topologies were equivalent (data not shown) indicating no such effect.3. Niche-specific proteins and core proteomeWe directly used the FIGfam annotation classes provided by RAST to group predicted proteins according to their function. We want to note that these classes usually encapsulate multiple instances of different proteins (e.g. paralogs) and thus provide a rough approximation of function rather than reflecting fine-grained homology relations. For each enterococci group (dairy, meat, probiotics) and combination of groups (e.g. dairy and meat and so on), we set a filter such that only those classes remain that are present in at least a given percentage of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group. Thereby, the two strains that are probiotics but were extracted from a dairy origin, E. faecium L-3 and E. faecalis MB5259, were dynamically assigned to either group (e.g. to dairy when the dairy group was checked). In order to avoid species specific results, we removed all genes solely found in strains of a single species.Given the amount of incomplete genomes (missing data) and diversity of seven different species it was not surprising that no niche specific genes could be located when applying a presence threshold of 100–60%. At 50% a number of specific gene classes were located but not for dairy and the meat/probiotic combination. We decreased it further to 40% in order to recover specificities of all groups under this study. As statistical evaluation we repeated the analysis 1000 times with random group labels (fixed group sizes) and counted how often a gene family would be reported specific for any group. The results were used as expectation values (E-values), e.g. FIG00632402 was reported 26 times in random 1000 runs and therefore is represented with an E-value of 0.026.4. Genomic features4.1. Bacteriocin and antibiotic resistance genesBacteriocin-coding genes were searched using BAGEL 321. Mining for modified and non-modified bacteriocins was carried out following two different approaches, one based on the analysis of the gene context, and the other on the identification of the gene itself. Since the gene coding for Enterocin A, entA, could not be located by this program, it was manually assessed by BLAST22 using the sequence firstly described by Aymerich et al.23 (GI: 1296521) as a query and the enterococcal genomes as the database (E-value = 8e-100).Furthermore, a search for antibiotic resistance genes was performed through the ARG-ANNOT tool.24 For this a BLAST22 in Bioedit25 against the ARG-ANNOT database (April 2015, http://en.mediterranee-infection.com/article.php?laref=23%26titre=arg-annot) was carried out. We used moderately stringent conditions (E-Value  =  1e-5), the Blosum 62 substitution matrix26 and allowed for gapped blast hits. To reduce redundancy, only those results with = 70% of query coverage and = 90% sequence identity were taken into account. The antibiotics classes included in the database are: aminoglycosides, beta-lactamases, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, macrolide-lincosamid-estreptogramin, phenicols, rifampicin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim.4.2. Prophage sequences and CRISPRs—Cas systemsIntact and incomplete prophage regions were identified through the integrated search and annotation tool PHAST.27 This involved an ORF prediction and translation with GLIMMER 3.0228, a BLAST-based annotation (using a non-redundant bacterial protein library), a tRNA and tmRNA sites localization for attachment sites recognition (tRNAscan-SE29 and ARAGORN30), a phage sequence identification (BLAST against a custom phage/prophage sequence database available at http://phast.wishartlab.com/Download.html) and a density calculation of gene clusters via DBSCAN.27 Only intact regions were analyzed in depth.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) were predicted with the CRISPRFinder web service.31 In this way, the highly conserved regions known as direct repeats (DR) (23–55 bp long) and spacers (0.6–2.5 the repeated length) were localized. Putative CRISPR cassettes having at least three motifs (DR + spacer) and a minimum of two identical DRs were considered as confirmed CRISPRs, while the remaining candidates were named as questionable. CRISPRFinder databases are available at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr/(Database status: Last update 2014-08-05).4.3. Genomic islandsIslandViewer 332 was used for the identification of genes of probable horizontal origin. For localizing genomic islands (GEIs) this tool integrates three different methods: IslandPath-DIMOB,33 SIGI-HMM34 and IslandPick.35 The first two predict GEIs considering the sequence composition, while the latter uses a comparative genomics approach.36,37 For further analysis, the islands predicted for at least one method that were completely included in a contig (in the case of draft genomes), were taken into account. Next, in order to find which GEIs are the same in different organisms we run Proteinortho (all vs all blastp of protein sequences encoded on each GEI) with default options but omitting the final clustering step (algebraic connectivity: 0, E-value = 1e-10). Based on the resulting graph, we extracted the pairwise amount of shared proteins for the respective GEIs and plotted them in a heatmap using the gplots R-package.31 Thereby predicted paralogs could be assigned to a single gene in another GEI (e.g. if one GEI has two paralogs that are orthologous to a gene in another GEI, then both have a partner in this GEI resulting in a similarity of 2/2 = 100% in one direction and 1/1 = 100% vice versa). All islands that did not share at least 50% of their proteins with any other island were removed as were pairs of GEIs with less than four proteins. For sake of simplicity, the names of species were cropped to the end of the strain name followed by the number of the strain-specific genomic island. Thus 19116-i1 means E. faecalis 19116 genomic island 1. All groups of homologous GEIs present in at least four strains were investigated in more detail.5. Results and discussion5.1. Overview of the enterococcal genomesWe investigated 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, that had a food related origin and/or probiotic properties. Among them, a total of 13 E. faecium, 5 E. faecalis, 3 E. mundtii and 1 E. durans, E. hirae, E. malodoratus as well as E. raffinosus strains were included. Based on available data they were next incorporated into four major groups: dairy isolates (11 strains isolated from cheese or milk environment), meat isolates (6 strains of meat origin), probiotics (7 strains known for their ability or potential to be used as probiotics) and dairy isolates and probiotics (2 strains which were probiotics and had a dairy origin as well). In order to avoid erroneous conclusions, the members of the latter group were dynamically assigned to either group dairy isolates or probiotics when comparing.General genomic features of all the strains analyzed in this study are provided in Table 1. No significant differences (P = 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis statistical test) were observed between the groups in terms of the average number of genes and proteins (RAST annotation as stated above), genome size and GC content. Genome sizes ranged from approximately 2.5–4.6 Mb and GC contents from 36.8 to 39.9%. In agreement with our results, genomic similarities were previously described among E. faecalis strains irrespective of geographical, host temporal or clinical/non-clinical origin of the isolates.38 Singularly, the number of protein encoding genes and ncRNAs detected in E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 (dairy origin) and E. raffinosus CFTRI 2200 (probiotic) draft genomes were the highest, and this was in accordance with their genome sizes that were about 1.6 Mb bigger than the average size of the genomes of the rest of the organisms under study. Interestingly, the strains with the highest GC% in each group were those with a higher number of coding DNA sequence (CDS) in the respective group (E. faecium E1613 for meat isolates).

PhylogenyThe phylogenetic relationships of all strains were determined using two independent approaches. First, a genome based phylogenetic tree was built obtaining two main groups at species level (Fig. 1A). One of them, the most ancient, included the E. malodorous and E. raffinosus species represented by the strains E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 and E. raffinosus CFTRI 2200, respectively; and the other was comprised by the rest of the species under study: E. faecalis, E. mundtii, E. durans, E. hirae and E. faecium. In the latter group, E. faecalis formed a separate branch at the very beginning, and later in evolution, the same was observed first with E. mundtti and then with E. faecium. For their part, E. durans IPLA 655 and E. hirae INF E1 clustered together having with E. faecium the last common ancestor. This topology is in line with that of the 16S rRNA tree presented in Bergey’s manual.39 In the same way, the relationships observed when comparing a 1,102-bp fragment of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of ATP synthase atpA, from 91 Enterococcus strains, were in agreement with the phylogeny inferred from whole genomes in our study.40 According to Naser et al.40 this gene has an optimal discriminatory power that enables enterococcal species differentiation.

For details, see Materials and Methods.To provide an in-depth phylogenetic reconstruction we iterated the procedure at strain level. The E. faecium strains were separated into two major subgroups of which one also exhibited a more diverged subgroup comprising the two probiotic and very similar strains L-X and T-110. These results are in agreement with those reported by Palmer et al.41 which describe the E. faecium strains separation into two clades using orthologous groups but without including the two probiotic strains used here. In addition, non-clinical E. faecium strains clustered into two clades according to an analysis carried out by Kim et al.12In a second approach, we used protein sequences commonly shared in the species and strains under this study (Fig. 1B). Both analyses are in good agreement. However, in contrast to the genome based analysis, E. faecalis is reported as the most ancient branch of enterococci followed by the E. raffinosus and E. maloduratus cluster. As both trees branch with fairly high bootstrap values (0.96 and 0.86) a different evolutional pattern at nucleic and amino acid level can be assumed, leading to this result. Similarly, we find minor differences in the topology of the E. faecium group. We want to note that these findings were highly reproducible in all genome- and protein-based bootstrap runs. As for the genome-based tree, E. mundtti branched separately before E. faecium who shared it last ancestor with E. durans IPLA 655 and E. hirae INF E1.Both approaches led to the conclusion that non correlations between isolation source/probiotic properties and phylogenetic signal exist neither at species or strain levels. This indicates that niche specific adaptations do not affect the genome and proteome as a whole. In this direction, and analyzing strains of the same species individually, it was only seen that E. faecalis 2924 and 19116 from meat on the one hand, and the probiotic strains E. faecium L-X and E. faecium T-110, but not L-3, on the other hand, clustered together. We thus suppose adaptations to be located in the part of the proteome and genome that is not commonly shared among all strains of a certain species.5.3. Functional annotationAs a result of the functional annotation conducted with RAST it was possible to determine the features, assigned to subsystems that were (i) present in all organisms, (ii) related to the isolation source or strain property and (iii) species-specific (Fig. 2, Dataset 1). Among the strains of diary origin the average number of annotated protein encoding genes (PEGs) was 2,968; 2,739 for the meat isolates and 2,960 for the probiotics. In addition, it was seen that, for the former group, an average of 46.64% of the identified CDS were assigned to subsystems, 48.50% in case of the strains isolated from meat products and 49.29% for probiotics (Fig. 2A). Of those CDS assigned to subsystems, carbohydrates metabolism was the most enriched metabolic category. This is in accordance with the enterococcís ability to grow in different environments motivated by their capability of metabolizing at least 13 different kinds of sugar.42 Over 30 more can be utilized by at least two members of the genus. These carbohydrates sources are not limited to monomers, they are also usable as polymers.42 The second highest percentage of PEGs was in the protein metabolism category for E. faecium, E. hirae and E. mundtii, strains some of which share the dairy environment as source of isolation; meanwhile for E. malodoratus, E. raffinosus and E. faecalis species it was in the amino acids and derivatives category (Fig. 2B). In this regard, the Lactobacillus adaptation to the dairy niche has been associated with an increase in genes for peptide transport and hydrolysis.43Figure 2Open in new tabDownload slideCoding sequences dispensed in subsystems and their distribution in categories of metabolic function.

B) Distribution of metabolic functions in categories based on the subsystems features counts.None of the features of a certain functional role were exclusive of the members of one of the three major groups (dairy isolates, meat isolates, probiotics) under consideration (Dataset 1). This observation was valid when taking into account the 100, 60 and 40% of the members of each group for the respective comparison. However, it should be emphasized that 115 of a total of 254 subsystems analyzed were present in all the organisms and can thus be regarded as basic equipment of this genus. The number of CDS for the beta-glucoside metabolism was the most abundant in all groups (Dataset 1). Two beta-glucosides operons were present in all strains, the Bgl (beta-glucoside) and Cel (cellobiose) operons. The genes alsS and alsD of the alpha-acetolactate operon, encoding for the acetolactate synthase and alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, respectively, were also found in all the Enterococcus strains; both genes are involved in acetoin production from piruvate.32 Seventy-four out of the 115 subsystems were highly conserved as there was a difference of = 1 in the average number of features assigned to the strains of the different groups (Dataset 1). Interestingly, a higher number of genes of the beta-glucoside metabolism, lactose and galactose uptake and utilization, and fructose utilization subsystems were found, in most cases, in the dairy isolates and in probiotics; meanwhile, meat isolates had a greater abundance of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Dairy bacteria had, at the same time, on average more CDS related to chitin and N-acetylglucosamine utilization than the member of the other groups and probiotics, for their part, were in general more enriched in genes coding for the ABC transporter alkylphosphonate and the energy-coupling factor transporters.In parallel, an analysis aimed at evaluating the existence of species-specific genomic fingerprints sheds more conclusive results. Specifically, for those species that included more than one strain, it was seen that E. faecalis, for instance, had several features nucleated in subsystems of five different categories, some of them part of the lactate and ethanolamine utilization machinery. Ethanolamine utilization is considered a survival advantage for bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract and was also related to pathogens virulence.44E. faecium strains had, on the other hand, genes for the late competence event, fundamental for exogenous DNA acquisition, not localized in any other species; and E. mundtii strains had CDS of the carotenoids subsystem, responsible of their particular color, and one gene encoding a NG, NG-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1.5.4. Niche-specific proteins and core proteomeWe used the RAST annotation to determine genes of certain classes that could be located in a niche specific pattern and that were present in all species, irrespective of their origin (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S1, Data set 2). The least specific group in this regard was represented by the strains isolated from meat (all belonging to E. faecium or E. faecalis). This group exclusively exhibited the protein IbrB, a co-activator of gene expression which is most likely derived from prophage, and a methyltransferase that modifies adenine bases of the 18S rRNA (in eukaryotes). Both genes must thus be results of horizontal gene transfer related to the environment. On the other hand, most genes specific to dairy and probiotic strains were hypothetical proteins. In the dairy group, these were most pronounced as homologs were located in strains of four different species. Among others, this included an E. faecium strain, a species that is otherwise present in all three groups (dairy, meat, probiotics), indicating these hypothetical proteins to be highly niche specific adaptations, however, of unknown function. Interestingly, one of the niche-specific genes codes for a membrane transport protein that passively transfer molecules or ions through the cell membrane and could thus be related to the peculiarities of the dairy environment. For probiotic strains we have additionally located a putative DNA methyltransferase. Homologs are mainly known from the Haemophilus genus.45Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideVenn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideVenn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Venn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Venn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Looking at the overlap of shared genes, the meat and probiotic group had the least in common. Above of a phage lysin found in both groups, the fumarate reductase probably represented a true functional finding. Fumaric acid is a food additive used for antimicrobial preservation of meat to reduce the spread of pathogens.46 With respect to this background, it is reasonable to conclude that the respective strains from the group are able to degrade this acid in their habitat (meat isolates). Probiotic strains, on the other hand, might be in contact with fumaric acid in the gastrointestinal habitat, while it does not play a role for strains from the dairy group.The overlap of the dairy and the probiotic groups can also be seen as set of genes that were not present in the meat group. It contained three phosphonate ABC transporter proteins, all found linked in the same strains, indicating that phosphonates play an important role here but not in meat related environments. In addition two proteins related to galactoside metabolism were located. Both were reported with an E-value slightly above the 0.05 significance threshold (0.076). Again, this energy-source is obviously not important for meat related strains. Alongside with galactoside related proteins, a not further specifiable membrane transporter was identified to be present. Similarly the alpha-glycosyltransferase was found solely in the dairy and probiotic groups.With 15 shared proteins, the overlap of the meat and the dairy group seems rather large. Most of them, however, were related to phages (six) or were hypothetical proteins (five) often exhibiting weaker E-values closer to or slightly above 0.05. The remaining specific proteins were the ATP-binding protein p271, an ATPase component of an uncharacterized ABC-type transport system and, most interestingly a probable extracellular solute-binding protein that was present in the same strains as an arabinofuranosidase. Both might thus be related, indicating that arabinose might not be as relevant for probiotic strains.Finally, we determined the core proteome of all enterococci used in this study by asking which genes were present in 40% of all strains in all groups (see Materials and Methods). As a result, 1617 FIGfam families were located to be universally present. Out of them 1457 were found to be present in at least four different enterococci species. A detailed list can be found in Supplementary Table S1.6. Genomic features among food-related and probiotic enterococcal strains6.1. BacteriocinsGenes encoding bacteriocins are widely disseminated among enterococci from different origins.47 For probiotic bacteria, the ability to successfully outcompete undesired species is often due to, or enhanced by, the production of bacteriocins.48 With this background, a search for genes related to bacteriocins was carried out through BAGEL 3 and BLAST (Table 2). Number of antibiotic resistance and bacteriocin genes in the enterococcal genomesARG: antibiotic resistance gene; AGly: aminoglycosides; Gly: glycopeptides; MLS: macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin; Tet: tetracyclines; Tmt: trimethoprim.Number of antibiotic resistance and bacteriocin genes in the enterococcal genomesARG: antibiotic resistance gene; AGly: aminoglycosides; Gly: glycopeptides; MLS: macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin; Tet: tetracyclines; Tmt: trimethoprim.Of all species under examination, E. faecium was the one that harbored the larger number of bacteriocin genes in general, being the meat isolate E. faecium UC8733 the strain with the highest bacteriocinogenic potential with eight genes encoding for class II and two for class III bacteriocins. Reinforcing the idea, in previous studies we could identify six class II bacteriocin gene clusters in E. faecium CRL 187949 coincident with those found in NRRL B-2354, also of dairy origin. Moreover, and in agreement with our previous findings related to non-clinical and clinical E. faecium47, no correlations between the presence of enterocin structural genes and strains origin were observed in the present analysis. Özdemir et al.50 also described the same phenomenon among enterococcal species isolated from different origins (including river, treatment plant, spring and garbage water, soil, animal and vegetables).Enterocins A and B were always considered as hallmark of this genus. However, as we have shown previously, not all strains carrying enterocin A genes (entA) also harbor a enterocin B gene (entB).49 The first one (entA) was detected in CRL 1879, NRRL B-2354, UC8733, L-3, L-X and UC10237, all belonging to the E. faecium species. Surprisingly, the class III bacteriocin enterolysin A, a bacteriolysin, first characterized in E. faecalis, was not found in all strains belonging to this species. However, this gene was present in all E. faecium belonging to the three different groups (dairy isolates, meat isolates and probiotics) except in E. faecium UC10237 (Supplementary Table S2). Meanwhile, E. faecium E1613 (meat isolate) was the only with a CDS for Subtilosin A. As previously described51,52,E. mundtii CRL35 and E. mundtii CRL1656 (diary isolates) have the CDS for Enterocin CRL35 and Mundticin CRL1656, respectively. According to BAGEL, these were the only bacteriocin encoding genes that they carried within their genome (Supplementary Table S2). Regarding E. faecalis, the strains 19,116 and MB5259 (meat and dairy/probiotics, respectively) were the only harboring genes encoding for Cytolysin structural subunits CylLS and CylLL (Supplementary Table S2). In animal models of enterococcal infections it was observed that Cytolysin contributes to virulence,53 rendering this strain potentially pathogenic. Finally, no CDS related to bacteriocin production were found in the genomes of E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 (incomplete genome) and E. faecalis Symbioflor 1 (complete genome).6.2. Antibiotic resistance genesEnterococci have been defined as increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics in recent years.54 They have an intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics and can also acquire resistance to many others, including those of clinical use. E. faecium and E. faecalis are the most successful strains evolving as multi-resistant pathogens because of their ability to acquire and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes, encoded by mobile genetic elements.55 In this study, genes that conferred resistances to glycopeptides, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, tetracyclines and trimethoprim were detected. The in silico prediction of antibiotic resistance genes revealed that E. faecalis 2924, isolated from turkey meat in 2005, was the only strain carrying genes involved in vancomycin resistance, which is of high clinical importance. At the same time, this was the strain with the highest number of antibiotic resistance genes (14 protein-coding genes, see Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3). This finding is in line with the idea that the increased use of antibiotics in healthcare and animal husbandry is linked with the emergence, spreading and persistence of resistant strains in animal products.56 For example, some enterococci isolated from Portuguese traditional fermented meat products were resistant to erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin and tetracycline, but in this case none was to vancomycin.57 With ten resistance genes E. faecalis 19116 was the second in abundance (Table 2). In contrast, strains belonging to E. mundtii, E. durans and E. maloduratus species did not contain antibiotic resistance related CDS at all (Table 3). Remarkably, all of them were isolated from dairy origin indicating that at least in some instance, antibiotic resistances are of minor relevance in dairy environment compared to the other groups where no strain investigated completely lacks antibiotic resistance genes.

The aac(6')-Ii gene, is species-specific and encodes for a chromosomal aminoglycoside acetyltransferase specific for E. faecium strains.58 The 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferases [AAC (6')s] are of particular interest because they can modify a number of clinically important aminoglycosides and some of them are often present in integrons, transposons, plasmids, genomic islands and other genetic structures. AAC (6')-I-type enzymes effectively acetylate amikacin but not gentamicin. To date 45 such genes have been characterized.59 On the other hand, msrC encodes a putative efflux pump of the ABC transporter family and it seems that the presence of this gene confers an advantage for the members of this species.58 Similarly, the genes lsaA and mphD were found exclusively in the E. faecalis strains (Supplementary Table S3). Lsa gene, encodes a putative ABC protein that confers resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and clindamycin60 and is located in the chromosome. The gen mphD codes for a phosphorylase and belongs to the group of inactivating enzymes61 (Supplementary Table S3). The meat isolate E. faecium UC7251, unlike the other strains of this species, additionally had genes for resistance to antibiotics of the tetracyclines class, apart from the MLS resistance genes ermB and lnuB, and aminoglycosides resistance genes aph3-III and sat4A (Supplementary Table S3).6.3. Prophage sequences and CRISPRs—Cas systemsLysogenic phages are an important source of information related to bacterial pathogenesis.62 Comparative genomic analysis evidenced that polylysogeny is a common phenomenon in the Enterococcus genus.62 Particularly, in E. faecalis V583 temperate phages constitute the main source of horizontally acquired DNA representing nearly 10% the size of the genome.62Within the scope of this study we search for prophage-like sequences in the genomes. In this sense, as a result of the analysis performed with PHAST, we evidenced in all strains but E. mundtii CRL1656, E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 and E. faecium L-3, several intact regions related to different prophages associated with the Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Listeria, Bacillus, among other genera (Table 3). The temperate bacteriophages EFC-1 and PhiEf11, originally described in E. faecalis, had the highest number of CDS. PhiEf11 contained 63 from a total of 68 phage CDS in the probiotic strain MB5259, and EFC-1 38 CDS from a total of 72 in the meat isolate 19116. At the same time, the fEf11 phage was present in organisms belonging to four different species: E. durans IPLA 655, E. faecalis MB5259, E. mundtii CRL35, E. faecalis Symbioflor 1, E. faecium L-X and E. faecium T-110. Additionally, E. faecalis MB5259, a strain with probiotic properties and a dairy origin had a total of five intact phage related regions with CDS from different phages (Table 3).It is interesting to note that all strains from meat origin harbored only one intact prophage region and that E. faecium UC7251 contained the largest intact phage-related region (70.1 kb) with the bacteriophage Lister 2389, isolated from Listeria monocytogenes strain Scott A,63 having 16 from a total of 64 CDS located in that region. In E. faecalis 2924 and PC1.1 another Listeria phage, LP-101, was located. Interestingly, this phage was first obtained from silage samples collected on a dairy farm.64 Then Listeria phage B025 related coding sequences were localized on the intact region of E. faecium UC10237 (Table 3). Bacillus phage BCJA1c had the highest protein counts in UC7267, ATCC-882, CRL35 and L-X, but none in those meat related strains and Lactococcus phages related proteins were the most abundant in E. mundtii CRL35 and E. faecium L-X intact phage regions (Table 3).Related to the acquisition of phages and other mobile elements, enterococci that possess CRISPR-Cas systems, are less likely to acquire phages and other mobile elements.65 We found that E. raffinosus CFTRI 2200, with four individual gene cassettes, was the strain with the highest number of these prokaryotic immune systems among all under evaluation (Table 4). At the same time, one of these four CRISPRs, with a size of 1215 bp, was the largest identified. E. faecium UC7256 and E. hirae INF E1, both dairy isolates, had two confirmed CRISPRS systems each. Regarding meat isolates, E. faecalis 2924, E. faecium E1613 and E. faecium UC7251, had confirmed clusters with five, three and three spacers, respectively. All members of the probiotics group but E. faecium T-110 had confirmed CRISPR systems (Table 4). Among the confirmed CRISPR systems of all organisms DR sizes ranged from 23 to 37 bp and the number of spacers from 3 to 18.

These are characterized by abundant mobile DNA, including phages, plasmids and transposons that carries multiple antibiotic resistances. Palmer et al. found that antibiotic resistance and possession of complete CRISPR loci are inversely related and that members of recently emerged high-risk enterococcal lineages lack complete CRISPR loci suggesting that antibiotic therapy inadvertently selects for enterococci with compromised genome defense.65 However, we cannot confirm these findings with our results regarding food-related strains. Especially for dairy isolates we frequently found no confirmed CRISPR system but also no antibiotic resistance genes (IPLA 655, ATCC 43197, ATCC 882, CRL1656). Vice versa the probiotic isolate CFTRI 2200 was heavily armed both with four confirmed CRISPR systems and at least four antibiotic resistance genes (see Tables 2 and 4), observations that are opposite to the findings described for the strains of clinical relevance.Interestingly, the analysis of the gene context of all confirmed CRISPR systems identified by CRISPRFinder evidenced the existence of CRISPR associated genes (cas) upstream the CRISPR cassette only in INF E1 (confirmed CRISPR #2) and CFTRI 2200 (confirmed CRISPR #3). The former has genes exclusive of a Type II CRISPR-Cas system subtype II-A, while the latter related to a Type I CRISPR-Cas system subtype I-B.66,67 These results suggest that the systems detected in the other strains might not be functional or their specific cas related genes are located further than 2000bp upstream or downstream the CRISPR cassette.On the other hand, No confirmed CRISPR system was detected in CRL1879, NRRL B-2354, UC7267, 19116, UC8733 and UC10237 strains.6.4. Genomic islandsHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the phenomena responsible of the diversification and adaptation of microorganisms, and has a direct impact on the genome plasticity and size; it is believed that the majority of the HGT has been facilitated by genomic islands (GEIs).68 In this respect, a detailed analysis of the enterococcal genomes allowed us to identify many GEIs and to correlate them according to the similarity of the encoded CDS (Fig. 4). From the GEI detected, all groups found in at least five different strains were further evaluated. With the exception of the GEI number 5, all four remaining islands were E. faecium-related to the major extend. A correlation with respect to the isolation origin cannot be observed nor can an exclusive occurrence in strains of a certain species (Supplementary Table S4).

GEIs play a crucial role in dissemination of variable genes, such us antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, and can contribute to the generation of the currently well-known named hospital ‘superbugs’. However, none of the five GEIs here evaluated contains CDS related to known pathogenic markers of clinical relevant enterococcal species. With 33 to 36 CDS GEI 1 (Supplementary Table S4a) was the biggest island containing mainly ribosomal proteins and translation factors along with accessory proteins for transcription and translation and protein secretion (e.g. RNA polymerase, Preprotein translocase secY).In agreement with one of the ideas that considers GEIs an overarching family of elements, as is the case of mobile DNA elements constituted by integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), conjugative transposons and some prophages, we found for instance integrases in GEI 2 (XerD, Supplementary Table S4b) and GEI 5 (Supplementary Table S4e) and phage-related proteins in GEI 4 (Supplementary Table S4d). It has been previously described that the coding capacity of GEIs is not limited to pathogenicity functions and can be very diverse including such traits as symbiosis, sucrose and aromatic compound metabolism, mercury resistance and siderophore synthesis.69,70 Thereof especially GEIs 2 and 3 (Supplementary Table S4b and c) encoded some interesting CDS. Among others, some examples were the ferric uptake regulation protein (oxidative stress), an enolase (pyruvate metabolism) and a triosephosphate isomerase (sugar metabolism). Finally, the third group of genes was that of hypothetical proteins with unknown function which was highly abundant in GEI 4 and 5 (Supplementary Table S4d and e) rendering any interpretation futile.7. ConclusionIn this work we performed a detailed comparative analysis of food-related and probiotic enterococcal genomes. As previously demonstrated by our group, bacteriocin genes were widely distributed among E. faecium strains. Interestingly, antibiotic resistance genes were predominant in those organisms of meat origin coincidentally with the notion of the unrestricted use of antibiotics in husbandry. A search for regions enriched in phage related coding sequences evidenced that they were extensively propagated throughout the genus. In dairy isolates, phages derived from bacteria commonly associated to the milk environment, such us Listeria, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. Interestingly, only two strains carried a complete CRISPR-Cas system (CFTRI 2200 and INF E1) but potential orphan cassettes were localized in the rest of the species. Importantly, five GEIs were found to be the same in different organisms and none of them contained CDS related with known pathogenic markers of clinical relevant enterococcus species.Our in-depth phylogenetic reconstruction yielded that strains form clusters in accordance to their species but not to their isolation origin or probiotic properties. While we determined a set of 1617 FIGfam families as core proteome universally present among the genera, we were also able to identify several proteins that seem to occur in a strain-overarching but niche-specific pattern. Besides some phage-related regions/genes that seemingly occur in a habitat-dependent fashion, there was a specific membrane transport protein found exclusively in dairy isolates. Moreover, our data indicated that only dairy isolates could be found without any antibiotic resistance genes. All strains from the other groups code for at least one such gene. On the other hand, all dairy isolates were missing a gene coding for fumarate reductase generally present in meat isolates and probiotics. Enterococci isolated from meat origins lacked three phosphonate ABC transporters and two proteins related to galactoside metabolism that were otherwise found in most dairy isolates and probiotics. Moreover, arabinose-related proteins were missing from probiotics. Finally, we located a number of additional niche-specific but hypothetical proteins, a finding that might nevertheless aid in their future functional characterization. In principal, any of these specific genes could be used as indicator for the original habitat of a species making it possible to trace e.g. the origin of a strain that developed pathogenicity.Based on the above described we can suggest that dairy isolates have greater potential than meat isolates for use as probiotics, at least at the genomic level, and their formal application in the future will require deep analysis including biochemical tests and in vitro as well as in vivo experiments.Other than that, we also observed niche-specific features at species level. For instance, the antibiotic resistance genes lsaA and mphD were found exclusively in the E. faecalis strains that belonged to the probiotics and meat isolates groups but not in those isolated from dairy. Also, only Enterococcus faecalis strains from meat origin and probiotics had a set of genes for ethanolamine utilization.Regarding the data, parallel evolution via horizontal gene transfer seems a likely cause for many specific genes reported here. We assume that most were acquired after speciation due to similar environments. This is certainly true for phage-related genes, likely being a result of the environment rather than a prerequisite. Also a number of specific genes were only present in less than half of all representatives of a niche and most were located mainly in E. faecalis and E. faecium strains specific to a certain niche (see Table 2). With respect to the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) one would expect them to occur in some species in between as well if they were already present in a common ancestor. There are, however, notable exceptions. Specific genes present in five or even six of the seven enterococci species under this study that occur in a niche-specific manner were likely present in the common ancestor and probably got lost in strains that did not gain advantage of them anymore due to specialization, e.g. to a different niche or habitat. Here we especially refer to the phosphonate ABC transporters and the genes related to galactoside metabolism.Altogether, our data demonstrated that while a few niche-specific genomic features of enterococci can be identified, relevant genomic idiosyncrasies mainly depend on the species in the first place rather than a specific niche or habitat.This study was carried out with the financial support from CONICET (PIP0406/12) and MinCyT (PICT2011 N°0175) from Argentina.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAdvances in genome sequencing technology have resulted in a large amount of raw data in the form of whole genome sequences of organisms. This sequence data needs to be annotated, viz. identification of coding regions, non-coding regions and regulatory elements. Computational tools are the only viable option for fast and fairly reliable annotation of many genome sequences. Promoter prediction is an important step in the genome annotation process; not only for the validation of the predicted genes but also for the identification of novel genes, especially those associated with non-coding RNA, which are often missed by gene prediction programs. Identification of transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) and promoters is essential for understanding transcription and regulation of the genes. Regulatory regions that affect the transcription initiation process are beyond the target DNA sequence motifs.1–4 There are studies in which DNA structural features are integrated with motif search algorithms to identify TFBSs5,6. DNA shape determined by four distinct features—Minor groove width, Propeller twist, Roll and Helix twist has been found to be an important determinant in the identification of TFBSs and transcription start sites (TSSs).7–9 Physico-chemical properties of DNA double helix such as hydrogen bonding, stacking energy etc. show DNA sequence functional density signatures.10–12 Promoter regions have been found to be associated with some unique structural features (like low stability, lesser bendability and more curvature etc.) across organisms.13–16 Promoter annotation based on the relative stability of DNA duplex has been found to be more reliable and accurate for a wide range of prokaryotes, compared with sequence based approaches.17,18 PromBase is a comprehensive database which provides promoter predictions, based on relative stability, for whole genome sequences of bacteria and archaea with respect to their Translation Start Sites.19 Profiles of some other structural properties, such as bendability and curvature are also displayed in addition to stability. A previous study has shown that different categories of promoters (primary, secondary and internal promoters) display a gradation in their sequence dependent structural properties and which is mostly conserved for orthologous genes in ten strains of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.20 Non-B DNA structural motifs are preferentially located in the regulatory regions of operons in E. coli.21The recent study in Mycoplasma pneumonia shows that free energy of promoter region is an important determinant in the identification of true promoter from abortive and non promoters, apart from sequence elements such as -10, extended -10 and -35 box.22Whole genome transcriptome studies reveal the pervasive nature of transcription and suggest that transcription is not restricted to regions upstream of the annotated coding sequences (CDSs) but can initiate from almost any genomic location.23 The wide variety of transcripts like mRNA, internal, antisense and non-coding RNA have been found to exist in the prokaryotic genome. Large fractions of these non-coding RNAs are found to be functional and are involved in various regulatory activities in the cell.24 Antisense transcripts play an important role in gene regulatory networks and constitute a secondary layer of regulatory switch, which has great potential in genetic engineering.25,26 Hence, annotation of non-coding transcripts is crucial for a complete understanding of functional genomics and gene regulatory circuits.26,27 To address these issues, we have studied structural properties of the promoter regions in different categories of transcripts characterized in the transcriptome of six different model organisms, viz. H. pylori, Anabaena, Synechocystis, E. coli, Salmonella and Klebsiella. The genomic GC content for these organisms varies from 39% for H. pylori to 57% for Klebsiella (Table 1). We used the differences in these properties between promoter regions and the flanking sequences to predict promoters associated with the different categories of transcripts such as primary, internal, antisense and non-coding RNA. Ability to predict the strength of a promoter is the next challenge in promoter annotation process. Sequence motif based approaches have been reported for E. coli, which predict the strength of the promoter moderately well in an organism specific manner.28–30 DNA thermodynamics and supercoiling dynamics have been found to be associated with gene expression during different bacterial growth cycle.31,32 Following this up, we have analysed the relationship between DNA structural features and the strength of the promoter, in terms of gene expression in six different model organisms.  Genomic features and number of TSSs of various categories in six different model organisms used in this studyAbbreviations used: gTSS, primary TSS; iTSS, internal TSS; aTSS, antisense TSS; nTSS, non-coding TSS. Genomic features and number of TSSs of various categories in six different model organisms used in this studyAbbreviations used: gTSS, primary TSS; iTSS, internal TSS; aTSS, antisense TSS; nTSS, non-coding TSS.2. Material and methods2.1. Promoter sequence dataset preparationTSS information of H.pylori strain 2669533 (H.pylori), Anabaena sp. PCC712034 (Anabaena), Synechocystis sp. PCC 680335 (Synechocystis), E.coli K-12 MG165536 (E. coli), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium37 (Salmonella) and Klebsiella pneumoniae36 (Klebsiella) was obtained from the relevant published data. For each gene (protein/RNA), TSS with highest number of reads was selected for creating a unique dataset of primary/gTSS (transcribing mRNA), iTSS (TSSs present inside the gene), aTSS (corresponding to antisense transcripts, encompassed within the gene), whereas all available nTSS (non-coding transcripts) were taken (Table 1). Only those categories of TSSs, that had more than 100 TSSs, were selected for the study. Whole genome sequence and translation start site (TLS) information were downloaded from ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/) of NCBI. Genome sequences of 1001 nucleotides length (spanning 500 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the TSS positioned at 0) were extracted from the whole genome sequence using TSS information as provided in published data.Non-promoter sequence or negative dataset was created, by taking the CDS of the genes associated with gTSS (primary TSS).2.2. Estimation of structural properties of promoter sequencesWe have studied three sequence dependent structural properties stability, bendability and curvature. Stability of a piece of double stranded DNA sequence molecule can be calculated in terms of the free energy of its constituent dinucleotides. The free energy values of the 10 unique dinucleotides were taken from data based on melting studies of oligo and polynucleotides.38 Stability profile of 1001 nucleotides long promoter sequence was calculated by dividing each sequence in sliding windows of 15 base pairs each (or 14 dinucleotide steps) using the free energy values for the constituent dinucleotides. Average free energy (AFE) (in kcal/mol) was calculated at each nucleotide position after aligning all TSS at 0 position.39Bendability of promoter sequences was calculated by using two different trinucleotide models, DNase I sensitivity40 (DNase I) and nucleosomal positioning preference (NPP).41 Bendability profile was calculated using a 30 nucleotides window size.Curvature of promoter sequence was estimated by the calculated value of d/lmax (the ratio of minimum end to end distance ‘d’ to the length of a DNA fragment ‘lmax’)42 for the models generated using a set of dinucleotide values obtained from gel retardation mobility assay of multiple polymeric DNA sequences (BMHT).43 The DNA models were generated using 75 nucleotides window size and d/lmax vale was calculated by using in-house program NUCGEN.44 Values of d/lmax ranges from 0 (completely closed circle indicating high curvature) to 1 (perfectly linear DNA).2.3. Promoter prediction methodologyPromoter sequences of 1001 nucleotide length from six different bacteria were categorized on the basis of their GC composition (at 5% GC intervals). Sequence information was translated to numerical information in terms of structural properties mentioned above. The training set of promoter sequences were selected from the primary TSS promoters, associated with gTSS. A 5-fold analysis was performed, by selecting 80% as training dataset and it was applied on full dataset. Two independent cycles of cutoff derivation and promoter predictions were performed using 75 and 100 nucleotide long windows, respectively, for all given structural features.The more prominent low stability peak was observed in the vicinity of TSS across all bacterium species. Hence, the region -55 to + 20 (with respect to TSS) was selected to derive one of the cutoff values (STB1) for the first cycle while -80 to + 20 region was taken for the second cycle. Promoters were predicted by comparing structural properties of neighboring regions; hence a 75 nucleotides window from +200 to + 275 with respect to TSSs and 100 nucleotides window from +200 to + 300 with respect to TSSs were chosen to derive second cutoff value (STB2) for stability for cycle one and cycle two respectively. Less bendability and high curvature span were observed in the upstream regions of TSSs across all the organisms. Hence -100 to -25 and -125 to -25 nucleotides with respect to TSSs were considered for derivation of first cutoff values for bendability (both models BDC1 and BNC1) and curvature (CBC1), for the first and second cycle of predictions respectively. Similarly, the second set of cutoff values for bendability (BDC2 and BNC2) and curvature (CBC2) were derived from +200 to + 275 and +200 to + 300 nucleotides with respect to TSSs for the first and second cycle of predictions, respectively.The cutoff values derived at 5%GC interval for all DNA sequence dependent structural properties were applied within -200 to + 100 nucleotide region (R1) and +200 to + 500 nucleotide region (R2) with respect to TSS in the full dataset. A given sequence was identified as a promoter sequence if a particular sequence dependent structural property was found to be present and satisfies the following set of conditions. R1 = STB1 & R2 = STB2 for stabilityR1= BDC1 & R2 = BDC2 for bendability (DNase I)R1 = BNC1 & R2 = BNC2 for bendability (NPP)R1 = CBC1 & R2 = CBC2 for curvatureSequences satisfying the above conditions were assigned as true positive (TP) for the representative feature, else they were classified as false negative (FN). In the negative dataset, +200 to + 500 nucleotide region was scanned for conditions mentioned earlier. If a sequence from negative dataset was found to satisfy above criteria then it was designated as false positive (FP) for the respective property, else it was tagged as true negative (TN).TP and TN rates were defined by calculating sensitivity (also known as recall) and specificity respectively, to measure the performance of binary classification test. Fidelity of the search was determined by calculating precision. Evaluation of classifier was done, by calculating balanced–accuracy and F-score, which are arithmetic and harmonic means of sensitivity and precision respectively.2.4. Gene expression estimationMicroarray expression profiling data (RNA sample from wild type) H. pylori (GSM931753), Synechocystis (GSM1316725), E. coli (GSM1374996), Salmonella (GSM1102757) and Klebsiella (GSM877524) was downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), NCBI.45. Differential expression was calculated by using DESeq (R/Bioconductor package)46 to measure the change in the expression fold in the absence of Nitrogen from transcriptome data.34 Primary TSSs (gTSS) were sorted in descending order (in the terms of their expression level) and top 10 percentile were considered as high expression genes expected to be associated with strong promoters. The bottom 10 percentile was taken as a dataset for low expression genes with weak promoters. Structural features were calculated for the sequences extracted using TSS location and strand information from the whole genome sequence.2.5. Statistical methodsStatistical significance of structural properties enrichment in the promoter regions of highly expressed genes as compared with lowly expressed genes were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test). One-sided two-sample KS test was performed to test the significance of the difference in feature value between the two classes (here null hypothesis was that the both datasets have similar CDF distribution). Null hypothesis was rejected at the significance level of 1%. MATLAB was used for statistical analysis.3. Results and discussion3.1 Promoter regions corresponding to prokaryotic transcriptomes show distinct structural propertiesWe have characterized DNA duplex stability (AFE), bendability using two different models DNase I sensitivity (DNase I) and NPP and intrinsic curvature in the promoter region of different categories of TSSs in six different model organisms. DNase I sensitivity model gives the bending propensity of each trinucleotide in terms of bending towards major groove while NPP model gives the rotational preference of each trinucleotide towards histone core. The DNA structural profiles show that promoter (primary) regions are in general less stable, less bendable and more curved as compared to neighboring regions (Fig. 1). DNA duplex stability, expressed in the terms of AFE (kcal/mol) profile, shows a low stability peak in the vicinity of the TSS across organisms with varying genomic GC content. With increase in genomic GC% from H. pylori with 39% to Klebsiella with 57% the baseline shifts to higher stability (lower AFE) values, while the low stability peak splits. The secondary low stability peak is likely to be associated with -35 element. Bendability profiles as calculated using two different trinucleotide models (DNase I and NPP), show similar low bendability peaks in the region upstream of the TSS. Curvature profile shows that the promoter region is more intrinsically curved as compared with flanking regions.

The number of promoter sequences and whole genome GC% is mentioned along with the organism name, on the left of each row.The shuffled promoter sequences obtained by the randomization of native promoter sequences do not show these properties, even when they were estimated separately for three different regions: upstream (-500 to -100 nucleotide), promoter region (-80 to +20 nucleotide) and downstream region (+100 to +500) nucleotide with respect to TSS at 0 position in order to retain the GC composition of these regions. Interestingly genomic sequences in the promoter, as well as the non-promoter region, are overall less bendable and more curved than the shuffled sequences. On the other hand, while genomic promoter sequences are less stable than their shuffled counterparts, the flanking genomic sequences are more stable. The loss of special structural features in shuffled sequences suggests that these features arise due to specific base sequence patterns.Similar structural profiles were observed for internal promoters, antisense promoters and non-coding RNA gene promoters (Fig. 2). Stability profiles show sharp low stability peaks in the case of internal, antisense and non-coding RNA promoters as compared with primary promoters across all organisms. Bendability and curvature profiles also show distinct features in their promoter regions, but they are less prominent for these categories of promoters as compared with primary promoters. Base composition analysis shows that primary category of promoters (-100 to 0 nucleotide with respect to TSS at 0) show preference for several AT rich tetramers as compared with background region (-500 to +500 nucleotide with respect to TSS at 0) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Internal and antisense categories of promoters show less preference for AT rich tetramers and TATA sequence motifs as compared with primary and non-coding RNA promoters. Core promoter region (-35 and -10 element) shows poor sequence conservation even for promoters associated with primary category of TSSs (Supplementary Fig. S2) and becomes poorer for internal and antisense categories of promoters as compared with the primary category across the six different model organisms with varying genomic GC content. Interestingly no sequence motif signature was observed in their -35 region, while a secondary low stability peak was observed in the same region for primary category of TSSs across the organisms. The weak preference for AT rich tetramers and poor sequence motif conservation in core promoter elements (-35 and -10 elements) makes it difficult to predict these promoters by sequence motif based approaches.

Two cycles of predictions were performed using 75 and 100 nucleotides window size (using two different sets of cut-off values derived using 75 and 100 nucleotides fragment length for cycle one and two, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity achieved in each cycle, using the four different properties are shown in Figure 3 for all six organisms. Higher specificity was achieved at the cost of sensitivity in the second cycle of prediction, which uses larger fragment length of DNA sequence and most importantly, it was found to be valid for all structural features in primary category of promoters. Bendability (DNase I sensitivity model) and curvature were found to be equally sensitive but less specific in nature as compared with stability in all six model organisms.

Similarly, bendability (both models DNase I sensitivity and NPP) and curvature features were found to give high precision values in cycle two as compared with cycle one. Both prediction cycles were found to give an almost similar balanced-accuracy (BA), which is the mean of TP rate (sensitivity) and TN rate (specificity). Overall cycle one was found to be a better predictor, with better F-score (harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision) values across all the model organisms for all structural features.  Assessment of DNA structural features for their ability to differentiate between promoter and non-promoter sequences in six different model organismsOut of the total test dataset (promoters associated with the primary category of TSS), 1001 nucleotide long sequences with 30–65% GC content were considered. The sequences with promoter predictions falling in the 300 nucleotide region spanning -200 to +100 with respect to TSS at 0 were considered as TP while sequences with predictions falling in the coding region +200 to + 500 with respect to TSS were labelled as FP. Evaluation parameters precision (Prec.), BA and F-score were calculated using formulas explained in the ‘Material and methods’ section.

Evaluation parameters precision (Prec.), BA and F-score were calculated using formulas explained in the ‘Material and methods’ section.We categorized the predicted promoters based on the function performed by the associated gene, according to the Cluster of Orthologous Groups information obtained from NCBI (Supplementary Table S1). Promoters associated with genes involved in information storage and processing function (transcription, translation and replication), which are constitutively expressed in the cell are annotated well across the six different organisms. However, sensitivity values for an individual structural feature vary among the organisms, e.g. promoters associated with genes which have a role in replication and repair exhibit sensitivity values (using stability) ranging from a low of 38% for Synechocystis to a high of 72% for Klebsiella. Promoters of genes involved in cellular processing and cell signaling are relatively less well annotated. Genes involved in metabolism function show variation in the sensitivity values for different gene families. General function genes (which are based on prediction only) also get annotated reliably in all six prokaryotic organisms. Genes which are not characterized or with unknown function are found to be relatively less annotated in all organisms. Hence, prediction results suggest that structural features in the promoter regions are related to the function associated with the gene.Internal, antisense and non-coding RNA promoters were also predicted using the cut-off values derived from primary promoter sequences. Higher sensitivity values were obtained in the first cycle of prediction as compared with the second cycle. Bendability (both by DNase I sensitivity and NPP model) and curvature were found to be more sensitive for these categories of promoters, as compared with stability. The reduction in the sensitivity values for stability feature for internal and antisense promoters was due to sharp and narrow low stability peak in the AFE profile (Fig. 2). The narrower peaks can be attributed to these categories of promoters being present within the coding region while primary promoters are mostly present in the relatively AT rich intergenic region upstream of TSS.3.3 Promoter annotation using combination of structural featuresAlthough stability was found to be the most distinctive feature, differentiating the promoter from the flanking region for a given genomic sequence, it was able to achieve maximum 81% sensitivity for primary category of promoters in Klebsiella, in cycle one prediction (Fig. 3). In order to assess the number of promoter sequences that do not get identified by any structural feature, we applied a combinatorial approach. It was found that ˜95% primary category of promoter sequences get identified by at least one structural feature. Similar sensitivity values are obtained from a combinatorial approach using DNase I sensitivity and NPP models for bendability (as seen in Fig. 4). Likewise internal and antisense categories of promoters achieve ˜85 and ˜89% sensitivity, respectively. Further analysis of promoter prediction in the different categories of transcripts revealed several interesting facts. For example, ˜50% of the primary category of promoter sequences are characterized by all three structural features, viz. stability, bendability and curvature, while remaining promoter sequences lack either one or two structural features (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, majority of internal and antisense categories of promoters are characterized by bendability and curvature while promoters associated with non-coding RNA genes are similar to primary category of promoters (Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggests that the promoter sequences which occur in the coding region, such as internal and antisense promoters, are distinguishable by different structural features, when compared with the primary and non-coding RNA promoter sequences, which are present in the intergenic region.

For example DNA duplex has to be less stable to facilitate easier melting in the vicinity of the TSS during transcription initiation. Hence, in order to study the promoter architecture in terms of structural features, we characterized these features in two classes of promoters, viz. those associated with genes exhibiting high and low gene expression. Gene expression data was obtained from GEO, NCBI expression microarray profiling. The structural properties (stability, bendability and curvature) in the promoter regions associated with high gene expression are found to be more pronounced as compared with low gene expression. A violin plot drawn from the values of DNA structural features underscores the difference in the distribution of probability densities between the promoters associated with high and low expression categories of genes (Fig. 5). The promoters of highly expressed genes were less stable, less bendable and more curved as compared with promoters of lowly expressed genes. One-sided two sample KS test was performed to check if the difference in feature value between the two classes is significant enough for them to be compared (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly curvature was found to be the only consistent property demarcating promoters from high and low gene expression classes, across all organisms, while other properties show one or more exceptions in case of Synechocystis, Salmonella and Klebsiella.

Plots with shaded background indicate the cases which failed to reject the null hypothesis using two sample KS test at the level of significance of P = 0.01.Trinucleotide preference analysis of the whole promoter region (UP elements and core promoter region) was performed in order to understand the underlying difference in terms of oligonucleotide composition. It showed that overall high expression genes favor rigid and minor groove facing histone preferring trimers, such as AAA/TTT and AAT/ATT while flexible or major groove facing histone preferring trinucleotides like GCC/GGC are less preferred (Supplementary Fig. S5). Preference for AAA/TTT reduces gradually as genomic GC% increases.Promoter prediction using DNA structural features shows that sensitivity for promoters associated with high gene expression is higher as compared with the low gene expression (Fig. 6). Interestingly it was found that promoters associated with higher gene expression are better characterized (higher sensitivity) by a combination of all structural features (stability, bendability and curvature) as compared with those associated with low gene expression. Correspondingly, promoters for low gene expression category are less likely to be predicted as compared with the high gene expression category. Moreover, this trend is present across organisms with varying genomic GC content.

ConclusionDNA sequence dependent structural properties like duplex stability, protein induced bendability and intrinsic curvature are well studied and physiologically relevant properties for the promoter region. Since there is very weak sequence (tetramer) preference and poor sequence motif conservation in the internal and antisense promoters as compared with primary promoters, it is very difficult to identify them using sequence based approaches. Characteristic structural features, on the other hand, are present in the promoter regions of all categories of promoters identified in prokaryotic transcriptomes. Significantly, these properties are not organism specific in nature. However, promoters associated with primary, internal, antisense and non-coding RNA category of transcripts show differences in the profiles of their structural properties. In particular, internal and antisense categories of promoters show distinctly different structural feature profiles as compared with the primary category of promoters. Since a single feature does not predict all promoters, transcriptome can be better annotated using a combinatorial approach. Annotation and analysis of promoters corresponding to the different transcripts present in the transcriptome can provide a better understanding of the complexity involved in gene regulation process. Finally, the promoter DNA structural features show good correlation with the level of expression of the associated gene. Hence by examining structural features associated with promoter regions, one can possibly estimate the level of gene expression.M.B. is the recipient of J. C.

IntroductionHelicobacter pylori infects approximately half the world’s population. It is a Gram-negative microaerophilic pathogen that persistently colonises the human stomach. The bacterium is associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulceration, and less commonly, with gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.1,2 Hence, the organism was classified as a class 1 carcinogen by World Health Organisation in 1994.3Population analysis of H. pylori isolates from different geographical origins has revealed a high degree of genetic diversity within the species. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis has shown that identical alleles are extremely rare in H. pylori even when sampling a large population of the same geographical origin.4 This indicates that H. pylori is able to adapt to a new or rapidly changing environment by undergoing continuous genetic modification. Greater understanding of these modifications and the mechanisms by which they arise will improve the knowledge base from which we may develop new therapeutic targets.The high genetic variation in H. pylori appears to be generated through intragenic and intergenic recombinations, plus extensive mutations attributed to the lack of a nucleotide mismatch repair system, such as that provided in other bacteria by MutS, MutH and MutL.5 There are two families of MutS homologues: MutS1 and MutS2. The MutS1 family includes Escherichia coli MutS, which plays a role in post-replication mismatch repair. In the H. pylori genome, HP0621, a member of the MutS2 family has been identified. However, rather than participating in mismatch repairing, it suppresses homeologous recombination mediated by RecA.6,7 Compared to E. coli, H. pylori is also missing a number of elements responsible for direct repair of DNA damage such as Ada methyltransferase, AlkB oxidative demethylase and Phr/Spl photolyase, as well as several gylcosylases and endonucleases involved in base excision repair including MutM, Tag, AlkA, Mpg, YgjF, Nei and Nfo.8 On the other hand, the presence of a DNA polymerase I that lacks proof-reading activity also contributes to the generation of genomic plasticity in H. pylori.9Rapid phenotype switching is another strategy that enables pathogens to survive in diverse hostile environments and to establish persistent infections in novel hosts. Phenotypic switching can be achieved by epigenetic events, such as DNA methylation and gene silencing mediated by non-coding RNAs. It can also occur via phase-variation-associated genetic modifications, such as site-specific recombination, inversion of promoter elements, insertional inactivation mediated by insertion sequences and slipped-strand mispairing of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) including homopolymeric tracts.10,11Changes in homopolymeric tract length located in coding sequences are known to generate frameshift errors and hence result in expression of truncated and often non-functional proteins.12 While intragenic homopolymeric tract alterations turn protein expression on or off, intergenic variations may alter mRNA level to fine-tune protein expression. This has recently been shown in the adhesin-encoding gene sabA of H. pylori. Altering the length of a poly(T) tract found adjacent to its -35 promoter region changes the mRNA transcript and protein expression levels, as well as the binding to the sialyl Lex receptor.13To date, relatively little is known about H. pylori genetic adaptation in response to selective pressures from its host. It is important to identify these adaptive mutations to provide deeper insights into the exact mechanisms underlying H. pylori infection. Although H. pylori is highly adapted to the human gastric mucosa environment, several animal models comprising mice, gerbils and non-human primates have been used to advance understanding of H. pylori colonisation and pathogenesis.14–16 Whilst experimental studies in humans would be most likely to reveal clinically relevant details, studies in animal models are ethically superior to human challenge experiments, and can still tell us much about the genomic changes associated with host adaptation.Here, we report a follow-up investigation to our previously announced complete genomes of the H. pylori clinical strain UM032 and its mice-adapted derivatives designated 298 and 299. These were sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences RS sequencing technology using the C2 chemistry.17 PacBio RS sequencing technology produces extraordinarily long reads, thus increasing the likelihood of acquiring a complete genome sequence. As opposed to the current C5 chemistry, high error rates were observed in sequencing data generated using the earlier C2 chemistry.18 Therefore, for this study all three strains were also subjected to whole-genome sequencing using Illumina’s MiSeq platform. Hence, the comparative data presented here provide comprehensive information about the changes associated with host change in H. pylori. We reveal H. pylori genetic elements potentially required for host-adaptation and epigenetic regulation of gene expression mediated by homopolymeric tracts present both in the upstream regions of coding sequences, within or in close proximity to the promoter elements, and within the coding sequences.2. Methods2.1. Bacterial strainsThe acquisition of H. pylori clinical strain UM032 and its mice-adapted derivatives, designated 298 and 299 respectively, was as previously described.172.2. Illumina library preparation and sequencingPreparation of MiSeq library was performed using Illumina Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described with minor modifications.19 In brief, 1 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented in 5 µl of Amplicon Tagment Mix and 10 µl of Tagment DNA buffer. Tagmentation reaction was performed by incubation at 55 °C for 5 min followed by neutralisation with 5 µl of Neutralise Tagment Buffer for 5 min. Tagmented DNA (25 µl) was indexed in a 50 µl limited-cycle PCR (12 cycles) as outlined in the Nextera XT protocol and subsequently purified using 25 µl of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc, Australia). The fragment size distribution of the purified DNA was analysed utilising a 2100 Bioanalyser with a High Sensitivity DNA assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA libraries were adjusted to 2 nM, pooled in equal volumes and then denatured with 0.2 N NaOH according to the Nextera protocol. The libraries were sequenced using 2 × 300 paired-end protocols on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 for 600 cycles).2.3. Genome correctionThe generated MiSeq data were used for correction of homopolynucleotide errors present in the previously published H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 complete genomes generated using PacBio C2 chemistry. In brief, MiSeq raw reads were mapped against the complete genome using the Geneious R7 read mapper with the medium sensitivity option.20 Variants were subsequently called using the following parameters: minimum coverage = 10 and minimum variant frequency = 0.7. Reported errors in each reference genome sequence were corrected.2.4. Genome annotationInitially, the genome sequences were automatically annotated using the RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) pipeline.21 In addition to Glimmer (version 3.02) used in the pipeline, additional ORF prediction was performed using GeneMarkS (version 4.7a) and Prodigal (version 2.60).22–24 By majority ruling, the predicted start codons of ORFs predicted from multiple annotation engines were manually curated to enhance start codon accuracy. Genome annotations were further compared against gene sequences from 45 completely sequenced publicly available H. pylori genomes to allow identification of pseudogenes. In our context, a pseudogene can be a non-functional DNA sequence with a frameshift or premature stop codon, a sequence homologous to a protein-coding gene but without ORF or a full-length reference gene broken into two or more adjacent ORFs. Our manually curated genome annotations are available in Supplementary Tables S1–S3. NCBI accession numbers of 45 public genomes used for genome annotation comparison are as follows: 35A (NC_017360), 51 (NC_017382), 52 (NC_017354), 83 (NC_017375), 908 (NC_017357), 2017 (NC_017374), 2018 (NC_017381), 26695 (NC_000915), Aklavik86 (NC_019563), Aklavik117 (NC_019560), B8 (NC_014256), B38 (NC_012973), BM012A (NC_022886), BM012S (NC_022911), Cuz20 (NC_017358), ELS37 (NC_017063), F16 (NC_017368), F30 (NC_017365), F32 (NC_017366), F57 (NC_017367), G27 (NC_011333), Gambia94/24 (NC_017371), HPAG1 (NC_008086), HUP-B14 (NC_017733), India7 (NC_017372), J99 (NC_000921), Lithuania75 (NC_017362), OK113 (NC_020508), OK310 (NC_020509), P12 (NC_011498), PeCan4 (NC_014555), PeCan18 (NC_017742), Puno120 (NC_017378), Puno135 (NC_017379), Sat464 (NC_017359), Shi112 (NC_017741), Shi169 (NC_017740), Shi417 (NC_017739), Shi470 (NC_010698), SJM180 (NC_014560), SNT49 (NC_017376), SouthAfrica7 (NC_017361), SouthAfrica20 (NC_022130), v225d (NC_017355) and XZ274 (NC_017926).2.5. In silico genome analysisThe revised genome sequences of H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 were compared pairwise using progressiveMauve (version 2.3.1), followed by variants calling using Geneious R7.252.6. COG functional analysisCOG of H. pylori UM032 genes with amino acid substitutions detected in the mice-adapted strains 298 and 299 was annotated by rpsblast.262.7. Western immunodetectionWhole cell lysates were prepared from bacterial cells standardised to OD600 of 10. For each blot, 10 µl of sample was used for SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to an Immobilon®-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck Millipore). Blood group antigen-binding adhesin A (BabA) detected with polyclonal antibody, with detection by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualization by chemiluminescent signal using Clarity™ Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) on a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imaging system. H. pylori UreB was detected using rabbit anti-urease B polyclonal antibodies purchased from Sigma Aldrich. H. pylori Le antigen phenotypes were determined using monoclonal antibodies (Abcam) to Lea, Leb, Lex, or Ley. Bound immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma Aldrich) against IgM or IgG.2.8. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)Bacterial total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin® RNA (Macherey-Nagel). After RNA quantification, cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of RNA in a 20 µl reverse transcription reaction using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR analysis was subsequently performed in 20 µl reactions in 96-well plates using cDNA from 20 ng RNA as template, LuminoCt® SYBR® Green qPCR ReadyMixTM (Sigma Aldrich) and the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science). Cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, 56 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Following each run a melting curve analysis was performed in which the reactions were heated slowly from 55 °C to 95 °C (0.1 °C/s). The relative expression of each target gene was calculated using the 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen27, after normalisation against the gyrA reference gene. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S4. 2.9. Statistical analysisPaired Student’s t-test was used to test for differences in relative quantification of gene expression. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.2.10. Genome sequence updateThe updated complete genomes of UM032, 298 and 299 are available in GenBank under the original accession numbers: NC_021215.3 (GI:685455742), NC_021882.2 (GI:687961717) and NC_021216.3 (GI:685456130).3. Results and discussion3.1. Global pairwise alignment of previously published UM032, 298 and 299 genomes revealed sequence duplications and homopolymeric tract errorsGenomic rearrangement via intragenic recombination is a powerful strategy of gene regulation employed by H. pylori to aid in adaption to host niches and successful colonisation of the gastric mucosa. To investigate the occurrence of chromosomal shuffling events in the mice-adapted UM032 derivatives, progressive Mauve alignment was performed after assigning a common starting point for all three genomes. No genomic rearrangement was observed. However, each genome was shown to harbour an insertion of a large DNA fragment, which measured 5659 bp, 9667 bp and 6578 bp in UM032, 298 and 299, respectively (Fig. 1). BLASTN search demonstrated that each fragment could be further divided into two different regions that closely resemble the neighbouring sequences as depicted in Figure 2. These insertions are probably due to misassembly of the original PacBio sequences, resulting in false segmental duplications.

The ' character indicates the erroneous overlaps at each end of the original published contig.By using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP), a total of 167 pseudogenes have previously been annotated in UM032 genome compared to 29 in 298 and 25 in 299.17 We performed BLASTN pairwise alignment of the pseudogenes in UM032 against their counterparts in 298 and 299, of which 146 were shown to have deletions associated with homopolymeric sequences in 298 and 299 (Supplementary Table S5), resulting in restoration of correct reading frame and thus the functional coding sequence (CDS). The presence of homopolymeric tracts in H. pylori is known to play an essential role in phase variation through slipped-strand mispairing, leading to differential antigenic expression that facilitates host-adaptation and persistent colonisation.13 However, it is intriguing to observe such overwhelming mutational bias towards deletion in both 298 and 299 genomes, implying that there is potential sequencing and/or de novo assembly error in the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP) workflow (http://pacbiodevnet.com/) available in Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Analysis v2.0. Sanger sequencing was performed to verify the length of the homopolymeric tract in which variation occurs in 7 randomly chosen UM032 pseudogenes and their functional counterparts. Homopolymer insertion errors detected in selected UM032 pseudogenes could be due to sequencing errors in the original genomes. 3.2. Whole genome resequencing using MiSeqTo remove homopolymer-length sequencing errors and duplications in the original sequences, all three genomes were resequenced using the MiSeq platform with at least 100× sequencing depth. The reads generated were subsequently mapped to the corresponding reference genome as described in Materials and Methods.The analysis of read depth can be a useful approach to check for duplications. It is expected that the read depth at any location is equal to the global average coverage, given that the sequencing reads are randomly distributed across a genome. An average read depth of 135x, 122x and 174x, respectively, was determined for UM032, 298 and 299. The erroneously duplicated sequences, however, had substantially lower read depth than the global read depth and compared to that of the closely resembled upstream and downstream sequences, as summarised in Table 1, indicating they were misassembled and incorrectly present in two copies. The false duplication in each genome was therefore removed. This was followed by remapping of the sequencing reads to determine and compare the reads ratio (regional read depth divided by global read depth) of the previously duplicated sequences and their counterparts across all three genomes. These reads ratios are expected to be comparable among each other. As anticipated, the removal of duplication restored the reads ratio of these now single-copy sequences, as shown in Table 2. It is also now clear that what seemed to be the duplicated sequences are in fact near identical overlaps found at each end of the contig, which failed to be removed during sequence assembly to generate accurate circular consensus DNA sequence.

Surprisingly, there were significantly less errors in both 298 and 299 genomes, only seven and three variants being detected, respectively. Nonetheless, the reported errors, including all additional nucleotides found in the homopolymeric tracts, were corrected and the genomes were reannotated as stated in Methods. Table 3 summarises the general features of all three genomes, prior to and after the sequence error correction and reannotation. It is important to highlight that a number of false pseudogene candidates have been efficiently removed, especially in UM032, in which the number has been significantly reduced from 167 to 42, improving the reliability of comparative analysis. General features of pre- and post-correction H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 genomesGeneral features of pre- and post-correction H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 genomes3.3. Whole genome comparisons of revised H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299The revised complete genome sequences of H. pylori clinical isolate UM032 and its mice-adapted derivatives 298 and 299 were compared against each other. A pairwise global alignment of the genome of UM032 with that of 298 and 299 revealed 99.9% identity at the nucleotide level. The 298 strain contained 89 variants relative to strain UM032, of which 32 were indels and the remaining were substitution mutations including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Supplementary Table S7). Nine indels affected ORFs. In addition to tandem repeats or homopolymeric tracts and additions or deletions to the 5’ or 3’ ends of ORFs, an insertion has introduced a complete ORF, which is annotated as UM298_1363 encoding a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis protein. Amongst the 57 substitutions detected, 16 were intergenic and 41 were located in protein coding sequences. Only 12 of the latter resulted in amino acid changes and the remaining were synonymous substitutions. Relative to 298, only two tandem repeat insertions and 1 deletion within a homopolymeric tract were identified in 299, of which the latter restores an open reading frame designated UM299_0755 (Supplementary Table S8). We further performed a COG (clusters of orthologous groups) analysis on genes with non-synonymous changes (Table 4). Genes without an inferred COG category were also analysed. Together it was shown that genes encoding for outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins are enriched for substitution mutations. COG analysis of UM032 genes with non-synonymous substitutions in its mice-adapted derivativesCOG analysis of UM032 genes with non-synonymous substitutions in its mice-adapted derivativesTaken together, our data have demonstrated an outburst of mutations when UM032 encounters a new host environment. The second round of mice infection using the mice-adapted strain 298 however resulted only in slight genomic alterations in the output strain 299, signifying that the bacterium has undergone sufficient genomic adaptations to establish a chronic infection. It is important to mention that our findings contrast the experimental outcome of Linz et al. who conducted a macaque infection study using the previously macaque-adapted H. pylori strain J166.28 In their study, J166output strains accumulated up to 12 SNPs within 1 week post infection. Our output strain 299, however, showed no SNPs 2 weeks after the infection. This suggests that there was a lack of acute inflammatory response, perhaps due to less variability between the gastric environments of mice, than between those of individual macaques.Of note is that an amino acid change was detected in UM298_1343 relative to UM032_1343. This protein is known as the antigenic membrane-associated tumour necrosis factor a-inducing protein. The change replaces the isoleucine at position 111 for valine. Previous studies have shown that H. pylori TNFa-inducing protein is able to induce interleukin-1a, TNFa, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1a productions in monocytes, as well as tumorigenesis in nude mice implanted with transfected Bhas 42 cells.29,303.4. Intragenomic recombination between babA and babBAmong 65 nucleotide substitutions detected in 298 and 299 relative to UM032, 24 were observed within ORF UM032_1223, which was identified as the babA gene by BLASTN search against the Helicobacter group in NCBI database. Such a high number of mutations could reflect the strong selective pressure for rapid adjustment of BabA-mediated adhesion to facilitate adaptation and colonisation of different host gastric niche. However, these mutations were all synonymous substitutions. Furthermore, rather than being arbitrarily distributed across the 2226 bp gene, they were confined within the C-terminal region, prompting us to investigate whether the mutations could arise due to a recombination event.Paralogous to babA are both babB and babC genes. Due to their extensive sequence identity at 5’ and 3’ regions, intragenomic recombination can occur within the babABC family, resulting in phenotypic change of Lewis b antigen binding capacity.31–34 The bab genes reside in three different chromosomal locations, downstream of the hypD gene (locus A), the rpsR gene (locus B) and hp0318 in H. pylori 26695 (locus C), respectively.31,35 Nevertheless not all bab genes are present within each H. pylori strain. There are some strains which do not possess the babA or babC gene and some harbour two copies of babA or babB gene.36,37 There has also been an interesting observation by Kawai et al. that the babC locus, corresponding to hp0317 in H. pylori 26695, is empty in all the hpEastAsia strains as a result of reductive evolution in the outer membrane protein families.38To test for a recombination event, we performed a BLASTN search of the C-terminal sequence fragment in UM032 genome and identified a complete match in the C-terminal region of a silent babB locus designated UM032_0908. Furthermore, pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of UM032 babA and babB, and 298 babA, along with their downstream sequence indicated the presence of a double crossover recombination event as highlighted in Fig. 3. As there is no conversion of any amino acid residue, no functional change is deduced. It is however unclear whether the synonymous mutations may affect the in vivo translational speed and thus the expression of BabA in strains 298 and 299. To evaluate the possible translational outcome of these synonymous changes in babA, we compared the codon usage of the babA genes to the codon usage of highly expressed genes, specifically the ribosomal genes and the elongation factors, in the measurement of codon adaptation index (CAI) computed using EMBOSS CAI application.39 The UM032 babA gene achieved a CAI score of 0.693, compared to a slightly lower value of 0.689 in the recombined version found in 298 and 299. Under such condition, the latter is less optimally encoded, by 0.4%, suggesting that there would only be marginal effect on protein expression levels.

Mutations in LPS biosynthesis genesAmong the 89 total variants identified in 298 relative to UM032, 10 were located in two genes designated UM298_1086 and UM298_1395. There is no genotypic difference present in these genes between strains 298 and 299. BLASTN comparison revealed that both genes encode for fucosyltranferase (FucT) that plays a substantial role in the synthesis of Lewis (Le) antigens of which the former gene product exhibits 75.9% amino acid sequence identity to HP0651 (FutB) whilst the latter harbours 78.3% identical amino acids to that of HP0379 (FutA). In H. pylori genomes, there are three phase-variable FucT-encoding genes, termed futA, futB and futC. FutA and FutB, both are paralogous and can fucosylate either Lec antigen (type I carbohydrate backbone) in a a-(1,4) linkage to generate Lea antigen, and/or N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc) (type II carbohydrate backbone) in a a-(1,3) linkage to create Lex antigen.40–42 Both Lea and Lex antigens can be further fucosylated by FutC in a a-(1,2) manner to create difucoslylated Leb or Ley (Fig. 5).43In addition to the nucleotide variations found in FucT encoding genes, a 1-kb insertion was identified upstream of the UM032_1363 counterpart in both the 298 and the 299 genomes, designated UM298_1364 and UM299_1364 respectively. UM032_1363 shares approximately 80% nucleotide sequence identity with HP0619 in H. pylori strain 26695, and jhp0563 in H. pylori strain J99. Jhp0563 is a ß-(1,3)galT gene with a product essential for the expression of Lec.44 The upstream homologous glycosyltransferase-encoding gene jhp0562, is however absent in several H. pylori strains including 26695.45 Due to a high degree of shared nucleotide sequence identity, it has been demonstrated that both jhp0562 and ß-(1,3)galT genes can undergo intragenic recombination within a single strain to generate functional chimeric alleles. This explains why certain strains do not possess a jhp0562 allele.45 Interestingly, the 1-kb insertion has introduced a gene which is 90.7% similar to jhp0562 in the mice-derivative strains, designated 298_1363 and 299_1363 respectively. In this study, the mice were inoculated intragastrically with a pool consisting of 12 H. pylori clinical strains including UM032. The jhp0562-like allele was probably acquired by homologous recombination from one of the other strains inoculated.To further examine how the genotypic changes above would affect Le antigen phenotypic expression, immunoblots were performed on proteinase K-treated whole cell lysates with antibodies detecting Lea, Leb, Lex and Ley (Fig. 4). All three strains reacted with the Leb antibody but differed in the sizes of decorated O-antigen chains. The immunoblot experiments also detected strong Ley expression in strains 298 and 299. However, only a trace level of Ley was detected in input strain UM032. Figure 5 shows the Le antigen synthesis model in UM032 with all anticipated glycosyltransferase-encoding genes listed. The detection of both Leb and Ley indicates the presence of the a-1,2-fucosylation process, which is expected since all three strains had an identical in-frame futC gene. Last but not least, none of these strains revealed any detectable levels of Lea and Lex (data not shown), suggesting that there is a relatively high activity of FutC in these strains, leading to complete a-1,2-fucosylation of these substrates once presented. In addition, terminal fucosylation could have masked internal Lea or Lex and therefore hindered antibody detection.

GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; LacNAc, N-acetyl-D-lactosamine.The minute expression of Ley in strain UM032 might be either due to low level of endogenous a-1,3-FucT activity or a low LacNAc content and thus a reduced expression of Lex. In strain UM032, the futA gene (UM032_1394) is switched off because its intragenic poly(C) tract located near the ATG start codon lacks one nucleotide, resulting in out-of-frame translation. The futB gene, by contrast, is in-frame, yielding correct full-length FucT enzyme in each strain. Given that FutA is inactive, the presence of both Leb and Ley in strain UM032 indicates that its FutB enzyme, encoded by UM032_1086, must contain both a-1,3 and a-1,4 properties. This is in agreement with our prediction by pairwise comparison that UM032_1086 displays extensive amino acid identity of 93.1% with a previously documented a-1,3/4-FucT found in H. pylori strain UA948 (GenBank accession number AF194963) (Table 5).40,46Amino acid sequence identities between H. pylori fucosyltransferasesThe enzymatic activity is predicted based on amino acid sequence comparison.Amino acid sequence identities between H. pylori fucosyltransferasesThe enzymatic activity is predicted based on amino acid sequence comparison.However, it has been demonstrated that UA948FucT exhibits a greater than 5-fold affinity towards the type II chain precursor to generate Lex. This does not support the hypothesis that a low level of a-1,3 activity is present within strain UM032. We next tested whether the minor changes in the amino acid composition could have altered the acceptor substrate affinity to make UM032_1086 favour the type I over the type II chain. To address this question, we performed protein structure modelling comparing both UA948FucT and UM032_1086. Figure 6 shows the models of UA948FucT and UM032_1086, each model based on the crystal structure of uncomplexed FucT (PDB ID: 2NZW). The catalytic sites accounting for interaction with the donor substrate, GDP-fucose, are highlighted. While it is accepted that structure modelling can be insensitive to minor amino acid changes, no structural differences were observed between the two models. Thus, it seems unlikely that there is distinct acceptor substrate specificity between UA948FucT and UM032_1086.

The catalytic sites accounting for interaction with the donor substrate, GDP-fucose, are highlighted.An alternative hypothesis is that the amount of LacNAc is inherently low within the UM032 strain, permitting FutB to utilise Lec for Lea synthesis once the LacNAc reservoir is depleted. To enhance LacNAc production and thus Ley expression in strains 298 and 299, an additional copy of gylcosyltransferase gene must be present. This is consistent with the acquisition of a jhp0562-like allele in both strains. jhp0562 has been demonstrated in previous mutagenesis and complementation studies as an essential component in both type I and type II Le synthesis pathways.45 Despite displaying only 21% nucleotide sequence similarity to known ß-(1,4)galT genes including jhp0765 and HP0826, our findings offer further support for the idea that the product of this acquired jhp0562-like allele contains ß-1,4-galactosyltransferase activity for the conversion of N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlyNAc) to LacNAc. Subsequently the expression of full-length FutA, which is expected to exhibit similar functions to that of FutB by conserving approximately 93.4% amino acids, in strains 298 and 299, provides additional a-1,3 enzymatic activity to produce Lex that is immediately converted into Ley by FutC.The occurrence of genotypic and phenotypic changes in Le antigens in strain 298 relative to the input strain UM032, but not between strains 298 and 299, reflects an initial event of host-driven Le antigen expression adaptation taking place in H. pylori upon its first encounter to a new host species. This would aid the bacterium in establishment of long-term colonisation. The acquisition of jhp0562-like allele further suggests that the product of this non-phase-variable allele may further confer an increase in competitive advantage among H. pylori strains.3.6. Intergenic homopolymeric tract length alterations affect gene expressionIn this study, a number of intragenic and intergenic homopolymeric tract length changes were detected in strains 298 and 299 (Tables 6 and 7). In order to verify if these variations in intergenic homopolymeric tract lengths influence the expression of adjacent genes, we performed qRT-PCR analysis to better understand how these transcriptional changes, if any, can possibly facilitate novel host colonisation. Data are shown as fold change relative to the transcriptional level of each corresponding gene in strain UM032, as depicted in Figure 7. Among nine tested gene candidates, five were significantly greater than four-fold down-regulated, including UM032_0212 (hypothetical protein), UM032_0548 (HopD), UM032_0781 (biotin synthase), UM032_0908 (BabB) and UM032_1223 (BabA). A less than two-fold change was observed between UM032_0213 (CTP synthase) and its counterparts. No amplification was detected for UM032_0025, UM032_0547 and UM032_1372 (data not shown), suggesting that these genes were either not expressed or were expressed at very low levels.

However, UM032_0212 transcription was significantly down-regulated at the poly(A) tract positioned 3 nucleotides upstream of the -35 element thatwas altered in length. The latter result was consistent with the findings of Åberg et al. that variation in the length of homopolymeric tracts located adjacent to the -35 element modulates promoter activity by changing local DNA structure and thereby binding of the RNA polymerase.13 Similarly, transcriptional activity was also reduced in both outer membrane protein-encoding UM032_0548 and UM32_0908 as the poly(T) tract situated ~20 nucleotides upstream of each -35 element was reduced by single base pair in both strains 298 and 299. This indicates that regulation via variation in homopolymeric tract is a fairly general mechanism in H. pylori.On the other hand, BabA-encoding UM032_1223 had an altered poly(A) tract located between the -35 and -10 elements. A Western immunoblot was further conducted using anti-BabA antibody and as expected, BabA expression was nearly lost in strains 298 and 299 (Fig. 8). We also performed another Western analysis with commercial polyclonal antibody against H. pylori urease B (UreB) to demonstrate that comparable amounts of proteins are loaded in each lane (Fig. 9). It has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies that variation in the distance between these two consensus elements can affect RNA polymerase binding and thus the efficiency of gene transcription.47,48 Last but not least, the altered poly(G) tract of down-regulated UM032_0781 was found to lie more than 150 nucleotides upstream of the -35 region. This is probably due to the presence of an unknown distal negative cis-acting element, similar to that found in the phase variable NadA adhesin of Neisseria meningitides.49Figure 8Open in new tabDownload slideWestern immunodetection of BabA in H. pylori strains UM032, 298 and 299.

Recently, it was reported that enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is able to regulate its adherence to intestinal epithelial cells by sensing surrounding biotin level.50 Upon its arrival in the low-biotin large intestine, EHEC down-regulates the expression of its biotin protein ligase BirA to remove the repression on the global regulator Fur, thereby activating LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) genes to promote bacterial adherence. In H. pylori, both BirA and Fur are also present (designated HP1140 and HP1027 in strain 26695, respectively).51 Nevertheless, it is uncertain in H. pylori if BirA may interact with Fur in a similar paradigm to that of E. coli as it lacks the N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix regulatory domain. It is tempting to hopothesise that the down-regulated expression of biotin synthase could possibly result in low intracellular biotin concentration, thus allowing derepression of Fur by BirA, which in turns activates genes involved in motility and chemotaxis to facilitate host colonisation.52 This warrants further investigation. The down-regulation of outer membrane protein genes, especially babA, however, is thought to increase bacterial dispersion and colonisation by preventing autoaggregation which might occur as a result of binding to LPS Leb antigen.3.7. Concluding remarksWhen H. pylori encounters a hostile foreign environment, the bacterium rapidly adapts to the new environment via a series of genomic alterations. Here, we demonstrated that a host change led to modification of the Lewis antigen profile of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide via acquisition of a jhp0562-like allele. In addition, expression levels of outer membrane proteins including BabA, BabB and HopD changed via altered homopolymeric tract lengths. These observations provide further evidence that rapid changes in membrane associated protein expressions play a major role in the early adaptation of bacterial populations to an individual host and these components are one of the key factors in H. pylori’s success as a pathogen.This project was supported by the University of Malaya-Ministry of Education (UM-MoE) High Impact Research (HIR) grant (reference UM.C/625/1/HIR/MoE/CHAN13/3; Account No. H-50001-A000030), the National Health and Medical Research Council (grant no. 572723), the Vice Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, and the Western Australian Department of Commerce and Department of Health.

IntroductionBitter gourd (Momordica charantia, 2n = 2x = 221) is a dicot vine species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae originating in tropical Asia. Bitter gourd, also known as African cucumber, bitter cucumber, bitter melon, balsam pear, or karela in the region,2,3 is characterized by its warty-skinned fruit and is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The flesh of bitter gourd fruit tastes bitter owing to the presence of the cucurbitacin-like alkaloid, momordicine, and triterpene glycosides. Bitter gourd fruit are rich in vitamin C and phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity.4–7 Additionally, leaf decoction of bitter gourd is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of stomach pain, anemia, malaria, coughs, and fever.8 Recently, several studies have shown its antidiabetic effect in vitro and in vivo.9–11 Therefore, these properties have given the plant a high medicinal value and made it the subject of recent scientific research. Similar to other Cucurbitaceae crops, bitter gourd is a monoecious plant species. However, some gynoecious lines have been found,4 providing useful genetic resources (as maternal plants) in breeding programs for the production of F1 hybrids. Matsumura et al.12 succeeded in genetically mapping the locus responsible for gynoecy and identified restriction-associated DNA tag sequencing (RAD-seq) markers linked to the locus. In Cucumis spp., sex determination has been well studied, and ethylene has been shown to play a key role in its regulation. Genes encoding aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase have been shown to be responsible for gynoecy, unisexual flower development, and andromonoecy in cucumber or melon.13–15 Through silver nitrate mediated inhibition of ethylene, production of female flowers in the gynoecious bitter gourd was obstructed in favor of bisexual flowers, indicating the possible involvement of ethylene in the sex determination. However, because of the limited genome sequence information in comparison to cucumber,16 melon,17 and watermelon,18 the genes underlying sex determination in bitter gourd are yet to be identified.In this study, we determined the whole genome sequence of bitter gourd, which was generated through the Illumina next-generation sequencing platform followed by de novo assembly. Ab initio gene prediction and annotation of predicted genes were also carried out. Based on these assembled genome sequences and gene prediction, the bitter gourd genome was compared with known genome sequences of other Cucurbitaceae species. Additionally, through RAD-seq analysis, a linkage map was constructed onto which the assembled scaffolds were assigned. These results provided a basis for gene identification and DNA marker development in bitter gourd, and a platform for studying evolution in Cucurbitaceae species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA preparationA monoecious inbred line OHB3-1 developed by the Okinawa Prefectural Agricultural Research Center was used for de novo sequencing of the bitter gourd genome. Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using a NucleoSpin Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RAD-seq analysis, two parental bitter gourd lines, OHB61-5 and OHB95-1A, and their F2 progeny12 were used as materials.2.2. Library preparation and sequencingSequencing libraries were prepared from genomic DNA for Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq2500 platforms. A short insert (330 bp) paired-end (PE) library was constructed using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina), which reduced PCR amplification bias in library preparation. Mate-paired (MP) libraries with various insert sizes (2, 4, 6, and 8 kbp) were constructed using the Nextera Mate Pair Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). The PE library was sequenced using MiSeq (2 × 230 bp) and the four MP libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2500 (2 × 100 bp).2.3. Sequence assemblySequence reads in fastq files from MiSeq and HiSeq2500 were quality-filtered by FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). For de novo assembly, sequence reads with a PHRED quality score of = 30 comprising of = 90% of the reads were extracted. After adaptor trimming and removal of reads with inappropriate insert sizes in MP libraries using an in-house pipeline of scripts, qualified reads (Supplementary Table S3) were applied to de novo assembly using ALLPATHS-LG assembler version R4985619 with setting PLOIDY = 2 and HAPLOIDIFY = True. All the constructed scaffold sequences were aligned with each other using BLASTN, and perfectly identical scaffolds to others in entire sequences, were excluded as duplicated scaffolds. In the remaining scaffolds showing similarity to others, when the observed frequency of mismatch and indel sites per 1,000 bases was less than 1 in both aligned scaffold sequences, they were presumed to be allelic.For mitochondrial (Mt) or chloroplast (Cp) genome sequences, PE and MP reads were aligned to 80 and 697 Mt and Cp reference genome sequences in the NCBI database (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) version 0.6.1 with default parameters, respectively. Mapped reads to Mt or Cp reference sequences were extracted from the original fastq files, and applied to the assembly using ALLPATHS-LG as described above.2.4. Gene prediction and annotationGene prediction analysis in the bitter gourd scaffold sequences was carried out using ab initio prediction by FGENESH software ver 3.1.1 (Softberry)20 based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based gene prediction (Supplementary method). For annotating predicted genes, encoded protein sequences were applied to the BLASTP search against the non-redundant (NR) protein database in NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/) and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (http://www.uniprot.org), respectively. As domain searches of encoded proteins of predicted genes, all the amino acid sequences were applied to InterProscan version 5.19-58.0 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) with default settings (Supplementary method). Transposable elements in the predicted genes were identified using TransposonPSI (http://transposonpsi.sourceforge.net/), and only the top hits against individual library searches with default settings were employed for their annotation.2.5. Comparative analysis of genomes among Cucurbitaceae speciesComparison of the bitter gourd genome and other Cucurbitaceae genomes was performed by mapping OHB3-1 scaffold sequences to cucumber (cucumber_ChineseLong_v2_genome, http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi),16 melon (CM3.5.1_pseudomol, https://melonomics.net/),17 and watermelon (WCG_chromosome_v1, http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi)18 genome sequences using SyMap 4.2 (http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap/).212.6. Conserved genes among Cucurbitaceae species and unique genes in bitter gourd genomeBy comparing a list of anchors analyzed by the SyMap program, genes showing conserved synteny among all four Cucurbitaceae species were identified, and applied to phylogenetic analysis using Aminosan22 and RAxML23 as described in Supplementary method.To identify genes showing unique structures in the bitter gourd genome, anchor gene lists in the SyMap analysis were compared in all four Cucurbitaceae species. Unanchored genes to any predicted genes in melon, cucumber, or watermelon genomes, were found. Reversely, conserved (syntenic) genes among melon, cucumber, and watermelon genomes, but not in the bitter gourd genome, were also found. Functional annotation of these selected genes was determined by domain searches of encoded protein sequences using InterProScan as described above.2.7. RAD-seq analysisRAD-seq analysis was performed as described previously.12 Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with AseI restriction endonuclease, and a biotinylated adapter, harboring index sequences, was ligated to the digested DNA fragments. The adapter ligated genomic DNA fragments were then digested with NlaIII restriction endonuclease. Biotinylated fragments were collected using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M270, Thermofisher), and the additional adapter was ligated to the end of the fragments on the magnetic beads. These adapter-ligated fragments on the beads were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were then sequenced using the HiSeq2500 system. From the sequence reads, 80 bp sequences including AseI-recognition sites were extracted as RAD-seq tags. Tag extraction and counting was carried out using CLC Genomics Workbench software (Qiagen).2.8. Reference mapping of RAD-seq tagsTag sequences showing more than 20 counts in either parent line (OHB61-5 or OHB95-1A) were employed in further analysis. These tag sequences (80 bp) were mapped to the scaffold sequences of OHB3-1 as ‘reference sequences’ using BWA version 0.6.1 in DDBJ Read Annotation Pipeline (https://p.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/pipeline/). Procedures for detection of polymorphic or heterozygous loci were described in Supplementary method.2.9. Linkage map developmentAn RAD-seq analysis of 97 F2 plants derived from OHB61-5 and OHB95-1A was carried out as described above. Based on analyzed RAD-seq data in individual F2 plants, genotypes of bi-allelic tags as co-dominant markers were determined following a previously described method.12 Genotyping procedure and a linkage map construction using JoinMap4.1 (Kyazma)24 were described in Supplmentary method.2.10. Comparative analysis of orthologous and paralogous genesHomologues of genes for putative trypsin inhibitor, ribosome inactivating protein, ACC synthase and CmWip1 were identified by BLAST searches against predicted genes in melon, cucumber and watermelon genome. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA7.0.18.25 Detail of analysis was described in Supplementary method.2.11. RT-PCR analysisTotal RNA was extracted from flower buds of bitter gourd plant, and expression of sex determination-related genes was analyzed by RT-PCR as described in Supplementary method.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the bitter gourd genomeIn the current study, a monoecious inbred line (OHB3-1) of bitter gourd was used for genome sequencing using the Illumina platform. Paired-end (PE) and mate-pair (MP; with 2, 4, 6, and 8 kbp inserts) libraries were constructed from genomic DNA and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq2500 DNA sequencer. For PE library development, PCR amplification was avoided and long read sequencing (2×230 bp) was carried out. The total length of the analyzed sequence reads amounted to over 37 Gb (Supplementary Table S3), which was equivalent to approximately 110 times that of the estimated genome size (339 Mb) of bitter gourd,26 representing a sufficient quantity of sequence reads for whole genome assembly. Using these sequence reads, scaffolds were constructed using the ALLPATHS-LG assembler.19 Using BLAST analysis of the assembled scaffolds of each other, six pairs of putative allelic scaffolds (scaffold_617 and 614, 950, and 911, 988 and 901, 699 and 700, 690 and 691, 657 and 604), which contained mismatch and/or indel sites, were found. However, since it was difficult to discriminate between allelic and paralogous sequences in this study, they were included in the draft genome sequence data as independent scaffolds in this study. The total length of the assembled scaffolds was 285.5 Mb, which comprised 1,029 scaffolds (Table 1), corresponding to approximately 84% of the previously estimated genome size.26 The N50 value of these scaffolds was 1.1 Mb, and the longest scaffold sized was over 7 Mb (Table 1). According to previous studies, coverage (%) and N50 values of assembled sequences were 66% and 1.1 Mb in cucumber,16 83% and 4.7 Mb in melon,17 and 83% and 2.3 Mb in watermelon,18 respectively. The present genome assembly of bitter gourd is comparable to the assembly of other cucurbits genomes. However, 15% of the genome was undetermined in the present sequencing analysis. It is possible that the redundant regions of the genome, such as sequences encoding multiple copies of repeats or transposons, interfered with accurate assembly, resulting in shorter assembled scaffolds than the actual complete genome. Among the scaffolds of the OHB3-1 genome, sequences of 94,148 ambiguous degenerate bases (0.03%) were present, possibly owing to heterozygous loci or assembly of redundant regions (data not shown). Summary of assembly results in OHB3-1 genome sequenceSummary of assembly results in OHB3-1 genome sequenceBased on 80 mitochondrial and 697 chloroplast reference genome sequences (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), scaffolds for organelle genome were developed. Scaffold length of the mitochondrial genome was 312,781 bp, and the total length of three scaffolds of the chloroplast genome was 40,659 bp (Table 1). Through the BLAST search, the scaffold sequence of the bitter gourd mitochondrial genome showed high similarity to the watermelon mitochondrial genome sequence (Supplementary Table S4). In the assembled chloroplast genome, scaffold1, scaffold2, and scaffold3 showed the highest similarity to the plastid or chloroplast genome of five-leaf ginseng (Gynostemma pentaphyllum) or cucumber, bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and melon, respectively (Supplementary Table S4).3.2. Gene prediction and transposon explorationGenes in the scaffold sequence of OHB3-1 were inferred by an ab initio prediction using the FGENESH program.20 In total, 45,859 protein-coding genes were found as predicted genes in the OHB3-1 scaffold sequence (Table 2, Supplementary Table S5). Their average number of CDS (coding sequences) per a predicted gene was 4.41 and 8,512 genes constituted only a single CDS. Length of encoded protein in these predicted genes was 331 a.a on average. Transcription start sites and polyadenylation sites in the predicted genes were also found in 45,267 and 45,799 genes, respectively. Gene content in the bitter gourd scaffolds was more than that in the other sequenced Cucurbitaceae genomes (26,682 in cucumber,16 27,427 in melon,17 and 23,440 in watermelon18). This is possibly because transcript information, such as EST (expressed sequence tag) data, was also incorporated in the gene prediction in other Cucurbitaceae genomes. Annotation of predicted genes was performed by a BLASTP search of their encoded protein sequences against non-redundant (NR) protein and UniProt database (Supplementary Table S6). Consequently, encoded proteins of 34,986 and 25,348 predicted genes showed a similarity to the sequences in NR and UniProt databases, respectively. Most of them (25,268 proteins) showed hits to both the NR and UniProt databases, whereas 80 proteins showed only hits to sequences in the UniProt, but not the NR database. In these predicted genes, 8,839 genes encoded putative transposons as determined through TransposonPSI analysis (Supplementary Table S7, Table 2). Sequences of these putative transposons (43,834 kb) accounted for ~15.3% of the total scaffolds of the OHB3-1 genome. The majority (65%) of them belonged to the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, Ty1/copia or Ty3/gypsy. The Ty3/gypsy type was the most abundant (35.6%), covering 5.5% of the total genome. Considering class II transposons (DNA transposons), the CACTA family was the most abundant (24.7%), comprising 3.8% of the total scaffold. For annotating predicted genes, domain searching was also carried out by InterProscan. Domain search results of their encoded protein sequences against Pfam, SMART, ProDom, and PRINTS databases were indicated in Supplementary Table S8. In total, putative encoded proteins for 24,183 genes had any conserved domains (Table 2). Of the unannotated genes by BLAST, conserved domains were found in 23 predicted genes. Consequently, BLAST and conserved domain searching resulted in the annotation of 36,086 predicted genes (~75% of the predicted genes) in total. Summary of predicted genes in bitter gourd (OHB3-1) scaffold sequenceaPrediction of protein-coding genes and their translated sequences were conducted by FGENESH.bEncoded amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were applied to BLASTP searching against non-redundant protein database in NCBI and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database or InterProscan analysis for conserved domain searching.cTransposable elements in the predicted genes were surveyed by TranposonPSI.Summary of predicted genes in bitter gourd (OHB3-1) scaffold sequenceaPrediction of protein-coding genes and their translated sequences were conducted by FGENESH.bEncoded amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were applied to BLASTP searching against non-redundant protein database in NCBI and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database or InterProscan analysis for conserved domain searching.cTransposable elements in the predicted genes were surveyed by TranposonPSI.3.3. Similarity of genome sequences in bitter gourd with Cucurbitaceae speciesA comparison of the bitter gourd genome with those of other Cucurbitaceae crops was performed by synteny mapping of the OHB3-1 scaffolds (285.5 Mb) against pseudomolecule sequences of cucumber, melon and watermelon using the SyMap 4.2 program.21 In this analysis, genome or scaffold sequences of two species were aligned and ‘anchors’, which allowed the connection of two genomes, were determined by filtering based on annotated gene (predicted gene) information. Synteny blocks were defined as regions consisting of more than seven anchors between two species. Synteny blocks against the bitter gourd scaffolds covered 80–90% of each cucurbit genome sequence (Supplementary Table S9). In the watermelon genome, a few synteny blocks of a long length (>10 Mb) were observed, whereas only short (<1 Mb) fragmented blocks were mapped in the melon and cucumber genomes (Supplementary Table S9, Supplementary Figs S1–S3), implying relative structural similarities between the bitter gourd and watermelon. In the SyMap analysis, conserved genes connected between the bitter gourd scaffold and other cucurbit genomes were identified as anchors. In the bitter gourd predicted genes, 16,820, 16,063, and 16,083 genes were defined as anchors (Supplementary Table S10), which corresponded to genes in the watermelon, melon, and cucumber genome, respectively, and 14,775 loci presumed to be conserved in all compared Cucurbitaceae species. Of the genes at these loci, multiplicated (redundant) genes in each genome or scaffold sequences were eliminated, and 69 loci were defined as unique in each cucurbit genome and conserved among all four species (Supplementary Table S11). Based on the alignment of encoded amino acid sequences of these orthologous genes at each locus (Supplementary Table S12), phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by RAxML as described in Supplementary method. According to the constructed phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. S4), bitter gourd was related to watermelon, rather than Cucumis spp., but it was evolutionary distant from other species. Previous studies suggested bitter gourd was more closely related to watermelon than to cucumber or melon, according to the internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes27 or sequences of chloroplast genes.28 Our results of synteny mapping and phylogenetic analysis seemed to support these results, but further information of genome sequences in more Cucurbitaceae species is necessary to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships precisely.3.4. Unique gene finding in the bitter gourd genomeThe synteny mapping analysis by using SyMap allowed to identify unique genes and gene orders in bitter gourd scaffolds. By comparing anchor gene lists (Supplementary Table S10), 3,158 annotated genes in the bitter gourd scaffolds did not correspond to any genes in other cucurbits genomes. Reversely, 2,468 genes were conserved in the genome of three cucurbit species but absent in the bitter gourd scaffolds. Comparing the functional annotation of these characteristic genes (uniquely present or absent) in bitter gourd genome, two gene classes were distinguished. Predicted genes encoding putative trypsin inhibitor-like proteins were more frequently observed in the bitter gourd genome than other cucurbits genomes (Supplementary Table S13), and 29 genes encoding trypsin inhibitor-like proteins were clustered in the non-syntenic scaffold regions to the other three Cucurbitaceae genomes (Supplementary Table S14). No known conserved domain was found in encoded proteins of 10 genes (Supplementary Table S14), but showed a sequence similarity to cucumber trypsin inhibitor-like proteins by the BLAST search. Of these genes, three genes in scaffold_32 (MOMC32_28g, MOMC32_34g, and MOMC32_37g) encoded identical or homologous proteins to Mch-1 or Mch-2,29 which were isolated from bitter gourd seeds. Although the conserved domain as the trypsin inhibitor was not observed in these proteins, it was shown that they had trypsin inhibition activity.29 In another study, mcIRBP, corresponding to MOMC1_984, was isolated from bitter gourd seeds as an insulin receptor-binding protein, and its injection reduced blood glucose levels in mice,30 implying its possible application to anti-diabetic medication. Phylogenetic analysis of putative trypsin inhibitors in bitter gourd showed that proteins with the I7 protease inhibitor and I13 protease inhibitor domains were separated, and several proteins without conserved domains (Supplementary Table S14) were categorized in the I7 protease inhibitor group. MOMC32_27, MOMC32_28, MOMC32_34 (Mch-2), and MOMC32_37 (Mch-1) formed a monophyletic group, close to I7 protease inhibitors (Fig. 1).

Additional notably unique genes in bitter gourd genome were ribosomal inactivating protein (RIP) genes. RIP is known as a plant toxin, which has N-glycosidase activity against adenine nucleotide in ribosomal RNA.31 Most RIPs were classified into two groups (type 1 and type 2).31 Type 1 RIP is a monomeric protein encoding the N-glycosidase activity domain (A-chain), and type 2 RIP consists of A-chain and B-chain (lectin-like domain). Multiple copies of RIP genes were observed in the Cucurbitaceae genome, but more paralogous genes, including both genes encoding A-chain (18 genes) and B-chain (8 genes), were present in the bitter gourd scaffolds than other cucurbit genomes (Supplementary Table S13). These bitter gourd RIP genes were clustered in six scaffolds, which were non-syntenic regions to other cucurbits genomes (Supplementary Table S15). Biological functions of RIPs in plants were not always well elucidated, but were possibly involved in the defense system against pathogenic fungi or bacteria via rRNA cleavage.32,33 On the other side, bitter gourd RIPs were well studied as a possible medically effective ingredient.34. Alpha-momorcharin and MAP30 were type-1 RIPs isolated from bitter gourd, and shown to have anti-viral and -tumor activity in mammalian cells.35,36 When these RIPs were used to treat HIV-infected cells, inhibition of viral replication was observed36 and additionally, MAP30 also inhibited integrase acitivty of HIV and topologically inactivated viral DNA37. Against tumor cells, it was demonstrated that both alpha-momorcharin and MAP30-induced apoptosis.35 Particularly, MAP30 caused little damage to normal cells,38 whereas cytotoxicity to normal liver cells was observed in alpha-momorcharin.39 Therefore, the clinical application of MAP30 was expected in cancers or protection for viral infection. Similarly, trichosanthin (TCS) from Trichosanthes kirilowii40 and balsamin from Momordica balsamina41 are known to have anti-viral activity. Alignment of amino acid sequences of balsamin showed that it was identical to MAP30 (data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis of TCS and the A-chain of RIPs in bitter gourd indicated TCS was closely related to alpha-momorcharin (Fig. 1). Although the biological functions of these trypsin inhibitors and RIPs are still unknown in bitter gourd plants, multiplication of genes for these proteins is unique to the bitter gourd genome, which might characterize bitter gourd as a medicinal plant.3.5. Mapping of RAD-seq tagsWe previously performed RAD-seq analysis to identify DNA polymorphisms between the two bitter gourd lines (OHB95-1A and OHB61-5).12 In this study, the RAD-seq tag sequences, represented by 80-base sequences from the AseI-digested ends of genomic DNA, were mapped to the OHB3-1 scaffolds as reference sequences for finding polymorphic loci at unique positions in the genome. As shown in Supplementary Table S16, ~90% of applied tags were mapped to unique positions of the OHB3-1 genome, whereas the other tags matched multiple loci on the genome. These uniquely mapped tags were distributed in 80% of the assembled scaffolds (Supplementary Table S16). Firstly, the RAD-tag mapping analysis determined the mismatches or indels between OHB61-5 or OHB95-1A and reference sequences (OHB3-1). As shown in Supplementary Table S16, ~3% of the uniquely reference-mapped tags in each inbred line contained mismatches and/or indels, representing an average frequency of these polymorphic loci as once per 2.7 kb in the bitter gourd genome. In addition, based on the tag-mapping results, putative heterozygous loci in each parent line were identified as described in the method, and 1,279 and 884 loci were predicted to be heterozygous in OHB95-1A and OHB61-5, respectively (Supplementary Table S16). The frequency of these putative heterozygous loci was < 1% of the uniquely tag-mapped loci, implying low heterozygosity in these inbred lines.3.6. Linkage map construction using RAD-seq markersFrom the RAD-seq results of two inbred lines and tag mapping to scaffold sequences of OHB3-1 as a reference, bi-allelic tags at polymorphic loci between OHB61-5 and OHB95-1A could be identified as described in Supplementary method. Totally, 1,507 pairs (loci) of bi-allelic tags polymorphic between the two parental lines were identified and employed as co-dominant markers in linkage mapping analyses (Supplementary Table S17). An F2 population derived from OHB61-5 × OHB95-1A was previously developed12 and employed to generate a linkage map. Genomic DNA from 97 F2 individuals was used in RAD-seq analysis using AseI, resulting in an average of 8,005,294 tags per an F2 plant. Genotypes of 1,507 bi-allelic tag markers in each F2 plant were determined based on the presence or absence of the allelic tag sequence. According to the genotype data of 1,507 markers in 97 plants, linkage positions of analyzed markers were determined using JoinMap4.1 software. At a cut-off LOD score = 7.0, 1,423 markers were separated into 11 linkage groups (Supplementary Table S18), which corresponded to the number of chromosomes in bitter gourd. The order of these markers in each linkage group was determined by calculating the genetic distances among markers, and a linkage map, encompassing 3,426 cM, was constructed (Supplementary Fig. S5). In accordance with the positions of the analyzed markers (bi-allelic tags) in the reference genome sequence, 255 scaffolds could be anchored to the constructed linkage map (Supplementary Table S18). Although analyzed RAD-seq tags were located in 80% of the assembled scaffolds, only 255 scaffolds (25%) were assigned on the linkage map, indicating that the frequency of bi-allelic tags were limited. Positions of RAD tag markers in each scaffold almost corresponded to their order in the linkage map, although inconsistency was occasionally observed in 473 loci. Nevertheless, the present result was far from developing pseudomolecules in the bitter gourd genome, since many scaffolds remained to be assigned on this linkage map. Considering the limited genetic diversity in bitter gourd lines, it might be difficult to increase marker density; thus, improving scaffold length by using a different assembly procedure and/or long read sequencing method such as PacBio, is necessary for completing its genome sequence analysis.3.7. Orthologous genes for sex determinationCucurbit crops are suitable models for elucidating sex determination in monoecious plant species.42 Since genes for sex determination have been identified in melon and cucumber, their orthologous genes were further explored in other Cucurbitaceae crops by BLAST searching, including bitter gourd. CmAcs11, encoding ACC synthase, responsible for female flower determination in melon.43 An additional ACC synthase gene, CmAcs-7,44 was also shown to regulate unisexual flower development in melon and putative orthologous genes were identified in related species. Amino acid sequences of these ACC synthases in cucurbits (Supplementary Table S12) were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was created including genes in Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup (Supplementary Fig. S6A). CmAcs-7 and its homologous proteins in cucurbits were phylogenetically distant from CmAcs11 and its homologs, suggesting the differentiation of these two ACC synthases. According to this analysis, the MOMC3_649 in bitter gourd (Supplementary Fig. S6A) was presumed to be an ortholog of CmAcs11. Two proteins similar to CmAcs-7 (MOMC46_189, MOMC518_1) were found in bitter gourd (Supplementary Fig. S6A), and grouped in the same clade in the phylogenetic tree.As the gene for male determination, CmWip1, encoding the zinc-finger domain protein, was identified in melon.45 Its putative orthologous genes were also searched in the genome of other Cucurbitaceae species and their phylogenetic relationship was also analyzed based on amino acid sequences of their encoded proteins as described above (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In this analysis, MOMC52-27 in bitter gourd (Supplementary Fig. S6B) was assumed to be an ortholog of CmWip1. These results showed that orthologous genes for known sex determination genes in melon or cucumber were also present in bitter gourd.RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7) demonstrated that MOMC518_1g(encoding CmAcs-7-like protein) and MOMC3_649g (encoding CmAcs11-like protein) were expressed in female flowers of bitter gourd plants more preferentially than male flower buds. This was in agreement with previous observations in melon or cucumbers, where both ACS11 and ACS-7 or ACS2 were highly expressed in female flower buds.43 Another gene encoding CmAcs-7-like protein in bitter gourd, MOMC46_89g, did not show specific expression in flower buds. Expression of the genes for MOMC52_27g (encoding CmWip1-like protein) was confirmed in flower buds, but significant differential expression among analyzed tissues was not observed, which was inconsistent with its male flower-specific expression in melon or cucumber.45 As shown by Switzenberg et al.46 in melon, specific expression of ACS gene in petal and stamen induced alternation of sex phenotype by ethylene production. Therefore, to elucidate functions in the sex determination of candidate genes in bitter gourd, their spatiotemporal expression patterns should be analyzed in flower buds.In Momordica, dioecious species, such as M. dioica or M. cochinchinensis, are also known. According to molecular phylogenetics, an African ancestor of Momordica species was predicted to be dioecious, and several conversions between dioecy and monoecy have occurred during its speciation and distribution from Africa to Asia.47 In M. dioica, it was suggested that ethylene was responsible for sex determination,48 although sex determination genes were undetermined. Therefore, molecular genetic studies of sex determination in Momordica species, including bitter gourd, will reveal the evolution of dioecy and monoecy. Boualem et al., succeeded in establishing dioecious mating system in melon by combining alleles of CmAcs11 and CmWip1.43,47 However, it was difficult to consider that these two independent genes had concerned to frequent conversion between monoecy and dioecy in Momordica species.5.

IntroductionMammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats (MIRs) represent an ancient family of tRNA-derived Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) found in all mammalian genomes, whose amplification seems to have ceased in the ancestors of placental mammals.1–3 This is in contrast with Alu elements, the most abundant SINEs, which are still transpositionally active.4 It is thought that MIRs may have arisen following the fusion of a tRNA molecule with the 3'-end of an existing Long INterspersed Element (LINE).5 The complete MIR element is about 260 bp in length and comprises a tRNA-related 5' head, a 70-bp conserved central domain containing a 15-bp core sequence, and a LINE-related sequence located at the 3'-end5 (Fig. 1). In an earlier study first describing MIRs, two segments overlapping with the LINE-related region were described as separate interspersed repeats MER24 and DBR.2Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideRepresentation of the structure of a mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR).

Pol III is expected to terminate at the first encountered termination signal (Tn) which may be located at varying distances from the end of the MIR body.MIR elements were actively propagating prior to the radiation of mammals and before placental mammals separated. For this reason their age was originally estimated to be ~130 million years (myr) even if it has been suggested that the CORE-SINE6 may have originated ~550 myr ago due to the remarkable similarity between Ther-1 (the MIR consensus in placental mammals which corresponds to that revealed earlier in humans) and the OR2 SINE of octopuses.7 Intriguingly, there are observations suggesting that the core region may serve some general function in mammalian genomes, because the level of sequence conservation is higher than the 3' and 5'-flanking sequences.8In the human genome, there are more than 500,000 annotated MIRs.9 Based on their sequence similarity, they have been grouped into 4 subfamilies named MIR, MIRb, MIRc, and MIR3. Like all SINEs, MIRs are thought to be transcribed by the RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) machinery, with the assembly factor TFIIIC recognizing the A- and B-box internal control regions within the tRNA-derived portion of the element.2 As well established for tRNA gene promoters, once bound TFIIIC recruits TFIIIB [composed of Brf1, Bdp1 and the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)], which in turn recruits Pol III.10 The first experimental verifications of MIRs as Pol III targets in the human genome have come from the results of genome-wide location analyses of the Pol III machinery in human11,12 and mouse cells.13,14 Interestingly, one of these studies revealed that, in human immortalized fibroblasts, the Pol III machinery is consistently associated with a MIR located in the first intron of the POLR3E gene, coding for a specific subunit of Pol III (RPC5). A significant enrichment of components of the Pol III machinery was also observed at a dozen other MIRs, thus supporting the notion that MIRs, although transpositionally inactive, can undergo autonomous transcription.11,13,14Unlike Alus that, although non-autonomous in retrotransposition, nevertheless exploit the LINE-encoded machinery to amplify in the genome, MIRs have ceased to amplify by retrotransposition ~130 Myr ago. This could be due to many reasons, including for example the inactivation of L2 (the partner LINE for MIR elements) or mutations in LINE-related regions of MIRs. Nevertheless, it can be speculated that since part of these elements are still transcriptionally active at least in the human and mouse genome,11 changes in the 3' tail due to sequence mutations could potentially rescue the retrotransposition potential of some of them. Recent studies have shown that enhancers are a platform from which MIRs can exert a regulatory function in the human genome9 and that MIRs can also serve as insulators acting as chromatin barriers or enhancer-blocking elements.15 Nothing is known, however, about the possible involvement of MIR expression in their role at enhancers/insulators. In general, in spite of some advancement in our knowledge of how the massive presence of MIRs impacts genome biology, their contribution to the human transcriptome is still largely unexplored, as are their transcription mechanism and regulation. In particular, the cis-acting elements controlling MIR transcription have never been systematically studied.In this study, by applying a recently developed bioinformatics pipeline to ENCODE RNA-seq data, we define for the first time the MIR expression profiles of human cells, and we investigate on the in cis requirements for MIR transcription by biochemical analysis in vitro.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bioinformatic pipeline for MIR expressionFor MIR RNA identification we used the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) long RNA-seq data within ENCODE16 of seven human cell lines (GM12878, H1-hESC, HeLa-S3, HepG2, HUVEC, K562, and NHEK). The RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37/hg19 as previously described.17 PolyA+ and PolyA- datasets (bam files) were merged to streamline the analyses. We were not interested in the differences between these two features because MIR RNAs usually do not have a poly(A) tail.The bam files from each dataset, containing RNA-Seq reads aligned to the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using TopHat aligner, along with the annotated MIRs, were submitted to a Python script that performs the identification of individual MIR transcripts. The script first builds stranded coverage vectors for the whole genome, using the bam file supplied and only considering uniquely mapped reads (tag NH:i:1 in the bam file). Then, for each annotated MIR having an expression coverage value over a calculated background noise threshold, the script calculates the coordinates of the corresponding expected full-length consensus element (see Supplementary Methods), to take into account the fact that many of the annotated MIR elements are truncated. Finally a flanking region filter is applied to the identified expected full-length element, as described in Supplementary Methods, in order to exclude false positives arising from MIR elements embedded in Pol II transcripts. The filter is designed to do this by imposing a significantly lower expression coverage value to the flanking regions immediately upstream and downstream of the expected full-length SINE, thus discriminating between genuine SINE RNAs and those that are ‘passengers’ of longer Pol II transcripts or part of their trailers extending downstream of their annotated 3'UTRs. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the pipeline, which is improved with respect to the one previously employed to distinguish genuine from ‘passenger’ Alu RNAs17 allowing us to control each step and to identify both Alu and MIR transcripts of the SINE class of retrotransposons.

Shown is a flow diagram of the improved bioinformatic pipeline for the identification of autonomously expressed SINE loci from RNA-seq data sets. See text and Supplementary Methods for details.Only MIRs which passed the final filter of the pipeline in both ENCODE RNA-Seq replicates were considered to represent autonomously expressed MIR loci and will be referred to as ‘expression-positive’. The complete list of expression-positive MIRs are reported in Supplementary Table S1.To further support the identification of unique MIR transcripts found in Hela-S3 and K562 cells we intersected the ChIP-seq peak data from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/) and Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) from ENCODE data uniformly processed by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wg EncodeRegTfbsClustered/wgEncodeReg TfbsClustered WithCells V3.bed.gz) for some Pol III transcription factors (TFs) binding sites with the coordinates of the expected full-length expression-positive MIRs, extended to 200 bp upstream. To identify other Pol II TFs associated with expression-positive MIR elements, we intersected, for each cell line, the 500 bp upstream of the expected full-length MIRs with the coordinates of the TF binding sites from ENCODE data, also uniformly processed by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group. The lists of Pol III-associated expression-positive MIRs and of those associated with other TFs are reported in Supplementary Table S2.2.2. Plasmid constructionFour human MIR loci (whose chromosome coordinates are reported in Table 3), together with their 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table S4. Constructs containing a targeted mutation of the B box internal control element were generated as described previously.17 Upstream deletion constructs employed forward PCR primers generating amplicons truncated at position -25 with respect to MIR A box at the 5'-end. Truncated amplicons were inserted into pGEM®-T Easy and the constructs selected for in vitro transcription contained the 5'-truncated insert in the same orientation as their wild-type MIR counterpart, to minimize the influence of vector sequence on transcription efficiency. 2.3. In vitro transcriptionAll recombinant plasmids for in vitro transcription reactions were purified with the Qiagen Plasmid Mini kit (Qiagen). Reaction mixtures (final volume: 25 µl) contained 500 ng of template DNA, 70 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 5 mM phosphocreatine, 2 µg/ml alpha-amanitin, 0.4 U/µl SUPERase-In (Ambion) as RNase inhibitor, 40 µg of HeLa cell nuclear extract,18 0.5 mM each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.025 mM UTP and 5µCi of [a-32P]UTP (Perkin-Elmer). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30 °C before being stopped by the addition of 75 µl of nuclease-free water and 100 µl of phenol:chloroform (1:1) pH 5.5. Purified labeled RNA products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and visualized, and quantified with a Cyclone Phosphor Imager (PerkinElmer) and the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).2.3. AvailabilityThe Python script allowing to identify individual MIR transcripts is available at the following URL: https://github.com/davidecarnevali/SINEsFind.3. Results3.1. A bioinformatic pipeline for the identification of transcriptionally active MIR loci from RNA-Seq datasetsTo leverage the potential of our previous work,17 we developed a pipeline in order to improve the identification of Pol III SINE transcripts (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Methods). We focused on the identification of MIR transcripts by applying the improved pipeline to the aligned Long RNA-Seq reads from ENCODE,17 considering for analysis a subset of the annotated MIR elements from the GRCh37/hg19 UCSC RepeatMasker track classified according to their genomic location: (i) MIRs mapping in intergenic regions (i.e. outside RefSeq, Ensembl, and lincRNA genes), (ii) MIRs mapping within RefSeq, Ensembl, and lincRNA genes but in antisense orientation, and (iii) MIRs fully contained within introns of RefSeq, Ensembl, and lincRNA genes in sense orientation and not overlapping with any exon. We refer to the first two groups together as ‘intergenic/antisense’.Figure 2 provides a schematic representation of our improved pipeline. The main improvements with respect to the previously described pipeline17 consist in the estimation of the ‘background’ coverage signal for each sample (instead using a fixed value for all the samples) and the definition of the flanking regions based on the global alignment of each annotated element with its consensus sequence (See Materials and Methods and Supplementary Methods).3.2. General features of MIR transcriptomes emerging from ENCODE RNA-seq data analysisA preliminary survey of the expression coverage of the MIR loci identified as expression-positive showed us both convincing MIR transcription profiles and less clearcut ones with noise background signals upstream and downstream of the MIR element probably deriving from the sequencing of introns or unknown Pol II transcripts. Even the latter cases, however, displayed expression coverage enrichment in the region of the annotated MIR element, suggesting the possibility of autonomous Pol III transcription as a pathway for their biogenesis, perhaps occurring in parallel with Pol II transcription of the host gene with intron-containing MIR RNAs generated by processing from longer Pol II transcripts. Since the tendency to high noise-to-background signals is more frequently observed in MIR element mapping within introns of Pol II genes in sense orientation, which constitute 79% of the expression-positive MIRs (see Supplementary Table S1), we decided to mainly focus on the expression of intergenic/antisense MIRs, while a few examples of gene-hosted sense-oriented MIRs will be addressed later in the Results section.The full list of MIRs identified as expression-positive by our search strategy is reported in Supplementary Table S1. As summarized in Table 1 each of the cell lines expressed a limited number of MIR elements (ranging from 145 in the case of GM12878 cells to 435 in the case of HUVEC cells). Of the whole set of 1301 expression-positive MIR loci a small percentage (~21%) were intergenic/antisense, which is in contrast with the global distribution of all the annotated MIRs regardless of their expression where the percentage of the intergenic/antisense MIRs is much higher (~68%) (see Supplementary Table S1). A significant fraction (~39%) of intergenic/antisense MIRs mapped in antisense orientation to annotated Pol II-transcribed genes. For comparison, the fraction of intergenic/antisense expression-positive Alus mapping in antisense orientation to the overlapping genes in the same cell lines was only 22%,17 suggesting that MIRs antisense to Pol II genes could have a more specific role, possibly correlated with the regulation of the overlapping gene. A small fraction (~20%) of all the expression-positive MIRs were found to be expressed in more than one cell line (see Supplementary Table S1), while this percentage decreased to 12% considering only the intergenic/antisense MIRs (Table 1). This suggests a marked cell line specificity in MIR expression (even though few MIRs seem to be ubiquitously expressed as will be further reported below) greater than the one found for Alu expression where the fraction of expression-positive Alus expressed in more than one cell line was higher (~24%).17Statistic of expression-positive MIR elements in selected cell linesaFor each cell line, the column reports the number of MIRs considered as autonomously expressed in both ENCODE RNA-seq replicates.bFor each cell line, the column reports the number of intergenic/antisense MIRs that are also expressed in one or more different cell lines.cReported in this column are the numbers of intergenic MIRs mapping with an antisense orientation to either protein-coding, non protein-coding or lincRNA genes.dThe numbers in this raw refer to individual MIRs expressed in one or more cell lines.Statistic of expression-positive MIR elements in selected cell linesaFor each cell line, the column reports the number of MIRs considered as autonomously expressed in both ENCODE RNA-seq replicates.bFor each cell line, the column reports the number of intergenic/antisense MIRs that are also expressed in one or more different cell lines.cReported in this column are the numbers of intergenic MIRs mapping with an antisense orientation to either protein-coding, non protein-coding or lincRNA genes.dThe numbers in this raw refer to individual MIRs expressed in one or more cell lines.As summarized in Table 2, no significant under- or over-representation of any particular MIR subfamily within the set of expressed MIRs was observed (see Supplementary Table S1).

Survey of expressed MIRs according to location and base-resolution expression profileThe ~6 × 105 annotated MIRs are not all complete in sequence, and represent only a portion of the canonical full-length MIR element. Among expression-positive MIRs, we found both complete and incomplete elements and, correspondingly, three main types of base-resolution expression profiles: (i) full-length or almost full-length MIRs (Fig. 3A and B), covered by sequence reads along all their extension; (ii) incomplete MIRs representing either the left or the right portion of the canonical full-length MIR but whose transcript coverage tends to correspond to the one of a fully transcribed canonical MIR [more specifically, transcript coverage tends to extend into the downstream MIR-unrelated region for incomplete MIRs lacking the 3' moiety (Fig. 3C), while it tends to start in an upstream MIR-unrelated region, possessing functional A and B-boxes, for incomplete MIRs lacking the 5' moiety (Fig. 3E)]; (iii) incomplete MIRs lacking the 3' moiety (thus containing A and B boxes) and producing transcripts that do not extend outside of the MIR sequence (Fig. 3D).

It also displayed a specific, yet very low coverage, below the threshold for a positive score, in H1-hESC, HeLa-S3, HepG2, and NHEK cells. This representative MIR is full-length and maps to intron 6 or 7 (depending on which transcript isoform is considered) of the NPAS3 gene, in antisense orientation. It has an expression profile that almost entirely covers the annotated element with uniquely mapped sequence reads. The double-humped expression coverage profiles shown in Figure 3 are due to cDNA size selection during library preparation and sequencing specifications, as previously reported.17 A- and B- boxes are conserved at 13 and 50 bp downstream of the TSS, respectively. Unusually, the annotated MIR contains a strong termination signal (T4) in its sequence 104 nt from the beginning of the element, which is clearly skipped by the Pol III machinery, given the coverage signal in the downstream moiety of the element. We investigated the possibility that the genomes of the cell lines analyzed had a sequence variation with respect to the reference GRCh37/hg19 sequence, in correspondence of these Pol III strong terminators. To this end, we reconstructed the corresponding consensus genome sequences from RNA sequence reads (see Supplementary Methods). We did not find any sequence variant, thus indicating the presence of a termination signal skipped by the Pol III machinery. Another terminator of 4Ts is present in the downstream moiety of the MIR, leading to a transcript of ~220 nt. Strong support for the genuine nature of this Pol III-derived MIR RNA comes from the association with this locus of the Pol III subunit RPC155 in K562 cells (Fig. 3A).Figure 3B shows a MIR fully contained within an intron of the PAMR1 gene in the sense orientation that has been found to be expressed in 5 cell lines. The Pol III-dependent character of this transcription unit is supported by its association with the Pol III subunit RPC155 and the Pol III transcription factor BDP1 in K562 and HeLa cell lines, also confirming the ability of Pol III machinery complex to access and transcribe Pol II genomic loci.Reported in Figure 3C is the transcript coverage profile of an incomplete MIR element of 159 bp (chr16:22309780-22309939 MIR_dup2285), which was expressed in all 7 cell lines. This element aligns to the left portion of the MIR consensus sequence, but its transcription continues downstream of the region annotated as MIR (in orange in Fig. 3C) for ~200 nt before encountering a non-canonical termination signal (T3CT). This previously characterized MIR11 is located in antisense orientation in the first intron of the POLR3E gene, encoding a subunit (RPC5) of human RNA polymerase III. Its transcription by Pol III is supported by the presence of canonical A- and B-boxes as well as by association with components of the Pol III machinery in HeLa-S3 and K562 cell lines. Here, again, the annotated MIR portion contains a strong termination signal (T4) early in its sequence, 121 nt downstream the 5' end of the element. Another potential terminator is located 82 nt downstream of the 3' end of the annotated element. In this case, the coverage signal tends to decrease temporarily but slightly increases again downstream, until a non-canonical terminator is encountered. The skipping of the first terminator by Pol III is supported by the expression coverage levels upstream and downstream, which are almost the same, strongly suggesting that they arise from the same transcript. In contrast, lower coverage downstream of the second terminator suggests the occurrence of only limited read through of this termination signal by Pol III. We also considered the possibility of a mutation in the strong terminator sequences in the DNA of these cells (see above), but we did not find any sequence variant, thus confirming the ability of Pol III to skip strong terminator signals within certain sequence contexts.19 This result was partially confirmed by in vitro transcription analysis (see Fig. 5).In Figure 3D, we report a MIR element (chr17:17863550-17863651 MIRb_dup1281), found to be expressed at low levels in in H1-hESC cell line, originating from an incomplete MIR element antisense to the TOM1L2 gene. By inspecting the coverage profile in other cell lines, we could find signals of much lower expression in at least one replicate of each of the analyzed cell lines. The source element of this transcript corresponds to a MIRb left fragment carrying in its sequence functional A- and B- boxes. The transcript coverage precisely spans the length of the annotated element up to a strong terminator (T10) right at the end of it, leading to a transcript of ~100 nt.Figure 3E shows a MIR, found as expression-positive in H1-hESC, K562 and NHEK cell lines, whose transcription initiates in an upstream MIR-unrelated region (chr14:89445565-89445634 MIRc_dup2189) and ends ~50 nt downstream of the annotated element corresponding with a strong termination signal (T5). By inspecting the MIR-unrelated upstream region we found canonical A- and B- boxes, indicating that this MIR element, lacking Pol III promoters in its sequence, is transcribed from an upstream MIR-unrelated region providing functional control elements. Also in this case we noted a termination signal (T3AT4) at the beginning of the annotated element which seems to be (partially) skipped in vivo by Pol III (as for MIR_dup2285 in POLR3E gene in Fig. 3C) and is located right at the end of the first coverage hump. Indeed the second hump has a slightly lower coverage signal (at least in H1-hESC and NHEK cells) suggesting a shorter primary transcript as confirmed by in vitro transcription (see below). The binding of Pol III TFs throughout this region in K562 cells, together with the transcript coverage profile, strongly support the Pol III-dependence of this MIR transcript.As a further note on the MIR in Figure 3C, a Polr3e antisense-oriented MIR with the same location and similar sequence of MIR_dup2285 is also present in the mouse genome, where it has also been shown to be transcriptionally active, and to be associated with an unusual second point accumulation of RNA Pol II, in addition to the expected one in the Polr3e promoter, which abuts precisely on the Pol III occupancy peak reflecting MIR transcription on the opposite strand.14 These observations, along with the fact that this MIR is conserved in human and mouse, led the authors to hypothesize a functional role of this MIR in POLR3E gene regulation. We therefore asked if this second RNA Pol II accumulation point also occurs in the ENCODE cell lines, and found Pol II peaks for all 7 cell types (see Supplementary Table S5) thus strengthening the hypothesis that this transcriptionally active MIR plays a regulatory role in Pol II transcription of POLR3E. Figure 4 shows Pol II in three of the seven cell lines along with the Pol III signals. Figure 4Open in new tabDownload slideSimultaneous Pol III and Pol II accumulation signals at MIR_dup2285.

Fig. 3C).Finally, we asked if there was a correlation between the expression of the 78 MIRs overlapping with Pol II protein-coding genes in antisense orientation and the expression of the overlapping genes themselves. To this end, we compared normalized read counts of the MIRs in each replicate with those of the overlapping Pol II genes using the Pearson correlation coefficient (See Supplementary Methods) and found only positive correlation (r > 0.7 with P  < 10 - 5) for few genes (ARHGEF3, DSCAM, GNA15, JAKMIP2, LRP2, NBPF10, PLXDC2, TMEM177) (data not shown). We also asked whether the protein-coding genes characterized by the presence of intronic MIRs (mapping in either antisense or sense orientation) are enriched in any particular gene ontology functional category. Interestingly, we found a strong enrichment (P < 10 - 139) for genes producing multiple proteins due to alternative splicing, suggesting a possible influence of intronic MIRs on this process. When expression-positive MIR only were considered, such a GO enrichment was less marked, although still remarkable (P value 1.8 × 10 - 24).3.4. Association of the Pol III machinery with expression-positive MIRsBefore the use of RNA-Seq data to help identify expression-positive SINEs, genome-wide studies based on ChIP-Seq approaches were used in humans and mouse models with the aim of producing inventories of loci inferred to be transcribed by Pol III from their association with one or more component of the Pol III machinery.11,12,14,20,21 Such studies revealed a limited number of Pol III-associated SINE elements, and most of them were Alus. The availability of genome-wide ChIP-Seq data from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (SYDH) and from ENCODE data uniformly processed by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group for key components of Pol III transcription machinery (BDP1, BRF1/2, RPC155, and TFIIIC110) allowed us to readdress this issue, by investigating whether a significant enrichment of these TFs could be found in the expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs of HeLa and K562 cells. Supplementary Table S2 lists the expression positive MIRs found to be associated with Pol III components in HeLa and K562 cells. In HeLa cells, of the 32 intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs, only 5 were found associated with one or more Pol III TFs. The three transcription components whose association was found to be statistically significant, with a P  < 5.5x10 - 5 (calculated using Fisher’s exact test), were BDP1, TFIIIC-110 and RPC155 when considering the fraction of the intergenic/antisense expressed MIRs against the total intergenic/antisense annotated ones. When the Pol III component association with the 156 intron-hosted sense oriented expression positive MIRs was investigated, only one (MIR_dup2691 reported in Fig. 3B) was found associated with the Pol III subunit RPC155. When K562 cells were considered, a higher percentage (36%, 15 MIRs) of intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs where found bound by one or more Pol III components, while the percentage drop down to 3% (4 MIRs) when considering the 119 MIRs fully contained within introns of Pol II genes in sense orientation (data not shown). In K562 cells we found significant enrichment for BDP1, TFIIIC110 and RPC155 (P values 5.2 × 10 - 9, 9.7 × 10 - 6 and <2.2 × 10 - 16, respectively) in intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs. It is interesting to compare these results with those previously reported for Alus.17 K562 cells were found to have a higher number of Alu loci bound to components of the Pol III machinery complex than HeLa cells, thus suggesting a more permissive environment for Pol III association in K562 cells. The lower percentage of Pol III-associated elements among intronic sense-oriented expression-positive MIRs suggests that their expression is Pol II-dependent in most cases.Interestingly the MIR antisense to POLR3E, expressed in all 7 cell lines, is the one bound by the highest number of Pol III TFs in both HeLa and K562 cells (BDP1, BRF1, TFIIIC-110, RPC155) thus further confirming its genuine character of Pol III transcription unit.3.5. Association of expression-positive MIRs with TFsIn order to assess whether the upstream region of MIR elements could influence their transcription through TFs specifically interacting with it, we took advantage of the availability of ChIP-Seq data for several TFs within ENCODE datasets. We asked if intergenic/antisense MIRs identified as expressed through our pipeline tend to be associated with one or more Pol II TFs, in addition to the known components of the Pol III machinery. The results of this analysis are reported in detail in Supplementary Table S2. Highly variable TFs associations were observed among the 7 cell lines, both in terms of the total number of TF-bound MIRs (ranging from 7 to 21) and in terms of the number of TFs associated to each MIR, mostly depending on the number of available TF ChIP-seq data for each cell line (ranging from 3 in NHEK cells to 100 in K562 cells). Among the Pol II-related transcription proteins most significantly associated with expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs we found RNA polymerase II itself (POLR2A), TBP, MAX, MAZ, and YY1 (Supplementary Table S3). HeLa, HUVEC and NHEK cell lines are those with the lowest number of TFs being measured by ChIP-seq and therefore have very low numbers of intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs bound by TFs and with no significant enrichment.3.6. Expression-positive MIRs and chromatin statesA recent study, showing that MIR elements are highly enriched in the enhancer state of chromatin in K562 and HeLa cell lines9 prompted us to investigate whether our intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs found in the same cell lines were among those found by this study. We intersected the coordinates of our expression-positive MIRs with those of the MIR elements found to be enriched in enhancers (lifted over from NCBI36/hg18 to GRCh37/hg19), but we found only one overlapping MIR among the fully intronic sense-oriented dataset. We also tested for enrichment in the enhancer states of expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs by using the ENCODE Chromatin State Segmentation data. A Fisher’s exact test was performed against all the other annotated intergenic/antisense MIRs used in the pipeline. We found significant enrichment only in Gm12878 and HUVEC cell line in strong enhancer state (P values 6.35e - 06 and 1.08e - 05, respectively) (Supplementary Table S5). Extending the test to the fully intronic sense-oriented expression-positive MIRs, we did not find any significant enrichment in any of the seven cell lines.Considering the results from another study15 which shows that MIR sequences provide insulators in the genome of CD4+ T cells, we verified if any of our expression-positive MIRs found in all the seven cell lines analysed were among the MIR-derived insulators, but we found only three overlaps. Again, we decided to check if our expression-positive MIRs were enriched in the insulator state of chromatin but we found very few not statistically significant (using Fisher’s exact test) overlaps between the coordinates of our expression-positive MIRs, both intergenic/antisense (no overlaps) and fully intronic sense-oriented (one in GM12878, two in H1-hESC, three in HepG2, and two in NHEK cell lines), and those of genomic regions marked as insulators in ENCODE Chromatin State Segmentation by HMM data (data not shown).3.7. In vitro transcription analysis of expressed MIR elementsOur bioinformatic pipeline permitted us to detect in vivo expression of individual MIR elements that could be transcribed by the Pol III machinery. To confirm Pol III transcription and make a precise promoter characterization of these transcriptional units, we conducted their in vitro transcription in a HeLa nuclear extract. We focused our attention on a small subset of MIR loci, which are expressed in at least three cell types (listed in Table 3). One of them is MIR_dup2285 (chr16:22309780-22309939), expressed in all the seven investigated ENCODE cell lines and associated with at least 3 components of the Pol III machinery in both HeLa-S3 and K562 cells (see Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S2). Another locus subjected to in vitro transcription analysis, MIR_dup3493 (chr1: 34943459-34943727), was found to be expressed in four cells lines (GM12878, H1-hESC, K562 and NHEK) and has A- and B- boxes perfectly matching the consensus.22 The remaining two in vitro tested loci (MIRb_dup5848 chr2:71762977-71763215 and MIRc_dup2189 chr14:89445565-89445634) were found to be expressed in at least three cell types (GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG2, NHEK and H1-hESC, K562, NHEK respectively). Based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data, only MIRc_dup2189 is associated with two components of the Pol III machinery (RPC155 and BDP1). MIRs subjected to in vitro transcription analysisaThe column lists, for each MIR element, the cell lines in which it was found to be expressed by ENCODE RNA-seq data analysis.bThe reported transcript lengths were calculated by assuming as TSS the A or G residue closest to the position 12 bp upstream of the A box. To estimate the 3’ end of the transcript, both canonical (Tn with n = 4) and non-canonical T-rich Pol III terminators [17] were considered both within and downstream of MIR body sequence (indicated in parentheses after the transcript length). For canonical terminators, the four Us corresponding to the first four Ts of the termination signal were considered as part of the transcripts; for non-canonical terminators, all the nucleotides of the terminator were considered as incorporated into the RNA. In the case of MIR_dup2285, for which two possible A boxes could drive transcription, the expected lengths of both putative alternative transcripts are indicated (Supplementary Fig. S1).MIRs subjected to in vitro transcription analysisaThe column lists, for each MIR element, the cell lines in which it was found to be expressed by ENCODE RNA-seq data analysis.bThe reported transcript lengths were calculated by assuming as TSS the A or G residue closest to the position 12 bp upstream of the A box.

In the case of MIR_dup2285, for which two possible A boxes could drive transcription, the expected lengths of both putative alternative transcripts are indicated (Supplementary Fig. S1).The above MIRs were transcribed in vitro using a HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of a-amanitin (2 µg/ml) to completely inhibit RNA polymerase II activity (Fig. 5). Transcription reactions were also programmed in parallel with two mutant versions of each MIR element: one in which the B-box internal promoter element was inactivated by site-specific mutagenesis, and the other in which the upstream flanking region was deleted. Control transcription reactions were set with empty pGEM-T-Easy plasmid (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 10) and the same vector carrying either a previously characterized Alu (AluSq2 chr1:61523296–61523586)17 (lanes 2 and 11) or a tRNAVal (AAC) gene (TRNAV18, chr6) (lanes 3 and 12) whose transcription produces three different primary transcripts (of 87, 112 and 142 nt) because of heterogeneous termination at one of three consecutive termination signals.19 Each of the tested MIR elements produced a distinct pattern of transcription, in which the sizes of the most abundant transcripts agreed with those predicted on the basis of sequence inspection of the Pol III termination signals, either canonical (a run of at least four Ts) or non-canonical, both internal and in the 3'-flanking region (see Table 3). In particular, the MIR_dup2285 transcription unit has a predicted non-canonical terminator (T3CT) ~200 bp downstream the 3' end of the annotated element, as well as two strong early terminators, along with another non-canonical terminator, that seems to be skipped by the Pol III machinery (Supplementary Fig. S1). The first strong terminator (T4) is located within the annotated element 121 nt from the start coordinate, while the other one (T4), located 240 nt downstream of the 5' end, is downstream of the annotated element but still within the corresponding expected full-length MIR. As shown in Figure 5 (lane 4) all four transcripts, corresponding to the four termination signals, are identified during in vitro transcription, supporting the hypothesis of terminator skipping by Pol III. However it is worth noting that the most abundant signal arises from the transcript ending at the first strong Pol III terminator, suggesting a reduced tendency of the Pol III machinery complex to skip terminators of this MIR in vitro than in vivo (see profile in Fig. 3C). A fifth transcript, migrating between 112 nt and 142 nt markers, is also identified as likely corresponding to a transcript ending at the first strong terminator but using an alternative A-box (see Table 3). Figure 5Open in new tabDownload slideIn vitro transcription for selected expression-positive MIRs. In vitro transcription reactions were performed in HeLa nuclear extract using 0.5 µg of the indicated MIR templates (lanes 4–9, 13–18).

When the MIR B-box was mutationally inactivated (by substituting CG for the invariant TC dinucleotide of the B box consensus sequence GWTCRAnnC), a clear reduction in MIR transcription efficiency was observed in each case, thus confirming the importance of this element for MIR transcription. Remarkably, however, in no case was transcription abolished by B box inactivation. This was most evident for MIR_dup2285, whose B box-independent transcription was only 2.4-fold less than full transcription (cf. lanes 4 and 16). These data demonstrate that MIRs are efficiently transcribed by Pol III and confirms a key role for B box recognition by TFIIIC, even though the appreciable levels of residual transcription observed with B box-mutated MIRs provide evidence of a key role of A box (and possibly of 5'-flanking region) as a core promoter element in the assembly of the basal transcription machinery, even in the absence of a B box, as previously observed for other Pol III-transcribed genes in yeast.23To understand if upstream regions influence MIR transcription as they do in the case of Alus,17 we compared the in vitro transcriptional activity of the four isolated MIRs with that of the corresponding 5'-deletion mutants. As shown in Figure 5, upstream sequence deletion negatively affected transcription to different extents for the different MIRs. Transcription of upstream deleted MIRs was reduced by 1.8- to 2.5-fold in the case of MIR_dup2285, MIR_dup3493 and MIRb_dup5848 (cf. lanes 4, 7, and 13 with lanes 6, 9 and 15, respectively), while it was only moderately reduced (~1.3-fold) in the case of MIRc_dup2189 (cf. lanes 16 with 18). Overall these data reveal that MIR transcription is generally influenced by the upstream region, albeit at a lower extent than Alu transcription.DiscussionThis work provides, for the first time, a comprehensive account of transcriptionally active MIR loci in human cells and identifies MIR-derived transcripts representing novel ncRNAs in which a MIR fragment is fused with a MIR-unrelated, unique sequence. It also confirms the existence of ubiquitously transcribed MIR elements that could play a role in the regulation of their Pol II-transcribed overlapping genes.The analysis of publicly available ENCODE RNA-seq datasets using an improved bioinformatic pipeline derived from our previous work17 allowed us to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single locus resolution using a search strategy that worked well especially for intergenic/antisense MIRs, whose coverage expression profiles where less biased than in the case of intronic sense MIRs by signals arising from sequencing of unknown ncRNA or hnRNA introns.While a few previous studies on MIR elements focused on their genomic role as regulatory sequences, none of them tried to asses MIR expression in vivo, presumably because the only known role of MIR transcripts was that of retrotransposition and they ceased to amplify ~130 myr ago.2 The only previous experimental evidence of MIR transcription by Pol III in mammals consists of the results of genome-wide localization analyses of the Pol III machinery in human cells11,12 and in mouse.13,14 Our results reveal that MIR elements, although retrotranspositionally inactive, are widely transcribed and thus contribute to the ncRNA transcriptome of human cells.Pol III transcription of MIRs occurs extensively both in intergenic regions and within introns of Pol II genes both in antisense and sense orientation. Pol III thus generates a MIR transcriptome composed mainly of cell-specific transcripts and, to a lesser extent, of a tiny subset of MIR-derived RNAs expressed in more than one cell line. Many of the observed MIR-derived transcripts arise from complete MIR elements that are transcribed along their entire length. However, we also found frequent cases of expressed MIRs corresponding to the left or right portion of the canonical full-length MIR whose transcription gives rise to chimeric RNAs composed of a MIR portion fused with a MIR-unrelated unique sequence from the genomic moiety downstream or upstream of the annotated MIR fragment. The genuine, Pol III-dependent character of expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs identified by our analysis is supported by their statistically significant enrichment of associated Pol III components within ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets for HeLa-S3 and K562 cells.As previously observed for Alus, we confirm the ability of the Pol III machinery to access SINE elements located in genomic regions transcribed by Pol II, both in the sense and antisense orientation, suggesting the possibility that Pol III-dependent MIR transcription might contribute to the regulation of the overlapping Pol II-transcribed genes. On the other hand, the high percentage of expression-positive MIRs within introns of both protein-coding and noncoding Pol II genes in antisense orientation (see Table 1) might explain their significant association with components of the Pol II machinery (see supplementary Tables S2–S3) and strengthens the notion of a close, functionally relevant association of Pol II and its TFs with Pol III genes.24Particularly intriguing in this respect is the MIR element located within the first intron of POLR3E gene. This MIR was found to be expression-positive in all the seven cell lines we analyzed, and its intronic location within this gene appears to be conserved in mouse and other mammals (data not shown). Furthermore, its Pol III transcription is conserved at least in mouse.14 This MIR produces a chimeric transcript containing a MIR-unrelated downstream moiety, and its Pol III transcription is confirmed by the high number of associated Pol III components (see Fig. 3C). Since the POLR3E gene codes for a subunit of Pol III (RPC5), it is tempting to speculate that a MIR-mediated negative autoregulation occurs at this locus, whereby Pol III transcribes the MIR element whose transcription in turn downregulates Pol III abundance through reduced Pol II-dependent expression of its RPC5 subunit.14In an effort to elucidate basic features of MIR transcription mechanism and control, we studied the in vitro transcription properties of four expression-positive MIR loci, and we could establish three distinctive features of Pol III-dependent MIR transcription: (i) the importance of B-box promoter recognition by TFIIIC, but also the possibility of some levels of B box-independent MIR transcription; (ii) the influence of 5'-flanking sequence on MIR transcription; (iii) the strong epigenetic control of MIR expression in vivo, allowing for cell type-specific expression of MIRs containing equally strong basal promoters. Of the four MIRs, whose transcription properties were analyzed in vitro in this study, all showed a marked reduction of transcription ranging from 2.4 to 5.2-fold following mutation of the B-box promoter. Moreover three of them exhibited a 1.8 to 2.5-fold reduction of transcription, while only one was almost unaffected, upon deletion of the 5'-flanking region. The impact of the 5'-flanking region on MIR transcription efficiency is less marked than in the case of Alus17 thus suggesting the possibility that the MIR internal promoter is intrinsically stronger.The appreciable levels of residual transcription upon B box disruption, together with the modest reduction of transcription upon deletion of the 5'-flanking sequence, suggests that the assembly of the Pol III transcription machinery on MIRs might take place through alternative pathways, involving either the 5' flank-A box pair or the A box-B box pair of cis-acting elements. We also cannot exclude that other factors, such as Pol II, TBP, and YY1, which were found to be enriched at expression-positive MIR loci, could take part in Pol III transcription of MIR elements in vivo.The idea of an epigenetic control used by the cell to domesticate transposable elements has been widely accepted and used to explain their overall low expression levels despite their genomic abundance (reviewed in25,26). Recently, SINE silencing has been proposed to more strictly depend on histone methylation rather than DNA methylation.27 This in vivo epigenetic silencing can be deduced from the same in vitro transcription levels of all the four cloned MIRs, whose expression profiles completely differ from each other in cell lines. Epigenetic control could also be responsible for the higher rate of strong terminator signals skipping by Pol III whose ability is only partially maintained in vitro.Until now, MIRs have been studied from a genomic perspective while no efforts have been carried out to obtain insight into their actual in vivo expression and the role of Pol III machinery in their transcription. The present work reveals that these ancient transposable elements that have lost their retrotranspositional activity million years ago, are still widely transcribed in human cells. Their genome-wide expression profiling at single locus resolution represents another step toward the understanding of the mechanisms through which the cells have domesticated them, as well as of the possible roles played by both the act and the products of MIR transcription. The differential expression in different cell types of a large fraction of expression-positive MIR elements is suggestive of a strong epigenetic control which is specific to each cell type and condition, thus opening the possibility to exploit MIR expression profiling to monitor and discover patterns of epigenomic alterations that may accompany pathological states. The ever-increasing availability of RNA-seq datasets for many cell types in different physiological and pathological states represents a valuable source of information for our bioinformatic pipeline to assess, as anticipated for Alu RNAs,28 MIR RNA profiles and their possible roles as a novel type of highly specific molecular signature of diseases.This work used computational and storage services associated with the Hoffman2 Shared Cluster provided by UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education’s Research Technology Group.

IntroductionHibiscus syriacus (L.) (rose of Sharon) is a fast-growing deciduous shrub of the Malvaceae family, which includes species such as Gossypium raimondii and Theobroma cacao. Although its’ name indicates this species was first identified in Syria, H. syriacus likely originated from the Korean peninsula and southern China and has since spread to Western countries. In temperate zones, H. syriacus is a commonly grown ornamental species with attractive white, pink, red, lavender, or purple flowers displayed over a long blooming period, though individual flowers last only a day. Its Korean name, Mugunghwa, literally means ‘flowering forever’. In addition to its ornamental value, H. syriacus acts as an ozone bioindicator,1 and its dried flowers and root bark are used in Oriental herbal medicines. Specifically, a novel cyclic peptide (Hibispeptin A) and three naphthalene compounds (syriacusins A-C) isolated from the plant’s root bark have been used as anti-pyretic, anti-helminthic and anti-fungal agents.2,3Polyploidy is a well-established influence on plant genome evolution but is now recognized as a common phenomenon in diverse eukaryotes,4,5 as signs of whole-genome duplication (WGD) have been detected in many sequenced genomes. Recent genome analysis demonstrated that most eudicot plants descended from an ancient hexaploid ancestor and followed lineage-specific polyploidization6 and that two rounds of WGD occurred in ancestral vertebrates.7 In general, changes in ploidy are expected to be deleterious and an ‘evolutionary dead end’ for many species.8 However, polyploidization of plants mediated their survival during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event by increasing their genetic diversity.9 Each round of polyploidization was followed by many gene deletions (homeolog gene loss), interchromosomal rearrangements, neofunctionalization, and subfunctionalization.4,5 In Malvaceae plants, Gossypium includes five tetraploid taxa (AD1 to AD5, 2n= 4x) and 45 diploid taxa (2n= 2x).10 Among them, G. raimondii10 (DD, D-genome), G. arboreum11 (AA, A-genome) and G. hirsutum12 (AtDt) genomes were reported. Hibiscus also includes many polyploid species, such as H. syriacus (2n= 4x= 80), H. aspera (2n= 8x= 72), and H. rosa-sinensis (2n= 16x= 144) and diploid species [H. pedunculatus (2n= 2x= 30) and H. phoeniceus (2n= 2x= 22)].13Here, we report the genome sequence of H. syriacus and the possible correlation between polyploidization and its phenotypes. Comparative genomic analysis of Malvaceae species, including H. syriacus, T. cacao, and G. raimondii (DD), provides clues of the recent polyploidization in H. syriacus by WGDs and unequal regulation of gene dosage by subsequent paleopolyploidy. Our investigation of copy number variations of floral regulators in Malvaceae plants also offers insight into the evolution of flowering phenotypes in H. syriacus. Moreover, the reference genome of H. syriacus is an important resource for identifying relationships between polyploidization and gene diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first report on whole genome sequence analysis of polyploidy woody plants and the effects of WGD on their unique phenotypes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and whole genome sequencingLeaves of H. syriacus plants >100-years-old and nominated as National Monument of Korea trees (serial number 520) were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA for Paired-end (PE) and Mate-pair (MP) libraries was extracted, and libraries for next-generation sequencing were constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of each library was validated using the KAPA SYBR FAST Universal 2× qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA, USA). Each library was sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.2.2. Genome assembly, scaffolding and gap-closingGenome assembly was performed using both Platanus v1.2.114 and SSPACE v2.0.15 To generate longer initial contigs, single reads merged using FLASH v1.2.216 and reads from the PE libraries were assembled using Platanus with parameters to resolve heterozygosity in the H. syriacus genome (-u 0.2 -c 5 -d 0.3 -m 460). The scaffolding process was performed with Platanus and SSPACE. We first determined mapping seed length for scaffolding and then generated longer scaffolds using optimized Platanus parameters (-l 5 -s 41 -u 0.3). To extend scaffold length, SSPACE fulfilled serial scaffolding with hash parameters for the scaffolds generated by Platanus. Lastly, remaining gaps were filled with Platanus and GapCloser version 1.10 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/down/GapCloser_release_2011.tar.gz) using reads from the PE and MP libraries.2.3. Genome annotationAnnotation of the H. syriacus genome was performed using the KOBIC annotation pipeline (modified PGA pipeline17) consisting of repeat masking, mapping of different protein sequence sets, and ab initio prediction performed by AUGUSTUS v3.0.3.18 The protein sequences of A. thaliana (TAIR10, http://www.arabidopsis.org), T. cacao19 and G. raimondii10 were mapped using GeneWise v2.120 to generate protein-based gene models for consensus modeling. AUGUSTUS was used for gene prediction in H. syriacus. Then predicted gene models from AUGUSTUS were validated using BLASTp with protein sequences from the three genomes (T. cacao, G. raimondii and A. thaliana) as queries and erratic gene models were filtered with a BLASTp cut-off value of query coverage = 0.3. The predicted gene models from GeneWise were also filtered using query coverage = 0.3. Remaining gene models of GeneWise depicted as GeneWise format were reformatted as GFF3 data and used to determine the consensus gene model via EVidenceModeler (EVM),21 which combines ab initio gene predictions with protein alignments into weighted consensus gene structures (ab initio predictions = 1, protein alignment = 5, transcript alignment assemblies = 7). Biological functions of the final gene models were assigned using InterPro,22 plant protein sequences in the RefSeq23 and UniProt databases,24 which includes SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL data as described in previous study.17 For functional annotation, three quality criteria were concerned: (i) bit score of the BLAST result is >50 and e-value is <e-10; (ii) subject coverage of the BLAST result is >60%; and (iii) top token score from lexical analysis is >0.5. To infer function for the protein-coding genes, we used InterProScan25 version 5.4 to scan protein sequences against the protein signatures from InterPro.2.4. RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assemblyTotal RNA was extracted from plant leaves, petals, ovaries, and roots using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-Seq libraries were generated using purified total RNA and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Thirty-six gigabases of raw reads were generated and preprocessed using DynamicTrim and LengthSort in SolexaQA.26 The preprocessed raw reads were then used for transcriptome assembly and DEG analysis. Velvet v1.2.07 was used to assess k-mer sizes and assembled contigs, which were then merged using Oases v0.2.08. Assembled transcripts were validated using BLASTx (e-value < e-10, best hit) against 1,917,424 protein sequences from 39 plant genomes selected from each family including Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum phureja, T.cacao, G.raimondii, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Cucumis sativus, Vitis vinifera.2.5. Evaluation of genome assemblyFor validation of the assembled genome sequence, CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Apporoach) v2.527 and BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) v1.2228 were used in H. syriacus genome using default parameters. The CEGMA mapped a gene structures to new genomic sequence using a set of highly conserved protein family in eukaryotes by Hidden Markov Model. We evaluated 248 core eukaryotic genes defied by CEGMA to our genome sequence. The BUSCO provides completeness assessment of assembled genome based on orthologous group with single copy from OrthoDB (http://www.orthodb.org) using hidden Markov model for profile of amino acid alignments. For BUSCO assessments, we used 429 gene sets of conserved orthologs in eukaryotes.2.6. Detection of gene families in the H. syriacus genomeOrthoMCL v2.0.229 was used to identify gene family clusters in H. syriacus and the other four sequenced genomes which are G. raimondii, T. cacao, A. trichopodaand A. thaliana (In the first step, a set of high quality of gene models was obtained by rejecting low-quality sequences based on default parameters in OrthoMCL. The default parameters of rejecting low quality protein sequences were (i) shorter than 10 amino acids (ii) >20% stop-codons (iii) >20% non-standard amino acids. Pairwise sequence similarities between all input protein sequences were calculated by all-by-all BLASTp with an e-value cut-off of 1e-05 and a minimum match length of 50%. To define ortholog cluster structure, a Markov clustering algorithm was applied with an inflation value (-I) of 1.5 (default value in OrthoMCL). Putative splice variants were removed from the data set; longest protein sequences were kept and subsequently filtered for premature stop codons and incompatible sequences.2.7. Detection of collinearity blocks in Malvaceae plantsMCScanX30 was used to construct synteny and collinearity blocks between H. syriacus and G. raimondii against T. cacao.19 First, homologous gene pairs were identified using protein sequences from the three genomes and then scanned inter- and intra-species by BLASTp (options with -e 1e-10 –b 5 –v 5). The BLASTp output was used with merged GFFs of three species to perform MCscanX with default parameters. We generated gene synteny and collinearity data to align proteins of the two species against reference chromosome of T. cacao. Collinearity blocks containing fewer than five proteins were excluded. To search a candidate of duplicated regions, we made the groups of collinear block from multiple collinear blocks which have similar protein members (>80%), and the same chromosome in T. cacao. Then, each block in H. syriacus and G. raimondii was counted by overlap against the cluster blocks of T. cacao. The duplicated regions in H. syriacus and G. raimondii were identified, if the number of blocks was more than two.2.8. Estimation of speciation time in Malvaceae plantsTo construct a phylogenetic tree of the five species (A. trichopoda, A. thaliana, G. raimondii, T. cacao and H. syriacus), we extracted 941 single-copy gene sets from all genomes in the OrthoMCL clusters. We performed multiple alignments of the CDSs of each gene set using Prank (-f = nexus -codon).31 The alignment file was used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on calculations of divergence time for the five species.32 For accurate tree construction, we assigned taxon sets based on previously calculated speciation of A. thaliana, G. raimondii and T. cacao. The Bayesian software package BEAST32 (v1.8.2) was used to estimate divergence times and construct the final tree. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses in BEAST was conducted for 10 million generations with samples every 1,000 steps and the effective sampling size was over 150 for all of parameters. We used SRD0633 as a substitution model and the Yule process34 as a traditional speciation model.2.9. Identification of TF candidatesWe identified TF candidates as previously described.17 Briefly, predicted proteins containing TF domains were screened by InterProScan22 search against Pfam35 databases. The TF candidates were classified based on rules as indicated at PlnTFDB (http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/rules.php, Rules for the classification of TFs).36 In the case of TF gene families that don’t have Pfam ID, domain alignments as Clustal format were downloaded from PlnTFDB and Hidden Markov Model profiles were built and screened using HMMER.37 The assigned TF candidates were confirmed by BLASTp against plant TF protein sequences downloaded from PlnTFDB (http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/downloads.php).2.10. Identification of genes encoding nucleotide-binding site proteinsTo identify nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-encoding genes, representative genes from each plant genome were screened using the raw Hidden Markov Model (HMMER3.0)38 to search for the Pfam NBS family PF00931 domain (e-value cut-off of 1.0). All putative NBS protein sequences were analysed and manually curated by a BLASTp search against known R gene sequences in GenBank. To further identify TIR homologs and sequences encoding CC and LRR motifs, candidate NBS-LRR protein sequences were characterized using SMART,39 the Pfam database40 and the COILS programme41 with a threshold of 0.9 to detect CC domain specifically.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyH. syriacus plants over 100-years-old were selected for genome sequencing. Illumina whole-genome shotgun sequencing generated 233.3 Gb (122.8× coverage) of genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S1). PE libraries (250–500 bp) were generated, and 2 kb and 5 kb MP libraries were sequenced with a read length of 101 or 151 bp. Pre-processing analysis of raw sequences was performed to remove extraneous sequences for accurate genome assembly as described in the previous report.17 After filtering, 156.6 Gb (82.4× coverage) of H. syriacus genome sequences were used for further analysis (Supplementary Table S2). K-mer distribution analysis, which provides information related to low frequencies, sequencing depth, level of heterozygosity, and genome size42 was then applied using Jellyfish (Supplementary Fig. S1). The estimated genome size of 1,901 Mb was calculated by dividing the total volume by the peak of distribution as described previously.17Validation of the assembled genome was performed using 128,888 representative transcripts derived from de novo assembly of a combined transcriptome from all libraries (Supplementary Table S3). To confirm sequence alignment between transcriptome assembly and scaffolds, we performed BLAST comparisons for the transcriptome assembly and scaffolds as queries and subjects, respectively. We found that 117,431 (91.1%) assembled transcripts as query sequences matched to scaffolds based with 98% identity. In addition, 93,688 (79.8%) transcripts matched to genome sequence with query coverage over 80%, and 82,394 (70.2%) transcripts matched over 90% coverage by the assembled scaffolds (Supplementary Fig. 2). The quality of the assembly was also evaluating using CEGMA27 (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) and BUSCO28 (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs). These analyses showed 92.74% of completeness (230 of 248 CEGs) from CEGMA and 92% of complete BUSCOs. These results suggested that H. syriacus genome assembly was high quality. As a result, 1,748 Mb (91.9% of 1,901 Mb) of genomic sequences were assembled into 77,492 scaffolds. The assembled genome was comprised of 33 Mb (1.9%) gap sequences and 1,715 Mb of contigs with N50 = 30 kb (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Summary of H. syriacus genome assemblySummary of H. syriacus genome assembly3.2. Genome annotationAnnotation of the H. syriacus genome was performed using the KOBIC Genome Annotation pipeline (Supplementary Fig. S3), including masking repetitive sequences, transcriptome mapping, reference protein mapping using GeneWise, ab initio gene prediction, and determination of consensus gene models using EVM.Before masking repetitive sequences, repeat annotation was performed by RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) for the assembled genome. Due to a lack of repeat sequence information for this genome, we constructed a de novo repeat library using RepeatModeler, and RepeatMasker was applied for annotation of the constructed repeat library. Repeat sequences, except for unknown transposable elements (TEs), were masked so we could identify essential gene families, such as those that encode receptor-like kinases and nucleotide-binding proteins. TEs comprised 1,095.8 Mb (57.6%) of the genome (Supplementary Table S5) and mostly included long terminal repeats (LTRs), which accounted for approximately 30% of total TEs. Gypsy and Copia retrotransposons were the most common LTRs detected.Transcripts mapping was performed using TopHat and Cufflinks, and protein alignment was performed by GeneWise. The protein sequences of A.thaliana (TAIR10), T. cacao and G. raimondii were mapped to generate protein-based gene models. For annotation of duplicated genes or gene families, mapping regions of a reference protein in the H. syriacus genome were determined from tBLASTn (default e-value 10) results using custom Perl scripts. These steps prevented mis-annotation of duplicated genes due to lack of mapping data for reference proteins from parsing single best-matched regions in the H. syriacus genome. We annotated 87,603 genes using KOBIC annotation prediction with an average CDS length of 1,188 bp, similar to that for G. raimondii (Table 2). Consensus gene models were evaluated using 88.4 Gb of Illumina-derived RNA-Seq data. Overall, 91.76% of the predicted coding sequences were supported by Illumina data, demonstrating the high accuracy of KOBIC annotation prediction. The H. syriacus genome contains two times more genes than G. raimondii and three times more genes than T. cacao (Table 2), suggesting a polyploid genome as first indicated in a previous report.13Statistics of H. syriacus gene modelsaCacao genome paper19bCotton genome paper10cTAIR10 annotation (http://www.arabidopsis.org)Statistics of H. syriacus gene modelsaCacao genome paper19bCotton genome paper10cTAIR10 annotation (http://www.arabidopsis.org)We also performed OrthoMCL analysis to detect orthologous genes among Malvaceae plants, A. thaliana, and Amborella trichopoda. We identified 21,472 orthologous gene sets containing 164,660 genes, 5,300 of which were H. syriacus-specific (Fig. 1). Interestingly, these genes were the number of gene was three times larger than those of G. raimondii and T. cacao, further indicating H. syriacus’ polyploidy. In addition, relatively large numbers of singletons in the genomes of A. thaliana and A. trichopoda suggest that the Malvaceae lineage diverged long ago and now shows a high degree of evolutionary distance from other eudicots. For further analysis, estimation of speciation time and comparison of genome structures among Malvaceae plants were performed using paired gene sets.

Genome structure and polyploidization of H. syriacusTo compare genome structures among Malvaceae plants, collinearity blocks were detected using MCScanX.30 Two WGDs or a triplication event have occurred in G. raimondii (DD),43,44 while none have occurred in T. cacao. Therefore, the T. cacao genome was used as a template to detect collinearity blocks in G. raimondii and H. syriacus (Fig. 2A). We detected T. cacao collinearity blocks in G. raimondii and H. syriacus with frequencies ranging from 2 to 7. The H. syriacus genome contains four times as many collinearity blocks than G. raimondii and blocks two times larger, indicating WGD events in H. syriacus. Duplication patterns were identified using phylogenetic analyses, which revealed single-copy flowering regulator genes in the diploid genomes of A. thaliana, A. trichopoda and T. cacao (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Duplication of the GIGANTEA (GI) gene indicated WGDs occurred three times in H. syriacus but that many descendant genes since the first WGD have been lost (Fig. 2B), such as the CONSTANS and SOC1 genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, diploidization and homeolog loss in H. syriacus, first proposed in previous studies,5 included duplication of distinct, individual gene families stemming from random homeolog gene loss after each WGD. Paleohexaploidy has occurred in the G. raimondii genome,10,43,44 and duplication patterns we observed were consistent with these previous results.

Red (H. syriacus) and green (G. raimondii) stars indicate WGD and blue circles indicate diploidization events.To estimate divergence time among Malvaceae plants, we calculated synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and constructed phylogenetic trees via the BEAST package using single-copy genes in OrthoMCL clusters. The trees revealed that the Malvaceae family diverged from a Brassicae-Malvaceae common ancestor approximately 91.91 MYA (Fig. 2C) and that H. syriacus, G. raimondii and T. cacao belong to a common subclade that diverged from a common ancestor approximately 30.88 MYA, which corroborates earlier studies.10 Occurrence of duplications in G. raimondii genes ranged from 24.46 to 45.46 MYA (Fig. 2B), while H. syriacus individual gene duplications before speciation and WGD events ranged from 25.23 to 48.23 MYA and from 4.61 to 21.15 MYA, respectively (Fig. 2B and C). These results suggest that one WGD occurred in H. syriacus before speciation and two WGDs occurred after speciation.Previous reports indicate transcriptional factors (TFs) were retained as duplicated genes, while other genes remained singletons.5 We investigated the duplication status of TFs in H. syriacus, and other Malvaceae plants and identified 9,642 TFs and transcriptional regulators in 81 families in the H. syriacus genome. Eighteen H. syriacus TF gene families, including AP2-ERF, AUX/IAA, and FAR1, contained more genes than those in diploid genomes (Supplementary Table S6). In particular, the H. syriacus genome contains 10 times more FAR1 family genes than the other genomes we analysed, although 19 TF genes showed convergent evolution patterns, and the proportions of other major TF family genes were similar across species. Thus, complex WGD events followed by diploidization led to unequal regulation of gene dosage and caused gene family copy number variations in H. syriacus.3.4. Flowering-time and disease-resistance genes in H. syriacusGenetic and molecular mechanisms of floral development in different plant species is highly conserved45 and include four major flowering pathways (photoperiod, autonomous, vernalization and gibberellin) well-characterized in A. thaliana. Main flowering signals are regulated by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the photoperiod pathway, while the vernalization pathway acts via removal of an FT repressor after exposure to certain stimuli. H. syriacus is a long-day flowering plant with a long blooming period and can express a multivoltinism phenotype with 20–30 blossoms per day. However, the flowers of H. syriacus open daily and last for only one day. To uncover the genetic mechanisms controlling these phenotypes, we investigated genes involved in the four major flowering pathways of A. trichopoda, A. thaliana, T. cacao, G. raimondii and H. syriacus and their expression pattern in H. syriacus tissues (flowers, ovaries, roots and leaves) (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic analysis of flowering-time genes identified H. syriacus-specific clusters (Fig. 3B). Because flowering time is frequently dependent on gene copy number,46 we used reference genes from Arabidopsis species to determine copy number variation of these genes among diverse plant genomes (Table 3) and found that copy numbers of H. syriacus were two to seven times greater than those in the other four genomes analysed. Among the flowering-time regulatory genes examined in our study, numbers of genes involved in circadian rhythm regulation (CO, ELF4, FKF1, GI, LHY, PHYs) and flower initiation (FCA, FLK, FT, LFY, VIN3, SOC1, TFL, SVP) were significantly higher in H. syriacus than in the other genomes. Moreover, the copy number of FAR1 family genes that modulate phytochrome A signaling showed high copy numbers in H. syriacus compared to other genomes (Supplementary Table S6). Plants with spike inflorescence, such as barley, rice, and wheat, also contain high copy numbers of FAR1 genes; thus, high copy numbers of FAR1 may also affect the flowering phenotype of H. syriacus.

(B) Expression patterns of photoperiod/circadian clock genes in petals, ovaries, roots, and leaves.Comparison of flowering-time gene copy numbersComparison of flowering-time gene copy numbersMost disease-resistance (R) family genes encode intracellular proteins with a NBS and leucine-rich repeats (LRR).47–51 The NBS-encoding R gene family is one of the largest in the H. syriacus genome, with 472 genes, approximately three times greater than A. trichopoda and A. thaliana. These genes are divided into two clades based on presence of the distinct toll interleukin receptor (TIR) domain.50 TIR genes in H. syriacus (n= 76, 17%) are markedly over-represented compared to those of S.lycopersicum (25 genes, 9%), G. raimondii (27 genes, 9%) and T. cacao (17 genes, 6%) (Table 4 and Fig. 4). More than 70% of NBS-encoding genes in Malvaceae plants (H. syriacus, T. cacao, and G. raimondii) are shared among 26 subclasses, indicating that most R genes are derived from a common ancestor (Supplementary Table S7). In addition, 125 NBS-encoding genes in H. syriacus from four subclasses are expanded approximately five time more than other Malvaceae and 18 NBS-encoding genes from seven subclasses are unique to H. syriacus (Supplementary Table S8). Notably, genes in TIR and RPW8 motif-encoding subclasses (NBS cluster 11 and NBS cluster 20, respectively) exhibited extensive expansion in the H. syriacus genome, underwent unequal duplication events, and displayed great diversity among plant genomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S8). The different R gene repertoires in the H. syriacus genome suggest that expansion and diversity of clustered R genes might involve lineage-specific gene duplication events, eventually leading to divergent evolution in close relatives. These results provide useful preliminary information to support further comparative analysis of flowering-time and disease-resistance genes in other perennial plant species.

DiscussionPolyploidy is an important mechanism of plant speciation that occurs in many angiosperms5 and leads to increased genetic diversity compared to their diploid progenitors. Initial polyploidy events were followed by successive paleopolyploidy or diploidization events to stabilize the newly expanded genomes. Paleopolyploidy or diploidization returns a polyploidy genome to a diploid-like state and is characterized by loss of duplicated genes, chromosomes, and repetitive DNA, gene silencing, and altered chromosome pairings.4,5 The newly formed polyploids may experience rapid homeolog gene loss, genome reconstruction post-polyploidization, and altered patterns of gene expression.5 Retained diploid genes are less often duplicated due to cumulative losses of the homeologous copy in a duplicated gene pair. Consequently, some genes are consistently returned to singleton status, while others, such as those encoding TFs, are retained in duplicate.5,52 Duplicated TF genes were commonly found in the H. syriacus genome, although 25% of these genes showed evidence of convergent evolution, and their copy numbers varied greatly. Our phylogenetic analysis of individual genes in H. syriacus also indicated that homeolog gene loss events and diploidization occurred after WGD. Recent studies have suggested that one duplicate gene may be more susceptible to loss than others,4 which could account for unequal gene dosage and corresponding phenotypic changes in H. syriacus.The flowering phenotype of H. syriacus is characterized by multivoltinism, a long blooming period, and high blossom turnover. We found that the copy numbers of most flowering-related genes, such as GIGANTEA, CONSTANS, and ELF4 (but not FT), were higher in H. syriacus than in the diploid genomes of T. cacao, A. trichopoda, and A. thaliana. In addition, FAR1 genes, which modulate phytochrome A signaling by directly activating transcription of FHY1 and FHL and lead to accumulation of nuclear phytochrome A, were significantly increased in H. syriacus. FAR1 regulates the circadian clock, and its high copy number could directly affect the flowering phenotype of H. syriacus as seen in plants with spike inflorescence.The investigation of duplication event timing in H. syriacus genome showed that two recent WGDs occurred after speciation. In the past 50 million years, the average global temperature has been <20°C,53 which is far below the optimal flowering temperature for H. syriacus. Lower temperatures, especially between 5 and 20 MYA, could have been an environmental suppressor of H. syriacus pollination that prompted polyploidization to overcome these unfavourable conditions and unreduced gamete formation.5 Furthermore, low temperatures could have exerted selective pressure on H. syriacus to extend its blooming period for increased chance of pollination.Perennial plants are prone to invasion by pathogens before reproduction, and many fungal and bacterial diseases often threaten the life cycle of H. syriacus. Aside from primary defenses, such as thickened cell walls and secondary metabolites, plants have numerous disease resistance (R) genes that confer protection against various pathogens. In H. syriacus, NBS-containing R genes account for ~0.53% of its total predicted genes, which is lower than other plant genomes studies, whose R gene proportions ranged from 0.63 to 1.35%. However, subsets of these genes, including those with TIR- and RPW8-encoding motifs, are markedly over-represented in the H. syriacus genome compared to those of other plants. Genes in the RPW8-NBS-LRR subclass provide broad-spectrum resistance against powdery mildew pathogens in Arabidopsis,54 and genes in TIR-NBS subclasses are conserved in basal angiosperms and eudicots, such as A. trichopoda (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5), but are absent in most monocots.55,56 Their greater dominance in the H. syriacus genome indicates divergent evolution of TIR- and RPW-containing NBS genes from an ancestral origin may have led to more extensive expansion of this gene family. Moreover, the long life cycle of woody plants makes it difficult for them to adapt to pathogens undergoing more rapid evolution, thus favouring R gene maintenance and expansion for the plants’ survival.Polyploidization in plants is a common mechanism for their adaptation to environmental change. After divergence from the H. syriacus-G. raimondii common ancestor, two WGDs and subsequent diploidization occurred in the H. syriacus genome to promote the plants’ survival in unfavourable environments. During the diploidization events, low temperatures may have selected for the maintenance of duplicate flowering-related genes whose high copy numbers led to the multivoltinism and long blooming period phenotypes expressed by H. syriacus. Further analyses H. syriacus, T. cacao and G. raimondii (DD) genomes with another diploid genome, G. arboretum (AA)11 and allotetraploid genome, G. hirsutum (AtDt)12 will provide more information of evolution of Malvaceae plants.AvailabilityThis Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession MBGJ00000000.

IntroductionIdentifying sequence polymorphisms responsible for phenotypic variation and understanding the genetic basis of complex traits have been two major challenges of plant molecular genetics since the development of the first molecular markers up to the impressive high-throughput genomics technologies available today.1,2 The process of genotype-phenotype association is one of the central goals in the path towards plant improvement, and this requires the use of all the genetic and genomic information available for a given individual and/or population. The association of the genomic variation with traits of interest requires the reliable detection and the systematic investigation of the entire spectrum of DNA variability, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (INDELs) as well as copy number variations (CNVs) and presence/absence of variations (PAV). Substantial progress towards this goal was made in the last few years. Large germoplasm collections have been characterized using SSR,3,4 SNP markers and SNP arrays.5–9 However, most of these approaches had known disadvantages that limited the power of the detection, in particular because the SNPs used in these studies were selected from a limited number of divergent sources and were commonly chosen to exceed a minimum frequency of the rare allele. Whole genome sequencing has also been used to explore individual variation at the genomic level in plants10–13 but, due to its high cost and complexity in data analysis, it is not expected to be widely applied for investigation of variants underlying specific traits of interest at a sufficient coverage. Recently, the development of microarray based or liquid-based genomic selection methods, commonly referred to as ‘Sequence Capture’, provided an affordable way to produce high-quality variants, thus solving most of the ascertained bias reported.14–16 Combining the recently developed targeted sequence enrichment with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, Sequence Capture methodology represents a powerful strategy for enhancing data generation to assess genetic variation of target regions, and it is likely to replace PCR as the main target enrichment method in both plants and animals.17 In addition, setting the experiments to obtain a sufficient depth of coverage would support the detection of rare functional variants and allow the discovery of complete haplotypes of genes, as well as CNV and PAV. With the ever-decreasing costs of sequencing and the advances in Sequence Capture technologies, these approaches are nowadays largely applied in different fields. Thanks to its high reliability and moderate cost per experiment, Sequence Capture is becoming an affordable diagnostic tool for medical and personalized medicine purposes.18 Despite its large employment in the medical field, the use of Sequence Capture in plant science is still emerging. Sequence Capture experiments were carried out for few species, including maize,19 strawberry,20 rapeseed canola,21,22 black cottonwood,23 potato,24 wheat,25,26 medicago17 and cassava.27The work herein proposed, which investigates the sequence variation of a group of 378 genes and the related regulative regions in a collection of 44 landraces, represents the first study of Sequence Capture in tomato species. Although software tools are available for variant calling and variant mining, their application is not straightforward, requiring users to install various packages and to convert data into different formats. This lack of easily accessible software pushed us to propose a web-based tool, named SUPER-CAP (http://supercap.sequentiabiotech.com/), to boost quick, proficient and affordable analysis of sequence capture data. This tool, benefitting from SUPER-W pipeline28 and combining different software and customizable procedures, assists the user in sequence capture experiments from the identification of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) to the reconstruction of genotype-specific (hereafter referred to as ‘private’) sequences/gene features for each target region of each sample.In addition, in this study, an explorative investigation on different aspects affecting sequence capture data was also carried out. For instance, since one of the major challenges in the enrichment/capture technologies are to avoid spurious variants calling for heterozygous (He) loci, this work evaluated how the depth of the reads and the procedure set-ups impact the variant calling of He variants. In fact, being the tomato a highly homozygous (Ho) species, it represents a good model for testing He variant calling into the gene set considered. In addition, spurious callings are frequently referred to multi-copy gene families (duplicated region/high homologous regions).29 The gene set considered in this study represents a large range of variability in terms of gene families. This allowed for suitable assessment and estimation of the effective presence of He variants among the multi-copy genes.As a final point, the variant set was also used to investigate: (i) the level and the type of sequence polymorphism in captured genes across the 44 tomato samples, (ii) the pattern of variants distribution among the lines, with respect to the identification of rare variants, (iii) the number of genes CNV, PAV and (iv) the functional annotation of the variants in order to prioritize the study of highly relevant variants. The work herein proposed represents a framework for easy Sequence Capture-related experiments that will promote similar studies, as well as in differing species. 2. Material and methods2.1. Plant material and selection of target genesA panel of 44 genetically diverse Solanumlycopersicum genotypes was selected from a wide collection of tomato landraces30 available at the University of Naples, department of Agricultural Sciences. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under controlled conditions at the aforementioned Department; detailed information, including source and geographic origin for each genotype, is presented in Supplementary Table S1.Genomic DNA from the 44 genotypes was isolated from young tomato leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNA quantity and purity/degradation was firstly checked on 1% agarose gel. In order to fit the standard parameters for Sequence Capture analyses, DNA concentration and quality were determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s requirements.An inventory of 378 candidate genes representing possible targets for antioxidant metabolism in tomatoes was compiled from published literature, previous research31,32 and exploration of metabolic pathway databases (LycoCyc at http://solgenomics.net/and KEGG at http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Genes were also selected to represent different gene family sizes. In total 235 out of the 378 genes completely represent 25 gene families. In particular, 171 genes belong to eight large gene families (we declared a big family if composed by more than 10 copies in the genome), 40 belong to seven medium gene families (between nine and four gene copies), and 24 belong to 10 small gene families (two or three copies). Six out of the 378 genes represent single copy genes. Moreover, in order to take into account variations in the regulatory region of each selected gene, a 3 Kbp promoter region was also included in the analysis. For genes with an intergenic distance shorter than 3 Kbp, only the related shorter portion of the promoter was considered. Supplementary Table S2 shows detailed information of the genomic regions considered.2.2. Sequence capture design and sequencingProbe design and gene enrichment were performed following the protocol provided with the solution-based Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Library (Roche-NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA). Loci coordinates of the genic and promotor regions were identified and submitted to Roche Diagnostics for probe design using NimbleDesign and SignalMap software (http://www.nimblegen.com/products/software/index.html). This probe set contains probes with up to 20 close matches in the genome as determined by the Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/ssaha/). Acco rding to NimbleGen specification, we considered a probe to match the genome if the variation ratio was <0.05. Following the SeqCapEZ protocol, 44 paired-end libraries were prepared using the Illumina Kapa Library Prep Kit and were multiplexed and sequenced with HiSeq 1,500 (read size:100 bp) according to Illumina specifications.2.3. SUPER-CAP usage and proceduresSUPER-CAP is a bioinformatics tool specifically designed for accurate mapping, variant calling and reconstruction of private sequences using the variations detected from Sequence Capture data. SUPER-CAP includes an updated version of SUPER-W (release 4).28 SUPER-CAP is a user-friendly web tool which only needs two input files to work: the captured region file in BED format and the filtered NGS reads in FASTQ format. The main steps and procedure underlying the SUPER-CAP tool, including the calling variants, the variants filtering and the targeted sequence reconstruction are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideThe SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideThe SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.The SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.The SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.SUPER-W has been modified to specifically handle sequence capture data. In this new version, SUPER-W uses as input the BED file of capture probe design (it can also handle a whole exome) and the filtered NGS reads. The first step is to map all the samples against a reference genome (specified by the user) with BWA (version 0.7.5; options used: mem:BWA-MEM algorithm).33 The mapped files are processed for PCR duplicates (Picard, MarkDuplicates tool, version 1.118), filtered for quality (minimum quality required: 30), sorted and indexed.34 The resulting BAM file is then used for the variant calling step. Small variations (SNPs and short deletion and insertion polymorphisms), large variations (deletions, inversions and duplications), or both, can be set for detection. The small variations are called with SAMtools34 through an accurate and sensitive double calling step, while the structural variants are detected using LUMPY (version 0.0.11; options used: -mv 4 –tt 0 –pe –sr).35Once the variant calling step has been successfully completed, statistics on sequence capture experiment are calculated. The statistics report can be considered as a checkpoint, allowing the user to check the IN/OFF target read count, which highlights the specificity or sensitivity of the sequence capture experiment.Raw genomic variants annotated by SUPER-W are then classified and filtered out. As default, only variants with a coverage >6× and a Phred quality >30 were used for subsequent analysis. Furthermore, variants overlapping each other are removed from downstream analysis as they cause a low confidence region. Moreover, a special option has been released to allow calling variants according to customized allele frequency (AF). As default value, variants with an AF between 0 and 0.2 are considered Ho for the reference allele, variants with a AF between 0.4 and 0.6 are considered He while variants with an AF between 0.8 and 1 are considered Ho for the alternative allele. Variants with an AF ranging out of boundaries set (i.e. between 0.2 and 0.4 and between 0.6 and 0.8) are called with an alert comment in the output VCF file. Coverage and quality filters as well as the AF parameters can be manually modified by the user. Finally, the filtered variants were classified according to type (SNP or INDEL). For SNP variants the breakdown into transitions and transversions was also determined. To improve the variant features, SnpSift and SnpEff36 were implemented in the workflow, which allows imputing the gene region in which the variants fall (promoter, intron, exon, Untranslated regions (UTRs)) and the putative impact of the variants on protein functionality.The high-quality variants, the reference genome and the BED file of the captured regions were used to perform a targeted sequence reconstruction. Using bcftools37 and BEDtools38 utilities, a new consensus sequence was created by applying the filtered variants to the reference sequence. He SNPs were introduced using IUPAC ambiguity codes and He INDELs were discarded. Through a liftover process, which recalculates the gene coordinates after the insertion or deletion of INDELs, a FASTA file with reconstructed sequences was created. Variants reconstructed were also displayed in the SUPER-CAP’s browser results page, allowing the user to explore the type and the number of variants easily.2.4. Web tool development and designWith the aim of supplying SUPER-CAP with a graphical user interface, we developed a NodeJS-based web tool (version 4.4.1. Available at https://nodejs.org/), available at ‘http://supercap.sequentiabiotech.com/’. Using this tool, the user can upload the two required files (the BED file of the target regions and the FASTQ files of the sequenced reads) and choose the analysis parameters (i.e. the quality thresholds for the filtering procedure and the AF range for the He /Ho assignation). An ID is given after completion of the procedure, which is required for accessing the results page. Both the reconstructed sequences in FASTA format and the whole variants in VCF format can be downloaded from the ‘Download section’. In addition, the visualization of the reconstructed sequence is also shown in an interactive graphical interface in the results page. Here the user can explore, for each gene in each genotype, the type and the number of variants that have been incorporated and the effect they produced on the reference protein. General mapping statistics, including IN/OFF targets, as well as the sensitivity of the experiment, are displayed in the same page.2.5. Use of SUPER-CAP on tomato experimental dataThe reads obtained by sequencing the tomato DNA samples were quality checked using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Then, reads were filtered for quality and trimmed with the Trimmomatic tool (version 0.30; options used: –windowsSize 3 –requiredQuality 22 –MINLEN 30).39 By using the filtered reads, the following procedures were undertaken: reads falling in the designed regions with a PHRED quality >30 and a minimum length of 30 bp were mapped onto the tomato genome SL2.50.40 Then, PCR duplicates and multiple mapped reads were removed by filtering on a meaningful MAPQ score of 30. Once the variants were called, in order to reduce the number of false positives calls, an additional filter was applied and only variants with coverage higher than 6× and a PHRED quality >30 were selected. The total numbers of He and Ho variants, as well as their ratio, were calculated with default parameters (0.4–0.6 as optimal AF range for the He calling). A Neighbour-joining dendrogram was built in TASSEL v.541 by using the detected filtered variants, and the related tree was graphically refined using the Fig-tree software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). SNPs and INDELs were also structurally and functionally annotated with SnpEff v4.236 using the tomato iTAG2.40 annotation.2.6. Validation of variantsTo test the reliability of the adopted procedures, a validation of the variants detected was achieved by exploring publicly available data for tomato. In particular, data from a previous genotyping experiment which detected variants for 7,720 SNPs through the SolCAP array,30,32 as well as data concerning the resequencing of 360 tomato genomes,42 were considered. Of the 44 genotypes used in this study, 37 were common to those used in the SolCAP experiment and 9 in the 360 genome project. The validation was performed by comparing the number and the concordance of shared variations among the common genotypes. Only Ho variations were used for the validation. Intersection of the sets was carried out by intersectBed tool38 and the comparison analysis by using VCFtools.432.7. CNV and PAV identificationThe coverage and total number of reads were evaluated for each sample. Alignments were visualized using the IGV browser version 2.3.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). CNV was computed following a modified procedure of Schiessl et al. (2014)22 using a normalized read coverage for each captured region. CNV in a given target region was assumed if the ratio of normalized coverage (genotype)/normalized coverage (all genotypes) was <0.5 or >1.5, respectively. PAV was assumed if the ratio was <0.05.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequence capture experimentWe designed a custom capture probe experiment by using a customizable and cost-effective approach based on Roche-NimbleGen SeqCap EZ technology. This framework helped to set up an in silico approach (SUPER-CAP) with the aim of facilitating further sequence capture studies.This study investigated the sequence variation of a group of 378 genes and related regulative regions. The total size of the sequenced region was 2,338,578 bp, of which 1,353,817 bp corresponded to genic regions and 984,761 bp to their related promoter regions. Capturing probes were developed by Roche NimbleGen to target the specific regions. The final design was non-redundant and covered about 92.6% of the targeted regions. The 7.4% of non-covered regions represents those that did not match the minimum parameters for the capture and in the majority of the cases (>95%) these were promoter regions. It has already been reported that the cover design slightly varies depending on different factors, including the commercial technology adopted.44After the enrichment of the targeted regions, each capture library was sequenced in one Illumina HiSeq lane. The number of raw reads generated per sample varied between 1,103,352 and 2,683,868 (Table 1). Sequenced reads were analyzed in order to remove low-quality regions. After quality trimming, between 71 and 93% of the reads were retained and then used as input for SUPER-CAP. Data were then statistically evaluated for: (i) alignment rates, the number of mapped reads on the total reads, (ii) specificity, the number of reads that map to the targeted sequence and (iii) sensitivity, the percentage of targeted bases covered by sequence reads. The reads from samples 21A, 1A and 64A showed the highest alignment rates (>98%). In contrast, the lowest alignment rate was observed in genotypes 85A, 79A and 38A (<78%). The alignment success was however independent of the total number of reads. Specificity of the capture was imputed considering the number of reads in the target interval on the number of mapped reads. It showed an average value of 74.80%. The minimum value 67.2% was detected for the genotype 14A and the maximum (77.02%) for the genotype 43A. In addition, considering an extension of flanking regions of 200 bp, the specificity was found to vary only slightly, showing an average increase of <1%. The range, considering flanking regions, was indeed from 67.75 to 77.59%. Alignment statistics for the 44 individual captures (Sample ID)The number of raw reads (Raw reads), mapped reads (Mapped reads), mapped reads with quality Q > 30 (Mapped reads Q>30) and without duplications (Mapped reads Q > 30 WD) were reported. For each sample, the alignment rate (Alignment rate), the specificity (On target reads), the specificity including the flanking regions of 200 bp (On target reads + 200 bp) and the average depth of coverage (Mean depth of coverage ) are also reported.Alignment statistics for the 44 individual captures (Sample ID)The number of raw reads (Raw reads), mapped reads (Mapped reads), mapped reads with quality Q > 30 (Mapped reads Q>30) and without duplications (Mapped reads Q > 30 WD) were reported. For each sample, the alignment rate (Alignment rate), the specificity (On target reads), the specificity including the flanking regions of 200 bp (On target reads + 200 bp) and the average depth of coverage (Mean depth of coverage ) are also reported.Even though investigators are seeking experimental designs that generate robust scientific findings at the lowest sequencing cost, an adequate depth of coverage is very important in order to reduce the variant-error rate and the assembly gaps, and to obtain the correct call of variants, in particular for the He ones.45 It has indeed been demonstrated that for short Illumina reads a coverage comprised between 30× and 55× appears necessary to correctly identify SNVs and small INDELs with a proper degree of reliability.45,46In our experiment, the normalized mean coverage of the total targeted regions showed an average value of 53.89×, allowing very accurate detection of variants. Analysing the sensitivity of the experiment (Supplementary Fig. S1), which shows how well the targeted region is covered for reads at depths from 1× to the max depth (>150×), we observed that at a minimum coverage of 1× about 95% of the designed target regions resulted completely covered. Between 91 and 94% of the target was covered when a minimum coverage of ten reads was applied. At 20×, 76–93% of the target regions was still covered.Although Sequence Capture experiments represent a promising technology, only few studies have used Sequence Capture in plants (<20 in PubMed in April 2016). Probably the lacking of straightforward procedures for data analysis makes this technology still emerging. For this reason, SUPER-CAP, representing a user-friendly tool, could boost the use of this technology also for plant organisms. Moreover, in this study, the high rates reached for the capture parameters, in particular for the specificity (>74%), highlighted the high efficiency reached by combing an accurate probe design with a high performant aligner included in the pipeline (BWA), for which high confidence of sequence alignments has been already reported.19 This makes the performances obtained in this study in terms of alignment rate and sensitivity in line with performances reported for other organisms, for example humans.443.2. Variant calling and reconstruction of private sequencesSUPER-CAP allowed to detect 25,654 unfiltered variants in the targeted regions considered. Then the filtering procedure allowed to reduce the number of false positives/low-quality variants. Only variants exhibiting coverage higher than 6× and PHRED quality higher than 30 were selected. Even if a different threshold could be applied to the filtering procedure, we observed that in our experiment a depth coverage of six represented the minimum coverage to maximize the PHRED quality (Supplementary Fig. S2). Subsequent criteria were adopted to appropriately detect the number of He variants. A preliminary survey was carried out in order to estimate the number of He variants in accordance with the range of the AF (AF of mapped reads for each locus) (Supplementary Fig. S3). As expected, an inverse correlation between the range of AF and number of He variants was observed. This indicated that the set-up of the AF-range deeply affects the estimation of the He variants in the calling procedure. In order to make this sensitive phase of the variant calling easily customizable, we allow the SUPER-CAP user to set their own AF range. In this study, we set an AF range of 0.4-0.6 for the He variants, in line with a previous study in tomato.10 At this threshold, 86,120 variants in 14,116 sites were scored. Only 5% (4,970) of the total variants in 2,543 sites resulted to be He. Looking at the distribution of the He variants, we observed that they were not uniformly distributed across the chromosomes and genotypes. Chromosome 11 harboured the highest number of He variants per Mbp of captured region (Supplementary Fig. S4) while chromosomes 10 and 0 harboured the lowest number. Considering the 44 samples analysed, the heterozygosity ranged from 1.1 to 47% (Fig. 2), with a minimum value for sample 99A and a maximum value for sample 85A. Sample 85A showed an unexpected high percentage of residual heterozygosity, suggesting a possible sampling error of the plant material for this genotype (which could be mixed with other genotypes or to a residual segregation during the germoplasm conservation). For this reason, the sample was excluded from subsequent analyses. Figure 2Open in new tabDownload slideDistribution of variants detected for each genotype according to the type of variants.

A dendrogram built by using the complete set of variants shows the relationship among the genotypes.Figure 2 shows the number of variants detected for each sample, with respect to the proportion of SNPs and INDELs at both Ho and He level. Although INDELs are present at lower rates than SNPs, small INDELs represent functionally important types of genomic variation.47,48 It is reported that, compared with other sequencing technologies, Illumina does not appear to have high error rates in homopolymer regions.49 However, in this study the INDELs surveyed were obtained after discarding positions overlapping with homopolymers >7 bp, both in the tomato reference and in resequencing sequences. This allowed to avoid possible errors due to technical bias and enabled to collect a final high-quality set of variants.As a whole, the sample with the highest number of variants was 42A, which harbours >4,000 SNPs and about 1,000 INDELs. The sample with the lowest number of variants was 102A which exhibits 1,123 variants between SNPs and INDELs. On average, 1,357 SNPs per sample were scored, of which 6.8% turned out to be He. The average of INDELs per sample turned out to be about 600, and only 3% were He.The high depth of coverage reached in this experiment supported the detection of rare variants. It has been suggested that rare or low-frequency variants, which are not fully captured using other conventional genotyping technology, could largely contribute to explain the effects of some traits50 or to characterize their genetic architecture.51 In this study 5,441 Ho and 442 He genotype-specific variants were identified. Among these, 1,965 Ho and 216 He variants resulted still private variants when compared with external public repository for SNPs in tomato (360 tomato genomes42). This could be of interest when designing specific SNP markers or for studying the potential functionality of specific haplotypes in the landraces collection used in this survey. However, the rare variants identified alone do not seem to explain the phylogenetic differences observed (Fig. 2). The genetic divergence was associated with the high number of private alleles only in a few samples (i.e. 103A and 97A).The possibility of reconstructing private sequences from high-throughput resequencing data is still a challenge today.28 For this reason, the last step in the SUPER-CAP workflow allows to specifically insert the detected variants into the sequence of each sample. This step, which integrates the single information of the variants in a genotype-specific gene-based view, enables to obtain a necessary starting point for further functional validation analyses. In this study, a total of 16,254 regions (378*43), each including the gene and the related promoter region, were reconstructed. In order to easily exploit the combined effect of multiple variants in the same protein, reconstruction of the CDS was also performed. Future works, benefitting from this effort, will evaluate the combined effect of the variants for each gene in order to find relevant association with antioxidant content in tomato.3.3. Validation of variantsIn order to validate the variants detected, we performed a survey by exploring the available resources already present for tomato. About 8,600 variant sites detected in the present study overlapped with those reported in the genome resequencing data of 360 tomatoes.42 Most of the non-overlapping variants were excluded since they classified as rare variants in the experiment, being present only in specific samples. Moreover, by using nine common accessions, an analysis on the concordance of the variant calling was performed. Each of the nine samples shared a different number of variants, ranging from 191 to 985. Taking into account the Ho alternative variants only, an average of 95% concordance was found. Another validation was carried out by comparing SNPs detected on a tomato population genotyped using a SolCAP arrays,30,32 which included 7,720 SNPs. Only 170 of the 7,720 SNPs fall in the targeted region considered in the present study, since the targeted regions represent ~1% (378/34,725) of the tomato genes. Of these 170 SNPs, a subset of 97 belongs to common accessions and was used for validation. On average, a concordance >95% was observed. In most cases the discrepancies were genotyped as He either on the SolCAP array (2.5%) or in the Sequence capture (0.6%). When excluding the He cases, the similarity increased to 98%.3.4. CNV and PAVCNV and PAV have been recently reported as sources of important phenotypic variation in plants.52–54 The adequate depth coverage reached in this study allowed to hypothesize on the possible structural variations occurring among the samples considered. To do this, CNV and PAV analyses were performed to detect additional or deleted homologous loci of the 378 genes among the 43 samples, by analysing the normalized depth coverage of each sample. The comparison of read depths along the loci revealed at least 10 loci with a significant variation in depth in at least one line. In particular, nine genes (four Pectinesterases, two Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, one Reductase, one Inositol-3-phosphate synthase, one Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase) showed a CNV, and one gene (Dehydroascorbate reductase) showed a PAV (Supplementary Table S3). Three genes showed a putative reduction of the CNV (ratio <0.5) while six showed an increase (ratio >1.5). The very low number of reads captured for two samples (103A and 15A) for the gene Solyc09g056180 was associated with a PAV and we assumed that this gene was deleted in the two samples. In addition, an experimental validation by genomic PCR corroborated this result, highlighting that no amplification of the Solyc09g056180 was present for these two genotypes as showed in Supplementary Figure S5. The analysis of the coverage revealed a uniform high level of coverage across all the samples for seven genes (Solyc00g027770, Solyc00g282510, Solyc00g030510, Solyc02g075620, Solyc03g042560, Solyc03g036470, Solyc03g07 1860). Indeed, these seven genes showed levels of coverage ranging between 104.58× and 192.48×, representing an increase of two to four fold compared with the average coverage encountered among all the genes (53.89×). This could be due to the lack of regions in the current release of tomato. A high number of reads collapsing on specific regions could be caused by unassembled/misassembled regions in the genome.29 To validate this unexpected high coverage, we evaluated the depth of coverage of these genes in two further independent resequencing experiments (Heinz and Moneymaker) by using publicly available data (variation data from SGN databases). We observed that significant high coverage was obtained for three genes in at least one of the two resequencing experiments and one gene in both the resequencing experiments (data not shown). This corroborates that the reference genome could carry misleading sequences. An additional indication of this hypothesis, as also discussed below, come from the high ratio of He observed for these genes, showing that similar but not identical reads were mapped on the reference regions.3.5. Heterozygous variants into gene familiesHe variant assignments represent one crucial difficulty in sequence experiments.10,29,55 Since one of the causes of spurious He call was hypothesized to derive from duplicated genes, a specific investigation was carried out, aided by the high quality of variants detected by SUPER-CAP. Previous studies reported that false-positive signals could arise in regions with low complexity,56 or result from misalignment of multiple copies of genes, paralogues, or pseudogenes57 but, to our knowledge, no study has analysed the behaviour of the He variants in the gene family context.In our collection, 235 out 378 genes completely represent 25 gene families. In particular, 171 genes belong to eight large gene families, 40 belong to seven medium gene families, 24 belong to 10 small gene families and six are single copy genes. In order to estimate the number of He variants in each group we evaluated (Fig. 3) the average He density (number of He variants for Kbp) for each gene family. On average, a lower number of He variants was identified in the single genes compared with the gene family groups. Significant differences were observed at t-test between single genes and Large, Medium and Small gene families (P = 0.007) but not among gene families themselves (P > 0.05). Although these results evidence that gene families, despite the number of copies, are more prone to produce He variants compared with single genes, the high standard deviation detected showed that differences seem to be associated with specific cases in each gene family and not due to a general behaviour. It appears evident that in each gene family only specific genes showed a very high level of heterozygosity in almost all the genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S6). In particular it was evident that Solyc00g282510, Solyc03g042560, Solyc00g027770 and Solyc01g091060 (belonging to large gene families) and Solyc12g098090 (belonging to a medium gene family) showed a skewed rate of He variants. Some possible explanations of this result were hypothesized. In particular, exploring if neighbouring regions of these genes showed a similar rate of heterozygosity (by using information from the 360 genome project), we evidenced that a similar high rate of He variants was found only for Solyc03g042560 in a region spanning ~300 Kbp.

He density is expressed as the average number of He variants for 10 Kbp. Bar errors represent SD of the mean.Another source of false positive He variants might be due to duplicated regions found in the samples that are not found in the reference genome. In such cases, the variants will be due to reads from the two copies (or more) that are piled in the only copy found in the reference genome. Such biases could occur because of the limited number of genotypes on which the original reference sequence was based, or sequencing and alignment errors (Lander et al., 2001). Fortunately, these cases can be highlighted looking at excesses of depth of coverage. Three out of the five genes (Solyc00g282510, Solyc00g027770, Solyc01g091060) exhibiting a high He density showed a high depth of coverage in parallel (as also evidenced in the previous paragraph), generally doubled or tripled in comparison to the average value of all the samples. This proves that the tomato reference genome might carry misleading sequences for those regions and that the He calls observed are likely to be false-positives.3.6. Variants classification and annotationAs an additional step, the functional annotation of the variants has also been investigated by using SnpEff and SNPsift programs. The SNPs discovered were classified according to their type (transition vs transversion and insertions vs deletion) and the genomic region they were found in. A significant number of the SNPs discovered (6,098, 44.2%) were located in the genic region and, among these, about 21% were found within exons, 73% within introns, 1.73% within the 5'-UTR and 3.68% within the 3'-UTR (Fig. 4). The remaining 7,674 (55.8%) were found to be within the promoter region. Considering the number of variants per Kbp, eight variants per Kbp were found in the promoter region on average, while only 2.2 variants per Kbp were found in the exonic regions. Introns and UTRs showed more than double the number of variants per Kbp compared with exonic regions. Genic and intergenic variants were classified as transition/transversion and insertion/deletion typologies. Transitions represent approximately 64.54% of all post-filtered SNPs (11,495), with 44.2% (5,160) of them being located in genic regions. Deletions in average were more represented than insertions, particularly in promoter and intron regions. Then, the 6,098 variants of the genic regions were annotated according to their putative effect on the protein by using SnpEff v4 (Table 2). The goal of annotating variants is to provide a prediction of which ones are functionally relevant. Our detected variants were assigned to a diverse range of functional classes, with the majority (78%) classified as ‘modifier’, therefore without predictable effects being located in the UTR regions or in the introns. These may have little or no effect on the phenotype. Among the remaining variants, about 12% showed a ‘low effect’, since they were variants in coding regions that did not change the amino acid sequence (synonymous variant). About 9% showed a ‘moderate’ effect. These variants are predominantly non-synonymous amino acid changes (missense variant) and in few cases in-frame deletion/insertion. They are the most likely candidates for causal mutations, since they could alter the structure and function of relevant proteins. Last, about 1% of the variants were predicted to have a ‘high effect’. In particular, 14 variants were predicted to cause a frameshift: two of them a splice site acceptor modification, and nine and three a start or stop codon gain or loss, respectively. On average, we observed that the percentage of INDELs with ‘high effect’ was higher than for SNPs, since an INDEL may rapidly cause a frameshift in the sequence. The list of the variant with a moderate or a high effect with respect to the gene they affected is provided in Supplementary Table S4.

The variants selected or prioritized in this way would be highly preferred marker sets to be subjected to association studies using suitably larger populations, for which panels with considerable genotype and phenotype information has already been collected.30,32The authors wish to thank the Genomix4Life S.r.l (http://www.genomix4life.com) for the genotyping analyses performed with ILLUMINA Infinium Technology.Conflict of interestNone declared.

IntroductionLampreys (Petromyzontiformes) and hagfishes (Myxiniformes), which are known as cyclostomes or agnathans, occupy a basal position in the phylogeny of extant vertebrates and possess anatomical and developmental features that are quite different from those of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Therefore, these animals are excellent models for understanding the evolution of vertebrates in a wide range of scientific <U+FB01>elds, including genomics, immunology, endocrinology, neurobiology, and developmental biology. Molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that extant lampreys and hagfishes diverged from the common ancestors of jawless vertebrates ~480 million years ago (MYA).1–3 All extant lamprey species are classified into a single order, Petromyzontiformes, which is composed of three families, Geotriidae, Mordaciidae, and Petromyzontidae.4 Geotriidae and Mordaciidae are distributed in the southern hemisphere, whereas Petromyzontidae are distributed in the Northern Hemisphere.5,6 Their karyotypes are very different from those of other vertebrates and are characterized by almost all dot-shaped chromosomes (regarded as microchromosomes). Species of Geotriidae and Petromyzontidae have 142–184 chromosomes, whereas Mordaciidae species have 76 chromosomes.7–14 However, the chromosome number in hagfishes is much smaller and variable (2n = 14, 28, 34, or 36).11,13 The GC-content of 4-fold degenerate sites (GC4) in the protein-coding regions also differ greatly between lampreys and hagfishes; GC4 is much higher in lampreys than in hagfishes.2 These results suggested that drastic chromosomal and genomic rearrangements occurred in either or both of the lineages after divergence from the common ancestor of cyclostomes.13Highly repetitive DNA sequences are classified into two categories based on their genomic organization and chromosomal distribution.15 The first category consists of interspersed repetitive sequences such as short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), which are distributed throughout the genome. The second category is chromosome site-specific and highly repetitive sequences such as satellite DNA, which are associated with constitutive or centromeric heterochromatin. Chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences generally show a high rate of nucleotide substitution and are divergent between even closely related species.16,17 Thus, identification and comparison of site-specific repetitive sequences aids in tracing the evolutionary process of speciation. An EcoRI family of satellite DNA sequences identified in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus (Petromyzontidae) was the first reported in lampreys18 and was shown to be distributed in the centromeric regions of 12 or 34 chromosomes.14,18 This repetitive sequence has high AT content and contains short repeat units. Sequences from the same family of EcoRI satellite DNA were later identified in two other Petromyzontidae species Lampetra planeri and Lampetra zanandreai, and these DNA sequences were localized to only two chromosomes in La. zanandreai.12 In lampreys, molecular and cytogenetic characterization of chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences is limited to this EcoRI satellite DNA.The Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum, Petromyzontidae) is the most common and widespread lamprey in the arctic region from Lapland in the north to Kamchatka in the east and Japan and Korea in the south. To our knowledge, there has been only one study on the karyotype of this species, whose chromosome number has been reported to range from 144 to 162.19 In this study, we aimed to characterize the molecular basis of its chromosome structure through conventional and molecular cytogenetic approaches and to clone chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences associated with the heterochromatin of Le. camtschaticum. We performed conventional Giemsa staining of chromosomes, chromosome banding (C-banding and silver staining), and chromosome mapping of the 18S–28S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and telomeric TTAGGG repeats. Next, we isolated three different chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences, determined their nucleotide sequences and chromosomal distribution, and examined the conservation of these nucleotide sequences in other lamprey species. Based on the results, we discuss the process of chromosomal evolution in lampreys.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsThe Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum; synonym Le. japonicum, Petromyzontidae) was used for chromosome preparation and molecular cloning of repetitive sequences. After decapitation of two male and three female Le. camtschaticum, 5 ml of whole blood was collected from each individual in a test tube containing 20 µl of sodium heparin (final concentration: 10 IU/ml) (Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) from each individual using a syringe and was used for cell culture and extraction of genomic DNA. All experimental procedures using animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Animal Care Committee of Hokkaido University.2.2. Lymphocyte cultureHeparinized blood of Le. camtschaticum was added to Medium 199 (Thermo Fisher Scientific-Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 60 µg/ml kanamycin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a ratio of 1:5. After centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min, lymphocytes were obtained with a sterile Pasteur pipette from the buffy coat layer that is situated between the plasma and erythrocyte layers. The lymphocytes were suspended in culture medium [Medium 199 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma-Aldrich), 18 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin, M form (Thermo Fisher Scientific-Gibco), 60 µg/ml kanamycin sulfate, and 1% of Antibiotic–Antimycotic liquid (PSA, Thermo Fisher Scientific-Gibco)] and cultured in plastic bottles at 20 °C under CO2-free condition.2.3. Chromosome preparation and bandingLymphocytes were cultured for 6 days and exposed to 500 ng/ml colcemid for 2.5 h before harvest. The cells were collected by centrifugation (300×g, 7 min) and treated with 0.075 M KCl for 20 min at room temperature. The suspension was then fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and spread on clean glass slides using an air-drying method. For karyotyping, the slides were stained with 3% Giemsa solution (pH 6.8) for 10 min. The chromosomes were counted on printed pictures using a colony counter. C-bands were obtained by the barium hydroxide/saline/Giemsa (BSG) method.20 C-banding and Ag-NOR staining21 were performed on slides previously used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.2.4. Molecular cloning of repetitive sequenceExtraction of genomic DNA and molecular cloning of repetitive sequences were performed as previously described.22 Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and DNA bands containing repetitive sequences were isolated from the gel and cloned into vectors. After the nucleotide sequences of the cloned repetitive sequences were obtained, their chromosome distribution, genomic organization, and sequence conservation in other lamprey species were examined. For detailed information, see Supplementary data.2.5. Molecular phylogenyPhylogenetic trees of the repetitive DNA sequences were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method as implemented in MEGA 6.0 software.23 We used the Kimura-2-parameter model for nucleotide sequences and the Poisson model for amino acid sequences with Gamma distribution parameter a = 4 for rates and pattern settings. The bootstrap branch-supporting statistic was calculated for 1,000 replicates.2.6. FISHTo examine the chromosomal distribution of the repetitive sequences isolated in this study, 18S–28S and 5S rRNA genes, and telomeric TTAGGG repeats, FISH analysis was performed as previously described.24 For detailed information, see Supplementary data.2.7. Hybridization analysis of DNA blotsThe genomic organization of repetitive sequences and their sequence conservation were examined by Southern blot hybridization and slot-blot hybridization, respectively. For detailed methods, see Supplementary data.3. Results3.1. Karyotype of Le. camtschaticum and the chromosomal location of the major rRNA genes and telomeric repeat sequencesFigure 1A shows a Giemsa-stained metaphase spread of Le. camtschaticum, which consists of mostly small acrocentric or dot-shaped chromosomes and several pairs of small submetacentric chromosomes. The modal diploid chromosome number for 81 metaphase spreads was 168 (Supplementary Table S1). We collected chromosome samples from five individuals (two males and three females), and no differences in chromosome number and size were found between males and females. C-banding detected distinctive C-positive heterochromatin blocks on ~30 pairs of chromosomes (Fig. 1B and C). Large C-bands were localized to the centromeric regions of the largest pair of submetacentric chromosomes and the centromeric regions of three other pairs of chromosomes. Distinctive C-bands were also located in other many small acrocentric and dot-shaped chromosomes.

To identify the active sites of the 18S–28S rRNA genes, we performed silver staining on the same chromosome slides used for FISH analysis of the 18S–28S rRNA genes.25 Ag-NORs were observed in the pericentromeric region of one submetacentric chromosome pair, but not on the other four acrocentric chromosomes bearing 18S–28S rRNA signals (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Only slight variations in the size of the Ag-NOR signals were observed among the individuals examined (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The 5S rDNA signals were detected on a single pair of small chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1D), which was different from the chromosomes on which the 18S–28S rRNA signals and C-positive bands were localized (data not shown). FISH signals for TTAGGG repeat sequences were detected on the terminal ends of all chromosomes, and there were large differences in the size of signals between chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1E).3.2. Nucleotide sequences of the repetitive sequence families in the Le. camtschaticum genomeWe isolated repetitive sequences of the Le. camtschaticum genome by agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA digested with restriction endonucleases (Supplementary Fig. S2). Nine clones obtained from a 200-bp EcoRI band were grouped into the same repetitive sequence family, named LCA-EcoRIa (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The lengths of the nine fragments (LC149791–LC149799) were 200–202 bp, and the sequence similarity between the fragments ranged from 93.7 to 100.0%. The average GC content of the fragments was 47.5% (range 47.0–48.0%). Another EcoRI sequence family, LCA-EcoRIb, was isolated from a 360-bp EcoRI band (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The length of all 11 isolated fragments (LC149800–LC149810) was 364 bp, and the sequence similarity between fragments ranged from 96.1 to 99.7%. The sequences were AT-rich, and the average GC content was 41.5% (range 40.4–42.0%). Seven clones of the LCA-ApaI sequence family were isolated from a 700-bp ApaI band. The lengths of the seven fragments (LC149811–LC149817) ranged from 700 to 702 bp, and the consensus length was 702 bp (Supplementary Fig. S3C). The sequence similarity between the fragments ranged from 91.3 to 99.4%. In contrast to the LCA-EcoRIa and LCA-EcoRIb sequences, the LCA-ApaI sequences were GC-rich, and the average GC content was 57.2% (range 56.7–57.8%).3.3. Similarity of the repetitive sequence families to other nucleotide sequencesHomology searches using the three repetitive sequence families were performed using the NCBI non-redundant sequence database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Repbase (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/).26 The 200-bp LCA-EcoRIa consensus sequence showed high sequence identity with the nucleotide sequence of a BAC clone (KF318012) isolated from this species, with 94.5% identity at positions 6–205 and 97.6% identity from 206 to 371 in KF318012. The search also identified two partial sequences in a tandem repeat element, rpt200, in Germ1 (GQ215662) of P. marinus, which is a genomic DNA sequence that is eliminated from germ cells by a programmed genome rearrangement.27 The sequences showed 76.8% identity at positions 5,133–5,283 (named as the rpt200_1 fragment) and 80.9% identity at positions 7,489–7,556 (rpt200_2) in the rpt200 element (Fig. 2A). The LCA-EcoRIb consensus sequence showed 84.8, 89.4, and 89.1% identity to the EcoRI family of satellite DNA sequences in P. marinus (X92515), La. planeri, and La. zanandreai, respectively (Fig. 2B).12,18 Short repeats, such as centromeric motifs, that appear in the centromeric sequences of several eukaryotic species,28–31 were detected in the consensus sequences of LCA-EcoRIb as well as the EcoRI satellite DNA sequences of the three lamprey species12,18 (Fig. 2B). A search using the LCA-ApaI sequence identified a partial sequence of the P. marinus long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon Gypsy-26_PM-I in Repbase (Fig. 2C). A search using the InterProScan tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) revealed that LCA-ApaI shared 70.7% identity with a partial region of the integrase domain at position 4,252–4,954 of Gypsy-26_PM-I (Fig. 3).

Chromosomal distribution of the repetitive sequencesLCA-EcoRIa 2 (LC149792), LCA-EcoRIb 4 (LC149803), and LCA-ApaI 1 (LC149811) fragments were used for FISH analysis as representative probes of each repetitive sequence family. The results showed that the LCA-EcoRIa sequences were localized to the pericentromeric regions of six chromosomes (Fig. 4A), and the hybridization signals completely overlapped the signals for the 18S–28S rRNA genes (Fig. 4B and C). Hybridization signals for the LCA-EcoRIb sequence were observed in the centromeric regions of six chromosomes (Fig. 4D), which differed from the chromosomes bearing the 18S–28S rRNA genes (Fig. 4E and F). The LCA-ApaI sequence was localized to the centromeric and/or pericentromeric regions of almost all chromosomes. C-band positive bands were also located in the centromeric regions of many small acrocentric and dot-shaped chromosomes (Fig. 1B and C), indicating that the C-positive heterochromatin regions overlapped or partially overlapped the signals of LCA-ApaI sequence. However, the size of signals differed among the chromosomes (Fig. 4G and H). The signals were generally located in the centromeric regions on PI-positive blocks and/or in pericentromeric regions. Approximately 10 chromosomes showed large signals, and several large submetacentric chromosomes had more than 1 hybridization site. Two-color FISH analysis of LCA-ApaI and the 18S–28S rRNA genes showed that the LCA-ApaI sequences were located adjacent to the 18S–28S rRNA gene cluster but hardly overlapped it (Fig. 4I). However, the LCA-ApaI signals partially overlapped the LCA-EcoRIb signals (Fig. 4J). Figure 4Open in new tabDownload slideChromosomal distribution of the LCA-EcoRI and LCA-ApaI sequences.

LCA-EcoRIb 4 (LC149803) and LCA-ApaI 1 (LC149811) fragments were used as probes.3.5. Molecular phylogeny of the LCA-EcoRIb and LCA-ApaI sequencesWe performed phylogenetic analyses to examine the evolutionary relationships between the LCA-EcoRIb sequence and the EcoRI satellite sequences of other lamprey species as well as the LCA-ApaI sequence and Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons of other species (Supplementary Fig. S4). No sequences homologous to LCA-EcoRIa were found other than the rpt200 sequence of P. marinus; therefore, we did not perform molecular phylogenetic analysis of this sequence. NJ tree analysis of the EcoRI satellite repeats of lampreys revealed that all fragments of LCA-EcoRIb formed a clade supported by a high bootstrap value (100%), which was distinct from the clade containing the other three lamprey species (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Phylogenetic analysis of the LCA-ApaI sequences was performed using sequences encoding the integrase domain of the LTR retrotransposons obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; Supplementary Table S2), most of which were used in a previous phylogenetic study.32 A close phylogenetic relationship between the LCA-ApaI sequences and Gypsy-26_PM-I of P. marinus was supported by a high bootstrap value (100%; Supplementary Fig. S4B).3.6. Genomic organization of the repetitive sequencesFISH data revealed that LCA-EcoRIa is located in the spacer region of the 18S–28S rRNA gene cluster and tandem duplicated with the 18S–28S rDNA; therefore, we did not study the genomic organization of this repeated sequence. To examine the organization of the LCA-EcoRIb and LCA-ApaI sequences in the Le. camtschaticum genome, we performed Southern blot hybridizations using genomic DNA digested with AluI, ApaI, EcoRI, HpaII, MspI, and PstI (Supplementary Fig. S5). In a blot probed with LCA-EcoRIb, polymeric ladder bands of the 364-bp monomer units were detected in the EcoRI and AluI digests, which are characteristic of tandem repeat satellite DNA sequences (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Additional hybridization bands were observed interstitially in the ladder bands of the 364-bp monomer units in the AluI digests, which were derived from internal AluI cleavage sites in the monomer unit (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In contrast to the EcoRI and AluI digests, intense hybridization signals were observed at higher molecular weights in the ApaI, PstI, and MspI (HpaII) digests, indicating that these restriction sites are not highly conserved. Genomic DNA digested with the methylation-sensitive HpaII and methylation-insensitive MspI enzymes produced the same hybridization patterns, which indicates that their cleavage sites are not methylated.Hybridization with LCA-ApaI also resulted in a ladder of signals consisting of multiples of the 702-bp monomer in the ApaI digest (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The intensity of ladder bands increased for higher-order repeating structures, indicating that the ApaI site was less conserved in the tandem arrays. In contrast, AluI and MspI sites in the tandem arrays were highly conserved because no multimeric bands were detected in the AluI and MspI digests. The hybridization bands at lower molecular weight than the 702-bp band in the AluI and MspI digests were derived from the internal cleavage sites contained in the monomer unit (Supplementary Fig. 3C). The interstitial band positioned between the monomeric and dimeric bands in the ApaI digest suggested that the ApaI site was highly conserved in another additional unit of the LCA-ApaI sequence. The hybridization bands smaller than the monomer unit were observed in the MspI digest, whereas higher molecular weight bands were observed in the HpaII digest blot, indicating that the LCA-ApaI sequence was highly methylated.3.7. Sequence conservation of the repetitive sequencesConservation of the LCA-EcoRIb and LCA-ApaI sequences was examined by slot-blot hybridization using genomic DNA from four Petromyzontiformes species [Le. camtschaticum and P. marinus (Petromyzontidae), Geotria australis (Geotriidae), and Mordacia mordax (Mordaciidae)], inshore hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri, Myxinidae, Myxiniformes), lesser spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula, Scyliorhinidae, Carcharhiniformes), and medaka (Oryzias latipes, Adrianichthyidae, Beloniformes) (Fig. 5). Using the LCA-EcoRIb probe, intense chemiluminescent hybridization signals were detected in P. marinus, which is in the same family (Petromyzontidae) as Le. camtschaticum. No signals were detected in the other species (Fig. 5A). Using the LCA-ApaI probe, an intense hybridization signal was detected in Le. camtschaticum, and less intense signals were observed in P. marinus and M. mordax (Fig. 5B).

DiscussionHere, we determined the chromosome number and C-banded karyotype of Le. camtschaticum in somatic cells obtained from lymphocyte cultures. The diploid chromosome number was 168, which was not consistent with that reported in a previous study (2n = 144–162).19 This discrepancy may be due to technical artifacts owing to the extremely small size and high number of tiny chromosomes in lampreys. The chromosome number of Le. camtschaticum determined in this study was similar to those reported in somatic cells of Lampetra (La. fluviatilis [2n = 164], La. lamottenii [2n = 166], La. planeri [2n = 164], La. zanandreai [2n = 164]),8,12 and Petromyzon marinus (2n = 164–168).7,10,14 C-positive bands were distributed in the centromeric regions of ~30 pairs of chromosomes, which was more than the 20 pairs reported in La. zanandreai.12 In this study, the 18S–28S rRNA genes were localized to six chromosomes; however, the gene copies were only active in a single pair of submetacentric chromosomes. In other species, the 18S–28S rRNA genes were localized to the pericentromeric regions of four and two chromosomes in somatic cells of La. zanandreai12 and P marinus,14 respectively. These results suggest that the chromosomal location of the 18S–28S rRNA genes in lampreys is variable. However, the chromosomal location of the 5S rRNA genes has not been reported for any other lampreys than Le. camtschaticum, in which, these genes are localized to two chromosomes. The 5S rRNA genes are generally localized to a single pair of chromosomes in fishes, amphibians, and mammals,33 suggesting that chromosomal distribution of the 5S rRNA genes is conserved in vertebrates.We isolated three families of repetitive sequences from Le. camtschaticum, two AT-rich sequences (LCA-EcoRIa and LCA-EcoRIb) and one GC-rich sequence (LCA-ApaI). The LCA-EcoRIa sequence, which co-localized with the 18S–28S rDNA, showed significant homology with the tandem rpt200 repeat of P. marinus. This sequence is located in the spacer regions between the intact 18S rDNA and fragmented 28S rDNA sequences in P. marinus, which are found in the Germ1 sequence (GQ215662) that is eliminated from germ cells by a programmed genome rearrangement.27 In the primary spermatocytes of P. marinus (2n = 198) at meiotic prophase I, FISH signals for rpt200 and 28S rDNA were distributed on about 20/99 and 10/99 chromosome pairs, respectively, and the signals co-localized on some chromosomes.14 However, in somatic cells of P. marinus (2n = 164–168), the rpt200 signals were localized to ~14 pairs of chromosomes, and 28S rDNA signals were observed on only one pair of chromosomes, to which the rpt200 signal co-localized.14 This result indicates that most 18S–28S rDNA copies and several rpt200 copies are eliminated in somatic cells.14,27 The germline DNA loss in somatic cells has also been reported in the Korean lamprey (Lampetra morii, Petromyzontidae) recently.34 Therefore, the presence and co-localization of the rpt200-related LCA-EcoRIa sequence and 18S–28S rDNA in a small number of chromosome pairs in somatic cells of Le. camtschaticum might be related to a programmed genome rearrangement in this species.The LCA-EcoRIb sequence is a homolog of an EcoRI satellite DNA sequence that has been isolated from three lamprey species (La. planeri, La. zanandreai, and P. marinus).12,18 These AT-rich EcoRI sequence families, including LCA-EcoRIb, range from 362 to 370 bp, and the sequence divergence between LCA-EcoRIb and the EcoRI satellite DNAs is relatively low (10.6–15.2%). These sequences contain short repeats, such as centromeric motifs, which are also observed in the centromeric sequences of several eukaryotic species such as bream, trout, mouse, and human,28–31 suggesting that these satellite DNAs and the LCA-EcoRIb sequence could be important for centromere structure and function in lampreys. A zoo-blot hybridization revealed that the EcoRIb sequence is conserved within Petromyzontidae, and it is distributed on six chromosomes in the somatic cells of Le. camtschaticum, on two chromosomes in La. zanandreai,12 and on 34 chromosomes in P. marinus.14 These results suggest that the EcoRI satellite sequence might have been acquired in the Petromyzontidae lineage and amplified on many more chromosomes in Petromyzon than in Lampetra and Lethenteron through homogenization between non-homologous chromosomes, called concerted evolution (reviewed in Elder and Turner35 and Plohl et al.36).A search of RepBase revealed that the LCA-ApaI sequence showed significant homology with a partial integrase-coding region of the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon of P. marinus (Gypsy-26_PM-I), indicating that the LCA-ApaI sequence might be a LTR retrotransposon-derived repeat. LTR retrotransposons of the Ty3/Gypsy superfamily have been isolated from fungi, plants, and animals.37–39 The results of the slot-blot analysis indicate that the LCA-ApaI sequence is well conserved in Petromyzontidae and Mordaciidae, but not in Geotriidae. Mordaciidae, which is distributed in the southern hemisphere, has a lower chromosome number (2n = 76) than Petromyzontidae (2n = 142–174) in the northern hemisphere and Geotriidae (~180 chromosomes) in the southern hemisphere, suggesting that extensive centric fusions occurred in Mordaciidae.9,13 Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested that Mordaciidae is in a separate clade from Petromyzontidae and Geotriidae,40–43 which is reflected by the difference in chromosome numbers between Petromyzontidae/Geotriidae and Mordaciidae. The phylogenetic relationship among these three families strongly suggests that the LCA-ApaI sequence appeared in the common ancestor of Petromyzontiformes and amplified in Petromyzontidae and Mordaciidae but not in Geotriidae, in which no hybridization signal was detected by slot blot, although it is also possible that the LCA-ApaI sequence disappeared in the Geotriidae lineage.A draft genome assembly of P. marinus has been reported, and 7,752 distinct families of repetitive sequences were identified, accounting for 34.7% of the genome.44 The genome sequence of P. marinus will facilitate cloning of repetitive sequences from another lamprey species and their comparison, which is needed to provide further insights into the molecular basis of chromosome structure and evolution in lampreys.Accession numbersLC149791–LC149817Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (No. 23113004) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (No. 22370081) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

IntroductionTransposable elements (TEs) constitute an important fraction of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. These DNA fragments are able to mobilize in the host genome, contributing to chromosomal rearrangements and transcriptional modulation.1 On the basis of their transposition mechanisms, TEs can be grouped into two classes: Class I TEs transpose by a copy-and-paste mechanism via RNA intermediates, and Class II TEs proliferate via DNA intermediates using cut-and-paste transposition or rolling-circle replication.2,3 The vast majority of TEs produce target site duplications (TSDs) at their insertion sites, with some exceptions as Helitrons, a subclass of DNA transposons discovered in 2001 by computational analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes.3 Helitrons are present in a wide range of eukaryotic genomes3–6 and show several structural and enzymatic features that differentiate them from the rest of the TEs. They do not display terminal inverted repeats as other DNA transposons do, do not generate TSDs at the insertion site, and carry conserved 5’-TC and CTRR-3’ ends and a 16–bp palindromic hairpin located approximately 10–20 nucleotides upstream of the 3’ terminus.3,7 Additionally, putative autonomous helitrons encode a RepHel protein containing a replication initiation (Rep) and a helicase (Hel) domain. The conservation of the Rep catalytic motifs with the replication initiators of plasmids and ssDNA viruses led to the hypothesis that these elements transpose with a rolling-circle mechanism (RC), which is consistent with the absence of TSDs. Nevertheless, a study carried out in maize haplotypes identified helitron somatic excision events based on the presence of footprints in polymorphic helitron loci (occupied vs vacant loci occurrence in the genome),8 suggesting that this TE subclass may show both excision and replication based transposition mechanisms. Similar to other transposons, it has been described that helitrons can promote rearrangements in plant genomes9,10 and generate intra-specific variability by breaking the genetic co-linearity among haplotypes.9–11 In addition, during the transposition process, helitrons can capture and disperse gene fragments, producing chimeric transcripts.9 After their discovery, in silico studies have been carried out to characterize the nature of these eukaryotic DNA TEs. Despite several helitron-related finding being described and explained, the mechanism of helitron mobilization remained unclear because, until very recently, there was no experimental evidence for their transposition. Interestingly, a novel study reports the first experimental evidence of helitron insertions in cell culture, providing insights into the transposition and gene capture mechanisms.12 In addition, the finding of circular DNA intermediates containing head-to-tail junctions of helitron ends strongly supports the originally proposed RC transposition mechanism.5,12 Previous bioinformatics analyses have reported that helitrons account for 0-3% of the mammalian genome size5,13 and 1–5% of the genome size in insects.4,7 In plants, these DNA transposons constitute a variable portion, contributing between 0.01 and 6% among different species.3,14–16 In fungi, the presence of helitrons has been reported often as part of in silico comprehensive TE annotations of several ascomycetes and basidiomycetes sequenced genomes.7,17–21 In addition, a study in Aspergillus nidulans described the capture and duplication of a gene promoter during the generation of a non-autonomous helitron.18 In P. ostreatus, a recent study carried out in our group identified and characterized two helitron families, HELPO1 and HELPO2, which showed differential patterns of expression and distribution. P. ostreatus has been widely studied due to its agronomic importance and also due to its ability to selectively degrade lignin.22,23 The simplicity of its life cycle and its ability to grow and fructify under laboratory conditions make it an interesting model for fungal genetics. The P. ostreatus life cycle alternates between monokaryotic and dikaryotic mycelial phases containing haploid and diploid nuclei. Two compatible monokaryons can fuse and generate a dikaryon (the sexually competent form) in which the two parental nuclei remain separated during vegetative growth and fruit body development. The karyogamy (diploid condition) occurs only in the basidia at the end of the life cycle, immediately before the meiotic division that produces four haploid basidiospores. The two nuclei harboured in the P. ostreatus dikaryotic strain N001 were isolated by a de-dikaryotization process based on the protoplast obtained by an enzymatic treatment of the mycelium of the dikaryotic strain N001 and the subsequent identification of the monokaryons derived from protoplasts containing either of the two nuclei.24 This process yielded two compatible protoclones (monokaryons PC15 and PC9) bearing each one of the non-recombined haploid nuclei. The availability of these strains, as well as a meiotic progeny derived from the N001 dikaryotic strain, enabled further genetic studies of P. ostreatus. Specifically, the molecular karyotype determined the presence of 11 chromosomes24 that fit with 11 linkage groups described by our group in the genetic linkage map of P.ostreatus.25,26 These studies supported the subsequent genome sequencing of PC9 and PC15 protoclones. Both genomes showed an overall conserved macrosynteny, but the sequencing and annotation unraveled remarkable genomic differences in regions corresponding to TEs. In a recent study, 80 TE families were identified accounting for 2.5 and 6.2% of PC9 and PC15 genome sizes, respectively. The results of this work showed that the P. ostreatus genome is mainly populated by LTR-retrotransposons. Nevertheless, helitrons were the most abundant DNA transposons in the genome, and the HELPO1 family was among the most expressed TE families. P. ostreatus helitrons carry most canonical features such as the 3' subterminal hairpin and the RepHel helicase. Nevertheless, in contrast to plants and animal helitrons, their encoded helicase does not carry RPA or zinc fingers domains.17,27 They represent up to 0.35% of the P. ostreatus genome and are frequently displayed in polymorphic loci of PC15 and PC9. In the present study, we used experimental approaches to uncover the differential amplification dynamics of helitrons in P. ostreatus subclones maintained on solid culture under high- and low-subculture frequencies. In addition, we analysed the pattern of inheritance of helitron TEs in the offspring of 68 monokaryotic strains meiotically obtained from the dikaryotic strain N001. We provide evidence of somatic HELPO2 transposition in one of the analysed subclones and show that the HELPO2 family is under-represented in the progeny. A detailed analysis of two HELPO2 loci suggests that helitrons could be eliminated during meiosis by gene conversion.2. Materials and methods2.1. Origins of the P. ostreatus monokaryotic and dikaryotic strainsA total of 74 strains and sub-clones of P. ostreatus with different nuclear allelic compositions were used in this study. All of them were derived from N001, a dikaryotic strain used by our group as a model for mushroom breeding, genetics and genomics since 1994.28 The N001 strain was de-dikaryotized in 1999, and the two corresponding haploid-monokaryotic protoclones were recovered and identified as PC9 and PC15.24 Both monokaryotic strains have been sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute, and their genome assemblies and annotations are publicly available in the Mycocosm Database.27,29,30 For each of the three strains, a subclone was deposited in the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT) on the dates indicated in Table 1 and maintained under low subculture frequency (N001-03, PC9-99 and PC15-99, two subcultures per year); another subclone was kept under high subculture frequency (approximately 8 subcultures per year) for routine laboratory workup to the present day (N001-14, PC9-14 and PC15-14). In addition, we used a haploid-monokaryotic progeny of 68 monokaryotic strains meiotically derived from N001 in 1994 (68 mK; Table 1). This collection has been stored in our laboratory for 20 years under low subculture frequency. Description of P. ostreatus strains and subclones used in this studyaThis subclone was maintained under high subculture frequency from 1994 to 2003.

Culture conditions and nucleic acid extractionAll of the strains and subclones used in this work were cultured in liquid SMY submerged fermentation (10 g of sucrose, 10 g of malt extract, 4 g of yeast extract, 1 l H2O [pH 5.6]) in the dark at 24 °C under orbital shaking (130 rpm). The cultures were kept for eight growing days, and the mycelia were collected using vacuum filtration, ground in a sterile mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Genomic DNA extractions were carried out using an E.Z.N.A. Fungal DNA Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. After additional incubation with 4 µl of RNAse A (10 mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C, the DNA solutions were treated twice with phenol-chloroform (3:1), and the pellet was resuspended in 40 µl of nuclease-free water. DNA concentrations were determined using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA). The evaluation of total DNA purity was based on the Nanodrop™ 2000 A260/A280 ratio (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). DNA preparations served as a template for both real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and conventional PCR approaches.2.3. Design and validation of primer sequencesPrimers were designed based on the P. ostreatus reference genome sequences PC15 v2.0 and PC9 v1.0 (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/PleosPC15_2/PleosPC15_2.home.html), using Primer3 software.31 Specificity of primer pairs was verified in silico by two approaches: (i) BLASTN searches32 against P. ostreatus genomes using primer sequences as a query and (ii) manual verification of perfect matches between oligonucleotides and binding sites in PC15_PC9 alignments of the target loci. The validated primers were used to perform experimental analyses based on qPCR and conventional PCR. 2.4. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis2.5. Conventional PCR reactionsSeveral PCR protocols were designed according to the amplicon size and were run on a thermal cycler PCT-200 (MJ Research, MN). Biotaq DNA Polymerase (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) was used to amplify products lower than 3.5 kb. Each PCR mix was performed in a final volume of 25 µl containing 1 unit of Biotaq polymerase, 50 mM MgCl2, dNTP mix at 100 mM, and forward and reverse primers at 6 µM. Template DNA was firstly denatured at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of amplification (95°C for 40 s, 58°C for 60 s, 72°C for 1–3 min, depending on the expected product size) and a final extension cycle at 72°C for 10 min. RANGER DNA Polymerase (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) was used to amplify products longer than 3.5 kb. PCR reactions were prepared following the manufacturer’s recommendations in a final volume of 50 µl containing 4 units of RANGER DNA polymerase, 20 µM of specific primers and 20 ng of total DNA template suspended in nuclease-free water. PCR conditions comprised initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 57°C for 60 s and 68°C for 5–10 min (depending on the expected product size), with a final extension at 68°C for 10 min. For both protocols, negative controls were included using nuclease-free water instead of DNA template. Amplicons were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.8% w/v TAE agarose gels (1X Tris-acetate-EDTA), stained with 1:20,000 Red Safe™ (iNtRON Biotechnology) and visualized under UV Illumination. PCR products were isolated from the agarose gels, purified with an E.Z.N.A Gel Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) and sequenced using Sanger technology (Sistemas Genómicos S.L.,Valencia, Spain and Genewiz Incorporated, South Plainfield, NJ). Primer pairs used for the conventional PCR approach are listed in Supplementary Tables S2–S5.2.6. Detection of RNAi pathway genes in P. ostreatusKey genes involved in Quelling and Meiotic Silencing of Unpaired DNA (MSUD) pathways described in Neurospora crassa were used as a query for BLASTP searches (cutoff e value = e-5) against P. ostreatus PC15 v2.0 and PC9 v1.0 annotations. GenBank accessions of N. crassa proteins were the following: qde-1: EAA29811.1, qde-2: ESA42123.1, qde-3: AAF31695.1, sad-1: AAK31733.1, sms-2: EAA29350, dcl-1: EAA32662.1, dcl-2: EAA34302.3, and qip: XP_011393741.1. Conserved domains of P. ostreatus proteins with significant hits were identified using HMMER3 software34 with PFAM-A target database,35 as well as NCBI Conserved Domain Database.36 In parallel, proteins were clustered using all by all BLASTP (cutoff e value = e-10) followed by mcl37 (inflation value =2). Clusters of proteins carrying the same conserved domains as the query proteins were retained. Orthology between PC15 and PC9 proteins was inferred by reciprocal best blast hit.3. Results and discussion3.1. HELPO1 and HELPO2 families show different inheritance patterns in the N001 meiotic progenyTo analyse the inheritance patterns of the two helitron families present in P. ostreatus, we studied helitron segregation in a progeny of 68 monokaryons meiotically derived from the N001 strain (population 68 mK) by means of qPCR. The relative copy number of HELPO1 elements showed a normal distribution in the progeny (Shapiro-Wilks test, W = 0.978, P = 0.271), with monokaryons displaying RCN values ranging from 2 to 13 and a population peak showing 6–7 RCNs (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, results corresponding to the HELPO2 family showed a trend that did not fit with a normal distribution (W = 0.727, P = 5.135 e-10, Fig. 1B). In this case, although RCNs ranged from 0 to 9, up to 49 monokaryons exhibited only 0 or 1 helitrons, uncovering a strong bias towards the lack of HELPO2 elements in the N001 progeny. Previous studies carried out by our group indicated that the HELPO2 family amplified very recently in the protoclone PC15, whereas it is absent in the compatible strain PC9.17 The distorted segregation of HELPO2 elements might be the consequence of a specific genome defence mechanism against the invasion of repetitive DNA. In this sense, the HELPO2 family shows elements with high similarity among them and low transcription levels,17,27 indicating that it might be targeted by transposon-silencing mechanisms. In contrast, HELPO1 elements are more divergent and showed very high transcription levels.17,27 This fact suggests that this family is not targeted by genome defense mechanisms. A possible explanation for the unique profile of HELPO2 might be the very recent amplification of RepHel-coding elements in this family, evidenced by the presence of five identical full-length copies. These elements could be detected as foreign, invasive DNA and targeted by the genome defense machinery. To understand the striking differences found in the inheritance patterns of HELPO1 and HELPO2 families in the meiotic progeny, we reconstructed the pedigree of the monokaryotic collection along with their parental strains N001, PC15 and PC9 (Fig. 2), which have been used as a genetic model of study since 1994.

HELPO2 dynamics diverge in subclones maintained under different subculture conditionsThe abundance of HELPO1 and HELPO2 elements was estimated in several subclones of the monokaryons and dikaryon parental strains. These subclones have been stored under different subculture frequencies for up to 20 years, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Using the previously described qPCR approach, we observed that HELPO1 RCNs were largely conserved and consistently identical among the subclones maintained under a low subculture frequency (PC9-99, PC15-99, N001-03) and the corresponding subclones maintained in the laboratory at a high subculture frequency (PC9–14, PC15–14 and N001-14; P < 0.05, two-tailed Student’s t-test, Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the RCNs observed in N001 dikaryon subclones fit with the sum of PC9 and PC15 RCNs, as expected for an additive model (N001 is a dikaryotic strain that carries the PC15 and PC9 nuclei). In contrast, the estimation of HELPO2 abundance in the monokaryotic and dikaryotic subclones revealed an unexpected scenario. Significant differences were found in HELPO2 content within PC15 and N001 subclone pairs (Fig. 3B). More specifically, PC15-99 showed a RCN value higher than PC15-14 (23 vs 15, respectively), whereas N001-14 showed a striking 5-fold increment in comparison to N001-03 (11 vs 2 RCNs). In the case of PC9, both subclones lacked HELPO2 elements. Previous bioinformatics analysis reported a widespread distribution of HELPO2 copies in the chromosomes of PC15, whereas no intact HELPO2 helitrons were detected in the genome of the PC9 strain.17 In this sense, qPCR results confirmed the lack of HELPO2 elements in both PC9-99 and PC9-14 strains. Nevertheless, the differential HELPO2 content in the PC15 and N001 subclones suggested that these elements have been mobilized in the mycelia (somatic transposition) and accumulated in the genome as a result of a continuous subculture. The fact that the addition of PC15 and PC9 HELPO2 RCNs surpasses that of any of the N001 subclones reinforces the hypothesis of an amplification burst in both PC15 subclones. Previous studies have described an amplification burst of DNA transposons (IS30 and IS5) in bacterial subclones maintained for decades in stab culture, giving rise to genetic and phenotypic diversity.38 In addition, it is known that environmental stresses increase transposition rates.39,40 In this sense, the de-dikaryotization process underwent by the strain N001 in 1999 might have played a critical role in helitron increases, as protoplast isolation requires an enzymatic digestion protocol that could have triggered a stressful scenario leading to HELPO2 elements activation. We hypothesize that high subculturing rates may increase the chance of helitron transposition and accumulation. The 5-fold increment of the HELPO2 element content in N001–14 vs N001-03 supports this hypothesis, but does not explain the results observed in PC15-99 and PC9-14. In the latter case, the subclone maintained under low-subculturing frequency (PC15-99) shared a higher HELPO2 RCNs than its counterpart maintained under higher subculturing rates. This finding suggest that TE insertions without strong deleterious effects have a random chance of being passed to successive generations by clonal subculturing, thus bringing to the equation a randomness parameter. On the contrary, HELPO1 family elements did not show any sign of amplification. This finding, along with the uniform patterns of its inheritance found in the N001 mk68 meiotic progeny suggested that transposition of HELPO1 elements is infrequent in the P. ostreatus genome.

Molecular analysis of HELPO2 polymorphisms uncovers HELPO2 transposition eventsThe results obtained by the qPCR approach strongly suggest that HELPO2 is an active family, and the RCN increments observed in PC15 and N001 suggest that new elements of this family could be populating unknown loci. Previous bioinformatics analyses identified seven HELPO2 copies encoding RepHel helicases, distributed in 5 of 11 nuclear chromosomes of PC15 (Table 2). This genome-wide helitron annotation was carried out with P. ostreatus PC9 v1.0 and PC15 v2.0 genome assemblies17 produced by the JGI in 2005. Using conventional PCR, we re-analysed the parental subclone pairs to track the presence or absence of such HELPO2 loci. The objective of this approach was to confirm the bioinformatics predictions and to identify putative helitron polymorphisms between and within subclone pairs that could be the result of helitron mobilizations. A PCR strategy was designed to differentiate the two possible allelic states corresponding to the presence or absence of a helitron element in a given locus. We designed two primer pairs per locus flanking the left and right helitron ends. In each pair, one primer was designed inside the element, and the other was designed outside the helitron boundary, as shown in Fig. 4A and B. This strategy (outer/inner) allowed us to identify loci carrying HELPO2 insertions (“occupied loci”) with positive PCR products, but no amplification should occur in loci with no HELPO2 insertion (“vacant loci”). As expected, none of the PC9 subclones showed amplification in any of the HELPO2 loci (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, a striking difference was observed between PC15-99 and PC15-14 subclones: although the first one displayed HELPO2 insertions in the seven loci described in Table 2, the latter showed no amplification in Helpo2_I and in Helpo2_VIII_c. Intriguingly, both N001 subclones (N001-03 and N001-14) showed an identical profile to PC15-14 (Table 3, Supplementary Figs. S1A and G). This result leads us to hypothesize that Helpo2_I and Helpo2_VIII_c helitrons were transposed and inserted exclusively in PC15-99 subclone, after the de-dikaryotization of N001 in 1999. The experimental evidence of helitron transposition has been recently demonstrated in vitro using a reconstructed element from the bat genome.12 Our finding represents the first evidence of a fungal helitron transposition in its host genome under laboratory conditions. PCR products corresponding to Helpo2_I and Helpo2_VIII_c were purified, sequenced by Sanger technology and aligned to PC15 v2.0 and PC9 v1.0 genome sequences. The results obtained confirmed the helitron presence in the Helpo2_I locus, with the alignments spanning both external and internal regions of the HELPO2 (Fig. 5). Regarding Helpo2_VIII_c, it is noteworthy that the PCR product of the right flank displayed a size 0.6 kb larger than expected. In this case, sequenced PCR products could be aligned to the internal helitron regions but not to the external ones due to the low quality of the sequence. To discard that this phenomenon as a false-negative, we designed a second strategy to validate vacant sites with a positive PCR product. Using the PC15 sequence as a reference, primers were designed for regions adjacent to HELPO2 boundaries and homologous to the PC9 regions flanking the vacant site (outer/outer, Fig. 4A). The complexity of such regions (often carrying other transposons, especially Gypsy LTR-retrotransposons) made it difficult to find homologous regions between PC15 and PC9, yielding long expected PCR fragment sizes for vacant sites, ranging from 2,603 to 8,578 bp (Supplementary Table S3). To overcome this problem, we used a long-range DNA polymerase that allowed us to amplify vacant and occupied sites including PCR product size up to 10–15 kb (i.e. Fig. 4C). The presence of vacant sites was tested in all subclones (Table 4, Supplementary Fig. S2) including the discordant Helpo2_I and Helpo2_VIII_c loci in the PC15-99 subclone, despite the outer/inner strategy confirming the presence of HELPO2 in both of them. Using this approach, we validated all vacant sites except PC9 Helpo2_VII. This particular locus was further analysed with additional primer pairs and could not be amplified in any of the PC9 subclones, probably due to the inefficacy of long-range RANGER polymerase. Remarkably, the amplification and sequencing of Helpo2_I and Helpo2_VIII_c in PC15-99 revealed products corresponding to vacant sites, even though we had previously validated the presence of HELPO2 helitrons in both loci by the outer-inner strategy. Validation of these two vacant sites was performed by sequencing and subsequent alignment to the PC15 v2.0 reference (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results could suggest that cells with and without HELPO2 elements (HELPO2+/HELPO2-) coexist in hyphae of the PC15-99 subclone, giving rise to a mosaic mycelium. This fact reinforces the hypothesis of a very recent transposition of both elements, which were not entirely fixed or eliminated from the PC15-99 subclone in the successive subculturing performed after their insertion. In addition, these results provide indirect evidence that helitron was mobilized by replicative or semi-replicative transposition, as HELPO2 elements increased in PC15–99 without the excision of any of the other five occupied loci.

Distorted segregation patterns of HELPO2 in the N001 meiotic-derived progenyWe investigated the segregation patterns of the seven HELPO2 loci in 68 monokaryons using the previously described outer/inner strategy. As N001 is a dikaryon formed by the mating of PC15 and PC9 monokaryons and due to the seven loci being polymorphic (the presence of helitrons in PC15 vs absence of helitrons in PC9), it should be expected that there is a proportion of 1:1 (presence vs absence of helitrons) in the progeny. In contrast, the results revealed that the inheritance of HELPO2 elements was clearly distorted (Fig. 6). First of all, three of the seven loci carrying a HELPO2 in the PC15 strain (Helpo2_I, Helpo2_VII and Helpo2_VIII_c) were completely absent in the progeny. The fact that Helpo2_I and Helpo2_VIII_c were present in the PC15-99 subclone but absent in the PC15-14, N001-03, N001-14 and the whole N001 progeny (68 mK) reinforces the hypothesis of its unique (and recent) transposition in PC15-99, which according to this result, would have taken place after N001 de-dikaryotization (1999) but before PC15 genome sequencing (2005), as both loci carry HELPO2 elements in the PC15 v2.0 assembly. This observation demonstrated that these loci were vacant in the original PC15 and PC9 strains that mated in the wild to form N001. Following similar reasoning, a HELPO2 element must have been inserted in Helpo2_VII in the PC15 nucleus of the N001 dikaryon in the time that elapsed between the isolation of the meiotic progeny (in 1994 all monokaryons carry a vacant locus) and N001 de-dikaryotization (1999, PC15 carries an occupied locus; Fig. 2). Furthermore, PC9 helitron (vacant) alleles were consistently overrepresented in a ratio close to 3:1 in the remaining four loci. These results are in concordance with the biased distribution of HELPO2 elements previously found in the monokaryotic collection by qPCR (Fig. 1B). This scenario suggests the occurrence of a preferential selection of PC9 helitron (vacant) alleles during meiosis, or, in other words, an elimination of helitrons. To rule out the possibility that such a finding was derived from an artificially skewed progeny, we revisited the P. ostreatus genetic linkage map. This map was constructed based on the segregation of 214 molecular markers in a population of 80 sibling monokaryons meiotically derived from N001,26 and 68 of them were used in this study. According to the genetic map, 86% of the markers followed the expected 1:1 ratio. Additionally, the segregation of genetic markers surrounding HELPO2 loci did not show distorted segregation. Taking together, these data reinforced the fact that the segregation of HELPO2 elements is selectively skewed with respect to the expected Mendelian segregation.

Somatic transposition of HELPO2 generates mosaicism in P. ostreatusThe transposition of an autonomous HELPO2 element to a new chromosomal location in PC15-99 (i.e. Helpo2_I, chromosome I, position 619,761-626,150) was validated by two PCR strategies and reinforced by the presence of a vacant locus in the other strains/subclones, including the monokaryotic progeny. We integrated these results in the reconstruction of the pedigree of P. ostreatus’ strains maintained under different subculture conditions to propose a time-scale model that could explain the HELPO2 transposition in PC15-99 and the current HELPO2 profiles obtained in all the strains under study (Fig. 7). After 1999, a somatic transposition of the helitron HELPO2 took place in the nucleus of a cell of a PC15 culture plate and was integrated in the Helpo2_I locus by a copy and paste mechanism that could be triggered by the stress of the de-dikaryotization process. As a result, the transposition event originated a new HELPO2 copy in such a cell, which after mitotic replication led to the occurrence of mosaicism in the PC15 mycelia, displaying Helpo2_I+ (occupied) and Helpo2_I- (vacant) cells. Thus, subsequent subclones derived from the PC15 strain might have been originated from agar plugs located in different sections of the mycelium plate, thus presenting polymorphic loci. We hypothesize that the PC15-14 sample maintained during 20 years under high subculture frequency and used for routine laboratory work could have derived from a section of the PC15 Helpo2_I- cells. Alternatively, another likely explanation could be that Helpo2_I+ cells were also sampled but lost in the PC15-14 subclone after multiple subculturing replications due to lower fitness in comparison to Helpo2_I- or simply by the result of random drift. In contrast, PC15-99 still maintains the phenotype of a genetic mosaic. In this sense, the minimal subculturing frequency of this subclone likely favoured the preservation of both Helpo2_I+ and Helpo2_I- cells in the same mycelium net. The presence of mosaicism in basidiomycetes has been widely studied in Armillaria gallica, where variable numbers of nuclei genotypes have been detected in single fruiting bodies collected for decades.41 In this sense, it has been described that among-cell-line genetic variation in the haploid mycelium of A. gallica may confer plasticity to adapt to changing environmental conditions.42Figure 7Open in new tabDownload slideChronological model explaining HELPO2 somatic insertions in the PC15-99 subclone.

Allelic gene conversion may contribute to the elimination of HELPO2 helitrons from P. ostreatus progenyAs was previously described, the PCR strategies leading to an understanding of the inheritance patterns of the HELPO2 family in the progeny of N001 uncovered an over-transmission of the HELPO2- vacant alleles from the parental PC9. To understand if such phenomena were derived from a preferential inheritance or by helitron excisions during meiosis, we proceeded as follows: Helpo2_VI and Helpo2_VIII_b loci were chosen on the basis of their clear distortion segregation ratios. All the monokaryons carrying vacant sites according to the lack of amplification by the outer/inner strategy (58 of 68 for Helpo2_VI and 55 of 68 for Helpo2_VIII_b) were subjected to additional amplification reactions using the primers shown in Fig. 8A and B. The objectives were as follows: (i) to validate the presence of vacant sites with a positive PCR product and (ii) to determine the parental (PC9 or PC15) origin of such vacant sites as well as that of the adjacent regions (i.e. if they were inherited from the parental PC15 or PC9). For this purpose, primers were designed to amplify homologous regions of the parental strains carrying small indels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which allowed us to identify their PC9 or PC15 origin (primer sequences shown in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). For each locus, the four amplification products shown in Fig. 8A and B were sequenced and aligned to both PC15 v2.0 and PC9 v1.0 assemblies. SNPs were manually identified in the alignments and used to assign their parental origin. In 94% of the monokaryons analysed, the four regions studied were inherited from PC9, pointing to a preferential inheritance of the vacant site instead of a HELPO2 excision during meiosis. Nevertheless, a surprising profile was found in seven monokaryons (four in Helpo2_VI locus and three in Helpo2_VIII_b locus). Although the three flanking sites were inherited from the PC15 parental strain, SNPs of the amplification product corresponding to the vacant site (1,489 bp in Helpo2_VI and 907 bp in Helpo2_VIII_b) indicated that they were transmitted from the parental PC9 (Fig. 8A and B). These results might be explained by a mechanism of allelic gene conversion, which results in the loss of HELPO2 helitrons. To verify this hypothesis, the presence of gene conversion junctions were validated in the seven monokaryons by PCR as shown in Fig. 8C. To ensure the linearity of the short regions located between the amplified regions (shown in Fig. 8A and B as white rectangles), primers were designed to amplify longer regions, spanning Helpo2_VI and Helpo2_VIII_b loci as well as their flanking sites (Fig. 8C, Supplementary Table S6). Our results showed the presence of bands corresponding to the expected size, confirming the linearity of such regions and discarding the presence of rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S4). After sequencing, PCR products were aligned to both PC15 and PC9 parental strains. Interestingly, the pattern of SNPs/indels showed that gene conversion occurred precisely in the same sites in all monokaryons analysed for each locus (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that the mechanism leading to this recombination might have specific targets. The absence of HELPO2 helitrons in the monokaryons with profiles consistent with allelic gene conversion events suggests that this mechanism might be used to eliminate unpaired repetitive sequences (such TEs) during meiosis. Allelic gene conversion is a molecular mechanism associated with recombination in which a genomic fragment is ‘copied/pasted’ onto another homologous fragment. Little is known about gene conversion in fungi, although it is associated with non-Mendelian segregation ratios in yeast and mammals.43,44 In fungi, previous studies have shown that gene conversion leads to 3:1 ratios in heteroallelic crosses.45 A recent analysis of the recombination landscape in the basidiomycete Agaricus bisporus revealed a skewed segregation ratio from the expected Mendelian 1:1 in certain loci of the haploid offspring of 139 isolated single spores. In addition, results showed that crossover events (COs) occurred almost exclusively at chromosome ends including gene conversion in the reciprocal CO context.46 In 1982, it was proposed that gene conversion could be involved in the elimination of selfish DNA during meiosis when hybrid DNA structures are homologous but one of them displays a DNA insert present in one parent,47 as is the case with HELPO2 loci in PC15 and PC9. In such a case, a single-strand loop could be formed, being targeted by endonucleases and resulting in gene conversion with the elimination of the insert. Events of a model of gene conversion mediated by site-specific endonucleases have also been detected in different strains of Botrytis cinerea. The analysis of meiotic products obtained by crossing strains carrying polymorphisms permitted determination of gene conversion tracts that corresponded to unpaired regions previously identified in the parental strains.48 Our results are the first showing evidence of the somatic transposition of a native helitron in its own host and the meiotically driven elimination of an active helitron family in basidiomycetes.

Helitron elimination in P. ostreatus progeny: genome defence against invasive DNA?Eukaryotes have developed defence mechanisms to control the proliferation of TEs and avoid the potentially harmful effects of their insertions. One of the most impressive mechanisms of genome defence is called chromatin diminution, which has been described in several eukaryotes from distinct lineages.49,50 This mechanism selectively eliminates DNA and targets mainly young TEs displaying high frequencies and similarities.49 The molecular mechanism underlying chromatin diminution bears similarity to piRNA-directed transposon silencing in metazoans and requires an active RNAi machinery. In fact, it has been proposed that small RNAs could play an essential role directing such DNA elimination in the protozoan Tetrahymenathermophile.50 No study has described the presence of such mechanisms in fungi, but a handful of studies have shown the presence and activity of the main components of the RNAi pathway in filamentous fungi (Dicer, Argonaute, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, reviewed in Ref. 51). From the diversity of the fungal RNAi pathway, two mechanisms have evolved to control TEs at the vegetative (Quelling) and sexual (MSUD) states. The latter is of great relevance to our study as it involves the identification of unpaired DNA during meiosis by a trans-sensing mechanism. The origin of such unpaired regions are likely produced by TE insertions in only one of the two parental strains, such as in the case of the HELPO2 family in P. ostreatus. We screened PC15 and PC9 genomes for proteins homologous to those involved in N. crassa MSUD and Quelling and found a total of 18 genes in both strains: 5 argonaute proteins, 5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), 4 dicers, 3 RecQ helicases and 1 exonuclease. P. ostreatus RNAi proteins carry the corresponding conserved domains (Supplementary Table S7) and are actively expressed in vegetative mycelia (Table 5). Further experimental work is needed to understand whether the transcriptional repression and meiotic elimination of HELPO2 is somehow linked to the activity of RNAi pathway genes. Due to the ability of fungi to diversify and develop ‘epigenetic solutions’ to control TE proliferation, such a possibility seems to be an interesting field for future studies.

IntroductionDNA in every living organism is constantly exposed to a plethora of mutagens including radiation, chemicals or oxidative stress leading to induction of a variety of DNA damages. Among different DNA damages, single- and double-strand breaks are considered as most hazardous, if not repaired or misrepaired.1–5 Depending upon the multitude of genotoxic lesions, a variety of DNA repair pathways have been evolved, namely excision repair [nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR)], which deals with DNA damage at the level of base and nucleotides, and DNA strand break repair, which helps in the repair of both single- and double-strand breaks.1–3,5–7DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur when both strands of DNA duplex are broken in close vicinity. Improper repair of DSBs could result in genome rearrangements, loss of genetic information etc., while no repair may lead to cell death.8–12 In higher eukaryotes, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is one of the major double-strand break repair pathways.5,10,12,13 Homologous recombination (HR) pathway is helpful in error-free DSB repair and is active at late S and G2 phases of cell cycle.5,10,12–14 Unlike HR, NHEJ helps in the maintenance of genome stability throughout all phases of cell cycle.15–17 A backup pathway to NHEJ, often referred as microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) also exists in mammals. Till recently, it was believed that alternative NHEJ operates only in the absence of classical NHEJ;7,12,18–22 however, recent studies suggest that MMEJ can operate in parallel to classical NHEJ, albeit with low efficiency.22Penaeid species comprise the largest group of farmed crustaceans, with global production of approximately 3.4 million ton and Asia accounts for 90% of global shrimp aquaculture. Shrimp is the most important seafood product traded internationally; however, shrimp cultivation has been severely affected by a number of pathogens, mainly viruses, throughout the world. Based on the estimates, it was predicted that up to 40% of tropical shrimp production worth >$3 billion is lost annually due to viral pathogens alone,23 and ~80% production losses are due to disease occurrence in Asia.24 Besides, shrimp can also get exposed to various chemicals with potential mutagenic effect, which are either used intentionally for health management purposes or through contaminated water sources. Being invertebrates, it is believed that shrimp do not possess acquired immunity, and are dependent on innate immune response. Although attempts are on to identify defense related host genes, information on DNA repair pathways and DNA repair genes is largely unknown.MjRad23, a Rad23 homolog of NER pathway protein was identified and characterized in Marsupenaeus japonicus, a crustacean.25 UVB radiation-induced damage and repair was also investigated in another crustacean, Tigriopus japonicus. An increased expression of proteins associated with classical NHEJ, HR, BER and MMR was observed.26 In Daphnia, the DNA damage caused by UVB radiation is repaired by photoenzymatic mechanism, while NER was observed only at lower temperature.27 Complete genome sequence of Drosophila revealed presence of various critical DNA repair proteins depending on their sequence similarity to other species.28. While important NHEJ proteins, Ku70 and Ku80 orthologs were present in Drosophila,29 DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalytic subunit was absent suggesting an aberrant NHEJ/nonclassical NHEJ pathway in Drosophila.28Penaeus monodon, the black tiger shrimp, is one of the most economically important crustaceans. In the present study, we investigated various DSB repair mechanisms in P. monodon. We report that HR-mediated DSB repair is the major DSB repair process in shrimp, while classical NHEJ is absent. Although HR occurred through both reciprocal recombination and gene conversion, the latter was predominant. To our surprise, we could detect evidence for an alternative mode of NHEJ named as MMEJ, which uses microhomology for joining. Hence, present study reveals that HR is the major DSB repair pathway in shrimps.2. Materials and methods2.1. Enzymes, chemicals and reagentsChemical reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.

Shrimp were kept in 500-I FRP tanks containing sea water (14 ± 2 ppt salinity) with continuous aeration and maintained at 25–30°C. The collected animals were fed on commercially available pellet diet and acclimatized for 4–5 days before the experiment.30 Hepatopancreas was collected from a group of three to four animals and pooled together for the experiments (Fig. 1B). The animals were screened for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the most pathogenic and prevalent pathogen infecting shrimp, using standard PCR method before starting the experiments.

OligomersThe oligomers used in the study were purified using 8–15% denaturing PAGE as described before.31 5'-end labelling of the oligomer was performed as described previously.32 T4 polynucleotide kinase was used and incubated in appropriate buffer containing [<U+03B3>-32P] ATP at 37 °C for 1 h. The labelled substrates were purified using G-25 Sephadex columns and stored at -20 °C until use.2.4. Preparation of DNA substrates for NHEJ and MMEJ For NHEJ study, oligomeric DNA substrate (SCR19), of length 75 nt was radiolabelled with [<U+03B3>-32P] ATP and annealed with unlabelled complementary strand, SCR20 in the presence of 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA as described earlier to prepare DSBs bearing 5' compatible overhangs.33,34 The substrates containing 5'–5' and 5'–3' noncompatible overhangs were prepared by annealing radiolabelled SCR19 with cold oligomer, VK11 and VK13, respectively.35 Blunt ended substrate was prepared by annealing radiolabelled VK7 and cold oligomer, VK8.35For MMEJ studies, DNA substrates containing 10 nt microhomology regions were synthesized and prepared as described earlier.21,22 The complementary oligomers were annealed to generate double stranded DNA containing microhomology region. SS54 was annealed to SS62, and SS65 was annealed to SS66 to generate 10 nt microhomology region. MMEJ junctions were PCR amplified using radiolabelled SS60 and unlabelled SS61 primer.2.5. Preparation of shrimp hepatopancreatic cell-free extract (CFE) Cell-free extract was prepared from shrimp hepatopancreas in ice-cold conditions as described previously with modification.21,22,36 Briefly, tissues were minced with sterile scalpel and washed in ice-cold phosphate buffer saline. The cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT] and were homogenized in 100 µl of hypotonic lysis buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 M; aprotinin, 2 µg/ml; pepstatin, 1 µg/ml; leupeptin, 1 µg/ml) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The extract was centrifuged at 42,000 rpm for 3 h at 4°C in Beckman TLA-100 rotor after addition of 50 µl of high salt buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 1 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT]. The supernatant was dialysed overnight against dialysis buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M KOAc, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT]. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, aliquoted and stored at -80°C till use.2.6. NHEJ assayNHEJ assay was performed using plasmid as described previously.37–39 Supercoiled pUC18 plasmid was digested with EcoRI to generate DSBs with cohesive ends. The plasmid DNA (600 ng) was incubated with increasing concentration of cell-free extract (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 8 µg) and incubated at 30°C for 6 h in 1× NHEJ buffer containing 30 mM HEPES–KOH (pH 7.9), 7.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 50 µM dNTPs, 100 mg/ml BSA, 10% PEG and 5% glycerol. Reaction was terminated (10 mM EDTA), products were purified by phenol–chloroform extraction and resolved on 1% agarose gel. NHEJ assay performed using rat testicular extract served as a positive control. The gel was visualized following staining with ethidium bromide and image was captured using gel documentation system (UVITEC, Cambridge, UK).The NHEJ assay using oligomeric DNA was performed as described previously with modifications.33,35,39 Cell-free extract prepared from shrimp hepatopancreas was incubated with radio-labelled DNA substrates along with (or without) cold oligomeric DNA substrates (2 µM) at 30°C for 1 h (or as specified) in 1× NHEJ buffer. The reaction was terminated and the products were purified as described above. The purified products were resolved on 8% denaturing PAGE. The gels were dried, exposed onto the screen, and scanned using phosphorImager (FLA9000, Fuji, Japan). Analyses of data were done using Multigauge software (version 3).Radioactive PCR was carried out after end-joining reaction to improve the sensitivity of the assay. Following end joining of different oligomeric DNA substrates bearing DSBs either compatible or non-compatible ends, catalysed by cell-free extract of shrimp hepatopancreas (0.5 µg; 30°C for 1 h), NHEJ junctions were amplified using radiolabelled oligomer, VK24 (5'-CCGGTACTACTCGAGCC-3') and unlabelled SS37 (5'-TGCAGCATCAAGCTAGCC-3'). The reaction products were resolved on 8% denaturing PAGE and radioactive signals were detected as described above.2.7. MMEJ assayMMEJ assay was performed as described earlier.21,22,34 The reaction was carried out in a volume of 20 µl containing MMEJ buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM ATP]. The DNA substrates bearing 10 nt microhomology were incubated along with hepatopancreatic CFE at 30°C for 2 h (or as specified). Reaction was terminated by heat denaturing at 65°C (for 20 min) and the end-joined products were detected by radioactive PCR using radiolabelled oligomer, SS60 and unlabelled SS61. The reaction products were resolved on 8% denaturing PAGE and radioactive signals were detected using phosphorImager, as described above.2.8. HR assayIn vitro HR assay was performed as described previously, using two independent plasmids.38,40,41 Two plasmid constructs, pTO223 and pTO231, were generated by introducing mutations to neomycin resistant gene on pTO221 as described.40 Briefly, pTO223 was created by deleting a 245-bp (NarI) segment from 5' region of neomycin (neo<U+0394>2) gene and pTO231 was created by deleting 282 bp (NaeI) segment from 3' of neomycin (neo<U+0394>1). In pTO223, neo gene was flanked by EcoRI and SalI restriction enzyme sites. HindIII site was also present close to EcoRI at 5' end, which was absent in pTO231. pTO221 was generated using pBSKS where 1.5 kb of HindIII/SalI restriction fragment of pBR322::Tn5 containing the neo gene was inserted at the same restriction sites. pTO223 and pTO231 carried functional ampicillin resistant gene and served as substrates for the assay.The HR assay was performed using 500 ng of each plasmids (pTO223 and pTO231) by incubating with increasing concentrations of shrimp hepatopancreatic extracts (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 4 µg) in a buffer containing 35 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 50 µM dNTPs, 1 mM NAD and 100 µg/ml BSA at 30°C (or as specified) for 30 min. Reaction was terminated by adding EDTA (20 mM) and reaction products were purified using phenol–chloroform extraction. Purified DNA was used for the transformation of E.coli DH5a and plated over agar plates containing ampicillin and kanamycin antibiotics, and scored for transformants and recombinants, respectively. For all the experiments, no protein control served as negative control, which accounts for background recombination catalysed by E.coli. The recombination frequency was calculated as ratio of number of recombinants to the number of transformants per microgram of DNA.2.9. Restriction enzyme digestion analysis to distinguish reciprocal exchange and gene conversion Kanamycin resistant colonies containing recombinants were confirmed for functional neo gene by restriction endonuclease digestion. Functional neo gene can be formed by reciprocal exchange or gene conversion. In reciprocal exchange, a crossing over within the region between deletions neo<U+0394>1 and neo<U+0394>2 takes place giving rise to functional neo+ allele and a non-functional double mutant allele. In gene conversion a transfer of DNA from neo<U+0394>1 to neo<U+0394>2 takes place giving rise to functional neo gene. Restriction digestion of pTO223 and pTO231 will give rise to a 1.25- and 1.2-kb fragments, respectively, when digested with EcoRI–SalI and is indicative of neo<U+0394>2 and neo<U+0394>1 allele and a 2.9-kb fragment corresponding to vector DNA. In contrast, digestion of plasmids containing neo gene will release a 1.5-kb fragment that is indicative of the presence of functional neo gene.3. Results3.1. Cell-free system to study DNA repair pathwaysCell-free extract was prepared from hepatopancreas of healthy tiger shrimp, P. monodon for studying DSB repair pathways (Fig. 1A and B). The hepatopancreas was chosen as the target tissue in the experiment, as this is the primary organ responsible for absorption and storage of ingested material and involved in the synthesis of digestive enzymes and detoxification of xenobiotics. The organ constitutes 2–6% of the body weight and consists of hepatopancreatic tubules (Fig. 1C). Cell-free extract was prepared based on previously published work,21,22,36 protein profile was examined on a CBB gel, and used for DSB repair studies (Fig. 1D and E).3.2. Unlike mammals, classical NHEJ is absent in P. monodonTo test for the presence of classical NHEJ in the extracts of hepatopancreas of P. monodon, an oligomeric DNA based assay system was employed in addition to plasmid-joining assay (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In order to optimize the oligomer-based assay system, different parameters were tested using oligomeric DNA substrate bearing 5'–5' compatible ends (Fig. 2A). [<U+03B3>-32P] ATP-labelled oligonucleotides were incubated (30°C, 1 h) with increasing concentrations of hepatopancreas cell-free extract and purified products were resolved on denaturing PAGE (Fig. 2B). Results showed no joined products upon treatment with the hepatopancreas cell extracts, unlike the positive controls in which the testicular extract prepared from rat showed end to end joining of 75 mer DNA leading to both circular and linear multimeric products (Fig. 2B).21,33,35,39 Although hepatopancreatic extracts did not exhibit DNA end joining, it possessed efficient nuclease activity leading to degradation of substrate DNA, in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, unlabelled random double-stranded DNA was added to the end-joining reaction mix to reduce the nuclease activity. Although this helped in reducing the nuclease activity on labelled DNA significantly, hepatopancreas cell extract did not exhibit joining of DSBs possessing compatible ends even after incubating with increasing concentrations of the extract (Fig. 2C).

Analysis of purified products on denaturing PAGE confirmed no end-to-end joining of any of the DNA substrates tested (Fig. 3B–E), although end joining was observed in the case of rat testicular extracts, as reported previously.35Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideEfficacy of end joining catalysed by extracts of hepatopancreas of shrimp, compared with oligomeric DNA bearing DSBs with different end structures.

Oligomeric DNA substrates bearing DSBs (5'–5' compatible, 5'–5' non-compatible, 5'–3' non-compatible or blunt ends) were incubated with shrimp hepatopancreas cell-free extract (0.5 µg) and resolved on denaturing PAGE following radioactive PCR (Fig. 4A and B). Results showed efficient joining in case of rat testicular extracts (positive control), while no amplification of joined products was observed in the case of shrimp hepatopancreas extract (Fig. 4). Thus, we conclude that cell-free extract from P. monodon was unable to catalyse DSB joining through NHEJ, irrespective of the type of DSBs used for analysis suggesting the absence of functional classical NHEJ in shrimps.

Penaeusmonodon possesses detectable microhomology mediated DNA end joining (MMEJ)Since classical NHEJ was not detected in P. monodon, we investigated whether DSB repair can occur using microhomology as reported recently in rodents.22,34 To test this hypothesis, we synthesized DNA with 10 nt microhomology region and experiment was carried out as outlined (Fig. 5A and B).22 DNA substrates bearing microhomology were incubated with increasing concentrations of shrimp hepatopancreas extracts or with heat inactivated extracts for 2 h. Products were resolved on a denaturing PAGE, following radioactive PCR using labelled primer (Fig. 5C). Results showed a distinct product at 62 bp position (indicated by arrow) suggesting the joining through MMEJ (Fig. 5C). Although the efficiency of the joining catalysed by extracts of hepatopancreas was lesser compared with the positive control, testicular extract from rat; it was dependent on concentration of hepatopancreatic extracts (Fig. 5D). A distinct band due to MMEJ was observed, when as low as 0.1 µg of hepatopancreas extract was used. An increase in efficiency was observed with increasing concentration of CFE, and 0.5 µg of extract was noted as optimal (Fig. 5D). A decrease in joining efficiency was observed at high concentrations of CFE (1 and 2 µg), which could be due to increased levels of nuclease activity.

MMEJ occurs efficiently at lower temperature and starts within 2 min of addition of hepatopancreas extractIn order to determine optimal incubation time for efficient MMEJ catalysed by hepatopancreatic extracts, 0.5 µg of extract was incubated with DNA substrates possessing 10 nt microhomology for various time periods (2, 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 6 h). Results showed that robust joining due to MMEJ was observed as early as 2 min, however, incubation up to 2 h and beyond resulted in reduced joining (Fig. 6A and B). To check the optimal temperature for MMEJ catalysed by the shrimp hepatopancreatic extracts, the DNA substrate and protein extracts were incubated at various temperatures (4, 16, 25, 30 and 37°C). Results showed robust MMEJ at lower temperature. An increase in temperature to 30°C or above resulted in reduced efficiency of joining, most likely due to loss of DNA because of nuclease activity (Fig. 6C and D). Therefore, various lines of experiments suggest that hepatopancreas extract of P. monodon possesses MMEJ, although classical NHEJ was undetectable.

HR-mediated DSB repair is efficient in P. monodonSince DSB repair mediated through MMEJ results in deletion of sequence between microhomology regions, this could result in deletions in genome and hence genomic instability. Therefore, we were interested in investigating the mechanism by which genomic stability is maintained. To test this, HR-mediated DSB repair was evaluated in hepatopancreas extract of P. monodon using plasmid-based assay system. Two plasmids with two independent mutations at neomycin gene (pTO223 and pTO231) were used to evaluate DSB repair catalysed through HR (Fig. 7A). The plasmids were incubated with hepatopancreatic extracts in HR buffer and purified DNA was transformed in E. coli DH5a. Recombinants were scored on kanamycin containing agar plates. Recombination catalysed by the extracts, will result in the restoration of functional neo+ gene conferring resistance to kanamycin upon transformation in recombination deficient, E.coli (recA- strain of DH5aF-).

DNA treated with heat inactivated extracts served as the control (Fig. 7B). No protein control acted as negative control for bacterial recombination efficiency. Results showed efficient recombination catalysed by hepatopancreas extract, which was ~200-fold higher than the recombination frequency of no protein control and heat inactivated extract control (Fig. 7B). Importantly, the observed HR efficiency was >30-fold higher than that of HR efficiency of mouse testicular extract (Fig. 7B). Therefore, cell-free extract of hepatopancreas is proficient in HR-mediated DSB repair.Further protein titration was performed to determine the optimal extract concentration for HR-mediated DSB repair activity. Results showed a concentration (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 µg) dependent increase in the recombination frequency (Fig. 7D). We have also checked the effect of temperature on the efficiency of HR-mediated DSB repair. Hepatopancreas extract (0.5 µg) was incubated with pTO223 and pTO231 at different temperatures (4, 16, 24, 30, 37°C) for 30 min (Fig. 7C). The purified plasmids were transformed in E.coli and scored for recombinants as described above. Results showed the highest recombination frequency at 30 and 37°C. Efficiency of recombination was lowest at 4 and 42°C (data not shown), while it was moderate at 16 and 24°C. These results in conjunction with earlier results suggest that HR is predominant at the physiological temperature, while MMEJ efficiency is poor. In contrast, HR frequency was poor at lower temperature, whereas MMEJ efficiency was high.3.6. HR-mediated recombination in hepatopancreas extracts occurs through gene conversion and reciprocal exchangeRecombinant clones were evaluated for joining through reciprocal recombination and gene conversion by restriction enzyme digestion. During reciprocal exchange, a crossing over within the region between deleted neomycin gene, neo<U+0394>1 and neo<U+0394>2 takes place, giving rise to functional neo+ allele and a nonfunctional double mutant allele. In contrast during gene conversion, a transfer of DNA from neo<U+0394>1 to neo<U+0394>2 takes place, giving rise to functional neo gene. When digested with EcoRI–SalI, pTO223 and pTO231 can give rise to a 1.25- and 1.2-kb fragments, respectively, and is indicative of neo<U+0394>2 and neo<U+0394>1 allele (Fig. 8A). In contrast, digestion of plasmids containing neo gene will result in release of a 1.5-kb fragment that is indicative of presence of functional neo gene.

(D) Bar diagram showing frequency of HR-mediated DSB repair through either gene conversion or reciprocal recombination.Upon HindIII–SalI double digestion, release of 1.25 kb fragment from pTO223 was observed, which was similar to that of EcoRI–SalI digestion, while a larger 4.1-kb fragment was released from pTO231 due to the absence of HindIII site (Fig. 8A) (when digested, pTO231 gets linearized with SalI giving rise to single large 4.1 kb fragment). Upon HR, the neo gene comprising neo<U+0394>1 allele lacking HindIII site and right part of neo<U+0394>2 allele with SalI site resulted in the absence of 1.5 kb fragment, which was seen upon EcoRI–SalI double digestion. In contrast, during gene conversion, transfer of DNA fragment from neo<U+0394>1 to neo<U+0394>2 allele takes place, and therefore, HindIII–SalI digestion resulted in the release of a 1.5-kb fragment. Thus, the release of a 1.5-kb fragment during EcoRI–SalI digestion is indicative of the presence of functional neo gene (Fig. 8B), while a release of 1.5 kb fragment due to HindIII–SalI digestion is indicative of wild-type neo gene due to gene conversion (Fig. 8C). However, it is important to note that gene conversion between neo<U+0394>2 to neo<U+0394>1, cannot be scored upon HindIII–SalI digestion and therefore, observed frequency of gene conversion could be an under representation.These observations revealed that HR-mediated DSB repair occurred using both gene conversion and reciprocal exchange. Among the clones analysed, in >60% of the cases HR was through gene conversion (Fig. 8D). Therefore, our results suggested that DSB repair in P. monodon is dependent on HR and microhomology-mediated DNA end joining (Fig. 9). However, unlike mammals classical NHEJ was undetectable (Fig. 9). Figure 9Open in new tabDownload slideCartoon depicting comparison of major DSB repair pathways in mammals and Penaeus monodon.

DiscussionMultiple DNA repair pathways have evolved to combat DNA damage, ensuring survival of a cell.2,3,10 From prokaryotes to lower eukaryotes and to higher eukaryotes, several of these DNA repair pathways are conserved. Several DNA repair proteins also show high degree of amino acid homology across the living world. However, there are several organisms, where DNA repair pathways are unexplored due to various reasons including non-conservation of polypeptides or lack of complete genome sequence making the study of DNA repair a challenge.In the present study, we investigated DSB repair pathways in one of the crustaceans, P.monodon, using a cell-free assay system of one of the most important organs, hepatopancreas. Using the cell free-extract, which contains almost all the cellular proteins, we observed that NHEJ, the major DSB repair pathway in mammals is undetectable in the crustaceans. Interestingly, the more precise and faithful, HR-mediated repair is predominant and efficient. Although classical NHEJ was absent, a recently described backup NHEJ, known as MMEJ is functional in this organism. However, the protein machinery involved in each of these DNA repair pathway needs to be investigated.4.1. HR is proficient in P. monodonUnlike other DSB repair mechanisms, HR-mediated repair results in faithful joining of broken DNA without nucleotide loss. Although NHEJ is the predominant DSB repair mechanism in mammals, HR is the major DSB repair pathway in prokaryotes, and lower eukaryotes. Interestingly, we observed that HR-mediated DSB repair is highly efficient in P. monodon. Interestingly, we observed >30-fold higher recombination frequency, when extracts of shrimp hepatopancreas was compared with testicular extract. This is indeed remarkable and underlines the importance of precise repair, and maintenance of integrity of the genome. Although a hepatopancreatic protein concentration-dependent increase in the recombination frequency was observed, recombination frequency was highest at 30 or 37°C and the efficiency was significantly less at lower temperature. There are several DNA repair proteins present in Drosophila that are reported to possess sequence similarity with other species. It was reported that HR is the predominant DSB repair pathway in mitotically dividing cells of Drosophila.42We noted that although HR-mediated DSB repair could occur through reciprocal exchange and gene conversion, in the case of P. monodon, the most preferred pathway was gene conversion (>60% of the cases). Considering that cell type used in the present study was of somatic cells, in hepatopancreas, this is understandable. In E. coli, RecA is the major component of DNA repair system. In S. cerevisiae, Rad51 family of proteins are present, which are similar to RecA proteins present in E. coli.28 An ortholog of Rad51 has been found in Drosophila43 and another one closely related to human Xrcc3,44 but Drosophila lacks Dmc1 ortholog. Although, we have not investigated the protein machinery involved in HR-mediated repair in shrimp, it is very much possible that RAD51 homologs will be playing a critical role. Similarly, homologs of MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 also need to be investigated. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see whether RAD51 paralogues play any significant role in crustaceans.4.2. MMEJ is preferred over classical NHEJThe present study suggested that cell-free extracts prepared from hepatopancreas of P. monodon possess microhomology-mediated end joining, while classical NHEJ was undetectable. This is surprising, when one considers the fact that joining through MMEJ could lead to deletions in the genome culminating into genomic instability.12,18 It may be possible that NHEJ proteins such as Ligase IV/XRCC4, Ku70/Ku80, Artemis, DNA-PKcs etc., may be absent or expressed low in crustaceans, although it needs to be verified. Similarly, it will be interesting to look at the levels of MMEJ proteins such as Ligase III, PARP1, FEN1 in P. monodon.Previously, it has been suggested that MMEJ operates in those cells, which are devoid of C-NHEJ.12,18 Although, recent studies suggest that both classical NHEJ and MMEJ can coexist, this will be dependent on levels of protein expression. A synthesis-dependent microhomology-mediated end joining has been previously observed in Drosophila,45,46 which is consistent with our present study.In our study, we observed that unlike HR-mediated repair, which was very efficient at 30°C and above, MMEJ was optimal at 4 and 16°C. Although the relevance of this observation is unclear, it appears that this could be one way of promoting HR-mediated repair to ensure genomic stability. More studies are needed to decipher the importance of MMEJ in crustaceans, as it may facilitate evolution, since it could lead to changes in the DNA sequences.4.3. Does efficient repair protect crustaceans from infections?There is a direct connection between DSB repair and immunoglobulin diversity during adaptive immune response in mammals. NHEJ is critical during the rearrangement of V(D)J subexons.47,48 Hence, NHEJ proteins such as KU complex and Ligase IV play a critical role in the generation of antibody diversity. Therefore, it will be interesting to evaluate, whether efficient repair system in crustaceans can protect these organisms from infections. Previous studies indicate that, DNA repair proteins may suppress viral infections, in higher organisms.49 Studies suggest that DNA repair proteins may inhibit and can have an effect on retrotransposons and viral infections in yeast and mammals.50,–52 Furthermore, both Rad52 and Rad18 have been reported to suppress HIV-1 infection.52 However, these aspects need to be further investigated in shrimp.Choice of repair pathway takes place at several steps of DSB repair process. After initiation of processive end resection, NHEJ cannot take place,53 while a choice between HR and SSA (single-strand annealing), which is Rad51 dependent, takes place in Drosophila. P-element-induced DSBs were shown to be efficiently repaired by MMEJ mechanism in wild-type Drosophila and were unaffected in lig4 mutant flies.54It will be very interesting and significant to understand whether these DNA repair machineries can protect crustaceans against infections. It is possible that certain mutations in the repair pathways make them susceptible to a particular infection. In other words, it will be important to look at the DNA repair genes of crustaceans following viral infection to determine the cause of heavy mortality due to some of the viruses.Authors’ contributionsS.S., S.D., S.J.N., D.A., V.G., R.K.V. and S.C.R. conceived, designed and conducted the experiments, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.We thank M.

Altogether, we defined the core OET lncRNA transcriptome and characterized its remodeling during early development. Our results are consistent with the notion that rapidly evolving lncRNAs constitute signatures of cells-of-origin while a minority plays an active role in control of gene expression across OET. Our data presented here provide an excellent source for further OET lncRNA studies.1. IntroductionThe oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), the transformation of a differentiated oocyte into a developing embryo, involves massive reprogramming of gene expression where zygotic genome activation (ZGA) initiates production of zygotic mRNA to replace maternal RNAs in control of development. Although changes of mRNA and small RNA populations during OET were characterized in a considerable detail (reviewed in1), much less is known about composition and temporal changes of spliced long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs (reviewed for example in2–5) add another layer to the transcriptome complexity. LncRNAs are an arbitrary category adopted for spliced transcripts not encoding proteins that are longer than 200 nucleotides (nt). LncRNAs represent an assorted group of RNAs implicated in transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic regulations or, importantly, without any apparent functions. LncRNAs evolve rapidly, showing little if any sequence conservation.6 It is assumed that a relatively minor fraction of these transcripts is functional while the rest might represent transcriptional noise and/or lncRNAs that have appeared recently in evolution and have not acquired a function (reviewed in2). However, specific lncRNAs are functionally important for different processes, which include the maintenance and induction of stem cell pluripotency (reviewed in7).Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based studies provided partial insights into some aspects of lncRNA biology during the mammalian OET. Upon single-cell RNA profiling of human preimplantation embryos, Yan et al.8 reported 2,733 novel expressed lncRNAs. Zhang et al.9 used single-cell SOLiD NGS data from OET stages and reported 5,563 novel lncRNAs. Hamazaki et al.10 studied a specific lncRNA group termed promoter associated non-coding RNAs (pancRNAs) in ovulated oocytes and two-cell zygotes. So far, the most detailed analysis of OET lncRNAs has been provided by Veselovska et al.,11 who produced de novo transcriptome assembly that included lncRNAs. However, their main research focus was the contribution of transcription to the DNA methylation landscape and not a thorough annotation and analysis of lncRNAs.Understanding the composition of maternal and zygotic non-coding RNA pools is pre-requisite for understanding their biological roles during OET. In this study, we sought to provide a highly reliable set of de novo assembled lncRNAs present during OET (referred to as OET lncRNAs hereafter) and perform its characterization in terms of structure and expression. Accordingly, we identified, annotated, and characterized 1,600 OET lncRNA loci, including their transcriptional and post-transcriptional temporal dynamics. OET lncRNAs exhibited typical features of lncRNAs: lower expression levels than mRNAs, highly variable splicing, and restricted expression. Remarkably, the OET lncRNA expression largely falls into mutually exclusive maternal and zygotic expression patterns but rarely into the maternal-zygotic expression, which is common for mRNAs. Finally, we produced CRISPR-mediated knockouts of two maternal conserved lncRNAs without an effect on fertility.2. Methods2.1. RNA extraction, preparation of the NGS library and sequencingTotal RNA was extracted from 3,000 fully grown germinal vesicle (GV)-intact oocytes obtained from C57BL6/J mice, respectively, using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PolyA RNA was isolated by using mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; cat no. 610.06). High-throughput sequencing of size-selected RNA (>200 nt) was performed using Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina) and 76-nt paired-end-sequencing reads as described previously in.12 The complete set of NGS data is available in the Array Express database under accession IDs E-MTAB-2950 and E-MTAB-4775.2.2. Analysis of lncRNA expression in oocytes and early embryos by real-time PCROocytes and early embryos were obtained from C57Bl/6 mice as described previously in.13,14 Resumption of meiosis during collection of GV oocytes was prevented with 0.2 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX, Sigma). RNA from a chosen number of oocytes or early embryos was released upon incubation in water with RNase inhibitor for 5 min at 85 °C. RNA was reverse-transcribed using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) was used for qPCR. The primers and PCR conditions are shown in the Supplementary Table S5.2.3. Production of lncRNA knockout modelsLncRNA knockout models were produced in the Transgenic Unit of the Institute of Molecular Genetics ASCR, Czech Centre for Phenogenomics using Cas9-mediated deletion of lncRNA promoters (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8).15,16 All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committees (project number 58-2015) and were carried out in accordance with the law.Sequences of guide RNAs are listed in the Table S5. To produce guide RNAs, synthetic 128 nt guide RNA templates including T7 promoter, 18 nt sgRNA and tracrRNA sequences were amplified using T7 and TracrRNA primers (Supplementary Table S5). Guide RNAs were produced in vitro using the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit, and purified using the mirPremier microRNA Isolation Kit (Sigma). The Cas9 mRNA was synthesized from pSp Cas9-puro plasmid using Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit, and purified using the Qiagen RNasy mini kit. A sample for microinjection was prepared by mixing two guide RNAs in ultra-pure water at a concentration of 25 ng/µl for each one together with Cas9 RNA (100 ng/µl) . Five picoliters of the microinjection mixture were injected into male pronuclei of C57Bl/6 zygotes and transferred into pseudopregnant recipient mice. PCR genotyping was performed on tail biopsies from 4 weeks-old animals. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S5.2.4. Bioinformatics analysesMapping of NGS data was performed as described previously in.12 Briefly, adapters were removed using the Trimmomatic software (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170). The filtered reads were mapped onto the mm9/NCBI37 version of the mouse genome using the STAR mapper (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635) and the genome index was constructed with the addition of the mm9 Ensembl gene annotation, downloaded on 20 September 2013 from the Ensembl database. The dynamic ranges of read counts permitted us to use counts per million normalization for downstream analyses as they did not vary significantly across experiments.12 Data were visualized in the UCSC browser by constructing bigWig tracks using the Bedtools software (10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033).For assembling lncRNA transcript models, we used 76-nt paired end (76PE) non-directional NGS data with depths 33–58 × 106 sequence reads/sample from oocytes and early embryos (Supplementary Table S1). Except of fully grown GV-intact oocytes data, other NGS datasets were published.12For transcript model assembly, we combined total RNA NGS datasets (Supplementary Table S1) into three sets as follows: (i) the maternal set: fully grown GV oocyte and MII egg NGS data, (ii) the ZGA (zygotic) set: two- and four-cell NGS data, and (iii) the late preimplantation (embryonic) set: morula and blastocyst NGS data. Transcript model assembly was performed for each set separately to reduce artifacts from degraded maternal RNAs and to achieve accurate assembly of overlapping sense and antisense transcripts. We tested several combinations of data pooling including pooling with published shorter single-end read NGS data (e.g.17,18). However, the aforementioned grouping of 76PE samples into three independent sets yielded by far the best results in assembling transcript models of a diagnostic set of 20 lncRNA loci. Although addition of published 35SE sets would increase the sequencing depth and reveal additional lncRNAs, it also introduced numerous artifacts into transcript models when compared with transcript assembly based on 76PE sets, which yielded the best exon-intron junction prediction.To build transcript models from NGS data, we used Scripture,19 which performed better than Cufflinks or Stringtie in assembling the aforementioned diagnostic set of annotated and novel lncRNAs (data not shown). Transcript models generated by Scripture were refined to eliminate various artifacts. We filled introns <20 nt length and removed transcript models containing introns >250 kb, which were typically repeat-derived artifacts and disturbed assembly of transcript model clusters. We also removed single-exon transcripts and transcripts shorter than 200 nucleotides.Refined transcript models in each developmental set were then used to build transcript clusters where each lncRNA cluster accommodated all transcript models with the same orientation sharing at least one splice site. Thus, a lncRNA cluster represents a locus containing a group of exons found in clustered transcript models. Transcript models in clusters were subsequently analysed for coding potential by CPAT20 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Building clusters and CPAT pre-filtering performed separately on the three sets was chosen because it simplified data management, allowing to work in parallel with smaller volumes of developmentally relevant data. All clusters containing any CPAT positive transcript model were removed from the lncRNA annotation in order to eliminate transcript model artifacts derived from poorly assembled mRNAs. Although one promoter could produce a shorter lncRNA and a longer mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2), we decided to remove entire clusters ‘contaminated’ with any CPAT-positive transcript models. In any case, lncRNAs in such clusters overlap with mRNAs in sense, which represented an lncRNA category omitted from our annotation and further analysis.Next, we merged clusters containing the same transcript models from the three NGS sets. We first merged pools from the maternal lncRNA NGS set with the ZGA lncRNAs NGS set while we removed partial ZGA transcript models matching maternal transcript models as they typically came from poor assembly of degraded maternal transcripts. Then we added transcript models from late pre-implantation NGS clusters and generated a single non-redundant set of transcript model clusters for final refining.Transcript models in each cluster were further refined by revising terminal exon predictions since we noticed that Scripture tends to produce truncated terminal exon variants despite an apparent support from NGS or expressed sequence tag (EST) data. Thus, when Scripture predicted terminal exon variants sharing the same splice donor or splice acceptor, we calculated read densities (FPKM - fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) for those exon variants and if they did not differ >2-fold, we collapsed shorter exon variants to retain only the longer one as the terminal exon for transcript models. We also refined predicted transcript models using mm9-annotated ESTs, which originated from oocytes and early embryos. We compared the annotated exon-intron structure of these ESTs with our transcript models and annotated lncRNAs. Truncated/partial transcript models were extended according to ESTs if both the ESTs and previously annotated lncRNAs supported such extensions. Further refining included the following filtering steps: transcript models were removed, which contained sequences of known highly abundant non-coding RNAs (e.g. rRNA, U1-U7 RNA, 7SLRNA, SSU-rRNA). We also removed all clusters where >75% of sequences were recognized by Repeatmasker.21 Although some true lncRNAs are made of >75% of repetitive sequences, repeats were causing artifacts yielding spliced transcript models (Supplementary Fig. S4). We also added a filter to eliminate strange artifacts where sequence reads derived from exons of a highly abundant mRNA were assembled into an antisense lncRNA transcript model, not following the canonical splice donor and acceptor sequence rules. Finally, refined transcript models were analysed again for coding potential using CPAT and clusters carrying CPAT positive transcript models were removed (Supplementary Fig. S1).Then, we individually assessed all clusters which passed filtering until this point but their highest exon maximum FPKM in any of the developmental stages was <1 and we retained those, which seemed to be supported by NGS data display in the UCSC browser (476 transcript clusters were retained). The expression of each cluster was calculated as the maximum exon FPKM, after masking the parts of lncRNA exons, which overlapped exons of protein-coding genes.The clusters (and their individual transcript models as well) were classified in six categories according to their positions in the genome (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S2). The classification system used a simple dichotomic annotation based on boundaries of clusters (transcript models) and their orientations relative to transcripts from protein-coding genes. If there was no overlap, clusters were considered Intergenic. When there was an overlap, we distinguished sense and antisense overlap and we further recognized whether or not an overlap formed between mature (spliced) transcripts. When one lncRNA was associated with more than gene, we opted for classifying such lncRNAs simply as Complex (in total, there were 30 such loci). Clusters from the two sense categories were omitted from the further analysis because they contained too many artifacts that were hindering the annotation effort.

For example, 19 lncRNA clusters contain transcript models assembled in all three developmental sets while 973 clusters comprise of exclusively oocyte-derived transcript models.We considered an lncRNA locus to be supported by a previous annotation9,11 if it shared at least one exon-exon junction with an annotated transcript model. For analysing exon counts and locus lengths, we grouped all the overlapping transcripts for each OET lncRNA locus and calculated the number of unique exons in the transcripts and the length of the transcript group (defined as the distance between the 5' end of the most upstream 5' exon in the transcript group to the 3' end of the most downstream exon in the transcript group). We then compared the number of unique exons and length of the transcript groups to the number of unique exons and the length of our OET lncRNA loci (Supplementary Fig. S3).The NGS data from Stein et al.22 were mapped to the mm9 version of the mouse genome using the STAR aligner, with the following parameters: –outFilterMultimapNmax 10, –out FilterMismatch Nover Lmax 0.2, –sjdbScore 2. The genome was indexed, prior to mapping, with the addition of the mm9 Ensembl gene annotation. For each gene we chose the transcript model with the higher number of exons and counted the reads using the SummarizeOverlaps function. The estimated expression levels per transcript were obtained by normalizing for the library size using the sizeFactors from the DESeq2 package, and the transcript width.Mapping small RNAs from Tam et al.23 was performed as described previously in.24 Data were visualized in the UCSC browser by constructing bigWig tracks using the Bedtools software (10.1093/bioinformatics/btq033).3. Results and Discussion3.1. Identification of OET lncRNAsWe built lncRNA annotation from 76PE non-directional NGS of total non-amplified RNA from seven different OET stages in mice (Fig. 1A). Total RNA NGS enabled us to explore the entire lncRNA population including non-polyadenylated lncRNAs. Given the depth of our NGS datasets (~4–9 × 106 mapped non-rRNA reads, Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1A), we focused on annotating well-expressed lncRNAs to reduce annotation artifacts emerging when annotating as many loci as possible. The annotation pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 1B) started with grouping NGS data into three biologically relevant datasets representing distinct types of OET transcriptomes: (i) maternal, containing data (~16.1 × 106 mapped non-rRNA reads) from ovarian GV oocytes and ovulated MII eggs. (ii) ZGA (also referred to as ‘zygotic’)—containing two- and four-cell embryo data (~10.0 × 106 mapped non-rRNA reads), and (iii) late preimplantation embryo (also referred to as ‘embryonic’)—containing morula and blastocyst data (~9.3 × 106 mapped non-rRNA reads). The maternal, zygotic, and embryonic datasets were used for a separate transcript model assembly, filtering, and clustering (a cluster is a group of exons from clustered transcript models from one locus). Clusters containing a transcript model with a predicted coding potential were removed. Clusters from the maternal, zygotic, and embryonic datasets were merged and refined (including a manual inspection of ~1,200 clusters) to produce a non-redundant set of transcript model clusters. In total, we obtained 1,600 lncRNA clusters classified into four categories according to their positions relative to protein-coding genes (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S2). 1,142 (71%) lncRNA loci were intergenic, 30 (2%) overlapped with more than one protein-coding gene, 193 (12%) resided within introns, and 235 (15%) contained transcript models antisense overlapping with mRNA exons.The majority of the 1,600 lncRNA clusters were assembled from the maternal NGS set (Fig. 1D), including 973 clusters assembled exclusively from the maternal set. Around 600 clusters were assembled from the ZGA set (362 clusters exclusively from the ZGA set), while mere 93 lncRNA clusters were assembled from the embryonic set (only 24 of those clusters were exclusively from the embryonic set). This result, which is discordant with the high count of lncRNAs annotated from ESCs,25,26 can be explained by sample heterogeneity and changing RNA content during early development. Abundance of lncRNAs specific for embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in morulae and blastocysts would be diluted by transcriptomes of non-expressing cells. Furthermore, the embryonic set had a lower depth than the maternal set (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1) while a blastocyst has ~ three times more total RNA (~1.5 ng) than an oocyte (~0.5 ng).27 Accordingly, a transcript with an identical copy number in the blastocyst and the oocyte has a three times lower FPKM value in the blastocyst. Thus, the same FPKM cut-off value is more stringent when selecting the blastocyst-expressed genes. This would especially affect the analysis of low-level transcripts such as lncRNAs.Of the 1,600 clusters, 350 (22%) clusters contained exons or transcript models annotated in the ENCODE or Refseq databases (Fig. 1E). A comparison with recently published 19,617 non-coding transcript models11 and 5,563 lncRNA transcripts from 3,492 loci9 showed that 24% (390 lncRNA loci) were not annotated by either of these studies (Supplementary Table S2), 44% were supported exclusively by Veselovska et al.,11 7% exclusively by Zhang et al.,9 and 25% by both datasets. Thus, almost 70% of the clusters overlapped with Veselovska et al. who used a much deeper maternal NGS set and annotated longer transcript models with more splicing variants (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, lncRNA loci by Zhang et al. were shorter and had fewer exons per transcript and per lncRNA locus (Supplementary Fig. S3).Finally, we examined expression of annotated lncRNA loci (clusters) in other available data: SOLiD NGS data by Park et al., which we used previously in,12,17 and unpublished data by Yu et al. (GSE71257) from GV oocytes, MII eggs, one-, and two-cell stages sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. We found that only 34 of our lncRNA clusters produced transcript models with expression values <1 FPKM (maximum exon FPKM for each OET lncRNA locus); expression of four clusters was not detected at all in the examined datasets (Supplementary Table S2). Altogether, these data suggest that our OET lncRNA clusters form a high-quality collection of the most expressed maternal and zygotic lncRNAs.3.2. Structure and expression of OET lncRNAsOET lncRNA loci were stochastically distributed across the genome (Fig. 2A). The highest density of lncRNA loci was on chromosome 10 (0.98 lncRNA/Mb) while the lowest density on chromosome 17 (0.18 lncRNA/Mb), which contained just 17 lncRNAs (Fig. 2A). These densities significantly differed (Holm corrected t-test P-value < 10-6) from the mean lncRNA density across all chromosomes (0.61 lncRNA/Mb) while protein-coding gene density did not (Holm corrected t-test P-value > 0.05).

(I) Contribution of repetitive sequences to mature (spliced) OET lncRNA sequences.When compared with maternal mRNAs, loci encoding lncRNAs were shorter and produced shorter transcripts (Fig. 2B–D); this difference could be attributed to a higher number of exons in mRNAs. OET lncRNAs had markedly shorter 5' exons but lengths of internal and 3' exons of mRNAs and lncRNAs were much closer to each other (Fig. 2E). Shorter 5' exons also came from long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, which gave rise to ~third of 5' exons (Fig. 2G and H). The analysis of contribution of repetitive elements to lncRNA genes showed that SINE and LINE elements contributed to mature lncRNA sequences more often than to lncRNA promoters and transcription start sites. In contrast, LTR elements, especially the MaLR class, made a strong contribution to lncRNA promoters (Fig. 2G and H). A similar observation was also made by Veselovska et al.11The most-expressed 1,600 OET lncRNAs were more than an order of magnitude less expressed than the 1,600 most expressed OET mRNAs (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with low lncRNA expression reported elsewhere.19,25,28–30 It is possible that OET lncRNAs evolved to have lower expression than mRNAs. Lower lncRNA expression could stem from different requirements for functioning than those applied to mRNAs. Alternatively, lower lncRNA expression could reflect a minimal selective pressure on high expression levels of evolving lncRNAs lacking a function. At the same time, highest expressed mRNAs may represent a derived trait, which questions whether the comparison reflects properties of highly expressed mRNAs or an lncRNA feature. If there were no major difference in control of expression between lncRNAs and mRNAs, a random set of 1,600 mRNAs would have expression similar to OET lncRNAs. Thus, we compared expression of 1,600 OET lncRNAs with 1,000 random selections of 1,600 OET mRNAs. We observed that mRNAs generally retained higher expression than lncRNAs while levels of both types of RNAs were essentially the same within the least expressed quartile (Fig. 3A56). Whether the differences in expression levels between lncRNAs and mRNAs reflect lncRNA-specific features in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulations remains unclear. Given the arbitrary definition and functional heterogeneity of lncRNAs, it is difficult to envision some feature underlying lower lncRNA expression levels except for one: a lack of function. Expression of non-functional lncRNAs would not be maintained and would most likely decline over time due to mutations affecting transcriptional control elements.

Polyadenylation of OET lncRNAsBiogenesis of lncRNAs and mRNAs is common—they are spliced polymerase II transcripts whose transcription would utilize the same set of transcription factors. One of the features, by which lncRNAs could differ, is polyadenylation of the 3' end. Consequently, we examined whether a comparison of total RNA and polyA RNA FPKM values would be indicative of the polyadenylation status (polyA FPKM/total RNA FPKM, for simplicity referred as polyA score, Fig. 3B). GV oocytes and MII eggs are an excellent model system for testing this idea because of two possible internal controls: (i) Replication dependent histone mRNAs carrying at their 3' ends unique stem loop structures instead of polyA tails (reviewed in32). Presence of these transcripts within polyA-selected RNA would reflect the extent of contamination with non-polyadenylated mRNA. (ii) Dormant maternal mRNAs, translationally repressed mRNAs with short polyA tails stored in the GV oocyte, which are readenylated and translated during meiotic maturation (reviewed in33). Thus, we selected 20 highly expressed replication-dependent histone genes lacking alternative polyadenylated transcript isoforms and five dormant maternal mRNAs, for which the cytoplasmic polyadenylation during meiosis was demonstrated: Mos, Plat, Cyclin B1, Orc6l, and Dcp1a.34–38The distribution of the polyA score for lncRNAs from GV and MII stages yielded sigmoidal curves with slightly different slopes (Fig. 3B), which were reproduced with mRNA data (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Although the difference in slopes might reflect intrinsic differences of GV and MII transcriptomes, polyA scores accurately reflected the lack of polyadenylation of histone mRNAs and cytoplasmic polyadenylation of dormant maternal mRNAs during meiotic maturation (Fig. 3B and Supplementary S5A). The average polyA score of dormant maternal mRNAs, which was 1.106 in GV oocytes, increased to 7.895 in MII eggs. This difference also manifested as a shift of dormant mRNAs along the polyA score rank (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Taken together, the behavior of polyA scores appeared indicative of the polyA status. Based on this strategy, we estimated that only a minority of OET lncRNAs lacked the polyA tail. Since lncRNAs detectable in oocytes and/or two-cell zygotes (>1 FPKM) represented ~95% of the 1,600 lncRNAs, we added normalized polyA scores (median = 0 and variance = 1) from GV oocytes, MII eggs, one-, two-, and four-cell embryos to lncRNA annotation (Supplementary Table S2). However, given the diverse origin of total RNA and polyA RNA NGS data, polyA scores should be taken as an indication rather than an annotation of the polyadenylation status.The dynamics of polyA scores of dormant maternal mRNAs raised a question whether similar behavior could also be found among maternal lncRNAs. Remarkably, we identified 91 maternal lncRNAs with expression >1 FPKM whose polyA scores increased more than 5-fold during meiosis. Next, we analysed which of the 91 maternal lncRNAs carried putative cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs). CPEs mediate the recruitment of dormant deadenylated mRNAs for translation. A CPE is bound by a CPE-binding protein (CPEB), which recognizes a canonical consensus site 5'-UUUUUAU-3' art the 3' end of RNAs. However, CPE variations such as UUUUAU, UUUUUAAU, or UUUUAACA were also reported.39 We found that at least 14 lncRNAs carried a combination of a canonical AAUAAA signal site and a CPE-like motif at their 3' ends (Fig. 3C). lncRNAs resembling dormant maternal RNAs are remarkable because they suggest that cytoplasmic polyadenylation and dormancy could play a more general role in RNA regulation, i.e. a role that goes beyond translational control of maternal mRNAs. We hypothesize that controlled cytoplasmic polyadenylation during transcriptional quiescence could ‘activate’ stored maternal lncRNAs. Thus, putative dormant maternal lncRNAs represent excellent candidates for further functional studies of lncRNAs functioning between ovulation and ZGA.Importantly, major changes in cytoplasmic RNA polyadenylation during OET occur also post-fertilization.40,41 In fact, cytoplasmic RNA polyadenylation in fertilized mouse eggs is so extensive that it manifests as an increase in total polyA RNA content.27 A scatter plot of relative changes of lncRNAs in polyA and total RNA NGS sets in MII eggs and one-cell embryos showed a relative enrichment in lncRNA polyadenylation upon fertilization; this was similar to changes observed for mRNAs (Fig. 3D). In contrast to mRNAs, the number of lncRNAs showing a stronger decrease in polyA RNA upon fertilization was minimal. Increased polyadenylation did not seem to be an artifact of our samples, as it also showed when other published data were used (Supplementary Fig. S5B).Taken together, our data suggest that the bulk of OET lncRNAs are polyadenylated at their 3' end and that maternal lncRNAs utilize the same cytoplasmic polyadenylation mechanisms as mRNAs. In case of mRNAs, cytoplasmic polyadenylation regulates translation and RNA turnover. Although lncRNAs seem to be recognized by the translation machinery,42,43 their coding capacity is highly restricted. Therefore, the interaction of lncRNAs with cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation machinery likely regulates their functional availability and stability.3.4. Expression of OET lncRNAs in other tissuesSince the bulk of the 1,600 OET lncRNAs appeared polyadenylated, we examined their expression across 22 tissues selected from the ENCODE polyA RNA NGS mouse tissue panel (GSE4941744). To increase the specificity of expression analysis, we included only clusters with four or more spliced reads in the tissue panel and expression >4 FPKM in at least one of the tissues. The cut-off 4 FPKM for polyA RNA was used because it is an approximate of 1 FPKM in total RNA NGS from mouse oocytes, where mRNAs make 24% of all reads (Supplementary Fig. S1). Under these filtering conditions, we obtained expression values for 356 clusters (Fig. 4 andSupplementary Table S3). The analysis revealed a small population of ubiquitously expressed lncRNA clusters (28 having expression >4 FPKM in all tissues, Supplementary Table S3). This is consistent with the notion that mammalian lncRNAs typically have a cell type-restricted expression.29 Of the 28 lncRNA clusters ubiquitously expressed >4 FPKM, 26 were annotated; they were from small nucleolar RNA host genes and other lncRNAs, such as Malat, Firre, or Rian. Remarkably, OET lncRNAs were mostly expressed in the testis. Within the tissue panel (which also included the ovary and the placenta), the testis stood out as the tissue that had the highest number of maximum expressions of clusters across tissues (121 clusters, Supplementary Table S4). The testis also yielded the highest number of expressed clusters among the tissues (202 clusters). The ovary ranked second after the testis, having the maximum expression of 19 clusters, while the total number of ovary-expressed clusters was 110 (Supplementary Table S4).

The heatmap displays expression of 356 clusters with expression values >4 FPKM in at least one of 22 tissues selected from the ENCODE polyA RNA NGS mouse tissue panel (GSE49417 [37]).LncRNAs expressed in the testis and during OET represent an interesting group of germ-line lncRNAs. We took a closer look at the transcriptional control of the 121 lncRNA clusters expressed >4 FPKMs to determine (i) if they are associated with maternal or zygotic expression, and (ii) whether they share the same promoters in the testis and OET stages or whether they have testis-specific promoters not utilized during OET. Most of the 121 lncRNA clusters during OET were highly expressed maternally (93 clusters), while 25 clusters had the highest expression in the zygotic stage and three clusters in the embryonic stage. We examined the promoters of the 121 clusters and found that approximately half of them (58 of 121 examined promoters) controlled the expression in testes and OET stages. In 37 cases, a unique non-repetitive lncRNA promoter functioned in testes, while oocytes or early embryos employed a different unique promoter (19/37) or a retrotransposon-derived one, such as a maternally active MaLR class LTR promoter (12/37). In any case, the 93 lncRNA loci expressed in oocytes and testes are prime candidates for an analysis of lncRNAs with germline-specific functions.3.5. lncRNA dynamics during OETGene expression during OET can be divided into three basic classes reflecting the replacement of maternal RNAs with zygotic transcripts:(i) maternal—concerns genes active only in oocytes whose transcripts survive until different time-points/stages of OET. They are not replaced with zygotic/embryonic transcripts. These transcripts may be important just for oocyte development or they may function during meiotic maturation or after fertilization, where they might contribute to ZGA and to the initiation of development.(ii) zygotic—concerns genes expressed during ZGA and not active in the oocyte. Zygotic transcripts may be made just transiently during ZGA or they may remain expressed during early development. These are represented, for example, by transcripts of genes involved in the establishment and maintenance of totipotency.(iii) maternal-zygotic—concerns genes expressed in both oocytes and early embryos. This category can be exemplified by housekeeping genes. Within this category, maternal gene expression may be much higher than that observed in early embryos or vice versa.To characterize lncRNA dynamics during OET, we divided lncRNA clusters into the three classes of gene expression described earlier. First, we reduced the complexity of the model system by stage grouping (as it was used for transcript model assembly) into three basic expression states: maternal (M), zygotic (Z), and embryonic (E). The M level was calculated as an average lncRNA level in GV and MII oocytes; it represented lncRNA expression before fertilization. The Z level was calculated as an average lncRNA level in two- and four-cell stages; it represented the transitive period of gene expression during ZGA. The E level was calculated as an average lncRNA level in morulae and blastocysts; it represented gene expression at a later embryonic stage during which maternal RNAs were cleared up (and so was ZGA-specific expression) and replaced by zygotic/embryonic transcripts. Next, we adjusted M, Z, and E lncRNA values so that the highest value was set to one, and we displayed values for all lncRNA clusters in a single plot (Fig. 5A). Figure 5Open in new tabDownload slideOET lncRNA population dynamics during early development. (A) Overview of expression patterns of OET lncRNAs.

In (F), lncRNAs are labeled by gene names from which the pseudogene sequences in lncRNAs originated.LncRNA expression patterns during OET were classified into six groups matching the maternal, zygotic, and maternal-zygotic expression types (Fig. 5B). First, we used the highest expression states to define M, Z, and E groups. Then, we defined maternal lncRNA clusters in the M group as those with a minimal E level (E values <5% of M values), while the remaining lncRNA clusters in the M group were considered maternal-zygotic lncRNA clusters. Analogically, we defined zygotic lncRNA clusters in the Z and E groups as those with a minimal M level (M values <5% of Z or E values), while the remaining lncRNA clusters in the Z and E groups were considered maternal-zygotic lncRNAs. The distribution of maximum values in M, Z, E correlated with the number of clusters defined from maternal, ZGA and embryonic sets (Fig. 1D).To obtain a comprehensive view of temporal dynamics of OET lncRNAs, we organized all lncRNAs clusters into a heatmap based on six basic patterns while displaying expression in all sequenced stages (Fig.5C). Most clusters (1,166, displayed on the left) reached a maximum in M. The majority of those declined rapidly during ZGA, reaching low levels in the blastocyst. Of the 1,166 lncRNA cluster with the maximum in M, 993 transcripts exhibited the E value <5% of M. These represent candidates for class I—maternal lncRNA clusters. This class is clearly the most abundant one in our dataset. In total 393 and 131 lncRNA clusters had maximum values in Z and E, respectively; 251 of those had minimal maternal expression (M values <5% of Z values), thus representing class II—zygotic lncRNA clusters (Fig. 5C). Of these, 107 lncRNAs were only transiently expressed during ZGA. 446 lncRNA clusters were considered class III—maternal-zygotic transcripts. Maternal-zygotic lncRNAs could be divided into two categories: (i) those constantly present during OET, i.e. zygotic transcripts appearing before maternal ones were eliminated, and (ii) those whose maternal transcripts were strongly reduced before zygotic/embryonic transcripts emerged—there was a distinct minor group of 59 maternal-zygotic clusters whose expression reached the minimum at the two- and four-cell stages (Z value >0.05 FPKM). The dynamics of lncRNA expression differed from mRNAs (Fig. 5C bottom) mainly in the proportion of maternal and maternal-zygotic expression. Although 62% of the 1,600 OET lncRNA loci were maternal (class I), maternally expressed mRNAs made 20% of all OET mRNAs. Furthermore, maternal-zygotic lncRNAs were a minor fraction of OET lncRNAs (28%), while this class was highly abundant (68%) among mRNAs, which was not surprising considering the multitudes of housekeeping roles of encoded proteins (Fig. 5C).Interesting results emerged from an analysis of RNA expression correlations between individual stages (Fig. 5D). We compared expression of lncRNAs and mRNA exons and introns (introns-derived reads reveal the presence of nascent transcripts, i.e. of ongoing transcription12). Remarkably, lncRNAs showed positive correlations among stages with a strong contribution of maternal RNA (GV oocyte and unfertilized/fertilized eggs) and among zygotic stages (two-, four-cell, morula, and blastocyst), but not between any two stages from the two groups. Although two-cell stage lncRNAs showed no correlation with preceding stages, the later stages even had negative correlations (Fig. 5D). This apparently reflected the extensive mutually exclusive nature of maternal and zygotic lncRNA transcriptions, which was also apparent from the expression heatmap (Fig. 5C).In contrast, an analysis of exons of protein coding revealed good correlations between any two of the analysed stages (Fig. 5D). This was apparently due to abundant maternal-zygotic expression of protein-coding genes (68% of mRNA transcriptome in Fig. 5C). The maternal-to-zygotic transcriptome transition manifested as higher correlations among stages containing high levels of maternal transcripts (GV oocytes, unfertilized eggs, and fertilized eggs) and among stages expressing zygotic transcripts (two-cell and later). An intron-based analysis showed similar correlations within maternal and zygotic groups but their borderline was shifted to an earlier developmental stage (fertilized egg/one-cell stage), apparently reflecting the minimal amount of intron-derived reads in the maternal transcriptome and the effects of minor ZGA, which took place during the one-cell stage.12Our results are consistent with a previous observation that lncRNA expression varies at different stages of cleavage stage embryos, suggesting cleavage stage-specific expression.9 Our results show two main expression patterns—maternal expression, which does not come back during early development, and zygotic expression dominated by a transient major ZGA expression pattern. This implies that expression of the bulk of OET lncRNA clusters is driven by oocyte- and ZGA-specific transcription factors, because ubiquitous transcription factors would control only a minority of OET lncRNA clusters. This is consistent with stereotypical observations of high numbers of cell-type-specific lncRNAs.29 But why would lncRNAs adapt their expression for tissue or stage-specific transcription factors? We speculate that lncRNAs emerge from random transcription of genic and intergenic regions and that this random expression by ubiquitous transcription factors is under stronger selective pressure than expression restricted to a specific cell type/developmental stage.3.6. Inferring biological roles of OET lncRNAs from NGS dataThe role of most of the 1,600 OET lncRNAs is unknown and it is possible that the majority of them have no function. However, several suggestive observations emerged while annotating OET lncRNA. For example, we found two novel maternally expressed lncRNA clusters located in imprinted loci, whose expressions correlate with the maternal pattern of expression. lncRNA-OET-17-106 overlaps antisense with 3' end of Airn lncRNA, which is maternally silenced (Supplementary Fig. S6A); lncRNA-OET-12-253 is expressed just downstream of an imprinted miRNA cluster, which is expressed from the maternal allele (Supplementary Fig. S6A). We also found interesting expression patterns in several known lncRNA loci, such as Malat1, Neat1, or Cyrano (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1, reviewed in45) is among the most studied lncRNA after Xist. Malat1 is a conserved extremely abundant lncRNA non-essential for normal development.46–48,Malat1 transcript levels are minimal in the oocyte relative to later preimplantation stages (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Similarly, expression of Neat1, lncRNA encoded adjacent to Malat1, starts at ZGA and a shorter Neat1 transcript isoform accumulates from the four-cell stage on (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Thus, the Malat1/Neat1 locus transcription is a zygotic component of OET. In contrast, Cyrano lncRNA, which has been implicated in embryonic development in zebrafish,30 exhibits relatively rare maternal and zygotic expression pattern while zygotic expression in the locus extents into a conserved the 3' end region (Supplementary Fig. S6B).Among the lncRNA types, which can be identified, are precursors for small RNAs in RNA silencing pathways, since they can be matched with small RNAs cloned from mouse oocytes and early embryos.23,49–51 We detected the primary miRNA precursor (pri-miRNA) carrying the miR-290-295 miRNA cluster (lncRNA-OET-07-048) whose expression starts at the two-cell stage and is present during early development (Fig. 5E). The miR-290-295 family is associated with pluripotency and is closely related to the miR-430 family, which functions in zebrafish embryos (reviewed in52). The miR-290-295 family most likely does not contribute strongly to maternal mRNA clearance since most maternal mRNAs become eliminated before the miR-290-295 miRNAs accumulate enough to have an impact on the cellular transcriptome. At the same time, we did not detect any pri-miRNAs of the let-7 family, the most abundant miRNA family expressed in mouse oocytes.53 This might be explained by the fact that the analysed fully grown oocytes were transcriptionally already quiescent, thus it would be possible that let-7 precursors were already processed into miRNAs. Consequently, we would not observe precursor sequences in oocyte NGS data similarly to the absence of nascent transcripts of maternally expressed genes.12Although a miRNA precursor yields miRNA(s) with defined sequence(s), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which guide endonucleolytic cleavage of cognate RNAs in the RNA interference (RNAi), are produced from a precursor as a population of 21–23 nt RNAs. Mouse oocytes are unique among mammalian cells since they produce high amounts of endogenous siRNAs from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).23,54 Endogenous dsRNA can form through (i) a transcription of an inverted repeat, (ii) a convergent transcription, and (iii) basepairing of mRNA and antisense RNA originating, e.g. from a processed pseudogene. Interestingly, of the 13 genes, for which Tam et al. predicted basepiring with transcripts from processed pseudogenes, 7 were annotated among the OET lncRNAs. All of them were maternally expressed (Fig. 5F). Antisense sequences of processed pseudogenes can be found in lncRNAs expressed elsewhere, but efficient siRNA production in mice requires a unique maternal isoform of the Dicer enzyme.14,55 Therefore, lncRNAs carrying antisense sequences of processed pseudogenes have unique functionality restricted to oocytes and early embryos, where they can be efficiently converted to endo-siRNAs.Remarkably, two of these lncRNAs matched the predicted dormant lncRNAs shown in Figure 3C (lncRNA-OET-08-341 complementary to Ppp4r1 mRNA and lncRNA-OET-02-259 complementary to Traip mRNA). We hypothesize that cytoplasmic polyadenylation could regulate the availability of the siRNA substrate and thus control the pace of clearance of specific maternal mRNAs.3.7. Functional analysis of two OET lncRNAsFor a functional analysis, we chose two maternal lncRNAs (lncRNA-OET-19-199 and lncRNA-OET-06-154, Fig. 6A and B), which had good expression, used a dominant promoter, showed sequence conservation among mammals, and were syntenic relative to adjacent genes. Both lncRNAs were maternally expressed and degraded after fertilization (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). Upon confirming lncRNA expression patterns by qPCR (Fig. 6C and E), we created mouse knockout models using RNA-guided CRISPR Cas9 system.15,16 We aimed at deleting the promoter and exon1 (Supplementary Figs. S7D and S8C) in order to suppress lncRNA transcription in the locus, not just the accumulation of mature lncRNA. We successfully produced lncRNA knockouts and confirmed the loss of lncRNA expression by a qPCR analysis (Fig. 6D and F). Figure 6Open in new tabDownload slideCRISPR-mediated lncRNA knockouts of.

S7E and S8D). The basis of this effect is currently under investigation. Nonetheless, homozygous null females for each lncRNA knockout were fertile and breeding of null animals produced viable offspring in both cases. Ovarian histology of knockout animals appeared normal and normal amounts of fully grown oocytes were recovered from null females (data not shown). We also examined expression of nearest genes (Fig. 6D and F). We observed a significant difference in one of the neighbouring genes of lncRNA-OET-19-199 (Fig. 6D). However, whether this reflected the biological role of lncRNA-OET-19-199 or whether it was a consequence of the introduced DNA deletion remains unknown.Importantly, we assigned a biological function to one of the transcript isoforms of lncRNA-OET-06-154, even though the loss expression of lncRNA-OET-06-154 had no effect on fertility (Supplementary Fig. S8D) and there was no effect on neighbouring genes (Fig. 6F). The reason was that the most downstream terminal exon of lncRNA-OET-06-154 carried an antisense sequences from the Eef1g pseudogene (Fig. 6G). The pseudogene insertion happened already in the common ancestor of mice and rats, and the pseudogene fragment was subsequently disrupted by several LTR insertions in the mouse lineage. The antisense pseudogene sequence generates an endo-siRNAs as evidenced by mapping small RNAs from NGS data23 to the locus (Fig. 6G). Small RNAs targeting Eef1g are biologically active as evidenced by Eef1g upregulation in both Dicer and Ago2 knockout oocytes (Fig. 6H). Taken together, lncRNA-OET-06-154 represents an example of a locus expressing multiple transcript isoforms that might differ in function: those carrying the most downstream 3’ terminal exon would be engaged in RNAi-mediated repression of Eef1g in the oocyte, while others might have another function (or no function at all). This lncRNA example also shows that functional siRNAs may have originated from a pseudogene insertion more than 40 million years old as suggested by molecular dating of the common ancestor of mice and rats based on 658 nuclear genes.56We thank Radek Malik, Radek Jankele, Martin Moravec, Helena Fulkova, Josef Pasulka, and other members of our laboratories for discussions and assistance, the Mediterranean Institute for Life Sciences for hosting the data mining sessions, and the Transgenic and Archiving Module of the Czech Centre for Phenogenomics, Institute of Molecular Genetics ASCR whose work was supported by LM2011032 and LM2015040 (MEYS) and the BIOCEV European Regional Development Fund CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0109.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe main support for this research was provided through a Marie Curie Initial Training Network (project no. 607720, RNATRAIN) funding for S.G.

IntroductionTissue differentiation is an obligatory phenomenon in higher organisms. There exists a cohort of cellular and molecular mechanisms to fulfil this requisite of biological system. The proteome complement of a cell type defines its differentiation/transformation status (e.g. normal vs malignant status) and functionality. However, the proteome profile is primarily determined by the transcriptomic complement of a cell that is governed by the nucleus.1,2 The coordinated modulation and dynamical expression of a complement of transcription factors (TF) direct lineage-specific developments of each cell type.3 Such spatio-temporal regulation of differential gene expression occurs due to interaction of trans acting factors (along with their interacting partners) with genomic components, mainly promoters and enhancers.4 These are guided by the nuclear proteome of each cell dictated by the extracellular and intracellular signals and cumulatively govern transcriptional activity of chromatin carried out in the nucleus.We chose testicular Sertoli cells (Sc) to visualize dynamical gene/proteome regulation upon maturation because this cell undergoes maturation after birth. Infant Sc from 5-day-old rats are immature and incapable to support germ cell (Gc) development, whereas by 12 days of age, Sc are well differentiated and regulate Gc development successfully leading to robust onset of the process of spermatogenesis.5 Although levels of circulating FSH and testosterone (T), which regulate spermatogenesis via Sc, are similar in infant (5 days) and pubertal (12 days) rats,6–8 robust Gc differentiation is noticed only in 12-day-old testis. This suggests that there are endogenous cellular switches or mechanisms leading to maturation of Sc during puberty, which are missing during infancy. Use of modern analysis tools to explore the transcriptomic and proteomic complement of such maturation of cells, associated with its phenotype, may help us in resolving unexplained mechanisms identified in such cellular transitions.Recent technological advancements provide new powerful tools to compare comprehensive transcriptome or proteome profiles obtained from multiple biological samples. Significantly large amounts of information, including new regulatory pathways and hub molecules, have been identified using high-throughput omics-based data.9,10We report the key TF binding sites (TFBS) and associated nuclear proteins present in infant and pubertal Sc of rats. For this, genome-wide computational analysis of the promoters was performed. Promoters of differentially expressed transcripts were determined using data from microarray analysis of infant and pubertal Sc. TFBS prediction of the promoters was done using TRANSFAC database. Since activity of these TFBS is governed by nuclear proteome of the cell type, quantitative nuclear proteome profiling was performed. Since activity and functions of a protein can depend exclusively on post-translational modifications (PTMs), discovery proteomics approach was performed to identify PTMs in the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteome of these two age groups of Sc. Comprehensive quantitative analyses of proteome in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of Sc were performed using data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics (SWATH-MS) analysis.11,12We established the role of YY1, a lead candidate obtained in this study, in Sc differentiation using a transgenic knockdown model of rat. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cataloguing the potential TFBS that are active and required for onset of differentiation, post birth. Such biological validation of omics-based output generated substantial support for undertaking such multi-omics approach-based studies. This is the first report of comprehensive proteome quantification (using SWATH-MS) in mammalian system at organelle level.2. Materials and methods2.1. Promoter sequence retrieval and TF binding analysisThe ±2-kb promoter sequences centred at annotated transcription start site (TSS) for all differentially expressed (up and down) and control-set gene (un-expressed genes of same cardinality) promoters were retrieved from UCSC-Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/). All these promoter sequences [differentially expressed (up and down] and control-set gene promoter sequences) were analysed for the presence of different TFBSs using MATCH™ program available with TRANSFAC® professional 12.1. The total occurrence of individual TFBS on each differentially expressed gene-set promoter was considered as observed frequency. Similarly, the total occurrence of an individual TFBS from control-set promoters divided by total promoters in control-set gave the expected frequency of individual TFBS (Fig. 1A). The discrepancy between the observed frequency and expected frequency for individual TFBS on differentially expressed (up and down) gene-set promoters was evaluated by determining the statistically variable chi-square (<U+03C7>2). All significantly enriched TFBS (P < 0.05) from both up-regulated and down-regulated gene-set promoters were further interrogated for positional binding distribution analysis (with respect to TSS).

TFBS interactome analysisInteractome analysis was performed using STRING database in order to determine the proteins associated with a set of TFBS. A set of TFBS was queried against the STRING database to extract all their interacting genes and proteins. Only high confidence (score > 0.7) hits were allowed to appear with no >50 interacting partners.2.3. Sertoli cell cultureRattus norvegicus (Wistar rats) for this study was procured from the small animal facility of National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. Animals were maintained and bred in accordance to the guidelines provided by CPCSEA, Government of India. All the experiments involving animals in this study were approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committee.Infant and Pubertal rat Sc were isolated and cultured as described previously by us.5 Briefly, testes were surgically removed from the animal and were decapsulated. Hanks Balanced Salt Solution was used for all the tissue processing of the testis. The decapsulated testis was then chopped and enzymatically digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged down to eliminate Leydig cells and other interstitial cells. Pancreatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for digestion to disrupt the seminiferous tubules and separate the SC clusters (groups of SC with attached germ cells) from the peritubular cells and germ cells upon centrifugation. These Sc clusters were then plated with DMEM-F12 medium with 1% serum foetal bovine serum (FBS). The serum media was then replaced by 1% growth factor DMEM-F12 media. Germ cells were removed by hypotonic shock 48 hours after plating. Pulsatile hormone treatment of FSH and T was given 72 hours post plating as described previously.5 The cells were harvested for further processing to obtain protein.2.4. Sample preparation for mass spectrometryNuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions were isolated from cultured Sc using NE-PERTM (Thermo Scientific, USA) Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein fractions were diluted in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The diluted samples were then reduced with 25 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) at 60°C for 30 min followed by alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were then incubated with porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega V111) for overnight at 37°C in 1:10 ratio (trypsin to protein). The trypsin-digested samples were dried up using speed vac. The peptides obtained were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid solution for mass spectrometry analysis.2.5. Nano LC–MS/MS analysisChromatographic separation was performed on a NanoLC system (NanoLC-2D Ultra, Eksigent). Peptides were trapped on a NanoLC pre-column (ChromXP C18-CL-3 µm, I.D. 0.35 × 0.5 mm Eksigent) and then eluted onto an analytical column (C18-CL-120, I.D. 0.075 × 150 mm, Eksigent). A 1,000-ng sample was loaded, trapped and desalted at 3 µl/min for 37 min with 100% mobile phase A [2% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich)]. Peptides were separated at a flowrate of 250 nl/min using a stepwise gradient of buffer B [98% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich)] from 5% to 10% B in the first 10 min and from 10% to 40% in the following 60 min, from 40% to 50% in the next 10 min. The column was washed after the gradient with 90% B for 10 min before re-equilibrating to the initial chromatographic conditions for 10 min.2.6. Mass spectrometric analysisData acquisition was performed with a TripleTOF 5600 System (SCIEX, Concord, ON, CA) fitted with a Nanospray III source (SCIEX, Concord, ON, CA) and a pulled quartz tip as the emitter (New Objectives, Woburn, MA). The electrospray source was operated with ion spray voltage of 2.2 kV, a curtain gas of 25 PSI, a nebulizer gas of 20 PSI, and an interface heater temperature of 125 °C. The MS was operated with a resolution greater than or equal to 30,000 full width at half maximum for TOF MS scans with mass range 350–1250 m/z. For shotgun proteomics, information-dependent acquisition (IDA) experiment, survey scans were acquired in 250 Mrs. Product ion scans with mass range 200–1800 m/z were collected in high-sensitivity mode for the 20 most intense precursor with an intensity higher than 150 counts per second and with a charge-state between 2+ and 5+. The cycle time was kept constant at 1.7 s. Four time bins were summed for each scan at a pulser frequency value of 11 kHz through monitoring of the 40 GHz multichannel TDC detector with four-anode/channel detection. Rolling collision energy (CE) with the default equations and a spread of 5 V was used for collision-induced dissociation. Selected precursors were excluded for 5 seconds after one occurrence.2.7. SWATH-MS analysisFor data-independent acquisition, a SWATH-MS acquisition method was generated using the ‘create SWATH’ mode. The mass range from 350 to 1250 Da was covered with 36 selection windows with an isolation width of 26 Da (25 Da of optimal ion transmission efficiency 1 Da for the window overlap).11 The CE for each window was determined using the same equation as for the IDA experiments based on the 2+ charge precursor with a spread of 5 eV. The total duty cycle was of 3.0 seconds (total 2.95 seconds for stepping through the 36 isolation windows - 0.05 seconds for the optional survey scan). The MS/MS acquisition was performed in high-sensitivity mode corresponding to the mass resolution of about 15,000, which also enables to extract fragment ions with 10–50 ppm accuracy.2.8. SWATH-assay library generationThe Trans-Proteomic Pipeline was used for data analysis.13,14 All the .wiff files obtained in IDA experiments were converted to .mzML format using msconvert from ProteoWizard version 3.0.4624 selecting vendor-specific peak picking algorithm.15 All the .mzML files were then independently searched against rat protein sequence file using X!Tandem16 and Comet17 search. The rat protein sequence contained all the sequence available in UniProt database (February 2015) supplemented with the common laboratory contaminant proteins and decoy sequences generated by randomizing the rat protein sequences using TPP v4.8.0 PHILAE, Build 201412031424-6764 (Linux). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021464) was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine and acetylation of lysine (+14.0165, +28.0313) was considered as variable modifications. A maximum of two missed cleavage was allowed. Precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance were set to 75 and 30 ppm, respectively. The .pep.xml files obtained from each search were statistically evaluated using PeptideProphet followed by combining the results using iProphet.A consensus spectral library was built using SpectraST based on the peptide spectrum matches with a P > 0.65, which corresponds to a decoy estimated error rate of 0.41% on peptide level and SWATH-MS assays were generated from this spectral library essentially as reported previously.18 In short, we selected precursor ions in the mass range of 400–1,250 Da, with at least 4 and at the most 100 fragment ions with a charge state between 1+ and 4+ that fall in the mass range of 350–2,000, but excluding the precursor mass window.To normalize the retention time of the peptide, the retention time of the peptides of all the runs were adjusted to the run with maximum number of identifications by linear regression. The normalized retention time of each peptide was then determined, by taking the median of all the retention time determined for the individual runs. Finally, the rat SWATH-assay library was updated with the normalized retention times.2.9. SWATH-MS quantitationThe SWATH-MS files were interrogated with SWATH-assay library (Fig. 1B) using MS/MSALL with SWATH-MS Acquisition MicroApp version 2.0 and PeakView version 2.2 software (SCIEX, Concord, ON, CA). Maximum six peptides were allowed for quantification of a single protein with a maximum of six transitions per peptide. The transition was extracted in a retention time window of 5 min (±2.5 min) and with a mass tolerance of 75 ppm. Peptides with a minimum confidence level of 95% were used. False discovery rate (FDR) threshold was kept below 5%. The filtered proteins and associated peptides were exported to MarkerView version 1.2.1 software (Sciex, Concord, ON, CA) for relative quantitative analysis. The median peak ratio method was used for the normalization of the quantitative protein data for all samples of different groups. Statistical analysis of the relative quantitation was performed by t-test analysis. The protein levels with a P < 0.05 were considered significant. For all SWATH-MS quantitation in this study, three biological replicates were used. For each biological replicate, there were three technical replicates.2.10. Gene ontology analysisGene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using GORILLA (Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis and Visualization Tool).19 The proteins found to be in high abundance in nuclear or cytoplasm (fold change >2, P < 0.05) using SWATH-MS analysis were considered for performing GO analysis.2.11. PTM analysisPTM search was performed using ProteinPilot software 5.0 (Sciex, USA) employing Paragon Algorithm.20 All the three IDA files obtained from the different biological replicates of each sample were processed together. UniProt database in FASTA format was used as sequence library of Rattus norvegicus. All biological and invivo modifications available with ProteinPilot were checked with global FDR <1%.2.12. Plasmid constructs designThe hairpin (TCAAGAG) and seed sequence of Yy1 (CGACGGTTGTAATAAGAAGTTTGCTCAGT)- and Luciferase (GGATTTCAGTCGATGTACACGTTCGTCAC)-specific shRNA were obtained from OriGene (USA). The forward and reverse DNA strand of shRNA was procured from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The sequence of both the strands was designed such that upon annealing it generates a staggered ends compatible for ligation into EcoRI (5') and SalI (3') digested vector. shRNA strands were annealed in NEB buffer-2 using thermal cycler with initial incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. This mixture was then incubated at every temperature at the interval of 2 °C for 1 second till it reached 85 °C. The temperature of the mixture was thereafter decreased by interval of 0.1 °C every cycle with incubation time of 1 second at every temperature till it reaches 25 °C followed by quick chill down to 4 °C. The shRNA annealing was confirmed in a 4% agarose gel. The annealed oligo was then ligated in the vector digested with EcoRI and SalI. Positive colonies were screened by digesting the plasmid with AgeI (the restriction enzyme site for AgeI was added after the shRNA seed sequence and is absent in the vector backbone).2.13. Generation of transgenic ratTransgenic rats with Sc-specific knockdown were generated using the method of testicular electroporation as described previously by us.21 Briefly, the maxi preparation of the YY1 knockdown plasmid (GenEluteTM HP Plasmid Maxiprep Kit; Sigma Aldrich) was linearized using the restriction enzyme Stu1 followed by ethanol precipitation. The linearized DNA was then injected into the testes of 38-day-old Wistar rats to generate a fore-founder animal. This fore-founder was then co-habitated with wild-type female rat 60 days after electroporation. The pups born were screened for the presence of transgene using slot blot analysis.2.14. Genomic DNA isolation and slot blot analysisGenomic DNA was isolated from the tail snip of the pups using phenol:chloroform isolation method.22 The isolated genomic DNA was quantitated using Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). For slot blot analysis, 2 µg of g-DNA was blotted onto positively charged nylon-66 membrane (M\DI Membrane Technologies, Ambala Cantt, India) and probed with a-P32-labelled DNA probe specific to the YY1 knockdown construct. The membrane was then analysed using phosphorimager Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare) to detect the transgene positive genomic DNA samples (Supplementary Figure S2).2.15. RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysisWhole testicular RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma Aldrich) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. All the real-time PCR analysis was done as previously described by us.23 Extracted RNA was quantified using NANO drop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). One microgram of RNA was subjected to DNase treatment followed by single-strand c-DNA synthesis using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, USA) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The c-DNA was then used for real-time PCR analysis using Mesa- green master mix kit (Eurogentech, Belgium) in StepOnePlus Real Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, USA). Gene expression was normalized using cyclophilin as a reference and expression value calculated as 2-<U+0394><U+0394>ct. Real-time PCR primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S12).2.16. RNA sequencing analysisThe quality of the RNA was assessed using Bioanalyzer followed by library preparation. These samples were then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with 2×100 Paired End cycles. RNA Seq reads were aligned/mapped to the rat reference genome (UCSC rn4) using TopHat2 (version 2.0.9).24 Expression quantification in terms of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads for each of the transcripts were determined using Cufflinks (version 2.2.1)25 and differentially expressed genes at P < 0.05 were identified using Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1).26 RNA sequencing experiments were performed in duplicates (biological replicates).2.17. Protein extraction and immunoblot analysisTotal testicular protein was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, USA) with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (AMRESCO, USA). Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, USA). The primary antibodies used were anti-YY1 alpha (Abcam, Cat. No. ab12132), anti-ß-actin (Cell Signalling Technologies, Cat. No.4967L). Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated (Epitomics, Cat. No.3053-1). Luminol and hydrogen peroxide were used as the substrate of HRP for developing the blot.2.18. Histological analysisBriefly, the rat testes were surgically removed and fixed in 4% paraformalydehyde followed by paraffin block preparation. Tissue sectioning were done using microtome machine (2040AUTOCUT, Reichert- Jung), followed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The testes sections were observed under bright field microscope (Eclipse TiNikon).The tubule diameters were measured in testis of rats by randomly selecting 10 tubules in each section of testis from three rats. Mean diameter of 10 tubules were used to determine average value.2.19. ImmunostainingSc were cultured and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized using 0.1% triton X-100 for 2 min followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 30 min. Primary antibody (Abcam, Cat. no. ab12132) was used at a dilution of 1:100 (overnight incubation, 4 °C). Secondary antibody alexafluor 488- goat anti-rabbit (Life Technologies, Cat. no. A-11008) was used at a dilution of 1:500 (45 min incubation, RT), Nuclei were stained using Hoechst 3342. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using prolong gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Cell imaging was done using Ri-2 Epi-flourescence microscope (Eclipse TiNikon).Testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by paraffin block preparation and tissue sectioning as described above (Histological analysis). The tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.5% triton X-100 for 20 min followed by blocking with 2% normal goat serum for 30 min. Primary antibody (Abcam, Cat. no. ab12132) was used at a dilution of 1:100 (overnight incubation, 4 °C). Secondary antibody alexafluor 488-goat anti-rabbit (Life Technologies, Cat. no. A-11008) was used at a dilution of 1:500 (4-h incubation, RT), Nuclei were stained using Hoechst 3342. Coverslips were mounted over the tissue sections using prolong gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Tissue imaging was performed using Ri-2 Epi-flourescence microscope (Eclipse Ti Nikon).2.20. Sperm count analysisThe caput epididymis was surgically removed and minced in 5-ml PBS solution in a petriplate. Ten microliters of the solution containing sperm was loaded into a Neubauer Haemocytometer, and the spermatozoa were counted to determine the sperm count for each animal.3. Results and discussion3.1. Unique sets of TFBS govern gene expression programme in infant and pubertal ScGenes expressed during puberty allow onset of spermatogenesis, which is restricted during infancy in majority of species.5,8 In order to define TF-mediated differential gene regulation in infant and pubertal Sc, we used gene expression data (DNA microarray) from NCBI-GEO (GSE48795) previously submitted by our lab. We identified 735 genes predominantly down-regulated and 663 genes predominantly up-regulated (P <0.05 and fold change >2) in pubertal Sc as compared to infant Sc (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S1). Next, we asked which TFBSs were predominant within the promoters of these differentially expressed genes. In order to address this, we searched for 220 TFBS (vertebrate non-redundant Positional Weight Matrices from TRANSFAC database) within ±2-kb promoter sequences of 735 up-regulated, 663 down-regulated and their respective control set promoters (see Material and methods) using the MATCH™ utility.27 The discrepancy between the frequency of individual TFBS on up and down-regulated gene-set promoters (observed occurrence) and that of control sets (expected by chance) was evaluated independently (Fig. 1A) by determining the statistical variable chi-square (<U+03C7>2).28 Considering a significance level of P < 0.05, we identified 61 TFBSs on up-regulated and 56 TFBSs on down-regulated gene-set promoters (Supplementary Table S2). Out of these, 19 and 14 TFBSs were found exclusive on up-regulated and down-regulated gene-set promoters, respectively (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we observed that binding sites for NF-AT1, C-Myb, ER-alpha, SP-100, YY1 and HIF-1alpha were uniquely enriched on up-regulated gene promoters (Figs 2C and 3C and Supplementary Table S5) while C-EBP alpha, GR, LEF-1, MAFA, RFX1 and Smad4 were uniquely enriched on down-regulated gene promoters (Figs 2C and 3C and Supplementary Table S5). The binding enrichment of each TFBS on individual gene promoters (both up and down) has been represented by a heat map (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, clustering analysis suggested groups of genes with exclusively high binding enrichment corresponding to a particular TFBS (Fig. 3A).

See Supplementary Tables S3–S5.Higher occurrence of 3 of the 19 TFBS, namely, GATA box, SF-1 and ER- alpha, in the promoter region of upregulated genes of pubertal Sc was found compared to infant Sc. Significance of TFs corresponding to these three TFBS have been shown previously in the testis displaying active spermatogenesis,29–32 strengthening the legitimacy of our TFBS analysis. Interestingly, the circadian rhythm-related TFBS, namely, E-box, ROR alpha and Rev-Erba alpha, were abundantly present in up-promoter-set. Association of Sc maturation with photoperiod has already been reported before.33–353.2. Pattern of TFBS distribution along TSSWe analysed the positional distribution of each TFBS with reference to annotated TSS of up- and down-regulated gene-set promoters. We observed that in case of down-regulated gene sets, majority of TFBS, namely, CEBP-alpha, COE1, GR, Kaiso, Lef-1, MAFA, RFX1, Smad4, were uniformly distributed across ± 2-kb region flanking TSS (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S4). However, in the case of up-regulated gene sets, the majority of TFBS, namely, AP-1, Arid5a, LXR, MECP2, Rev-ErbA alpha, ROR alpha, RP58, SF-1, SP100 and ZBRK1, had specific positional location across the ± 2-kb region centred to TSS, unlike uniform distribution observed in the case of down-regulated gene sets (Fig. 3B). This observation is in agreement with the previous report that suggests that TFBS associated with development are uniformly distributed across the TSS.36 The positional abundance of a particular TFBS with respect to TSS was calculated in terms of its cumulative abundance in all the genes of its corresponding gene set (up and down-gene-set).In pubertal Sc, restricted positional abundance was observed for many TFBSs. This is in agreement with a previous report suggesting that for tissue-specific expression of genes (potentially regulating cellular status of differentiation), there is a relation between positional binding of TF with reference to TSS.37,38 We found that promoters of up-regulated-gene-set of pubertal Sc, a terminally differentiated cell, show strict positional restriction in the occurrence of TFBS with reference to TSS (Fig. 3B). Heat map analysis revealed positional abundance of many of the TFBS suggesting their symmetrical presence on both sides of TSS, in promoters of up-regulated genes of pubertal Sc. Although there is no experimental evidence in support of this observation, close proximity binding of some Zinc finger protein flanking TSS (± 200 bases) has been previously reported using TRANSFAC.283.3. Quantitative proteomics of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in infant and pubertal ScThe transcriptional activity of TFBS is governed by the nuclear proteome profile. TF(s) that are found in cytoplasm but not in the nucleus may not participate in gene expression. Interactome analysis using String database39 analysis suggested 75 genes to be associated with the TFBS in case of downregulated-gene-set and 87 genes in case of upregulated-gene-set (using only high confidence hits, score > 0.7) of pubertal Sc as compared to infant Sc (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary Table S6). We applied state-of-the-art SWATH-MS analysis to quantitatively profile the proteome of the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fraction of infant and pubertal Sc. To enable the targeted extraction of peptide assays from SWATH-MS data, we generated a SWATH-assay library from biological triplicates of each fraction and time point used in this study and combined all assays into one comprehensive library (see Materials and methods for details).The final SWATH assay library consists of 21,163 assays (an assay is a set of all the fragment ions corresponding to a specific peptide ion) for 19,776 peptides mapping to 4,532 proteins (Fig. 1B).

Upon comparing the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome of 5-day-old Sc, 3,164 proteins were quantified (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Tables S7 and S8), of which 1,670 proteins were differentially present in nucleus and cytoplasm fractions (P < 0.05). In case of 12-day-old Sc, 3,769 proteins could be quantified (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Tables S7 and S8) out of which 890 proteins were found to be differentially present in nucleus and cytoplasm fractions (P < 0.05). In the nuclear proteome fraction of infant and pubertal Sc, 3,027 proteins could be quantified (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Tables S7 and S8), out of which 612 were found to be differentially (P < 0.05) localized in their nuclei. GO analysis was done for the nuclear (nuclear/cytoplasmic, fold change > 2, P < 0.05) and cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic/nuclear, fold change > 2, P < 0.05) proteins in both cases (infant and pubertal Sc). Our GO analysis showed high enrichment of chromatin and other DNA-binding proteins in nuclear fraction and structural proteins associated with cytoskeleton were found in cytoplasmic fraction as expected. This indicates a successful nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation of Sc (Supplementary Figure S1).

See Supplementary Table S7.Merging the IDA data of all the samples (nuclear and cytoplasmic of infant and pubertal Sc) and generation of a comprehensive SWATH-assay library, ensured the availability of identification spectra (high-quality spectra matching to a specific peptide) of all those proteins that were present in high abundance even in one of the samples. The availability of identification spectra for such a wide range of proteins in the assay library ensured its quantification by SWATH-MS analysis in all the samples even when it was present in low abundance in some samples. Thus, such comprehensive proteome quantification workflow enabled us to conduct quantitative analysis across all proteome fractions at an unprecedented quantitative depth, fulfilling our objective of quantifying most of the differentially expressed proteins among the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of infant and pubertal Sc. This is the first report of quantification of such a wide range of proteins in Sc utilizing next generation proteomic SWATH-MS analysis.GATA 4 and GATA zinc finger protein (Gatad2a) was found to be in high abundance in nucleus of pubertal Sc (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). GATA box also appeared in our TFBS analysis, whose binding sites were found to be in high abundance in the promoters of upregulated genes of pubertal Sc. Only few of the proteins found in our TFBS interactome analysis could be quantified using our SWATH-MS analysis. This is mainly because of low abundance of TFs in general, whose inclusion in a SWATH assay library demands their detection using a very specialized strategy (acquisition of transition list using peptides specific to a particular transcription factor obtained from invitro synthesis) of mass spectrometry.40 However, this can be performed when the complete SWATH-assay library of rat covering all expressed ORF’s becomes publicly available in SWATHAtlas (www.swathatlas.org) (5 December 2016, date last accessed). 3.4. Differential set of unique PTM signatures in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome of infant and pubertal ScSince activity of proteins (TFs, signalling components etc) depends heavily on the PTMs, we interrogated our shotgun proteomic data of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, which revealed numerous PTMs in each proteome fraction. Most of the PTMs obtained were exclusive to their nuclear or cytoplasmic presence in a specific age group, though some overlap was there amongst them (Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary Tables S9). This was expected since both the stages of Sc are characteristically distinct from each other. The exclusive appearance of the PTMs in their respective proteome fraction suggested the uniqueness of each proteome. All PTMs obtained in different proteome fractions (nuclear and cytoplasmic of infant and pubertal Sc) were categorized and represented in terms of the absence or presence of a particular PTM in a particular proteome. All the PTMs identified across all fractions were analysed for categorical representation (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Table S10).

However, its nuclear enrichment with respect to cytoplasm was found to be approximately same in infant and pubertal Sc. Similarly, Rho-GDI alpha was found to be succinylated in the nucleus only in infant Sc, having roughly same nuclear enrichment in infant and pubertal Sc. All these observation suggested our analysis to be a powerful resource for further studies on postnatal maturation of a cell type.3.5. Invivo validation using transgenic knockdown rat modelThe TRANSFAC and SWATH-MS analysis of this study provided a very powerful resource based on which several biological follow-up studies can be undertaken. In order to authenticate it, we intended to validate the role of one of the lead candidates obtained from this study. YY1 was one such lead candidate found in this study. Our TRANSFAC analysis showed high abundance of the binding sites of YY1 on the promoters of the genes upregulated in pubertal Sc. The SWATH-MS analysis also suggested YY1 to be localized in the nucleus of pubertal Sc. Immunostaining studies of cultured pubertal Sc further established the nuclear localization of YY1 (Fig. 7A). Immunohistochemistry studies of pubertal testis section was also performed in order to confirm the nuclear localization of YY1 in pubertal Sc at invivo conditions (Supplementary Figure S3).These observations suggested a strong basis for in vivo validation of TF YY1 in Sc differentiation. To this end, we have generated a transgenic knockdown rat model of YY1 for invivo validation of its role in Sc differentiation. In order to do so, we generated a transgenic rat that expressed shRNA against YY1 under Pem promoter. The expression of Pem promoter is restricted only in Sc from puberty onwards.41 Thus, YY1 knockdown rat model (YY1-KD) was supposed to have low abundance of YY1 in pubertal and adult Sc. The control animals were also generated employing similar strategy, expressing shRNA targeted to Luciferase (Luc-KD).

As expected, the level of Anti-Mullerian Hormone (Amh), a marker of immature Sc42 was found to be significantly high in the YY1 knockdown rats as compared to the age-matched control animals (Fig. 7C). Histological studies revealed reduction in seminiferous tubule size of knockdown rats by 35% (Fig. 7D and E). On account of the presence of relatively less matured Sc in YY1 knockdown rats, their sperm count declined by 60% as compared to the control animals (Fig. 7E). The level of Gdnf also declined significantly (P < 0.05) in the YY1 knockdown rats as compared to the controls (Fig. 7C). It was previously reported that Gdnf is required for self renewal of Spermatogonial stem cells.43 Low level of Gdnf in the YY1 knockdown rats explained its compromised ability to support quantitatively normal spermatogenesis leading to reduced sperm count.In an attempt to determine the comprehensive alteration in the transcriptome profile on account of the knockdown of YY1, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) of testicular RNA. It was found that 191 genes were differentially expressed significantly (P < 0.05) in YY1 knockdown rats as compared to the age-matched control animals (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, we observed that the promoters of 64 genes out of these 191 differentially expressed genes harbouring at least one YY1 binding sites within close proximity (±2 kb) of their TSS (Fig. 8B). GO analysis of these 191 differentially expressed genes using GeneCodis44 suggested that these genes are known to be involved in important cellular processes (Fig. 8C). This indicated the importance of YY1 in maintenance of normal functional status of pubertal Sc. In our transcriptomic analysis, genes like Npy4r had several fold higher expression in YY1 knockdown rat as compared to control animals (Fig. 8A) which was also validated by real time PCR (Supplementary Figure S4). Npy4r is known to play an important role in obesity.45 Its elevated level in pubertal Sc might be interesting for future studies. On the other hand, Krt72, a keratin protein was found down-regulated in YY1 knockdown rats (Fig. 8A), which was also confirmed by real time PCR (Supplementary Figure S4). Future studies on functional link between Krt72 and YY1 might be interesting. Figure 8Open in new tabDownload slideTranscriptome analysis of YY1 knockdown animals.

All these observations suggested that YY1 plays a crucial role in Sc differentiation and therefore attainment of functional maturity. This study was conducted using knockdown approach and thus ended up in partial loss of function of Sc in knockdown rats in terms of sperm count. Sc specific as well as puberty specific knockout of YY1 (using Pem promoter and lox-cre system) may result in complete loss of function of Sc. However, this invivo validation of the role of YY1 in Sc differentiation using knockdown approach provided basis for further studies using other lead candidates obtained in this study.The next-generation omics methodologies coupled together with computational integration of the TRANSFAC database used in this work exemplify the ability to rapidly divulge molecular bases of cellular differentiation. The computational prediction of differential abundance of TFBS on the promoters of the differentially regulated genes followed by the differential enrichment of nuclear proteins under two or more different context, using quantitative proteomics approach, would provide more precise information about functional regulation of different cellular states. Since functional aspects of proteins are well coordinated by the PTMs, the comprehensive PTM search in nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction of two cell type may be useful in deciphering the mechanism behind cellular programming from one state to another. This approach can be used to determine differentially acting sets of TFBS and nuclear proteins in any two altered states of a cell type.This study evaluated differential abundance of nuclear proteins and differential abundance of TFBS on the promoters of differentially expressed genes under the two different cellular contexts. Elucidation of such differentially acting sets of nuclear proteins and TFBS can provide substantial information to predict the differentially acting sets of signalling pathways of the two concerned cellular states. The knowledge about the differentially activated signalling pathways can also be correlated to the cohort of external stimulus acting on the cell.46–48 Altogether, the outcome of the whole work can be used to visualize the overall picture about the differentially acting molecular concert under two physiologically different states. To our knowledge, this is the first report with an unbiased approach to comprehensively interrogate differentially acting nuclear proteins and TFBS under the two or more cellular context using a multi-omic approach.Although at this point, robust correlative studies of differential TFs, TFBS and nucleus as well as cytoplasm-specific proteomes along with their pattern of PTM is not possible, availability of more advanced species-specific bioinformatics tools in future may allow one to do so. We believe that use of such multi-omics strategies in other system showing differential regulation of any function may pinpoint meaningful candidates which are crucial to such functions after reduction of the noise which is generated while using only single-omics approach. 3.6.

IntroductionNatural rubber is an indispensable biomass material produced from Hevea brasiliensis, or the para rubber tree, and its cis-1,4-polyisoprene polymer has superior characteristics that cannot be replaced by synthetic rubber produced from petroleum oils.1,2 The demand for it is increasing in accordance with advances in road and air transport, and medical devices.3In Malaysia rubber has been bred for better productivity and quality. It has been studied for about 90 years since the first rubber tree was imported. Rubber breeders have been crossing a few varieties to achieve high productivity and quality. In 2013, the first draft genome sequence of H. brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg. RRIM 600 was reported using 43-fold sequence coverage data.4 Recently, we reported a much more comprehensive RRIM 600 genome assembly based on ~155-fold coverage5 and, in addition, an assembly of Reyan7-33-97, another rubber cultivar genome, has been released that has 94-fold coverage.6 The burgeoning research interest in the para rubber tree reflects its significance as an important commodity crop globally.The rubber tree has very specialized cells in the bark around the vascular bundle called laticifer cells and latex is produced from these cells. It is composed of rubber serum and rubber particles. The particles are composed of lipid monolayers and it is suggested that there are several proteins localized on the surface of these. They include the rubber elongation factor (REF), small rubber particle protein (SRPP), and cis-prenyl transferase (CPT), and they are highly induced in latex compared with leaf and bark.7,8 REF and SRPP are the cause of rubber allergy.9,10 CPT functions as a polymerizing enzyme for the condensation reaction of isopentenyl diphosphate to form polyisoprene. Recently, the Nogo-B receptor (or CPTL) was reported as a component of the rubber particle11 but the complete picture of how natural rubber is produced is not clear.To further improve knowledge on latex production, we performed transcriptome analyses of full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) and RNA-Seq. The sequence information derived from FL-cDNA libraries provides exact transcribed regions, such as transcription units, splicing variants and transcription start sites (TSSs). We constructed rubber FL-cDNA libraries and collected 19,487 clones as bioresources. Using the Sanger and high throughput sequences from the rubber FL-cDNA libraries, we confirmed the transcripts of 7,704 loci and updated 5,466 with 22 novel loci. To increase the coverage of expressed genes, we further added public expressed sequence tags (ESTs),12–14 confirmed the expression of 23,790 loci and updated the annotation of 17,201 loci.RNA-Seq reveals the presence and quantity of genome-wide gene expression in biological samples. To predict the candidate genes related to rubber biosynthesis, we performed transcriptome analysis on four tissues (latex, bark, petiole and leaf) and on three rubber cultivars (RRIM 600, PB 350 and RRIM 901). RRIM 600 is an average latex-yielding cultivar with a production of ~1,350 kg of latex per hectare per year in estates over 20 years old. This cultivar is susceptible to disease caused by the pathogenic fungal Phytophthora spp. On the other hand, PB 350 is a latex-timber (~1,862 kg/ha/year), disease-resistant cultivar and RRIM 901 produces a higher latex yield (~1,971 kg/ha/year) when compared with RRIM 600.15 We also focus on the transcriptional regulatory factors of rubber biosynthesis and list transcription factors (TFs) that are highly expressed only in latex.2. Materials and Methods2.1. RNA isolation and construction of two FL-cDNA librariesSamples from leaf, petiole, bark and/or latex of RRIM 600 were collected from 2-, 5-, and 15-year-old trees located at Liman Plantation, Kedah, Malaysia (Supplementary Table S1). They were collected in the morning during the rainy season (November 2012 to January 2013). Total RNA from each tissue was extracted using a protocol optimized for rubber tree.16 RNA samples were purified with Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kits (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions in order to obtain high quality RNA. We mixed seven samples (Supplementary Table S1) to make two FL-cDNA libraries. Construction of the libraries from poly(A)+ RNA was performed using the biotinylated CAP-trapper method.17 The double-stranded FL-cDNAs were digested with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites of a <U+03BB>-FLC-III vector.18 The phage library was amplified on solid plates and phage particles were subsequently eluted with SM buffer. Plasmids were generated from the amplified phage library by in vitro excision. They were transformed into DH10B™ T1 phage-resistant Escherichiacoli and eluted with SOC medium with 13% glycerol. The titer of the two FL-cDNA plasmid libraries were (no. 1) 1.3 × 105 cfu/ml and (no 2) 7.6 × 105 cfu/ml (Fig. 1). When we checked the lengths of cDNAs in the two libraries with electrophoresis (data not shown), library no. 1 contained various lengths of cDNAs whereas library no. 2 had relatively short cDNAs. Since library no. 1 was contaminated with E. coli genomic DNA, we decided to use library no. 2 for Sanger sequencing of individual clones, and both libraries for Illumina sequencing (Fig. 1). For Sanger sequencing, we randomly selected 19,968 clones (52 plates of a 384 format) and cultured them in LB medium with 7% glycerol at 30 °C overnight.

FL-cDNA library no. 2: Sanger sequencing and quality controlEnd sequencing was performed by the Sanger method using ABI 3730xl capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The M13Fw (-20) primer (5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3') and the M13Rvdt primer (5'-GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3') were used for forward and reverse sequencing, respectively. The cDNA library was sequenced by the Sanger method from the 5' end and a total of 19,532 sequences were generated that had a Phred quality of =20. To reduce the number of clones to sequence from 3' end, we remove the duplicated sequences that show blast e-value = 1e-100 and identity =95%. 5,395 clones were selected and Sanger sequenced from 3' end. Of which, 4,915 sequences had a Phred quality of  =20. We applied 19,532 5' ESTs and 4,915 3' ESTs to SeqClean (http://sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean/), which validates and trims DNA sequences. Then, 19,487 5' ESTs and 4,480 3' ESTs were assembled by CAP319 with the following parameters (MinDistance = 100 bp and MaxDistance = 15000 bp).2.3. FL-cDNA library Nos. 1 and 2: Illumina sequencing and assemblyTotal DNA from two FL-cDNA libraries was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq DNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, USA) with 100 bp read length. Adapter sequences and poly-A were trimmed with cutadapt (v1.3),20 and FLC-III vector18 and E. coli genome21 sequences were removed using Bowtie 1.0.022 mapping software for no. 1 library . After these trimming and filtering processes, we assembled ESTs using Trinity (r2013-02-25) software23 with default parameters.2.4. Genome annotation with the FL-cDNA sequences and public ESTsWe applied both the Sanger sequenced FL-cDNA ESTs and Illumina sequenced data to the PASA (Programme to Assemble Spliced Alignments) pipeline24 and updated the gene models. In this pipeline, we used two alignment software programmes, GMAP25 and BLAT,26 with default parameters and we accepted only transcripts with over 75% coverage (–MIN_PERCENT_ALIGNED = 75) and over 95% identity (–MIN_AVG_PER_ID = 95). To increase the gene coverage, we collected three public EST datasets12–14: (i) Chow et al.12 obtained 9,860 ESTs (NCBI accession: EC600050–EC609910) of RRIM 600 latex; (ii) Triwitayakorn et al.13 sequenced 2,311,497 reads from the vegetative shoot apical tissue of RRIM 600 (DDBJ: DRA000170) and (iii) Salgado et al.14 extracted RNAs from 33 organs and seedlings from open pollination of RRIM 600 and obtained 19,708 assembled sequences. We applied these three publicly accessible EST sources to the PASA pipeline with the same flow as our analysis.2.5. TSS annotation with 5' FL-cDNA sequencesWe counted TSSs using 17,667 5' FL-cDNA sequences that were successfully mapped to the genome with over 75% coverage and over 95% identity. As a first step, we eliminated redundancy and determined 9,486 TSSs. These were located at 5,482 loci. More specifically, 8,864 TSSs were located 1000 bp upstream or inside 5,042 genic regions, 54 were located on the reverse strand of 42 genic regions (candidates for antisense transcripts) and the other 618 TSSs were clustered in 398 intergenic regions that were defined using a simple distance-based approach with a maximum allowed distance of 1,000 bp between two neighboring TSSs.2.6. RNA-Seq preparation and sequence analysisSampling, total RNA extraction and preparation of RNA-Seq libraries were performed using the same methods as for the FL-cDNA libraries (Supplementary Table S2). These libraries were high-throughput sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using directed paired-end technology (2 × 100 bp).To obtain more accurate results, we applied two mapping software programmes, TopHat v2.0.1327 and STAR version 020201.28 Cufflinks v2.2.129 assembled the mapped transcripts and calculated FPKM values for each sample.For quality control, we drew a clustering dendrogram and a distance matrix to identify outlier replicates using an R module of CummeRbund29 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Except for RRIM 901 latex, each two replicates showed the closest Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance in Supplementary Figure S2. Since the JS distance of the two RRIM 901 replicates (JS distance = 0.16) was smaller than the JS distances in other tissue combinations (JS distance > 0.2), we decided to take both data for subsequent analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2b).For gene set enrichment tests, we carried out a hypergeometric test to identify significantly enriched TF families or GO categories as follows:P - value = 1 - <U+2211>i=0m(jM)(n-iN-M)(nN)<U+2060>, where N is the total number of all genes with TF family (or GO category) annotation, n is the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in N, M is the number of genes in a given TF family (or GO category), and m is the number of DEGs in M. For this statistical calculation, we used SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/), which is a scientific library for Python. We then controlled the proportion of false positives by calculating the false discovery rate (FDR) corresponding to each P-value.29 The TF families (or GO categories) with a q-value of = 0.05 were defined as significantly enriched. The TF family and GO annotation were carried out in our previous work.53. Results and Discussion3.1. Cloning and data analysis of Sanger sequencing of rubber FL-cDNA libraryFL-cDNA sequences are important for correct annotation and identification of authentic transcripts from plant tissues. We constructed two FL-cDNA libraries from H. brasiliensis RRIM 600 whose draft genome was determined recently.5 Since library no. 1 was contaminated with E. coli genomic DNA, we used library no. 2 for constructing FL-cDNA clones and applied both libraries to Illumina sequencing (Fig. 1).After quality control, we obtained 19,487 FL-cDNA Sanger sequences from the 5' ends (Table 1). We removed 5' EST duplicates and selected 5,395 FL-cDNA clones. 4,840 clones were Sanger sequenced from their 3' ends with Phred quality = 20. A total of 24,327 FL-cDNA clones based on 5'/3' ESTs were assembled into 4,590 contigs with CAP3, a DNA sequence assembly programme31 that also output 3,570 singletons. Of the 4,590 contigs, 3,011 (65.6%) were reached from both ends. We applied the PASA pipeline to annotate 8,160 unigenes (the sum of contigs and singletons) and they were mapped to 6,883 clustered positions. They were annotated as 3,877 known genes with 116 new isoforms and 258 structural gene modifications. Summary of sequence resources of FL-cDNAsaThe number of reads per contig was 4.5.Summary of sequence resources of FL-cDNAsaThe number of reads per contig was 4.5.We also confirmed the functional bias of our FL-cDNA clones with GO slim31 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In most of the GO terms, the percentage of the cloned FL-cDNAs was around 10% of all GO annotation. The following 11 terms were enriched with a FDR adjusted q-value = 0.05 in biological function: generation of precursor metabolites and energy (GO:0006091), biological_process (GO:0008150), photosynthesis (GO:0015979), catabolic process (GO:0009056), cellular homeostasis (GO:0019725), response to abiotic stimulus (GO:0009628), response to stress (GO:0006950), cellular component organization (GO:0016043), secondary metabolic process (GO:0019748). We infer that the enriched ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to stress’, ‘response to external stimulus’ terms are related to our sampling of rubber tapping and latex. Also, ‘pollen-pistil interactions’ (GO:0009875) showed the lowest percentage and matched our sampling.3.2. Data analysis of Illumina-sequenced rubber FL-cDNA libraryAdditionally to the Sanger-sequenced FL-cDNA clones, we sequenced our two FL-cDNA libraries with Illumina HiSeq 2000 and obtained 169,017,764 raw reads. After quality control, we used 81,624,108 trimmed and filtered read pairs and assembled them with Trinity.23 As a result, we obtained 15,683 assembled contigs. When we compared the Sanger- and Illumina-sequenced FL-cDNA contigs, it was found that 99% of the Sanger unigenes overlapped with the Illumina contigs.We mapped all 23,843 FL-cDNA unigenes to the newly updated rubber genome,5 and 91.4% of them successfully mapped on the new draft genome while 80.4% mapped on the previous draft sequence (Supplementary Table S3). This high percentage suggests that the NGS sequenced data are efficient at collecting authentic transcripts. The results also suggest that the newest RRIM 600 draft genome has more comprehensive structural gene information than the previous one.3.3. Structural gene modification with RIKEN FL-cDNA libraries and public EST dataWe applied the PASA pipeline24 to update the current gene annotation. The PASA improved the 5,466 known genes and the 22 newly defined genes including four isoforms (Table 2). Details of the 5,466 modifications are as follows: 165 genes were fused into 78 genes and 3 genes were divided into 6 genes; 238 isoforms against 218 loci were newly annotated; 2,605 loci were improved in their 5' and/or 3' UTRs and a total of 2,901 annotated protein sequences were updated. Statistics of updated structural gene annotation in H. brasiliensis.Statistics of updated structural gene annotation in H. brasiliensis.Since our FL-cDNA sequences cover only 9.1% (7,704 genes out of 84,440 predicted rubber genes) of all the structural genes in H. brasiliensis, we used publicly available ESTs from three publications7–9 and compared these with the new rubber genome. As a result, the coverage was raised to 28.2% (23,790 genes) and the annotation of 17,201 genes was improved (Table 2). We think that the excessive numbers of current gene predictions cause the limited gene coverage (see Section 3.5).3.4. TSSs from FL-5' ESTsThe PASA pipeline can use complete FL-cDNA sequences but not the 5' TSS information from 5' ESTs. For this reason, we separately analyzed rubber TSSs using 5' ESTs. We mapped 19,487 5' ESTs of FL-cDNA clones to the rubber genome. 17,667 5' ESTs were successfully mapped and this corresponds to 9,486 unique TSSs. Only 55 of our TSSs exactly matched with the current TSS annotation. This very limited overlap was similar to the result obtained with Sorghum FL-cDNAs.32,33 The 9,486 TSSs were located at 5,482 loci, which contain 5,042 annotated genes, 42 antisense and 398 intergenic regions. Of these 398, 28 mapped to rubber draft scaffolds that have no annotated genes.3.5. The gene coverage of multi-transcriptomic dataIt is estimated that there are 84,440 genes in the new RRIM 600 draft genome.5 This number is much larger compared with the 27,416 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana,34 21,573 genes in Jatropha curcas35 and 31,344 genes in Ricinus communis (castor bean).36 Since there are more and more transcriptome data, false-positive gene predictions result in fewer problems than false-negative predictions. When we map RNA-Seq data to a genome, we can ignore the false-positives because they show 0 expression. On the other hand, problems still arise relating to quality and prediction of new genes using only RNA-Seq data. Therefore, the current number may be the result of reducing false-negative predictions. It will be greatly reduced after further annotation as was the case in the human genome (currently 26,000 genes).37,38 Transcriptomic data such as FL-cDNAs, ESTs and RNA-Seq are key information required to distinguish functional genes and pseudogenes.We used six samples (leaf, petiole, bark and latex from RRIM 600 and latex from RRIM 901 and PB350) for RNA-Seq (Supplementary Table S2). In total, we obtained 118.8 Gb of RNA-Seq data (an average of 48 million reads) from the six samples with two replicates. These data were analyzed using two mapping software programmes, TopHat26 and STAR27. With our RNA-Seq data, STAR showed ~10% better mapping ratio than TopHat (Supplementary Table S4). Engström et al.39 reported that TopHat showed lower tolerance for mismatches than STAR. As we consider that the current rubber draft genome still has many mismatches, we decided to use the mapping results from STAR for further analyses.As a result of RNA-Seq, we confirmed that 36,544 genes were expressed in at least one of our samples with the criterion of FPKM > 0. Combining these with the 23,790 expressed genes obtained from the FL-cDNAs and ESTs, a total of 38,986 expressed genes (46.2% of the annotated genes) are validated in our analysis.3.6. Tissue- and cultivar-specific gene expression based on RNA-SeqTo investigate the important genes involved in rubber biosynthesis, we compared RNA expression of leaves, petioles, bark and latex in 15-year-old RRIM 600 plants. We found 24,821 genes were commonly expressed in all tissues and 745 genes were uniquely expressed in latex (Fig. 2a). GO enrichment analysis of the 745 latex-specific genes showed that enzymatic activities (transferase activity (GO:0016740), kinase activity (GO:0016301), enzyme regulatory activity (GO:0030234), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787)) and binding (GO:0005488) were significantly enriched with a FDR adjusted q-value < 0.05. The total number of expressed genes is at least 4,000 fewer in latex than in other tissues (Supplementary Table S5).

We defined expressed genes with FPKM > 0.In Malaysia rubber has been improved by conventional breeding programmes, which have created cultivars with high and low latex yields. We have analyzed two other cultivars, RRIM 901 that has a high latex yield and PB 350 that yields a moderate amount of latex but has improved disease resistance and high timber production. Our results show that 24,081 genes were commonly expressed and 800-1,100 genes were specifically expressed in these cultivars (Fig. 2b).We looked into whether the 745 latex-specific genes in RRIM 600 are also expressed in other cultivars. Although 96.7% of the expressed genes in RRIM 600 were shared with RRIM 901 and/or PB 350 (Fig. 2b), only 50.5% of the latex-specific genes in RRIM 600 were shared with RRIM 901 and/or PB 350. In addition, although we expected that the highly expressed latex-specific genes in RRIM 600 would be similar in all the cultivars, we did not find that this was the case (Supplementary Table S6). It is unlikely that essential genes for latex synthesis are different between cultivars. Tissue-specificity might be less important to elucidate complete pathway of latex synthesis.To search for the key factors that confer higher latex yield in RRIM 901, we examined genes whose expression in latex is over 10 times higher in RRIM 901 than in RRIM 600 (Supplementary Table S7). At this threshold, most of the genes are categorized as having unknown function. When we considered genes whose expression is five times higher in RRIM 901 compared with RRIM 600 we found they belonged to several GO classes: growth (GO:0040007), cellular homeostasis (GO:0019725), lipid binding (GO:0008289), biological process (GO:0008150) and protein metabolic process (GO:0019538). These genes are candidates for the factor or factors that confer high latex production in RRIM 901.3.7. Expression profile of isoprenoid biosynthesis genesNatural rubber is a biopolymer consisting of cis-1,4-polyisoprene which is formed from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). IPP is synthesized by the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway from acetyl-CoA.40 As an alternative route, the plastidic 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate has also been demonstrated.41 Using RNA-Seq technology, we have confirmed the expression of 37 genes in the MVA pathway and 21 in the MEP pathway, and they are defined in our previous genome article5 (Fig. 3). As a comparison of their expression in RRIM 600 latex, genes in the MVA pathway (the average FPKM is 80.3) are more highly expressed than the genes in the MEP pathway (the average FPKM is 10.0). Also, the average FPKM value of CMK (4-(cytidine 5-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase) in the MEP pathway was only 0.2 in the latex. This result is the same in both the PB 350 and the RRM 901 latex. Our data suggest that MVA is the main IPP synthetic pathway in latex. Also, the expression levels of the genes in the MEP pathway are higher in non-latex samples (leaf, petiole, and bark) compared with latex. This high expression in non-latex samples may be associated with non-latex terpenoid biosynthesis. IPP isomerase is known as a key rate-limiting step of terpenoid biosynthesis.42 Our data indicate that the expression level of the IPP isomerase gene in latex is also low and so, in order to enhance latex production, this gene can be an ideal candidate for modification of expression and activity.

Expression profile of rubber biosynthesis genesLatex is an emulsion of rubber serum and rubber particles produced from laticifer cells localized in the outer layers of the vascular bundle of the bark. A rubber particle is composed of a lipid monolayer membrane and it is suggested that there are three major rubber-related proteins (CPTs, REFs and SRPPs) localized on the surface of this particle. We confirmed the expression of 7 CPTs, 1 CPTL, 9 REFs and 8 SRPPs (Fig. 3). We found that CPT1, CPT2, CPTL, REF1, REF2 and SRPP1 were expressed at least 20 times more in latex than in leaf. The newly identified REF8 from the latest RRIM 600 draft genome sequence also shows a similar expression pattern to REF1 and REF2. This protein sequence has a REF domain and shows 59% identity with 90/117 amino acid alignment to SRPP1 with blastp. Its FPKM value is 11,221 and its level is 250 times higher in latex than in leaves. Therefore, REF8 is a candidate for further experimental validation to allow more characterization of its function.When we calculated the correlation coefficients of all FPKM values between each sample, latex is more highly correlated in bark (correlation coefficient is 0.82) than in the petiole and leaf (correlation coefficient is 0.75–0.76) (Supplementary Fig. S3). Unlike the overall trend, many of the well-studied latex polymerization-related factors, such as CPTL, CPT2, REF1, REF2 and SRPP1, showed high expression in latex and petioles, but not in bark (Fig. 3). Since the petiole can produce a small amount of latex such a correlation may explain this observation.3.9. Candidate TFs that regulate rubber biosynthesis genesLittle is known about the transcriptional regulation of rubber biosynthesis genes. We calculated the FPKM value for the 3,126 predicted TFs and selected 39 whose average FPKM value of three latex samples was more than five times higher than the average FPKM value of other tissues (Supplementary Table S8). We carried out gene set enrichment analysis against TF families and four of them were significant with a FDR adjusted q-value < 0.05 (Table 3). The C2C2-Dof,43 TAZ44 and AP245 families are related to the stress response. Since latex is exuded after tissue injury, these TFs are important candidate regulators. The cis-element of AP2 is known in A.thaliana and we confirmed partially similar motifs in the promoters of the CPT genes (Table 3).

Expression profile for disease-resistance genesCorynespora leaf fall disease caused by infection with Corynespora cassiicola is one of the major fungal diseases in rubber plantations and it can cause a severe reduction in rubber latex production.46 We performed cultivar-specific RNA-Seq analysis using the C. cassiicola resistant cultivar PB 350 and the susceptible cultivars RRIM 600 and 901. At first we focused on 483 disease-resistance genes (R genes) that play important roles in the response against the pathogen. In normal or uninfected tissue, the expression of the R genes in PB 350 was the same or slightly lower than RRIM 600 and 901 (Supplementary Fig. S4). We also examined genes whose expression in PB 350 is over 10 times higher than in RRIM 600 and detected 41 genes (Supplementary Table S9). 40% (17 out of 41) of these are enriched with heat shock proteins (HSPs). Since HSPs are known to be critical for the plant defense response and some function as chaperones of R proteins for effector-triggered immunity,47 HSPs are likely to be important regulatory factors for the pathogen-stress response in rubber and contribute to the higher disease resistance of PB 350.4. ConclusionThis study is the first large-scale collection of FL-cDNAs in H. brasiliensis in which 19,487 FL-cDNA clones harboring genetic information for 7,704 known genes and 22 new genes were obtained. The FL-cDNAs also provide 9,486 TSSs but the current coverage is not enough to carry out comprehensive TSS analysis. For better understanding, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression profiling or other genome-wide expression analyses will be necessary.In this study, we used our newly sequenced rubber draft genome as a reference for transcriptome analysis.5 The genome sequence offers a more robust analysis of the generated RNA-Seq data in turn giving a more accurate expression profile analysis as the gene models will be more precise. Our findings reveal the tissue-specific expression patterns of the rubber biosynthesis genes and list candidate transcriptional regulators.Our FL-cDNA sequences and RNA de novo assembly will be useful information for future improvement of the rubber tree and also as a basis for comparative analysis with other economically important Euphorbiaceae, such as cassava and the castor oil plant.Data AvailabilityOur FL-cDNA sequence data and RNA-Seq data are available at DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank BioProject under accession PRJDB4387.

IntroductionLysobacter enzymogenes M497-1 (formerly Achromobacter lyticus) was originally isolated from a Japanese soil sample and identified as A.lyticus within the class Betaproteobacteria by Isono et al.1 It was registered as a producer of the bacteriolytic enzyme lysyl endopeptidase (US patent no. 3,649,454) in 1972.1 The achromopeptidase (lysyl endopeptidase) produced by this strain2–6 has broad bacteriolytic specificity and has been used for the lysis of anaerobic gram-positive rods, including various Actinomycetales and Bifidobacterium species,7 and gram-positive cocci, such as Micrococcus radiodurans,8, Staphylococcus aureus,9 and Peptococcus saccharolyticus.10 The commercialized achromopeptidase is widely employed in metagenomic analyses of the human gut microbiome, which contains anaerobic cocci and rods insensitive to lysozyme, because it enables stable and highly efficient lysis (>90%) of human intestinal microorganisms.11 Other types of proteolytic enzymes produced by strain M497-1 include a- and ß-lytic proteases.12–14Lysobacter species share some properties, including the ability to lyse prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, high genomic G + C content (65–70%), and gliding motility, with plant-associated myxobacteria, although Lysobacter species have never been observed to form fruiting bodies, which are typical for myxobacteria. Consequently, Lysobacter species have been occasionally misidentified as myxobacteria in the older literature,15–20 but this taxonomic problem was resolved in 1978 by creating a new genus, Lysobacter, within the class Gammaproteobacteria.21,22 To clarify the taxonomic position of A. lyticus M497-1, which produces lytic enzymes similar to those of Lysobacter species,23–25 we conducted a sequence homology search based on the 16S rRNA gene amplified by PCR from M497-1 DNA remaining in the commercial crude enzyme preparation, and we found 99.9% identity with the 16S rRNA of L. enzymogenes (formerly Myxobacter) strain 495.15L. enzymogenes is a versatile bacterium producing various types of lytic enzymes specific not only for bacteria7–10,12–14 but also for eukaryotic cells. Consequently, several L. enzymogenes strains have been characterized as biological control agents against plant diseases caused by fungi such as Bipolaris sorokiniana19,20 and Uromyces appendiculatus,26 filamentous protists such as Pythium aphanidermatum (class Oomycota),27 and roundworms28 such as the sugar-beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. L. enzymogenes-derived chitinases can inhibit conidial germination of plant pathogens and degrade egg shells and hatched juveniles of nematodes20,28–31, while ß-1,3-glucanases from the bacterium can lyse the cell walls of pathogenic fungi.32,33 Furthermore, Lysobacter species are known to synthesize other antimicrobial agents such as tripropeptins34,35 and lycosin E,36 which are active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, respectively.Over 40 species within the genus Lysobacter have been registered in the NCBI taxonomy database, and recently, the complete genomes of 4 species (L. antibioticus, L. capsici, L. enzymogenes, and L. gummosus) have been sequenced.37 The genome sequence data are very useful to elucidate the intragenus as well as intraspecies genomic diversity. Here, we compared the genomes of M497-1 and 4 other Lysobacter species to determine the core genomic structure of the genus Lysobacter, and explored the genetic, metabolic, and physiological potential of M497-1, which could be exploited in biotechnological applications.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and cultivationL. enzymogenes strain M497-1 was kindly supplied by Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), Ltd. This strain was deposited to the American Type Culture Collection as Lysobacter sp. (ATCC 21456). M497-1 was aerobically grown at 30 °C in 500-ml flasks containing 100 ml of medium for 24 or 48 h. For DNA analysis, the bacteria were grown in CY medium containing 0.5% casitone and 0.1% yeast extract, and for RNA expression analysis, they were cultured in medium containing 1.5% glycerol, 0.3% NaCl, 0.5%, l-glutamate monohydrate (pH 7.4), and 1.5% cotton seed meal (Traders Protein, Southern Cotton Oil Company, Memphis, TN, USA).2.2. DNA and RNA purificationGenomic DNA was extracted and purified using the NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was extracted and purified from 24-h and 48-h M497-1 cultures using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini kit and QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNase I-treated RNA was re-purified using the RNeasy Mini Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) and rRNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Gram-Negative Bacteria) (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA).2.3. Sequencing, assembly, and data analysesFor whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we combined the Roche GS FLX (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan) and Sanger sequencing technologies, which produced ~53- and 23-fold genome coverage, respectively. First, GS FLX reads with an average length of 231 bp were assembled using the Newbler programme version 2.3, and 385 contigs with an N50 length of 33,738 bp were generated. Next, we performed end-sequencing of 77,952 and 1,920 clones from 2–3 to 35–40 kb (fosmid) insert-size libraries, respectively, using an ABI 3730xl sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Yokohama, Japan), and hybrid assembly was carried out by the KB Basecaller and Phrap/Consed programmes.38 The remaining gaps between contigs were filled in using PCR and Sanger sequencing of amplified products. In addition, low-quality genomic regions were sequenced to increase the genome coverage.RNA-seq libraries were prepared from 24- to 48-h cultures according to the standard Illumina protocol and cDNA libraries were checked for quality and quantity using the DNA-100 kit (Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer. Each library was sequenced with the Illumina Sequencing Kit v2 on one lane of a MiSeq desktop sequencer (Illumina K.K., Tokyo, Japan) to obtain 150-bp average paired-end reads. The value of Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) was calculated according to the standard method. The RPKM ratio was calculated by dividing the RPKM of each gene by the mean RPKM of all ribosomal proteins, and was used to determine relative gene expression levels. Promoter-like sequences were detected with GENETYX-MAC version 18 (Tokyo, Japan) and PePPER39 (http://pepper.molgenrug.nl/index.php/prokaryote-promoters). Peptidase genes were identified by BLAST searches and from the MEROPS database of proteolytic enzymes; MEROPS identifiers were assigned on the basis of a phylogenetic tree: an identifier was assigned to all sequences derived from the same node as a holotype.402.4. Orthologous analysis and estimation of gene clusters for biosynthesis of natural productOrthologous groups (OGs) for M497-1 and 4 other Lysobacter species37 were constructed using the rapid classification programme DomClust41 on the Microbial Genome Database (MBGD) server.42 A core genome is defined as a set of genes (OGs) syntenically conserved in at least half of the compared strains. In our study, a set of genes in the syntenic regions shared by at least three strains was defined as the core genome for the five analysed Lysobacter strains. A set of syntenic regions and the consensus order of OGs in these regions designated ‘core genome structure’ were created using the CoreAligner programme43 based on conserved linkages between orthologous genes in each chromosome. Among the OGs in the core genome, those present in all the genomes were called ‘universal core genome’. Non-ribosomal protein synthase (NRPS)- and polyketide synthase (PKS)-encoding genes were manually annotated using web-based prediction programmes.44–47 Gene clusters related to biosynthesis of bioactive natural product were estimated based on gene direction and continuity in the M497-1 genome and compared with previously identified gene clusters.2.5. Evaluation of the metabolic and physiological potentialThe metabolic and physiological potential of L. enzymogenes M497-1 was investigated using Metabolic and Physiological Potential Evaluator (MAPLE) ver. 2.1.48 Genes were mapped to functional modules defined by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (pathways: 255, complexes: 284, functional sets: 149, signatures: 40) and the module completion ratio (MCR) was calculated according to a Boolean algebra-like equation described previously.49 The MCR patterns of M497-1 were compared with those of other Lysobacter species.3. Results and discussion3.1. General features of the L. enzymogenes M497-1 genomeThe genome of L. enzymogenes M497-1 consists of a single circular chromosome (6,096,022 bp) with a mean G + C content of 69.4% (Fig. 1A). We identified 4,891 protein-coding sequences (CDSs), 55 transfer RNA genes, and 6 rRNA genes comprising 2 rRNA operons (Table S1). Although there was no significant difference in genome size between L. enzymogenes strains M497-1 and C3, the former has 638 CDSs fewer than the latter. M497-1 and C3 shared 4,043 OGs, while they had 488 and 1,022 unique genes, respectively. Among 485 M497-1 genes unique to the 5 Lysobacter spp. (L. enzymogenes M497-1 and C3, L. antibioticus 76, L. capsici 55, and L. gummosus 3.2.11), 8 encoded peptidases and 16 encoded NRPSs and PKSs, while the function of 338 unique genes (70%) is not known. Among the functionally unknown genes, 11 showed an RPKM ratio higher than 2 in 24-h culture; LEN_1053 had the highest RPKM ratio (186) among all genes identified in the M497-1 genome. The original RPKM values and RPKM ratios for all genes are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideGenomic structure of Lysobacter sp.

Origins of replication are at the center.The core genome structure of the five Lysobacter strains was defined using CoreAligner43; it contains a set of well-conserved syntenic OGs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Out of 4,891 CDSs in the M497-1 genome, 3,593 were included in the core genome comprising 3,737 OGs; among them, 3,081 were shared by all 5 strains and thus, represented universal core gene clusters. In total, 3,046 OGs show one-to-one correspondence (Fig. 1B). Types III and IV secretion pathways are highly conserved in the M497-1 genome as well as in those of other Lysobacter species (Supplementary Fig. S2).37 All genes of L. enzymogenes M497-1 related to type III secretion (LEN_4800, LEN_4801, LEN_4803, and LEN_4806–4815) were included in the universal core gene cluster (Table S2). However, three genes related to the type IV secretion pathway (LEN_2216–2218) were not included in the universal core as they were not identified as orthologs in the L. antibioticus 76 genome by the MBGD server, although the gene organization of the adjacent region was well conserved. The RPKM ratios of genes related to type IV secretion in the M497 genome varied; 6 out of 10 genes (LEN_2207, LEN_2209, LEN_2211, and LEN_2213–2215) demonstrated almost equal or higher expression than the average level for ribosomal proteins in 24-h culture. In particular, LEN_2213 and LEN_2214 showed RPKM ratios of ~9–10; however, the expression level dramatically decreased in 48-h culture, indicating that type IV secretion is active in the exponential growth phase. In contrast to the type IV secretion genes, most genes related to the type III secretion pathway showed 5- to 10-fold lower expression levels than ribosomal proteins.Iron uptake is vital for almost all bacteria because iron is used as a cofactor in key metabolic processes, including deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and electron transport. To survive under iron-limiting conditions, bacteria have developed sophisticated iron acquisition strategies based on the secretion of iron-chelating siderophores.50 TonB-dependent transporters are bacterial outer membrane receptor proteins that bind and translocate siderophores as well as vitamin B12, nickel complexes, and carbohydrates.51 We found that the Lysobacter strains possess a remarkable number of genes encoding the TonB-dependent family of proteins, of which 52 and 41 were included in the core and universal core gene clusters, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Considering that Lysobacter spp. are inhabitants of soil and water, which are characterized by low bioavailability of iron, the high number of TonB-dependent proteins should be helpful for iron acquisition. In fact, seven genes included in the core OGs (LEN_0009, LEN_0351, LEN_3594, LEN_3807, LEN_4109, LEN_4624, and LEN_4786) in the M497-1 genome showed an expression level equal to or higher than that of ribosomal proteins in 24-h culture; among them, the highest RPKM ratio (more than 10) was observed for LEN_4109.3.2. Bacteriolytic enzymesOne hundred seventeen genes encoding peptidases, including the commercialized lysyl endopeptidase (LEN_1308), were identified in the M497-1 genome. These peptidase genes were classified into 56 families according to the MEROPS peptidase database.40 The largest family, S08A, comprised 21 peptidases, and the S01A family contained LEN_1308 together with 2 other peptidases, LEN_1307 and LEN_1765 (Supplementary Table S4). Among all peptidase genes, 80 were included in the universal core gene clusters (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S3) and 16 showed an expression level equal to or higher than the average level of ribosomal proteins in 24-h culture (Supplementary Fig. S3); LEN_4116 (ß-lytic protease) of the M23A family showed an RPKM ratio of ~30. However, the expression level of these 16 genes dramatically decreased after 48 h (Supplementary Fig. S3). In gram-positive bacilli, among which are various industrial enzyme producers, protease production usually starts from the early stationary phase of cultivation (20–24 h), and the productivity is maintained even at the late stationary phase (48 h).52 In contrast to bacilli, L. enzymogenes M497-1 easily lyse after reaching the stationary phase; cell lysis was actually observed after 24 h of cultivation (data not shown), likely due to autolysis by autoproduced peptidases.

Among the other genes in the peptidase island (LEN_1301–1306), another s54-dependent promoter-like region was detected for LEN_1301, suggesting polycistronic expression of the LEN_1301–1306 region; however, expression was very low compared with the average level of ribosomal proteins (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, expression of 4 peptidase genes (LEN_1590, LEN_1765, LEN_1799, and LEN_3019) was detected, while no putative promoter-like sequences were identified (Supplementary Fig. S3). Our manual search for other types of promoter-like regions was not successful either, probably because promoters depending on different s factors are likely to have significant sequence variability.3.3. Lytic enzymes having activity against eukaryotic cellsL. enzymogenes is known to protect plant from diseases caused by various fungi, filamentous protists, and nematodes. Chitinase is a hydrolytic enzyme cleaving glycosidic bonds in chitin, a component of fungal cell walls and of exoskeleton of lower animals, including nematodes. L. enzymogenes M497-1 has 3 chitinase-encoding genes belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 18 and 19; all of these genes were included in the universal core OGs (Fig. 3A). Among them, LEN_2961 demonstrated significant expression in 24-h culture, as evidenced by its RPKM ratio of 3.9, while the other two genes (LEN_3788 and LEN_4456) were expressed at levels below the average of ribosomal proteins; upstream of each gene, putative s54-dependent promoter-like sequences were detected (Fig. 3B).

L. enzymogenes C3 lacks an orthologous gene corresponding to LEN_1176 (family 6), while L. antibioticus 76 and L gummosus 3.2.11 do not have orthologs of LEN_4406 (family 16) (Fig. 3B). Except for LEN_3546, endoglucanase/ß-1,3-glucanase-encoding genes were significantly expressed (relative RPKM ratio of 1.5 and higher in 24-h culture); the highest levels were observed for LEN_0845 (family 8), which demonstrated RPKM ratios of almost 10 and 2 in 24-h and 48-h cultures, respectively. However, no s54-dependent promoter-like sequences could be detected for these genes.3.4. Natural productsAlthough natural products from gram-positive actinomycetes have been extensively studied,53 those from gram-negative bacteria have received little attention. However, a number of Lysobacter spp. are currently recognized as promising antibiotic producers.54 In the L. enzymogenes M497-1 genome, we found 98 genes related to the biosynthesis of natural products such as lantibiotics, non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide compounds, and siderophores (Supplementary Table S5); to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest number of such genes identified in Lysobacter genomes. However, none of these genes, except for LEN_4535, was included in the universal core OGs, although some of them had orthologous relationships to those of other Lysobacter strains. Among the 98 genes, 31 encoded NRPSs, type I PKSs, and NRPS/PKS hybrids comprising various catalytic domains, and 12 of them, LEN_2075-2077, LEN_2515–2517 and LEN_2548–2551 (NRPS/PKS), LEN_2803 (type I PKS), and LEN_4535 (NRPS) were well conserved at similar positions in the genomes of L. enzymogenes stains M497-1 and C3 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S6). On the other hand, M497-1 was found to have many unique genes, especially for type I PKS and NRPS/PKS hybrids, which have not yet been identified in other fully sequenced Lysobacter spp. (Supplementary Table S6). Furthermore, 9 out of 20 genes responsible for NRPS were also unique in M497-1. These unique genes might have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer because they showed 40–60% sequence identity with those of several species within phylogenetically distant genera Rhodococcus, Polyangium, Bradyrhizobium, except for Xanthomonas, within the same family. Unfortunately, significant expression was observed only for the NRPS cluster comprising LEN_4535 and LEN_4536, which showed RPKM ratios of 4–6 in 24-h culture and 2.5 in 48-h culture although the product was not identified in the culture medium. Although genes encoding types II and III PKSs (which are involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds) and genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpene compounds have been frequently found in Actinomycetales genomes, such genes were not identified in the M497-1 genome. Interestingly, the region LEN_2603–LEN_2673 (ca. 145 kb) was extremely similar to that containing a gene cluster for lysobactin biosynthesis of Lysobacter sp. ATCC 53042, which is a patent strain (accession no. JF412274). The lysobactin biosynthesis cluster comprising LG3211_2475, 2476 is also present in the L. gummosus 3.2.11 genome,37 and these genes showed significant identities (>70%) to LEN_2615 and LEN_2613. Through the analysis of a series of genes involved in lysobactin biosynthesis in Lysobacter sp. ATCC 53042, it was suggested that the region LEN_2608–LEN_2615 is responsible for the biosynthesis of lysobactin or related compounds.55 Although 2 NRPSs (LybA and LybB) of Lysobacter sp. ATCC 53042 are involved in the formation of the peptide backbone of lysobactin, 3 NRPSs (LEN_2613–2615) identified in the L. enzymogenes M497-1 genome were found to correspond to LybA and LybB; LEN_2615 corresponds to LybA, while LybB is divided into two NRPSs, LEN_2614 and LEN_2613. Thus, L. enzymogenes M497-1 is presumably able to produce lysobactin or related antibacterials. Notably, gene clusters encoding other antibiotics identified in Lysobacter species, such as heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF)/dihydromaltophilin, WAP-8294A2 (anti-MRSA), and phenazine,37 were not detected in M497-1.

Metabolic and physiological potentialTo compare the metabolic and physiological potential of M497-1 and other Lysobacter strains, the completion ratios of the four types of KEGG functional modules (pathway, structural complex, functional set and signature modules) were calculated with MAPLE (Supplementary Table S7).48 Most MCR patterns were similar among the 5 Lysobacter strains (Supplementary Fig. S4); however, several modules demonstrated species-specific differences (Fig. 5). Among them, there were seven pathway modules related to amino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. In the ornithine biosynthesis module comprising 5 reaction steps, L. enzymogenes M497-1 and L. gummosus 3.2.11 lacked amino-acid N-acetyltransferase (argA) assigned to the first reaction step. The module for dissimilatory nitrate reduction comprising two reaction steps was complete only in L. antibioticus 76, while the enzymes for each reaction step, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase, were absent in the other 4 species. Except for L. enzymogenes strains, the other three Lysobacter spp. completed the module for d-galactonate degradation, which is one of the rare modules, i.e. completed by less than 10% of prokaryotes.49Figure 5Open in new tabDownload slideMajor differences in metabolic and physiological potential among Lysobacter strains.

First 7 modules, pathways; next 10 modules, structural complexes; last 7 modules, functional sets. Modules defined as ‘rare’ are indicated with an asterisk.49The differences in MCR patterns among Lysobacter strains were also observed in structural-complex and functional-set modules. As a conspicuous example, only L. antibioticus 76 completed the modules for RTX (repeats in toxin) transport belonging to the type I secretion system, putrescine transport, phospholipid transport, aminoglycoside-resistant protease HtpX, and the osmotic stress response (EnvZ-OmpR) two-component regulatory system (Fig. 5). In addition, the modules for type VI secretion and simple sugar transport were completed only by L. enzymogenes C3 and L. capsici 55, respectively. Moreover, strain-specific differences between M497-1 and C3 were detected in 3 rare modules: the a-hemolysin/cyclolysin transport system and two-component regulatory systems associated with central carbon metabolism (BarA-UvrY) and chemosensing (WspE-WspRF). Thus, we could detect exact differences in the metabolic and physiological potential among five closely related Lysobacter species.3.6. Regulatory factorsThe production of bioactive products in Lysobacter strains is regulated by intracellular signaling mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate-receptor-like protein (Clp) and the diffusible signal factor (DSF)-dependent system.56–58 The Clp-encoding gene was identified in all Lysobacter genomes, including M497-1 (LEN_0938), and the deduced gene products were 99–100% identical to each other. LEN_0938 was highly expressed as evidenced by its RPKM ratio of 6.6, and the expression of various Clp-regulated genes, including those encoding lytic enzymes such as chitinase, endoglucanase/ß-1,3-glucanase, and peptidase, was also markedly induced (Supplementary Table S2). These data are consistent with previous reports that Clp upregulated the expression of chitinase, ß-1,3-glucanse, peptidase, and antifungal factor in L. enzymogenes C3 and OH11.57,58Genes encoding components of the DSF-dependent system (rpfG, rpfC, rpfF, and rpfB), which is widely conserved among Lysobacter species (with the exception of L. capsici), were also identified in the M497-1 genome (LEN_2756–2759). A previous study did not detect genes corresponding to rpfC and rpfF in L. capsici 55; however, two genes (LC55x_5419 and LC55x_5418) were assigned to the rpfF and rpfC OGs, respectively, by MBGD analysis.37 These genes showed 30–40% sequence similarity to phylogenetically distant species within different classes such as Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, suggesting that they might have been acquired by L. capsici 55 through horizontal gene transfer. L. enzymogenes OH11 produces a DSF-like protein, LeDSF3, which positively regulates HSAF biosynthesis through NRPS and the RpfC/RpfG-Clp pathway.58 However, in the M497-1 genome, the genes responsible for the DSF-dependent system (LEN_2756–2759) showed very low expression when compared with Clp (RPKM ratio 0.2–0.6 versus 6.6, respectively), and genes related to HSAF biosynthesis regulated by the DSF-dependent system were not identified.With regard to antibiotic production pathways, we found 16 genes related to type I PKS and NRPS to be unique to M497-1 (Supplementary Table S6). Additionally, all of them were silent, although three other orthologous genes (LEN_4535, LEN_2614, and LEN_2615) showed an expression level greater than half the average expression level of ribosomal proteins in a 24-h culture (>0.58). Further studies focusing on the regulatory mechanisms underlying antibiotic production in L. enzymogenes M497-1 will be required with regard to not only unique genes but also other orthologous genes to identify novel antibiotics synthesized by this strain.In conclusion, L. enzymogenes M497-1 genome sequencing and expression profiling performed in this study revealed 16 unique genes for biosynthesis of natural product and 15 highly expressed genes encoding peptidases except for commercialized achromopeptidase. It also represented the possibility to produce lysobactin or related antimicrobial compounds. Thus, our findings are expected to promote further biotechnological application of Lysobacter spp. as a promising source of natural, bioactive compounds.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank Mr T.

IntroductionThe Asterid clade is one of the most species-rich lineages of flowering plants, containing over a quarter of all known species of angiosperms (~80,000 of 300,000). In this clade are four of the 10 most diverse families of flowering plants: Asteraceae (Sunflowers: ~24,000 spp.), Rubiaceae (Coffee Family: ~11,200 spp.), Lamiaceae (Mint Family: ~7,200 spp.), and Acanthaceae (Acanthus Family: 4,200 spp.). Asterids are of tremendous economic and ecological significance, with cultivated and economically important members including coffee, mints (basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, lavender, teak), tomatoes and relatives (potatoes, tobacco, chilies, peppers, petunias), and carrots and relatives (carrots, cumin, cilantro, dill, fennel, parsley, celery), as well as blueberries, olives, sunflowers, sweet potatoes, snapdragons, dogwoods, ashes, milkweeds, and hollies.1 Members of the Asterid clade furthermore dominate ecosystems worldwide.2Despite a revolution in sequencing plant genomes over the last decade, there exists only a handful of plants in the Asterid clade with nuclear reference genomes (http://www.plantgdb.org/).3 These genomes derive primarily from the tomato family (Solanaceae) in which nine species have been sequenced (Solanum, four species: ~838–900 Mb;4–7,Nicotiana, three species: ~3 Gb;8,9,Capsicum, three species: ~3.48 Gb;10,11and Petunia, two species: ~1.4 Gb12). Beyond this, there exists only two additional reference genomes in the Asterid clade, only one of which is >100 Mb in size: the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus, ~430 Mb;13 the other derives from the insectivorous bladderwort Utricularia gibba, which is only ~81.9 Mb.14 Thus, only three of 100+ families that comprise Asterids have representative nuclear genomes.To build genomic resources for Asterids, we here contribute new nuclear genome reference from a fourth family in this clade: Acanthaceae. The genus Ruellia (Wild Petunias) contains ~400 species that are distributed primarily in the Neotropics and Paleotropics. With very few exceptions, all species of Ruellia (~50 species counted to date) are thought to be diploid and share a somatic chromosome count of 2n = 34 (reviewed by Tripp15 and Tripp16). Ruellia is marked by tremendous diversity in both flower shape and colour, with very closely related species (e.g. sister taxa) often divergent in floral form (Fig. 1).17 Flowers of Ruellia range from blue to purple, pink, red, green, yellow, and white and are pollinated by bees, butterflies, hawkmoths, bats, hummingbirds, and sunbirds.15,18 Owing to the floral diversity and species richness in the genus, Ruellia has potential as a future model system for floral evolution in angiosperms.

Materials and methods2.1. DNA isolation, library preparation, and sequencingPlant material for this study was collected in the wild by E. Tripp and S. Acosta (voucher # 175, housed at the Duke University Herbarium; in living cultivation in the University of Colorado Greenhouses), in a small canyon of a mountain that lies within the city limits of Oaxaca City, Oaxaca, Mexico. Total genomic DNA was extracted from young leaf tissue of R.speciosa using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Presence of high molecular weight DNA was confirmed by 1% agarose-gel electrophoresis stained with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen). DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorimeter spectrophotometer (Life Technology). DNA that passed quality control was used for mate-pair library preparation followed by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Small fragment libraries with insert sizes of 250, 350, 450, and 550 bp were prepared using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Two mate-pair libraries with average insert sizes of 2 and 5 kbp were also built using a Nextera Mate Pair Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Final libraries were quantified using a Qubit and qualities were assessed using a Bioanalyzer. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 using either 2 × 125 bp paired-end or 2 × 150 bp paired-end chemistry at the Genomics and Microarray Core, University of Colorado–Anschutz Medical Campus.2.2. Flow cytometryPrior to sequencing, we conducted flow cytometry to estimate the genome size of R.speciosa. Samples were transferred to the Iowa State University Flow Cytometry Facility and analysed on a BD Biosciences FACSCanto Flow Cytometer using Solanum lycopersicum as an internal standard. All cytometry protocols followed in house methods at that facility. The software package BD FACSDiva v.6.1.319 was used to analyse the data.2.3. De novo nuclear genome assemblyDenovo assembly of the R.speciosa genome into contigs was conducted using MaSuRCA v3.1.0.20 All raw untrimmed sequenced reads were used as input for MaSuRCA as instructed in the manual and run with default settings except the memory usage option (NUM_THREADS and JF_SIZE). Gap closing was conducted via BGI’s GapCloser v1.6 of SOAPdenovo.21 Following this, we used the package SSPACE v2.0 (scaffolding pre-assemblies after contig extension)22 to conduct the final round of scaffolding. Reads trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.3323 (ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:50) were also assembled with SOAPdenovo221 (‘Multi-kmer’ method was used, kmer ranges from 65 to 80) and Abyss v1.9.024 (k = 71, b = 1,000, P = 0.95 and s = 500). Assembly generated by MaSuRCA was used for all downstream analysis as it yielded the best statistics based on scaffold N50. Completeness of genome assembly was evaluated using BUSCO v1.2.252.4. Ploidy estimation and heterozygosity analysisTo estimate ploidy of R.speciosa, we used an approach similar to that employed by Kentaro Yoshida’s group.26 After quality trimming and error correction, reads were mapped backed to the assembled genome using BWA v0.7.1327 with default settings allowing two gaps and without seeding. Samtools was used to convert the sam file containing the alignment information into bam format and the resulting bam file was sorted and indexed.28 SNP calling was conducted using both samtools mpileup and bcftools.28 To reliably calculate base and minor allele frequencies to enable identification of heterozygous alleles, only positions with read coverages = ×50 (approximately one-half of the estimated overall read coverage) and minor allele frequencies = 0.2 were considered. Ploidy is determined by the ratio of alleles at heterozygous positions. In a diploid genome, a ratio of 1:1 is expected for the majority of the heterozygous alleles; in triploid and tetraploid genomes, these ratios should ~1:2 and 1:3, respectively. Using Marker-predicted genes as input, prediction of recent or ancient polyploidization was secondarily tested by plotting the distribution of ages of duplicated sequences using DupPipe.29 Synonymous divergence (Ks) was estimated using PAML v4.9c and the F3X4 model of evolution.30 As polyploidy or whole-genome duplication (WGD) yields a large and enduring signature in such plots, significant features (a = 0.05) in age distributions were identified with SiZer v0.1-4.31 To estimate genome heterozygosity, the number of distinct k-mers in our reads was calculated using Jellyfish v2.2.5.32 k-mers were plotted as frequencies, and the number of peaks was used as an indicator of genome heterozygosity.2.5. Genome annotation with MAKERGenome annotation was conducted using the MAKER-P annotation pipeline and its dependent programmes.33 Two rounds of running the pipeline were completed to yield the final annotation file. Prior to annotation of the protein-coding genes, a R.speciosa-specific repeat library was constructed following the tutorial included in MAKER-P tool kit33 and RepBase v21.09.34 This library served to mask repeat elements in the assembled genome using RepeatMasker v3.2.0.35 The repeat-masked assembled genome of R. speciosa (scaffold length = 1,000 bp) was then processed through the MAKER annotation pipeline. Gene prediction was conducted using SNAP36 and AUGUSTUS v3.2.2,37 trained on Arabidopsis thaliana and S.lycopersicum as models. RNA-seq data obtained from corolla and leaf samples of R. speciosa (Zhuang and Tripp, in rev.; SRA accession: SRP075855) served as EST evidence to refine gene models. High confidence annotation of protein sequences of 31 dicot species were retrieved from the PLAZA database v3.038 to serve as protein evidence for refining gene predictions. The annotation file from the first-round run was used to create the HMM training file for SNAP. The resulting HMM training file together with first-round GFF annotation file were further processed by MAKER-P to generate a final annotation file. Reads generated from previous RNA-seq study (Zhuang and Tripp, in rev.) were mapped against the R. speciosa genome assembly using BWA27 with default parameters. Paired-end reads where each end mapped to gene-containing regions of different scaffolds were then used to combine the fragments of a single gene.39 All predicted protein sequences were further validated following methods described by Upadhyay et al.402.6. SSR identification and maker predicationWe used GMATo (genome-wide microsatellite analysing tool; https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmato/files/)41 to characterize the masked SSR loci. Masked SSR sequences were extracted using an in-house Perl script prior to analysis with GMATo. To enable comparison of our SSR statistics to those reported from other species,42 we employed similar GMATo parameters to those used in prior studies. These included retaining SSR motifs that were 2–8 bp in length and had =4 repeats with a minimum of 10 bp length (-r 5 -m 2 -× 10 -s 0).2.7. Gene Ontology database annotationFunctional annotation of predicted gene models was conducted using the Trinotate pipeline v3.0.0 (http://trinotate.sourceforge.net/), with a blast e-value threshold of 1 × 10-5. To assign function annotations to the predicted genes, local NCBI-BLAST v2.2.3143 was used to search for homologies between the gene and SwissProt,44 UniProt,45 and eggNOG/Gene Ontology (GO) databases.46 In addition, all green plant entries integrated into UniProtKB/TrEMBL (Taxonomy: Viridiplantae)47 were also retrieved to serve as a custom database for blast searches. To enable comparison and visualization of GO annotations in R.speciosa to other plants, the annotated GO terms of Ruellia were combined with GO annotation files of A.thaliana and Solanum tuberosum, which were downloaded from AgriGO (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/dowload).48 This combined file was analysed using BGI WEGO (http://wego.genomics.org.cn)49 to classify GO terms into Level-2 sub categories.2.8. Phylogenetic analysis of genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathwayTo enable phylogenetic investigation of key structural genes involved in the production of anthocyanin pigments that occur in flowers, fruits, and leaves, amino acid sequences representing genes from several angiosperm species were downloaded from PLAZA38 and OrthoDB v9.50 Sequences from Pinus taeda were also download from PINREFSEQ (http://pinegenome.org) to facilitate tree rooting.51 In total, four structural genes from 25 dicots plus three monocots were downloaded then subject to phylogenetic analysis along with orthologues retrieved from R.speciosa and P.taeda (ntax = 30 in total). Based on Trinotate annotation, genes annotated as flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H), and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) were extracted, and CD-HIT52 was used to retrieve non-redundant copies (at a 99% similarity cutoff). To accurately estimate copy numbers of family genes studied, SNPs located within target gene-containing regions identified from polyploidy analysis were further examined; the gene was considered to have unidentified paralogues if the percentage of SNPs were =90% of gene length and averaged =10 reads mapped to the SNP-containing region. We searched for orthologues of these genes in queried plants using the package Proteinortho v5.15.53 Identified sequences were parsed and extracted with an in-house Perl script. Two alignment matrices were constructed: the first containing all F3H, F3'H, and F3'5'H sequences and the second containing all DFR sequences. Sequence alignment was conducted using the ‘linsi’ option of MAFFT v7.305.54 Resulting alignments were truncated to exclude regions of extremely high sequence divergence (namely: autapomorphic divergence), which can interfere with phylogenetic signal owing to phenomena such as long branch attraction.55 Evolutionary histories were inferred using maximum likelihood methods, employing the LG+ F56 amino acid model as the best-fitting model determined by MEGA6,57 and final resulting phylogenetic trees were rooted using P.taeda. Branch support was assessed via 200 ML bootstrap replicates. To test selection on and assess potential functional divergence of duplicated genes, ratios of non-synonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitutions were estimated using the Ka/Ks web service at the computational biology unit, hosted at The University of Bergen.58 Phylogenetic trees from the earlier analyses were used as reference trees for the Ka/Ks analysis.2.9. Genome-wide characterization of MYB3R and R2R3 type MYB gene familyTo characterize the MYB gene family in R.speciosa, protein sequences of 125 typical R2R3-MYB proteins and six atypical MYB proteins (AtMYBCDC5, AtMYB3R-like, and AtMYB4R1) were downloaded from the Arabidopsis information resource (https://www.arabidopsis.org/browse/genefamily/MYB.jsp).59 Three Petunia MYBs regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis were also downloaded from NCBI database (GI:673536265, GI:321688260, GI:321688230) to facilitate function annotation. Proteinortho was used to conduct homologue searches of Arabidopsis MYBs against protein sequence of all gene models annotated by Maker-P with default parameters. Proteins without homologues among Arabidopsis MYBs were removed from subsequent analysis. The resulting MYB proteins were then assessed for the presence of Myb domains using Pfam v26.0 on the Pfam server with default parameters (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk).60 Proteins containing Myb domains were extracted and subjected to phylogenetic analysis using methods as earlier employing the LG + G56 amino acid model as the best-fitting model. Function assignments were conducted based on known functions of Arabidopsis MYBs.61–78 MYBs with bootstrap values = 70% were considered to belong to the same subgroup.2.10. Gene expression analysisTo measure expression levels of selected anthocyanin genes and identified MYBs, reads from previous tissue-specific RNA-seq libraries (Zhuang and Tripp, in rev.; SRA accession: SRP075855) were trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.3323(parameters used: ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36) and mapped back to Maker-P predicted gene sequences using BWA with default parameters. eXpress v1.5.179 was used to measure gene abundance with default parameters. The ‘fpkm’ column of tissue-specific eXpress output was extracted and used for building expression heatmaps using the heatmap.2 program within the gplots80 package for R.2.11. Reference-based chloroplast assemblyWe additionally used resulting reads to assemble the R.speciosa chloroplast genome. First, we retrieved all available plant chloroplast sequences that were 100,000–200,000 bp in size from NCBI. Blat was used to compared our contigs generated from MaSuRCA20 to these reference chloroplast sequences to find nucleotide sequences with high similarity.81 Five contigs (length = 10,000 bp; query coverage = 80%) were identified. We used Blast82 to compare these five contigs against reference chloroplasts and identified two with the highest e-values and query coverages: Lindenbergia philippensis (Accession: HG530133) and Andrographis paniculata (Accession: KF150644). These, together with a chloroplast reference from closed related species Ruellia breedlovei (Accession: KP300014) were used as references for our R. speciosa assembly. Quality trimmed paired-end reads were aligned to the references using Bowtie v2-2.2.3.83 Reads with either end mapped to the references were extracted using Samtools and an in-house Perl script. Mapped reads were randomly subsampled from ×100 to ×500 coverage of the estimated chloroplast genome size; reads with an apparent depth under ×5 were discarded using BBmap v36.02.84 The resulting aligned reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.5.085 and scaffolded using SSPACE v2.022 against all sequenced libraries. Scaffolds were gap closed using Gapcloser v1.6.21 The best assemblies containing three scaffolds = 300 bp were selected and subjected to second-round scaffolding and gap closing, thereby generating a circular chloroplast genome. The chloroplast sequence of the closely related R.breedlovei was used to correct the orientation of the region between the inverted repeats (IRs). CpGAVAS86was used for chloroplast annotation and visualization.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyFrom a whole-genome perspective, the successful sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the R.speciosa genome contributes important new data about one of the largest yet understudied clades of flowering plants—the Asterids. Our targeting Ruellia initiates the process of building a new model system for studies of floral evolution. We herein estimate the genome size of R.speciosa to be ~1.2 Gb based on flow cytometry or ~1.1 Gb based on Kmer analysis (Fig. 2B). For the nuclear genome assembly, nine paired-end libraries with insert sizes ranging from 250 to 550 bp and two mate-pair libraries with insert sizes of 3–6 kbp were constructed. After quality trimming, we generated >118.9 Gb of sequence data representing >×104 coverage of the predicted genome size (Supplementary Table S1). Before scaffolding, short reads were assembled into 808,710 contigs with an N50 of 1,551 bp that totaled 733 Mb (spanning 67.25% of the predicted genome size; Table 1). Additional MP reads improved the N50 by ~10 and the additional gap closing step increased genome coverage to ~90.07% of its predicted size without Ns (Table 1). The success of a draft genome assembly is strongly dependent on the genetic complexity of the specific organism and its genome size.87 Of the two methods we used for genome size estimation, the Kmer protocol estimated a smaller genome size, which may suggest a substantial repeat fraction in the genome that is difficult to account for using this type of analysis.88 Our repeat DNA analysis suggested that ~70% of the genome is repetitive (Table 2). Repeat sequences are difficult to assemble because high-identity reads can derive from different portions of the genome, generating gaps, ambiguities, and collapses in alignment and assembly.89,90 This high repeat DNA content is likely to explain the relatively low scaffold N50 (17,908 bp), even though the sequencing depth exceeds ×100. Nonetheless, our scaffold N50 is comparable to those derived from genome assemblies of Cannabis sativa (N50: 16.7 kb),91,Conyza canadensis (N50: 33.5 kb, repeat content 6.25%),92,Ocimum tenuiflorum (N50: 27.1 kb; repeat content: 42.9%),40,Lemna minor (N50: 23.6 kb, repeat content: 61.5%),93,Solanum commersonii (N50: 44.3 kb, repeat content: 44.5%),4,Hevea brasiliensis (N50: 3 kb, repeat content: 72%),94,Aegilops tauschii (N50: 57.6 kb, repeat content: 66%),95 and Triticum urartu (N50: 63.7 kb, repeat content: 67%).96 Although data from additional sequencing libraries or a combination of existing and additional sequencing technologies may be needed to make further improvements to the quality of the R. speciosa genome for purposes of whole-genome synteny analyses, our current assembly enables us to characterize numerous aspects of this genome ranging from repeat elements, gene content, gene annotation, and phylogenetic history of specific pathways of interest.

Ploidy and heterozygosity of R. speciosaPolyploidization is rampant in flowering plants and is an important contributor to genomic diversity and function; as such, polyploidization can facilitate novel ecological transitions and substantially impact evolutionary trajectories.97 As discussed by Yoshida et al.,26 for diploid species, we expect a single peak at 0.5 for the mean of read counts at heterozygous positions. To characterize the ploidy of R. speciosa, the distribution of read counts of biallelic SNPs was calculated from high coverage genomic regions. Figure 2A depicts a major peak around 0.5, supporting a hypothesis of diploidy in R. speciosa. This ploidy was further confirmed by Ks analysis using DupPipe: peaks of gene duplication serve as evidence of ancient WGDs, but none was identified through Sizer analysis in our Ks plot (Supplementary Fig. S1) thus supporting our earlier conclusion that R. speciosa genome is diploid.Kmer analysis (Fig. 2B) revealed the presence of only a single peak, consistent with our prediction that R.speciosa is highly homozygous. A very minor peak immediately adjacent to the major peak could be detected only when Kmer size  = 31, which represents regions with higher copy numbers such as repeats. To further explore heterozygosity and polymorphism,we calculated the percentage of total insertions/deletions and SNPs using SAMtools and BCFtools.28 We found a total of 2,431,330 SNPs (~0.20%) with relatively relaxed search parameters (depth = 3) or 299,334 SNPs (0.02%) of high confidence (depth = 30), further supporting our hypothesis that the R. speciosa genome is highly homozygous.3.3. Genome annotation and quality assessmentOf the 84,681 scaffolds (length > 1,000 bp) used for gene annotation, 25,256 (29.82%) were found to contain annotated genes. Our final Maker-P33 annotation predicted 40,124 protein-coding genes with an average length of 1,131 bp. This number exceeds the number of genes annotated for two relatively closely related species that have comparable genome sizes: tomato (gene number: 34,727, genome size ~900 Mb)6 and potato (gene number: 35,004, genome size ~844 Mb).7 To assess completeness of our R. speciosa genome assembly, 966 genes present as single-copy orthologues in at least 90% of plant species in OrthoDB were compiled. Using BUSCO, we retrieved orthologues for 741 (77.52%) conserved genes in Ruellia, suggesting a relatively high level of completeness for draft plant genomes generated only from Illumina reads. Additionally, mapping reads from previous RNA-seq experiment on R. speciosa (Zhuang and Tripp, in rev.) back to our genome assembly demonstrated that 76.12% of the quality trimmed reads could be successfully mapped using Tophat298 with default parameters. We interpret this as further evidence of the completeness of our genome assembly given this number is on par with expected mapping rates for RNA-seq data from very well assembled genomes such as the human genome, which has a 70–90% RNA-seq read mapping rate.99Gene annotation databases are commonly used to evaluate functional properties of experimentally derived gene sets.100 Comparison of completed sets of genes from different genomes helps to reveal the genetic basis of biological traits as well as differences among species.101 Using the Trinotate pipeline, we assigned GO functional terms to 30,852 (76.89%) genes. Genome-wide comparative analyses among R. speciosa, S. tuberosum, and A. thaliana revealed distinct patterns of enriched Level 2 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although potato is more closely related to R. speciosa than is Arabidopsis, gene enrichment patterns were more similar between R. speciosa and Arabidopsis than between R. speciosa and S. tuberosum for two of the three categories [cellular component and biological process categories (BP)]. GO terms categorized under molecular function were more consistent among the three species. Across all functions, fewer GO terms were enriched in S. tuberosum compared with in R. speciosa and A. thaliana, with the exception of GO terms involved metabolic processes (BP).3.4. Analysis of repetitive elementsRepetitive DNA elements generally compose the majority of nuclear genomes in plants,102 but this content varies tremendously, ranging from 3% (U.gibba)14 to 80% of the total genome (Triticum aestivum).103 In this study, a combination of homologue-based searching and de novo analyses identified 417,698 (2.47%) tandem repeats in our assembled R. speciosa genome, which can be parsed into 352,081 simple repeats (2.1%), 64,404 low-complexity elements (0.35%), and 1,213 satellite elements (0.02%). Various types of retrotransposons comprising ~25.51% of the whole assembled genome were also recovered in this analysis; these include 29,246 (1.23%) long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE), 276 (1.50e-05%) short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), 424,312 (20.47%) long terminal repeats (LTR), and 113,878 (3.81%) DNA transposons. Overall, using homologue-based and de novo approaches, we estimate that ~70% of the R. speciosa genome is composed of repetitive DNA (Table 2). However, because repeat elements are difficult to assemble, our use of assembly dependent methods for repeat identification may still underestimate total repeat content in the genome. Repetitive sequences possess high sequence homogeneity but, over the course of evolution, accumulate variations in both sequence and copy numbers.104 Because of this, repetitive elements are very useful for markers for many downstream applications, ranging from plant population genetics to breeding studies.105 In particular, molecular makers developed from simple sequence repeats (or microsatellites) have been utilized most extensively as these can be readily amplified by PCR and contain a large amount of allelic variation at each locus.106 We identified 181,793 SSR loci using GMATo. These repetitive elements are depicted via motif type in a frequency distribution plot shown in Fig. 3. The most abundant repeat motifs are AT and TA, together accounting for ~53.37% of the total SSRs identified (Fig. 3A). Dinucleotide repeat motifs were the greatest in number (Fig. 3B), consistent with results from SSR study in holy basil107 but differing from patterns in most other plants including tomato, potato, cucumber, and rice where trinucleotide SSRs represent the majority (not including mononucleotide SSRs)42 of repeat type. Taken together, these data suggest that SSRs constitute a relatively unique and important aspect of the R. speciosa genome.

Analysis of genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathwayFlower colour is among the key traits that serve to signal rewards to pollinators and thus helps determine reproductive success of both plants and pollinators.108–112 The anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (ABP), largely responsible for flower colour, has furthermore been extensively studied for its beneficial contributions to human health.113 Using data from the R.speciosa genome as well as orthologues in other plants with annotated nuclear reference genomes, we reconstructed evolutionary histories of four structural enzymes in the ABP. In R.speciosa, we found two putative copies of F3H, eight of F3'H, one of F3'5'H, and three of DFR. These enzymes were present in variable duplicated copy numbers in other reference genomes as well as in Ruellia (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs S3 and S4; see also ref. 114), although studies in other systems have reported these enzymes as single copy (12 species of Penstemon).114Figure 4Open in new tabDownload slideSummary phylogenies for (A) F3H, F3'H, and F3'5'H and (B) DFR.

Full phylogenetic detail provided in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4.Phylogenetic reconstruction yielded two clades of F3H, three of F3'H, one of F3'5'H, and three of DFR, and strong bootstrap support (=70%) was recovered for some but not all key branches in our topologies (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). Our trees in part contradict those in Campanella et al.,115 which depicted clades of F3'H and DFR that correspond specifically to monocots vs. dicots (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). Instead, Fig. 4 suggests the evolution of different copies of F3H, F3'H, F3'5'H, and DFR predates the divergence of monocots from Eudicots.1 With a given gene genealogy in our analyses (e.g. Fig. 4A), there has been subsequent lineage-specific duplication. Thus, ABP genes are marked by a history of early duplication as well as subsequent duplication events, products of which have in some cases facilitated the evolution of tissue-specific functions.116 Consistent with this, our expression analysis of putative F3'H genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns: among 5 putative F3'H copies with detectable expression levels (fpkm > 1), two copies appeared to be leaf specific and two were corolla specific (Fig. 5). However, Ka/Ks analysis of R.speciosa copies yielded ratios consistently <1, suggesting an overall signature of purifying selection or constraint on these copies (Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S2). Our phylogenetic results also suggest that F3'5'H is more closely related to one of the three clades of F3'H than it is to F3H, corroborating Seitz et al.117 who documented multiple evolutionary origins of F3'5'H from an F3'H ancestor in Asteraceae. F3'5'H is an enzyme required for production of blue delphinidins and, across all land plants, is evolutionarily younger than F3H and F3'H.115 Our finding that only one-half of all reference genomes sampled harbour a copy of this enzyme corroborates observations that blue anthocyanins are less common in plants than are purple, pink, and red cyanidins and pelargonidins that derive from other branches of the ABP pathway. Finally, DFR plays a crucial role in production of all three branches of the ABP pathway and was traditionally thought of as a substrate generalist, having the capacity to metabolize precursors to all three branches.118 However, substrate specificity has evolved in numerous groups of plants, in some cases driven by a single amino acid change.118–121 We recovered three copies of DFR in the R.speciosa genome, each resolved in three separate clades (Fig. 4B). RNA-seq analysis detected expression of two of these three copies: DFR.1 and DFR.3 as labelled in Fig. 4B. Although both copies were expressed in leaf as well as corolla tissue, DFR.1 was up-regulated in leaves (a 2.56-fold increase) whereas DFR.3 was up-regulated in corollas (a 3.50-fold increase) (Fig. 5). In contrast to F3'H copies, Ka/Ks analysis of DFR copies present in R.speciosa yielded ratios > 1 in one of the three copies (Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S3). These data suggest positive selection and are consistent with a hypothesis of adaptive evolution of this copy but functional assays are needed to understand the role of duplicated ABP loci in R.speciosa.

Phylogenetic analysis of MYB gene familyMYB transcription factors, marked by a conserved DNA-binding domain,72 comprise the largest transcription factor family in plants.78 R2R3 type MYBs are specific to the plant kingdom and are involved in the transcriptional control of plant-specific processes.71 Based on homologue searches to known MYB3R and R2R3 type MYBs in A.thaliana, we identified 96 homologous MYBs in the R.speciosa genome then assigned putative functions to 90 of them based on 87 function-annotated MYBs in Arabidopsis (Fig. 7). Our phylogenetic tree is generally consistent with prior data from Arabidopsis alone.66 Among classified MYBs, of particular interest are three subgroups that function in flavonoid biosynthesis (highlighted in blue in Fig. 7), a large pathway that includes the ABP branch. In most species, the anthocyanin branch is controlled by a ternary complex of MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcription factors and the specificity of each function appears to be the result of a particular R2R3-MYB protein that joins the complex.71–73,78 A total of nine Ruellia MYBs (RsMYBs; all highlighted in red in Fig. 7) belonging to two of the three flavonoid subgroups were identified (Fig. 7). Phylogenetic analyses resolved RsMYB71 in the same clade as several flavonoid MYBs from Arabidopsis as well as the R2R3-MYB members anthocyanin2, deep purple, and purple haze of Petunia, which are responsible for full petal colour, flower tube venation/bud-blush, and vegetative pigmentation.122–124 Transcriptome data demonstrated corolla-specific expression of RsMYB71 in Ruellia (Fig. 5), suggesting that this regulatory factor may be a key candidate in regulating flower colour in Ruellia. In contrast, our transcriptome data failed to detect any expression of the remaining eight RsMYBs, all of which belong to a second subgroup (Figs 5 and 7). Comparative analysis of these MYBs across multiple species of Ruellia followed by functional assays are needed to advance knowledge of flavonoid biosynthesis and flower colour production in this group.

De novo assembly of chloroplastChloroplasts are essential photosynthetic organelles of plant cells that manufacture energy in the presence of sunlight.125 Because the chloroplast genome is small, relatively easily sequenced and assembled, and generally uniparentally inherited, this molecule can provide abundant molecular information to support comparative evolutionary research, especially for species without a whole nuclear genome reference available. Furthermore, nucleotide substitution rates of chloroplast are relatively slow and therefore provide an appropriate window of resolution to study plant phylogeny at deep evolutionary time scales.126 In angiosperms, most assembled chloroplast genomes range from 120 to 160 kb in length and exist as circular molecules.127 Employing reference-based assembly methods, a subset of chloroplasts reads were extracted from our whole-genome shotgun dataset and successfully assembled into a circular contig with a length of 148,941 bp. Function and structure annotations conducted using CPGAVAS86 show that the obtained R.speciosa chloroplast genome has a standard quadripartite organization (Fig. 8), comprising two copies of IRs, a large single copy region, and a small single copy region, typical of other plants.125,127,128 In total, five genes involved in photosynthesis and 38 genes involved in self-replication were identified in the R. speciosa chloroplast genome, these with an average intron length of 659 bp (Fig. 8). The whole chloroplast genome assembled in this study will be useful to future phylogenetic research both in Acanthaceae and across angiosperms.

We have contributed a new nuclear genome sequence that serves as only the third family represented by such a sequence within this important clade. By building new genomic resources for R.speciosa, this study facilitates future investigation of Asterid evolution, particular with respect to flower colour production. Additionally, this new resource may facilitate future investigation of the genomic architecture of evolutionary intermediates (sensu Stebbins129), as R.speciosa is member to a clade that demonstrates a clear transition from bee to hummingbird to bat pollination and has features intermediate between the latter two stages.18AvailabilityRaw nucleotide sequence data are available in the NCBI sequence read archive database (BioProject PRJNA326965) under the accession number SRP077633.

IntroductionLegumes produce root nodules as a consequence of a successful interaction with nitrogen-fixing Gram negative bacteria, collectively termed rhizobia. The interaction with bacterial symbionts enables the host plant to utilize atmospheric nitrogen. Therefore, the nodule symbiosis affects agricultural ecosystems. For establishing a symbiotic relationship, host cells guide rhizobia from the infection foci on root hair surfaces into cortical nodule primordia through membranous and tubular paths known as infection threads (ITs), which basipetally develop into infected root hairs and further penetrate into dividing cortical cells. The tip-growth of ITs is correlated with bacterial cell division and file movement.1 Rhizobia endocytically released from ITs into cortical cells and differentiate into bacteroids and can reduce dinitrogen into ammonium ion. Thus, IT progression is important for efficiently establishing the endosymbiosis. IT development has been observed not only in the root nodule symbiosis of legumes but also in the non-legume nodule symbiosis of actinorhizal plants, which are a group of a nitrogen-fixing lineage of angiosperms and interact with nitrogen fixing actinobacteria Frankia.2 The acquisition of nodule symbioses of legumes and actinorhizal plants is suggested to have been independent evolutionary events, further implying advantages of this infection system.In the legume nodule symbiosis, Nod factors, lipochitoligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia, act as initial signals of nodulation.3 The Nod factor perception by host receptors (LjNFR1, LjNFR5, MtNPF, and MtLYS3) triggers the oscillation of perinuclear Ca2+ concentration and root hair deformation to entrap rhizobia.4–10 This Ca2+ spiking requires host factors that are also involved in mycorrhizal symbioses, the so-called common SYMs,11 which are essential for the IT development. The calcium signal is believed to be decoded by LjCCaMK (calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)/MtDMI3 because gain-of-function versions of this protein kinase suppress symbiosis-defective phenotypes observed in the loss-of-function of common SYMs that are required for the Ca2+ spiking.12–15 Transcriptome analyses of actinorhizal plants have revealed that Casuarina glauca, Datisca glomera, and Alnus glutinosa possess common SYM factors including SymRK and CCaMK,16–18 which are involved in the nodule symbiosis of actinorhizal plants.19–21 These findings indicate that common SYM factors also act as signaling components of actinorhizal nodule symbiosis. In addition, a recent study further showed that the C.glauca, homolog of a nodulation-specific legume transcription factor, NODULE INCEPTION (NIN), is involved in the IT development,22–24 implying some nodulation-specific factors commonly required for both types of the nodule symbiosis. Homologous genes among legumes and actinorhizal plants may play a common important role in the development of nodules. Several homologs in a genome (paralogs) are also crucial for the nodulation. The above-mentioned receptors of Nod factors are such kind of paralogous genes and are believed to have originated from gene duplications.25,26 Duplication events in the gene- and genome-levels were suggested to associate with the evolution of symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia.27–29 Possible outcomes of functional divergence of the duplicated genes such as subfunctionalization and neofuntionalization might have adopted a key role in the legume evolution.The above-mentioned L. japonicus and M. truncatula mutants exhibit deficiencies in IT progression and cortical cell division because these factors are responsible for early nodulation signaling pathways. Nodulation includes coordinately regulated processes of IT progression and cortical cell division producing nodule primordia. However, cortical cell division does not always associate with IT progression into the cortex. L. japonicus mutants, cerberus and cyclops, display infection defective phenotypes, but produce nodule primordia. CERBERUS and CYCLOPS encode a U-box protein containing WD-40 repeats and a transcription factor, respectively.30,31 The later protein is targeted by LjCCaMK, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation at critical amino acid residues.32 Similar to L. japonicus mutants, loss-of-functions of M. truncatula counterparts also exhibit infection-deficient phenotype.33,34 These data indicate factors specifically regulating IT progression are conserved in legumes.Many factors regulated with nodulation have been identified to date and have been used to create a basic model of nodulation pathways. Furthermore, common genetic features related with nodulation have been clarified between legumes and actinorhizal plants. However, our knowledge regarding regulatory pathways of IT progression remains fragmented. For elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying rhizobial infection processes, identifying novel factors involved in IT progression is indispensable. For this purpose, we screened L. japonicus mutants exhibiting infection-deficient phenotypes but producing nodule primordia. Here, we report a novel L. japonicus mutant for which infection processes are remarkably affected. Map-based cloning of the mutation locus revealed that the causative gene encodes homolog of M. truncatula ERN1.35–37 Our genomic analysis of ERN in legumes showed a unique feature of ERN genes of L. japonicus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the gene duplication of the ERN gene in the common ancestor of legumes. Molecular evolutionary analysis suggested the difference of functional constraint between the genes of ERN1 and ERN2 lineages after the duplication event.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materialsThe F29 mutant was obtained by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. Approximately 5,000 seeds were immersed in 0.4% EMS overnight and allowed to germinate. M1 plants were grown in a greenhouse, and M2 seeds were collected. A screen for mutants that form nodules but exhibit retarded plant growth was performed in approximately 25,000 M2 plants. A single individual of the M3 self progeny from the M2 candidate mutant was backcrossed with the parent MG-20. The 1699-1 mutant line was produced by carbon-ion beams. Ion-beam irradiation was conducted as previously described.38 The energy of carbon ions was 320 MeV, and the mean linear energy transfer within the seed was estimated to be 86 keV/µm. Approximately 5,000 dry seeds of wild-type (WT) L. japonicus MG-20 were irradiated with carbon ions (C6+) at a dose of 80 Gy. Approximately 84,000 M2 plants derived from approximately 2,900 M1 plants were screened for the nodulation phenotype. The heredity of the mutant candidates was evaluated by segregation in the next generation. The mutants nin-2, cyclops-3, cerberus-5, nsp2-1, and alb1-3 were all derived from L. japonicus Gifu and described previously.22,30,31,392.2. Observation of the rhizobial infectionSeeds were scarified with sandpaper and sterilized with sodium hypochlorite. Sterilized seeds were germinated on 1.0% agar plates under dark condition at 24°C in a growth cabinet (LH-220S, NK System). After 2 days, seedlings were transferred to inoculation pods containing vermiculite supplied with Broughton & Dilworth (B&D) medium,40 10 µM potassium nitrate and Mesorhizobium loti MAFF 303099 constitutively expressing red fluorescent protein (DsRed) gene.41 Plants were grown under 16 h light/8 h dark cycles at 24°C in the growth cabinet. The morphology of each infection events on roots infected with M. loti MAFF 303099 expressing DsRed was observed by a SZX16 microscope (Olympus).2.3. Map-based cloningThe F29 mutant line was crossed with L. japonicus Gifu B-129 for obtaining the F2 population. A total of 1,015 F2 plants were analysed by DNA markers flanking the F29 locus. The DNA markers are detailed below: CM0371I1 is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) marker distinguished by an insertion/deletion. CM0371SN2 is a marker detecting single-nucleotide polymorphism by a sequence analysis. TM0371 is a simple sequence repeat marker. CM0371C1 is a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence digested by MseI. Candidate genes on TAC clone LjT46E19 were predicted by GENSCAN (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html).F2 seeds were scarified with sandpaper and sterilized with 10% hypochlorite. The seeds were maintained in sterile water for water absorption. The seeds were then germinated on 1.0% agar plates for 2 days. Seedlings were transferred to nitrogen-deficient soil and inoculated with M. loti MAFF303099. After 2 weeks, nodules were observed.2.4. Plasmid construction and transformationpCAMBIA1300GFP was constructed detailed below. The HPTII gene was replaced with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and an AscI site was introduced into the SmaI site in pCAMBIA1300 (Cambia). ERN1 promoter region (3,047 bp) and terminator region (1,109 bp) were amplified by PCR using specific primer sets (ERN1 promoter-F, AACTGCAGCGTGCATT GC AC GG ATATAC; ERN1 promoter-R, AAGGCGCGCCCACAAATTG TTCAAATTT AGTAA T  T GAGTG; ERN1 terminator-F, AAGGC GCGC CACTTGATCTT GAAGGTCTTAAGTTAATG; ERN1 ter mi nator-R, TTGAGCTCT GCCTTTGAACTGTGAGCAG). The promoter fragment was digested with PstI and AscI and ligated into pCAMBIA1300GFP. The terminator fragment was ligated into the vector after digesting with AscI and SacI. To utilize Gateway technology, a destination vector named pCGERNGW was then constructed by inserting reading frame cassette A of the Gateway vector conversion system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) into the AscI site treated by the Klenow Fragment (Takara) of the vector. For complementation tests, ERN1 gene amplified twice by PCR (ERN1 gene 1st-F, AAAAAGCAGG CTCCGTGATG GAG AT TCAAT TCCAGCA ;  ERN1 gene 1st-R, AGAAAGCTGGGT TT A A CA GAACAATGA GCACAAGG; ERN1 gene 2nd-F, GGGGACAA G TT T G TACAAAAAAGCAGGCT; ERN1 gene 2nd-R, GGGG AC C ACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT) was cloned into pDONR/ZEO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via Gateway BP reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A binary vector for complementation tests was constructed by introducing the ERN1 gene into pCGERNGW using the Gateway LR reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For promoter analysis, a ß-glucuronidase (GUS)-Plus was amplified from pCAMBIA1305.1 (Cambia) by two times by PCR (GUS Plus gene 1st-F, AA AAAGCAGGCTCCACCATGGTAGATCTGAGGGTAA; GUS Plus gene 1st-R, AGAAAGCTGG GTTCA CACGT GATG GTG AT GG T; GUS Plus gene 2nd-F, GGGGACAA GTTTGTACA AAAA AG C AG GCT; GUS Plus gene 2nd-R, GGGGACCACTTT GTACAAG AAA GCTGGGT). This fragment was then cloned into pDONR/ZEO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via the Gateway BP reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A binary vector for the promoter-GUS analysis was constructed by introducing GUS Plus gene into pCGERNGW using the Gateway LR reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Plasmid constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium rhizogenes AR1193 and transformed into WT, F29, or 1699-1 plants by the hairy root transformation method with minor modifications.422.5. Histochemical GUS staining and quantified reverse transcription-PCRFor histochemical GUS staining, transformed plants with the promoter-GUS construct were inoculated with M. loti MAFF303099. The plants were grown for 7 days after inoculation. Roots were stained with 0.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl ß-d-glucuronic acid cyclohexylammonium salt, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, and 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). For observation of cortical cell division, roots were cleared by a chloral hydrate/glycerol/water (8w/1v/2v) solution.For quantified reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis, plants were grown for 0, 0.5, 1, and 3 days after inoculation with M. loti MAFF303099, and their roots were sampled from them. Total RNA was extracted from roots using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was conducted with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). qRT-PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems) with a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). The following primer sets were used for detection of ERN1 and ATP synthase expressions (ERN1-F,TCCA AT GAAACTCTGTGGGATC; ERN1-R,GGGAAGAAACA TTTGC AG GA; ATP synthase-F, GGTGATAAGCAGAGTGAAAGCA; ATP synthase-R,AAGACCAGTGAGACCAACACG).2.6. Ortholog and synteny analysisThe most recent versions of genome, protein, and complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of each species were downloaded from the respective genome sequence sites as follows: L. japonicus (version 3.0) from the L. japonicus Genome Sequencing Project (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/, November 2016, date last accessed), M. truncatula (Mt4.0v1), and Glycine (Wm82.a2.v1) from Phytozome 11 (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#, November 2016, date last accessed).The analysis of microsynteny across species was based on comparisons of the specific regions containing ERN genes. Based on the LjERN1 and ERN genes in M. truncatula, the ERN genes of L. japonicus and G. max were set as the anchor points according to their physical locations. The protein-coding sequences assigned to the flanking regions of each ERN gene in one species were compared with those in the other species by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for protein databases (BLASTP) program. The reciprocal best hit method was used to define orthologous relationship among the genes in L. japonicus, M. truncatula, and G. max in the same ERN gene region. For the gene conservation among the three ERN gene regions, a BLASTP E-value <1e-20 was considered to be significant.2.7. Phylogenetic analysisSequences similar to LjERN1 were collected with similarity searches against all the 68 plant genomes in the refseq database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using BLASTP on 9 April 2016. The amino acid sequences similar to MtERN1, MtERN2, MtERN3, Sesamum indicum XP_011075059 and XP_011089231, Oryza sativa XP_015645889, and Amborella trichopoda XP_011628828 were selected with the option-max_target_seqs 100. The resulting 213 sequences and three other sequences (LjERN1, Cajanus cajan KYP69442.1, and KYP62096.1) were used for the preliminary analysis. Those containing large indels or those that were highly diverged were omitted from the dataset. Finally, 36 sequences of fabids (eurosid I) were used for the phylogenetic analysis. The amino acid sequences were aligned with the MAFFT program43 using the strategy E-INS-i, followed by manual adjustment. The maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was conducted with the LG model implemented in the RAxML program.44 The best model of evolution was determined using the option –auto-prot = aic in the program. The Bayes method was performed with MrBayes 3.2.6 using a WAG + I+G model.45 Neighbor-Joining (NJ) analysis was conducted with the JTT model of MEGA5.2.2 using the option of partial deletion of site coverage cutoff 80%.462.8. Molecular evolutionary analysisTo examine the pattern of <U+03C9> (dn/ds: nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio) acting on the ERN1 and ERN2 homologs at lineage-specific levels, ML tests implemented in Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) were applied to the 36 sequences.47 The branch-specific model of PAML includes the one-, two-, and three-ratio models to represent the different presumed hypotheses. The one-ratio model assumed a constant ratio <U+03C9> across all branches. The two-ratio models assigned the ratio <U+03C9>ERN1, <U+03C9>ERN2, or <U+03C9>ERN1 + ERN2 to the branches of the ERN1, ERN2, or ERN1 and ERN2 clades, respectively, and the ratio <U+03C9>outgroup to the remaining branches. The three-ratio model assigned the ratios <U+03C9>ERN1, <U+03C9>ERN2, and <U+03C9>outgroup to the corresponding branches. For any pair of models that were nested together, the goodness of fit was tested using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) with the CODEML program in PAML. The branch-site and clade models were also used for the analysis of amino acid sites under positive selection.3. Results3.1. Mutant lines defective in IT progressionDuring the early process of nodulation, rhizobia are entrapped by curled or deformed root hairs to form an infection pocket. From the site as the starting point, they enter into the plant cells through the development of ITs. In L. japonicus, mutants such as alb1, cerberus, crinkle, cyclops, epr3, and nin are shown to be defective in the infection process after the curling.22,30,31,48–50 To identify a new component involved in the infection process, we have performed an extensive screening of symbiotic mutants using L. japonicus. F29, a mutant line of infection processes that does not form effective nodules, was originally isolated by the treatment of EMS to L. japonicus Miyakojima MG-20. On the other hand, the 1699-1 mutant line was isolated through the screening of progeny of ion-beam-mutagenized L. japonicus MG-20 seeds. Both lines did not display a completely non-nodulating phenotype or form an increased number of bump-like structures on the root such as alb1 and epr3 (Fig. 1A).

Upper and bottom panels are bright field images and corresponding fluorescent images. Bars = 0.5 mm.To visualize infection events, we inoculated F29 and 1699-1 mutant lines with Ds-Red-labeled M. loti MAFF303099. The nodulation phenotype of 1699-1 mutants was relatively severe compared with that of F29 mutants. The difference was clearly detected at 10 days after inoculation (DAI), when most of bumps or nodules formed on WT MG-20 roots have already displayed IT progression and release of rhizobia into cortical cells (Fig. 1A and B). Several bumps with IT progression into cortical cells were found in F29 roots although nodule development was remarkably delayed compared with WT nodules (Fig. 1A, C, and D). On the other hand, IT progression into the cortex was not observed in bumps formed on 1699-1 roots at this time point (Fig. 1A and E). Thus, both mutant lines were defective in IT progression into the cortex and nodule development.The mutant lines were mapped near 53 cM chromosome 1, where no known symbiotic gene is located. We, therefore, conducted the allelism test. F1 plants did not form mature nodules, but instead developed many bumps or ineffective nodules in wider range of roots. This result indicates that the two mutant loci are allelic.3.2. Root hair morphology and IT development in two mutant linesMutants that can form bumps but do not produce mature nodules have been reported many times. They have usually shown defects in the infection processes including IT development. Therefore, we evaluated the infection events visualized by DsRed-labeled M. loti. In the WT (MG-20), long ITs were observed in root hairs at 10 DAI (Fig. 2A). The WT mean number was 44.4, and shorter types were only 1.3% of total ITs (Fig. 2C). Frequencies of IT formation in F29 and 1699-1 roots were remarkably lower than WT roots (Fig. 2C). Statistical analysis showed that the numbers of ITs on F29 and 1699-1 roots were 8% and 0.8% of WT roots, respectively. Over 10% of ITs formed in F29 roots were of the shorter type (Fig. 2B and C), indicating that IT development in root hairs was inhibited in mutant lines. These results suggested that the mutated gene is essential for IT development in root hairs and in cortical cells.

In WT roots, curled, branched, and balloon-shaped root hairs comprised major morphological alterations at 4 DAI. Although the mean numbers of branched root hairs were not significantly different between WT and mutant lines, curled root hairs were decreased in mutant roots compared with those of WT roots (Fig. 2A, G, and H). In contrast, the mean numbers of balloon-shaped root hairs were increased in mutant lines (Fig. 2H). These misshapen root hairs expanded to an extreme compared with balloon-shaped root hairs observed in WT roots (Fig. 2D–F), and often generated new tips from lateral sides of the expanded tip (Fig. 2E). Depolarization and repolarization of root hair tips after rhizobial infection may be disorganized in mutant lines. These results indicated that the causative gene of F29 and 1699-1 lines is involved in correct symbiotic root hair responses in addition to IT development.3.3. Complementation by an ERF/AP2 transcription factorTo generate a mapping population, the F29 mutants (Miyakojima MG-20 background) were crossed with L. japonicus Gifu B-129. Fine mapping using the F2 plants allowed us to encompass the causal gene between two makers, TM0371 and CM0371C1, on LjT46E19 of chromosome 1 (http://www.kazusa.or.jp; Fig. 3A). Eleven open reading frames were predicted in this region, and sequence comparison of WT and the F29 mutant revealed a missense mutation from Gly to Glu in the AP2 domain of an AP2/ERF transcription factor with a sequence similar to that of M. truncatula ERN1 (Fig. 3B). The sequence of the AP2/ERF transcription factor of L. japonicus showed high similarity to the M. trancatula ERN1 and other homologs of legumes (Supplementary Table S1). On the other hand, approximately 10 kb of genomic region including this AP2/ERF gene was deleted in the 1699-1 mutant. We then performed a complementation test by hairy roots via A. rhizogenes. For six of eight F29 plants, an ineffective nodule phenotype was rescued by introducing the AP2/ERF gene carrying its 3,047 bp promoter and 1,109 bp terminator (Fig. 3C) but not by introducing a GUS gene (Fig. 3D). Based on the results, we concluded that L. japonicus ERN1 gene is responsible for F29 and 1699-1 mutants. Hereafter, we describe F29 and 1699-1 as Ljern1-5 and Ljern1-6, respectively.

F29 hairy roots transformed with an ERN1 construct (C) and with an GUS vector as a negative control (D) were inoculated with M. loti for 32 days. Upper and bottom panels are bright field images and fluorescent images from a GFP transformation marker, respectively. Bars = 2 mm.3.4. CYCLOPS and NSP2-dependent gene activation of ERN1We then investigated the ERN1 expression pattern in WT in response to M. loti inoculation. The ERN1 gene expressed constitutively in roots, even in the absence of M. loti, and was clearly induced at 12 h after inoculation (Fig. 4). The induction was approximately 3-fold, the transcription levels were maintained at early stages, without being elevated such as the NIN and CLE-RS genes.51 To further explore the spatial expression pattern of ERN1, we constructed a GUS reporter carrying the same promoter and terminator used for the complementation, and transformed to the hairy roots via A. rhizogenes. GUS expression from LjERN1 promoter was detectable for whole uninoculated roots (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, ProERN1::GUS::TerERN1 showed a spatial gradient that the signals were especially high in a developmentally younger region of the root, becoming gradually lower towards the base (Fig. 5A). The root region near the root tip is known to be a susceptible zone for rhizobial infection.52,53 In the root tip region shown in Figure 5C, strong GUS signals were detected in the developing root, root hairs, and a root cap, whereas no signal was detected in the root meristem that undergoes cell division. We then evaluated the expression of ProERN1::GUS::TerERN1 in inoculated roots at 7 DAI. The expression pattern near root tips at 7 DAI was not significantly changed when compared with uninoculated roots (Fig. 5B), whereas the GUS signal was observed on the curled root hair and was more distinct on the dividing cells in the outer cortex (Fig. 5D). These expression patterns are in good agreement with those of M. truncatula ERN1 and ERN2 genes.37LjERN1 expression in nodule primordia resembled that of MtERN1 rather than the other because MtERN2 expression is closely associated with IT progression. On the other hand, regions expressing LjERN1 were broadly expanded within primordia similar to MtERN1. In developing nodules, the GUS signal was restricted to the inside where the infection zone is formed, whereas it was not detected significantly in the peripheral regions of the inoculated root (Fig. 5E).

ERN1 was induced at early stages in nin-2, cerberus-5, and alb-3 mutants, up to the similar levels as the WT. The induction levels of ERN1 in nsp2-1 mutant were almost one-third or one-half that in the WT (Fig. 4). Notably, no induction was observed in the cyclops-3 mutant (Fig. 4). These results indicate a CYCLOPS and NSP2-dependent induction of ERN1 expression.3.5. Syntenic relationship of the genome regions around ERN genes of L. japonicus, M. truncatula and G. maxERN2, an ERF/AP2 transcription factor closely related to ERN1, exists wildly in legumes.54 In M. truncatula, it has been shown to be able to bind to the NF box, and activate ENOD11 transcription36 and to possess similar biological activities with ERN1.54 The double-mutant analyses indicated that ERN1/ERN2 play essential roles for initiating root hair infection and root nodule development.55 Thus, we investigated the ERN2 ortholog in L. japonicus. By searching the latest genome sequences of L. japonicus (Lj_ver3.0) using MtERN2 (Medtr6g029180.1) as query, a top BLASTP hit was obtained against LjERN1 (Lj1g3v3975310.1). The same result was obtained in the tBLASTn search against the transcriptome assembly of L. japonicus.To confirm an orthologus relationship between LjERN1 (Lj1g3v3975310.1) and MtERN1 (Medtr7g085820.1), the syntenic relationships between the genome regions flanking to these genes were analysed. Using a stepwise gene-by-gene reciprocal comparison of the regions, we observed strong conserved microsynteny between these regions (Table 1). As these genome regions correspond to the large synteny block between chromosome 1 of L. japonicus and chromosome 7 of M. truncatula reported by Cannon et al.,56 the synteic relation extended to chromosomal level. Therefore, the orthologous relationship between LjERN1 and MtERN1 was confirmed from the viewpoint of genome synteny. The syntenic relationship surrounding the ERN1 gene was also observed in the corresponding genome regions in G. max (flanking regions of Glyma.16G040000.1 and Glyma.19G113200.1). Syntenic relation in the genome regions of ERN genes of L. japonicus, M. truncatula, and G. maxSyntenic relation in the genome regions of ERN genes of L. japonicus, M. truncatula, and G. maxRegarding the genome region of the ERN2 gene, genes orthologous to MtERN2 were identified in the G. max genome (Glyma.02G072800.1 and Glyma.16G154100.1), and a syntenic relationship between ERN1 and ERN2 genome regions was observed (Table 1). Since the candidate gene orthologous to any of these flanking genes was not identified in L. japonicus genome sequences, the genome region corresponding to the ERN2 gene would probably be deleted in the genome of L. japonicus.3.6. ERN1 and ERN2 clades resulting from gene duplication in legume evolutionWe estimated the phylogenetic tree of ERN genes using all genomic datasets in NCBI RefSeq (Fig. 6). ML, Bayesian inference, and NJ methods estimated essentially similar tree topologies (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The estimated trees strongly suggested that a gene duplication event produced the ERN1 and ERN2 clades after the divergence of legume plants in Fabales from the others (rosid I)57. It should be noted that LjERN1 of L. japonicus is included in the ERN1 clade. All the genome-analysed legume species harbored both the ERN1 and ERN2 genes except for L. japonicus.

Difference of functional constraint between ERN1 and ERN2 genesThe phylogenetic tree shape of the ERN genes suggests divergence of evolutionary rates between the ERN1 and ERN2 genes (Fig. 6); the branches in the ERN2 clade are longer (i.e. more substitutions per site) than those in the ERN1 clade. In general, variations in substitution rates can be due to different nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (<U+03C9> = dn/ds).27,58–60 The branch model of PAML was adopted to consider different <U+03C9> in the tree and five following models were compared: (i) one ratio across the tree; (ii) two different ratios between the ERN1 clade and the other parts; (iii) two different ratios between the ERN2 clade and the other parts; (iv) two different ratios between the ERN1/ERN2 clade and the other parts; and (v) three different ratios between the ERN1, ERN2 clade, and the other parts (Table 2).47,61 The LRT was conducted to compare nested models and showed no significant likelihood differences between the models 1 and 2 and between 3 and 5. On the other hand, the tests rejected the null hypotheses for all other combinations (Table 2) and Akaike's and Bayesian information criteria favored the model 3. These results suggested that the <U+03C9> of the genes in the ERN2 clade is greater than the background ratio and that <U+03C9> of the genes in the ERN1 clade is almost identical to that of the genes of nonlegumes. The clade model of PAML also showed similar results (Supplementary Table S2). No positively selected site was not detected in the ERN2 genes with branch-site and clade models (Supplementary Table S2).

DiscussionPhenotypic analyses of L. japonicus ern1 mutants showed that this gene is essential for symbiotic root hair responses and IT development. Although Ljern1 mutants produced nodule primordia equivalently to the WT, its development was restricted (Fig. 1). Nodule primordia formed in Ljern1 mutants did not develop ITs into cortical cells (Fig. 1). Thus, the defect in IT development is a major Ljern1 phenotype. This symbiotic phenotype of Ljern1 mutants appeared to be intermediate between the M. truncatula ern1 single and ern1/erm2 double mutants. Mtern1 produces a limited number of ITs from infection foci on root hairs. These ITs are arrested within root hairs and do not progress into nodule primordia.35 Similar to the M. truncatula counterpart, IT formation was remarkably downregulated in Ljern1 mutants (Fig. 2). Regarding the defect in IT development and production of nodule primordia, the Ljern1 phenotype resembles that of the Mtern1 single mutant rather than the ern1/ern2 double mutant, which exhibits a more severe phenotype than respective single mutants. The double mutant does not produce ITs and nodule primordia,55 suggesting the implication of ERN transcription factors in nodule organogenesis. Alternatively, cortical cells may not be stimulated due to loss of infection events (infection pockets and ITs) in the root epidermis of the double mutant. Host loss-of-function symbiotic mutants able to produce nodule primordia without any infection events in the epidermis have not been identified so far.The loss-of-infection events in the double mutant are partially explained by aberrant symbiotic root hair responses. Unlike Mtern1, root hairs of the double mutants are unable to entrap rhizobia because of a defect in tip curling.55 Root hair tips of the double mutants are abnormally expanded, suggesting that its polarity is deregulated. Similar abnormality was observed in Ljern1 single mutants after inoculation with rhizobia (Fig. 2). The number of curled root hairs was decreased, and balloon-shaped root hairs were increased in the mutant, indicating that LjERN1 is involved in symbiotic root hair responses besides IT development. Thus, the root hair phenotype of Ljern1 includes the feature characteristic to ern1/ern2 double mutants in M. truncatula, which is compatible with the absence of ERN2 in L. japonicus. However, the Ljern1 phenotype is weaker than that of the M. truncatula double mutants. Other factor may partially compensate the loss of ERN function during early symbiotic root hair responses in L. japonicus.GUS reporter analysis reveals gradients of LjERN1 expression across uninfected primary roots, namely high expression levels within root tip regions of the roots, whereas levels are lower towards the base. As the root tip region is susceptible to rhizobial infection,52 this expression gradient is believed to represent an infection potential of rhizobia; in other words, the distribution of infectable root cells. When M. loti was inoculated, the expression of ProERN1::GUS::TerERN1 was observed only in root hair cells undergoing rhizobial infection (via IT development) and in cortical cells initiating cell division (Fig. 5). On the other hand, ERN1 expression was suppressed in the peripheral epidermal regions where few infection events occurred. These findings suggest that ERN1 expression patterns are in good agreement with rhizobial infection potential and infection events. Strong expression of ERN1 is also distinct in dividing cortical cells. Within this interpretation, two possibilities are conceivable: (i) ERN1 is directly involved in cortical cell division; and (ii) ERN1 expression confers the ability to accept ITs to dividing cortical cells. In the former case, ERN1 is unlikely to be involved in universal cell division because no expression was found in root meristem where cell division is always active (Fig. 5). In the latter case, ERN1 expression may be involved in the navigation of developing ITs to cortical cells. Further analysis will be required to clarify what kinds of functions ERN1 has in dividing cortical cells.Quantitative expression analysis using symbiotic mutants shows that the early induction of ERN1 by M. loti inoculation is required for CYCLOPS and partially for NSP2. Recently, Cerri et al.55 clearly showed that NSP2 in the presence of NSP1 can act as a strong activator of ERN1 transcription in transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana, and our data are consistent with their results regarding NSP2. On the other hand, ERN1 induction was clearly canceled in the cyclops mutant background. Although CYCLOPS was originally identified as a component of the common symbiosis pathway that directly interacts with CCaMK, it has been demonstrated that it acts as a transcription activator of the NIN gene via direct binding of CYCLOPS-box in its promoter region. Since NIN is required for early infection events via IT development and its target NF-YA1 directly binds with MtERN1 promoter,62,,63 it is possible that ERN1 acts downstream of NIN to regulate IT progression. However, our results show that ERN1 is normally induced in response to the inoculation of M. loti in the nin mutant background similar to the WT, indicating that ERN1 activation is not controlled by NIN. NIN is likely to act parallel with ERN1 under the control of CYLOPS or may act downstream of ERN1. The balloon-shaped root hair phenotype characteristic to Ljern1 mutants has not been reported in nin mutants, which display excess curled and branched root hairs in response to rhizobial infection. The frequency of branched root hairs in Ljern1 mutants was equivalent to that of the WT. The different root hair morphology may suggest that ERN1 and NIN play distinct roles to positively regulate root hair responses and IT progression. In any case, the elucidation of transcription networks involving CYCLOPS, ERN1, and NIN is a future challenge.The phylogenetic analyses showed that ERN1 and ERN2 genes were originated from the gene duplication after the divergence of Fabales. The duplication event and subsequent molecular evolution of the genes might associate with the evolution of nodulation symbiosis of legume plants although we do not know the full details of the evolutionary history of ERN genes because of the lack of information for plants other than symbiotic legumes of Faboideae (Fabaceae) in Fabales (e.g. Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, Quillajaceae, Polygalaceae, and Surianaceae). The comparative genomic analysis of the synteny of ERN genes showed that ERN1 of legumes had a similar gene order to the ERN genes of nonlegume plants, rather than that of ERN2 did. In contrast to the previous suggestion that ERN1 was derived from ERN2 via duplication,54,55,64 the synteny analysis proposed that ERN1 might have an orthologous role to ERN genes of plants of the outgroup. Molecular evolutionary analysis of <U+03C9> ratio supported this result. The LRT failed to reject the alternative hypothesis of different <U+03C9> ratio between ERN1 and all other genes in the phylogeny of Figure 6 against the null hypothesis of the same <U+03C9> ratios of all genes (Table 2). The test also showed that the <U+03C9> ratio of ERN2 was significantly greater than the background ratio of ERN1 and other ERN genes. It has been believed that variable nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios among lineages may associate with the difference of functional constraint along certain lineages.65,66 According to this proposition, the functional constraint appears to be conserved between legume ERN1 and nonlegume ERN genes, whereas the genes in the ERN2 lineage may have suffered relaxed selective constraints. It is possible that ERN1 took over the main molecular function of original ERN genes and that ERN2 has subfunctionalized and/or neofunctionalized the ERN function, and is a helpful adjunct to the ERN1 gene during nodulation. A recent article appears to support this proposition.55 Although the ern1 mutants of M. truncatula were unable to nodulate, ern2 mutants can nodulate but with signs of premature senescence. Although the ern1 mutant still exhibited early symbiotic responses including rhizobial infection, ern1/ern2 double mutants were completely unable to initiate infection and nodule development. ERN2 showed partially overlapping expression patterns with ERN1.55Our genomic analysis suggested the possibility of a lack of the ERN2 gene in the genome of L.japonicus. LjERN1 might have a sufficient role in IT development of L. japonicus. Alternatively, the function and expression of the LjERN1 may be complement in those of ERN2 genes of other legumes. This notion is consistent with the fact that Ljern1 single mutants display balloon-shaped root hairs that are observed in only ern1/ern2 double mutants in M. truncatula.This work was supported by a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (to K.Y.; 22·3459), Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research from JSPS (Grant Number 26660057), the Canon foundation (to W.I.), The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology KAKENHI Grant Number 16H06279 (to W.I.), and Grant for Basic Science Research Projects 150574 from the Sumitomo Foundation (to T.S.).

IntroductionThe response of sessile lifeforms like plants to environmental alterations like heat stress (HS) is dependent on a complex network of distinct and interconnected pathways to maintain protein homeostasis and minimize cellular damage. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are examples for HS-induced genes in various plant species,1–6 which contribute to thermotolerance as shown by genetic studies.7–10 The majority of these HS-induced genes are under the control of HS transcription factors (Hsfs). Although metazoans and fungi contain only one, plant genomes code for a large repertoire of Hsfs, which are of major importance due to their ability to rapidly activate the transcription of essential genes for stress response and survival.11In addition to transcriptional changes, pre-mRNA alternative splicing (AS) is another important mechanism involved in heat stress response (HSR).12 Splicing is a central process for pre-mRNA maturation of intron-containing genes in all eukaryotic organisms.13,14 In response to environmental or developmental stimuli, AS of a single pre-mRNA can lead to various transcripts that may code for different functional protein variants.15 AS is a key mechanism for eukaryotes to increase proteome diversity from a defined number of pre-mRNAs.16,17 Consequently, AS is a common regulatory mechanism and the enhanced transcriptome diversity is required for stress adaptation18 and definition of plant tissue identity.19 In line, in plants about 61% of multi-exon genes are alternative spliced.20At stage, at least four different modes of AS are annotated as intron retention (IR), exon skipping (ES), alternative acceptor (AA) and alternative donor (AD) site splicing.20 IR occurs when an intron is not removed from the pre-mRNA and remains in the mature mRNA. ES describes the event where an exon is spliced out of the pre-mRNA and AA and AD describe the usage of alternative 3' and 5' splice sites by the spliceosome, respectively.21 The various modes of AS can lead to premature termination codons (PTCs) resulting either in degradation of the mRNA through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway or translation of a truncated protein.22,23 In addition, AS can result in changes or complete removal of functional domains, which may lead to proteins with novel functions.24 The prevalent AS event in Arabidopsis thaliana is IR that leads to PTCs.25,26Therefore, the analysis of genome-wide AS especially in crop plants is of major interest to describe the mechanisms involved in stress response27 and pollen development.28 Based on this, we analysed the transcriptome of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) pollen as model for a reduced tissue (two or three celled structure)29. Pollen development is characterized by a remarkable sensitivity to high temperatures.30,31 For example, plants exposed to HS show decreased pollen viability,32 which can cause sterility and in an agricultural aspect lead to crop damage.33We used pollen from two different tomato cultivars, namely Moneymaker and Red Setter to analyse the changes induced by AS in response to HS using RNA-seq datasets. The application of two cultivars enabled us to exclude genotype specific AS and focus on HS induced AS. We focused on changes induced by IR, ES, AA and AD. Additionally, HS-dependent accumulation and reduction of AS events in specific genes was observed and these genes used to identify biological processes affected by AS under HS. In the end, transcriptome assembly led to the identification of 141 HS-specific and 22 HS-repressed transcripts. HS-specific and repressed putative protein isoforms were analysed concerning length differences in general and functional changes due to loss, gain or change of functional domains. We observed transcripts with steady expression levels under control conditions and HS showing a clear difference in the occurrence of specific isoforms partially or completely lacking functional domains. The latter exemplifies that post transcriptional AS leads to synthesis of transcripts putatively encoding for alternative protein isoforms, which might be required for HSR.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material, stress treatment and pollen analysisTomato plants (S.lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker and Red Setter) were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions (24 °C/18 °C, day/night temperature; 60% humidity). Eight-week old flowering plants were transferred to a climate chamber and exposed to a 39°C HS treatment for 1 h and then allowed to recover till anthesis. Flowers that received the stress 9–12 days before anthesis, corresponding to pollen meiosis and tetrads stages of development were analysed for pollen viability and number as previously described.34 In total 15–20 plants were used for the analysis for each genotype and treatment, and the experiment was repeated three independent times.For RNAseq analysis flowering plants received the same treatment and buds were collected directly after HS or allowed to recover for 1.5 h at 24 °C. Untreated/control plants were kept at 24°C for the same time. Anthers from four flower buds were sampled in 500 µl of germination solution (2 mM boric acid, 2 mM calcium nitrate, 2 mM magnesium sulphate, 1 mM potassium nitrate) and squeezed open with slight mechanical stress, vortexed and filtered through muslin cloth. The collected pollen grains were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pelleted pollen were washed in 200 µl germination solution and centrifuged at 1,000× g for 1 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated a couple of times to remove the unwanted material. In total, more than 100 flower buds were used for pollen isolation. Purity of pollen was inspected under a light microscope. After isolation of pollen, all developmental pollen stages (microspore mother cell, tetrads, microspores and mature pollen) were pooled together for each of the four conditions: cv. Moneymaker-CO, cv. Moneymaker-HS, cv. Red Setter-CO and cv. Red Setter-HS. For each condition, two biological replicates were used for RNA-seq analysis, and another three independent biological replicates were used for qPCR analysis.2.2. RNA isolation and mRNA sequencingTotal RNA was extracted from pollen of all eight samples using the E.Z.N.A. Plant RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). Total RNA was used for the preparation of mRNA-seq libraries (GenXPro GmbH, Frankfurt Main, Germany) by performing rRNA depletion and enrichment of mRNA via polyadenylation (polyA) selection and purification.35 Constructed libraries from each replicate of cv. Moneymaker and cv. Red Setter were strand-specific sequenced (paired-end) with a read length of 135 bases on a HiSeq2500 (GenXPro GmbH, Frankfurt Main). The mRNA-seq datasets discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE80556 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80556).2.3. Read alignment and identification of AS eventsThe eight FASTQ files were aligned in paired-end mode to the S. lycopersicum genome (version ITAG2.4, cv. Heinz) available from the Sol Genomics Network.36 The alignment of the RNA-seq reads onto the reference genome was done via TopHat2 (version 2.0.13)37 using the following alterations of default parameters: –max-multihits 1; –min-intron-length 36; –max-intron-length 50,000; –mate-inner-dist 300; –mate-std-dev 100. The parameters were chosen due to the fact that the wild form of tomato Solanumpimpinellifolium has only a nucleotide divergence of 0.6%38 and by this our cultivars should have no more divergence.Next, the Pearson correlation coefficient of read counts was computed pairwise between all samples based on computed read counts of all genes. Read counts were obtained by counting the number of reads (NuR) aligned on a specific gene. Due to the high correlation (>0.99) and small biological variation between biological replicates, the TopHat2 alignments of biological replicates were merged into a single alignment file resulting in four final alignment files (Moneymaker CO, Moneymaker HS, Red Setter CO and Red Setter HS).Next, TopHat2 alignments were used for the identification of AS events, namely IR, ES, AA and AD. For this purpose, the coordinates of all annotated introns and exons were extracted from the ITAG2.4 corresponding Generic feature format version 3 (GFF3) file of S. lycopersicum. Introns were assumed to be retained (IR) if all positions of the intron were covered by at least one read. The other three exon specific events (ES, AA and AD) were considered to be present if the NuR witnessing the particular event exceeded the average genome coverage per position of each library.2.4. FPKM calculation and verificationAs cDNA fragments were sequenced from both ends (paired-end reads), quantification was done by counting paired reads as one fragment. Assignment of fragments was preceded to annotated exons of gene models (gene fragments). The assignment of fragment counts was performed with htseq-count of the High-Throughput Sequencing python framework (HTSeq).39 Afterwards, for each gene the number of gene fragments was normalized by the size of the library and the length of all exons within the gene. Finally, multiplication by one billion (to counteract the division by kilobase and by million mapped reads) resulted in FPKM (fragments per kilo base of exon per million fragments mapped) values for genes.FPKM calculation was verified by qRT-PCR. cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 µg of total RNA using the Revert Aid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The expression of selected genes was investigated by real-time PCR on a Stratagene Mx3000P cycler (Agilent Technologies). The qRT-PCR reaction (10 µl) included gene specific primers (Supplementary Materials S1), PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix Low ROX™ (Quanta Biosciencies) and the appropriate cDNA template. Thermal cycling conditions were 95°C/3 min followed by 95°C/15 s, 60°C/30 s, 72°C/30 s for 40 cycles. Gene primers (Supplementary Materials S1) were designed using PRIMER3 (http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3.cgi/; September 2016). Data were analysed by standard methods40 and presented as relative levels of gene expression using ubiquitin (UBI; Solyc07g064130) and EF1a (Solyc06g005060) genes as internal standards. Each qRT-PCR reaction was repeated three times on the basis of three independent biological replicates. The RNA used for qRT-PCR analysis was independent from the RNA used for RNA-seq.2.5. Detection of HS-dependent IR and ES eventsAfterwards, genes were discriminated by this in sets of (I) HS-dependent accumulation of AS and (II) HS-dependent reduction of AS. Regarding the first set (I), IR and ES events of the upper 5% quantiles of the log2 fold change distributions and exclusively occurring under HS were determined. In the next step IR and ES events were assigned to genes. Finally, only genes showing HS-dependent accumulation of at least one common AS event (IR or ES) in both cultivars were extracted. Regarding the second set (II), in a similar approach genes showing HS-dependent reduction of AS were identified by extracting those IR and ES events of the lower 5% quantile and those exclusively present under CO.2.6. Gene set enrichment analysisGene ontology (GO)41 terms were assigned to all annotated genes (ITAG 2.4) via InterProScan (version 5.14-53.0).42 Next, genes alternatively spliced under HS and CO conditions were analysed for enrichment of GO terms related to the biological process category. The enrichment analysis was performed with the Cytoscape (version 3.2.1)43 plugin BiNGO (version 3.0.3)44 by using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction45 and applying an adjusted P-value cut-off of 0.01 as threshold. In addition, visual inspection of enriched GO terms was performed to exclude unspecific terms (Supplementary Materials S2; bold terms). Terms were excluded if their function could be more precisely defined by a child-term (e.g. transport and intracellular transport).2.7. HS-dependent transcript assemblyAll mapped reads located in a range from 1 kilobase pair (kbp) downstream to 1 kbp upstream of genes showing HS-dependent accumulation or reduction of AS were extracted from TopHat2 Sequence Alignment/Map files of all four runs and used as input for reference based transcript assembly via Cufflinks (version 2.2.1).46 Cufflinks was executed with default parameters except for the following modifications: –min-isoform-fraction 0.05; –pre-mRNA-fraction 0.05; –small-anchor-fraction 0.05.Transcripts assembled by Cufflinks were afterwards assigned to annotated tomato genes of the ITAG2.4 and renamed concerning the identifier (e.g. SolycXXgYYYYYY) of the gene. Next, all transcripts assigned to the same gene identifier were compared between HS and CO condition and those present only under HS for both cultivars determined as HS-specific transcripts and those only present under CO for both cultivars as HS-repressed transcripts. Transcripts were assumed to be similar if all underlying exon coordinates were identical except for the start coordinate of the first and the end coordinate of the last exon as such differences are expected to lead to alternative untranslated regions (UTRs) without an effect on the coding sequence (CDS).2.8. Identification of AS events in HS-specific and repressed transcriptsHS-specific and -repressed transcripts were compared with the transcripts annotated in the GFF3 of the ITAG2.4. In a first step, transcripts, whose exterior exons were not overlapping the exterior exons of the ITAG2.4 (inconsistent length) were excluded. In a second step, transcripts covering more than one annotated tomato gene (multisolyc transcripts) or containing no stop codon (transcripts with no CDS) were excluded. Next, the remaining transcripts were sub-divided into five groups based on the presence and absence of AS events: transcripts with only IR (i, only IR), transcripts with only ES (ii, only ES), transcripts with mixtures of IR and ES (iii, IR + ES), transcripts with other events than only IR and ES like AA and AD events as well as not annotated introns and exons (iv, others) and transcripts showing no difference in their splicing pattern to the ITAG2.4 annotation (v, perfectly).2.9. Confirmation of HS-specific isoforms via RT-PCRTranscripts assembled via Cufflinks and TopHat2 based on RNA-seq data were verified via RT-PCR. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with Revert Aid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Splicing of selected genes was monitored by RT-PCR using specific primers (Supplementary Materials S1). Four transcripts were chosen, one serves as control with no AS isoform in all four samples (Solyc08g068350). The other three transcripts contain HS-specific IR (Solyc09g074680), ES (Solyc03g121800) or both (Solyc10g084400) in the HS datasets.2.10. Functional domain analysisAs a first step, the CDS within the HS-specific and repressed transcripts was determined. The CDS search was performed by taking the start codon annotated in the ITAG2.4 as starting point and searching for the first stop codon (TAA, TAG or TGA). The obtained CDSs of all transcripts were then translated into protein sequences and together with the corresponding annotated protein sequences of tomato ITAG2.4 analysed for functional domains. For domain detection the protein families database (PFAM)47 and HMMER348 were used executing hmmscan with default parameters. After that, the predicted domains were compared between the predicted and annotated proteins to identify gain, loss and changes in the domain architecture.2.11. Large datasetsThe mRNA-seq datasets discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus49 and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE80556 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80556). Sixteen paired-end fastq files for eight samples are deposited. These eight samples are from tow tomato cultivars (Moneymaker and Red Setter) and treated with HS (39 °C) or under control conditions (25 °C) in two replicates each.3. Results3.1. AS events in tomato pollen in response to HSTo analyse the effect of HS on the transcriptional fate of tomato pollen, total RNA of pooled developmental stages of pollen was extracted from Moneymaker and Red Setter tomato plants. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the short (1 h) HS at 39°C did not affect the viability of Moneymaker pollen but caused a 21% reduction in Red Setter (Supplementary Materials S3). The analysis was done for the earlier developmental stages, which are considered as more sensitive to elevated temperatures. Subsequently, the selection of these two cultivars allowed us to analyse changes occurring in two genotypes with slight pollen thermotolerance differences. In a similar manner, for genome-wide transcriptome analysis, flowering plants were exposed to 39 °C for 1 h and pollen was isolated directly after the treatment as well as after recovery of flowers at 25 °C for 1.5 h. Both pollen samples were combined. By this way we were able to monitor the AS events occurring during HS and during the recovery from HS, as both represent important phases of stress response with distinct transcriptional signatures.50 To analyse the HSR, pollen from plants kept at 25 °C were isolated and analysed. This sample is annotated as control (CO).RNA-seq libraries from two biological replicates were constructed for HS and CO conditions for both cultivars. After sequencing, all libraries were aligned to the tomato genome of cultivar Heinz with the spliced aligner TopHat2.37 In contrast to de novo or reference based transcriptome assembly,35 the alignment to a reference genome allows the expression analysis and the detection of AS events for annotated genes. A high Pearson correlation between the read counts of biological replicates (Supplementary Materials S4), allowed us to merge their alignments into a single file leading to four samples to be analysed (Moneymaker CO, Moneymaker HS, Red Setter CO and Red Setter HS) with a total amount of more than 280 million reads each (Table 1). The rate of read alignment slightly differed between the four libraries ranging from 42% for Moneymaker-CO to 61% for Red Setter-HS. Reads witnessing an IR, ES, AA or AD event were traced in the alignment files.  Statistics of mRNA-Seq librariesGiven is the total number of reads (NuR), of aligned reads (AR) and the percentage ARs (%) for Moneymaker and Red Setter HS and CO libraries. Statistics of mRNA-Seq librariesGiven is the total number of reads (NuR), of aligned reads (AR) and the percentage ARs (%) for Moneymaker and Red Setter HS and CO libraries.We compared the alignment position with the exon-intron structures of the gene annotation in the S.lycopersicum cv. Heinz genome (ITAG2.4; http://solgenomics.net/; cv. Heinz 1706) (Fig. 1A). An IR was assumed to be present if the respective intron was covered at each position by at least one read. An ES was assigned if a read was aligned to two exons excluding another exon or even more exons in between. In the same line, we annotated an AA and AD in case that a read was aligned to two exons, but either the donor or acceptor site differed from that deposited one in the database. An ES, AD and AA event was considered significant when the NuR witnessing the AS event exceeded the average genome coverage of the library.

(B and C) representing the number of genes showing particular AS events (IR, ES, AA and AD) under CO, HS or both conditions (Overlap) for the cultivars Moneymaker (B) and Red Setter (C).For each of the four AS events the number of genes showing this particular event was determined, where multiple occurrences of the event in a single gene were counted only once. The number of genes with a particular IR and ES event is clearly different between the CO and HS conditions. We observed 8,415 genes with IR under HS, and 4,578 genes with IR under CO in Moneymaker (Fig. 1B). About 87% of the genes with IR found at CO also showed an IR under HS (Fig. 1B, grey bar). In Red Setter we observed only a slight increase of genes with IR at HS (8,795 genes) when compared with CO (8,394 genes), while the total number of genes with IR under HS conditions is rather comparable in both cultivars. We realized that IR is by far the most common AS event (Fig. 1B and C). Furthermore, an increase of genes with ES from 684/612 under CO to 1,225/901 genes under HS was observed in Moneymaker and Red Setter, respectively. In contrast the number of genes with AA and AD did not increase upon HS in the two cultivars. Remarkably, 54 and 61% of all genes with ES under CO and HS occur in both cultivars. Further, 81/89% of all genes with IR in Moneymaker were also present in Red Setter under control or HS conditions. These findings demonstrate that AS is a general temperature-dependent response, while cultivar-specific AS exists depending on the AS event and condition (Supplementary Materials S5).3.2. HS-dependent IR and ES events in tomato pollenThe increase of genes with IR and ES events in tomato pollen upon HS might indicate heat-sensitive IR and ES. Next, we checked whether the different AS events are related with the abundance of expression of the respective genes. For this purpose we determined the FPKM normalized expression of all genes and categorized them with respect to their AS behavior, meaning AS under both, one or none of the conditions (Supplementary Materials S6). In total, 23,868 (Moneymaker) and 25,314 (Red Setter) genes showed an FPKM > 1 in both conditions (CO and HS), respectively. For the majority of these genes (58.7 and 56.8%) we did not identify reads that would indicate AS events. In turn, for 22.3 and 28.8% of all genes reads were identified, which suggest the existence of alternatively spliced transcripts under both conditions in Moneymaker and Red Setter, respectively. Differences between cultivars were observed for genes showing AS under a single condition. For Moneymaker we found with 15.7% a five times higher amount of genes with alternatively spliced transcripts under HS compared with CO (3.25%). For Red Setter we realized nearly similar amounts of alternatively spliced transcripts under HS (7.6%) and CO (6.7%). Notably, the identification of AS was not dependent on FPKM expression of a certain gene (Supplementary Materials S6). For verification of FPKM expression levels, these were correlated with expression levels obtained from qPCR. Results revealed for both Moneymaker and Red Setter correlation higher than 0.97 (Supplementary Materials S7). Furthermore, we aimed to rule out a potential dependency of detected IR events on the number of introns comprised in a gene. Therefore, genes were examined for their intron density and the amount of retained introns (Supplementary Materials S8). Although a small number of individual genes showed a higher degree of retained introns with up to 12 IR events (Supplementary Materials S8, white scatter plot), the general tendency revealed an accumulation of IR between zero and three IR events. This observation was irrespective of the number of introns contained in a gene, where Moneymaker CO showed the lowest abundance with the majority of genes having only up to one IR event (Supplementary Materials S8, contour plot). In addition, we compared these observations to a model supporting a dependency between the amount of IR events and the number of introns in a gene (Supplementary Materials S8, red scatter plot), but no relationship could be detected. These results confirm that detection of AS is neither dependent on the expression of the underlying gene nor on the composition of the gene and by this shows that AS is a controlled mechanism and no side effect.Consequently, we aimed to quantify the alteration of IR and ES between the two conditions at intron and exon resolution, respectively. For this purpose, the IR frequency of each intron and the ES frequency of each exon were normalized to the library size and the expression of the underlying gene (Formula 1). The log2 value of the normalized frequency under HS divided by the normalized frequency under CO serves as a measure of HS-dependent accumulation (positive log2 ratio) or reduction (negative log2 ratio) for IR and ES (Fig. 2A and B). Interestingly, the fold change distribution of IR (light and dark blue) and ES frequency (light and dark orange) for both cultivars represents a normal distribution. In total, 4,331/8,275 IR and 553/618 ES events could be detected in both conditions for Moneymaker (light color) and Red Setter (dark color), respectively. Thus, we defined for each cultivar the IR and ES events of the upper (accumulation) and lower (reduction) 5% quantile of the respective IR and ES distribution as HS-dependent (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, 10,882 and 7,334 IR events as well as 1,178 and 735 ES events solely occur under HS in Moneymaker or Red Setter, respectively (Fig. 2C). These events were added to the respective set of IR and ES events accumulating under HS (in total: 11,099 IR events in Moneymaker and 7,748 IR events in Red Setter; 1,206 ES events in Moneymaker and 766 ES events in Red Setter). Similarly, the 1,625/5,224 IR and 309/243 ES events exclusively found under CO condition in Moneymaker or Red Setter were added to the respective set of IR and ES events reduced under HS (in total: 1,842 IR events in Moneymaker and 5,638 IR events in Red Setter; 337 ES events in Moneymaker and 274 ES events in Red Setter). This demonstrates that induction of AS events like IR and ES is a more abundant regulatory mode in HSR than the reduction of AS events, irrespective of the cultivar analysed.

Processes affected by HS-dependent IR and ES events in tomato pollenAfter the global analysis of splicing events we aimed at the definition of the global network of genes regulated by AS under HS irrespective of genotype specificities. Thus, we searched for genes regulated by the same type of AS event (IR or ES) in both cultivars under HS or CO conditions, respectively. To this end, we collected all genes for which at least one IR or ES event shows HS-dependent accumulation or HS-dependent reduction and determined the overlap between both cultivars. Approximately 7,500 genes with HS-dependent accumulation of IR and ES were detected (Fig. 3A). For ~3,400 genes at least one IR or one ES event occurred in both cultivars (Fig. 3A; white numerals). The majority of these genes (2,731) contained only IR events in both cultivars. HS-dependent reduction of IR and/or ES was found in 4,846 genes (Fig. 3B). Most genes contained an IR solely in Red Setter (2,974 genes). In contrast, only 19% of the genes shared at least the same AS event type in both cultivars (Fig. 3B; white numerals). Thus, we postulate that the HS-dependent accumulation of IR and ES appears to be more global, while the reduction seems to be more cultivar specific (Fig. 3A and B).

Numbers in white and bold lines indicate genes showing at least one common IR or ES event in both cultivars.Finally, we inspected for all genes found to be modulated by IR or ES whether at least one event targets the same intron or exon in both cultivars. In total, we observed 2,343 genes for which the same AS event shows HS-dependent accumulation and 451 genes with the same HS-dependent AS reduction event in both cultivars. Subsequently, enrichment of GO terms was performed to identify the cellular functions that are affected by alterations of IR or ES events in response to HS (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the analysis of the 451 genes with HS-dependent IR or ES reduction did not lead to the enrichment of any biological category annotated in the GO term database.

Coloring of the biological process terms is related to their affiliation to functional categories, namely heat response (orange); gene expression (red), biosynthetic processes (green) as well as transport and localization (blue).HS-dependent IR or ES accumulation was found to be enriched in genes coding for proteins represented by 33 GO terms (Fig. 4), which fall in four general functional categories: (i) gene expression, RNA modification, translation and protein folding (Fig. 4, red), (ii) localization and transport (Fig. 4, blue), (iii) heat response (Fig. 4, orange) and (iv) metabolic related processes (Fig. 4, green). One of the most enriched GO terms is protein folding and gene expression. In the category protein folding we identified genes coding for Hsps, namely seven genes coding for Hsp90, four for Hsp70, eight for HSP60, seven for Hsp40 and three for HSP10 (Table 2). With this, we found IR or ES events for all Hsp90 coding genes, 19% of all Hsp70 coding genes, 44% of all HSP60 coding genes, 7% of all Hsp40 coding genes and 75% of all HSP10 coding genes.2 The category gene expression comprised many transcription factors including six Hsfs (Table 2).11 The latter is remarkable, as 27 Hsf coding genes exist in the genome of tomato11 and thus, for 22% a HS-dependent accumulation of a splice variant is found. This observation suggests that AS is involved in the complex regulatory network of HSR.12Genes involved in protein folding and gene expression altered by HS-dependent IR or ES accumulationGenes involved in protein folding and gene expression altered by HS-dependent IR or ES accumulation3.4. Occurrence of HS-related alternative transcriptsSo far, AS events were analysed independently for each intron and exon without drawing conclusions concerning putative transcripts. Therefore, we performed reference based transcriptome assembly for the 2,343 and 451 genes showing HS-dependent accumulation or reduction of IR and ES events, respectively, in both cultivars (see ‘Materials and methods’ section). In brief, reads aligned to the genomic sequence in the range of 1 kb downstream to 1 kb upstream of the respective genes were collected for all four RNA-seq libraries (Moneymaker CO & HS and Red Setter CO & HS). These reads were used for each individual library as input for the transcriptome assembly. All assembled transcripts were annotated according to the annotation of the Heinz genome (ITAG2.4). For the 451 genes with HS-dependent reduction of AS about 1,400–1,900 transcripts were assembled in the various pools. More than 90% of these transcripts are assigned to gene identifiers (Table 3). The remaining transcripts without assignment to gene identifiers result from reads aligned in proximity to the genes of interest, but are not derived from these. For genes with HS-dependent accumulation of AS ~6,900 to 9,100 transcripts were established, and again >90% of the transcripts could be assigned to at least one gene of the reference genome (Table 3). Transcriptome assembly descriptive statisticsGiven is the number of assembled transcripts and assembled transcripts with assigned SolycID for the Moneymaker and Red Setter CO and HS libraries with HS-dependent reduction or accumulation of alternative spliced transcripts.Transcriptome assembly descriptive statisticsGiven is the number of assembled transcripts and assembled transcripts with assigned SolycID for the Moneymaker and Red Setter CO and HS libraries with HS-dependent reduction or accumulation of alternative spliced transcripts.In depth analysis yielded 332 transcripts occurring only after HS (HS-specific transcripts) and 70 transcripts only under CO conditions (HS-repressed transcripts) in both cultivars. At first we confirmed that all of those transcripts are assigned to at least one gene of the reference genome. Second, we removed transcripts with inconsistent length, lack of CDS or assignment to more than one identifier as described in methods. Removal was performed due to the fact that these transcripts could comprise non-fully assembled transcripts and might represent misannotations in the ITAG2.4, which were not in the focus of our study. 58 and 69% of all HS-specific and HS-repressed transcripts, respectively, were excluded by this procedure from further analyses. The remaining 141 HS-specific and 22 HS-repressed transcripts were classified in five categories according to the AS event observed. Category ‘i’ unifies transcripts with IR only (i, only IR), category ‘ii’ transcripts with ES only (ii, only ES) and category ‘iii’ transcripts with IR and ES only (iii, IR + ES). Transcripts with other AS events in addition to or even in the absence of IR or ES (iv, others) were annotated as category ‘iv’ and transcripts without AS when compared with the ITAG2.4 as category ‘v’ (v, perfectly; Fig. 5). The latter two occurred if other events than IR or ES arise (i.e. AA, AD, not annotated introns or not annotated exons) or if the transcript annotated in the ITAG2.4 is only detected after HS and CO, respectively. Most transcripts show only IR (i: 36% HS-specific, 50% HS-repressed), while another large fraction represents perfectly spliced transcripts (v: 26% HS-specific, 23% HS-repressed). Interestingly, 26% of the HS-specific and of the 23% HS-repressed transcripts show modifications of the transcript distinct from IR or ES (iv). The results of the reference based transcriptome assembly were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of three randomly selected genes with HS-specific transcripts and one gene constitutively spliced under all conditions (Supplementary Materials S9).

Numbers above the bars indicate the amount of transcripts assigned to the different categories.Afterwards the length of the CDS represented by the HS-specific and repressed transcripts was compared with the annotated CDSs (ITAG2.4). As expected no alterations of CDS length was observed for all perfectly spliced transcripts (perfectly; Fig. 5). In turn, the CDS encoded by the transcripts of category ‘i’–‘iv’ showed generally a length reduction (Fig. 5). Although this was expected for transcripts with ES, the shortened CDS for transcripts of category ‘i’ and ‘iv’ suggests the occurrence of PTCs. Therefore, alterations in the architecture of functional domains can be expected as well as the occurrence of PTCs.3.5. Transcripts coding for proteins with altered domain architecture upon HSWe analysed the domain architecture of the proteins putatively translated from the CDS of the HS-repressed or specific transcripts. Each CDS was translated into a protein sequence followed by a domain search with HMMER (hmmsearch).48 Predicted domains were compared with domains annotated for the proteins encoded by the CDS of the ITAG2.4. For both, the HS-repressed and specific proteins, at least 54% of the proteins had the same domain architecture as predicted for the annotated gene (No change; Table 4). Only five HS-specific proteins showed a gain of functional domains (Gain and Gain + Loss; Table 4). Nevertheless, only for the F-box/LRR-repeat protein (Solyc10g080020) a new F-box domain was detected going along with loss of a Fist_C domain. The remaining proteins showed either an AS-induced domain split, which led to the detection of two sub-domains, or an AS-induced transition to a similar domain. For example, the Calpain-2 catalytic subunit (Solyc11g068460) showed an IR induced switch from EF_hand_5 to left-hand domain. In turn, loss of domains constitutes for all of the alterations of the HS-repressed proteins and 88% of the alterations of the HS-specific proteins (Loss, Table 4). To analyse this dominant effect of domain loss in more detail, all proteins with partial domain loss and translated from transcripts containing only IR and ES were inspected in more detail (Table 5). Domain alterations of HS-repressed and specific proteinsGiven is the number of HS-repressed and specific proteins with alterations in domain architecture; either domain gain, loss, gain and loss, or no changes in domain architecture with respect to predicted domains for annotated ITAG2.4 proteins.Domain alterations of HS-repressed and specific proteinsGiven is the number of HS-repressed and specific proteins with alterations in domain architecture; either domain gain, loss, gain and loss, or no changes in domain architecture with respect to predicted domains for annotated ITAG2.4 proteins.Proteins with partial domain loss encoded by alternatively spliced isoformsListed are the category (HS-repressed/specific), the AS process leading to the isoform, the accession number, the putative function of the protein, percentage of CDS length compared with the ITAG2.4 and domains present (black), completely (grey) or partially absent (black to grey color gradient).Proteins with partial domain loss encoded by alternatively spliced isoformsListed are the category (HS-repressed/specific), the AS process leading to the isoform, the accession number, the putative function of the protein, percentage of CDS length compared with the ITAG2.4 and domains present (black), completely (grey) or partially absent (black to grey color gradient).We detected three HS-repressed transcripts that coded for proteins with the loss of at least one functional domain. We observed a transcript for the transcription initiation factor IIB (Solyc10g079360.5) coding for the protein without the two TFIIB repeats (TFIIB). The rhomboid protease GlpG (Solyc10g081600.1) encoded by the AS transcript does not contain the ubiquitin associated domain. Moreover, the AS containing transcript for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Solyc12g098930.1) does not code for the ATPase domain (HATPase_c).In turn, seven proteins translated from HS-specific transcripts with at least one completely lost domain were detected. For four of the seven proteins (Solyc01g065490.1; Solyc05g053190.1; Solyc08g081070.3; Solyc11g069490.1) lost only repeated domains or motifs due to IR or ES. The remaining three proteins are the putative cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex subunit (Solyc09g074680.1), which is lacking its neddylation site, a transcription initiation factor (Solyc04g078050.2) missing the TAF4 domain and the RNA helicase DEAD32 (Solyc10g009070.2) lacking the DBP10CT domain. The partial domain loss observed for these proteins raises the question whether the proteins would still be functional with either reduced or alternative function or if the underlying transcripts are triggered for NMD.4. Discussion4.1. The degree of AS in response to HS is cultivar specificAS is a central regulatory mechanism to adjust transcript abundance or expand the diversity of the protein content.15–17 The observed number of AS events and the ratio between IR, ES, AD and AA events in tomato pollen (Fig. 1) are in agreement with recent studies on young tomato fruits.19 Furthermore, similar AS profiles have been observed in cereals27 and different tissues of Zea mays.51 Both studies demonstrated that IR is the most dominant AS event, followed by AA, AD and ES, which is the general tendency in plants.20 Moreover, we report an increase of the number of genes for which transcripts with IR or ES are identified under HS conditions (Fig. 1). Although this observation stands in contrast to the reported AS alteration in response to HS in Physcomitrella patens,18 our findings are in line with the observed enhanced number of IR events in response to salt and cold stress in A.thaliana and S.lycopersicum.52,53 Consequently, these studies and our findings suggest that IR is a tissue independent general stress response mechanism.In pollen, AS is a general regulatory process, independent of transctipt abundance or regulation under HS (Supplementary Materials S6), or even with the number of introns of a gene (Supplementary Materials S8). The amount of observed IR and ES events after HS application is comparable between both tested cultivars (Fig. 1) and many HS-dependent accumulated or reduced IR and ES events were commonly detected in both cultivars (Supplementary Materials S5). For example, about 80% of all genes with transcripts carrying a HS dependent accumulated IR were found in both, Moneymaker and Red Setter. However, the number of genes with HS-dependent accumulated AS (2,343) exceeds the number of genes with HS reduced AS by a factor of five (451). This difference might be due to the reduced functionality of the spliceosome under HS, which is supported by the high number of HS-induced IR events.54,55 However, the process of stress regulated AS is at least in parts specific. On the one hand, while many of alternative spliced transcripts carry NMD features, it was observed in A. thaliana that this does not necessarily lead to NMD.22 On the other hand, we observed a decline of specific AS events in response to HS (Fig. 3), which might be related to a reprogramming of splicing. The large overlap of observed AS events after HS between the two cultivars might even suggest that HS-induced AS is global regulatory mechanism rather than a cultivar specific event.Although the degree of AS after HS is comparable between both cultivars (Fig. 1), differences in the amount of IR and ES events were observed in the transcriptome of non-stressed pollen (Fig. 1). Although the number of AS events is largely increased in pollen of Moneymaker after HS treatment, a high overlap (78%) of genes with transcripts with IR found under CO and HS conditions was observed for Red Setter. One possible interpretation could be that Red Setter exhibits higher sensitivity against HS than Moneymaker and HS-induced alteration already occur at conditions used as control. However, irrespective of the reason for the difference found for Red Setter and Moneymaker, due to the high amount of IR under control conditions Red Setter seems to have a lower capacity for alterations of the transcriptome by AS under HS than Moneymaker.4.2. HS-related AS targets genes involved in HSRCommonly identified HS induced AS events in both cultivars mainly target genes coding for factors involved in protein folding and gene expression among other processes (Fig. 4). Within these functional categories, we realized an enrichment of AS events in HS related genes like Hsps and Hsfs exclusively under HS (Table 2). Therefore, we aimed to analyse these two protein families in more detail with respect to HS-dependent accumulation of IR and ES events as not all members of these families were represented in the protein folding and gene expression category (Supplementary Materials S10). Within the set of Hsfs we observed up to four HS accumulated AS events in at least one cultivar, whereby the majority of these Hsfs were up-regulated upon HS like for example HsfA2 (Solyc08g062960) for both Moneymaker and Red Setter. In Hsp families 90, 70, 60 and 40 on the other side, the majority of Hsps were constitutively expressed but both HS induced and constitutively expressed Hsps showed a high degree of HS accumulated AS. For example, the two HS induced Hsp90s (Solyc06g036290 and Solyc03g007890) showed both two IR events and the constitutively expressed Hsp70-12 (Solyc01g106210) four IR events in both cultivars. A similar pattern was observed for the Hsp100 family, where the HS induced ClpB3 (Solyc02g088610) comprised seven HS accumulated IR events in Red Setter and the constitutively expressed ClpC1 (Solyc03g118340) two IR events in both cultivars.The AS of Hsfs has been described in a variety of plant species, such as Medicago sativa, A.thaliana or Oryza sativa56,57 and for different members of this family, including the HS induced HsfA2 in A.thaliana.12,58 Many of these Hsf splice variants were shown to be subjected to NMD; however, for the HsfA2-III splice variant of A.thaliana a truncated translation product was detected.57 In contrast, for Hsps less about AS events is known. But for instance in human and rat, splice variants of heat-shock cognate protein 70 were identified, which are translated into truncated proteins lacking about 150 amino acid residues of the full-length protein.59,60 In addition, AS of mouse HSP47 was shown to be induced by heat shock leading to an extension of the 5'UTR by 169 nucleotides and by this to higher translation efficiency.61 The HS accumulated IR events we observed for the different constitutively expressed and HS induced Hsps were all introducing PTCs. One possible reason might be that although we excluded a global dependency of AS detection from expression of the underlying gene (Supplementary Materials S6), some of the IR events and especially the low abundant might be related to noisy splicing introduced by errors in the splicing process instead of a targeted process.62–64 On the other hand, the PTCs could lead to degradation of Hsp mRNAs by the NMD pathway if the mRNAs are NMD-sensitive.22 As we used pooled samples extracted directly after HS and after a recovery period, the IR events observed for the constitutively expressed Hsps might be associated to the sample extracted directly after HS, where transcript levels of these Hsps should be reduced with the purpose of a higher translation rate of HS induced Hsps.65 Similarly, IR events of HS induced Hsps might be related to the recovery period, where HS induced Hsps are no longer required and reduced by degradation of the respective PTC containing mRNAs.66 This mechanism has been described in mammals where targeted introduction of PTCs by retained introns led to degradation of transcripts not required for the physiology of the cell.534.3. HS-related AS results in alteration of protein sequencesBy reference based transcriptome assembly we detected various isoforms of pre-selected genes containing AS events accumulated or reduced dependent on HS compared with the annotation of tomato cultivar Heinz (ITAG 2.4).38 Within the 141 HS-specific and the 22 with HS-repressed transcripts, we observed an AS-induced length reduction of the CDS mainly due to PTC occurrence (Fig. 5). Although most of these transcripts carry classical NMD features, it was recently shown that at least for some genes IR transcripts possessing NMD features are not sensitive to NMD.22 This suggests that at least 36% of HS-specific transcripts (Fig. 5, only IR) are putatively translated and not degraded. Among these proteins translated, six show a loss of at least one functional domain. The lack of one or more functional domains was shown to be a negative regulatory mechanism, where truncated isoforms may lack important domains but still form nonfunctional dimers that may compete with functional dimers.24,67 This negative regulation was for example shown for different transcription factors68 and in our study we could also detect two transcription initiation factors (Solyc10g079360 and Solyc04g078050) having a putative competing isoform under HS. In addition, the observed C-terminal truncation of protein domains has been described recently.69 Such terminal domain truncation, also known as domain atrophy, may be introduced by PTCs but contrary to the expectation leaves the domain often functional, albeit reduced. Next to the proteins showing AS-induced domain loss, 26% of HS-specific transcripts were perfectly spliced (Fig. 5; perfectly). This means that under HS the normal protein function is maintained, whereas under CO either an alternative functionality of the protein or a degradation of the transcripts may occur.Up to now, the main focus of studies dealing with cellular response to HS was focused on genes showing expression changes upon HS70,71 as these are likely candidates with important roles in stress-regulatory networks.68 However, this procedure may have underestimated the importance of genes with constant expression. These genes may not contribute to the cellular stress response by expression changes but AS transcripts, which offers a new layer of stress response. To verify whether such a regulation exists, we first extracted HS-specific transcripts (Table 4) and divided them in two pools comprised of (i) 14 transcripts containing an AS event inducing domain gain and/or loss (Supplementary Materials S11, red) and (ii) 37 perfectly spliced transcripts (Supplementary Materials S11, green). Second, expression levels of the underlying genes were compared for HS and CO of both cultivars and by this constantly expressed genes under both conditions could be identified (Supplementary Materials S11). The general tendency of expression levels was comparable between CO and HS for both pools supporting evidence for the proposed new layer of stress response (Fig. 6). Beside HSR regulated by up- or down-regulation of specific genes (Fig. 6; 1 and 3) we propose HSR by AS in the case of constant gene expression (Fig. 6; 2). The AS driven HSR can take place either under HS (Fig. 6; 2A) leading to a competing isoform or under CO (Fig. 6; 2B), at which the constitutively spliced isoform is expressed under HS. The transcript levels of selected genes supporting this new regulatory concept were verified by qPCR (Supplementary Materials S12), which revealed constant expression between CO and HS samples for both Moneymaker and Red Setter.

Gene models for the annotated ITAG2.4 isoform and the HS or CO specific isoforms are provided as well as the domain architecture of the translated protein.To exemplify regulation under HS by AS, we chose two candidates of the first pool (i), namely the ubiquitin ligase complex subunit Cullin 1B (Solyc09g074680) and the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 regulatory subunit 3 (PP6R3, Solyc11g069490). Cullin proteins are evolutionary conserved proteins acting as scaffold in multi-subunit CRL complexes required for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.72 Cullin proteins are composed of a conserved cullin domain and a neddylation site.73 Conjugation of the ubiquitine-like molecule Nedd8 to the neddylation site leads to activation of the CRL complex.72 In addition, CRL complexes were shown to be involved in plant abiotic stress pathways including first indications for their involvement in temperature stress response.74 The isoform only detected under HS revealed retention of intron 17 leading to a PTC and a C-terminal truncation of 16.47%. The truncation comprised the entire neddylation site (Cullin_Nedd8) and a small portion of the cullin domain (Cullin). A possible effect of the truncation might be that the CRL complex is not fully assembled or remains in an inactive state due to the inability for neddylation. This assumption is supported by results in Xaneopus laevis, where C-terminally truncated Cullin-1 constructs were shown to have negative effects on ubiquitination by titrating out endogeneous components into inactive complexes, leading to an increase of degradation targets.75 The second protein exemplifying response by AS under HS is PP6R3. PP6R3 forms together with the catalytic subunit PP6c and an ankyrin repeat-containing protein the heterotrimeric PP6 holoenzyme complex, which is required for regulation of different signaling pathways.76 The involvement of serine/threonine phosphatases in HSR was shown by overexpression of the AtPP5, which led to enhanced heat shock resistance of A.thaliana.77 The HS-specific PP6R3 isoform showed retention of intron 12 comprising a PTC leading to a truncation including about 51% of the SAPS domain. If the truncated SAPS domain is still functional, like in the case of domain atrophy,69 the binding to PP6c might still be feasible, as the SAPS domain is sufficient for binding. However, the interaction of PP6R3 with the ankyrin-repeat subunit would not be feasible anymore as the C-terminal region is required for interaction.78 This may suggest that like in the case of Cullin 1B, the observed PP6R3 isoform leads to inactive PP6 complexes having a contrary effect on signal transduction. In the end, these results exemplify our proposed model, at which the transcript abundance is constant but different AS isoforms serve as alternative layer of HSR.We would like to thank Daniela Bublak for excellent technical assistance and members of the SPOT-ITN consortium for helpful comments during the manuscript preparation.

IntroductionWhole-genome analyses have identified a class of regulatory regions that contain elements that initiate transcription of two different genes positioned with a head-to-head (5'–5') orientation on opposite strands of the DNA. These regions termed ‘bidirectional promoters’1–3 (BiPs) often have fewer than 1,000 base pairs separating the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the two genes. Bidirectional promoters have been known for years;4 however, recent genome-scale studies have shown that the regulation of the expression of up to 10% of the genes is controlled by bidirectional promoters.3 Bidirectional promoters are a common feature within not only the human genome but are also present in many other genomes, including yeast, plants, Invertebrates and Vertebrates.1–3,5–17 It has been shown that some bidirectional promoters, such as those of the histone genes, regulate the transcription of pair of genes that need coordinated expression to maintain stoichiometric relationships,18 or regulate the coexpression of genes that function in the same biological pathway.19 Detailed studies on bidirectional promoters have also shown that some are widely conserved among Vertebrates.20–23 The presence of such genomic architecture in many metazoans and the high inter-species conservation seen for some bidirectional promoters suggest that they are functionally important.Despite substantial interest in bidirectional promoters, the functional mechanisms underlying the activation of bidirectional promoters are currently not well characterized and, to our knowledge, no analysis of the variability of the activity of bidirectional promoters has been done so far.The aim of our study was to explore bidirectional promoter activity variation and to identify if genetic variants contribute to this variability. We performed this study in bovine Longissimus thoracis (LT). First, we identified bovine bidirectional promoters active in muscle, combining bovine gene information and RNA-Seq data. We then experimentally validated in vitro a subset of these bidirectional promoters. Finally, using gene expression and whole-genome genotyping data generated for 20 samples, we explore the variability of the activity in muscle of the identified bidirectional promoters and discovered genetic variants affecting this activity. We identified 120 bovine bidirectional promoters active in LT. A total of 16 bidirectional promoters were selected and all were validated experimentally in vitro. As we had RNA-Seq data for 20 different samples from the same tissue, it is possible to analyse the inter-individual variability of the activity of these 120 bidirectional promoters. As previously described, expression levels of gene pairs sharing a BiP are more correlated than those of neighbouring gene pairs in a unidirectional or convergent configuration.In addition, we found that the expression level of 77 genes is highly correlated with the activity of 12 bidirectional promoters active in muscle. We also identified 57 SNPs associated significantly with the activity of 5 bidirectional promoters.To our knowledge, our study is the first analysis in any species of the genetic variability of the activity of bidirectional promoters.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and tissue samplesThe study was conducted with 11 Limousin bull calves from a large study on the genetic determinism of beef and meat quality traits.24 These eleven bull calves were not closely related to one another (for at least four generations). They were fattened in a single feedlot and fed ad libidum with wet corn silage. They were humanely slaughtered in an accredited commercial slaughterhouse when they reached 16 months. LT muscle samples were dissected immediately after death and tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analysis.2.2. RNA sequencing and data analysisRNA extraction and sequencing were performed as previously described.25,26 Briefly, after transfer to ice-cold RNeasy RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen), LT tissue samples were homogenized using a Precellys tissue homogeniser (Bertin Technologie). Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Midi columns (Qiagen) and then treated with RNAse-free DNase I (Qiagen) for 15 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The concentration of total RNA was measured with a Nanodrop ND-100 instrument (Thermo Scientific) and the quality was assessed with an RNA 6000 Nano Labchip kit using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). All 11 samples had an RNA integrity number (RIN) value greater than eight.The mRNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified from 4 µg total RNA of each sample using oligo(dT) magnetic beads and fragmented into 150–400 bp pieces using divalent cations at 94 °C for 8 min. The cleaved mRNA fragments were converted to double-stranded cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) and primed by random primers. The resulting cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure® XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Then, cDNA was subjected to end-repair and phosphorylation and subsequent purification was performed using Agencourt AMPure® XP beads (Beckman Coulter). These repaired cDNA fragments were 3'-adenylated producing cDNA fragments with a single ‘A’ base overhung at their 3'-ends for subsequent adapter-ligation. Illumina adapters containing indexing tags were ligated to the ends of these 3'-adenylated cDNA fragments followed by two purification steps using Agencourt AMPure® XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Ten rounds of PCR amplification were performed to enrich the adapter-modified cDNA library using primers complementary to the ends of the adapters. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure® XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and size-selected (200 ± 25 bp) on a 2% agarose Invitrogen E-Gel (Thermo Scientific). Libraries were then checked on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit and quantified by quantitative PCR with the QPCR NGS Library Quantification kit (Agilent Technologies). After quantification, three different tagged cDNA libraries were pooled in equal ratios and a final qPCR check was performed post-pooling. Each library pool was used for 2 × 100 bp paired-end sequencing on one lane of the Illumina HiSeq2000 with a TruSeq SBS v3-HS Kit (Illumina). After sequencing, the samples were demultiplexed and the indexed adapter sequences were trimmed using the CASAVA v1.8.2 software (Illumina).The Bos taurus reference transcriptome was downloaded from Ensembl (version 63, Bos_taurus.Btau_4.0.63.cdna.all.fa). To align the reads back to the assembled reference transcriptome the BWA programme (version 0.5.9-r16) was used.27 Reads were mapped for each sample separately to the assembled transcriptome. The BWA default values were used for mapping. Properly paired reads with a mapping quality of at least 30 (-q = 30) were extracted from the resulting BAM file using SAMtools28 for further analyses. Properly paired is defined as both left and right reads mapped in opposite directions on the same transcript at a distance compatible with the expected mean size of the fragments (<500 bp). Custom scripts were developed to identify paired-reads mapping to single locations and with the expected distance. Read pairs mapping to separate chromosomes were discarded for the present study. The number of paired-reads uniquely aligning to transcribed regions of each transcript was calculated for all genes in the annotated transcriptome. The transcript paired-read count was calculated as the number of unique paired-reads that aligned within the exons of each transcript, based on the coordinates of mapped reads.2.3. SNP identificationBWA was also used to map reads onto the bovine genome assembly UMD3.1 version.29 Only reliable properly paired BWA mapped reads were considered for SNP calling. Indels were not considered because alternative splicing impedes reliable indel discovery. SNPs were called using the SAMtools software package. Genotype likelihoods were computed using the SAMtools utilities and variable positions in the aligned reads compared with the reference were called with the BCFtools utilities.30 SNPs were called only for positions with a minimal mapping quality (-Q) of 30, a minimum coverage (-d) of 4 and a maximum read depth (-D) of 10,000,000.2.4. Data and statistical analysesInformation on bovine genes were obtained from the Ensembl Genome Browser (version 84) using the BioMart tool.31 Functional annotation analysis of genes sharing putative bidirectional promoters was done using the FATIGO tool of the online software suite Babelomics.32 Genes were assigned their Ensembl identities as input for Babelomics. Only one copy of each gene was used. Default parameter settings were used for the analysis. Statistical assessment of annotation differences between the two sets of sequences (SNP-containing genes versus all the other bovine genes) was carried out for each FATIGO analysis, using the Fisher Exact Test with correction for multiple testing. Prediction of putative TFBSs was performed using the bioinformatics tools MATCH.33 It uses a library of positional weight matrices from TRANSFAC 6.0 public version.34 A cut-off selection of 0.7 and 0.75 was applied for matrix and core similarities, respectively. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated for the correlation studies using the statistical R package.2.5. Bidirectional promoter validationEach putative bidirectional promoter region was PCR amplified from bovine genomic DNA using a pair of primers. The genomic DNA sequences were retrieved from the UCSC Genome Database. Sequence repeats were masked using RepeatMasker35 and Primer336 was then used to design primer pairs to amplify each putative bidirectional promoter region. PCR primers were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon. Restriction enzyme cutting sites for EcoRI (GAATTC) and BamHI (GGATCC) were artificially added into the PCR primers to facilitate directional cloning. Primer sequences are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Polymerase chain reactions were performed in 50 µl using 120 ng genomic DNA, 1 × PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.3 µM of each primer and 1U AccuPrime GC-rich Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The following cycling protocol was used: 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. To check the quality of the amplification, 5 µl of PCR products were then analysed by gel electrophoresis with a 1% agarose gel. The PCR products were purified using the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with EcoRI and BamHI (New England Biolabs), purified with Qiagen Reaction Cleanup kit, quantified and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to the pBiP0 vector at a 3:1 ratio. The vector was previously digested with EcoRI/BamHI and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a competent cells (Invitrogen). Ten clones were then amplified and plasmids were purified with the Pureyield Plasmid Miniprep System DNA purification kit (Promega). Positive clones were identified by digesting plasmid DNA with EcoRI and BamHI. Digestion products were then visualized after gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. One clone carrying the right plasmid construct was then amplified and plasmids were purified with the Macherey-Nagel Midi Endotoxin-free plasmid DNA purification kit. The plasmids were then sequenced bidirectionally using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and the primers used for the PCR amplification. After purification on Sephadex G50 superfine column (GE Healthcare), the sequencing reaction products were analyzed using 3130 Genetic Analyzer sequencer (Applied Biosystems). One clone containing for each cloning orientation the right plasmid construct was then chosen.Murine C2C12 myoblastic cells (ATCC CRL-1772) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with Glutamax-I (4.5 g/l glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. C2C12 (~25,000 cells/well) were seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Transfections were performed on 40% confluent C2C12 cells with TurboFect transfection reagent (Fermentas) using 2 µl of reagent per µg of DNA plasmid, during 4 h according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were transfected with 0.8 µg of the vectors carrying unidirectional pCMV1/pCMV2 promoters or putative bidirectional promoters or with pBI-CMV2, pBiP-DsRed, pBiP0 control vectors.37 All transient transfection experiments were done in triplicate and repeated three times. Thirty-six hours after transfection cells were washed two times with PBS 1×, and then viewed with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss) and images were acquired using a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Photometrics) driven by the Axiovision imaging system software. Analyses of micrographies were performed using the AxioVision 4.7.2 software (Zeiss). Filter sets 38HE [excitation BP470/40(HE) and emission BP525/50(HE)] and 43HE [excitation BP545/30(HE) and emission BP620/60(HE)] were used to visualize AcGFP1 and DsRed monomer signals, respectively. Each reporter gene assay was performed in triplicate and with three independent transfection experiments.2.6. Whole-genome SNP genotypingMuscle samples were obtained and genomic DNA extracted using the DNA Midi kit (Qiagen). Quality of DNA was checked using a Nanodrop ND-100 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and quantity was estimated with Quant-iT Picogreen dsDNA kit (Life Technologies) on an ABI 7900HT (Life Technologies). All DNA samples were standardized to 50 ng/µL.DNA samples were genotyped on the BovineSNP50 Genotyping Beadchips (Illumina) at LABOGENA (Jouy-en-Josas, France) using the standard operating procedures recommended by the manufacturer.3. Results and discussion3.1. Bovine muscle whole-transcriptome analysisTo identify bidirectional promoters active in bovine muscle, we first obtained a global view of the bovine LT transcriptome using paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) from twenty Limousin bull calves. We used already-published data from nine Limousin animals25,26 and poly(A)-enriched mRNA from 11 new Limousin bull calves were retrotranscribed and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. The 11 RNA-Seq libraries were barcode-tagged and sequenced on five lanes (3 libraries per lane) of an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer. Sequencing of cDNA libraries generated a total of 1,303 million raw paired-end reads with a length of 100 bases, resulting in a total of 130 gigabases. The reads were then de-multiplexed to assign reads to each sequenced sample according to its barcode index. Approximately 17–48 million paired-end reads were obtained for each library. Reads from each sample were then mapped back to the bovine reference transcriptome. We used the set of Bos taurus Ensembl transcripts v63 RefSeq genes as the reference transcriptome. This set contains transcripts for 22,915 known or novel genes but also pseudogenes. Based on mappings done using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) programme, 67–81% of the mapped reads were aligned properly paired (Supplementary Table S2). A total of 22,025 transcripts (18,055 genes) were identified, with at least one paired-end read in all samples analysed. Similar RNA-Seq read mapping rate and the number of genes identified were obtained in other RNA-Seq bovine studies. For example, Chitwood et al.38 found that ~69% of the RNA-Seq reads they generated while sequencing the transcriptomes of single bovine blastocysts mapped uniquely onto the bovine genome. Raw gene expression levels were estimated by measuring the normalized count number for each transcript (number of reads per transcript divided by the total number of mapped reads, for each sample). The five most frequent transcripts are shown in Table 1. These five genes represented nearly 17% of all sequencing reads mapped to the bovine genome and are associated with muscle cell metabolism or structure. These results were consistent with the physiological role of genes expected in the surveyed tissue. Not all genes were expressed among all samples. A total of 14,700 transcripts corresponding to 12,314 different genes were detected in all 20 samples, while 840 different genes (~4%) were only expressed in one sample at a very low level (with on average less than 2 reads). Top five transcripts with the most assigned readsTop five transcripts with the most assigned reads3.2. Identification of putative bidirectional promoters shared by genes co-expressed in bovine LTIn order to identify putative bidirectional promoters active in bovine muscle, the chromosomal locations of all the bovine genes were retreived from the Ensembl database (version 84).31 The Ensembl gene start sites were used as the TSS. Pair of genes in a head-to-head arrangement and separated by less than 1 kb between their TSSs were identified and the region between paired-genes were considered as putative bidirectional promoters. Among the 24,616 bovine genes annotated on the UMD3.1 genome assembly, we found 563 putative bidirectional promoters (Supplementary Table S3). The number of bovine bidirectional promoters we predicted is very similar to the one calculated by Xu et al.,39 who found 574 putative bidirectional promoters in cattle.To overcome confusion during the subsequent analyses, we then used four filters (Supplementary Fig. S1). First, we removed all gene pairs for which at least one gene had paralogous sequences identified in the Ensembl database and predicted 192 bidirectional promoters. Second, we retained only gene pairs associated with these putative BiPs and for which we could detect the expression for both paired-genes in our RNA-Seq dataset, leaving 171 cases. Third, to avoid quantification problems relative to transcript isoforms, genes with known alternative transcripts were excluded from the study. Finally, for validation purposes, we only selected bidirectional promoters between protein-coding gene pairs. In total, 120 BiPs remained, each with both genes expressed in muscle (Supplementary Table S4).3.3. Characteristics of genes shared by bidirectional promoters active in bovine LTTo characterise functions that are significantly enriched in genes sharing bidirectional promoters active in bovine muscle, a gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed. All the 120 co-expressed gene pairs could be analysed for functional classifications and were assigned to one or more GO annotations. GO term analysis showed a significant enrichment of specific GO terms when comparing the annotations of gene pairs associated with bidirectional promoters active in muscle against all transcripts from the bovine reference transcriptome. A summary of the classification of these genes into major biological process, cell component and molecular function categories is presented in Supplementary Table S5. Genes encoding proteins found in mitochondria, ribonucleoprotein complexes or organelle inner membrane or involved in chaperone binding and cellular response to DNA damage stimulus are significantly over-represented. No significant enrichment in KEGG terms/pathways was found. These results are in agreement with previous studies.1–3,5–7,12,40The chromosomal location of all bovine genes, of all the predicted bidirectional promoters and of the 120 BiPs active in muscle is presented in Fig. 1. Interestingly, the chromosomal distribution of these 120 bidirectional promoters does not reflect the gene content of the chromosomes (Mann–Whitney U-test, P-value <0.05). For example, we found only one (0.83%) predicted BiP active in muscle on BTA4, whereas this chromosome harbours 855 (3.48%) bovine genes. BTA11 and BTA19 have the highest number of bidirectional promoters active in muscle (both 11.67%) whereas these chromosomes have only ~4 and ~5%, respectively, of all bovine genes. The chromosomal location of the 120 BiPs active in muscle rather follows the chromosomal distribution of all bidirectional promoters predicted in cattle (Pearson correlation coefficient <U+03C1> = 0.802). For example, we found 0.89 and 0.83% predicted bidirectional promoters and BiPs active in muscle, respectively, on chromosome 4.Chromosomal distribution of the 120 putative bovine bidirectional promoters active in muscle.Chromosomal distribution of the 120 putative bovine bidirectional promoters active in muscle.3.4. Experimental validation of some predicted bidirectional promotersTo assess the promoter activity of the predicted bidirectional promoters, some bidirectional promoters were selected and cloned into the promoterless pBiP0 reporter vector we recently constructed.37 This plasmid is a dual reporter vector with the Green Fluorescent Protein gene from the Aequorea coerulescens jellyfish (AcGFP1) inserted in a head-to-head configuration relative to a gene expressing a monomer mutant form of the Red Fluorescent Protein gene from the Discosoma striata reef coral (DsRed monomer). Both fluorescent protein genes are devoid of promoter and separated by a short multiple cloning region.The sequences of predicted bidirectional promoters were downloaded from the UCSC database.41 To ensure that all regulatory elements were included each sequence was extended until the first ATG (ATG not included) of both paired genes. Among the 120 promoter sequences 18 contain cutting sites for EcoRI or BamHI and were eliminated, since these two restriction enzymes are used for cloning into the dual reporter vector. We previously validated one of these bidirectional promoters.23 Sixteen new bidirectional promoters were then randomly selected for validation. Information relative to these 16 predicted bidirectional promoters is indicated in Table 2. The selected promoter regions were amplified by PCR and then cloned into the pBiP0 vector. Inserts were checked by sequencing.

The pBI-CMV2 and pBiP-DsRed vectors were used as positive controls, whereas the empty pBiP0 vector was used as a negative control to verify that no reporter gene expression could be observed without promoter. The expression of the reporter genes was assessed by fluorescence microscopy 36 h after transfection to evaluate transfection efficiencies and check reporter activities. No significant reporter gene expression was observed with the empty pBiP0 transfected cells and positive signals were therefore attributed to the inserted sequences. Fluorescence microscopy analyses showed that all the 16 selected predicted bidirectional promoters seem to drive bidirectional expression in C2C12 cells, although variability in the reporter signals was observed (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). These good results suggest that the procedure we developed to detect bovine bidirectional promoters active in muscle is accurate and has a low false-positive rate.Fluorescence microscopy analysis of bidirectional promoter BiP100 in C2C12 cells.

Images were taken at x20 magnification, 36h after transfection.3.5. Co-expression analysis of genes shared by bidirectional promoters active in bovine muscleWe have in our study the expression levels of genes expressed in LT for twenty samples. It is therefore possible to analyse the co-expression of each pair of genes sharing a bidirectional promoter. Using the normalized expression levels, we calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for each gene pair. We found that 34% (41/120) of the genes shared by bidirectional promoters are co-expressed (P-value < 0.05%) (Supplementary Table S6). In order to evaluate whether gene pairs sharing bidirectional promoters were significantly enriched for co-expressed genes, we then performed a similar co-expression analysis for pairs of non-overlapping neighbouring genes in a tail–tail orientation (convergent configuration) or in the same orientation (unidirectional configuration). We identified these two different types of gene pairs using the chromosomal locations of all the bovine genes from the Ensembl database and using the same filters as for the identification of gene pairs sharing BiPs (Supplementary Fig. S1). We found 218 and 163 gene pairs in the convergent and unidirectional configurations (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8), respectively. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for each gene pair was then calculated using the normalized expressed levels measured in the 20 samples. Thirty-five percent (76/218) and 30.1% (49/163) of the gene pairs in the convergent and unidirectional configurations, respectively, were co-expressed (Supplementary Tables S9 and S10). The percentage of co-expressed genes is comparable for the bidirectional, convergent and unidirectional configurations, suggesting that co-expression is most likely mediated by shared chromatin environment rather than only by specific regulatory regions. Similar findings were previously found in other species, including yeast.42 In addition, on average the expression levels in muscle of gene pairs sharing a BiP were more correlated compared with pairs of neighbouring genes in a unidirectional or convergent configuration (Z-score test, P-value <0.05%). Using normalized gene expression counts previously measured in 18 bovine tissues and for three different cows,43,44 we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the expression levels of the 120 gene pairs sharing a BiP, the 163 gene pairs in an unidirectional configuration and the 218 gene pairs in a convergent configuration. We then compared the average expression correlation between these three types of gene pairs and found no significant differences between gene pairs in unidirectional and convergent configurations, but identified significant differences between gene pairs sharing a BiP and the other two types of gene pairs (Z-score test, P-value <0.05%), The higher correlation between expression levels of genes sharing BiPs has previously been described and is a common feature of bidirectional promoters.393.6. The activity of the bidirectional promoters is highly variableNot all the 240 genes sharing the 120 active bidirectional promoters were expressed in all the twenty samples. Among these genes, 227 genes (corresponding to 114 bidirectional promoters) were expressed in all 20 samples; whereas 13 genes (from 13 different bidirectional promoters) were expressed in all but one sample. In order to evaluate inter-individual variability of the activity of the bidirectional promoters active in muscle, we calculated for each sample the expression ratio of each gene pair (using normalized gene expression levels). We considered that the value of this ratio is a measure of the activity of the bidirectional promoter. We then calculated the coefficient of variation for the activity of each bidirectional promoter. We could calculate the activity (paired-gene ratio) only for 107 bidirectional promoters, as some genes were not expressed in some of the 20 samples. Interestingly there were significant differences when we compared the activity variability of these 107 bidirectional promoters. Thirteen bidirectional promoters had a thightly controled activity (CV <50%) whereas 41 had a very variable activity (CV >100%; Supplementary Table S11). These results suggest a strong or a loosened gene expression regulation of the gene pairs depending on the shared bidirectional promoter. This highly variable activity could be due to polymorphisms within the regulatory elements located within the bidirectional promoter regions.3.7. The expression level of some genes is highly correlated with the activity of some bidirectional promoters active in muscleThanks to the availability of the expression levels of genes expressed in LT for 20 samples, it is also possible to analyse the effect of these genes on the activity of the identified bidirectional promoters. Using the normalized expression levels, we calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for each bidirectional promoter ratio with each gene expressed within the 20 muscle samples. We found after correction for multiple testing 77 significant correlations (P < 1.9 × 10-8), between 77 different genes and the activity of 12 different bidirectional promoters (Supplementary Table S12). We found 74 positive correlations and only 3 negative correlations (anti-correlations). Among these 77 correlations, we could find 9 significant correlations between the activity of a bidirectional promoter and the expression level of one of the two paired-genes sharing the bidirectional promoter. To characterize the functions of the genes showing expression levels highly correlated with the activity of these 12 bidirectional promoters, we performed a GO annotation. No significant enrichment in GO terms and KEGG terms/pathways was found.Interestingly, with the exception of the paired-genes sharing a bidirectional promoter, no highly correlated genes were in close vicinity of the bidirectional promoter, indicating that the relationship between these genes and the bidirectional promoters are trans-effects. In addition, no genes are associated with more than a single bidirectional promoter, suggesting that the regulation of bidirectional promoters is highly variable and no master regulator genes may be at play.We have to be cautious with our results, as a significant correlation does not relate necessarily to an effect of the gene showing a high correlation on the activity of the bidirectional promoter. Indeed, the paired-genes sharing the bidirectional promoter could themselves have an impact on the regulation of the expression of the gene, for which the expression level shows a strong correlation. However, some of the genes showing a strong correlation with the activity of some of the bidirectional promoters encode for proteins involved in gene regulation, such as histones H2a.1 and H3.1 and transcription factors Hnf1a and Zfn133 and therefore might have direct effect on the activity of these bidirectional promoters. However, no binding sites for Hfn1a or Zfn133 were predicted within the sequence of bidirectional promoter #118 or #81, respectively. More work is needed to establish the directionality of the relationships detected with the correlation and the true involvement of identifed genes with regulatory functions.3.8. Some genetic variants might alter the activity of the bidirectional promoters active in muscleAfter assessing if some genes expressed in muscle influence the activity of the identified bidirectional promoters, we performed a similar analysis to this time identify DNA polymorphisms altering the activity of these bidirectional promoters.DNA samples from the twenty animals were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Genotyping Beadchips. Among the 54,001 SNPs included in the chip, only polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to bovine autosomes on the bovine genome assembly UMD3.1 version,29 genotyped on =90% of the individuals, without a low minor allele frequency (MAF =0.05) and in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (P-value <0.001) were retained for further analysis. 21,470 informative SNPs were left after all the filtering steps. We calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for each bidirectional promoter ratio with the genotypes of each SNP. We found after correction for multiple testing 27 significant correlations (11 and 16 positive and negative correlations respectively, P-value <1.94 × 10-8), between 27 different SNPs and the activity of 4 different bidirectional promoters. Annotation of these variants indicates that 20 SNPs are intergenic while the remaining 7 SNPs are within genes but none introduce missense changes in the corresponding proteins or are located in putative regulatory regions (Table 3). GO annotation of these seven genes did not reveal any significant enrichment. None of the intergenic or intronic SNPs were located within known genes encoding bovine long non-coding RNAs.26,45 The 27 SNPs were neither in close vicinity of the bidirectional promoter and they are all associated with only one bidirectional promoter. This suggest, as seen with the genes whose expression were significantly correlated with the activity of some bidirectional promoters that the effect of these SNPs are trans-effects and there might not be master regulator genes. In addition, annotation of these variants indicates that most SNPs are intergenic and it is unlikely that these 27 SNPs have any direct effect on the activity of the bidirectional promoter. List of SNPs from the Illumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip with genotypes highly correlated to the activity of some bidirectional promotersList of SNPs from the Illumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip with genotypes highly correlated to the activity of some bidirectional promotersIn order to identify SNPs altering directly the activity of some of the bidirectional promoters active in muscle, we performed another correlation analysis between the activity of the bidirectional promoters and this time the genotypes from coding SNPs identified with the RNA-Seq data. Mapped paired-end reads from each sample were used with the SAMtools package for variant calling. Using stringent parameters (e.g. minimum coverage of 8 reads and mapping quality of 20) we detected 8,121 different billalelic SNPs. Among the SNPs identified, similarly to the SNPs from the Illumina BovineSNP50 Genotyping Beadchip, we used only polymorphisms mapping to bovine autosomes, genotyped on =90% of the individuals, without a low minor allele frequency (MAF =0.05) and in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (P-value <0.001). A total of 8,116 informative SNPs were left after these filtering steps. We calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for each bidirectional promoter ratio with the genotypes of each SNP. We found after correction for multiple testing 30 significant correlations (P-value  <5.13 × 10-8), between 30 different SNPs (in 27 different genes) and the activity of 4 different bidirectional promoters (Table 4). Annotation of these variants indicates that all these SNPs are within protein-coding genes. GO annotation of the 27 genes containing the 30 coding SNPs (cSNPs) did not reveal any significant enrichment. None of the 30 cSNPs introduce missense changes in the corresponding proteins; however, 11 cSNPs are located in the upstream or downstream regions. List of coding SNPs with genotypes highly correlated to the activity of some bidirectional promotersList of coding SNPs with genotypes highly correlated to the activity of some bidirectional promotersWe found among these correlations a significant negative correlation between a cSNP within Taf9, a gene encoding the RNA polymerase II, TATA box binding protein-associated factor (TAF) 32kD (also known as TafII32 or Taf2g), and the activity of bidirectional promoter #118. TAF9 is involved in the initiation of the transcription by RNA polymerase II.46 Interestingly, Taf1, another TATA box binding factor has motifs over-represented in human bidirectional promoters47 and two-hybrid experiments performed in yeast have shown that Taf1 is able to bind to DNA but also to different TATA box binding factors, including Taf9.48 Many bidirectional promoters lack a TATA box;3,11 however, it has been shown that several TATA-less promoters require TAFs for transcription.47–53 The cSNP found in Taf9 is therefore an interesting variant and might point out an effect of Taf9 on the activity of bidirectional promoter #118.The 11 cSNPs might have an impact on the regulation of the corresponding gene, which in turn might affect the activity of some bidirectional promoters. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated for the genotypes of these 11 cSNPs and the normalized expression level of the corresponding gene (Table 5). Significant correlations were found at P-value <0.05 for 4 cSNPs, suggesting that these cSNPs have an effect on the regulation of the expression of their corresponding gene. The seven other cSNPs, including the variant found in Taf9, might have most probably an effect on the post-transcriptional regulation of the corresponding gene, which consequently alter the amount of proteins which then affect the activity of the bidirectional promoter. Correlation scores between cSNPs and the expression level of the corresponding geneCorrelation scores between cSNPs and the expression level of the corresponding gene3.9. Some bidirectional promoter regions are located within quantitative trait loci for meat-related phenotypesThe positions of the 120 bidirectional promoters sharing genes expressed in bovine LT were compared with the position of known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) deposited in the public database AnimalQTLdb.54 Fifty-four bidirectional promoters were located in 244 different QTL regions (Supplementary Table S14). For example, 7 different bidirectional promoters are found in 8 QTL regions for intramuscular fat; whereas 18 bidirectional promoters are within 18 QTLs for shear force. Karim et al.55 have shown that a genetic variant located within a bidirectional promoter shared by PLAG1 and CHCHD7 influences bovine stature. It will be interesting to investigate if variants within some of the bidirectional promoter regions we identified affect quantitative traits, including meat quality traits.4. ConclusionIn this study, we identified 120 bidirectional promoters active in bovine muscle and validated in vitro 16 of them. Using RNA-seq data from 20 muscle samples, we found that the activity of these bidirectional promoters is highly variable and that the expression level of 77 genes is highly correlated with the activity of 12 of the bidirectional promoters. We also identified 57 SNPs associated significantly with the activity of 5 bidirectional promoters. Interestingly, we found that a coding SNP within Taf9 has an effect on the activity of bidirectional promoter #118. To our knowledge, our study is the first analysis in any species of the genetic variability of the activity of bidirectional promoters.Data availabilityThe sequencing data have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (accession numbers ERP002220, E-MTAB-2646 and E-MTAB-4625).We are grateful to Sébastien Legardinier (UMR1061, Limoges) for the gift of the C2C12 cells and Jérôme Chapuis (UR892 INRA VIM, Jouy-en-Josas) for his help with the fluorescence microscope.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.The work was supported by the French National Research Agency (Regulomix project, contract ANR-09-GENM-011), French National Institute for Agricultural Research and the Limousin Regional Council.Supplementary data"

IntroductionEarly blight (EB) is one of the most devastating diseases of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) caused by Alternaria solani (Ellis & Martin) Sorauer, a necrotrophic fungus. The disease largely affects the older leaves, stem and fruits of tomato plants.1 Cultivars highly resistant to EB are not known.1 Progress in breeding for EB resistance has been, however, limited by the lack of effective resistance genes in cultivated tomato, and by polygenic inheritance of the resistance.2 Thus, there is an urgent need for identifying new sources of resistance or host factors that are altered during the pathogenesis process and could be modulated for coordinating the resistance response.Plants try to defend themselves against phytopathogens by coordinating defence-oriented transcriptional reprogramming of the affected cells. Several signalling and transcription factors are the key elements in this process. Expressions of some of these genes are regulated by miRNAs.3 It is expected that during tomato–Alternaria interaction expression of a set of miRNAs and mRNAs will be altered, however, such studies are lacking. Moreover, limited information is available about molecular signalling involved in tomato–necrotrophic pathogen interaction.Recently, the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been used to obtain comprehensive sequencing data for the detection and study of alteration of the expression levels of miRNAs or mRNAs in various plant species under different stress conditions including fungus–stress.4–9 The identified miRNAs primarily controlled the expression of genes encoding disease-resistance proteins, serine/threonine protein kinases and transcription factors. In a recent publication, microarray-based profiling of tomato mRNA during the early stage of A.solani infection has been reported,10 however, a detailed analysis is not available.For the proper understanding of the regulatory action of miRNA, an integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA transcriptome is a requisite. Using plant as the model system, only three such studies with other pathogen or treatment have been reported; these include rice–rice stripe virus (RSV) interaction, rice and Sedum alfredii-cadmium treatment.11–13 Interestingly, rice–RSV study revealed expression of 22 up-regulated miRNAs targeted 24 repressed mRNAs which are linked to disease resistance pathways.The best way of bestowing disease resistance to a plant is to potentiate its natural resistance mechanism. As mentioned earlier, transcriptional reprogramming and regulation of a set of gene/regulator would determine a plant’s response towards the pathogen. Deliberate alteration of expression of these factors potentially should control a plant’s response towards a pathogen. To appreciate fully the factors needed to be altered, the regulators of host processes during the pathogenesis and disease manifestation have to be unravelled. In this regard, a comparative analysis of control vs infected susceptible-plant is advantageous over studying the tolerant plant because multiple modes of tolerance are feasible; however, it is more likely that susceptibility response would follow a unique path. We hypothesized that several miRNAs have the crucial regulatory role in the transcriptional reprogramming process during Alternaria infection, and set out to uncover by genome-wide analysis of miRNA–mRNA relationships specifically regulated during the stress in tomato. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of integrating miRNA and mRNA transcriptome analysis data to endorse miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression during tomato–A.solani interaction. This combined analysis facilitated in gaining significant insights into the regulatory network of susceptible response against an agronomically important necrotrophic pathogen of tomato.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and treatment conditionTomato (S.lycopersicum L.) cultivar Pusa Ruby (Indian Agricultural Research Institute) was used in this study and is known to be susceptible to EB. Plants were grown in pots containing Soilrite (Keltech, India) at 25°C and under natural light with addition of Hoagland solution at regular interval. A.solani (obtained from IIVR, India) was cultured in potato dextrose agar plate at 25°C for 5 days in dark. Leaves of one and a half month old plants were deliberately inoculated with a drop (~10 µl, 106 CFU/ml water) of mycelial and spore suspension of A. solani on the dorsal surface of leaf and were kept in humid chamber until symptoms appeared (~3 days) or as mentioned in individual experiments. Control or mock inoculated plants received only a drop of water as inoculum and maintained under similar condition.2.2. Biochemical assaysPlant leaflets cut from their petiolule were immersed in alcoholic lactophenol (1:1:1:1 ratio of phenol:glycerol:lactic acid:water and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol) and warmed gently to remove the chlorophyll. The dechlorophyllized leaves were rinsed with water and stained with 0.01% toluidine blue solution in 150-mM disodium phosphate buffer (pH 9.5) for 30 min in dark. Leaves were then stained with 0.01% aniline blue for another 30 min in dark, and samples were observed under fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Axioskop 40 FL) with an excitation and emission wavelengths of 470 and 515 nm, respectively.Leaf sections (~0.5 cm2) encompassing the fungal inoculation site were used. The leaf cuttings were gently vacuum-infiltrated with 10 mM DAF-2DA dissolved in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 1 h. Fluorescence of the tissues was monitored under a fluorescent microscope (excitation/emission are 495/515 nm).Detection of intracellular ROS, particularly hydrogen peroxide, using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was performed. Leaflets cut at their petiolule were incubated in DAB staining solution (DAB at 1 mg/ml of 10 mM Na2HPO4), in dark, overnight at 28°C with constant agitation. DAB staining solution was replaced with bleaching solution (ethanol:acetic acid:glycerol = 3:1:1) and incubated in boiling water for 10–15 min to get rid of chlorophyll, the process was repeated till all of the chlorophyll was bleached away, and then the leaflets were visualized under white light and photographed.2.3. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)Infected and control tomato leaves were cut into ~1-cm2 size pieces and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.2-M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C. After rinsing the samples in same buffer, they were dehydrated in increasing concentration of ethanol (50, 70, 85 and 95%) for 30 min in each solution and were kept in absolute ethanol until attaching on SEM stubs. The prepared specimens were directly examined in a SEM (FEI Quanta 200 FEG MKII) at 5–10 kV.2.4. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisVisible fungal mass and dead tissues from the Alternaria-infected leaves were gently removed and samples (~300 mg) were collected only from the infected zone. Total RNA was prepared from both infected and mock-inoculated (control) leaves by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was resolved in a 0.8% denaturing formaldehyde gel to check its integrity. Only high-quality RNA was used for downstream processing. Typically, 3 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFischer scientific) and random hexamer primer at 42°C for 60 min. cDNA was stored at -20°C if not immediately used.2.5. Real time PCR analysisOnly 2.5% of the cDNA reaction mix was used as template in each 20 µl reaction containing SYBR green PCR mix (Thermo Scientific) and gene specific primers (0.2 µM each). PCR and analysis were performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST machine. For each sample of cDNA three replicates were analysed. Data were normalized based on the expression level of EF1a transcripts. Amplification of specific products were confirmed by obtaining a single peak in melt curve analysis, first derivative of fluorescence (dF/dT) vs temperature plot and by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose-TAE gel) of PCR end-products. Relative expression levels of transcripts were determined using the 2-<U+0394><U+0394>cT method. All experiments were repeated with three independent RNA preparations.2.6. Small RNA library preparation and sequencingTotal RNA for NGS was isolated following the method as mentioned above. Integrity of RNA (RIN >7) was further assessed using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) on an RNA 6000 Nanochip. These RNAs were also subjected to RT-PCR based analysis for detection of fungal RNA contamination using A. solani-specific primers for AltA1, GAPDH genes and ITS sequence (Supplementary Table S10). Small RNA libraries for sequencing were constructed using 1 µg of total RNA, according to the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA library preparation protocol (Illumina, USA). In brief, after adapter ligation at both ends the ligated products were reverse transcribed with Superscript II Reverse transcriptase (RT) by priming with adapter-specific RT-primers, PCR amplified and 140–190-bp size fragments were gel purified. The purified high-quality cDNA library was sequenced (Genotypic Pvt. Ltd., India) on an Illumina Genome AnalyserIIx (GAIIx).2.7. Small RNA analysisHigh-quality reads (Q-phred =30) obtained from four different samples (Controls 1 and 2, Infected 1 and 2, GEO accession: GSE75922) were subjected to adapter removal and size fractionation to collect only 18–25 nt reads. Probable fungal miRNA contaminants were discarded. Remaining reads were Blast searched against annotated plant miRNAs gathered from miRBase (release 21), Tomato Functional Genomics Database (TFGD) and Tomato genomics resources database (TGRD) to obtain the known miRNAs. Alignments with no gap and =2 mismatches between the query sequences and known miRNAs (subject) were only considered. The identified miRNAs were grouped into families based on sequence similarity. The reads which did not match to any known miRNAs were further processed to discover novel miRNAs using Mireap v0.2 software. Deseq was used to obtain the differentially expressed miRNAs. Outline of the analysis pipeline and a detailed protocol are presented in Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 and Supplementary Document S1.2.8. Preparation of DNA oligonucleotide probesAbout 10 pmol of DNA oligo was used for end labelling with 15 U of T4 PNK (NEB) and 40 µCi <U+03B3>-32P-ATP (BRIT, India) in a total volume of 15 µl according to enzyme manufactures (NEB) protocol. The labelled probes were then purified using illustraTM MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Health care), and specific activity was determined after scintillation counting of the purified probe. Probes with specific activity of about 20 × 107 cpm/µg oligo was routinely obtained and used in subsequent applications.2.9. Northern blot hybridization analysis of miRNAsTotal RNA, 40 µg per sample was resolved in a 7-M urea/10% polyacrylamide/TBE gel at 80 V and transferred to nylon membrane HybondTM–XL (GE healthcare) using Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (TE 77 PWR, GE Healthcare Amersham™) at 150 V for 1 h. RNA was fixed using UV cross linker (UVC 500 UV Crosslinkers, GE Healthcare Amersham™) at 15,000 J/cm2 for 2 min. The membrane was incubated for 30 min in pre-hybridization buffer (50% Deionized formamide, 5× SSPE buffer, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 0.5% SDS, supplemented with 0.02 mg/ml denatured Salmon sperm DNA) at 42°C, and then hybridization with <U+03B3>-32P labelled DNA oligo (~20 × 106 cpm) in the same prehybridization buffer was carried out in a heat seal bag by incubating overnight at 42°C with occasional shaking. Membrane was washed using a standard protocol, exposed to phosphor screen and image was captured at 100 µm pixel in Typhoon Trio+ (GE healthcare).2.10. Detection of miRNA by polyadenylation-mediated PCRSmall RNA population from total RNA was enriched using PureLink® miRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quality was examined by estimating the integrity of tRNA band loaded in denaturing 7% urea PAGE gel. 500 ng of small RNA was polyadenylated, and reverse transcribed to cDNA according to the protocol of NCode™ VILO™ miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Desired miRNA was amplified from the cDNA pool by using mature miRNA-specific forward primer and universal qPCR reverse primer provided in the kit. Relative intensity of the U6 snRNA-specific product band or tRNA band in the same amount of small RNA samples that were resolved in a urea-PAGE gel was monitored as normalizing factor.2.11. mRNA library construction, Illumina sequencing and transcriptome data analysisTotal RNA from Control 1 and Infected 1 samples were also used for mRNA library preparation and sequencing (Illumina Genome AnalyserIIx) according to the Illumina TruSeq RNA library protocol (Supplementary Document 1). The paired end raw reads were quality checked using SeqQC (a proprietary tool developed in Genotypic Technology Pvt. Ltd, India) and processed by Genotypic in-house script for adapters and low-quality bases trimming towards 3'-end. Sequence files are deposited in GEO database under the accession number GSE75923. Tophat-2.0.72 and Cufflinks-2.0.14 tools were used for assembling transcripts and estimating their abundances. Data were normalized as fragments mapped per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped. Cuffdiff (included in the cufflinks package) was used to find significant changes in transcript expression. Outline of the analysis pipeline is presented in Supplementary Fig. S3. Transcripts having log2 Fold Change (log2FC) at least ±1 and P =  0.05 were used for further analysis.2.12. Gene Ontology (GO) and the KEGG pathway annotation of Alternaria responsive transcriptsThe differentially expressed mRNAs were subjected to GO terms and pathway enrichment analyses. The GO terms were extracted for the regulated genes from Sol Genomics Network (SGN) ITAG2.4.go.csv. GO term enrichment was done using Cytoscape plugin: BiNGO of Cytoscape v3.2.1 software with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) setting of =0.05. BlastKOALA was used for K number assignment to the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using SSEARCH computation against a non-redundant set of KEGG genes, so that the gene could be put under a pathway. Pathway enrichment was done in a similar manner as for GO using Cytoscape v3.2.1 using the same parameters.2.13. Prediction of miRNA targetsTwo different softwares were used to predict the putative targets of differentially expressed known and novel miRNA candidates. The putative target sites of miRNA candidates were identified by aligning the miRNA sequences with tomato unigene library, using the plant small RNA Target Analysis Server, psRNATarget, with default parameters except a more relaxed cut-off threshold (5.0) of maximum expectation for higher prediction coverage. In addition to it, we used target prediction function of TFGD with default parameters to predict the putative targets. Expression levels of targets were taken from list of differentially expressed mRNAs identified in our mRNA transcriptome data analysis. GO terms were assigned to these targets using the similar method that has been utilized for assigning terms to DEGs as described in previous section.2.14. Target cleavage validation by using modified 5'RLM RACETotal RNA from tomato leaves were isolated, an RNA adapter was directly ligated to 3 µg of RNA using T4 RNA ligase (NEB). RNA was reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) with random hexamers. To amplify RACE products, first PCR was done with 1% of the RT reaction. Initial PCR reactions were done with an adaptor primer and complementary gene specific primers (Supplementary Table S10). PCR cycles were 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 45 s for 35 cycles. The nested PCRs were performed on 2.5 µl of initial reactions with the nested adaptor primer and complementary gene-specific internal primers. The resulting PCR products were gel purified, cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced.2.15. StatisticsEach RNA sample for NGS was obtained from multiple leaves collected from different plants. Except radioactive-based assays, in all other experiments at least three different plants of same age group were used. Three different RNA preparations were used for real-time PCR analysis; reactions were also done in triplicates. Q-PCR results are expressed as means ± standard error (SE). Two-tail Student’s t-test was used and P < 0.05 was considered significant for RT-PCR-based differential gene expression analysis.3. Results3.1. Plant infection and disease characterizationLeaves of tomato plants were inoculated with A.solani using droplet inoculation method, and chlorosis around the inoculums appeared within 24 h post-inoculation (hpi now onwards) followed by the development of typical blight symptoms at 72 hpi (Fig. 1A). Leaves were succumbed to the disease within 120 hpi. To confirm the disease establishment and to decide on the time of sampling for RNA preparation we did light microscopic, SEM and multiple biochemical assays, followed by analysis of the expression level of stress-related marker genes. Microscopic studies have confirmed fungal invasion through stomatal openings (Fig. 1B). Assays for detection of callose, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accretion indicated that all three showed maximum accretion from 48 to 96 hpi with a peak at 72 hpi (Fig. 1C–E). Further analysis of expression level of pathogenesis-related PR1b and Chitinase genes (Fig. 1F) also showed significant up-regulation occurred during this time. Positive results in biochemical assays for callose deposition, ROS and NO generation together with up-regulated expression of PR1b and chitinase confirmed disease establishment and significant progression within 72 hpi. Hence, RNA was isolated from tomato leaves infected for ~72 h for further analyses.Symptoms in deliberately infected tomato leaves, and characterization of the disease progression.

Differential expression of diverse sRNA population is associated with Alternaria-infection in tomatoOnly high-quality RNAs devoid of detectable fungal RNA contamination were used for library construction. Four small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced using NGS system to investigate the expression of small RNAs in tomato upon Alternaria stress. A total of 18.5, 11, 13.4 and 9.8 million reads ranging in size from 16 to 36 nt were retrieved from Control 1, Control 2, Infected 1 and Infected 2 libraries, respectively. After removing low-quality reads and adapter trimming, the remaining reads were size filtered from 18 to 25 nt to enrich the sample with reads corresponding to the size of typical miRNAs. These filtered sequences represented 1,009,952 (Control 1), 1,163,133 (Control 2), 636,784 (Infected 1) and 218,018 (Infected 2) unique sequences (Supplementary Table S1).The small RNA length distribution among the four libraries showed maximum reads in the size range of 21–24 nt (65.86 and 75.17% for total and unique reads, respectively, in the average of four samples) which corresponds to typical dicer-derived products (Supplementary Fig. S4). In total reads 24 nt sRNAs dominated the sRNA transcriptome in a control plant which is consistent with the typical size distribution of sRNAs found in other plants.4,5 However, in infected plants, total reads of 21 nt sRNAs increased (average 16.4 vs. 23.5% in control vs. infected), and the 24-nt population decreased markedly (average 24.8 vs. 14.5% in control vs. infected) (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Among the unique reads, the majority of sRNAs were 24 nt in length (39.08%, average of four samples) followed by 23 nt, however, 21 and 22-nt long reads were comparatively equally distributed (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Distribution of 24 vs. 21 nt unique reads in control vs. infected plants also followed the similar pattern as in total reads. In addition, the 21 and 22 nt class sRNAs showed the highest redundancy, whereas the 24-nt class showed the lowest redundancy (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B).3.3. Both conserved and species-specific microRNAs are Alternaria-stress responsive in tomatoThe cleaned and size fractionated reads acquired above were used in BlastN search against a collection of all the annotated plant miRNAs, obtained from multiple databases comprising miRBase (Release 21), TFGD and TGRD. On the basis of sequence similarity (minimum alignment length 18, maximum two mismatches and no gap), our analysis revealed 181 known miRNAs, which belonged to 121 miRNA families. Most of the identified miRNAs belonged to Solanaceae-specific families (75/121 families). Others (24/121 families) were conserved miRNAs for a plant, while few were reported from a specific plant species only (Supplementary Fig. S5).We analysed the identified families and found that they included a varying number of miRNA members. All miRNA families with at least five raw read counts for a member in at least one sample have been listed in Supplementary Table S2. Among the conserved miRNAs detected, the miR156 family was the largest, having seven members that were distinguished by the specific differences in their nucleotide sequences, followed by other abundant miRNAs such as miR166, miR171and miR482 families comprising of six members each. MiR167 included five members and miR319, miR396, miR9471 and miR393 contained four members each. Of the remaining 112 miRNA families, 2 families included 3 members, 19 families contained 2 members each and rest 91 miRNA families were each represented by a single member only (Supplementary Table S2).The frequencies of miRNA reads in a family varied from 1 (miR5658, miR4414, miR7717, etc.) to 1,01,449 (miR166), indicating that miRNA families are expressed in a widely variable frequency within the tissue. Of all the identified miRNA families, 10 families were represented by more than 1,000 normalized reads in the tomato dataset (Supplementary Table S2). In addition to miR166, miR159 (50,644 reads) and miR398 (13,132 reads) were among the major abundant families in the library. On average in a control tomato plant about 6.62% of total miRNAs are represented by highly abundant family members. On the contrary, less than 10 reads were detected for species specific and many solanaceae-specific miRNAs such as miR9472, miR8032, miR5083 and miR1873, etc. (Supplementary Table S2). Analysis of the sequenced data also showed that the relative abundance of members of the miRNA families varied greatly (Supplementary Fig. S6, Supplementary Tables S3 and S4), suggesting differential expression from different miRNA genes of the same family in tomato contributed to the final number of a mature miRNA produced in the tissue.miRNAs with at least five raw read counts from two equivalent libraries were selected for further analysis to determine differentially expressed miRNAs between Alternaria-treated and mock-treated samples using DEseq. Out of 181 identified miRNAs, 100 were differentially expressed. Next, to identify miRNAs that were notably changed in expression level after infection, we applied another selection criterion of log2FC to be at least ±1. This stringent selection yielded 67 differentially expressed miRNAs, and that the majority of them (44 out of 67) were down-regulated (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table S5). Among the differentially regulated miRNAs, sly-miR9524, sly-miR397 and sly-miR9513 were highly down-regulated with a log2FC values of -4.99 (P = 0.04), -4.39 (P = 0.01) and -4.08 (P = 0.02), respectively, and sly-miR482a, sly-miR8175 and sly-miR6300 were highly up-regulated with log2FC values of 3.13 (P = 0.04), 3.28 (P =0.05) and 2.65 (P= 0.01), respectively (Fig. 2B).Differentially expressed miRNAs between Alternaria infected and mock-treated tomato plants.

Several novel and previously uncharacterized miRNAs are also differentially expressed during Alternaria-infectionWe next inquired whether this cultivar of tomato also expressed any novel or previously uncharacterized miRNAs. Approximately 2,582,051 unannotated sequences (accumulated from four samples), not matching to known miRNAs or any other ncRNA such as tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and repeats, were aligned to the tomato genome (Sol Genomics Network). The reads aligned to tomato genome were used as input in the miRNA prediction software Mireap to obtain the putative novel miRNAs with their predicted hairpin precursors. To further increase the confidence of claiming the identified sequences as novel miRNAs, we applied the three Ambros criteria with slight modification. In addition, a sequence with minimum five read counts in at least one sample was taken for novel miRNA analysis. We, thus, recognized 60 potential novel miRNA candidates from all 4 samples (Supplementary Table S6). To further confirm precursor stem loop structure of these predicted novel miRNAs, the putative precursor sequence was subjected to folding analysis using RNAfold software. All these novel miRNA candidates’ precursor sequences were folded into a hairpin-like structure apparently similar to other known miRNAs (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S7). Moreover, the miRNA* of eight miRNAs were readily detected in our dataset. The precursor sequence of these new miRNA candidates varied from 63 to 101 nt in length and the MFE of precursor hairpins ranged from -25 to -50 kcal/mol. Of the 60 new miRNAs 52 are situated in the intergenic region, and 8 are located in the intronic regions of genes (Supplementary Table S6). The mature novel miRNAs could be found in both 5' and 3' arms of the predicted precursors and their read number varied from 1 to 20,631. However, some of these candidates could not be detected in all samples.Predicted precursor structure and validation of expression of novel miRNAs.

Among the differentially expressed novel miRNAs, 52 miRNAs had log2FC at least ±1. Among these, 39 and 13 were down and up-regulated, respectively, and only 7 novel miRNAs were found to be significantly (P = 0.05) differentially expressed (Supplementary Table S7). Both known and novel miRNAs expression data showed a majority of the differentially expressed miRNAs to be down-regulated as a response to Alternaria-stress.3.5. Differential expressions of both known and novel miRNAs could be validated using alternative techniquesTo validate the expression pattern of selected miRNAs, having at least 10 reads in any sample, we performed Poly A tailing mediated miRNA-amplification and northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). The highly up-regulated miRNAs, sly-miR482b, sly-miR168, sly-miR6300, sly-miR156f, sly-miR403-3p and sly-miR9519, and highly down-regulated miRNAs, sly-miR408b-3p, sly-miR398a-3p, sly-miR397 and sly-miR9513 were selected for testing along with sly-miR156a/b, sly-miR159, sly-miR4376, sly-miR166 and sly-miR6024 which were not significantly differentially expressed.Validation of expression level of miRNAs using alternative approaches.

(B) Images of northern blot hybridization analysis of selected known miRNAs. (C) Quantification of band intensity obtained (using ImageQuant ID GEL quantification software) in northern blot analysis (n = 2). Data presented as log2 fold change (normalized intensity of infected/control).PolyA tailing semiquantitative PCR (n = 3) analysis showed that out of 11 miRNAs tested 8 were differentially expressed (Fig. 4A). Northern blot analyses (n = 2) (Fig. 4B) indicated that expression of most of the miRNAs tested (10/12 miRNAs) matched with the trend of regulation observed in NGS analysis, however, the extent of regulation differed (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. S8). Noticeable difference in expressions of sly-miR156a/b, sly-miR397, sly-miR482b, sly-miR159, sly-miR168 and sly-miR156f were also observed. Two conserved miRNAs, miR159 and miR156a/b, which did not fulfil log2FC criteria (at least ±1) in NGS analysis showed considerable alteration in expression in Northern blot analysis.Next, we investigated whether the expression level of certain miRNAs was also dependent on the infection progression. Samples from different time points post infection (8–72 hpi) were collected for Northern blot analysis. Visible difference in expression of miRNAs tested was apparent only at 72 hpi (Supplementary Fig. S9). Expressions of miR168 and miR403 were upregulated, whereas the expression of miR397 was downregulated and the changes observed at 72 hpi are similar to NGS as well as to poly-A tailing mediated RT-PCR validation analyses. Thus the expression of these miRNAs was regulated only during the development of blight symptom.We selected four novel miRNAs (Fig. 3A) for validation of their expression. These miRNAs had at least 10 raw read counts, and miRNA* sequence of three of these miRNAs (sly-miRPR11, sly-miRPR26 and sly-miRPR29) could be detected in the NGS data. Using Northern blot analysis (n = 2), sly-miRPR1, sly-miRPR26 and sly-miRPR29 could be detected in both the samples (Fig. 3B). The novel miRNAs, sly-miRPR11, sly-miRPR26 and sly-miRPR29 with detectable star sequences, were also subjected to PolyA tailing mediated RT-PCR analysis for further validation. All three were readily detected in both the samples and sly-miRPR29 exhibited significant change in expression level during the infection (Fig. 3C) which is similar to the pattern observed in NGS analysis. Also, expression of probable precursor sequences of two of these novel miRNAs (sly-miRPR11 and sly-miRPR29) was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis performed with RNAs from both control and infected plants (Fig. 3D).3.6. Genes belonging to stress-related pathways are targeted by differentially expressed miRNAsmiRNAs mediate their function in the cell by triggering cleavage or translational inhibition of specific target mRNAs, with which it has sequence complementarity. We searched two online databases psRNATarget and TFGD, to find predicted targets of 67 differentially expressed known miRNAs. The databases predicted 7,025 putative targets cumulatively (6,576 miRNA–mRNA pairs in psRNATarget and 1,055 pairs in TFGD, 606 common between the two). The discrepancy in the number of targets predicted by two softwares was due to the difference in the scoring matrix of the two databases. To better understand the group of genes targeted by the differentially expressed miRNAs during Alternaria stress, GO-based functional annotation and enrichment analysis of the predicted targets were performed utilizing Hypergeometric test applying Benjamini & Hochberg FDR correction value =0.05, with all predicted targets. Under the molecular function category of the GO classification, genes showing kinase activity (GO:0016301), receptor activity (GO:0004872), transferase activity (GO:0016740), transporter activity (GO:0005215), ATPase activity (GO:0016887), catalytic activity (GO:0003824), oxidoreductase activity (GO:0016724), signal transducer activity (GO:0004871) were highly enriched as targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs. Under the biological process category genes involved in cell death (GO:0008219), RNA metabolic process (GO:0016070), tRNA processing (GO:0008033) were targeted by miRNAs and only thylakoid membrane related genes were found to be enriched for the cellular component category as targets (Supplementary Fig. S10). In further analysis of the 606 target mRNAs simultaneously predicted by both software, no specific pathway was enriched, however, ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, ‘biosynthesis of amino acids’ and ‘carbon metabolism’ pathways are highlighted, as more genes of these pathways seem to be targeted. It is worth mentioning that some amino acids are precursors of phytohormones and it has been noted earlier that hormone biosynthesis/signalling pathways were affected during the infection.3.7. mRNA expression profiles in tomato in response to Alternaria stressIn order to detect the alteration in expression of genes during Alternaria-stress RNA-seq analysis was performed for two tomato cDNA libraries, Control 1 and Infected 1, constructed with the same RNA preparation that has been used for small RNA transcriptomics. Sequencing generated 75.92 and 78.34 million reads, and after removing the low-quality reads (<20 Phred score) and trimming off the adapter sequences, 70.27 and 72.56 million clean reads remained for Control 1 and Infected 1 samples, respectively. Mean read length obtained was 99 bp (maximum and minimum were 100 and 50 bp). The sequenced reads were aligned to the tomato reference genome (Sol Genomics Network), which showed 81.23 and 80.85% matched sequences for Control 1 and Infected 1 libraries, respectively. Next, these sequences were assigned to transcripts and a total of 23,011 and 22,997 assembled transcripts (identified by their respective gene ID) from Control 1 and Infected 1 samples, respectively, were obtained (Supplementary Table S8). Finally, differential gene expression analysis revealed 5,450 genes showed at least 2-fold change in expression level (P = 0.05). This analysis also revealed that relatively more genes were up-regulated (52.53%) compared with 47.46% genes which were down-regulated (Supplementary Fig. S11, Supplementary Table S9). These DEGs were subjected to further analysis to identify the pathways they were representing.3.8. Validation of mRNA transcriptome analysis dataTo validate the NGS expression data, we randomly selected 18 differentially expressed mRNAs (log2FC at least ±1, P = 0.05) and validated their relative expression levels with qRT-PCR, using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S10). Data presented in Fig. 5A show that 17 mRNAs were differentially expressed and the expression pattern matched with NGS data analysis, however, the extent of differential expression differed.Experimental validation of expression level of selected genes.

(B) Pearson correlation scatter plot of comparisons of differential expression level as measured by NGS analysis (log2FC) and experimentally validated data (log2FC) for mRNAs and miRNAs. ‘r’ indicates the Pearson correlation coefficient.3.9. Correlation of NGS analysis and validation dataThe intensity of bands in miRNA Northern blots was determined using ImageQuant ID GEL quantification software, from which normalized fold change in expression of miRNAs was derived. Fold change values of mRNA expression from quantitative RT-PCR analysis was also collected. Correlation between the relative expression level detected by these validated data and NGS sequencing data were then calculated. We obtained a highly significant Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.84 (Fig. 5B), which strongly supported that our NGS transcriptome data were valid.3.10. Functional and pathway annotation of Alternaria–stress responsive transcriptsTo better understand the function of the DEGs (P = 0.05), GO terms and pathway enrichment analyses (KEGG analysis) were performed. We found that 3,154 genes were involved with 17 major molecular functions, 62 genes were part of 3 different cellular components and 57 genes participated in 1 biological process (Supplementary Fig. S12A). The GO terms predominantly enriched midst the regulated genes were related to molecular function including ‘catalytic activity’ (GO:0003824), ‘transferase activity’ (GO:0016740) ‘kinase activity’ (GO:0016301), ‘oxidoreductase activity’ (GO:0016491) represented by 1382, 539, 265 and 272 DEGs. Among the ‘kinase activity’ group majority belonged to ‘protein kinase activity’ (GO:0004672, 211 genes), and ‘transferase activity’ group had majority genes belonged to ‘transferring phosphorous-containing groups’ (GO:0016772, 283 genes). Other GO terms that were enriched including ‘transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity’ (GO:0019199), ‘transmembrane receptor activity’ (GO:0004888), ‘receptor activity’ (GO:0004872), ‘chitinase activity’ (GO:0004568), ‘lipoxygenase activity’ (GO:0016165), ‘oxygen binding’ (GO:0019825), ‘antioxidant activity’ (GO:0016209) are related to pathways involved in a stress response. Genes associated with ‘extracellular region’ (GO:0005576), ‘photosystem’ (GO:0009521) and ‘thylakoid’ (GO:0009579) were most significant (represented by 30, 18 and 9 genes, respectively) among the cellular component GO terms. In the GO biological process class, there was a higher number of DEGs annotated to ‘response to stimulus’ (GO:0050896, 63 genes), more specifically ‘response to biotic stimulus’ (GO:0009607, 14 genes).To elucidate the exact biological processes the DEGs may participate in during Alternaria stress, we analysed the allotment of a DEG to a particular KEGG pathway. We were able to allot 5,080 genes in 334 different pathways. Next, we performed enrichment analysis, which revealed 24 important pathways were significantly (P = 0.05) enriched in response to Alternaria stress (Supplementary Fig. S12B). It was noticeable that genes associated with photosynthesis particularly photosynthesis–antenna proteins (PATH:ko00196) were significantly enriched among the DEGs, suggesting plant photosynthesis is affected during infection owing to the chlorosis and blight progression during the disease. In addition, genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (PATH: ko01110) and phenylpropanoids (PATH:ko00940), unsaturated fatty acids, zeatin, flavonoid, cutin suberin and wax, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol and steroids were enriched. Moreover, genes for metabolism of phenylalanine, porphyrin and chlorophyll, nitrogen, linoleic and alpha–linoleic acid and starch and sucrose were enriched. Also, DEGs involved in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, or apoptosis were enriched. And lastly, plant–pathogen interaction (PATH: ko04626) and plant hormone signal transduction (PATH: ko04075) pathways were enriched, signifying, substantial regulation of genes contributing in the modulation of plant hormone signalling and plant defence occurred during the infection.3.11. Differential expression of pathogenesis/disease development-related genes occur during Alternaria-stressA close inspection of genes belonging to a particular pathway that were differentially regulated during the infection revealed that genes, (i) involved in plant hormone biosynthesis/signal transduction for auxin, ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were regulated, (ii) for ROS or NO generation/scavenging were significantly regulated and (iii) which may have direct role in stress response such as RLKs, NB–LRRs and WRKY transcription factors were also significantly regulated (Supplementary Table S9 and Supplementary Fig. S13).Usually, necrotrophic pathogens are benefitted from SA-mediated hypersensitive response due to added cell death, and in a resistance response, SA pathway is down regulated. Isochorismate synthase is a major gene in SA biosynthetic process, which is usually upregulated during a resistance response to a necrotrophic pathogen infection and systemic acquired resistance, however, it was downregulated (log2FC = -2.5, although not P significant) in our compatible interaction study. Concomitantly, several Phenylalanine ammonia–lyase (PAL) genes, of the SA–biosynthesis secondary pathway, were significantly upregulated together with the expression of pathogenesis-related PR-1, and PR-5 (log2FC= +6.19 and log2FC = +5.49, respectively) genes. These data support the view that SA-mediated defence pathway was suppressed in this compatible interaction. Although a role of PAL genes in this process is unclear, probably SA-mediated cell death would still occur as these genes’ expression was increased, which might benefit the fungus during this susceptible interaction.14During necrotrophic pathogen infection, the plant’s defence response consists of synergistic activation of ET and JA pathways.15 In line with this, the majority of the genes associated with these pathways were noticeably upregulated. Out of 106 genes associated with the ET pathway that were recognized, 76 were upregulated including 34 genes responsible for ET biosynthesis (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) and 43 genes (out of 62) responsible for ET signal transduction (ethylene-responsive transcription factors, ERFs). Moreover, 16 genes (among 23 genes detected) involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis (Allene oxide cyclase and lipoxygenase) and signal transduction (Jasmonate ZIM domain, JAZ) were also found to be upregulated. Suggesting both ET and JA pathways were also activated as the host was continuously trying to resist the pathogen (Supplementary Fig. S13).The role of Auxin in a stress response has recently been appreciated, and the hormone’s role in Alternaria–stress response is found to be complicated. Auxin conjugating genes such as GH3.8 were both up and down regulated. On the other hand, a majority of the repressors of auxin signalling pathway including Aux/IAA1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 were significantly downregulated, indicating the onset of Auxin signalling also occurred during the infection. We have also noticed that one of the marker genes for auxin signalling pathway, proteinase inhibitor II (Pin2), was markedly upregulated (log2FC = +10.03), supporting the view of activation of auxin signalling pathway during Alternaria-infection in tomato. However, 75% of the auxin effector genes SAUR were down-regulated. Therefore, a detailed analysis is required to comprehend the exact role of auxin in this process.In plant defence response, ROS and NO are thought to regulate programmed cell death through the establishment of the hypersensitive reaction.16 Genes related to ROS generation/scavenging systems were highly upregulated including respiratory burst oxidase (RBOH), peroxidise (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), nitric oxide reductase, glutathione s transferase, ascorbate peroxidase. In addition, two classes of detoxifying genes UDP-glycosyltransferase (UDPG) (36/66 genes) and ABC transporters (17/25 genes) were upregulated many folds, probably to detoxify toxins generated by A.solani. Regarding ABA signalling, Out of seven ABA receptors showing differential expression, six depicted highly elevated expression, suggesting, ABA-signalling was also activated.The sensors of Ca2+ flux in plants in response to stress, including 16 calmodulin-like protein (CAM), calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPKs), 2 CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) were upregulated many folds, however, membrane proteins like sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX), Calcium/proton exchanger are down-regulated, implying calcium accumulation is favoured within the cell which may serve as a second messenger in host to activate downstream gene regulation.There were 183 DEGs that were different kinds of transcription factors (TFs), such as the WRKY family (i.e. WRKY16, 23, 29, 30, 37, 27, 73), ERF family (i.e. ERF2, 1b,1a, 2a,7,10), NAC, basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, GRAS family, basic helix loop helix (bHLH) family and heat stress transcription factor (HSF), and master regulator myeloblastosis protein (MYB) family. Among these DEGs almost all the WRKY transcription factors were found to be upregulated (35/36 genes), ERF (43/63), NAC (25/38), MYB (36/54) and HSF (5/6) followed the same trend. However, the majority of the genes belonging to the bHLH group of transcription factor were found to be down-regulated (23/31).Plant transmembrane receptor-like kinases (RLKs), receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) genes are surveyors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and effector molecules for initiating stress signalling. Very interestingly, 219/326 significantly differentially regulated such genes were upregulated, indicating active signalling was prevalent inside the infected tissues. It will be intriguing to decipher the role of highly differentially regulated disease resistance related NB-LRR genes in the EB disease biology.3.12. Combined expression analysis of miRNAs and cognate target mRNAs confirms pathogenesis/disease development-related genes are majorly targeted during Alternaria–tomato compatible interactionWe integrated our miRNA and mRNA sequencing data to get relative expression level of miRNA–mRNA pairs. To impose more stringency in the analysis we have considered only 606 common targets, among these 450 could be detected in our transcriptome analysis. We have further filtered these possible targets based on predetermined cut-off value of log2FC at least ±1 (P = 0.05) in the transcriptome dataset and obtained 202 target genes. 102 (50.4%) among these showed significant opposite expression level compared with the expression of cognate miRNA (Supplementary Table S11). The oppositely regulated targets included (i) signalling/sensor molecules such as calmodulin binding protein (Solyc02g079040) and 14 NB-LRR disease resistance genes, 13 of them were cc–nbs–lrr type, (ii) transcription factors including MYB, Squamosa promoter binding like (SBP), AP2-ethylene-responsive and GRAS family, (iii) Nucleoredoxin 2 (Solyc05g005460), a thioredoxin-disulfide reductase and a Glutaredoxin family protein (Solyc08g082590) which might have role in oxidation-reduction process, (iv) multiple RLKs and RLPs and (v) genes related to ubiquitination process such as U-box (Solyc05g008230) and F-box proteins (Solyc01g106510) (Supplementary Table S11). However, it must be noted here that we are considering only genes which are likely to be cleaved by miRNAs, apart from this, translational inhibition of gene expression by miRNAs is also important, which could not be accounted in the present analysis.Further, filtering of the targets using more stringent target prediction criteria, such that the target and the miRNA have almost perfect complementarity throughout its length, we obtained a list of 15 stringent miRNA–mRNA pairs showing opposite expression pattern during Alternaria–stress (Fig. 6A). Tomato degradome analysis data (Supplementary Table S11) confirmed nine of these interactions, and our 5'-RLM RACE analysis also confirmed some of these interactions during stress (Fig. 6B, Supplementary Fig. S14). The majority of these targets has roles in stress-related gene or pathway regulation, suggesting miRNA-mediated regulation of transcriptome is an essential process in Alternaria–stress response in tomato.Scheme showing some of the key Alternaria-responsive miRNAs and their targets in tomato.

Discussion4.1. miRNAs in Alternaria-disease biologyRecent publications have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in plant defence. The advent of NGS technique has expanded the list of miRNAs discovered in plant and their differential expression in different plants exposed to various biotic stresses. These studies also include analysis of tomato miRNA regulation during biotrophic pathogen interaction, such as tomato–cucumber mosaic virus and tomato-ToLCNDV17; and necrotrophic interactions, such as tomato-Botrytis cineria4 and tomato-Fusarium.18 Essential role of tomato miRNAs targeting NB-domain protein in conferring resistance to Fusarium fungal attack18 has been established. However, which miRNAs and genes are precisely regulated during Alternaria-stress in tomato was not known. Hence in this study, we adopted high throughput sequencing approaches to performing a combined expression profiling analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs in the same sample to provide an enhanced understanding of potential miRNA regulatory network in tomato subjected to Alternaria-stress. In fact, an extensive search of databases only yielded one reference related to whole transcriptome analysis during plant–pathogen interaction, describing small RNA and mRNA transcriptome during rice–RSV interaction.11 Thus, comprehensive study of the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles and correlating miRNA–mRNA expression in tomato inoculated with and without A.solani is well timed.We initiated this study with the identification of the optimum stage of disease development which was selected for isolating total RNA. We considered following factors, (i) the disease should be progressed sufficiently, (ii) the tissue should not be completely blighted as these tissues will contain more dead cells and degraded RNA and (iii) the plant should show prominent biochemical or molecular response towards the disease, as it will indicate activation of signalling components. Our observations prompted us to use leaves of stage 3 (~72 hpi) of the disease (Fig. 1A). The tissues indeed showed heightened expression of marker genes, PR1b and Chitinase, for biotic stress response (Fig. 1F), confirming appropriate diseased samples were used for comparison purpose. Concurrently, we had ensured that (i) high-quality of RNA were used, (ii) no fungal RNA contaminated our samples and (iii) only high-quality sequence reads were analysed with sufficient stringency wherever required.The recent publications on tomato miRNA transcriptome analysis also described a number of conserved and novel miRNAs, however, it is difficult to combine all these information to make a comprehensive database for comparison purpose. In the miRBase, only a few miRNAs are listed as originated from tomato. Thus to eliminate the probability of excluding any significant miRNA from our analysis, we have gathered information about all plant-specific miRNAs available in the miRBase, and tomato miRNAs in TFGD and TGRD databases for making a comprehensive list of miRNAs. This list was used for the identification of miRNAs in our dataset. A perfect match was named according to the name of the matching miRNA found in any of these databases; however, a miRBase match received the priority during naming. An unmatched but otherwise fulfilling pre-set criteria for identification of miRNAs was called as a novel miRNA, and its corresponding sRNA number was also looked for in the TFGD database. This arrangement has avoided unnecessary new naming of a miRNA with known sequence information and eased the tracking of already available information regarding the miRNAs identified here.Overall analysis of small RNA data revealed two interesting facts, (i) during the infection the total reads number of 21 nt sRNAs increased and 24-nt population decreased markedly (Supplementary Fig. S4) and (ii) tomato genome encodes more types of Solanaceae/species-specific miRNAs compared with conserved miRNAs (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S5). The heterochromatic siRNAs are 24-nt long, having a possible role in DNA methylation whereas miRNAs or secondary siRNAs are of 21 nt.19 Thus it will be interesting to investigate if the infection has caused reduced methylation at some specific loci leading to the expression of A.solani responsive genes.We have meticulously analysed the expression of each member of a miRNA family. Members to a family were assigned based on the sequence similarity among miRNAs and assumed minor mismatches might have aroused due to the expression from different precursor sequences, and different products that might have generated due to the irregular processing of the same precursor are placed in a same family-member group. We believe this is the best method for identifying a family and its members. However, we have also noticed that the numbers of designated family members differed from the numbers reported in previous studies,20,21 although some of the abundant expresser families (miR166, miR168, miR156, miR 6027) were also identified in these reports.The expression level of different members of the same miRNA family showed noticeable variation among them (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S4). Interestingly, upon infection the expression pattern of isoforms also altered within a family (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S4). Visible changes were noticed for miR167, miR171, miR393, miR319, miR397 and miR166 among the conserved miRNA families. In line with this observation, members of the miR166 family were found to have different expression pattern in wheat in response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress.5Differential miRNA expression analysis indicated that both conserved and Solanaceae-specific miRNAs were differentially regulated during Alternaria stress, which is analogous to observations with other plant–pathogen interaction studies.4,18,22,23 Our stringent analysis demonstrated that majority of miRNAs were down-regulated upon Alternaria-stress. Similar, down-regulation of the majority of miRNAs were observed in tomato–Phytophthora infestans,24 brinjal–Verticillium dahliae6 interactions. However, during Botrytis cinerea, CMV25 and Fusarium oxysporum18 stresses tomato plant responded by up-regulating majority of miRNAs. Hence, it seems the pattern of regulating the expression of miRNAs during stress is dependent on a specific plant and pathogen interaction, and thus it is difficult to generalize a rule of regulation of miRNAs during stress.Some recent studies conducted using different fungus and plants showed the importance of specific miRNAs in making a plant susceptible or resistant against a particular pathogen.4,18 miR166, miR169 and miR397 were reported to be down-regulated in susceptible soybean variety upon Phakopspora pachyrhizi infection.26 Our data showed that during tomato–Alternaria interaction miR169 and miR397 were down-regulated many fold but expression of miR166 was not regulated significantly. A close inspection of the miRNAs regulated as an effect of necrotrophic fungi Botrytis cinerea4 and A.solani (this study) in tomato we found that 13 miRNAs were commonly regulated by both the stresses in tomato. Eight miRNAs (sly-miR156d-3p, sly-miR6300, sly-miR156f, sly-miR482a, sly-miR482b, sly-miR160a and sly-miR168a/b were up-regulated and sly-miR396a-3p was down-regulated) showed similar trend of regulation among the two stresses, however, five miRNAs (sly-miR171e, sly-miR169b/d/e, sly-miR172a/b, sly-miR390a-5p and sly-miR399a) showed opposite regulation. A similar comparison of regulated miRNAs between biotrophic pathogen CMV-stress25 and Alternaria-stress in tomato showed 11 miRNAs to be differentially regulated in common. Among them, seven miRNAs showed the similar trend in regulation (sly-miR167c, sly-miR6024b, sly-miR168a/b were up-regulated, and sly-miR166k, sly-miR397, sly-miR408b-3p and miR395a/b were down-regulated in both the cases). However, remaining four miRNAs (sly-miR393a-3p, sly-miR390a-3p, sly-miR398a-3p and miR408b-5p) showed opposite regulation. Thus, it seems there are certain common response genes that are probably regulated by miRNAs during a biotic stress; however, the specific response is governed by regulation of a specific set of miRNAs, reinstating our previously stated notion.In addition to known miRNAs, 60 novel putative miRNAs were also discovered (Supplementary Table S6). The novel miRNAs are in general low expressing as compared with known miRNAs. Although we were able to validate the expression of four arbitrarily chosen putative novel miRNAs using alternative techniques, further experimentations are essential to declare them as real miRNAs. However, the precursors of at least two of these novel miRNAs (sly-miRPR11 and sly-miRPR29) were detectable and showed variable expression in infected tissues, thus it is safe to conclude that these two miRNAs are biologically active.4.2. Transcriptomics of EB diseased leavesProfiling of differentially expressed transcripts during Alternaria-stress, and subsequent functional and pathway enrichment analyses (Supplementary Fig. S12A and B) provided a comprehensive view of response regulators during the compatible interaction. We have also delved into more profiling details to find out (i) which GO terms are represented by up and downregulated genes, and (ii) the expression status of genes of an enriched pathway. These analyses provided an enhanced perspective to the overall expression data.Our data suggest that enriched GO-terms ‘chlorophyll binding’ and ‘tetrapyrrole binding’ were represented by down-regulated genes in the molecular function category. Under the cellular component category, the majority of the terms enriched were against down-regulated genes, which also included terms related to photosynthesis, more specifically photosystem reaction centre I and thylakoid. Moreover, pathway annotation also showed mostly down-regulated genes enriched the terms related to photosynthesis process, especially photosynthesis–antenna proteins, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and carbon fixation (Supplementary Fig. S12B), further supporting photosynthesis was severely affected during Alternaria stress, which could be explained by chlorosis and blight symptom owing to the disease. Other plants are also known to be affected by down-regulation of photosynthesis during a pathogen attack,7,27 however, this could help the plant to cope the stress.A biotic stress is perceived by the plant at the membrane, followed by initiation of a signalling cascade in which RLK, RLP and NB-LRR proteins play crucial roles, and subsequently, a set of stress-management-related genes are expressed. Our analysis suggested that multiple such proteins were differentially regulated. In line with this, the major categories that are GO-enriched and represented by mostly up-regulated genes belonged to ‘transferase activity’, ‘kinase activity’ and ‘catalytic activity’; and especially ‘phosphotransferase activity’ and ‘protein kinase activity’. This indicates, events like phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation increased in the cell during the stress, leading to the activation of various signalling intermediates thus altering signalling pathways. KO terms for plant pathogen interaction pathway have also been found to be enriched and represented by upregulated genes. These results prove that an active signalling cascade was primed during the stress. Accordingly, under biological process category terms related to response to stimuli and specifically biotic stimuli were enriched.The diseased plant responds by activation of genes that help in scavenging the toxins produced inside the tissues or by producing secondary metabolites that might check the pathogen growth to cope the stress. An important category which was enriched among the up-regulated genes was ‘glutathione transferase (GST) activity’. GSTs are known for their ability to detoxify toxins, protect a plant from oxidative stress and regulating cell proliferation and death by interfering with MAPK pathway.28,Alternaria-infection is associated with oxidative burst (Fig. 1), which could be induced by the necrotrophic pathogen to kill the cells, and cellular scavenging enzymes such as GSTs thus are activated to mitigate the stress. Upregulated genes were also involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways including phenylalanine and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway generates diverse kind of secondary metabolites which can protect plants against pathogens. Thus it can be inferred, an increase in the expression of genes responsible for phenylalanine metabolism is providing enough precursor (phenylalanine) for phenylpropanoid metabolism, which in turn forms basic units of many secondary metabolite biosynthesis.29 In summary, genes involved in three crucial pathways such as activation of, stress-signal transduction, cellular detoxification machinery and metabolic pathways including biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were altered upon Alternaria infection in tomato.4.3. Integrating miRNA–mRNA transcriptomicsWithin a cell, if the level of a miRNA increases, decreased level of the cognate target mRNA indicates increased cleavage activity of the miRNA, on the other hand, a decrease in the level of miRNA results in increased level of target mRNAs. Hence, a transcriptome-wide combined analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression level was carried out to identify the miRNA–mRNA pairs which were regulated during tomato–A.solani compatible interaction. This has enabled us to understand which pathways and biological processes of the cell were most likely regulated by miRNAs during the stress.We used considerably differentially expressed miRNAs to identify putative targets using two separate target prediction databases. A comparison between the GO-based functional enrichment of these predicted targets with the differentially expressed transcripts (Supplementary Figs. S10 and S12A) revealed the biological activities that were likely regulated by miRNAs during the stress. For example in both the analyses, (i) majority of the enriched genes were categorized under ‘molecular function’; (ii) activities like ‘catalytic’ and ‘transferase’ were most enriched, and (iii) ‘kinase activity’, ‘molecular transducer’, ‘signal transducer’ and ‘receptor activities’ were also substantially reflected. Such observations indicate that genes representing the above-mentioned ontologies are likely targeted by miRNAs. However, genes showing ‘oxidoreductase’, ‘UDP-glycosyltransferase’ and ‘oxygen binding’ activity were enriched only in regulated transcripts, indicating although genes involved in above processes were differentially expressed during Alternaria stress but this regulation was not due to the miRNA-mediated cleavage of transcripts. Similarly, ‘response to stimulus’ especially ‘response to biotic stimulus’ was enriched in the ‘biological process’ category only amid the regulated transcripts. On the contrary, ‘cell death’ and ‘RNA and ncRNA metabolism’ and ‘processing’ terms were enriched under the same category for the predicted targets only. These observations suggesting only a few specific biological processes were regulated by miRNAs during the stress.Under the ‘cellular component’, genes associated to thylakoid were common between the two analyses, but no genes related to photosynthesis was enriched among the predicted targets although photosynthetic pathway was found to be affected as a whole during Alternaria stress, implying photosynthetic genes are majorly regulated transcriptionally and may not be significantly affected by miRNA-mediated silencing pathway.During the infection ROS is overproduced (Fig. 1), thus we set out to detect whether genes related to ROS generation/scavenging pathway were indeed targets of miRNAs. Our analysis indicated that genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes and detoxification during oxidative stress were targeted by miRNAs and their expression was inversely correlated to that of targeting miRNAs, these include stu-miR398a-3p-Nucleoredoxin 2 (Solyc05g005460), sly-miR9518-glutaredoxin family protein (Solyc08g082590), sly-miR408b-3p-blue copper protein–plastocyanin (Solyc01g104400), sly-miR9474-5p-nudix hydrolase 2 (Solyc05g016690) and sly-miR169b-UDP-glucosyltransferase (Solyc06g062290).We were able to validate some of the predicted targets by analysing recently published tomato degradome NGS data21,30 and 5'-RACE analysis (Fig. 6b). Among 606 common predicted targets, we found 44 mRNAs to be cleaved at the exact position as predicted in our analysis. Next, a closer inspection of transcriptomics data showed that 38 miRNAs formed 102 miRNA–mRNA interaction pairs and showed opposite regulation (Supplementary Table S11). It was noticed that majority of the 102 oppositely expressed targets with respect to their cognate miRNA, could be clustered into specific groups including transcription factors, NB–LRRs and ubiquitination related proteins. NB–LRR–miRNA interactions have been well documented18,31 and F-box proteins are known targets of miR393 and miR394.32 As late infection inflicts massive cell death, it is imminent that cellular general metabolic processes will be largely affected. We have shown earlier that several metabolism-related GO-terms were enriched, and miRNA–mRNA paired expression analysis revealed some genes involved in the basic metabolism of cell like Phosphofructokinase family protein, Citrate synthase, Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, etc. were also targeted and expression was negatively affected (Supplementary Table S11).Further stringent analysis by imposing more selective criteria has led to the identification of specific genes that are most likely targeted by miRNAs (Fig. 6). Many of these interactions are also validated in independent studies18,21,30,33,34 (Supplementary Table S11, Fig. 6b). Hence, in this study key genes and miRNA regulators responsible for mediating Alternaria–stress response in tomato has been identified, and we have confirmed Alternaria-stress-related regulation of miRNA expression as one of the important regulatory events that occur to reprogramme gene expression cascade to cope the stress.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.This study was supported by a DBT grant to P.K.

IntroductionMicrosporidia are unicellular eukaryotic parasites divided into more than 187 genera and 1,500 distinct species of varying medical, veterinary and economic impacts.1 These highly-adapted, obligate intracellular pathogens were recently shown to cluster at the base of the fungal kingdom as a sister-group to chytrid pathogen Rozella allomycis.2 Unlike most of their fungal relatives however, Microsporidia cannot thrive without a host and can only survive in the outside environment as spores. The intracellular lifestyle of Microsporidia is obligate and likely irreversible, as all but one species (i.e. Mitosporidium daphniae)3 feature highly-reduced mitochondria known as mitosomes that are incapable of generating ATP via oxidative phosphorylation and gene-depleted nuclear genomes, reflecting a heavy host-dependence towards a large number of essential cellular components that they are no longer able to produce.4 Of the circa 1,800–2,600 proteins5 encoded in the microsporidian gene repertoire, a total of about 800 proteins form a reduced core set involved in critical cellular processes and pathogenicity, including spore formation, invasion and host-parasite relationships,4,6,7 with the remaining proteome postulated to reflect their adaptation to different niches.8 However, while recent investigations have painted a clearer picture of the microsporidian pan-proteome, we still know very little about the types and distribution of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are present in Microsporidia.In eukaryotic cells, three RNA polymerases (RNA Pol I, II and III) are involved in the transcription processes of ncRNAs. RNA Pol I is specialized in the high level synthesis of the large rRNA precursor from a single type promoter.9 RNA Pol III transcribes numerous ncRNAs, including tRNAs, 5S rRNA, and a variety of other types of ncRNA such as U6 snRNA, RNase P RNA and SRP RNA, by recognizing cis-acting elements located within the transcribed region.10 Finally, RNA Pol II, which transcribes protein-coding genes, is also devoted to the production of ncRNA such as other small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).11Non-coding RNAs are diverse and biologically relevant molecules involved in various crucial cellular processes.12–15 For example, snRNAs, snoRNAs and RNase ncRNAs are found in most eukaryotic cells and are involved in the splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, ribosome-related 2'-O-methylation (C/D snoRNA) or pseudouridylation (H/ACA snoRNA), and miscellaneous maturation processes, respectively. However, current ncRNA investigations are hampered by our limited prediction, detection and identification capabilities, which lag far behind those coding for proteins. Indeed, ncRNAs lack the signatures that make protein-coding gene prediction possible (e.g. codon usage, splicing signals, open reading frame length, sequence bias) and similarity searches are often inefficient due to the lack of primary sequence conservation across distantly related genomes.16,17 The most successful approaches to identify ncRNAs exploit the idea that functionally significant RNA secondary and/or tertiary structures will be conserved in distant species, as function is usually dependent on structure, and structures can be maintained despite high sequence divergence by compensatory mutations. Predicting consensus secondary/tertiary structures can thus be far more useful than alignments of closely related primary sequences when working across large evolutionary distances or with sequences displaying extremely fast rates of evolution, as is the case with most microsporidian genomes.18Most approaches currently used to identify ncRNAs start from the analysis of transcriptome data, which are then mapped onto genomic data.19 This circumscribes the scope of the search to a smaller subset of transcribed and therefore potentially functional sequences, a clear advantage when the genomes under scrutiny are huge. However, distinguishing between function and transcriptional noise can be difficult, and the tools that are available to process transcriptome data are still in flux. Here, we used instead the reverse approach, from genome prediction to transcriptome validation, to investigate the presence of ncRNAs in the genomes of Microsporidia from the four Encephalitozoon species. This approach is well-suited to Encephalitozoon genomes due to their extreme size reduction (smaller than 3 Mbp), high-levels of gene synteny and coding density, and characterized CCC-/GGG-like transcriptional initiation signals.6,20–22 Using this approach, we identified a total of ten new ncRNAs in the Encephalitozoon spp., including the previously missing U1 snRNA and nine snoRNA-like genes. Their presence and that of eight previously predicted ncRNAs were further confirmed by 5' and 3' RACE-PCR experiments in E. cuniculi. To strengthen the relevance of our comparative approach and to better evaluate the overall catalogue of ncRNA in microsporidian genomes, we also applied the same method to the available genomes from the genus Nosema. Most of the ncRNA found in the four Encephalitozoon species were also identified in Nosema spp. This suggests that the repertoire of ncRNA may be relatively reduced in the microsporidian genomes and, taken altogether, that these ncRNAs may very well represent the minimal core set required by these parasites for their survival.2. Material and methods2.1. Detection and characterization of microsporidian ncRNAsConventional approaches used to annotate coding DNA sequences (CDS) consider the first AUG codon in an open reading frame as the transcriptional initiation site (TIS). However, this is often inaccurate and can cause the erroneous inclusion of intergenic regions and/or other small overlapping unpredicted genes in the 5' end of the CDS. To mitigate this and help identify ncRNA that could potentially be found in these overlapping segments, we first revisited the latest annotations from Encephalitozoon cuniculi (accession codes AL391737.2, AL590442.2-AL590451.2), Encephalitozoon intestinalis (accession codes CP001942.1-CP001952.1), Encephalitozoon hellem (accession codes CP002713.1-CP002724.1) and Encephalitozoon romaleae (accession codes CP003518.1-CP003530.1) genomes to better predict TIS and intergenic regions by taking advantage of transcriptional signals and the increased resolution in comparative analysis provided by the growing set of Encephalitozoon genomes.6,21,23 From these curated annotations we then used an “all-versus-all” BLASTN approach (word size: 7 nt, low-complexity filter disabled) to compare the intergenic regions of these four genomes and search for the presence of small but highly conserved stretches of DNA reflecting elevated levels of conservation—and potentially functional importance—in these genomes with the highest rates of sequence evolution in eukaryotes.18 BLASTN searches were also further performed in a directed fashion by specifically comparing intergenic regions from the same locus in the four species, which was made possible due to the extreme levels of synteny found across all Encephalitozoon genomes (1,824 colinear genes in 55 syntenic blocks).20 BLASTN results were manually explored and flanking regions analysed to identify putative transcriptional regulation signals. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with Clustal Omega24 to validate sequence conservation between the four Encephalitozoon genomes.The presence of ncRNAs in species from the genus Nosema was first investigated by screening the Nosema genomes (N. ceranae (accession codes JPQZ01000001-JPQZ01000536), N. apis (accession codes ANPH01000001-ANPH01001133) and N. bombycis (accession codes ACJZ01000001-ACJZ01003558)) for the Encephalitozoon ncRNA genes identified as described above using BLASTN searches (word size: 7 nts, Match/Mismatch Scores (1, -1), Gap Costs (Existence: 0 Extension: 2) and low-complexity filter disabled). Next, because accurate annotation and TIS prediction in Nosema genomes has been exclusively carried out for N. ceranae,25 only the intergenic regions from this species were extracted and used as queries against the N. apis and N. bombycis genomes for genus-specific BLASTN searches (same parameters), with putative hits investigated for the presence of transcriptional regulation signals as described above. Canonical secondary structures were predicted using locARNA26 and refined manually. In silico functional annotations of identified ncRNAs were conducted using the RFAM 12.0 database.27 ncRNAs lacking predicted functions after this step were annotated according to the expertize available in our group as follows. The C/D box snoRNA genes were annotated based on their conserved C (RUGAUGA) and D (CUGA) sequence motifs located at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, and based on a short terminal stem located 2 nt upstream and of the C and D boxes, respectively. Most of the C/D box candidate snoRNA genes also further contained another copy of the C and D motifs, albeit less conserved, located in the central region of the snoRNA sequence. H/ACA box snoRNA genes were annotated based on the presence of two hairpins and of the two H (ANANNA) and ACA (ACA) sequence motifs, located in the intergenic region between the two hairpins and at the 3' end immediately following the second hairpin, respectively. The U1 snRNA was annotated based on its well-conserved secondary structure and the presence of the 5' end highly conserved SS (ACUUAC) motif.To identify snoRNA targets in microsporidian rRNA, rRNA alignments between E. cuniculi, human and S. cerevisiae were performed to highlight homologous targets positions. In-house scripts were used to predict putative modified positions from both E. cuniculi snoRNA and rRNA sequences. rRNA alignments were built using multalin,28 (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr) for human, yeast and Encephalitozoon genomes. Positions modified in S. cerevisiae and human rRNA were obtained from the Human snoRNA29 and the S. cerevisiae snoRNA30 database, respectively. rRNA targets of Encephalitozoon box C/D and H/ACA snoRNA were then predicted by searching in rRNAs for putative base pairings to the expected regions in snoRNA (upstream the D or D’ box for C/D box snoRNA and in the pocket of the stem loop for H/ACA box snoRNA). E. cuniculi candidate targets were reported in the alignment. Positions labeled as modified in human and/or yeast and predicted as modified in E. cuniculi were kept as true positive modifications. SnoRNA actors of these modifications were assigned the same identifier than in human/yeast when possible. Identification of consensus sequences of A and B boxes from tRNA sequences have been performed with the MEME tool.312.2. Cell cultureHuman Foreskin Fibroblast (HFF) host cells (ATCC SCRC-1041) were infected by approximately 109 spores of E. cuniculi GB-M1 (kindly provided by Prof. Elisabeth U. Canning, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, UK) during 2 h in 75 cm2 flasks. Cultures were washed three times with PBS (1×) to remove spores that did not invade host cells and then incubated for two further days as described previously.32 Infected cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 20 µg/ml gentamicin.2.3. Total RNA isolation and polyuridylationTotal RNA from E. cuniculi-infected HFF cells were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA integrity and purity were verified on the 2200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Three micrograms of total RNAs were polyuridylated using a polyU polymerase in 25 µl reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in RNase-free water.2.4. 5'RACE-PCR experiments and 3' end amplification5' cDNA ends were characterized with the SMARTer RACE Amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction step was performed with 200 ng of E. cuniculi total polyuridylated RNAs using a universal poly(A)-stem-loop RT primer.33 This first strand reaction products were diluted with 50 µl of tricine-EDTA buffer and used both for 5' RACE-PCR (0.2 µM of each specific primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2 U of Taq polymerase) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and 3' end amplification using specific 3' primers and the universal reverse primer on an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient PCR machine with the following cycling parameters: 10 cycles of touch-down PCR (denaturation: 94 °C for 30s; annealing: 55–68 °C for 30 s; extension: 72 °C for 30 s), followed by 30 cycles of regular PCR with annealing at 52 °C. Specific 5' and 3' primers were defined using KASpOD software.342.5. PCR products sequencingAmplification products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Bands of the expected sizes were excised and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Purified PCR products were directly sequenced with the specific primers from the RACE amplifications. For weak band signal, PCR products were ligated into the pCR II TOPO vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit Dual Promoter, Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically competent XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells following the Inoue method.35 All sequences were determined using the Sanger dideoxynucleotides chemistry by MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) with the SP6 primers.3. Results3.1. Identification and validation of non-coding RNA genes in Encephalitozoon and Nosema sppUsing a synteny-driven “all-versus-all” BLASTN approach, a total of 10 new putative ncRNAs were predicted in the genomes of the four closely related Encephalitozoon species E. cuniculi, E. intestinalis, E. romaleae and E. hellem (Supplementary Table S1), raising the total to 18 with the eight ncRNAs (RNase P, MRP, SRP, U3 C/D snoRNA, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs) previously described in the RFAM 12.0 database27 for at least one of these genomes. Similarity and synteny-based ortholog searches in three AT-rich Nosema genomes (N. ceranae, N. apis and N. bombycis) retrieved only four out of the ten Encephalitozoon newly predicted ncRNAs, suggesting that the primary sequences of ncRNAs are overall poorly conserved throughout Microsporidia. However, using only intergenic regions of N. ceranae to screen N. apis and N. bombycis ones, we were able to identify seven additional ncRNAs. Thus, with the RNase P, U2, U3 and U6 ncRNA genes available in the RFAM 12.0 database, Nosema species would possess 15 ncRNA genes that are orthologous to Encephalitozoon ones (Supplementary Table S1).All 18 E. cuniculi ncRNAs were then validated by 5' and 3' RACE-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1) and Sanger sequencing of the full-length products. This approach allowed to precisely define their transcriptional initiation and termination sites (Fig. 1). The lengths of ncRNA primary sequences were found to be relatively well conserved between the four Encephalitozoon species and the three Nosema species (Supplementary Fig. S2) but otherwise to be generally shorter when compared with their respective yeast and human orthologs (Supplementary Table S1). For instance, the sequence of the SRP RNA is 60 nt shorter than its S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens homologs predicted in silico.36 However, U4 and U6 snRNAs are longer than their human and yeast orthologs and include unexpected additional stems located near their 3' end (Supplementary Fig. S3). Despite the overall size reduction and the lack of sequence similarity compared with the genus and other phyla, the Encephalitozoon ncRNAs were predicted to fold into canonical secondary structures, with the exception of an uncommon Alu domain in the Encephalitozoon SRP RNA (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2).Encephalitozoon cuniculi ncRNAs validated by 5' and 3' RACE-PCR and their potential regulation signals. Black boxes correspond to the potential TATA box signals for transcription initiation by RNA polymerases II or III. The potential transcriptional motifs (CCC/GGG-like signals) are boxed. For brevity, the ncRNA sequences were only represented by the transcription start site, the end of transcription and the corresponding gene name.Encephalitozoon cuniculi ncRNAs validated by 5' and 3' RACE-PCR and their potential regulation signals.

Specific domains of the molecule are given.Proposed secondary structure for the E. cuniculi SRP non-coding RNA. Specific domains of the molecule are given.Analyses of the upstream regions for all the 18 E. cuniculi ncRNAs revealed the presence of a conserved CCC or GGG motif located in close proximity of the transcriptional start site (TSS) (Fig. 1). Complementary analyses of upstream regions have also highlighted a TATA-like sequence for all the genes with the exception of the E. cuniculi and E. intestinalis U46 C/D snoRNA (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). For this last gene, in these two species, the TSS upstream region presents a higher cytosine and guanine percentage, such that we could locate only multiple CCC or GGG-like motifs. Searches for DNA signals implicated in 5' transcript processing for the other Encephalitozoon and Nosema species have shown the same signals for all the predicted ncRNA genes (Supplementary Table S2). In S. cerevisiae and more generally in eukaryotic cells, tRNA, U6 snRNA, RNase P RNA and SRP RNA genes are conventionally under the control of the RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III), specifically recruited by A or B box sequence motifs.37 While these cis-acting elements were unambiguously identified for all Encephalitozoon and Nosema tRNA genes, none could be found for the other three ncRNA families (Supplementary Table S2).3.2. Annotation of new ncRNAsAll ten newly predicted ncRNAs in the Encephalitozoon genus were assigned putative functions based on their predicted secondary structures (Supplementary Fig. S3). With the exception of the U1 spliceosomal snRNA, all newly identified ncRNAs fall within the C/D box or H/ACA snoRNA families. The U1 snRNA in Encephalitozoon species has retained the typical cloverleaf-like structure (Fig. 3a) with a four-way junction and a terminal stem-loop.38 However, the sequence of their SL1 and SL2 loops, which are key sites for snRNP specific proteins binding, differ significantly from their S. cerevisiae and human homologs and lack recognizable U1-70k (GAUCRYGARR) and U1A (YUGCAYUY) canonical protein binding sites.39 In agreement with motifs present at intron boundaries in Encephalitozoon, U1 snRNA displays a conserved human-like ACUUACC 5' splicing site (SS) motif. A binding site for the Sm proteins was identified at the expected position but differs from human and yeast Sm sites at positions 6, 8 and 9 (Fig. 3a and b). Using the above characteristics derived from the Encephalitozoon spp. U1 snRNAs, we were able to successfully confirm the presence of U1 orthologs in the three genomes from the Nosema genus (Fig. 3b). Remarkably, in microsporidia the length of the SL3 variable stem loop is shorter than in human and yeast. Interestingly, the SL2 stemloop sequence seems much more conserved between Encephalitozoon and Nosema species than SL1, whose sequence seems more genus specific.Proposed secondary structure for the E. cuniculi U1 snRNA (a) and multiple sequence alignment with U1 snRNA from other microsporidia, human and yeast (b).

The ncRNA located on E. cuniculi chromosome I (Supplementary Table S1) also displays C and D motifs characteristic of C/D box snoRNAs as well as an expected terminal stem (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, this ncRNA does not display any clear target in microsporidian rRNAs.Putative rRNA targets for the C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs encoded by E. cuniculi.

In all cases, putative 23S rRNA pseudouridylation pockets were found located 14 to 15 nt upstream from box H (ANANNA) and/or ACA terminal motifs (Fig. 4b), with hairpin secondary structures derived from multiple sequence alignment consensus compatible with those commonly found in snoRNAs H/ACA box. Based on their expected targets, we were able to assign human and S. cerevisiae orthologs to four (ACA10/snR37, U65/snR34, ACA27/snR42 and U19/snR191) of the five microsporidian H/ACA box snoRNAs. In human and S. cerevisiae, ACA10/snR37 targets two positions, respectively in 28S and 18S rRNA. Remarkably, in all available Encephalitozoon species—supposed more closely related to S. cerevisiae—ACA10/snR37 snoRNA contains only one pseudouridylation pocket which target the 23S rRNA at the expected conserved position. We were unable to propose rRNA or snRNA targets for the H/ACA snoRNA encoded by E. cuniculi chromosome II (Supplementary Table S1), which is conserved in Nosema genus but apparently not in S. cerevisiae and human. 4. DiscussionPredictive searches based on homology are inherently tied to the similarities that exist between targets and queries and, as sequences diverge, the signature elements that could help identify biologically-relevant relationships slowly fade away. Non-coding RNAs, in particular, are rather difficult to predict due to their general lack level of primary sequence homology and to the limited availability of software-based tools capable of investigating their secondary or tridimensional structures. In this study, we used the availability of multiple closely related Encephalitozoon and Nosema genomes as well as the presence of transcriptional signals to improve ncRNA gene prediction in Microsporidia from precisely delineated intergenic regions6,21 (here we note that intronic ncRNAs are highly unlikely in these species because few introns are present in Microsporidia and their introns are very short). Using our approach, we were able to identify ten new ncRNAs that are involved in pre-RNA processing and rRNA modification, thus in effect more than doubling the number of known ncRNAs encoded in these species.4.1. A complete RNA machinery of the major spliceosome?Despite their eukaryotic ancestry, microsporidia from the genus Encephalitozoon are intron poor, with less than 50 known spliceosomal introns per genome,6,40 and it is unclear if this scarcity is a consequence of or rather the cause behind the apparent reduced complexity of the spliceosome apparatus in these organisms. The spliceosome of E. cuniculi was predicted based on genome data to be much simpler than that of other eukaryotes and to be composed of only 37 proteins39,41,42 compared to its human (~200) and yeast (~100) counterparts, yet it clearly remains functional as indicated by splicing studies.44,45 However, up until now, many ncRNA components considered vital to the function of the eukaryotic spliceosome were missing from microsporidian annotations. In particular, although four U1-associated proteins were identified in the E. cuniculi genome, the U1 snRNA previously escaped bioinformatics detection despite large screenings39,41,43 that predicted the presence of U1 in only one microsporidia from the genus Antonospora. Our study represents the first evidence of the presence of U1 in Encephalitozoon and three Nosema species and confirms, as expected from splicing studies, that microsporidia possess a complete set of snRNA for the major spliceosome. With this small but whole set of snRNAs, its few splicing proteins and the scarce introns that are encoded in its genome, E. cuniculi can be now considered one of the simplest complete systems to investigate eukaryotic splicing mechanisms.4.2. Towards a minimal set of compact ncRNA genesMicrosporidia from the genus Encephalitozoon are models of extreme compaction with thoroughly streamlined genomes, a streamlining so pervasive that the functions left encoded within are likely essential to the survival of these parasites. As such, the subset of Encephalitozoon ncRNAs (15 out of 18) that is shared with Nosema species may very well represent the minimal set of ncRNA genes that is viable for any spliceosome-dependent eukaryote. The reductionist pressure exerted on the Encephalitozoon genomes resulted in a drastic genes loss during microsporidian evolution, in the shortening of the protein coding sequences and rRNA-coding regions but also in a general reduction in ncRNA size. A careful analysis of the secondary structure of each ncRNA revealed that their cores were reduced to the structural features that are preserved in all living cells, and that further reduction is unlikely without disrupting the underlying biological function(s). For example, the highly derived P3 helix and 3' domains of the RNase P and MRP RNAs, which are not critical for RNA processing,45 are highly reduced in Encephalitozoon spp. and compatible with the absence of the interacting protein Rpp20 from these organisms.46 Another example of high reduction is the SRP RNA, which lacks a canonical Alu domain in Encephalitozoon species. Encephalitozoon spp. lacks apparently the protein heterodimers that interact with this domain, i.e. SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72, and while these heterodimers could potentially be replaced by structurally related proteins, the reduced size of the microsporidian SRP RNA strongly argues against this.With a total number of snoRNAs that is but a fifth of that encountered in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae,47 the Encephalitozoon and Nosema genomes are pushing our understanding of how far ribosomes can devolve to yet remain functional. Here, all of the conserved microsporidian snoRNAs targeted modifications are realized in key regions of rRNAs, which argues in favor of an essential role for ribosome function.48,49 In the snoRNAs we identified here, even those with reduced structures have retained their characteristic target-binding pattern and sequence motifs, suggesting that very little is left to prune. Remarkably, we did not find any snoRNA involved in the modification of SSU rRNA or snRNA. The only H/ACA box snoRNA ortholog able to modify SSU rRNAs in human and S. cerevisiae lacks the necessary 3' pocket in Microsporidia, which begs the question: are SSU-modifying snoRNAs present at all in Microsporidia? We cannot exclude the possibility that highly divergent specimens are left to be discovered, but in light of the highly reduced microsporidian ribosomal rRNAs, they may be no longer necessary.4.3. A simplified RNA polymerase III recruitment?Non-coding RNAs in eukaryotes are transcribed by one of the three RNA polymerases known as RNA Pol I, II and III, with transcription initiation signals specific to each polymerase. Most genes transcribed by RNA Pol III fall into well-defined groups depending on the location or type of cis-acting elements, which constitute their promoters.10,50,51 In a significant subset of genes under control of the RNA Pol III, two regions known as A and B boxes are involved in the binding of the transcriptional factor TFIIIC.10 As expected, we identified these cis-acting A and B boxes—harboring the canonical consensuses TRGYNNANNNG and GWTCRANNC—for all tRNA genes in E. cuniculi and N. ceranae genomes (Supplementary Table S2). However, we could not locate these signals or any other putative Pol III-related signal in others microsporidian ncRNA genes known to be transcribed in eukaryotes by RNA Pol III (U6 snRNA, RNase P and MRP RNA). Because they play an important role in the formation of the L-shaped tertiary structure of the tRNA molecule, the A and B boxes could be subjected to more selection pressure when associated with tRNA genes, limiting consequently their variation.10Given these results, two major assumptions can be formulated. The first hypothesis is that although identifiable in tRNA genes, the A and B boxes used for the recruitment of the RNA Pol III in microsporidian ncRNAs are probably too degenerated to be detected by a homology-based method. This is consistent with the fact that these genomes display some of the highest rates of sequence evolution in eukaryotes.18 The high rate of sequence divergence could also explain why the 5S rRNA internal control region (ICR) C-box required for transcription and relatively well conserved between S. cerevisiae and Xenopus borealis rRNA 5S genes,52 could not be characterized in microsporidia despite their phylogenetic proximity with S. cerevisiae. The second hypothesis is based on an in vitro observation showing that in S. cerevisiae, TFIIIB can recruit RNA Pol III without the help of TFIIIC.53 Thus, a TATA box, without the need of any other transcriptional signal, could directly ensure TFIIIB and ultimately RNA Pol III recruitment for multiple rounds of accurately initiated transcription. In this scenario, the A and B boxes would not be required at all, and could be missing entirely from the Encephalitozoon ncRNAs.Interestingly, the systematic presence of a perfect CCC or GGG motif in 5' of all ncRNA and mRNA gene transcripts in E. cuniculi,6,23,42 regardless of the RNA polymerase involved (I, II or III), suggests that the RNA polymerase machinery in Encephalitozoon species could perhaps use common factors, in agreement with the apparent overall simplification of transcriptional processes in Microsporidia.In any case, novel experimental strategies will be required to understand more accurately the transcriptional regulation of coding and non-coding genes in Microsporidia. Notably, a better characterization of their general and specific transcription factors will further help identify which components of the transcriptional machinery are essential in these ultra-compact genome.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Conflict of interestNone declared.FundingThis work was supported in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under award number R15AI128627 to Jean-François Pombert.

IntroductionThe salivary microbiome is composed of ~700 species1 mostly belonging to the five phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria,2,3 similar to other oral microbiomes in the tongue, throat, and tonsil but relatively distinct from the plaque microbiome.4–6 The salivary microbiomes can be characterized by a significantly lower interindividual variability than microbial communities of other body sites such as the gut,7,8 but it is possible to differentiate individuals by phylogenic approaches.9 Though the salivary microbiome is associated with gut microbiome,10,11 the diversity in salivary microbiomes showed relatively low associations with several affecting factors including long-term diet,12 weight and gender,13 geographic location,14 and antibiotic treatment (high tolerance)15 compared with that of the gut microbiome. These apparent discrepancies between the salivary microbiome in the oral cavity and the gut microbiome in the intestine suggest the existence of different regulations and responses between them.On the other hand, several studies reported the association of the salivary microbiome with not only oral manifestations such as periodontitis and dental caries,16 Behcet’s syndrome and aphthous stomatitis,17 but also with several systemic diseases including pancreatic cancer,18 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),19 celiac disease,20 rheumatoid arthritis,21 and hepatic cirrhosis.22 These reports suggest that physiological changes at the distal lesion sites largely contribute to the alteration of salivary microbiome, and that the salivary microbiome appears to be more sensitive to host-related rather than environment-related factors in comparison with the gut microbiome.In this context, it is conceivable that the oral circadian rhythm as a host-related diurnal signal may affect the salivary microbiome in addition to salivary gland and epithelial homeostasis in the oral cavity.23 There have been several researches on the analysis of changes or stability in longitudinal salivary samples collected daily, monthly, or yearly.8,13,24,25 These studies showed the tendency of high stability of the human salivary microbiome over time with low intra-subject variations. Some of the papers also showed more shared species and lower taxonomic changes among the individual salivary than gut microbiomes.13,24 Unlike the gut microbiome, these observations further suggested that host-related internal signals had more impact on the salivary microbiome than external signals related to individual lifestyles. However, more recently, the individual salivary microbiomes collected with 4-h intervals in a day was reported to show little or no change in the microbial profiles.26In this study, we examined diurnal changes in salivary microbiomes longitudinally collected from six healthy subjects with 4-h intervals for 3 days by 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing of the salivary DNA. Our data revealed that the majority of salivary microbes exhibited the circadian rhythm profiles with ~24-h periodicity.2. Materials and methods2.1. Subjects and saliva sample collectionSix healthy volunteers were recruited. All subjects were informed of the purpose of this study. This study was approved by the ethical committees of the University of Tokyo and Azabu University, and written consent was obtained from all subjects. Fresh unstimulated saliva (~1 ml) were collected every 4 h at 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 in the first day, at 0:00, 4:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 in the second and third days, and at 0:00, 4:00, 8:00 in the fourth day, accounting for a total of 18 samples for each subject for 3 days (Supplementary Table S1). All subjects took a sleep from 0:00 to 8:00, and shortly awakened at 4:00 for sampling. The sampling of saliva was carried out at least 2 h after meal or toothbrushing. Collected saliva samples were kept at 4°C, frozen in liquid nitrogen within 24 h after sampling, and stored at -80°C until use for DNA preparation.2.2. DNA preparation and sequencingMicrobial DNA was prepared from saliva samples according to the method described previously.19 The 16S rRNA gene hypervariable V1–V2 regions were PCR-amplified using universal primers (a barcoded 27Fmod and 338R) and, multiplexed amplicon pyrosequencing was carried out using 454 GS FLX Titanium or 454 GS JUNIOR (Roche Applied Science).To obtain metagenomic sequences, we performed the whole-genome shotgun sequencing with the MiSeq (2 × 300 paired-end run) and IonProton (200-base reads with the Proton I chip) platforms according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Statistics of the sequencing was summarized in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively.2.3. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)The universal bacterial 16S rRNA primers, 27Fmod (5'-agrgtttgatymtggctcag-3') and 338R (5'-tgctgcctcccgtaggagt-3') were used to estimate the microbial cell number by real-time qPCR using Escherichiacoli 16S rRNA gene sequence as a standard.2.4. Data processing of 16S sequencesThe 16S V1–V2 sequences were assigned to samples on the basis of their barcode sequence. Reads with an average quality value (QV) < 25 and those lacking the primer sequences at both ends were filtered off. Possibly chimeric sequences that had alignment lengths of < 90% coverage with authentic reference 16S sequences in the database (described below) were also removed. Filter-passed reads obtained from these quality-check processes accounted for ~50% of the total reads. The majority of the removed reads represented those lacking PCR primer sequences. After trimming both primer sequences from the filter-passed reads, 3,000 reads per sample were randomly selected and used for further analyses.27 The high-quality reads were sorted according to the QV19 and then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a 96% pairwise-identity cutoff with the UCLUST program v.5.2.32 (http://drive5.com/usearch/manual/uclust_algo.html (31 January 2017, date last accessed)). The representative sequences of the generated OTUs were blasted to our own 16S database constructed in this study by GLSEARCH program to determine the closest taxa. The 16S database was constructed from three publically available databases: Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) v.10.31, CORE (http://microbiome.osu.edu/(31 January 2017, date last accessed)), and the reference genome sequence database obtained from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/ (December 2011, date last accessed)). For assignment of OTUs to the taxa at the phylum, genus and species level, sequence similarity thresholds of 70, 94, and 96% were applied. The results of the taxonomic assignment of the OTUs were summarized in Supplementary Table S3. UniFrac distance28,29 was calculated to assess the dissimilarity (distance) between each sample.2.5. Data processing of metagenomic sequencesIn Ion Proton reads, artificially duplicated sequences were removed using replicate filter if any sequences have a similarity of =95% identity to other sequences with identical starting position. Human-derived reads were removed by mapping them to the human genome (HG19) with Newbler. Finally, low-quality reads with average QV < 20 or < 75 bp were removed. For MiSeq reads, low quality bases (QV < 20) at the 5' end of reads were trimmed. Reads in which more than half of bases are QV < 20 and reads of which the length was < 50 bp were filtered out. These procedures were done using FASTX-Tool kit. The filter-passed reads were mapped to the human genome using bowtie2 and the mapped reads were also removed. Reads derived from phiX were also mapped to the phiX genome and the mapped reads were removed.The high-quality reads were then assembled into contigs by using the Newbler algorithm (v.1.1.03, provided with the GS FLX sequencer). Gene prediction was performed using MetaGeneAnnotator30 with the –m option for multiple species. The nucleotide sequences of predicted genes were clustered using cd-hit-est v.4.6 with a =95% sequence identity and =90% coverage. The clustered gene sequences were then translated to proteins using the NCBI translation table 11. Functional annotation of the predicted proteins was performed using BLASTP v.2.2.25 against KEGG database with an E-value 1e-5. We mapped 100 K high-quality reads onto the non-redundant gene set using bowtie2 to obtain the quantified functional composition in each sample. Also, we quantitatively evaluated the microbial composition by mapping 100 K high-quality reads onto the reference genomes under the conditions described previously.312.6. Periodicity discrimination method (PDM)In this study, we developed a PDM for evaluation of the periodicity of oscillation patterns of the relative abundance of given taxa and microbial categories.To figure out the periodicity of a given taxon X in a subject, the normalized abundance data of every 4 h for 3 days were prepared as a list and the average normalized abundance of each time zone was calculated as shown below.Then, the list was sorted with time zones (column vector in the shown table) by the average normalized abundance of each time zone. For example, when the average normalized abundance lined as follows; X2 > X4 > X5 > X3 > X1 > X6, the sorted list would be lined as shown below.This sorting operation is especially useful to reduce the calculation resources when the observed time points are further large, so that combination explosion can be avoided for selecting all possible combination of TimeZones.Then, sorted time zones in the sorted list are grouped as a combination of two separated ‘TimeZoneCombi’ which discern the deviation of the abundance between the two time zones. By using the following algorithm, the best P-value for a taxon and the TimeZoneCombi can be obtained.BestPvalue <U+2190> 1FOR each TimeZoneCombi BestPvalueOfTimeZone <U+2190> 1 FOR each Threshold = each data of taxa XPvalue <U+2190> CALL FisherExactTest WITH taxa X data in time zones of TimeZoneCombi, taxa X data of other time zones AND Threshold  IF Pvalue < BestPvalueOfTimeZone THEN   BestPvalueOfTimeZone <U+2190> Pvalue   BestThresholdOfTimeZone <U+2190> Threshold  END IF END FOR IF BestPvalueOfTimeZone < BestPvalue THEN  BestPvalue <U+2190> BestPvalueOfTimeZone  BestThreshold <U+2190> BestThresholdOfTimeZone  BestTimeZone <U+2190> TimeZoneCombi END IFEND FORIn the subprocedure ‘FisherExactTest’, the P value from the test is computed according to the 2 × 2 contingency table shown below.a: the number of time points of taxon X data in time zones of TimeZoneCombi which is equal or over the threshold.b: the number of time points of taxon X data in time zones of TimeZoneCombi which is under the threshold.c: the number of time points of taxon X data in other time zones which is equal or over the threshold.d: the number of time points of taxon X data in other time zones which is under the threshold.a: the number of time points of taxon X data in time zones of TimeZoneCombi which is equal or over the threshold.b: the number of time points of taxon X data in time zones of TimeZoneCombi which is under the threshold.c: the number of time points of taxon X data in other time zones which is equal or over the threshold.d: the number of time points of taxon X data in other time zones which is under the threshold.Thus, the less P value the taxon has, the stronger periodicity it is regarded to have.Furthermore, the time zones determined by TimeZoneCombi with the best P value are regarded as proliferating time zones for the taxon X.The whole procedures were depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1.3. Results3.1. Circadian rhythm in the salivary microbiomeWe longitudinally collected a total of 108 unstimulated salivary samples (18 samples per subject) every 4 h for 3 days from six healthy subjects (two females and four males). We enumerated sequences of the 16S rRNA gene V1–V2 region by pyrosequencing the salivary DNA with the Roche 454 platform (see Materials and methods). The 16S reads were clustered to obtain the OTUs for each subject, and the generated OTUs were assigned to taxa by blasting against the 16S databases (Supplementary Table S3). The phylum- and genus-level assignment apparently showed the diurnal change in the microbial abundance for all the subjects (Supplementary Fig. S2). We next performed the UniFrac distance analysis of the microbial communities, in which the distances between the samples at the same times (ST) and those at different times (DT) for 3 days were measured, respectively. The results revealed that the UniFrac distances between the ST samples were lower than those between the DT samples for all the subjects, of which the five subjects showed a statistical significance, indicating that the overall structure of the ST samples was more similar than that of the DT samples (Fig. 1a).Detection of diurnal oscillation in salivary microbiomes.

The vertical axis represents raw P values of the circadian periodicity of each genus calculated by the PDM. The horizontal axis represents the average relative abundance of each genus.We then performed the autocorrelation analysis for diurnal changes in the relative abundance of the two major phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in each subject between the 3 days. The analysis showed that the highest correlation coefficient was observed at ~24-h interval in all of the subjects (Fig. 1b). These data strongly suggested that the observed diurnal changes in the microbial abundance of the salivary microbiomes exhibited a circadian rhythm at the phylum level. Similar results were also obtained from the analysis using the microbial abundance data estimated from mapping of the metagenomic reads on the reference genomes (Supplementary Fig. S3).On the other hand, the hierarchical clustering of the samples based on the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient revealed that many of the ST samples but not all were clustered most closely within a subject, whereas all the samples were clearly aggregated by the individuals (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that the extent of circadian intra-subject variations was generally lower than that of the inter-subject variations.To detect the taxa with a statistically significant circadian periodicity, we developed the PDM that determines the P value for the circadian periodicity of each genus by using the Fisher’s exact test repeatedly for every possible threshold and time-zone combination (Supplementary Fig. S1). The PDM analysis followed by Bonferroni correction of 19 genera (18 known and one undefined) with = 0.1% relative abundance in all of the six subjects found that the genera accounting for 68.4–89.6% of the total abundance (~79.3% in average for the six subjects) exhibited a significant oscillation with the 24-h periodicity (P < 0.05), among which Prevotella, Gemella, Peptostreptococcus, Solobacterium, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus were statistically significant for all the subjects (Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore, we found a correlation between the relative abundance of the genera and the P value of the circadian periodicity in toto, which indicated that the higher abundant genera tended to have the stronger circadian periodicity, and vice versa (Fig. 1c). For the major four phyla, the PDM analysis also indicated the high circadian periodicity of them in most of the subjects as well as the autocorrelation analysis mentioned above (Supplementary Table S5). We also evaluated the circadian periodicity of the genera and phyla by JTK_CYCLE32 (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). In the genus level, JTK_CYCLE and PDM both showed the significant periodicity in Prevotella for the five subjects, Neisseria for the four subjects, Gemella and Streptococcus for the three subjects. In the phylum level, Bacteroidetes for the five subjects, Firmicutes for the four subjects, Proteobacteria for the three subjects, and Actinobacteria for the two subjects were significant in the circadian periodicity, respectively.In addition, we examined the diurnal change in the OTU number. We compared quantitative differences in all pairs of OTU numbers in the ST and those in the DT samples in each subject, but no significant difference was observed between them for all the subjects, suggesting that OTU number representing the species richness had no circadian oscillation (Supplementary Fig. S5).We further analysed changes in the microbial cell number by qPCR with universal 16S primers. The results observed statistically significant periodicity of microbial cell numbers in two of the six subjects, in which microbial cell number increased at 4:00 and 16:00 in the subject 3, and at 4:00 and 8:00 in the subject 4 (Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Fig. S6). These data suggested that microbial cell number also exhibited the circadian oscillation with individual differences.3.2. Characterization of circadian oscillation patternsWe characterized the oscillation pattern of salivary microbes at the phylum and genus level. We found that the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the evening, whilst that of Bacteroidetes was in the daytime in all the subjects, indicating that these two major phyla had an inverse relation in the circadian oscillation pattern (Fig. 2a). At the genus level, we showed proliferation time zones of the circadian oscillation of the 12 genera with = 1% relative abundance in all the subjects, respectively (Fig. 2b). Among the 12 genera, Prevotella, Gemella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus showed the significant circadian periodicity for all the subjects, but the other eight genera showed non-significant periodicity in a few subjects (Supplementary Table S4). The relative abundance of Prevotella was increased in the morning (from 4:00 to 12:00) in all the subjects, and those of Gemella and Streptococcus were increased in the evening (from 16:00 to 0:00) in all the subjects. The relative abundance of Haemophilus was proliferated in the morning (around 8:00) in all the subjects, but different proliferation time zones were also observed in three subjects. These genera are typical examples that had almost same circadian oscillation patterns shared among all the six subjects. The inverse oscillation pattern between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes described above could be largely due to the strong circadian periodicity of the top two pre-dominant Streptococcus and Prevotella genera belonging to these two phyla, respectively. Rothia had similar proliferation time zones in the relative abundance among four subjects but no significant circadian periodicity in two subjects. The other genera such as Granulicatella and Veillonella did not share similar proliferation time zones among the subjects with the significant circadian periodicity. These data revealed that a few but highly abundant genera had the strong circadian periodicity and similar circadian oscillation patterns shared with most of the subjects. Many of the genera had the significant circadian periodicity but their oscillation patterns were considerably varied among the subjects. Thus, these data suggested the high inter-subject variation in the circadian oscillation profile.Oscillation patterns of major taxa.

Bacterial phenotypes and oscillation patternsTo examine if the oscillation patterns of the salivary microbiome is determined by the bacterial phenotype, we compared the oscillation patterns between strict aerobes (AE), facultative anaerobes (FA), and strict anaerobes (AN). The PDM analysis revealed that the relative abundance of AE, FA, and AN had significant circadian oscillations in all the six subjects, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). We analysed changes in the average relative abundance of the three microbial categories through the three days (Fig. 3a). The results showed differences in the circadian oscillation patterns among the three categories, in which AN was proliferated in the morning between 4:00 and 12:00, and FA was in the evening between 16:00 and 4:00, indicating the circadian oscillation pattern of AN and FA had an inverse relation. On the other hand, the proliferation time zone of AE was the daytime between 8:00 and 20:00, which was intermediate between those of AN and FA. In the 19 genera with =0.1% relative abundance in all the subjects, Neisseria, Rothia, and Campylobacter were included in the typical AE pattern, Prevotella and Solobacterium were in the typical AN pattern, and Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Gemella were in the typical FA pattern, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7). These data revealed that the three categories defined by the bacterial aerobicity were sequentially proliferated in the relative abundance with some overlap among them in a day. The periodicity of the three microbial categories was also evaluated by JTK_CYCLE, showing similar results to those by the PDM (Supplementary Table S7).Circadian oscillation patterns of the bacterial phenotypes.

(b) Oscillation patterns of genera classified by the Gram stainability. The oscillation patterns of Gram-positive and -negative genera are shown.We also compared the oscillation pattern between Gram-positive and -negative species. The PDM and JTK_CYCLE analyses revealed that the relative abundance of Gram-positive and -negative genera had significant circadian oscillations in all the subjects, respectively (Supplementary Table S8). The analysis indicated that the Gram-positive species was proliferated in the evening between 16:00 and 4:00, whereas that of the Gram-negative species was in the day between 4:00 and 16:00, respectively (Fig. 3b). In the 19 genera with =0.1% relative abundance, oscillation patterns of several Gram-negative Prevotella and Haemophilus were similar to that of the all Gram-negative species, and those of several Gram-positive Streptococcus, Rothia, Actinomyces and Gemella were similar to that of the all Gram-positive species (Supplementary Fig. S8). Furthermore, the oscillation pattern of Gram-positive bacteria shown in Fig. 3b appeared to be overlapped with those of AE and FA shown in Fig. 3a, whereas that of Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be overlapped with those of AE and AN. The proportion of genera classified by the Gram stainability and aerobicity in samples of the subjects was shown in Supplementary Table S9.3.4. Disappearance of circadian rhythm in salivary microbiomes in vitroSalivary samples from two subjects (subjects 1 and 2) were incubated at 37°C in vitro under aerobic conditions, and changes in the microbial abundance in aliquot samples collected every 1 h for 7 h were monitored by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. These in vitro data were compared with those of salivary samples freshly collected with the ST intervals as those in vitro from the same two subjects (Supplementary Fig. S9). The results indicated that the in vitro samples had no longer change in the microbial composition with very low UniFrac distances between them, whilst freshly collected samples showed the circadian oscillation as expected.3.5. Functional analysis based on metagenomic dataFor addressing the biological periodicity, we performed the functional assignment of the annotated genes in the assembled metagenomic sequences, and found a total of 370 KEGG modules by using the KEGG database. We then quantified the 370 KEGG modules by mapping 100 K metagenomic reads per sample to them (see Materials and methods). The results detected 55 modules that significantly exhibited 24 h oscillation in more than five subjects (Fig. 4a). These mainly included the modules assigned to four functional categories, ‘Environmental information processing’, ‘Energy metabolism’, ‘Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism’, and ‘Nucleotide and amino acid metabolism’. Many of the modules assigned to ‘Environmental information processing’ were enriched in the evening (between 16:00 and 4:00), whereas those assigned to the other three functional categories were enriched in the morning (between 4:00 and 12:00), respectively, indicating the inverse relation between ‘Environmental information processing’ and the other three functional categories (Supplementary Fig. S10). The modules assigned to ‘Environmental information processing’ included the functions related to various transporters including those for metal ions and two-component regulatory systems. On the other hand, the modules assigned to ‘Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism’, ‘Energy metabolism’, and ‘Nucleotide and amino acid metabolism’ included the functions for the biosynthesis of vitamins and fatty acids, polysaccharides degradation, Hem biosynthesis from glutamate, the reductive citrate cycle, and electron transport.The KEGG modules having the circadian oscillation.

The analysis formed two distinct negatively correlated clusters, which were represented by positive correlations between Streptococcus and Gemella and many of the modules assigned to ‘Environmental information processing’, and those between Prevotella and Haemophilus and the modules assigned to ‘Energy metabolism’ (Fig. 4b). Granulicatella had no significant correlation with any of the module. These correlations were also related with the bacterial phenotypes, in which Streptococcus and Gemella were the Gram-positive, and Prevotella and Haemophilus were Gram-negative.4. DiscussionIn this study, we demonstrated that the majority of the salivary microbes exhibited the circadian oscillation with ~24-h in the relative abundance by the analysis using the 16S V1–V2 sequences obtained from the samples collected with 4-h intervals for three consecutive days from six healthy adults. We obtained the several pieces of evidence for the circadian oscillation from significant differences in the UniFrac distances between the samples collected at the same and DT in each subject, and apparent diurnal changes in the relative abundance of taxa at the phylum and genus level with the highest autocorrelation coefficient of ~24-h interval. Furthermore, the circadian periodicity of each taxon was also statistically evaluated by the PMD originally developed in this study. The basis of the PDM is to assess the reproducibility of proliferation time patterns of the relative abundance of each taxon by the Fisher exact test, so that the PDM is also applicable to the relatively minor taxa of which the 16S read number is zero in several samples. Therefore, the PDM generally enables us to detect more taxa with the periodic pattern than the JTK_CYCLE.32 The PDM analysis found that the major genera had the tendency of relatively high circadian periodicity compared with minor genera in the salivary microbiome, similar to the observation in the gut microbiome.33 However, on the contrary, the recent study reported almost no significant diurnal variation in the salivary microbiome by using the clustering analysis of two sample sets collected every 4 h in 24 h with a 1 week interval from five subjects.26 We similarly performed the hierarchical clustering of the same sample sets, but could not clearly show the closest relation between the samples collected at the ST by this clustering. Therefore, this inconsistency suggested that the hierarchical clustering was insufficient to differentiate subtle changes in variations within individuals.The circadian oscillation completely disappeared with very low UniFrac distances between the samples in the in vitro incubation experiments, suggesting that the circadian oscillation in the salivary microbiome is not an autonomous process, but a response linked to certain host’s signals and/or oral environmental changes associated with them. The salivary microbiome is thought to be formed by microbes adhered to various intraoral surfaces because the saliva is sterilely secreted from the salivary glands into the oral cavity.3 This implies that the microbes associated with intraoral surfaces may change their releasing level from the surfaces to the saliva and/or their growth rate in the saliva. The microbes in the throat, tonsil, and tongue may be the resources of the salivary microbiome because the salivary microbiome composition is similar to that of these microbiomes.4–6 In this context, the recent paper showed that the plaque microbiome exhibited little circadian oscillation,34 suggesting that the sensitivity to stimuli in the oral cavity differed between the plaque and salivary and possibly tongue and tonsil microbiomes.We observed differences in the circadian periodicities (P values estimated by the PDM) among various microbial categories by comparing the average P values of 28 microbial categories classified by the aerobicity, Gram stainability, and taxonomically (Supplementary Table S10). The data revealed that the first ten categories had much higher circadian periodicity than others, which included the three categories by the aerobicity, two by the Gram stainability, two phyla (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes), and three genera (Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Gemella). These oscillation patterns were clearer than those of the others. These data suggested large associations of these microbial categories to the circadian oscillation of the salivary microbiome. On the other hand, the other 18 genera exhibiting less periodicity than the 10 microbial categories had less similarity of the oscillation patterns among most of the subjects, suggesting the high inter-subject variation of these microbes in the circadian regulation of salivary microbiome.Regarding the bacterial phenotypes, our data suggested that the aerobicity in the oral cavity was also diurnally changed, and more aerobic around noon in a day according to the oscillation pattern of the three microbial categories classified by the aerobicity. In addition, the Gram stainability was also largely involved in the circadian oscillation in the salivary microbiome, in which Gram-positive and -negative species had the trade-off relation of circadian oscillation patterns. At present, we have no reasonable interpretation for the relationship between circadian oscillation and the Gram stainability.The circadian oscillation of gene functions was also evaluated by metagenomic data. In the daytime, the functions assigned to ‘Energy metabolism’ and ‘Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism’ mainly associated with Prevotella were enriched, and in the evening, those to ‘Environmental information processing’ mainly associated with Streptococcus were enriched, respectively. These findings suggest that functions of salivary microbes devote to environmental responses in the daytime, whereas those devote to metabolisms in the evening, and these functional oscillations may be related with maintenance of the oral homeostasis.Recently, it was reported that the gut microbiome exhibited the circadian oscillation in the microbial abundance in mice, and the circadian oscillation was abolished by disruption of a host circadian clock gene.33,35 From these observations, it can be suggested that the circadian oscillation of the salivary microbiome is regulated by host clock genes. Although ~15% of the salivary metabolites were reported to exhibit diurnal oscillation,36 the factors or signals affecting the circadian oscillation of the salivary microbiome are unknown at present and further investigation is needed to address them.The authors thank Dr Y.

IntroductionThe availability of large-scale gene expression data by microarray and RNASeq analyses provided the possibility of predicting transcriptional regulatory elements in promoters using these data. For such predictions, methods for extraction of consensus sequences from a set of promoter sequences have been used (e.g. Gibbs Sampler1 and MEME2). As the accuracy of these established methods is not sufficient for experimental validation, we have developed a novel, more accurate method based on a simple frequency comparison.3 The new method shows considerably higher accuracy and sensitivity than conventional methods, judged by re-prediction of experimentally identified regulatory elements.3 In addition, our recent studies demonstrated that it is also useful for predicting novel regulatory elements, and it has paved the way for prediction-oriented promoter analysis.4–6Our prediction method compares the frequency of every octamer between focused and global promoter sets. This octamer-based methodology has worked well for recognition sites of many types of transcription factors including bZIP, AP2/DREB, zinc finger, CAMTA, and also PCF families. However, it is theoretically not good for the detection of spacer-containing bipartite motifs that are recognized by protein complexes including dimers. As a consequence, these promoter elements are considered a blind spot of our octamer-based prediction method.There are several databases for detection of transcription factor-binding sites in the promoter region. Among them, JASPAR7 is the most popular public database that covers higher plants. Detection of promoter elements is based on DNA motifs for each transcription factor proteins, and in the case of Arabidopsis which is the most intensely collected for data in higher plants, motifs for 48 factors are available out of ~1,900 transcription factors in the genome.8 The 48 factors include bipartite motifs for several MADS family proteins and an AP2 family protein, ANT. Obviously, the coverage is low for continuous and also bipartite motifs.In this report, we have developed a supplemental method for promoter prediction that compensates for this blind spot by incorporating bipartite octamers (4 + 4 bases) to predictions that contain a spacer sequence in the middle. Our results using the pre-selected bipartite octamers showed improved prediction of the ER-stress responsive element (ERSE) as an element for tunicamycin-activated ER stress, and of ANAC017 target sites in promoters of the down-stream genes of ANAC017.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bioinformatics analysis24,956 Arabidopsis promoter sequences of 1 kb long, starting from the most major transcription start site (TSS), were prepared previously.9 Counting of each bipartite octamer, statistical analyses, and LDSS (local distribution of short sequences) analysis10 were achieved with home-made Perl and C+ programs, and Excel (Microsoft Japan, Tokyo). Distribution profiles of bipartite octamers were subjected to smoothing with a 21 bin, which is a good width for regulatory sequences (REG),10 clustered with Cluster11 by the hierarchical method with correlation measurement, and visualized with TreeView11 as described previously.10 Prediction of transcriptional regulatory elements based on microarray data with the aid of a list of bipartite octamers was achieved essentially according to our previous report3 using modified software. Motifs of clustered sequences were expressed using WebLogo.12 For prediction of ERSEs, 162 genes with a fold-change of over 2.5 were selected from up-regulated genes (E-MEXP-3186 from ArrayExpress, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ (11 January 2017, date last accessed)).13 as a positive promoter group. Microarray data of ANAC017 mutants were also retrieved from ArrayExpress (E-GEOD-41136).142.2. DNA–protein binding analysisComplementary DNA for ANAC017 was prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from total RNA of Arabidopsis seedlings using a conventional method as described elsewhere.15 The coding sequence of the Flag tag and a T7 promoter were added to the ANAC017 CDS excluding the transmembrane domain (1–523 aa14) by PCR. The prepared PCR product was subjected to in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase and subsequent in vitro translation by a wheat germ system as described previously.6 Binding assays of the Flag-tagged ANAC017 protein and biotinylated oligo-DNA probes were achieved using AlphaScreen (Perkin Elmer Japan, Tokyo) as described.6 Sequences of a biotinylated DNA probe and non-biotinylated competitors are shown in Fig. 6.3. Results and discussion3.1. Pre-selection of potential regulatory sequencesIn our previous study, promoter prediction using microarray data based on enumerative octamer analysis was developed.3 The degree of overrepresentation for each octamer among a set of promoter sequences showing some transcriptional response over total promoters in a genome is calculated as the ‘Relative Appearance Ratio (RAR)’ . When predicting a specific promoter, an octamer is taken from the 5' end of the promoter, the corresponding RAR value for the octamer is put back to the corresponding promoter position. Repeating these steps sliding 1 bp each time towards the 3' direction provides a promoter scan with the RAR.3–6 Peak positions in the scanned results are predicted regulatory sites. We extended this procedure using a new type of bipartite octamers composed of ‘4 bases + a spacer + 4 bases’. In this article, we will refer to these octamers as ‘bipartite octamers (4 + 4)’.As a pilot analysis, we surveyed 12 lengths of the spacer from 1 to 12 bases long. Analysis of all the possible bipartite octamers with a 12-spacer length gives 12 RAR values for each promoter point. While trials of this prediction method for cold- and high light-stress responsive elements detected novel promoter sequences that could not be detected by the previous octamer analysis without spacers, they also gave us highly complex results making their analysis difficult (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to pre-select potential regulatory sequences before carrying out frequency analysis. For this purpose, we set the priorities to high coverage over accuracy in the sequence selection, because an accurate, and thus small, selection at this point results in low sensitivity of prediction. Accuracy can be increased at the subsequent prediction steps.During the analysis mentioned above, we noticed an overrepresentation of a specific spacer length over the others when the octamer (4 + 4) sequence is fixed. Fig. 1 shows examples of the relationship between the spacer length and the counts in the total 24,956 promoters of the Arabidopsis genome. In the case of AACGnTCGT (n = 0–12), a spacer of three appears ~4 times more frequently than the other spacer lengths. The probability of this count profile, represented by the peak and total counts, under the assumption of random occurrence is very low (P = 2.2E-195), suggesting a strong selection pressure towards this biased profile. Interestingly, a count profile of its complementary sequence (ACGAnCGTT) also shows the same characteristics where a spacer of three gives a single high peak.Overrepresentation of a specific length of spacer in promoter sequences. Counts of a bipartite-type octamer with a spacer in all the promoters of the Arabidopsis genome are shown. The horizontal axis indicates the number of ‘n’s, i.e. the length of the spacer between the two tetramers. The two octamers shown (AACGnTCGT and ACGAnCGTT) are mutually complementary.Overrepresentation of a specific length of spacer in promoter sequences. Counts of a bipartite-type octamer with a spacer in all the promoters of the Arabidopsis genome are shown. The horizontal axis indicates the number of ‘n’s, i.e. the length of the spacer between the two tetramers. The two octamers shown (AACGnTCGT and ACGAnCGTT) are mutually complementary.Preferential appearance in the promoter sequence and conservation of characteristics between forward and reverse sequences may suggest that they are transcriptional regulatory sequences. Therefore, we decided to select bipartite octamers that have a preference for the spacer length among the promoter sequences.With spacer lengths from 0 to 12, the number of possible bipartite octamers (4 + 4) is 48 × 13 = 65,536 × 13 (Table 1). First, one spacer length from 0 to 12 bp for each octamer with the highest count among the promoter sequences was selected, extracting 65,536 sequences from 65,536 × 13. Second, sequences with spacers of 0 and 1 were removed from 65,536 sequences because they were thought to be detected by established analysis using octamers without a spacer. Then, the P value of the count profile with 12 spacer lengths for each bipartite octamer, as shown in Fig. 1, was considered, focusing on a peak height and the total count for 13 spacers, and 9,022 octamers with P < 1E-5 were selected. Selection of bipartite octamersOf the 13 spacing lengths, one with the highest appearance in the promoters was selected (Peak space), and octamers with spacing lengths of 0 or 1, and octamers with the two spacings of highest appearance (twin peaks) were removed. Distribution profiles were subjected to statistical analysis and octamers with a profile of P < E-5, as determined by the Chi-square test, were further selected. Selected octamers were subjected to LDSS analysis and TATA-, Core-, and Solid-type octamers were removed, providing a final 8,044 bipartite octamers.Selection of bipartite octamersOf the 13 spacing lengths, one with the highest appearance in the promoters was selected (Peak space), and octamers with spacing lengths of 0 or 1, and octamers with the two spacings of highest appearance (twin peaks) were removed.

These results demonstrate their distribution profile is direction-insensitive, and this feature is the same as the REG type of continuous octamers.10 Considering the distribution profiles, sequences in clusters 1 and 2 of Fig. 2C are classified as the REG type.Sequence lists of the removed core and solid groups, and also the 8,044 selected sequences containing REG and non-REG types can be found in Supplementary Tables S1–S3, respectively.In order to pick up sequence groups from the extracted sequences, 1,053 selected REG-type sequences which are predicted to be regulatory sequences10 were mapped to 24,714 Arabidopsis promoter sequences with 1 kb length, and a matrix of presence/absence (1,053 × 24,714) was subjected to 2D clustering analysis (Fig. 4). This analysis provided us the clearest classification of cis elements.10 As shown in Panel A, several clusters have been identified each of which shares bipartite octamers and promoters.Several groups in the REG-type bipartite octamers. 1,053 bipartite octamers with distribution profiles of the REG type (Fig. 2C) were mapped to 24,714 Arabidopsis promoters, and a resultant presence/absence matrix (1,053 × 24,714) was subjected to 2D clustering analysis (A).

Octamers of 20 largest clusters were subjected to WebLogo (B). Some pairs of cluster (1–9, 2–15, 3–4, 5–7, 10–17, 12–13) are complementary, respectively. Clusters 5 and 7 are ERSE (CCAAT-N9-CCACG).Several groups in the REG-type bipartite octamers. 1,053 bipartite octamers with distribution profiles of the REG type (Fig. 2C) were mapped to 24,714 Arabidopsis promoters, and a resultant presence/absence matrix (1,053 × 24,714) was subjected to 2D clustering analysis (A).

Clusters 5 and 7 are ERSE (CCAAT-N9-CCACG).We subsequently selected 20 largest clusters for summarization of the bipartite octamers for each cluster as sequence motifs. The motifs prepared with WebLogo12 are shown in Panel B. Several tandem repeats (clusters 1, 6, 9, 12, and 13) and also palindromic sequence (clusters 8 and 11) are included. We suggest that they are recognized by a dimer or a trimer of the same protein family.3.2. Inclusion of known transcriptional regulatory elements in selected bipartite octamersThe 8,044 selected sequences include REG-type groups. According to their LDSS profiles, they are strongly suggested to be transcriptional regulatory sequences.10 Their inclusion in the selected sequences is an indication of the ability of the procedure utilized to identify potential regulatory sequences.In order to find other features that may be regulatory elements in the sequences selected, we surveyed known transcriptional regulatory elements within the sequences. One of the reported bipartite regulatory motifs is the endoplasmic reticulum stress-responsive element (ERSE, consensus sequence CCAAT-N9-CCACG) that is conserved between mammals and higher plants.16 The ERSE in mammals is known to be recognized by a general transcription factor NF-Y for CCAAT and the stress responsive transcription factor ATF6 for CCACG, and spacing between the two elements is fixed to nine nucleotides.17 An ERSE is also found in Arabidopsis promoters and is known to have a conserved function.18When we searched the selected sequences for ERSEs, 28 related sequences were found (Table 2), indicating the inclusion of these elements in the extracted sequences. Then, microarray data of the transcriptional response to ER stress activated by tunicamycin treatment19 were used to calculate the RAR values of the selected sequences. Typically, RAR values of over 3.0 are considered ‘positive’ as transcriptional regulatory sequences.3 As shown in Table 2, the RAR values of most of the ERSE-related sequences are much >3.0 (shown in bold in the table). These results mean that the bipartite ERSEs can be detected as ER stress (tunicamycin treatment)-responsive elements in our promoter prediction using the selected bipartite octamers (4 + 4). The application of such promoter prediction will be demonstrated later in this article.

Sequence matching with ERSE is indicated with underlining. A dot in a sequence means any nucleotide. The RAR values of each octamer for tunicamycin up-regulation are also shown. RAR values >3.0 are shown in bold.Another reported bipartite motif of higher plants is the NAC-binding motif (CTTG-N5-CAAG) that is recognized by Arabidopsis ANAC013.20 This is also called the mitochondrial dysfunction motif (MDM) which includes the NAC-binding site and has several sequence variations.20 Our extracted bipartite sequences included 13 sequences related to the NAC-binding motif (Table 3). The presence of these sequences in the extracted sequences also supports the idea that our method does extract bipartite transcriptional regulatory sequences. One feature of this group is non-REG-type distribution (Table 3). NAC target sequences in the selected bipartite octamersLDSS cluster indicates the group number of LDSS clustering shown in Fig. 2C. Sequence matching with the NAC target motif is underlined. A dot in a sequence means any nucleotide.NAC target sequences in the selected bipartite octamersLDSS cluster indicates the group number of LDSS clustering shown in Fig. 2C. Sequence matching with the NAC target motif is underlined. A dot in a sequence means any nucleotide.As the NAC gene family is composed of 94–106 genes in Arabidopsis,8 variations in the target sequence among this family and differentiation of their function could be present. Therefore, the sequences in Table 3 may be recognized by different NAC proteins.3.3. Applications of bipartite octamer analysis to promoter predictionThe selected 8,044 bipartite octamers were utilized for promoter prediction. An ER stress-responsive BiP3 promoter was selected for the prediction of tunicamycin-responsive elements. The results of this prediction were compared with those obtained using the established method using octamers without any spacers.Figure 5A shows the results of promoter scans of BiP3 for tunicamycin-responsive elements. The vertical axis shows the RAR, and typically peaks >3.0 are selected as prediction sites. As shown, several peaks are >3.0, and two of them match experimentally identified ERSEs, ERSE-A, and ERSE-B.21 The RAR values of bipartite octamers are indicated with red X marks, and they show much higher RAR values than the continuous octamers at the positions of ERSEs, demonstrating the superiority of the bipartite octamers in detection of the ERSE.Promoter prediction of BiP3/BiP-L for tunicamycin response.

(A) Results of promoter scans using octamers (green line graph) and bipartite octamers (red X mark) are shown.

In both cases, the CCACG site of the ERSE, which is the recognition site (CGTGT, the underlining shows the match with the ERSE) of the ATF6 homolog of Arabidopsis, bZIP28,18 was detected by continuous octamer analysis, but the NF-Y binding site (ATTGG, the underlining shows the match with ERSE)18 was not. These results indicate that the bZIP binding site of the ERSE has some specificity in ER-stress responsive promoters, but the NF-Y site does not have any specificity in the same promoters, resulting in the failure to detect the NF-Y site as an ERSE.For comparison, the same gene list from the microarray data of tunicamycin response has been applied to Gibbs Sampler, MEME, CONSENSUS and MD Scan provided by Melina II.22 These four methods could not detect either ERSE-A or ERSE-B (data not shown).Predictions using our bipartite octamers are shown in red letters in Fig. 5B and C. Both the bZIP and NF-Y binding sites were detected as putative ERSEs, indicating the advantage of using the bipartite octamer analysis to predict the bipartite ERSE. Comparison of the RAR signals between the two methods reveals that signals of the bipartite octamer analysis are much higher than those of the continuous octamer analysis (Panel A). This indicates higher sequence specificity of the detected ERSE sequences in the bipartite octamer method than in the continuous method.These results, shown in Fig. 5, demonstrate that detection of ERSEs among tunicamycin-stimulated ER-stress responsive promoters has been considerably improved by introducing the bipartite octamer analysis.The second application of our new method is the prediction of ANAC017 target sites using microarray data of Arabidopsis ANAC017 mutants.14 As ANAC017 is a mediator of H2O2 signaling, the effect of a mutation was compared with wild type after H2O2 treatments. As shown in Fig. 6A, a promoter region of ATERF71 was predicted as a target site of ANAC017 (underlined) according to the following results: the expression level of ATERF71 was reduced in the ANAC017 mutants, and a target site of ANAC017 predicted by bipartite octamer analysis was mapped to the promoter region of ATERF71.Direct binding of ANAC017 to a bipartite octamer predicted for H2O2 response.

The average and standard error of four assays are shown.In order to confirm the predicted target site of ANAC017, direct binding of ANAC017 protein to the DNA sequence was examined in vitro by the AlphaScreen method. A FLAG-tagged ANAC017 protein was prepared in vitro using wheat germ and subjected to binding assays with a biotinylated oligo DNA probe. As shown in Fig. 6, binding assays of the ANAC017 protein to the probe containing the predicted target site gave positive signals, indicating direct binding (no competitor, Panel B). Addition of a non-biotinylated competitor reduced the signal (competitor M0), but addition of mutated competitors of M1, M2, M3, and M6 failed to reduce the binding signals. The target sequence, revealed by these assays, that is necessary for the binding is shown with asterisks in Panel A. These results demonstrate that the bipartite octamer analysis developed here has predicted the exact target sequence of the ANAC017 protein based on microarray data of ANAC017 mutants.3.4. Possibility of further extensionWe have tried several patterns other than [4 + 4], but could not obtain good improvements so far. In an example, a zinc finger protein, STOP1, recognizes [3 + 3 + 2] in a target promoter,5 but prediction of the target site using its knockout data was better with [8] than with [3 + 3 + 2] for some unknown reason. Currently, only results of [4 + 4] are worth reporting. We have given up to increase division patterns. We now think that extension of octamer analysis is enough with addition of [4 + 4].In summary, we have successfully developed a supplementary method for promoter prediction for spacer-containing transcriptional regulatory elements in Arabidopsis. This method should be used alongside the octamer analysis that was established year ago3 and is applicable to any other genomes that are thought to contain bipartite transcriptional regulatory elements.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary Tables S1–S3 are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work is supported in part by JST ALCA (to Y.Y.Y.) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas ‘Plant Perception’ (No. 23120511) (to Y.Y.Y.).Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe emergence of second-generation sequencing technologies has led to an accumulation of genome sequence data providing broad access to reference genomes and thus, depicting important resources for addressing evolutionary questions. However, the quality of reference genome assemblies often suffers from short-sequencing reads and even sophisticated assembly algorithms can struggle with repetitive and duplicated regions, either not detecting specific stretches or artificially duplicating polymorphic regions.1–3In the western honeybee Apis mellifera, the major royal jelly protein (mrjp) gene cluster provides an excellent system to test for assembly problems in regions comprising multi-copy genes. The gene cluster is located on chromosome 11 between two yellow genes (y-e3 and y-h)4,5 consisting of nine protein coding genes mrjp1 to 9 and one pseudogene – mrjp-<U+03A8>, recently renamed into mrjp2-like.4–7 All major royal jelly proteins (MRJP) show a remarkable pairwise identity ranging from 47% to 74%8 and have mostly been identified in royal jelly (RJ),9,10 a hypopharyngeal gland secretion produced by nurse bees feeding the brood.11 In A. mellifera, the RJ-feeding regime determines the prospective caste (queen or worker) of developing female larvae and although it has been under discussion that a specific MRJP in RJ might interfere with queen determination there is according to newer investigations no indication that MRJPs transcend the long proposed nutritional value in RJ.6,12Whereas the nine mrjps found in the genome have been confirmed on mRNA and protein level in A. mellifera,10,13 similar information about the mrjps in other honeybee species is missing and only available for some mrjp homologues.14–17 Based on draft genome sequences, first insights in the gene cluster organization of the most basal species A. florea suggested a highly conserved gene order except for the position of the pseudogene (mrjp-<U+03A8>/2-like).8 However, because mrjps have all evolved from the same yellow gene, they share high-sequence similarity and structural resemblance4: a challenge for an accurate assembly of this complex region based on short sequence reads. And indeed, in A. mellifera certain indications for local mis-assemblies are given: nearly identical sequence stretches of two adjacently located genes, the pseudogene mrjp2-like (GB55211) and mrjp2 (GB55212), provide evidence for artificially duplicated regions present in the current gene cluster assembly (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, Sanger sequencing of mrjp2 revealed the absence of a duplicated 430 bp region (GenBank: KX951418; Supplementary Fig. S2). These hints indicate that the currently available mrjp cluster sequence might have suffered from short-sequencing read assembly mistakes due to repetitive and duplicated regions.Sequencing technologies that allow for extensive read lengths, as e.g. PacBio® or Illumina® TruSeq Synthetic Long-Read, provide unprecedented power to improve genome assemblies18,19 and to solve assembly problems even in highly repetitive and/or duplicated regions. An alternative to these established long-read sequencing technologies is the MinIONTM sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd), which uses a very different sequencing strategy. This technique facilitates sequencing through pore-forming proteins (so-called nanopores) that naturally act as ion or small molecule channels, embedded in a polymer membrane. Upon applying voltage across the membrane, the nanopore is passed by ionic current which is in turn subject to characteristic interruptions dependent on the DNA base crossing the pore. In contrast to next-generation sequencing usually based on DNA fragments of 200–400 consecutive bases which are later on assembled, nanopores allow for sequencing of long DNA strands in one piece currently limited to a length of approximately 200,000 bases.20 Thus, assembly caused problems do not even occur in the first place and if amplicon sequencing is performed read lengths are rather limited by PCR restrictions than by the sequencing itself. We here validate and reconstruct the genomic organization of the mrjp region by combining long-range PCR and long-read nanopore sequencing to investigate synteny of mrjp genes between the three honeybee species, Apis mellifera, Apis florea and Apis dorsata.2. Material and methods2.1. Samples and DNA extractionGene order conservation of the mrjp gene cluster was analyzed in three species of the genus Apis: A. mellifera carnica (Halle/Saale, Germany, 2014), A. dorsata (Manaol, Phillipines, 2013) and A. florea (Dien Bien, Vietnam, 2013), each represented by a single worker. Genomic DNA was extracted from thoraces using phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA purity was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany).2.2. PCR/purificationDNA primers (Metabion, Planegg, Germany) were designed using Primer321 spanning at least two neighbouring genes. Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s; 66 °C for 15 s; 68 °C for 1 min/kb; with a final elongation at 68 °C for 16 min. Each 10 µl reaction contained 8.0 mM dNTPs, 0.3 µM of each gene-specific forward and reverse primer, 0.25 U of PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Europe/S.A.S., Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) and 1 µL DNA. Fragment sizes were inspected on a 0.7% TAE agarose gel. PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany). Quantity of purified amplicons was determined using ND-1000 (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). For some primer combinations, PCR amplification yielded an additional 2.5 – 3.0 kb PCR product (see Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, we set a minimum read length of 6.5 kb to exclude reads possibly produced from these additional PCR products (see below). Primers used for PCR and summary of MinIONTM read countFor the location of the respective amplicons within the cluster see Fig. 3. Expected sizes were calculated based on the reference genomic sequences. The last column refers to the number of reads that mapped using the selection criteria given in the previous column. Due to assembly errors or sequencing gaps in reference sequences, selection criteria for adAmp3, adAmp6 and adAmp7 were less stringent compared to the other amplicons. Consensus calling was adjusted to the minimum number of reads (amAmp6: 16 reads).aAmplification yielded an additional smaller PCR product (Supplementary Fig. S3).Primers used for PCR and summary of MinIONTM read countFor the location of the respective amplicons within the cluster see Fig. 3.

SequencingLong-amplicon sequencing was performed with MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd)—a nanopore-based sequencing technology capable of producing read length s of up to 200 kb20,22,23 facilitating continuous sequencing across the entire mrjp cluster region.Prior to MinION library preparation, amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts. The amplicon pool was end-repaired using the NEBNext End Repair Module (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA), followed by Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany) purification and dA-tailing for 10 min at 37 °C using NEBNextdA-Tailing Module. dA-tailed DNA was purified as described above. The dA-tailed DNA was further processed using the SQK-MAP006 sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore) following manufacturer’s instructions. Finally 150–195 ng of the pre-sequencing mix were loaded into the flow cells (N = 2). The 48 h sequencing protocol was chosen. The sequencing protocol was run for 2 h (MinKNOWTM software 0.50.2). Base calling was performed using the MetrichorTM Agent (Oxford Nanopore). Metrichor produces the fast5 file format containing fastq files, which were extracted using poRe.24 Oxford Nanopore raw reads have been uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive (Accession number: SRR4426288). Only 2D reads (comprising information from both DNA strands) with a minimum read length of 6.5 kb (see above) were included in subsequent analyses (Supplementary Fig. S4). Reads were first mapped against the three reference genomes (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA_000469605.1_Apis_dorsata_1.3; ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA_000184785.1_Aflo_1.0 (11 January 2017, date last accessed); Amel4.5) in order to assign reads to the corresponding amplicon (by species and genomic target). Read mapping was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). With regard to the high error rate less stringent mapping parameter settings were used: mismatch cost of 2; insertion/deletion costs of 2 and 1, respectively; insertion/deletion open and extend cost of 6 and 1, respectively; length fraction of 0.7/0.5; a similarity fraction of 0.6/0.5 (see below).2.4. Data analysesA graphical presentation of the data analysis pipeline is provided in Fig. 1. Sequencing yielded 8468 2D reads, with a median length of 2814 bp (range: 165–15,889 bp) and a mean sequence quality of 10 (Phred score) (Supplementary Fig. S4). For subsequent analyses, only reads = 6.5 kbp were included resulting in 2261 reads that matched these size requirements.Graphical presentation of the data analysis pipeline. 2D raw reads (1) were size-selected (minimum read length of 6.5 kb) (2) and mapped against the three reference genomes, in order to assign the reads by species and genomic target (3). Only those reads that matched our quality filters (similarity fraction: 0.6 [0.5 for adAmp3, 6 and 7], length fraction: 0.7 [0.5 for adAmp3, 6 and 7]) were included in further analyses (4). Per amplicon sixteen reads (minimum number of reads that mapped to an amplicon—amAmp6) were selected and aligned to each other independent of a reference sequence to build the nanopore-derived consensus sequence (5). Finally, the consensus sequence and the reference sequence were aligned (6). In order to correct the genomic reference sequences of the mrjp gene cluster of A. mellifera, A. florea and A. dorsata, assembly gaps (N) and local mis-assemblies were identified based on this consensus/reference sequence alignment. Assembly gaps (N) in the reference sequence were replaced with the consensus sequence and mis-assemblies were either discarded (when only present in the reference but not in the consensus sequence) or included (when only present in the consensus but not in the reference sequence).Graphical presentation of the data analysis pipeline. 2D raw reads (1) were size-selected (minimum read length of 6.5 kb) (2) and mapped against the three reference genomes, in order to assign the reads by species and genomic target (3).

In order to correct the genomic reference sequences of the mrjp gene cluster of A. mellifera, A. florea and A. dorsata, assembly gaps (N) and local mis-assemblies were identified based on this consensus/reference sequence alignment. Assembly gaps (N) in the reference sequence were replaced with the consensus sequence and mis-assemblies were either discarded (when only present in the reference but not in the consensus sequence) or included (when only present in the consensus but not in the reference sequence).Only reads where at least 70% of the alignment matched the reference sequence and displayed at least 60% identity were included in the analyses. These selection criteria were chosen as others reported on MinION error rates between 30% and 40%.22,23 Applying the stringent quality filters (similarity fraction: 0.6; length fraction: 0.7), only 46% of the 2261 reads mapped to the reference sequences (A. mellifera 356, A. florea 498, A. dorsata 185; Table 1). These selection criteria did only result in 21 reads mapping to the amplicons adAmp3, adAmp6 and adAmp7 as assembly errors or sequencing gaps in the reference sequences caused reduced mappability. Therefore, read selection criteria for these amplicons were reduced (similarity fraction: 0.5; length fraction: 0.5) leading to 98 additional reads mapping to adAmp3, adAmp6 and adAmp7. As 16 reads was the minimum number of reads that mapped to an amplicon (amAmp6; Table 1), for each amplicon, a subset of 16 random reads were selected, aligned to each other (gap open and extend cost 5.0 and 1.0, respectively) and a Nanopore-derived consensus sequence was built. We used for each amplicon the same number of reads in order to account for amplicon coverage-bias. However, the accuracy of an inferred consensus sequence is always dependent on various parameters such as the alignment program, their parameters, thresholds and the depth of the aligned reads and thus using different analysis programs might lead to slightly different consensus sequences.The nanopore-derived consensus and the corresponding genomic reference sequences were aligned (MAFFT Version 7) in order to close assembly gaps and identify misassembled regions in the reference sequences (Fig. 1). Assembly gaps are stretches of undefined nucleotides (N) of a predicted size in reference sequences. In regions comprising assembly gaps, the alignments of the gap-spanning nanopore consensus sequence to gap-flanking regions were used to infer the actual gap size and nucleotide sequence. To identify and correct misassembled regions alignment discrepancies encompassing >250 bp were considered as indication for a local misassembly. Stretches of unaligned bases in the reference genome without counterpart in the consensus sequence were considered as ‘foreign’, whereas unaligned bases present in the consensus sequence but absent from the reference were scored as ‘missing’. The genomic reference sequences were accordingly corrected (gap closure; elimination of foreign sequence stretches) and are available as Supplementary Fig. S7- S9.The MRJP amino acid sequences were derived from the corrected genome sequences and used for a subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Amino acid sequences of Bombus terrestris yellow e-3 (GenBank accession: ADW82101.1) and Bombus impatiens yellow-like (GenBank accession: XP_003493839.1) were used as an outgroup. We constructed a maximum-likelihood tree based on multiple sequence alignment using MEGA version 5,25 to infer the evolutionary relationships among Apis MRJP proteins (model: Jones-Taylor-Thornton + Gamma distribution; bootstrap analysis: 500 replications).2.5. Sanger sequencingIn order to validate the presence of mrjp10 in A. dorsata and A. florea and for the purpose of re-sequencing mrjp2 in A. mellifera, these genes were sequenced using traditional Sanger sequencing. Therefore, amplification was performed in a thermocycler, with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s; 60 °C for 15 s; 68 °C for 6 min and a final elongation step for 10 min at 68 °C. The PCR reaction setup was as described above. Sequencing of afmrjp10 and admrjp10 has been performed by LGC genomics (Berlin, Germany). The initial sequencing step has been performed using the amplification primer. In order to cover the full-length sequence, nested (internal) sequencing primers were used. Amplification- and sequencing-primers are given in Supplementary Table S1. Sanger sequences are deposited on GenBank (GenBank accession numbers: KX925848 (A. dorsata mrjp10), KX925849 (A. florea mrjp10) and KX951418 (A. mellifera mrjp2).3. Results and discussion3.1. Error rates of MinIONTM sequencingTo analyze error patterns of the MinION sequencing, one gene, admrjp10, independently sequenced using Sanger sequencing (GenBank accession number: KX925848) was used to exemplarily infer the error rate and patterns of individual sequencing reads for the aligned region (˜ 3200 bp) using NGS-eval.26 In total, 21 individual sequencing reads were used to exemplarily infer the error patterns. For an individual read, the most prominent error type is substitution (average substitution per aligned base: 0.098). Average insertions and deletions per aligned base are 0.053 and 0.066, respectively (Fig. 2A). The highest substitution rates were observed for adenine (A) and the lowest substitution rates for cytosine (C) (Fig. 2B). Adenine and thymine got frequently substituted by guanine and cytosine. This pattern most likely reflects the base composition of the target sequence, which is A/T rich. In order to describe the relationship between error rates and sequencing depth, several consensus sequences were built averaging sequence information from multiple reads. For this purpose, consensus sequences (2–4 replications each) were generated using 3, 5, 7, 11 or 21 reads. Here, substitutions, ambiguous nucleotides and insertions per aligned base decreased with increasing sequencing depth, while deletions were almost unaffected by sequence coverage (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the occurrence of deletions is rather a systemic error. Indeed, deletions primarily occur in regions comprising homopolymer stretches (85.7%), while the remaining deletions occurred in other repetitive regions like dinucleotide motifs (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the number of deleted bases is directly related to the length of a homopolymer stretch (Fig. 2D).Error patterns of sequencing reads.

Apis melliferaFor A. mellifera, six overlapping PCR products were sequenced spanning the entire mrjp gene cluster comprising ˜ 57 kb (Fig. 3; GenBank accession: KY087961) broadly confirming the original structure of the cluster4,5 with mrjp3, 1, 4, 6 and 5 located at the 5' end of the cluster. In the reference genome, mrjp5 is than followed by a partial mrjp-like sequence (LOC102654393), the pseudogene mrjp2-like and mrjp2 (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, we observed an 8 kb-fragment size variation in the region spanning mrjp5 to 2 (amAmp4) (expected: ˜ 22 kb; observed: ˜ 14 kb). In contrast to the reference genome, the sequence of amplicon amAmp4 did neither include the pseudogene mrjp2-like nor its flanking region (Supplementary Fig. S5). The high-sequence identity between mrjp2-like (GB55211) and mrjp2 (GB55212) suggests that this sequence stretch is a segmental duplication resulting from a short read sequencing assembly error (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus mrjp2-like (GB55211) is actually an assembly artefact and not a pseudogene within the cluster. In order to confirm our findings, we amplified the region spanning mrjp5–mrjp7 using two different primer combinations. For both primer pairs observed and expected amplicon size differed by ˜ 8 kb (I. primer: expected: ˜27.5 kb; observed ˜19.5 kb; II. primer pair: expected: ˜25.0 kb; observed ˜17.0 kb) (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, the amAmp4 consensus sequence is not in line with the current mrjp2 (GB55212) annotation (Supplementary Fig. S5). The original 430 bp duplication in GB55212 (comprising the first two introns, as well as exon2, OGSv3.2) was absent in our amAmp4 sequence, probably also representing an assembly artefact in Amel_4.5. Sanger sequencing of ammrjp2 confirmed the absence of this sequence stretch (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, our sequence of mrjp2 matched the NCBI mRNA prediction (NM_001011580.1). A partial mrjp-like sequence (LOC102654393), symbolized by the black destructed arrow in Fig. 3, located between mrjp5 and 2 (Amel_4.5)27 could be verified (Supplementary Fig. S5).Schematic organization of the major royal jelly protein gene cluster across three species of the genus Apis.

Gene names are the corrected ones after the phylogenetic analysis.To independently validate our findings, we used A. m. carnica short sequencing data28 to analyze coverage variation between the original mrjp gene cluster (GC) and our long-read guided assembly (lacking segmental duplications). Whereas sequence coverage for an unchanged control region (mrjp1) is similar (72×) for both gene cluster assemblies, coverage of mrjp2 considerably increased when mapped against our long-read guided assembly (original GC: 16×; new GC: 64×).The genomic organization of the genes mrjp7, mrjp8 and mrjp9 located downstream of mrjp2 could be verified (Fig. 3).3.3. Apis floreaFirst insights in the gene cluster of A. florea suggested a similar gene order to A. mellifera (mrjp3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 2, <U+03A8>, 7, 8 and 9), with a switch in position of the so far predicted pseudogene (mrjp-<U+03A8>/2-like) and mrjp2 (for more information see Fig. 2 in Buttstedt et al.8). The amplicon sizes for A. florea were in the expected range, except for afAmp6 (expected: ˜ 10.8 kb; observed: ˜ 7.8 kb; see below). Sequencing four overlapping PCR products at the 5'prime end of the gene cluster (Fig. 3), confirmed the proposed gene order8 for five mrjps (afmrjp3–5). We were not able to amplify the region between mrjp5 and 7 which was supposed to harbour afmrjp2 and afmrjp-<U+03A8>8. However, analyzing the reference genomic sequence revealed indeed two full-length genes to be located between mrjp5 and mrjp7 (Fig. 3). This is in contrast to A. mellifera, where mrjp5 is followed by one partial mrjp-like sequence and a full-length mrjp (mrjp2). Amplicons afAmp5 and 6 confirmed the presence of mrjp7 and 8 but not mrjp9. Instead we identified an additional afAmp6-R primer-binding site on an unplaced genomic scaffold04303 (1909 bp). This scaffold showed a ˜550bp sequence overlap with the 3'prime end of afAmp6, whereas a part (the last 60 bp) of the remaining sequence is highly identical to the 5'prime region of mrjp9. Thus, scaffold04303 should be replaced between mrjp8 and mrjp9, to close the gap in the current assembly. Assemblies based on MinIONTM consensus sequences have been deposited on Genbank (Accession nos. KY087959 and KY087960).3.4. Apis dorsataFor A. dorsata, up to now no mrjp gene order has been proposed. Here, seven overlapping PCR products were sequenced spanning two contiguous parts of the mrjp gene cluster (Fig. 3; GenBank accession nos. KY087957 and KY087958). The observed amplicon sizes were in the expected range, except for adAmp6 (expected: ˜ 14.9 kb; observed: ˜ 12.5 kb). The majority of the reads mapped to the unplaced genomic scaffold_260 (KI273360.1) comprising admrjp3–8, whereas a minor proportion mapped to the unplaced genomic scaffold_444 (KI273484.1) containing admrjp9. The mrjp region contained several gaps within the partial reference sequences, which could be resolved based on the nanopore-derived consensus sequence. Our sequence analysis confirmed the general arrangement of mrjp3–5. One full-length mrjp-like gene, located downstream of admrjp5 (amplicon adAmp5) (Fig. 3), could not unambiguously assigned to an A.mellifera homologue. Furthermore a ˜ 1.4 kb sequence stretch, present in the partial genome sequence between admrjp2 and admrjp8, was absent in our adAmp6 sequence, probably representing an assembly artefact. Whereas amplicon adAmp6 confirmed the presence of admrjp2, we only found a truncated A. dorsata homologue of mrjp7 at the supposed position in A. mellifera and A. florea. The location of mrjp8 and 9 at the 3' end of the cluster was verified by amplicon adAmp7.3.5. A new member of the mrjp family—mrjp10In all three Apis species, mrjp3, 1, 4, 6 and 5 showed an identical location at the 5' end of the cluster and mrjp8 and 9 were always found at the 3' end (Fig. 3). Between mrjp5 and 8, the gene order seems to be less clear: In A. mellifera, a partial mrjp-like sequence is followed by ammrjp2 and 7; in A florea, two full-length afmrjps (which have previously been described as afmrjp2 and afmrjp-<U+03A8>8) are followed by afmrjp7 and in A. dorsata an unknown full-length admrjp is followed by admrjp2 and a partial admrjp (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic reconstruction based on MRJP amino acid sequences suggest that A. dorsata and A. florea seem to encode a previously uncharacterized member of the gene cluster, located directly downstream of mrjp5, which we propose to be called mrjp10 (Fig. 4). Thus, the full-length mrjp of A. florea found downstream of afmrjp5 is not as formerly predicted afmrjp28 but indeed afmrjp10. In our analyses, afMRJP10 clustered together with adMRJP10, missing a homologous protein in A. mellifera where multiple sequence alignment suggests a truncated ammrjp-like gene (corresponding to LOC102654393) located between ammrjp5and ammrjp2. Evidence for a full-length mrjp10 homologue in A. mellifera is missing due to the absence of the first three exons. The occurrence of mrjp10 in A. florea and A. dorsata has in addition been validated by Sanger sequencing (GenBank: KX925848 and KX925849).Phylogeny of Apis major royal jelly proteins (MRJP). The maximum-likelihood tree was reconstructed from aligned amino acid sequences using Jones–Taylor–Thornton, including bootstrapping (500 replications). A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (five categories, G parameter = 2.1115). All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 365 positions in the final dataset. Model selection was performed using MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al.25). Sequences for afMRJP10 (old = afMRJP2), afMRJP2 (old = afMRJP<U+03C8>) and afMRJP9 were derived from the draft genome (scaffold 1824).

Thus, all three Apis species possess a full-length mrjp2. In contrast, amMRJP7 clustered together with afMRJP7 but a full length homologue in A. dorsata was missing (Fig. 4).4. ConclusionsIn the era of sociogenomics, comparative analyses are key to understand features linked to advanced social organization (e.g.29,30)—presuming high-quality (draft) genomes and reliable gene predictions. However, even well-studied genomes are not error-free2,3 and this might affect downstream dependencies. Technical innovations including improved sequencing strategies, assembly algorithms and gene prediction methods, have been shown to substantially enhance the initial A. mellifera reference genome.27 However, our results provide evidence that even additional incorporation of alternative sequencing strategies (ABI SOLiD and Roche 454 paired-end sequencing) was insufficient to fully resolve a complex region.In A. mellifera, gene order within a multi-copy gene cluster has been previously determined by Drapeau et al. as y-e3, ammrjp3, ammrjp1, ammrjp4, ammrjp6, ammrjp5, a truncated RJ gene ammrjp-<U+03A8>, ammrjp2, ammrjp7, ammrjp8, ammrjp9 and y-h.4,5 In the current NCBI annotation, ammrjp5 is followed by a truncated mrjp (probably mrjp-<U+03A8> in the publication by Drapeau et al.4) and a full-length mrjp named ammrjp2-like (in recent publications referred to as pseudogene). The proposed ammrjp2-like gene (pseudo; GB55211) located between ammrjp5 and ammrjp2 appears to be an assembly artefact arising from short read sequencing as we show here by long-amplicon sequencing. The truncated variant already described by Drapeau et al.4 as pseudogene was also found in our study. The honeybee genome sequence has repeatedly been used as a framework studying key mechanisms of eusociality. However, sequence assembly errors will affect reference genome-guided analyses: e.g. variant calling (polymorphisms) or skew large-scale gene expression analyses. For example Mao et al.31 and Vojvodic et al.32 reported on the expression of mrjp2-like (pseudo; GB55211) in A. mellifera. However, these reads most likely belonged to ammrjp2, thus biasing the gene expression estimates of ammrjp2. Evolutionary rate estimates33,34 might be biased as well. Moreover, long-amplicon reads are also suitable to solve inter-scaffold gaps as shown for A. florea. For example scaffold04303 between mrjp8 and mrjp9, replaced the gap in the current assembly. Thus, even in spite of ~10% nucleotide-sequencing errors, MinION reads were most suitable to reconstruct the organization of extensive gene clusters. The combination of long-range PCR with third-generation sequencing overcame the intrinsic problems of short-sequencing reads assemblies.Our results suggest a similar gene cluster organization among the three Apis species. However, the number of full-length homologues is different. Whereas the A. florea genome possesses 10 full-length mrjp genes, A. dorsata and A. mellifera comprise only nine. In that regard, our results indicate lineage-specific evolutionary fates of mrjp duplicates located between mrjp5 and 8. In A. florea, the region between mrjp5 and 8 encodes three full-length mrjps: afmrjp10—a previously uncharacterized member of the mrjp/yellow family, afmrjp2 and afmrjp7. A full-length copy of mrjp10 is also existing in A. dorsata but only partially present in A. mellifera (LOC102654393). In contrast, mrjp7 is present in A. mellifera and A. florea, but a full-length homolog in A. dorsata is missing.A phylogenetic reconstruction based on the MRJP amino acid sequences revealed 10 terminal MRJP clades (Fig. 4). However, the various orthologous mrjp genes are more similar among species than the within-species paralog genes, suggesting a common ancestral gene cluster structure for all studied species. Taking into account recent phylogenetic findings, indicating that A. florea is basal to the cavity nesting and giant honeybees,35 we conclude that the common ancestor likely encoded 10 mrjps. This is further supported by the presence of incomplete gene copies in the more derived species, A. mellifera (mrjp10) and A. dorsata (mrjp7). The region from mrjp5–8 thus might have experienced a period of reduced selective constraint accompanied with accumulation of non-synonymous deleterious mutations, facilitating independent gene loss in A. mellifera and A. dorsata after their divergence.Temporal functional redundancy following gene duplication is assumed to reduce selective constraint on one copy und thus provides a prerequisite for pseudogenization, neo- and/or sub-functionalization,36–38 ultimately determining the evolutionary fate of gene copies (preservation or loss). In case of the Apis mrjp genes, neo- and subfunctionalization might synergistically contribute to their accumulation and preservation. Expression patterns for the ancestral mrjp8 and 9 differ remarkably from the remaining mrjps. Almost ubiquitous transcript abundances of mrjp8 and 9 across various body sections and independent of caste suggest a more general physiological than a nutritive function for both gene products.4,13 Hence, subfunctionalization might explain preservation of this ancestral gene pair mrjp8 and 9. In contrast, worker- and tissue-biased expression of mrjp1–7 indicates spatial and functional separation from mrjp8 and 9, suggesting neofunctionalization of an ancestral duplicate. All worker-mrjps are predominantly expressed in heads, although their spatial expression patterns indicate further differentiation–with preferential expression in hypopharyngeal glands (for those genes encoding proteins with nutritional value) and/or the brain.39 Moreover, elevated transcript abundances of some mrjps in brood-raising nurse bees compared with foragers (and vice versa) indicate more specialized functions related to division of labor.13,32 Phylogenetic trajectories revealed different complements of worker-mrjp genes within Apis and in this regard, each species might express a slightly different set of mrjps, whose conditional expression is assumed to impact their evolution. Genes almost exclusively expressed in sterile workers (in A. mellifera: mrjp1–7) but with a phenotypic effect in another individual, are considered as indirect effect genes and are thus expected to evolve under relaxed purifying selection.40 In contrast, mrjp8 and 9 are both evenly expressed across all body sections and irrespective of social state,13 thus exert a direct effect in the individual itself. Therefore, different evolutionary modes of mrjps might be a consequence of species-specific conditional expression of worker-mrjps. However, currently we lack information concerning timing and tissue specificity of expression even for the shared set of worker-mrjps for A. florea and A. dorsata. Nevertheless, at least we can draw on expression data for A.florea.41 Using the TSA BLAST database from NCBI, we were able to identify transcripts supporting the expression of the afmrjps including transcripts matching afmrjp2 and afmrjp10 (Supplementary Table S2). However, using the A. florea antennal transcriptome (Bioproject PRJNA325192), we identified reads supporting the expression of all mrjps except mrjp10.Also the cause of pseudogenization/loss of mrjp7 in A. dorsata and mrjp10 in A. mellifera, while preservation in the respectively other species and conservation of both duplicates in A. florea, remains obscure. Whereas increased transcript abundance of mrjp7 in the mushroom bodies of A. mellifera are indicative for a function in the honeybee brain,13,39 absolutely nothing is known about the expression/function of mrjp10 in A. dorsata or A. florea. Maybe both gene products exhibit at least partial functional redundancy and reciprocal gene loss is a consequence of dosage-sensitivity in the respective lineages. However, different patterns of mrjp-like gene loss and retention are common in Hymenoptera8 and may be a consequence of lineage specific adaptation.Characterization and comparative analysis of mrjp expression pattern in A. florea and A. dorsata would help to infer the extent of gene expression diversity or might indicate functional redundancy between lost/retained genes. In addition, comparative analyses of the mrjp gene cluster organization in other honeybee species belonging to the three subgenera (Micrapis, Megapis and Apis) might also help to unravel the evolutionary history of this multi-gene family.We thank Alexis Beaurepaire for travelling around the world collecting bees and Eduard Schwarz for sequencing mrjp2 in A. mellifera.

IntroductionPear (Pyrus spp.) is an important and popular rosaceous fruit crop cultivated in temperate regions for its economic and nutritional value. In 2014, the world production of pear was 25.8 million tonnes, from a harvest area of 1.6 million ha (http://faostat3.fao.org, 31 December 2016, date last accessed), making it the second most important fruit crop in the Maloideae, after apple. Improving pear germplasm is necessary for fruit breeders to meet consumer preferences and adapt to variable cultivation conditions. Increasingly, traditional breeding approaches are complemented by molecular breeding to take advantage of its efficiency in seedling selection and breeding for complex traits1 using genomic selection. Essential molecular breeding tools include molecular markers, genetic maps, and whole genome sequences. These tools have many applications in pear, including genetic diversity analyses2–4 and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for production traits and fruit quality.5–12Prototypes of pear genetic maps used marker techniques, such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD),13 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR).14–17 Among different types of markers, SSR markers have been widely used in constructing pear genetic maps because of their co-dominant and transferable nature,18 thus can be used as common markers to compare and construct consensus maps. From 2007, various pear genetic maps were constructed based on SSR markers.16,17,19–21 However, the map with the highest density19 consisted of only 734 markers and covered 1,661.4 cM, which makes it difficult to facilitate map-based gene cloning. The construction of these maps were limited to the available molecular markers, either developed from pear expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or transferred from related species, both of which are labour- and time-consuming.When the cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) decreased, pear whole genome sequences were released,22 and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were applied rapidly for genetic map construction.10,20,23,24 The first SNP-based pear genetic map had 857 markers,23 but subsequently a ‘Bayuehong (BYH)’ × ‘Dangshansuli’ map with 3,143 SNP markers was developed with the restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) technology and 98 SSR markers.10 A ‘Hosui’ (Pyruspyrifolia) map of 609 SNP markers and 252 SSR markers was developed from transcriptome data.24 Compared with previous genetic maps of pear, SNP-based maps significantly increased the number of genetic markers covering the whole genome.High-quality genetic maps are not only valuable tools for QTL mapping, but can also serve to anchor genome assembly scaffolds into pseudo-chromosomes.25 The draft genome of ‘Dangshansuli’ (Pyrusbretschneideri Rehd.)22 was reported as highly heterozygous, and assembled with a ×194 coverage of BAC-by-BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) and NGS. The assembly consisted of 512.0 Mb sequences and 2,103 scaffolds, corresponding to 97.1% of the estimated genome size. From the assembly, 386.7 Mb (or 75.5%), was anchored into 17 pseudo-chromosomes corresponding to the basic chromosome number of pear (x = 17), using a genetic map of 2,005 SNP markers. Concurrently, the draft genome of the European pear ‘Bartlett’ (Pyruscommunis L.) was assembled with ×11.4 coverage NGS data and consisted of 142,089 scaffolds covering 577.3 Mb in the assembled genome,26 accounting for most of the expected 600 Mb genome size. However, using 2,279 genetically mapped loci (1,391 apple and 888 pear SNPs), only 171.4 Mb (29.7%) of these scaffolds were anchored to linkage groups (LGs), due to the relatively fragmented scaffold sequences and an insufficient genetic map used to anchor the scaffolds. Therefore, it is important and necessary to develop higher quality genetic maps to help improve the scaffolds anchoring ratio of the ‘Bartlett’ v1.0 genome assembly.For this study, we collected nine published pear genetic maps to build an integrated SSR and SNP-based pear consensus genetic map, which was used for map comparisons. Additionally, a set of three high-quality SNP-based pear genetic maps with European pear genetic backgrounds was used for anchoring the ‘Bartlett’ v1.0 genome scaffolds. The new ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 genome assembly was further used for synteny analyses.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of a new genetic map for ‘Old Home (OH)’ × ‘Louise Bon Jersey (LBJ)’A new OHxLBJ genetic map was constructed using SNPs derived from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS).27 The two European pear cultivars ‘OH’ and ‘LBJ’ were used to create a segregation population of 297 progenies at The New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research (PFR).5,23 Total DNA was extracted from young leaves of sixty F1 trees in their third year of growth after grafting using the CTAB method.28 The GBS libraries were prepared using restriction enzyme BamHI following a modified version of the protocol developed by Elshire et al.27 with the following modifications: one microgram of DNA was used for the restriction digestion; adapter annealing was done following the protocol of Ko et al.29; the adapter ligation step was performed following digestion without drying out the DNA/adaptor mixture; high fidelity enzyme (AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity, Life Technologies) was used for amplification; the libraries were amplified and cleaned up prior to pooling. The pooled GBS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform in parallel in two lanes in single-end mode with reads length of 101 bases. The average read count per library was 1.85 million and 1.86 million for the two lanes. The reads were trimmed from 3' and 64 bases long fragments were kept after de-multiplexing. The Phred score for bases in the trimmed reads were higher than 20, so no read was discarded after trimming. The sequencing quality was checked with FastQC version 0.11.2.30 Genotyping was carried out using TASSEL/GBS v5 pipeline,31 using the ‘Bartlett’ v1.0 genome assembly as a reference genome. For SNP discovery, we requested at least eight supporting reads per site. Mapping of tags (64-base long unique genomics sequences) to the reference genome was performed using Bowtie2 v2.2.532 in—end-to-end and—very-sensitive modes. To get the flanking sequences, 250 nucleotides at either side of an SNP site were extracted from the reference genome. Additionally, SNP markers were considered of good quality when they segregated in a Mendelian manner: ABxAA (1:1 ratio), ABxAB (1:2:1 ratio) and AAxAB (1:1 ratio).33 All SNPs with missing data for >10 individuals were removed from the analysis. A merged genetic map for both parents was constructed using the package Onemap34 version 2.0-4 in R-studio (R Core Team, 2016). A LOD (logarithm of odds) score of five or higher was used for grouping and the genetic maps were calculated using the Kosambi function. LG numbers were assigned by comparing markers in the new OHxLBJ with the SNP array-based OHxLBJ map published by Montanari et al.232.2. Collection of pear genetic maps and genome resourcesNine previously published genetic maps were selected to construct an integrated pear consensus genetic (I-PCG) map using common SSR markers among maps as shown in Fig. 1A.10,16,17,19–21,23,24 These maps were generated from four pear populations, including ‘BYH’ × ‘Dangshansuli’ (two maps), ‘Bartlett’ × ‘Hosui’ (four maps), ‘Shinsei’ × 282-12 (‘Hosui’ × ‘La France’) (one map), and ‘Akiakari’ × ‘Taihaku’ (two maps). ‘BYH’ is a descendant of European pear ‘Clapp’s Favorite’ and Chinese pear ‘Zaosuli’. ‘Dangshansuli’ is a native Chinese pear cultivar. The convention of SSR marker names was not exactly the same, especially for those SSRs indicating multiple loci. For instance, TsuGNH235-1 and TsuGNH235_m1 should be the same marker. Thus, we scanned all SSR marker names and renamed them if necessary. The map IDs were named based on their cultivar abbreviations and publication abbreviations (detail information is listed in Table 1).

These three maps included the newly created genetic map OHxLBJ, a ‘BYH’ map extracted from the ‘BYH’ × ‘Dangshansuli’ consensus map (named BYHxDS-JXB),10 and a European pear and interspecific Asian pear hybrid consensus genetic (PH-CG) map attained from the 10 genetic maps published by Montanari et al.23 derived from five populations, including OHxLBJ, PremP003 × ‘Moonglow’ (T003xM), PEAR1 × PEAR2 (T042xT081),9 POP369 (T052xT003), and POP356 (T052xT064).8 The BYH map was a subset of BYHxDS-JXB10 with marker names start with Pyb and Pybd, representing SNPs derived from ‘BYH’ and both parents, respectively.The I-PCG map was not used for anchoring the ‘Bartlett’ v1.0 genome scaffolds (Fig. 1) because the consensus genetic map had a mixed genetic background of P. bretschneideri, P. pyrifolia and P. communis, which could cause more unpredictable conflicts owing to genome variation. The OHxLBJ and PH-CG maps were not merged into the I-PCG map (Fig. 1) because they were SNP-based maps, and markers in these maps were all unique and had no common markers with the I-PCG map for anchoring the corresponding LGs.Pseudo-chromosome sequences of ‘Dangshansuli’ genome v1.0 were retrieved from the Pear Genome Project website (http://peargenome.njau.edu.cn/default.asp?d=4&m=2, 31 December 2016, date last accessed); scaffold sequences of the ‘Bartlett’ v1.0 genome (https://www.rosaceae.org/species/pyrus/pyrus_communis/genome_v1.0, 31 December 2016, date last accessed); and pseudo-chromosome sequences of the ‘Golden Delicious’ genome version 1.0 primary (https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0p, 31 December 2016, date last accessed) were retrieved from the Genome Database of Rosaceae (https://www.rosaceae.org/).2.3. Construction and comparison of pear consensus genetic mapsMergeMap,35 a software that uses common markers from different maps as bridging markers to merge maps, was used to create the I-PCG map from nine published maps (Fig. 1A) and the PH-CG map (Fig. 1B). To prepare input data for Mergemap, we firstly removed conflict markers that presented in inconsistent LGs. Secondly, each individual LG in the input genetic maps for MergeMap was filtered using three criteria: number of markers in a LG not <3, LG length not <5 cM, and maximum common markers of a LG with other maps not <3. Thirdly, for the I-PCG map, each individual map was set as equal weights in the map merging process, while for the PH-CG map, individual maps were set based on the genetic background of European pear, weight = 4 if an individual map was P. communis, weight = 2 if one of its parents was P. communis, and weight = 1 if one of its grandparents was P. communis. Lastly, Mergemap tried to resolve conflicts in map positions among the individual maps by deleting a minimum set of marker occurrences.35 Genetic map comparison between the I-PCG and individual maps were visualized by the Strudel36 software.Most maps for constructing the I-PCG map consisted of 17 LGs, which was the same as the basic chromosome number of pear (x = 17), except for two maps (HS-TGG and AK-BS) (Table 1). To confirm whether these maps were appropriate for merging into one consensus map, we firstly calculated the number of common SSR markers between these maps (Table 2). Each map was found to have at least 26 SSR markers in common with any other map. For instance, the number of common SSR markers for AK-BS vs. TH-BS, AK-BS vs. BL-AH and TH-BS vs. BL-AH was 115, 105 and 139, respectively.

Anchoring ‘Bartlett’ scaffolds and synteny analyses of intra- or inter-genomesSSR primer sequences and SNP flanking sequences were mapped onto ‘Bartlett’ scaffolds using isPcr and blat programs, respectively.37 In either condition, only the best match of each marker was kept, and markers were removed if there were two equally good best matches. The ALLMAPS software, with the strength of computing a scaffold ordering that maximizes collinearity across a collection of maps,25 was used for anchoring the ‘Bartlett’ genome with the guidance of three high-density SNP-based genetic maps with European pear genetic backgrounds as mentioned above. The multiple collinearity scan toolkit (MCScanX)38 was used to perform intra-genome synteny analyses for the ‘Bartlett’ genome, and inter-genome analyses for the ‘Bartlett’ versus ‘Dangshansuli’ genomes, and ‘Bartlett’ genome versus the genome of apple cultivar ‘Golden Delicious’.3. Results3.1. Merging multiple genetic maps leads to a high quality and density integrated SSR and SNP-based consensus map of pearNine published pear genetic maps (Table 1) constructed mainly using SSR and SNP markers were integrated into a consensus genetic map I-PCG, using SSR markers in common and the software MergeMap. The number of markers for these maps ranged from 105 for HS-JJSHS17 to 3,241 for BYHxDS-JXB.10 Among these, BYHxDS-JXB had the most SNP markers (3,143) and BYHxDS-PMBR19 had the most SSR markers (734). The integrated SSR and SNP-based pear consensus genetic map (I-PCG map) consisted of 17 LGs made up of 5,085 markers in total (1,232 SSRs, and 3,853 SNPs), spanning 3,266 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.64 cM (Table 3; markers listed in Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Fig. 2, a large proportion (75.8%) of the markers in the map were SNPs, from a minimum of 63.3% on LG 16 (abbreviated as LG16, same as below), to 90.2% on LG5. SSR markers were interspersed with SNP markers in almost all parts of the 17 LGs, except about 75.5 cM at the lower end of LG5, which contained only one SSR marker, and the top 56.5 cM of LG12, which contained no SNP markers. The LG length varied from the shortest 87.7 cM (LG4) to the longest 269.3 cM (LG15). Among the 17 LGs, only LG4 and LG7 (96.6cM) were shorter than 100cM, and eight LGs (LG3, LG9, LG10, LG11, LG12, LG14, LG15, and LG17) were longer than 200cM. The total genetic length of 3,266 cM makes I-PCG the longest pear consensus genetic map being constructed to date. On the other hand, the large number of markers in this genetic map resulted in the smallest average marker interval of 0.64 cM in pear. In addition, locus clusters were observed in all LGs (Table 3), which were defined as 5 cM regions with not <10 markers.39 In total, 3,776 markers in 237 clusters accounting for 1,185 cM length were identified in the I-PCG map (Supplementary Table S1), representing 74.3% of markers and varying from 32 markers (3 clusters) on LG1 to 471 markers (27 clusters) on LG15.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.In total, 425 common SSR markers were detected on the nine individual maps, as mentioned above, to construct the I-PCG map (Table 3, Fig. 3). Of these, 200 (47.1%) were derived from apple, 148 (34.8%) from pear genomic sequences, and 77 (18.1%) from pear EST sequences. There was a large proportion of markers from apple because few SSR markers were developed from pear before the whole genome sequences were released. Common markers on the 17 LGs varied from 15 on LG4 to 37 on LG15. Of these markers, 70% were common between two or three maps, and five markers were common on all nine individual maps: NB113a (LG3), CH03g12-2 (LG3), CH02c11 (LG10), CH02b03b (LG10), and CH04h02 (LG11).Alignment of the integrated SSR and SNP-based pear consensus genetic (I-PCG) map and the nine individual maps.

Construction of a new GBS SNP map for the ‘OH’ × ‘LBJ’ populationThe new OHxLBJ map, constructed using SNPs derived from the GBS approach, consists of 9,151 markers and spans 1,664.6 cM with an average of 0.18 cM distance between markers (Supplementary Table S4 for a summary and Supplementary Table S5 for a detailed list of markers). The SNPs are located on 1,719 ‘Bartlett’ assembly scaffolds. The information on the LG assignment from the OHxLBJ SNP array map23 enabled the assignment of LGs on the new GBS-based OHxLBJ pear genetic map in this study. The lengths of the LGs showed a wide range, from 12.3 cM (LG8) to 255.0 cM (LG17). In total, five LGs were >100 cM, and another three LGs were <50 cM, indicating that some LGs were saturated, while other LGs were partially covered. In addition, we noticed high-level marker co-segregation in this map; for instance, 403 SNP markers on LG1 were located in 24 unique genetic positions, suggesting 16.8 markers per unique genetic position for LG1. Overall, there were 428 unique genetic positions on this GBS-based OHxLBJ map, and on average 21.4 markers per unique genetic position, with an average interval of 4.05 cM.3.3. Improvement of ‘Bartlett’ genome assembly anchoring by multiple high-density mapsSince genetic maps were commonly used for anchoring scaffolds into pseudo-chromosomes, we evaluated the potential application of the I-PCG map and three high-density SNP-based pear genetic maps with European pear background to improve the ‘Bartlett’ v1.0 genome assembly. The PH-CG map23 consisted of 1,740 markers and spanned 2,773.3 cM (Supplementary Table S2 for a summary, Supplementary Table S3 for a detailed list), while the new OHxLBJ consisted of 9,151 markers and spanned 1,664.6 cM (Supplementary Table S4 for a summary and Supplementary Table S5 for a detailed list). A brief overview of the maps is shown in Table 4. Using these maps, a total of 291.5 Mb ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 genome assembly was obtained in 17 pseudo-chromosomes, increasing the assembly ratio to 50.5% (Table 5 for a summary and Supplementary Table S6 for a list of scaffold ordering). Pseudo-chromosome 1 (abbreviated as Chr1, same as below) was the shortest (10.3 Mb) and Chr15 was the longest (28.2 Mb), which were the same with the ‘Dangshansuli’ genome: the shortest of 10.7 Mb for Chr1 and the longest of 43.6 Mb for Chr15. In apple, the longest pseudo-chromosome was also Chr15 (55.8 Mb), but the shortest one was Chr16 (23.5 Mb) (Fig. 4).

X-axis means pseudo-chromosome size, million bases (Mb) as unit, and Y-axis means chromosome number.Synteny analyses for the new ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 genome assembly against ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ genomes were performed (Fig. 5). Intra-genome synteny analyses of ‘Bartlett’ genome (Fig. 5A) identified homologous pseudo-chromosome pairs as per previous reports22,40: 1–7, 2–7, 2–15, 3–11, 4–12, 5–10, 6–14, 8–15, 9–17, 12–14 and 13–16. Additionally, we identified four segmental duplication regions for pseudo-chromosome pairs 6–13, 9–13, 14–16 and 14–17, which were also confirmed by inter-genome synteny analyses between the ‘Bartlett’ pear and ‘Golden Delicious’ apple genomes. Inter-genome synteny analyses between both pear genomes of ‘Bartlett’ and ‘Dangshansuli’ (Fig. 5B) showed good collinearity. The near-linear arrangement of homologous regions for all 17 corresponding pseudo-chromosomes was observed. Nonetheless, the arrangements of Chr1, Chr2, Chr3 and Chr5 were not as well aligned as other pseudo-chromosomes. Interestingly, inter-genome synteny analyses between ‘Bartlett’ and the apple genome of ‘Golden Delicious’ (Fig. 5C), both in the subfamily Maloideae, showed not only good collinearity, but also homologous relationships, similar to the ‘Bartlett’ intra-genome synteny analyses. This phenomenon was also observed when inter-genome synteny analysis was performed between ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ (data not shown), indicating the unique genome structure for apple.(A) Intra-genome synteny for the ‘Bartlett’ (P. communis) v1.1 pseudo-chromosomes; (B) Inter-genome synteny for the ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 and ‘Dangshansuli’ (P. bretschneideri) pseudo-chromosomes; (C) Inter-genome synteny for the ‘Bartlett’ v1,1 and ‘Golden Delicious’ (Malus × domestica) pseudo-chromosomes.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.4. Comparison of the I-PCG map with genome assemblies of pear and apple revealed both collinearity and misalignmentsTo further evaluate the collinearity between the pear genetic and physical maps, we compared the I-PCG map with the new ‘Bartlett’ v 1.1 (Fig. 6A), ‘Dangshansuli’ and apple genome assemblies (Fig. 6B). In total, 4,036, 4,157 and 3,707 markers were mapped onto the ‘Bartlett’ ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ genome assemblies, and among these, 3,622, 4,069 and 3,707 markers were mapped on pseudo-chromosomes, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Fig. 6A, the I-PCG map and the new ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 genome assembly displayed good collinearity. The uniformity of the genetic map with the physical maps could also be observed in the ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ (Fig. 6B), but with more misalignments (markers were not located on corresponding pseudo-chromosomes). For ‘Bartlett’, 3,427 markers (94.6% of markers mapped on pseudo-chromosomes) were located in the corresponding pseudo-chromosomes, 3,649 markers (89.7%) for ‘Dangshansuli’, and 2,117 markers (57.1%) for ‘Golden Delicious’. Among these, 3,414 markers were located in corresponding pseudo-chromosomes in at least two of the above three genome assemblies (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, misaligned markers between the I-PCG map and ‘Bartlett’ genome assembly were enriched in five LG/Chr pairs (at least five markers for each LG/Chr pair): 1–7, 9–17, 3–11, 13–16 and 6–14. For the ‘Dangshansuli’ genome, they were enriched in six LG/Chr pairs (at least 17 markers for each LG/Chr pair): 1–7, 11–15, 8–15, 3–11, 5–11 and 13–16. For ‘Golden Delicious’, they were enriched in nine LG/Chr pairs (at least 41 markers for each LG/Chr pair): 5–10, 3–11, 1–7, 9–17, 13–16, 8–15, 2–15, 6–14 and 1–15. Overall, comparing the I-PCG map with the ‘Dangshansuli’, ‘Bartlett’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ assemblies confirmed the reliability of the consensus genetic map.Alignment of the integrated SSR and SNP-based pear consensus genetic (I-PCG) map with (A) ‘Bartlett’ pseudo-chromosomes (Pc), (B) ‘Dangshansuli’ (Pb) and apple (Md) pseudo-chromosomes.

DiscussionCommon methods to build high-density genetic maps with NGS usually start with genotyping individuals in a hybrid population through reduced-genome complexity technologies, such as RADseq,41 GBS,27 and SLAF-Seq.42 In this study, we merged published pear genetic maps by treating common SSR markers presented in maps from multiple sources as bridging markers and constructed an integrated SSR and SNP-based pear consensus genetic map (the I-PCG map). The advantages of merging genetic maps include integrating multiple population maps, obtaining larger genetic maps, discovering the genome and genetic variation, and resolving conflicts between different maps. Nevertheless, the length of the consensus genetic map could be inflated (>3,000 cM in this study) due to the method used to develop the consensus map, i.e. artifact of the merging process, not true recombination. Thus, the consensus genetic map may be more relevant to the relative positioning of markers than the absolute distances between them.43Anchoring scaffold sequences into pseudo-chromosomes requires both high-quality scaffold sequences and high-quality genetic maps.25,44 In this study, we selected three high-quality maps with European pear genetic backgrounds for re-anchoring the ‘Bartlett’ scaffolds. The constructed pseudo-chromosomes captured 291.5 Mb of the ‘Bartlett’ genome sequence and dramatically increased the anchored ‘Bartlett’ genome from 29.7% in the original assembly to 50.5% in version 1.1. The improvement of a larger ratio for ‘Bartlett’ genome assembly was due to the higher density genetic maps used compared with the original assembly, which contained 1,391 Malus SNPs, and 888 P. communis SNPs.26 In this study, we used a 5.4-fold number of SNP markers, including 2,668 from the BYH map, 1,404 from the PH-CG map, and 8,181 from the OHxLBJ map (Table 5), ensuring the capture of more ‘Bartlett’ scaffolds. Synteny analyses of the new ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 assembly indicated an extensive conserved genome collinearity with P. bretschneideri ‘Dangshansuli’ and Malus × domestica ‘Golden Delicious’, indicating that the new ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 is consistent with its closely related species. Furthermore, the homologous pseudo-chromosome pairing relationships demonstrated by intra-genome synteny analyses were similar with previous studies in ‘Dangshansuli’22 and ‘Golden Delicious’,40 indicating that the genome structure of the new ‘Bartlett’ v1.1 genome assembly was correct. However, we noticed that four pseudo-chromosomes of ‘Bartlett’ did not have such good collinearity with ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ as other pseudo-chromosomes, namely Chr1, Chr2, Chr3, and Chr5, and that there were a number of dispersed collinear regions. These were possibly due to differences in the genome structure between ‘Bartlett’ and the other two genomes. On the other hand, this assembly ratio was still lower than that for ‘Dangshansuli’, which accounted for 75.5% of the genome. This may be the result of the genetic maps we used not capturing more scaffold sequences, although we used 5.4 times more SNP markers than for the original ‘Bartlett’ genome assembly. Also, the scaffold N50 length of the ‘Bartlett’ genome assembly was 88 kb compared with 540.8 kb of the ‘Dangshansuli’ one, which made it difficult to capture more scaffold sequences.25 Overall, we significantly improved the ‘Bartlett’ genome assembly, but more work is required for further improvement, especially a better quality scaffold assembly, which is the target of a recent initiative by an international European pear genome consortium.The integrated I-PCG map was compared with the improved ‘Bartlett’ v1.1, ‘Dangshansuli’22 and ‘Golden Delicious’40 genome assemblies. Both collinearity and misalignment of markers were observed for this comparison, indicating that the I-PCG map we constructed was reliable, but both the pear genetic and physical map are far from being complete. The reason for the misalignment may be repeat content or genome-wide duplication in the pear and apple genomes.45 The results demonstrated that most misaligned markers were coordinated with homologous pairs identified in the pear and apple genomes. Furthermore, there were 42.9% misaligned markers for the apple genome of ‘Golden Delicious’, much higher than the 5.4% and 10.3% for the ‘Bartlett’ and ‘Dangshansuli’ genomes, respectively, indicating the much difference between pear and apple. In addition, similar homologous pseudo-chromosome pairing relationships were revealed by both comparisons of the consensus map and synteny analyses of the genome assembly of pear, which was the first step for further integration of genetic and physical maps in the future.In conclusion, we demonstrated that a set of different pear genetic maps is a valuable resource for map integration and genetic comparison, which has been exploited in anchoring genome scaffolds of European pear ‘Bartlett’ (P. communis). It was proved that the abundant common markers could be merged into a consensus map, resulting in an integrated SSR and SNP-based pear consensus genetic map with the highest marker density to date. It consists of 5,085 markers and spans 3,266.0 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.64 cM.

Ribo-Seq analysis also makes possible to detect preferred codons without information on genes function.1. IntroductionUsage of synonymous codons is biased in genomes, as some codons are favoured in highly expressed genes.1,2 This phenomenon, called codon usage bias (CUB), has been observed in most genomes, although it seems to vary according to the complexity of genomes.1 The choice of codons seems to depend mainly on tRNA pool: the main hypothesis is that using codons that have the greatest number of accepting tRNAs increases the efficiency or accuracy of translation of highly expressed genes.3,4 In addition to its impact on mRNA translation, CUB has an impact on protein folding.5,6 Despite its importance, precise measures of CUB were, for years, difficult to obtain at genome wide scale. Sharp et al.7 developed a clustering approach from a set of sequenced genes: the RSCU for Relative Synonymous Codon Usage. This measure is inferred with a statistical process: two clusters of genes are determined based on expression levels, in order to maximize the difference in RSCU between the two groups, then the RSCU is computed using the codon frequencies within each group. Consequently, RSCU accuracy relies on the number of sequenced genes. Here, we propose a new method that permits to directly compute CUB from all translated genes. A recent technique named ribosome profiling (or Ribo-seq) has revolutionized the analysis of translation and permitted to refine the picture of global gene expression control. Ribo-seq is based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPF or “footprints”) and permits genome-wide analysis of translated sequences at nucleotide resolution. From a bioinformatic standpoint, Ribo-seq provides a new type of data: indeed, RPF reveal codon occupancy of active ribosomes.8 This technique yields a precise picture of translation by quantifying the number of ribosomes at every position in a genome. Researchers often analyse jointly Ribo-seq data and RNA-seq data and compare the number of mRNAs and the number of mRNAs involved in translation, which allows them to measure the efficiency of translation.9,10,11,12,13 We decided to use only Ribo-seq data to measure CUB, based on a simple rationale: the more observed footprints, the more ribosomes at this position. This means that genes with a high coverage are highly translated, and mutations that lead to a benefit in terms of translation are more prone to be fixed in those genes: as a consequence, Ribo-seq could indicate which genes have a strong CUB. Ribo-seq is often used to measure translation efficiency, as the number of ribosomes per copy of an mRNA species. Here highly translated (which differs from efficiently translated) means that all copies of one mRNA species yield, all together, a large number of proteins.We ranked genes according to their number of footprints in a precise and limited region of their mRNA (from the 20th to the 200th codons from the start codon). We then split genes into two groups according to their number of footprints and measured codon bias within each group: this way, our two groups are not optimized for RSCU, but derived from translation experiments. Moreover, contrary to previous approaches, we used high-throughput data reflecting the number of ribosomes per sequence and use all translated genes. Therefore, our measure of CUB is directly computed from translational data.We applied our approach on a variety of genomes from a parasite, like Plasmodiumfalciparum, to multicellular eukaryotes like Caenorhabditiselegans and Homosapiens. We corroborate Sharp’s results on yeast and C. elegans,7,14 but also detect preferred codons in every species. A preferred codon of an amino acid is defined as the codon with the highest frequency in highly expressed genes. Our analysis provides novel insights on the evolution of CUB.2. Materials and methods2.1. ORF selectionSequences and annotations were collected from NCBI for all organisms. Positions of start codons are crucial in this study. Therefore, we first kept all genes with a unique isoform. Genes with multiple isoforms were rejected if they had different start codons. If all isoforms share the same start codon, we kept the longest common coding sequence. We excluded the mRNAs of mitochondrial genes. Finally, we collected all the spliced mRNA sequences of the selected genes.2.2. Ribo-seq data and mappingAll Ribo-seq data come from already published data (Supplementary Table S1). We chose species belonging to opisthokonts (the Fungi/Metazoa group) for which Ribo-seq data were available and used P. falciparum as an outgroup because of its restricted set of tRNA genes compared to all other species considered in this study. When several datasets were available for one species, we selected datasets according to three conditions: 1/availability of a replicate, 2/ribosome profiling that closely follows the protocol of Ingolia et al.,8 and 3/a sufficient sequencing depth after quality filtering. For each selected dataset, we plot the footprint position with respect to the start codon for all genes and determined the majority peak near the start. For all experiments, the peak turns out to be at -12 nucleotides upstream from start codon. As explained in the study by Ingolia et al.,8 the “shift” applied to the positions of mapped reads was set to 12 nucleotides.Reads were mapped with CRAC15 with a k-mer of length 25: this k-mer is longer than the recommended length for RNA-seq to better fit the short length of RPF. After mapping on mRNA, we took the first position of each read and applied a shift of 12 nucleotides to assign the read to the P-site position of ribosomes.162.3. Categorizing genes into lowly and highly translated genesFor each gene, we computed the coverage by ribosome footprints from the 20th to the 200th codons from the start codon (and at least 20 codons before the stop codon). We computed the mean coverage on the selected region after removal all genes having less than 10 footprints. Then, we ranked genes according to this mean coverage. From this ranking, we create two groups that were made uniform in terms of total amount of footprints: the lowly and highly translated genes. To accentuate the contrast between those two groups, we excluded the top 5% of lowly translated genes and the bottom 5% of highly translated genes.2.4. RSCU computingFinally, we computed the RSCU as defined by Sharp et al.7 within each group (lowly and highly translated genes). Instead of computing the bias of codon usage over the whole ORF, we took sequences from the 20th to the 200th codons from the start codon, i.e. the same region as the one used for gene sorting. For clarity, when the RSCU is computed based on Ribo-seq data, we named it RSCURS. We developed a computer program in Java language to perform this computation (see the Availability section).2.5. Copy number of tRNA genes and clusteringWe use the number of tRNA genes of a species as a proxy for the size of its tRNA pool.17,18 We obtained the copy numbers of tRNA genes from the latest version (2.0 from 2016) of the Genomic tRNA Database (GtRNAdb)19 for all species, but Histoplasma capsulatum. For the latter, we used the Genbank annotation from NCBI database. To cluster species according to their tRNA copy number and according to their average RSCURS, we perform hierarchical clustering with the R software using the Canberra distance with UPGMA algorithm (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). Details are provided in Supplementary Material.3. Results and discussionOnly amino acids that have multiple encoding codons are studied: only 59 codons were used as we excluded ATG (methionine), TGG (tryptophan), and stop codons.3.1. CUB computationSharp and Bradnam14 have computed RSCU for C. elegans, and we compared his results with our method (RSCURS, for RSCU by Ribo-seq) as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The two methods split genes in two categories: highly and lowly expressed genes, but with completely different inputs: Sharp et al. computed codon bias with a statistical model based on gene sequences, while we used only Ribo-seq footprints. Nevertheless, we obtained a high correlation (>0.97) between Sharp's measure and ours. This correlation is even higher within replicates. In 1992, Lloyd and Sharp20 published RSCU values for highly expressed genes in Candidaalbicans. Here again, the comparison with RSCU values is shown in Fig. 1B, and we observed a very high correlation between RSCU and RSCURS (>0.98). In both experiments, we used a larger set of genes (Supplementary Table S1A).Comparison of the strength of codon usage bias as measured by the RSCU as originally defined by Sharp et al., and by the RSCURS which is introduced in this work. Both measures are plotted for a subset of highly expressed genes. The RSCU is computed for each codon of an amino acid: it multiplies the relative observed frequency of this codon among all possible codons for the corresponding amino acid by the number of possible codons. In all graphs, the codons on x-axis are ordered by increasing RSCU values computed by Sharp et al. (A) Comparison of RSCU values of Sharp and RSCURS values in C. elegans (in two replicates). Both replicate curves for RSCURS are extremely close from each other, and they closely follow that from Sharp. (B) Comparison of RSCU values of Sharp and RSCURS values in C. albicans. (C) and (D). Comparison of eight RSCURS curves obtained with codons counts computed in different ranges of codons starting with 20th codon and ending between the 50th and the 400th codons, respectively, in C. elegans (C) and in C. albicans (D). Apart for the smallest range of codons (i.e. [20-50]) all curves are very close to each other, thereby showing the robustness of with respect to the range of codons taken into account. One observes that RSCURS values reach higher values in the yeast species than in the worm species.

One observes that RSCURS values reach higher values in the yeast species than in the worm species. Refer to the online version for colors.We question whether our method, RSCURS, is robust with respect to the range of codons used—by default [20, 200] codons. The lower limit of 20 avoids counting the accumulation of RPF due to translation initiation.8 The upper limit of 200 was chosen as a minimum length for including sufficient counts and to maximize the number of mRNAs taken into account. Clearly, the upper limit choice is somehow arbitrary. We computed the RSCURS for eight different upper limits ranging from 50 to 400 codons. The RSCURS curves for each range are shown on a single graph in Fig. 1B for C. elegans and Fig. 1C for C. albicans. The agreement among all eight curves is striking for both species. Only the curves of two shortest ranges—[20-50] and [20,100] —depart slightly from the other curves, indicating that a minimum number of codons is necessary to capture a stable signal. All other curves are very close to each other, showing that the RSCURS results are not strongly dependent of the upper limit. Hence, RSCURS appears to be robust with respect to this parameter. Since the curve for range [20,200] is highly correlated with Sharp's curves, logically all eight curves are highly correlated with Sharp's RSCU values as well.3.2. CUB exists in all speciesAs a first step, we computed the Euclidean distance of RSCURS between highly and lowly translated genes (Fig. 2A) as a mean to evaluate the intensity of CUB for each organism: if this distance is close to 0, it means there are very few differences in codon usage between highly and lowly translated genes. Results gave two clearly distinct species groups. The first group corresponds to species with a lower CUB and comprises mammals, Drosophila, P. falciparum, and H. capsulatum. The second group of species exhibiting a higher CUB contains three yeasts and C. elegans.Differences in codon usage bias between lowly and highly translated genes. (A) Euclidean distance between RSCURS of lowly and highly translated genes was computed for ten species. This distance clearly partitions the species in two groups: the mean euclidean distance is 1.51 for group 1 (left, in orange), and is 6.64 for group 2 (right, in grey). Group 2 comprises C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and C. elegans, while group 1 comprises all vertebrates, D. melanogaster, P. falciparum and H. capsulatum. (B) For each species, comparison of the RSCURS of all codons between lowly and highly translated genes (ltg vs htg). Codons from group 1 species (containing the vertebrates) are shown as orange circles, while codons from group 2 species (that of the budding yeast) as gray circles. A point near the diagonal indicates a similar behavior in ltg and htg. The further apart the point from the diagonal, the higher the bias of that codon.

A point near the diagonal indicates a similar behavior in ltg and htg. The further apart the point from the diagonal, the higher the bias of that codon. Refer to the online version for colors.For these species, we compare the RSCURS of all codons between lowly and highly translated genes (ltg vs htg; Fig. 2B). One notices the asymmetry of the diagram with respect to the diagonal: The part of the diagram beyond a RSCURS of two is populated above the diagonal and almost empty below it. This confirms the existence of favoured codons in htg, and their absence in ltg. Codons located far above the diagonal indicate strongly favoured codons in htg. This illustrates the impact of selection pressure linked to the gene expression level. There also exist codons far below the diagonal (which are disfavoured in htg), but their RSCURS remains low (<2): those are either disfavoured or slightly favoured in ltg. Some codons even exhibit a nearly null RSCURS in htg, meaning these are almost forbidden in htg. Apart from the global asymmetry, the difference between the codons of the two species groups is striking. All codons far apart from the diagonal belong to group 2 and very few codons of these species lie near the diagonal: in a species like yeast, the difference of usage between htg and ltg is strong for most codons. Note also that in group 2, some codons are disfavoured in htg and favoured in ltg, suggesting there could be some selection pressure also in ltg, albeit weaker than in htg. In species of group 1, most codons lie around the diagonal, but the bias changes with the RSCURS value: most codons that are disfavoured in htg (dots lying below the horizontal line, i.e. with a RSCURS in htg <1) lie below the diagonal, while most codons favoured in htg (i.e. a RSCURS in htg > 1) lie above the diagonal. This suggests that codon usage preference in htg is small, but is detectable with Ribo-seq data, and thus do exist also in these species.3.3. Patterns of codon preferencesThen, we compared the frequency of codons in highly translated genes. Higher eukaryotes have few strongly preferred codons while yeasts show marked differences (Fig. 3A): some yeasts present a highly preferred codon for Arginine, Glutamic acid and Cysteine, whereas mammals and Drosophila do not. Glutamine follows remarkable patterns: both mammals and Drosophila strongly prefer CAG, yeasts favour CAA, while H. capsulatum and C. elegans use CAA/CAG in an equivalent fashion.(A) Preferred codons in highly translated genes. To ease the comparison of the bias across codons, we plotted the codon frequency such that each codon has a value comprised in [0,1]. The frequency is the RSCU multiplied by the number of codons for the corresponding amino acid. The range of colors goes from blue for a frequency of 0 until red for a frequency of 1.

Refer to the online version for colors.Our analysis revealed that some preferred codons are well conserved (Table 1): all species, but P. falciparum, have the same preferred codon for phenylalanine, histidine, tyrosine (that is, all aromatic amino acids that can be studied), and asparagine. On the opposite, Leucine has five different preferred codons. Indeed, unique preferred codons are rare: Schizosaccharomycespombe has one only for proline (CCT), and P. falciparum has the highest number of unique features with seven unique preferred codons.

Refer to the online version for colors.3.4. Preferred codons and tRNA copy numberIt is assumed that a codon with the highest copy number of corresponding tRNAs is prone to be the preferred codon. This result is confirmed in all species, but H. capsulatum (Table 2). Nevertheless, species do not equally observe this tendency: in S. pombe 15 out 18 amino acids prefer the codon with the highest copy number of tRNA, while only 9-12 amino acids behave the same in mammals. Non-majority preferred codons are shared among species, like species preferring GGT for glycine (S. pombe, Saccharomycescerevisiae and C.albicans) or preferring GCC for Alanine (H. sapiens, Musmusculus, Rattusnorvegicus, Drosophilamelanogaster, C. elegans and H. capsulatum). Comparison of favourite codons and tRNA copy numbers(The codons for Stop, Met and Trp are excluded). tRNA: transfer RNA. Copy numbers of tRNA genes come from GtRNAdb 2.019. The percentage of favourite codons (one per amino acid) that have the highest tRNA copy number lies above 50% for all species but H. capsulatum.Comparison of favourite codons and tRNA copy numbers(The codons for Stop, Met and Trp are excluded). tRNA: transfer RNA. Copy numbers of tRNA genes come from GtRNAdb 2.019. The percentage of favourite codons (one per amino acid) that have the highest tRNA copy number lies above 50% for all species but H. capsulatum.We inferred two species trees based on the species' proximity either in terms of tRNA copy number, or in terms of average RSCURS over highly translated genes (Fig. 3B and C). These trees are similar, but not equal. tRNA copy number groups the mammals with Drosophila and S. cerevisiae, and makes a clade with C. albicans, S. pombe and C. elegans, while both H. capsulatum and P. falciparum form an outgroup (which reflects their small tRNA gene copy numbers; see Table 2). With CUB (Fig. 3C), the clade grouping the mammals and Drosophila remains opposed to the branches containing the yeast species and P. falciparum. The striking feature is the position of H. capsulatum, which, due to its low tRNA gene number, is located at the base the tRNA-tree, but it is grouped with the mammals in the CUB-tree. Despite its basal position in the tree, H. capsulatum is closer to the group of yeasts (Euclidian distance = 29.9) than to the group of mammals (Euclidian distance = 86.5).3.5. Preferred codons, codons lacking tRNA and GC contentWobbling corresponds to a codon that is decoded without following Watson–Crick base pair rules.21 Wobbling is complex to study, but codons lacking tRNA are necessarily subject to it. In Fig. 3D, we compared the numbers of codons lacking tRNA, and of preferred codons lacking tRNA for all species ordered by the size of their tRNA pool. As expected, when the tRNA pool increases, the number of codons lacking tRNA decreases steeply (slope equals -0.026642). However, the number of preferred codons lacking tRNA remains stable and appears not to depend on the size of the tRNA pool (slope dashed curve equals -0.002812).The last base of a codon is supposed to correlate with the GC content of a genome. This result is partially confirmed in Fig. 4. On one extremity, P. falciparum has a very low GC content and no preferred codon ending with a G or C. At the other extremity, all species with a high GC content strongly prefer codons ending with a G or C. For intermediate values of GC content, results are more puzzling: C. elegans has an intermediate GC content compared to C. albicans, S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, but has a much stronger preference for codons ending with a G or C.Genome percentage of GC bases (GC %) versus GC % of last base of preferred codons.

Conclusion and discussionCUB measures the difference in the frequency of translation of each possible codon for an amino acid. CUB is detected in highly expressed genes because the selection pressure to choose optimal codons is stronger in those genes. First, it is known that numerous mRNAs are finally not translated22 and have thus no impact on fitness. Hence, to measure CUB, Ribo-seq seems more appropriate to select highly expressed genes than RNA-seq data. Second, various forces and processes (such as mutation bias) impact the nucleotidic composition of a gene.17 Because it captures the presence of ribosomes, Ribo-seq allows to measure the sole translational advantage of a codon rather than the impact of evolutionary forces unrelated to translation.Our method based on Ribo-seq—rather than RNA-seq—data allows us to compute a precise and direct measure of CUB. Although Ribo-seq was not originally designed for CUB studies, we show that our method assesses the CUB with high precision. Using translation data provides other benefits: first, all translated genes can be included even if functional information is lacking. Second, our method avoids any statistical optimization as CUB is directly computed from translation data. Third, Ribo-seq data allows to compute CUB and to detect preferred codons in a wide variety of species. Fourth, our method may help to measure variation of CUB across conditions or tissues. Nevertheless, the number of Ribo-seq footprints per gene depends on the sequencing depth, which may introduce some bias if depth is low. To correctly classify genes, this method also requires a good sequencing depth in order to get at least some footprints on lowly translated genes: for example, we can grossely estimate that it requires at least 3,000 covered genes to study human's CUB.Our method was validated by comparison to previous results and our results confirm the current knowledge on CUB. First, the CUB is stronger in highly translated genes.7 Second, most higher eukaryotes exhibit a weaker CUB when compared to unicellular species, like yeasts.17 Third, tRNA copy number has a strong influence on preferred codons, as they indicate preferred codons for most of amino acids.18 Nevertheless, the tRNA copy number is not the only criterion: the GC content also influences preferred codons, but to a lesser extent than the tRNA pool. The clustering of pluricellular species in Fig. 3B and C suggests that translation can adapt to a changing GC content. Surprisingly, an increasing tRNA pool size does not diminish the number of preferred codons lacking tRNA.Ribo-seq data on a larger set of species would help to get a better understanding of CUB evolution, but to date, only very few species have been subjected to Ribo-seq experiments. Nevertheless, comparison of codon bias between species seems to reveal a common story that is partially adapted by every organism. In yeast, the level of ribosome occupancy measured using an adequate protocol was found to be negatively correlated with tRNA copy numbers, which is used as a proxy of cognate tRNA abundances.13 Our results suggest that the tRNA pool is the key factor for every amino acid in a wide range of species, and that some preferred codons are conserved across the tree of life. However, we clearly distinguished two species groups when comparing the intensities of CUB. The low-intensity group contains mammals and drosophila (plus P. falciparum that has a very restricted tRNA pool, which may be due to the difficulty of tRNA gene prediction, and H. capsulatum which we discussed later) versus a three-time higher CUB intensity group formed by C. elegans, S. pombe, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. Surprisingly, C. elegans does not belong to the low intensity group, while mammals and drosophila do. It has common features with both groups: some amino acids with a yeast-like preferences (like valine or proline), some with a mammals-like preferences (like glutamic acid or aspartic acid) and some with a unique profile (glycine and leucine). A possible scenario could be a decreasing intensity of CUB in multicellular species: nonetheless, this evolution would be achieved progressively, amino acid by amino acid (often through a substitution at the third base of a codon23—see examples below). Highly translated genes are more subjected to CUB than lowly translated genes and, as shown in Table 1, a general pattern appears from yeasts to mammals: an evolution CAT to CAC for Histidine, from GCT to GCC in Alanine, for example. This general pattern admits some exceptions: for instance, H. capsulatum and C. elegans favour GTC for valine whereas the common pattern favours an evolution from GTT to GTG. Besides the general tendencies, CUB evolution is to some degree dependent of the species, as suggested by some species specific preferred codons. Including more species would help to further unravel the evolution of CUB, or to investigate the generality of its impacts that were detected only in some species24,25; thus we hope that Ribosome profiling will be applied to an increasing number of species.The most striking results were obtained for the pathogenic yeast, H. capsulatum. Its tRNA pool is closer to that of other yeasts, but its CUB much closer to that of mammals. This suggests that its CUB is quite independent of its tRNA pool. As H. capsulatum is a pathogen of mammals, it is tempting to say that it adapts to its host, but we lack information to conclude. Is H. capsulatum able to use the translational machinery of its host (ribosomes and/or tRNAs) or do more tRNA genes remain to be annotated in its genome? Including other pathogenic species in the comparison, such as the fungi Aspergillus, would help to determine whether this feature is specific to H. capsulatum or widespread in pathogens.

Transcription factors (TFs) act to modulate gene expression through complex cis-regulatory element (CRE) interactions. Genome-wide analysis of known plant CREs was performed for all currently predicted protein-coding gene promoters in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Many CREs such as abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive, drought-responsive, auxin-responsive, and evening elements, exhibit bona fide CRE properties such as strong position bias towards the transcription start site (TSS) and over-representation when compared with random promoters. Genes containing these CREs are enriched in a large repertoire of plant biological pathways. Large-scale transcriptome analyses also show that these CREs are highly implicated in grapevine development and stress response. Numerous CRE-driven modules in condition-specific gene co-expression networks (GCNs) were identified and many of these modules were highly enriched for plant biological functions. Several modules corroborate known roles of CREs in drought response, pathogen defense, cell wall metabolism, and fruit ripening, whereas others reveal novel functions in plants. Comparisons with Arabidopsis suggest a general conservation in promoter architecture, gene expression dynamics, and GCN structure across species. Systems analyses of CREs provide insights into the grapevine cis-regulatory code and establish a foundation for future genomic studies in grapevine.1. IntroductionTranscription factors (TFs) regulate the transcription of target genes both spatially and temporally through the specific binding of cis-regulatory elements (CREs or ‘motifs’) present in their promoters. On average 5% of the protein-coding genes encode TFs in monocotyledon and dicotyledonous plants, which can be divided into super families, and further into families, based on their DNA-binding domains.1 To date, 58 families have been assigned for plants,1 some of them are grouped in six TF super families. Many of these TF are essential for plant cell division, development, growth, and responses to the environment.2 In the last decade, ongoing efforts in curating reported plant CREs3,4 have been fruitful, providing useful clues into the role of TFs in regulating specific promoter sequences of interest. There have been recent efforts to elucidate the TF-binding specificity in Arabidopsis at a genome-wide scale using in vitro techniques coupled to high-throughput platforms such as protein binding microarrays.5 This strategy provided valuable CRE information for a large number of TFs (63 in total) covering 25 TF families. The most widely studied CREs in plants include the ABRE (abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element) and DRE (dehydration-responsive element)/CRT (C-repeat) elements which are largely implicated in stress responses,6 CArG-box,7 AuxRE,8 and E2F-binding elements9 in plant development, and MBS elements implicated in a myriad of development processes and stress responses.10 Others CREs that belong to lesser known TF families (e.g. Golden2-like, GLK)5 or that are critical for the binding of well characterized TFs (e.g. AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR, ARF)5,11 have been recently characterized as well.Knowledge pertaining to TF and CRE repertoire has been instrumental in developing regulatory models explaining changes in gene expression patterns across organs, tissues, or in response to stress in Arabidopsis5,12–14 and some crop species.15,16 Approaches that consider the absence/presence of CREs, the distribution of CRE positions, or their over-representation (ratio of observed/random expectation) have all been used to establish transcriptional regulatory models in plants13,15,17 and mammals.18 Many of these studies have highlighted that CREs having a position bias towards the transcription start site (TSS) are more likely to be bona fide CREs functioning in important biological roles. Other sophisticated models that consider CRE combinatorial rules12,16 or its integration with gene co-expression networks (GCNs)5,12–14 have also been favored. In GCNs, genes are represented as nodes, and edges connecting any two nodes depict similarity in expression profile across different organs/tissues, developmental stages, and/or stress conditions. GCNs can be further classified into ‘condition-independent’ or ‘condition-specific’ GCNs, representing relationships inferred from multiple experimental conditions or in determined conditions (e.g. abiotic stress, biotic stress, or tissue-specificity), respectively.19 Lineage-specific GCNs have also been explored.20,21 Systems-based approaches, such as the integration of CREs, promoter architecture, and GCNs analysis, are promising methodologies to infer gene function,22 and are complementary to other network inference methods such as associologs—orthologous gene associations—and genome context similarities.23Grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) are amongst the world’s major fruit crops and are highly valued for fresh fruit consumption and winemaking. The grapevine genome24 provides a strong foundation for elucidating the molecular genetics involved in grapevine physiology and response to environment. Specifically, seminal studies involving large-scale gene expression profiling have revealed important mechanisms and biomarkers critical for grapevine development across organs/tissues25,26 and berry phenotypic plasticity (e.g. genotype × environment interactions).27 The availability of the grapevine genome and the rapid accumulation of publicly available grapevine whole-genome microarray and RNA-seq datasets provide the raw material necessary for GCN and CRE analyses. To date, several studies have utilized GCN and CRE analyses in revealing biologically relevant target genes of grapevine TFs28–30 and/or providing clues into the regulatory relationships of TFs in key metabolic and ripening pathways.31,32 However, to date no study has characterized grapevine promoter architecture and identified putative CRE regulatory modules at a genome-wide scale.In this study, the distribution and organization of promoter CREs and their properties were analysed for all currently predicted protein-coding genes in grapevine. Further insights into the biological role(s) of genes containing these CREs were achieved through analysis of enriched plant biological pathways. Meta-analysis of next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets and the grapevine tissue developmental atlas revealed the importance of many CREs in stress and developmental regulation. A bottom-up strategy was adopted to identify regulatory modules potentially driven by CREs in both stress- and development-specific GCNs. We apply a robust approach by integrating different layers of information—promoter architecture, gene expression, and GCNs—to identify the cis-regulatory code during environment stress, growth, and/or development in grapevine. The insights of this study will allow the prioritization of CREs and gene candidates for functional characterization in grapevines.2. Materials and methods2.1. Discovery of known plant CREs in grapevine promotersCandidate plant CREs, were compiled from two plant promoter databases, namely AGRIS4 and PLACE,3 and from protein-binding microarray inferred CREs of 25 Arabidopsis TF families.5 A total of 559 non-redundant CREs were retained for subsequent analysis. The promoters of the grapevine genes were downloaded from EnsemblPlants using Biomart (http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html; 1 March 2016, date last accessed). Sequences between -1 to -1,000 bp upstream of each gene TSS containing < 10% N sequences were deemed as candidate promoter sequence of each gene. All 559 non-redundant CREs were scanned for exact pattern match (no mismatch) across 29,839 promoters on both + and – strands, and indexed for the number of occurrence, strand, and position information.2.2. Positional bias and fold-change enrichment analysis of CREs in grapevine promotersEach CRE was evaluated for positional bias using two popular approaches; the clustering factor (CF),18 and a recently proposed index, the Z-score.13 Another approach based on the fold-change/enrichment between observed/expected frequencies with resampling was considered.15 For the CF calculation, the number of occurrences of each CRE in each bin (50 bases, 20 bins total) was calculated. Based on the abundance of the CRE in the 20 bins, the mean (x¯) and standard deviation (s) were calculated. A second mean (x¯ ') and a second standard deviation (s') were calculated based only on bin values that were < 2s above x¯. Then the CF is calculated with the equation: CF = (xmax - x¯ ')/(s'). The Z-score,13 for a given CRE was calculated considering every gene in the mutual rank (MR) network(s). The Z-score for each CRE is calculated with the equation: Z-score = (L/2 + p)/v[((L - l + 1) ^2 - 1)/n], where L corresponds to the length of the promoter, l corresponds to the length of the motif, n corresponds the number of instances that the CRE is found in the promoters of the genes, and p corresponds to the mean position from all the instances the CRE was found. For the fold-change/enrichment (FE) calculation, the observed frequency is calculated as in the Z-score, based on the number of instances that the CRE was found in the promoters, and the expected frequency was calculated by performing 1,000 replicates of random sampling with equal sizes (number of genes containing the selected CRE).2.3. Compilation of transcriptome datasets, differential expression (DE), and comparative gene expression analysisTwo different compilations of databases were made: a stress-related compendia, which was mainly derived from next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets publicly available from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra; last accessed 01/03/2016), and a grapevine tissue developmental series (atlas), based on the NimbleGen Grape Whole-genome microarray platform. For RNA-seq datasets, quality control of raw single- and pair-end FASTQ reads were performed with Trimmomatic v0.36,33 ensuring all reads maintained a minimum Q score of 20 and a length of 40. Bowtie2 v2.2.734 was used with default parameters for read alignments using the 12× grapevine reference genome PN40024.24 Read summarization was performed with htseq-count v0.6.1 using the 12x V1 annotation with default settings.35,DESeq236 was used for the DE analysis of the stress (RNA-seq) datasets, comparing the experiments’ treatments against controls. For the grapevine atlas dataset, DE analysis was performed using limma37 comparing the development progression from young to mature of each organ, except flower-, seedling-, and root-specific tissues. A threshold of false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and absolute log2FC > 1 represents significant DE genes identified through DESeq2 and limma in each comparison. Estimation of RNA-seq derived transcript abundance was performed with DESeq2 by applying variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) while pre-normalized probe intensities (using Robust Multi-Array Average), were gathered from.25 All predicted grapevine-Arabidopsis orthologues were downloaded from EnsemblPlants (http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html; 1 March 2016, date last accessed). Expression analysis of Arabidopsis genes was conducted using the AtGenExpress compendium for the ‘stress’ and ‘pathogen’ series via the Bio-Analytic Resource for Plant biology database (http://bar.utoronto.ca/; 1 December 2016, date last accessed) expression browser tool.2.4. Construction of GCNsPrior to network construction, genes that are not DE in at least one comparison in each compendium were filtered. A final non-redundant list of DE genes in the stress-responsive and atlas compendia were obtained and used for GCN construction. Principal component analysis was performed on the RNA-seq VST dataset using R (http://www.r-project.org). Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) values were used as a measurement of expression similarity between gene pairs. Ranks were assigned to gene pairs based on the PCC values of their genes. The formula for geometric mean of the ranks, MR(AB) = v(Rank(A<U+2192>B) × Rank(B<U+2192>A)), was used to calculate the MR value for each pair-wise genes.19,20 Rank(A<U+2192>B) corresponds to the rank assigned to gene B given the list of co-expression genes from gene A, while vice versa for Rank(B<U+2192>A). For each individual network (stress and atlas), the significance of MR values was estimated based on 1,000 permutations as per.212.5. Network-based CRE subnetwork selection and functional enrichment analysisFor each gene and all immediate connected genes (nodes) forming a group, enrichment P-values for CREs in their promoters were based on hypergeometric distribution.13 From each GCN with significant MR values, genes having a given CRE enriched at P < 0.01 were then selected as ‘seed’ or ‘guide’ genes to generate the relevant CRE network. For the construction of Arabidopsis CRE network (P < 0.01), the Arabidopsis graphical Gaussian model gene network with a partial correlation threshold > 0.05 was used.13 To further identify densely connected regions (subnetworks) within each CRE network, the Girvan–Newman fast greedy algorithm was applied.38 Functional enrichment of MapMan39 ontology terms for grapevine and Arabidopsis was performed in R and terms with an FDR < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. In each CRE subnetwork, genes within selected ‘seed’ or ‘guide’ gene(s) node vicinity of up to two steps (k = 2) were extracted for further analyses. All visualization of various CRE subnetworks was performed with Cytoscape v3.4.403. Results and discussion3.1. Distribution of CREs in grapevine promotersAn evaluation of base composition is often the first step in characterizing promoter sequences of an organism. In this study, analysis of promoter sequences (1,000 bp upstream of the TSS) revealed an AT-rich ratio, where A:C:G:T composition are 0.33:0.16:0.16:0.34, respectively. Promoter sequences of Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice are also AT-rich15 which is a strong indicator of bona fide plant promoter regions.41 Therefore, promoter sequences extracted here likely reflect actual promoter regions and not random genomic regions. Rigorous statistical and DNA-binding specificity evaluation have shown that CREs between 6- and 8-mer provide an optimal threshold for capturing most biologically relevant CREs.5,16,17 Indeed, the occurrence of CREs, shorter than 6-mer or larger than 8-mer, in the promoters of the grapevine genome (Supplementary File 1) might result in a large or small number of hits, respectively, complicating the statistical evaluation for the identification of biologically relevant CREs (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). Focussing on promoter sequences containing CREs between 6- and 8-mer, three separate approaches were considered to identify biologically relevant CREs, fulfilling a positional bias towards the TSS (using CF and Z-score) and/or having high fold enrichment when compared with random occurrences in shuffled promoter sequences (using FE). CREs were seen to score differently according to each of the three approaches (Supplementary Table S1). Distribution of selected CREs in grapevine promoter sequences. CREs of each size category (4–12-mer) were ranked according to their Z-score values in descending order. The frequencies of each CRE are binned into 50 bp intervals from the TSS (0 bp) to –1,000 bp.

High and low frequencies of each CRE are depicted as red/light gray and blue/dark gray color shades, respectively. Examples of CREs and their commonly associated names are indicated in brackets. TSS, transcription start site.Several examples 6-mer CREs that are canonical TF binding sites for auxin responsive factor (AuxRE5,11,42: TGTCTC and TGTCGG), AP2/ERF superfamily (DRE43: RCCGAC and GCCGAC; and GCC-box43: GCCGCC), bZIP44 (G-box: CACGTG; and C-box: GACGTC), bHLH45,46 (G-box), and CAMTA (CGCGBOXAT47: VCGCGB) TFs showed strong position bias towards the TSS and/or were strongly over-represented. The AuxRE TGTCTC CRE had a CF (highest) and Z-score score of 5.8, was present in 9,111 promoters (n = 11,621 occurrences) with a peak position between 0 and 50 bp from the TSS, and had a FE value showing 3.3-fold more observed occurrences compared with occurrences in random promoters (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). A novel AuxRE, TGTCGG, which was recently shown to be the preferred binding site for ARFs compared with TGTCTC5,11 has a slightly different distribution profile. TGTCGG is present in fewer (4,411) promoters, with a different peak position (50–100 bp upstream of TSS), lower CF and Z-score, but with higher FE values (6.8-fold more occurrences than in random promoters). Commonly associated bZIP and bHLH binding site motif, G-box (CACGTG), was present in 6,200 promoters (n =7,956 occurrences) with a peak position between 50 and 100 bp from the TSS, and CF, Z-score, and FE, of 2.9, 6.1, and 4.8 (Supplementary Table S1). Meanwhile, the GCCGAC CRE, a component of DRE, was among the CREs with the highest FE (12.9-fold more occurrences than in random promoters), was present in 2,312 promoters (n = 2,529 occurrences), with the same peak position as G-box, with CF and Z-score of 2.9 and 3.9, respectively.Considering 8-mer CREs, several CREs potentially targeted by E2F TF9 including the GCGGGAAA (E2F1OSPCNA) and TTTCCCGC (E2FANTRNR), present in 347 (n= 360 occurrences) and 410 (n= 418 occurrences) promoters were ranked highly considering CF, Z-scores, and FE criterions. In addition, several longer instances of G-box (e.g. CACGTGGC and CCACGTGG), and other instances of bZIP TFs44 (e.g. TACGTGTC) were also highly ranked. Among the top-scoring 8-mer CREs for CF is the AGATATTT sequence, a circadian clock associated CRE, recognized by Arabidopsis MYB-related TF, CCA1, and RVE1.5,48 There were 4,120 promoters containing AGATATTT (n = 4,567 occurrences) with a peak position between 0 and 50 bp from the TSS, and a FE value of 7.2 (Supplementary Table S1).Top-scoring CREs in grapevine promoters, such as the G-box, CGCGBOXAT, DRE, GCC-box, E2F1OSPCNA, and AGATATTT, share similar promoter distribution profiles as in the promoters of other species; having a peak position within 200 bp upstream of TSS,15,17 a high Z-score (>3)13 and/or CF, or are highly over-represented compared with random promoters5,15 reaffirming some extent of conservation in plant promoter architecture and CRE distribution.14,16,17 Several exceptions exist where well-characterized plant CREs, such as CArG box (CC[A/T]6GG) and A-box (TACGTA) recognized by MADS TFs7 and bZIP44 TFs, respectively (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1), do not possess authentic CRE properties. This observation does not discount these CREs’ involvement in the regulation of plant biological functions, showing the need for additional scanning approaches or other statistical models12 in order to capture the full spectrum of functional CREs in grapevine.3.2. Enriched biological pathways support the relevance of CREs in grapevine promotersTo ascertain the biological roles of genes whose promoters contain these CREs, functional enrichment analysis has been widely adopted.14,16 In this study, the MapMan ontology,39 tailored specifically for plants, was adopted for the identification of enriched biological pathways due to its improve gene function prediction performance compared with gene ontology.49 The evaluation of all compiled CREs was performed and summarized in Supplementary Table S2. Emphasis is given to those which scored highly across the CF, Z-score, or FE (Fig. 2).Enriched functional categories of genes containing selected 6-mer and 8-mer CREs in their promoter sequences. The opacity of the dot corresponds to –log10 FDR functional category enrichment values. The size of the dots corresponds to the number of genes (log10 scaled) whose promoters contain the selected CRE. Commonly associated names for CREs are indicated in brackets.Enriched functional categories of genes containing selected 6-mer and 8-mer CREs in their promoter sequences.

The size of the dots corresponds to the number of genes (log10 scaled) whose promoters contain the selected CRE. Commonly associated names for CREs are indicated in brackets.The AuxRE, TGTCTC, was enriched (FDR < 0.05) in protein targeting, regulation of transcription, and secondary metabolism with 64,724, and 251 genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Conversely, TGTCGG-containing promoters are highly enriched in hormone metabolism (168 genes, FDR < 5.5E-04) pathways, specifically auxin (49 genes) and ethylene (38 genes) biosynthesis and regulation. Cell wall metabolism (105 genes) and post-translational modification (160 genes) pathways were also significantly enriched. Enrichment of hormone homeostasis and post-translational modification pathways is not surprising as these mechanisms regulate plant ARF function and ARFs are known to facilitate feedback loops within the auxin signalling pathway.8 Although both TGTCTC’s and TGTCGG’s functional enrichment profiles suggest that various pathways are potentially targeted by ARFs in grapevine, TGTCGG-containing promoters show higher enrichment profiles coinciding with a higher affinity presence of ARFs.5,11 Nonetheless, treatment of the auxin analogue (naphtalenacetic acid) in grape berries at the onset of ripening and harvest significantly modulated > 1,000 genes at each stage, many of which were auxin- and ethylene-related pathway genes,50 consistent with the enrichment profiles of TGTCGG-containing genes reported here. As no grapevine ARFs have been functionally characterized, the specificity of each member (19 in total8) in delineating real targets from the vast number of AuxRE-containing promoters, and the exact mode of their regulation (activation/repression), remains to be determined.The CACGTG (G-box) containing promoters were enriched (FDR < 0.05) in a plethora of pathways including regulation of transcription (552 genes), abiotic and biotic stress (230 genes), development (185 genes), flavonoid metabolism (85 genes), sugar metabolism (43 genes), and many more (Supplementary Table S2). This observation is consistent with the role of plant bZIP44 and bHLH46 TFs; especially a subset of those who regulate a large repertoire of plant development processes and stress responses (e.g. bZIP-HY551,52 and bHLH-PIFs45). In grapevine, recent studies demonstrate that bZIP/bHLH TFs have a role in regulating fruit ripening (VviABF253) and the flavonoid pathway (VvibZIPC22,28,VviHY5,29 and VviMYC154). The high enrichment of CACGTG-containing genes (122 genes, FDR < 2.1E-05) in biotic stress pathways is of interest as limited information is known on the roles of bZIP and bHLH TFs in plant immunity regulatory networks.55Promoters of genes containing AGATATTT, a circadian clock associated CRE, were highly enriched in secondary metabolism (197 genes, FDR < 4.6E-06; especially flavonoids and isoprenoids), hormone metabolism (159 genes, FDR < 1.1E-04), and abiotic stress (102 genes, FDR < 1.5E-03) pathways. The ubiquity of the circadian clock in regulating many aspects of secondary metabolism (e.g. flavonoid and isoprenoid), hormone biosynthesis and signaling (e.g. jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), auxin, and ABA), and abiotic stress (e.g. cold, drought, and nutrient availability) is well documented.56,57 Interestingly, many chalcone (10 genes), stilbene (20 genes),58 and terpene (35 genes)59 synthases that contain the AGATATTT CRE within their promoters, exist in grapevines as highly duplicated gene families compared with other plants.24 Many of these stilbene and terpene synthases may belong to a novel ‘expanded’ clock regulatory network in grapes, especially for stilbene synthases which are exclusively found in stilbene-producing plants, such as grapevines.58 These insights reveal both potential and novel regulatory repertoires of grapevine circadian clock homologues, VviLHY and VviRVE1.60Collectively, these examples and many others (Supplementary Table S2) characterize potential targets of grapevine TFs and provide insight into the collective roles of genes containing certain CREs. Nonetheless, we further explored the possibility of obtaining more information on the grapevine CRE cis-regulatory code by integrating large-scale gene expression meta-analysis and GCN. Compared with approaches that solely rely on the distribution of CREs alone, integrated approaches provides a deeper understanding of the contribution of CREs in determining global gene expression responses12 and the coordinated regulation among genes in a GCN based on their network connectivity and promoter CRE structure.133.3. Numerous CREs are implicated in grapevine stress-responsive and development-dynamic transcriptionTo determine the contribution of CREs in determining stress-responsive and development-dynamic gene transcription, meta-analysis of publicly available next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and the grapevine tissue developmental atlas was first performed (Supplementary Fig. S1). The survey for stress-related RNA-seq datasets yielded a total of 87 conditions (260 non-averaged) from 10 experiments that considered various abiotic (e.g. drought and shading) and biotic stress (e.g. Botrytis cinerea, Erysiphenecator, and Plasmoparaviticola) (Supplementary Table S3). All these conditions also correspond to three different organs: leaf, berry, and flower. Given the incompleteness of sequenced mRNA across tissues and associated developmental stages, the grapevine expression atlas was considered.25 Based on the NimbleGen microarray platform capable of profiling > 95% of the predicted grapevine transcriptome. The grapevine atlas represents the most comprehensive (54 tissues) compendia of tissue x developmental gene expression series to date.In the stress-related compendia, 17,623 genes (59% of transcriptome) were collectively modulated (|log2FC|>1, FDR < 0.05) across all the comparisons (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Abiotic stress treatments (drought and shading) modulated more than 5,000 genes in leaves and flowers, while biotic stress treatments (B. cinerea, E. necator, P. viticola, and Tetranychusurticae) modulated more than 4,000 genes collectively in berries and leaves. Previous work by Fasoli et al.25 revealed the grapevine atlas transcriptome relationships to be highly clustered according to their developmental indices, but did not identify the genes that are developmentally modulated in each tissue/organ. Meanwhile, reanalysis of grapevine atlas was performed to identify genes that are modulated during development and maturity progression. As expected, more than 85% (25,947 genes) of the predicted transcriptome is significantly modulated (|log2FC|>1, FDR < 0.05) across the whole atlas (excluding carpel, stamen, petal, pollen, seedling, and root). In organs such as berry (flesh, pericarp, and seed), tendril, stem, and buds more than 10,000 genes were modulated as development progresses while berry skin, rachis, leaf, and inflorescence had lesser modulated genes.Several studies have shown that filtering for highly modulated genes, often within top 100 most modulated genes15 or having large (> 6-fold) fold changes,12 may be better suited for identifying major CREs driving expression under a particular condition. We empirically determined that the top 300 most up- and down-regulated genes would provide a reasonable threshold closely satisfying the large fold change requirements (Fig. 3A;Supplementary Fig. S2). These genes typically have a median fold change greater than 4- and 8-fold in the stress and development datasets, respectively. In addition, 10,847 and 8,224 unique genes were within top 300 up- and down-regulated genes in at least one stress and developmental condition, respectively, with an overlap of 5,601 genes that were within the 300 up- and down-regulated genes in both stress-responsive and developmental-dynamic condition.Summary of differential expression analysis and distribution patterns of CRE presence under stress and development conditions.

(B) Boxplots depict the proportions of the genes (containing the respective CRE) that were highly responsive to either stress-responsive and/or development-dynamic (orange) or were non-responsive to the tested conditions (purple), for all 6-mer and 8-mer CRE. (C) Boxplots depict the proportions of the genes (containing the respective CRE) that were highly responsive to only stress-responsive (red), development-dynamic (blue), and both stress-responsive and development-dynamic (green).For each 6-mer CRE, the proportion of the genes (containing the respective CRE) that were highly responsive to either stress-responsive and/or development-dynamic was analysed in detail. Considering all 6-mer CREs, their proportions had a median distribution of 46% (Fig. 3B); more specifically, a median distribution of 37% was considered only stress-responsive, 28% was only development-dynamic, while 19% was considered both stress-responsive and development-dynamic (Fig. 3C). Similar proportions were also observed for 8-mer CREs (Fig. 3B and C), albeit some outlier CREs show that genes containing the latter CREs were neither highly stress-responsive nor development-dynamic. Therefore, this suggests that the distribution of 6-mer to 8-mer CREs in gene promoters likely contributes to approximately half of the DE across the various abiotic, biotic stresses, and development comparisons evaluated. These analyses provided a basis for selecting genes for the construction of condition-specific GCNs in order to discover condition-specific 6–8-mer CRE-driven regulatory modules.3.4. CRE-driven modules are biologically relevant in condition-specific GCNsTwo GCNs (one stress- and one development-specific) were constructed with gene expression matrices using the MR approach. Co-expression studies in many plants23 and in grapevine28–30,61 have shown that direct correlations (e.g. PCC) and rank-based co-expression (e.g. MR) can be used to infer co-expression relationships, albeit rank-based co-expression is generally more robust and is the most popular approach among crop GCNs.23 In addition, establishment of statistically significant reciprocal ranks, MR in this case, may further improve the robustness of the resulting GCN by retaining strong and significant co-expression.21 In the two datasets, we empirically chose a MR cut-off of 35 based on 1,000 permutations of each expression matrices, which corresponds to a statistical confidence of P < 0.003 and 0.005 for the surviving MR in the stress- and development-specific GCN, respectively. These network criteria are highly comparable to the parameters applied in other studies that define strong and significant co-expression. For example, GCNs constructed with MR < 50,19 statistical significance of reciprocal ranks with P < 0.01,21 or by retaining top 100 strongest connections.20 The final stress-specific GCN results in 10,800 nodes and 134,100 edges, while the final development-specific GCN consists of 8,224 nodes, 113,790 edges (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). The number of connections for each node in the stress-specific GCN network ranges between 1 and 84, with a median of 21 connections, while the development-specific GCN ranged between 2 and 93, with a median of 24 connections.Next, we adopted a recently proposed ‘bottom-up’ approach by Ma and co-workers13 to identify gene expression modules potentially driven by CREs of co-expressed genes. Using this approach, 245 and 289 CRE-driven modules (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8) in stress- and development-specific GCNs, respectively, were enriched (FDR < 0.05) with at least one MapMan BIN category (Supplementary Table S2). Although modular structures self-manifested in most CRE-driven modules,13 we applied community clustering to ensure robust final submodules.38 In total, 880 and 1,095 CRE-driven submodules were enriched (FDR < 0.05) in the stress and development-specific GCNs, respectively, with at least one MapMan BIN category (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, these enriched submodules corresponded to more ‘global’ CRE-driven modules, 293 and 314 for stress and development, respectively, demonstrating that CRE-driven submodules have higher predictive performance compared with interpreting ‘global’ CRE-driven modules as a whole. The biological relevance for some of these condition-specific CRE-driven submodules will be discussed in greater detail.3.5. CACGTG enriched co-expression network is involved in ABA metabolism and light-related functionsThe G-box (CACGTG) was found to be highly enriched for stress-responsive genes having scored a CF, Z-score, and FE of 2.7, 3.7, and 4.5, respectively. To investigate whether the enrichment observed has a biological relevance, a gene network was constructed for the stress dataset. A total of 842 genes composed a network comprising a total of 20 community clusters. Some of these clusters were significantly enriched with different MapMan BIN categories (Table 1). Focus is given to the core modules with bZIP and bHLH TFs since previous research has shown that the G-box CRE has been associated with the binding of these TFs.44,46 The presence of these TFs within the modules of the CACGTG network would suggest that the TFs contribute to the regulation of genes and processes pertaining to the selected module. MapMan enrichment of selected G-box and GCC-core submodules in the stress datasetx, overlap size; n, query size; and k, term size represent the contingency tables for MapMan enrichment calculations.MapMan enrichment of selected G-box and GCC-core submodules in the stress datasetx, overlap size; n, query size; and k, term size represent the contingency tables for MapMan enrichment calculations.Module I (Fig. 4A and B) had a MapMan ontology enrichment pertaining to ABA metabolism. In this module six bZIPs and one bHLH were identified, of which one bZIP encodes the grapevine ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR2 (VviABF2, VIT_18s0001g10450) involved in regulating berry ripening in an ABA-dependent manner.53 However, direct implication of VviABF2 in regulating stress response networks remains to be established. In Arabidopsis, previous research has shown that this homologous bZIP is involved in ABA mediated stress responses including drought.62 In the VviABF2 subnetwork (k = 2) of Module I (Fig. 4A), members of the ABA signaling pathway were immediately connected with VviABF2 including a homolog (VviABI1, VIT_11s0016g03180) of an Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2C, ABA insensitive 1, an essential component of the ABA signaling network,63 and two homeodomain-leucine zipper TFs (VviHB7, VIT_15s0048g02870 and VviHB12, VIT_02s0025g02590), involved in the signal transduction pathways mediating growth in response to drought.64 In addition, VviABF2 might be involved indirectly (k = 2) in the regulation of a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2 (VviNCED3, VIT_19s0093g00550), encoding the putative rate-limiting step of ABA biosynthesis, and a protein phosphatase 2C gene (VviPP2C9, VIT_06s0004g05460) involved in ABA signalling.63 To determine the involvement of this subnetwork in grapevine stress responses, meta-analysis of stress-related RNA-seq datasets described above was performed. Water deficit resulted in higher gene expression and greater up-regulation of module genes especially in leaves compared with berries (Fig. 4C). This observation is in agreement with the role of ABA metabolism and signaling in response to drought,63 while highlighting differences in ABA metabolism and signaling pathways that arise between organs.65,66A stress-specific G-box (CACGTG) submodule and the expression profile of submodule genes in different stress conditions and tissues.

Our recent work proposed that VviHYH may fulfil both co-operative and partially redundant roles with VviHY5 during both grapevine photomorphogenic growth, berry development, and under stress.29,67 Supporting this, many genes involved in light- and chloroplast-related functions were densely connected the VviHYH subnetwork (k = 2) of Module I (Fig. 4B). This includes electron transport pathway genes (e.g. NDHT, VIT_18s0117g00260 and PGR5, VIT_05s0049g01760), chlorophyll breakdown (e.g. ACD1/PAO, VIT_06s0004g00610), chloroplast-targeting (TIC55, VIT_04s0008g07020 and ANKYRIN REPEAT PROTEIN, VIT_04s0008g03840), DNA-damage repair (e.g. PHOTOLYASE 1/PHR1/UVR2, VIT_02s0241g00040 and CRY3, VIT_04s0008g02670), and light signaling (SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA 3/SPA3, VIT_12s0028g03570). In addition, genes involved in the glycosylation of flavonols—essential for enhancing their solubility in water and accumulation in plant cells68—namely VviGT5 (VIT_11s0052g01630) and VviGT6 (VIT_11s0052g01600), were connected with VviHYH within one and two steps, respectively. An Arabidopsis MYB-like domain TF homolog (VviMYBD, VIT_01s0026g01050), involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis,69 was also co-regulated with VviHYH (k = 2). These observations reaffirm the involvement of VviHYH submodule genes in light-regulated transcriptional and secondary metabolism networks in a stress-related context. The strong presence of the G-box CRE may imply a co-operative role of other bZIP TFs in its regulation, such as HY5.51 This has been shown for VviGT5, which is up-regulated in a grape HY5 transient expression assay,29 although VviHYH might also be involved in VviGT5 regulation. Expression of module genes was largely down-regulated during the early stages (12–24 hours post-inoculation, hpi) of leaves infected with P. viticola and E. necator, spider-mites, as well as berries infected with B. cinerea at the late stages of berry development (Fig. 4C). This strong and rapid negative response to pathogen and pest attack supports the growing evidence of the involvement of light-regulated transcriptional networks, such as the VviHYH subnetwork, in plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions.523.6. GCC-box network highlights pathogen response and signalling in stress datasetAlthough individual CRE modules may reveal important biological insights, many CRE modules often overlap13 as underlying genes are shared between similar as well as distinct CRE modules. In the case of similar CREs, the canonical GCC-box sequence (GCCGCC), a well-known binding site for DREB and ERF subfamilies of AP2/ERFs TFs, mediates ethylene and jasmonate signaling in response to pathogens.43,55 Recent studies now show that GCC-related elements (GCCGTC and GCCGGC) are also CREs targeted by DREB and ERF TFs.5 In this study, GCC-box, and GCC-related CREs (GCCGTC and GCCGGC) were found to be enriched. GCNs were built for these CREs. Each of three CREs’ GCNs contained at least one module with an AP2/ERF TF: Modules I and VI for GCCGCC, Module II for GCCGTC, and Modules I, III, and IV for GCCGGC (Supplementary Table S7). Comparing those modules, the expression profiles of their genes were highly similar (Supplementary Fig. S3) and were enriched with genes pertaining to ethylene and jasmonate signaling. Furthermore, when comparing the genes involved in their networks, GCCGCC contained 82.9% unique genes, GCCGTC had 42.2% unique genes, and GCCGGC had 37.8% unique genes (Fig. 5A). Taking note of the similarity between these networks, a GCC core network (Fig. 5B) comprised of 428 genes was formed by merging the three mentioned networks. From the modules generated, two of them, Module I (Fig. 5C) and II (Fig. 5D) contained various combination of AP2/ERF CREs.Combined stress-specific GCC-box and related submodules and the expression profile of submodule genes in different stress conditions.

(E) Heat map showing significant and strong differential expression (up-regulation, red/light gray; down-regulation, blue/dark gray) of submodule genes in several stress conditions considering different tissues (see Supplementary Fig. S1A for descriptions).In Module I, five predicted grapevine AP2/ERFs (VviERF106, VIT_15s0021g01630; VviERF107, VIT_16s0013g00890; VviERF127, VIT_07s0005g03220; VviERF132, VIT_14s0081g00730; VviERF1L2, VIT_07s0005g03230) were found (Fig. 5C), all of which are homologous to group IX (B-3) AP2/ERFs in Arabidopsis.70 Members of group IX (B-3) AP2/ERFs are widely implicated in pathogen responses in Arabidopsis.43 In this module, VviERF1L2 is directly co-expressed with several genes containing GCC-related CREs including one class I chitinase (VIT_07s0005g02560) which may fulfil basic defense-related roles in grapevine,71 an Arabidopsis homolog of 12-oxophytodienoate reductase (VviOPR1, VIT_18s0041g02070) involved in the detoxification of harmful oxylipins accumulated during pathogen attack or wounding and potentially JA biosynthesis,72 and a protein kinase gene (VIT_13s0019g01080) closely related to Arabidopsis BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE173 involved in the signaling cascade for defense response against pathogens. Other basic defense-related genes such as a pathogenesis-related protein (VIT_05s0077g01690) containing a GCC-box CRE is connected with VviERF132. Phenylpropanoid pathway genes encoding stilbene synthases (VIT_10s0042g00850 and VIT_10s0042g00860) and a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (VIT_14s0066g01150) involved in the biosynthesis of stilbene and lignin compounds implicated in grapevine biotic stress response,58,74 were directly connected with VviERF106 and VviERF127. One ethylene biosynthesis gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (VIT_12s0059g01380) was directly co-expressed with VviERF107. The gene expression profile of module genes involved in hormone biosynthesis (ethylene and JA), signalling, secondary metabolism, and transcriptional regulation, were induced by B. cinerea infection in berries (24 hpi), leaves upon herbivory attack by spider mite, and leaves with powdery mildew (5 days post-infection) in the susceptible genotype Carignan (Fig. 5E). This observation supports the participation of module genes and multiple GCC-related CREs in grapevine response to pathogens (necrotrophic and biotrophic) and insect herbivory, whereby activation of inducible defense mechanism via ethylene and JA pathways might confer basal defense against these biotic stressors.In Module II, three AP2/ERF genes were present namely VviERF2 (VIT_02s0234g00130), VviERF017 (VIT_11s0016g00660), and VviRRTF1 (VIT_03s0063g00460), of group IX (B-3), II (A-5), and X (B-4), respectively.70 Compared with the previous module, this module had an enrichment pertaining to transcription regulation and signaling with respect to AP2/ERFs and WRKYs (Table 1). Three ERFs were selected as ‘seed’ or ‘guide’ ERFs to create a subnetwork, where VviERF2 is central, connecting all nodes within this subnetwork (Fig. 5D). The homologs of Arabidopsis WRKY33 (VviWRKY33, VIT_06s0004g07500) and WRKY40 (VviWRKY40, VIT_09s0018g00240) were directly connected with VviERF2. In Arabidopsis, WRKY33 modulates many hormonal and metabolic pathway genes, including AtERF2, and confers defense against B.cinerea.75 The presence of the GCC-box CRE in promoters of VviWRKY33 and direct connectivity with VviERF2 highlights a potential conserved regulation with that of Arabidopsis, where VviWRKY33 might be a target of VviERF2 in grapevines. Arabidopsis WRKY40 also contributes to broad resistance against necrotrophs, biotrophs, and hemibiotrophs, through the modulation of JA and SA crosstalk when facing different pathogen lifestyles.76 In addition, a NAC TF gene homologous to Arabidopsis ATAF1 (ATAF1, VIT_07s0031g02610), was directly connected with VviERF2. Arabidopsis ATAF1 is involved in both JA and ABA crosstalk and has dual roles in abiotic and biotic stress.77 Together, the co-expression network surrounding VviERF2, VviERF017, and VviRRTF1, may be implicated in hormonal crosstalk during plant immune response and abiotic stress through cooperative action with WRKY and NAC TFs. Both abiotic and biotic transcriptional networks are known to be mediated by AP2/ERF, WRKY, and NAC TFs regulons in plants.6,78 One pathogen-related secretory pathway gene encoding grapevine PENETRATION1 (VviPEN1, VIT_08s0032g01150) was directly co-expressed with VviERF2 and VviRRTF1. The PEN1-mediated secretory pathway is an important defense strategy against powdery mildew, mediating penetration resistance.79 The gene expression profile of the GCC module II subnetwork is similar to module I, concordant with the role of module genes involved in immunity against necrotrophs as observed in Arabidopsis (Fig. 5E). Striking differences were observed especially in grapevine leaves infected with P. viticola, as many module genes were down-regulated, potentially highlighting antagonism between JA and SA signaling pathway. Down-regulation of JA signaling might alleviate repression of SA signaling, and activate early defense-related pathways during P. viticola interaction.71 In addition, module genes may play a role in the regulation of signaling pathways for flower abscission, as module genes were largely down-regulated by gibberellic acid treated flowers but up-regulated in shaded ones. Therefore, comparison of module I and II of the GCC network may reveal different aspects of transcriptional networks targeted by GCC-box and related sequences, such as the activation of defense mechanisms or the modulation of hormone signaling.3.7. Different cell wall remodelling genes are enriched in subnetworks of the CCWACC development-specific networkDifferences in biological function enrichments were also observed for many CRE submodules constructed from the developmental and stress-specific GCNs. For example, CCWACC commonly referred to as an AC-element, is one of the three main R2R3-MYB binding sites.10 It showed bona fide CRE properties (CF 1.90, Z-score 3.61, and FE 1.86 in stress-responsive, and CF 1.87, Z-score 3.10, and FE 1.87 in development-dynamic genes), and was highly enriched for biological functions in both sets of genes. However, in the developmental dataset greater enrichment for biological pathways, especially cell wall metabolism, was observed compared with stress. Therefore, focus will be given to the development-specific CCWACC network.Two modules in the CCWACC network were enriched with distinct cell wall remodeling gene families (Table 2). The Module I (Fig. 6A) contained genes related to primary cell wall-related functions, while the Module VI (Fig. 6B) contained genes related to secondary cell wall metabolism. One MYB gene in module I (VviMYB91A, VIT_08s0007g00410) encodes an orthologue of Arabidopsis MYB91/ASYMETRIC LEAVES 1.80 In Arabidopsis, MYB91/ASYMETRIC LEAVES 1 regulates the development of several vegetative and reproductive organs including leaves and flowers.80 Additionally, a SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN 8 gene (VviSPL8, VIT_15s0021g02300), shown to regulate the floral and seed development in Arabidopsis,81 was directly connected to VviMYB91A. Many cell wall remodelling genes involved in degradation and modification containing CCWACC CREs in their promoter were also present, indirectly and directly connected to VviMYB91A and VviSPL8, respectively. Examples include one gene encoding expansin B (VviEXPB2, VIT_12s0059g00190), pectin methylesterase (VviPME3, VIT_03s0017g01950), two predicted polygalacturonases (VviPG, VIT_05s0020g00420 and VIT_15s0046g02000), and orthologues of Arabidopsis Beta-d-xylosidase 4 (VviXYL4, VIT_12s0055g01180 and VIT_12s0121g00230). Module genes were highly expressed during the early growth stages and decreased during development of various vegetative (e.g. rachis, tendril, leaf, stem, and seedling) and in reproductive (e.g. inflorescence, flowering, berry skin, and seed) organs (Fig. 6D). This observation reveals a strong coordinated regulation of module genes and TFs (e.g. VviMYB91A and VviSPL8) which might be critical for precise growth control during early stages of development.Development-specific submodules extracted from AC-element (CCWACC) and AGATTCT CRE modules, and the expression profile of submodule genes in different tissues and developmental stages.

These include a fasciclin arabinogalactan-protein (VviFLA11, VIT_06s0004g03050), a glucuronyltransferase (VviGUX2, VIT_18s0001g10580), a galacturonosyltransferase (VviGAUT12, VIT_19s0014g05130), a COBRA protein (VviCOBL4, VIT_14s0083g01150), one cellulose synthase (VviCESA8, VIT_10s0003g01560), and two laccase (VviLAC17, VIT_13s0019g01920, VIT_13s0019g02160) genes. Interestingly, one NAC TF (VviNST1, VIT_02s0025g02710), homolog to Arabidopsis NST1, was directly connected with VviMYB185. In Arabidopsis, both NST1 and MYB83 are master switches for secondary cell wall development, albeit NST1 function as the primary master switch while MYB83 is downstream in the hierarchy.83 Meanwhile, an additional battery of secondary cell wall-related genes indirectly connected with VviMYB185 encoding a cellulose synthase (VviCESA7, VIT_11s0037g00530), a laccase (VviLAC4, VIT_06s0004g06090), a galacturonosyltransferase-like protein (VviGATL1, VIT_04s0023g01120), a beta-xylosidase (VviBXL1, VIT_05s0077g01280), and two xylan synthases (VviIRX9, VIT_08s0040g02340) contain CCWACC CRE in their promoters. The latter genes may also be potential regulatory targets of VviMYB185 or of other R2R3-MYBs. Supporting this idea, many secondary cell wall genes in Arabidopsis that are present in the VviMYB185 network are known to be regulated by R2R3-MYB TFs (including MYB83) through the AC-element and related sequences.83,84 Compared with Module I of the developmental CCWACC network, this module’s activation was mainly present at the early development stages of the seed, rachis, and stem, and in the late stages of the inflorescence and tendrils (Fig. 6D). The difference in cell wall metabolism pathway enrichment is not limited to the CCWACC network, but to other developmental submodules that are potentially regulated by ARF (TGTCGG and TGTCGA),5,11 NAC (TTGCGT and TTCCTT),85 and AP2/ERF (ACCGACA).6,433.8. AGATTCT developmental network module is specifically enriched in photosynthesis-related genesAlthough CREs and CRE-driven subnetworks, such as those previously discussed, show that strong positional bias towards the TSS and FE scores provide reasonable proxies for identifying bona fide CREs and biologically relevant modules, some CREs and CRE-driven subnetworks lack these properties. For example, the 7-mer CRE AGATTCT (CF 2.69, Z-score 0.13, and FE 6.91 in the developmental dataset), whose network contains a G2-like TF. DNA-binding specificities of lesser known plant TF families such as G2-like, a subclass of GARP proteins, have been recently characterized.5 The G2-like TF, GLK, is implicated in photosynthesis and chloroplast development in many plants86 and is a key factor regulating the latitudinal gradient of ripening87 and various quality traits in fruits.88 Arabidopsis GLK1 recognizes the AGATTCT CRE sequence.5 The AGATTCT network in the developmental dataset contained 113 genes and was highly enriched for many photosynthesis-related genes, especially in modules I and II (Table 2) suggesting that GLK-regulated gene networks are highly conserved across plants including grapevine. Present in module I (Fig. 6C) are VviGLK1, the homolog of Arabidopsis GLK1 (VviGLK1, VIT_12s0028g03100), and its likely target genes which encode for photosystem I polypeptide subunits (VviPSAN, VIT_04s0044g01410; VviPSAF, VIT_00s0125g00280; VviPSAD-2, VIT_05s0020g03180) and light harvesting complexes (VviCAB1-1, VIT_10s0003g02890; VviCAB1-2, VIT_10s0003g02900; VviLHB6, VIT_12s0055g01110). One gene involved in cellular redox homeostasis (VviCDSP32, VIT_18s0001g00820) was also implicated in this module. The expression survey across the developmental dataset revealed that module I genes are highly expressed in immature organs of the berry pericarp, flesh, skin, and seed, as well as in rachis, buds, and leaves, and gradually decrease their expression as development of each organ progresses (Fig. 6D). Therefore, the consistent down-regulation of module genes may reflect an active role of photosynthetic genes and VviGLK1 in the immature-to-mature phase transition of grapevine organs, similar to the observations in other plants.86 Additionally in grape berries, these module genes may be critical for the establishment of differing ripening gradients during the onset of ripening, as seen with the role of GLK1 in tomatoes.87,883.9. Comparison between grapevine and Arabidopsis motif-driven GCNsCompared with other plants, CRE-driven GCNs have only been elucidated in Arabidopsis; several of which include the G-box, MYB (CCWACC), WRKY (KTTGACY), and the site II element (TGGGCY) CRE modules.13 Based on the conserved G-box and CCWACC CRE, which are also evaluated in this study, many enriched (GO enrichment) biological pathways in Arabidopsis are shared with those identified in this study. For example, highly enriched terms related to photosynthesis, hormone (ethylene and ABA) metabolism, and stress responses were common in G-box CRE modules between grapevine (Supplementary Table S3) and Arabidopsis.13 Similarly, secondary metabolic pathways, especially related to flavonoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism, cell wall, and stress responses, were common for the CCWACC (MYB) CRE module. To determine if other grapevine CRE modules harbor unique and/or common features at a larger scale, we expanded the search in Arabidopsis by constructing CRE modules (P < 0.01) using the Arabidopsis graphical Gaussian model gene network with a partial correlation threshold > 0.05 (Ma et al.13) (Supplementary Table S9). We then determined their biological pathway (Mapman) enrichment profiles (Supplementary Table S10) and performed the comparison with CRE modules from grapevine. In addition to the G-box and CCWACC CRE, some grapevine CRE modules share a high degree of similar gene enrichments with Arabidopsis CRE modules which includes ACGTGKC (ABRE), TGTCGG, TTTCCCGC, and YAACKG (MYB) (Supplementary Table S10), suggesting similar properties of gene expression and gene networks between grapevine and Arabidopsis. However, others share a small proportion of enriched pathways and/or have entirely unique enriched terms such as GCCGCC, RCCGAC, TGACGTG (bZIP), TTGACC (W-box), TGTCGA, TGTCTC, TTGCGT (NAC), and TTCCTT (NAC) (Supplementary Table S10). For example, enriched terms in the Arabidopsis GCC-box CRE modules include biotic stress and ATP synthesis. In comparison, the grapevine stress-dependent GCC-box CRE modules share enrichment for ATP synthesis but have unique enriched terms related to hormone signaling—jasmonate and ethylene, TF regulation, and flavonoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Similarly, CRE modules such as DRE (A/GCCGAC) conserved between Arabidopsis and grapevine share enrichment profiles for galactinol/raffinose metabolism but differ in specific cell wall metabolic processes, hormone metabolism, and stress responses. Unique enrichment profiles for the grapevine DRE module include lipid metabolism and photosynthesis. These differences might indicate potential diversification of utilized CREs between grapevine and Arabidopsis that maintain the enriched CRE modules but with differing biological functions. Nonetheless, parameters used to construct the respective CRE modules which include different underlying experimental conditions, correlation metrics, and CRE P-value threshold may also introduce differences.Comparative expression analysis of grapevine genes (assigned to CRE modules) with corresponding Arabidopsis orthologues may also reveal potential similarities and differences in expression dynamics between species. Genes of selected CRE modules such as G-box and GCC-core modules were further evaluated considering the responses of their putative Arabidopsis orthologues under similar and additional treatments (Supplementary Table S11). For example, 123 (of the 189) genes in the grapevine stress-specific G-box module I have predicted Arabidopsis orthologues. Arabidopsis orthologues for these genes are largely induced in various abiotic stress conditions especially cold, osmotic stress, and salt, but also to UV-B, drought, and heat stress albeit at a lesser extent (Supplementary Table S11A). Biotic stress pathways are also highly modulated in the G-box module I of Arabidopsis and a greater proportion of orthologues are down-regulated against different biotic stress including B. cinerea and powdery mildew, as seen in grapevine (Supplementary Table S11B). In addition, in module I (Supplementary Table S11C) and II (Supplementary Table S11D) of the stress-specific GCC-core module, there are 47 (of 102) and 66 (of 94) grapevine genes which have Arabidopsis orthologues, respectively. Like grapevine, Arabidopsis orthologues for these genes were highly induced upon a wide variety elicitors and plant–pathogen treatments. Although similar gene expression responses were observed for B. cinerea and powdery mildew infection for grapevine and Arabidopsis, an opposite response (induction) was observed for Arabidopsis infection with H. arabidopsidis, the causal agent of downy mildew (Supplementary Table S11C and D), compared with grapevine (Fig. 5E). This highlights potential differences in the transcriptional networks of plant immunity employed by the two species that may involve differing CRE regulation. Nonetheless, the strong and consistent modulation of gene orthologues of CRE modules between grapevine and Arabidopsis suggest a general conservation in promoter architecture, gene expression dynamics, and gene regulatory networks.4. ConclusionIn this study, we have elucidated the properties of a large selection of known plant CREs in grapevine promoters at the genome-scale. We observed that many CREs fulfill the widely-adopted criterions defining authentic plant CREs. We corroborated these findings through extensive biological pathway enrichment analysis suggesting the characterized CRE structure has strong biological relevance. Together, these assessments have elucidated many potential targets of a large repertoire of grapevine TFs for the first time. Large-scale transcriptome analysis using the developmental atlas dataset and a selection of stress-related RNA-seq datasets demonstrated that the distribution of CREs in gene promoters explains close to half of the DE across the various abiotic and biotic stresses, and developmental comparisons evaluated. However, several exceptions exist where well-characterized plant CREs does not possess authentic CRE properties and/or strong enrichment, highlighting the potential diversification of CREs in grapevine promoters and divergence of transcriptional regulatory pathways. Therefore, additional scanning approaches or other statistical models, such as scans using position weight matrices or all possible k-mer nucleotide combinations, might be necessary to capture the full spectrum of grapevine CREs and their biological functions. Nonetheless, by integrating condition-specific GCN, CRE enrichment, and gene expression profiles, numerous condition-specific CRE-driven modules (and submodules) were discovered, providing additional information on the coordinated regulation of submodule genes. Although some of these genes may not contain the given CRE, they are implicated in similar functions, specificity of stress responses, and/or gene expression pattern in tissues/organs within and between CRE-driven submodules. This integrated approach uncovered biologically meaningful submodules in a more robust fashion than just utilizing the distribution of CREs alone. This is exemplified by the modules that corroborated known roles in drought response, pathogen defense, cell wall metabolism, and fruit ripening in grapevine and in other plant species. Some modules reveal novel regulatory functions, although further functional validation will be necessary to confirm the transcriptional control exerted by the large TF repertoire in grapevines. Application of these approaches is not just limited to grapevines but to other sequenced plant genomes, especially crop species,89–91 permitting a greater understanding of the evolution and conservation of plant CREs and transcriptional regulatory pathways.We thank the grapevine research community for making various RNA-seq and microarray datasets publicly available.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was funded by the University of British Columbia (10R18459), Genome British Columbia (10R21188), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (10R23082).Supplementary data"

Heterogeneity in base composition and codon preference has long been the subject of investigation of topics ranging from phylogenetic distortion to the design of overexpression cassettes for transgenic expression. From the overexpression point of view, it is critical to systematically analyze the codon usage patterns of the organelle genomes. In light of the importance of codon usage patterns in the development of hyper-expression organelle transgenics, we present ChloroMitoCU, the first-ever curated, web-based reference catalog of the codon usage patterns in organelle genomes. ChloroMitoCU contains the pre-compiled codon usage patterns of 328 chloroplast genomes (29,960 CDS) and 3,502 mitochondrial genomes (49,066 CDS), enabling genome-wide exploration and comparative analysis of codon usage patterns across species. ChloroMitoCU allows the phylogenetic comparison of codon usage patterns across organelle genomes, the prediction of codon usage patterns based on user-submitted transcripts or assembled organelle genes, and comparative analysis with the pre-compiled patterns across species of interest. ChloroMitoCU can increase our understanding of the biased patterns of codon usage in organelle genomes across multiple clades. ChloroMitoCU can be accessed at: http://chloromitocu.cgu.edu.tw/1. IntroductionOrganelle genomes have been the focus of much research for several decades because of their biological activity linked to photosynthetic efficiency, energy storage, and the regulation of gene expression.1 They have evolved independently, and their genetic architecture has been shaped as a consequence of evolutionary forces.2 One such evolutionary force is codon usage, which has evolved independently in organelle genomes. Codon usage, a pattern that describes the degeneracy of the genetic code and illustrates differential usage of synonymous codons, is thought to be under the influence of several factors such as mutational pressure,3 translational selection,4 and tRNA dependencies.5,6 In model organisms, the evolutionary forces shaping codon usage have been assessed using either genome-wide sets of predicted coding regions or subsets of highly expressed ribosomal proteins.7 In non-model organisms for which complete genome sequences are not available, codon usage has often been estimated using expressed sequence tags4,8,9 or organelle genomes,3 providing clues about the mechanistic evolution of the nuclear and organelle genomes, respectively. From an evolutionary point of view, codon usage plays an important role in defining phylogenies and within-taxon or among-taxa variance.10 Previous studies demonstrated the clade-specific molecular selection and codon adaptation of rbcL, which encodes the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, or RuBisCO.11 Furthermore, chloroplast genomes replicate through a D-loop mechanism and transcribe genes in both the sense and antisense orientation, like the nuclear genome. Codon usage patterns and strand asymmetry have been linked to transcription selection. The highly expressed genes tend to be localized on the leading strand, thus creating a coding bias, which orients the directionality of replication and transcription.12Recently, there has been considerable focus on the exploitation of organelles as a source of pharmaceuticals and as biofactories,13 in which foreign genes are reverse engineered and overexpressed.14 This paves the way for hyper-expression-based genetic engineering using either a single gene, such as Toc cyclase or <U+03B3>-Toc methyltransferase in lettuce,15 or an entire pathway, such as the mevalonate pathway in tobacco.14,16 For efficient transgenic overexpression in chloroplasts, well-established protocols have been widely demonstrated17 based on the alternations of codon usage patterns between organelle genomes, which have predominantly A-ending and/or U-ending codons, and nuclear genomes, which have predominantly G-ending, C-ending, or U-ending codons.18 Despite the relevance of codon usage patterns in phylogenomics and the design of optimal gene-expression experiments, relatively few open-source repositories have been developed for the wide exploration of synonymous codon usage across organelle genomes. Only a few of the repositories in existence encompass even a modest range of taxa; most are either organism-centric, with compiled codon usage tables for microbial organisms,19 or simple, single-organism, web-based displays of codon usage statistics (available at: http://www.cmbl.uga.edu/software/codon_usage.html).In the case of eukaryotes, the majority of the resources available to date are focused on either a single model organism, such as http://crumb.stanford.edu/community/codon_usage.shtml for Saccharomycescerevisiae, which limits the exploration of codon usage patterns across multiple species. It is worthwhile to mention that the Kazusa Codon Usage Database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon) is the only repository that hosts the pre-compiled codon usage counts for a relatively large number of species, including the organelle genomes.20 The latest update of the Kasuza database dates back to 2007 (NCBI-GenBank Flat File Release), which presents a challenge for the exploration and cross-species comparison of codon patterns. The Kasuza database also lacks features such as the cross-comparison of organelle genomes and the comparison of codon usage patterns between user-submitted genes and the pre-compiled organelle genomes. Additionally, the Kasuza database contains a relatively small number of organelle genomes, limiting its ability to explore the recently published organelle genomes and the applicability of those genomes as transgenic vehicles. In a web report on the NCBI Genbank release, Richmond stated that one of the top priorities in codon-usage research was a necessary update of the pre-compiled codon tables, urging that such tables include data from non-model species.21 In light of the limited resources available for the study of organelle genome-specific patterns of codon usage and the critical importance of those patterns to applications to enhance organelle-based bio-factories, multi-gene targeting, and recombinant protein expression22, we developed ChloroMitoCU, which provides simple access to patterns of codon usage in 328 chloroplast genomes (29,960 CDS) and 3,502 mitochondrial genomes (49,066 CDS). ChloroMitoCU allows the comparison of organelle-specific codon patterns across multiple species with the same translational table and also allows comparative assessments of the codon usage patterns between user-submitted transcripts or genes and the pre-compiled organelle genomes.2. Material and methods2.1 Genome data retrieval and codon usage patternsWe retrieved all of the chloroplast (328) and mitochondrial (3,502) genomes from the NCBI organelle genomes repository.23 The coding regions of the respective genomes were downloaded and subsequently parsed for a length threshold. For the identification of the codon usage patterns, we maintained a threshold of 300 bp. We used CodonW (available from codonw.sourceforge.net) to identify the codon usage patterns in each of the genes with a minimum length of 300 bp. To identify the strand-specific codon usage patterns, genes localized on the positive (+) and negative (-) strands were separated based on the organelle genome annotation available in NCBI RefSeq. The current version of ChloroMitoCU contains 29,960 complete (full-length) protein-coding genes (CDSs) from chloroplasts and 49,066 CDSs from mitochondria. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) index was calculated as previously described.3 RSCU values represent the ratio between the observed usage frequency of a codon in a sample and the expected usage frequency if all of the codons in the synonymous codon family for the particular amino acid are used equally.3 To predict potential CDSs in assembled transcripts or organelle genomes, we deployed a modified version of the Transdecoder prediction pipeline (available from https://transdecoder.github.io), which incorporates all of the available translational tables for wider predictions of CDSs across many organisms.3. Results and discussion3.1 Development and applications of ChloroMitoCUFor efficient access, ChloroMitoCU was developed and is hosted on a 64-bit Linux server pre-installed with Python version 2.7.3, Apache (http://www.apache.org), and PHP (http://www.php.net/). ChloroMitoCU runs all analyses in real time via Python modules (version 2.7.10), and the parsed results integrate with PHP modules to provide a web-based display. For each organelle genome, the codon information is further sorted into hierarchal levels of information such as the genomic GC content of the first, second, and third codon positions, the number of encoded proteins, the genome length, the number of tRNAs, and the usage patterns and relative frequencies of codons (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows the user-friendly interface of ChloroMitoCU, which offers a two-way search for browsing chloroplast-specific codon usage patterns (Browse ChloroCU) and mitochondria-specific codon usage patterns (Browse MitoCU). In addition, a dropdown menu provides the alphabetically sorted list of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes with associated translational codes. Lastly, all of the alphabets in the quick-search forms are hyperlinked to the corresponding codon usage-pattern page of the selected species.The efficient browsing system of ChloroMitoCU.The efficient browsing system of ChloroMitoCU.For each organism and organelle, ChloroMitoCU hosts organism-specific and organelle-specific web layouts, which display the species name and corresponding translational table, the amino acid organization, information about synonymous codons from the species-specific translational table (Fig. 1). Organism specific webpages in both Browe ChloroCU and Browse MitoCU displays the species-specific distribution of GC content in the CDSs at the first, second, and third positions, and color-coded codons display of the RSCU values, with stop codons indicated in white and marked by asterisk (*) (Fig. 2). Additionally, it displays the summary of the codon usage statistics with information on the synonymous codons as per the species specific translational table (Fig. 2). Finally, the last module in each organelle-specific or organism-specific web page in Browse ChloroCU and BrowseMitoCU provides real-time comparisons of the codon usage-frequency profiles of the user-selected plastome and any phylogenetically related chloroplast genome (Fig. 3). The inference of RSCU values can help the end-user to investigate the codon usage independently of the amino acid composition. RSCU values > 1 (red horizontal bars), as compared with those < 1 (green horizontal bars), for a codon imply that the codon is used more frequently than expected based on the amino acid content of the gene or genome (Fig. 2).Graphical visualization of the codon counts and real time comparison of the codon counts across several species for comparative assessment across phylogenies.Graphical visualization of the codon counts and real time comparison of the codon counts across several species for comparative assessment across phylogenies.Comparative profiling of the codon usage tables across two organelle genomes.Comparative profiling of the codon usage tables across two organelle genomes.An additional module (Fig. 4) implemented in ChloroMitoCU allows the user to either analyze the CDSs for codon usage patterns or predict the CDSs from stranded or non-stranded assemblies or assembled genes. It further allows the user to select the translational table according to the organelle and also to select between complete CDS predictions or all reported CDSs within the assembled regions. The results page of the prediction module allows the comparative assessment of the codon usage patterns across other pre-embedded organelle genomes using the same codon translational table. The Python module (version 2.7.10) allows the user to simultaneously view the codon usage patterns of the user-input gene of interest and the organelle-specific codon patterns of the selected species in order to understand the codon-specific patterns according to the specific organelle of interest.On-the-fly prediction of CDSs from assembled organelle genome fragments and estimation of the codon counts, taking into account the translational codon table.On-the-fly prediction of CDSs from assembled organelle genome fragments and estimation of the codon counts, taking into account the translational codon table.3.2 Functional genomics and evolutionary applications of ChloroMitoCUFunctional genomics is at the forefront of the accelerated use of plants as models for antibody expression and oral vaccine development.24 Recent reports demonstrate the role of codon optimization in the enhancement of chloroplast gene expression and translation rates.25 Taking that perspective into account, ChloroMitoCU provides comparative analysis of the codon usage patterns of a wide range of chloroplast genomes, which holds great potential for the optimization of gene expression and for heterologous gene expression. Recently, the investigation of a hypothesis coupling codon usage and tRNA import in the unicellular model algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, suggested that co-evolution is the mechanism underlying the dynamic import of tRNAs and that the hypothesis could be adapted to explain the composition of the mitochondrial genome.26 Comparative analyses of base composition revealed a varying level of mutational pressure acting upon chloroplast and nuclear genes18 however, base frequencies at fourfold-degenerate sites in mitochondrial genomes displayed a strong context-dependent mutational pattern, indicating correlations between pairs of neighbouring bases.27 Last, taking into account the relative differences in the strand-specific codon usage patterns in organelle genomes, especially in mitochondrial genomes,27 ChloroMitoCU, provide the strand specific browsing of the codon usage patterns in both organelle genomes (chloroplast and mitochondria) (Fig. 1) to understand the evolutionary role of the strand asymmetry in shaping the codon usage of the user interested organelle and to infer the difference in strand-specific mutational biases.Comparative analyses with nuclear genes revealed the dominance of variable patterns of evolutionary constraints, particularly in chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, which were found to be influenced by the translation level.28 The deciphering of species-specific patterns of codon usage has effectively paved the way for the enhancement of heterologous gene translation in several model and non-model organisms29,30. Comparative assessments of codon usage patterns are important for understanding patterns of codon preferences. For this reason, we implemented an additional module in ChloroMitoCU that allows assessment of two organelle genomes if the genomes share the same codon table. When compared with the previously developed Kazusa database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), ChloroMitoCU provides an easier way to access pre-compiled codon usage tables and has several added functionalities.4. ConclusionChloroMitoCU provides curated information of codon usage patterns in organelle genomes and allows for the comparative assessment of those patterns across organelle genomes. ChloroMitoCU also offers the prediction of CDSs and the comparative assessment of codon usage between the predicted CDSs and the embedded organelle genomes. In the future, ChloroMitoCU will be updated as per the NCBI RefSeq release, and the newly reported chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and their corresponding patterns of codon usage, will be incorporated. The enhancement of expression through the selection of appropriate codon usage patterns has been used to transform several key traits to manage diseases, including viral diseases and to create edible vaccines.29 We believe that ChloroMitoCU will serve as a standard platform to enhance organelle genomics and gene expression and to understand the evolution of the various codon usage patterns in relation to the genomic compositions across the Kingdoms of life.GS thanks Department of Biodiversity and Molecular Ecology, Research and Innovation Centre, Fondazione Edmund Mach, Via E.

Edited by Prof. Kenta NakaiDeciphering the way gene expression regulatory aspects are encoded in viral genomes is a challenging mission with ramifications related to all biomedical disciplines. Here, we aimed to understand how the evolution shapes the bacteriophage lambda genes by performing a high resolution analysis of ribosomal profiling data and gene expression related synonymous/silent information encoded in bacteriophage coding regions.We demonstrated evidence of selection for distinct compositions of synonymous codons in early and late viral genes related to the adaptation of translation efficiency to different bacteriophage developmental stages. Specifically, we showed that evolution of viral coding regions is driven, among others, by selection for codons with higher decoding rates; during the initial/progressive stages of infection the decoding rates in early/late genes were found to be superior to those in late/early genes, respectively. Moreover, we argued that selection for translation efficiency could be partially explained by adaptation to Escherichia coli tRNA pool and the fact that it can change during the bacteriophage life cycle.An analysis of additional aspects related to the expression of viral genes, such as mRNA folding and more complex/longer regulatory signals in the coding regions, is also reported. The reported conclusions are likely to be relevant also to additional viruses.1. IntroductionBecause of a major advantage of being a diverse group of easily manipulated viruses, bacteriophages have various potential uses both in fundamental research and in various biotechnological and biomedical applications. For example, they are used as vehicles for vaccines (both DNA and protein), for the detection of pathogenic bacterial strains, and as a display system for many proteins and antibodies.1–4 Furthermore, phages were also suggested to be used as biocontrol agents in agriculture and petroleum industry, and as alternatives to antibiotics in the case of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. In addition, they often serve as model organisms in molecular evolution studies.1–4 Therefore, understanding the way the viral fitness is encoded in the genetic material of bacteriophages (or other type of viruses) is an important and challenging mission that may potentially contribute to all biomedical disciplines.1–4Deciphering the regulatory information encoded in the genomes of phages or other viruses, and the relation between the nucleotides composition of the coding regions and the viral fitness is a very challenging mission, which was tackled, in the recent years, by various researchers.5–13 Among others, it was suggested that ribosome profiling, which enables the large in vivo genome wide monitoring of ribosome state at a resolution of single nucleotide, is a very useful tool for deciphering the coding complexity of viral (and other organisms) genomes. Specifically, it was shown that ribosome profiling enables detecting novel (possibly very short) coding regions and estimate the translation status of various open reading frames.5–9Here, we focus on the Bacteriophage lambda which is a well-known and studied member of the Siphoviridae family of double-stranded DNA viruses in the Caudovirales order (also known as ‘tailed bacteriophages’ due to their characteristic form). During its lifecycle this phage either resides within the genome of its Escherichia coli host through lysogeny or enters into a lytic phase (which lasts ~25 min) during which it produces progeny viral particles, and kills and lyses the cell (see for example14,15). The genome size of the bacteriophage lambda is ~50 kb nt and includes 66 known genes that were analysed in this study. These genes can be divided into two groups, ‘early’ and ‘late’ according to the stages in the lytic phase when their expression is dominant.9The specific aim of this study is at exploring the way in which translation efficiency related information is encoded on a synonymous level in the coding regions of genes that are expressed during different bacteriophage lambda development stages (i.e. 0–20 min after the beginning of the lytic phase). Some previous studies shed some light on specific elements related to this topic. For example, a recent study by Liu et al.9 employed ribosome profiling to study the progress of bacteriophage lambda gene expression during phage development and showed that the known genes are expressed in a predictable fashion; in addition many previously unknown potential open reading frames were detected. Other studies focused on different aspects of viral translation (and lifecycle in general) regulation that has a significant effect on shaping viral genomes, such as: secondary structures within viral transcripts (mainly in untranslated regions16,17 but also within coding regions18–20) and evolutionary pressure on synonymous codons usage bias.21–25However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to perform a comprehensive, large scale analysis of different types of genomic synonymous information related to regulation of translation efficiency in all coding regions of a bacteriophage lambda, during different stages of its development. In particular, basing on the analysis of ribosome profiling data,9 we demonstrated, for the first time, the condition specific adaptation of the bacteriophage codons in early/late genes to the intra-cellular E. coli environment during the different stages of phage development.2. Material and methods2.1. DataRibosome profiling was applied to the process of lytic growth of Bacteriophage lambda by Liu et al.9 They chose temperature induction of the classic cI857 repressor mutant of Bacteriophage lambda in a lysogen of E. coli MG1655 to synchronize the lytic process, sampling the lysogen and control non-lysogen both before and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after shifting the temperature from 32 °C to 42 °C. Transcript sequences were obtained from EnsEMBL for E. coli (K-12 MG1655 release 121, accessed 28/07/15) and from NCBI for the lambda phage (J02459, accessed 07/12/15). There were 4,319 genes of E. coli and 66 genes of lambda phage in the obtained sequences.Ribosome footprint sequences were obtained from9 (GSE47509, induction 0–20 min). We trimmed the poly-A adaptors from the reads using Cutadapt26 (version 1.8.3), and utilized Bowtie27 (version 1.1.1) to map them to the E. coli-lambda transcriptome. The location of the A-site was approximated by an 11-nt shift from the 5' end of the aligned read. This shift maximized the correlation between MTDR (described below) and the observed read densities per E. coli gene. Further details related to the ribo-seq processing appear in the supplementary methods.2.2. Randomization modelsWe considered two randomization models: (i) To preserve both the amino acids order and content and the frequencies distribution of 16 possible pairs of adjacent nucleotides (dinucleotides), a model based on a multivariate Boltzmann sampling scheme was used.28 This model was initially introduced in the context of enumerative combinatorics and was used by us before for studying other viruses.16,17 We used the original source code which can be found in http://csb.cs.mcgill.ca/sparcs (7 February 2017, date last accessed). (ii) To preserve both the amino acids order and content and the codon usage bias, synonymous positions in codon sequences were randomly permuted.Quantifies the adaptation of the codons of a coding region to the tRNA pool. Technical details regarding this measure appear in the supplementary.We generate histogram of NFC for each codon. Each NFC distribution describes the probability (Pi) (y-axis) of observing each of the codon’s NFC values (x-axis) in the ORFs of the analysed organism.2.3. Codon typical decoding rate (TDR)We used the maximum likelihood criterion to estimate these three parameters for each codon based on E. coli ribosome profiling data by fitting the suggested model to the NFC distribution. 1/µ was defined to be the TDR of each codon.In order to optimize the TDR to E. coli’s read counts in every time condition; we removed outliers from the NFC distribution of each codon in the following way: for every codon (in every time condition), and for each NFCi point related to the codon, we calculated the Pi to see value larger or equal to NFCi based on the pdf fitted to the codon (EMG distribution). Let Ni denote the number of measurements of the codon NFC based on the data; we removed points in which the result of pi*Ni was lower than 0.001.2.4. Synonymous codons usage analysisClustering analysis was performed on RSCF vectors of all coding sequences. In order to exclude biases due to a possible absence of specific amino acids in some of the sequences (missing amino acids), the relative synonymous frequency of a codon corresponding to a missing amino acid was set to the average relative synonymous frequency of this codon over all sequences in which at least one such amino acid is present.The significance of cluster separation was assessed by comparing the DBS of the wildtype sequences to the randomized scores obtained from 100 permutations of gene group labels (early/late).In order to visualize the clustering, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to project the RSCF vectors to a plane spanned by their first two principal components. In order to visualize the separation between clusters a maximum margin separation line—a line for which the distance between it and the nearest point from either of the groups is maximized, was calculated and plotted.In the same manner, analysis of clustering between early and late viral groups and a set of top 50 host genes with the highest protein abundance can be performed.where i is an index of a codon and L is the gene length in codon unit.We computed the MTDR based on the ribosome profiling data of the E. coli (TDRs are effected by translation factors which are common to the host and the bacteriophage). Thus, it should not be sensitive to the low number of bacteriophage reads at the first time points.Quantifies the relative differences in mean MTDR values of early and late gene: RTEC = mean MTDRE -mean MTDRL(mean MTDRE +mean MTDRL) where E and L sigh for early and late genes.Minimum free folding energy (MFE) is a thermodynamic energy involved in maintaining a secondary structure available to perform physical work whilst being released, and thus is characterized by non-positive values. mRNA secondary structure is believed to be in the most stable conformation when minimum amount of free energy is exerted (the MFE obtains the most negative value). The local MFE-profiles were constructed by applying a 39 nt length sliding window to a genomic sequence: in each step the MFE of a local subsequence enclosed by the corresponding window was calculated by Vienna (v. 2.1.9) package RNAfold31 function with default parameters (see, also16,32). This function predicts the MFE and the associated secondary structure for the input RNA sequence using a dynamic programming based on the thermodynamic nearest-neighbor approach (the Zucker algorithm).33First, all the genes in the bacteriophage genome were lined up according to their start codon and MFE-profiles were calculated for each coding region together with 40-nt up-stream the start codon sequence from the 5' UTR. Then, all the genes in the genome were lined up according to their end codon and MFE profiles were calculated for each coding region together with 40-nt down-stream the end codon from the 3' UTR.For each gene 100 randomized MFE-profiles variants were computed basing on randomized sequences generated by the dinucleotide preserving and codon preserving randomization models (both preserving also the encoded proteins, see section above).16,17,28 We did not change the UTRs in the randomization as in this study we are interested in the coding regions.The mean MFE-profile was obtained by averaging the MFE-profiles of all genes (in a position wise manner). In a similar manner, 100 randomized mean MFE-profiles were computed by grouping the randomized MFE-profiles of all genes in 100 groups, each group contains a different variant for each gene, and then averaging the profiles in each group in a position-wise manner.In order to assess the statistical significance of the folding strength at a particular position in a sequence, we compared the mean MFE values at this position with the mean MFE values in the corresponding position in each one of the randomized variants by calculating an empiric P-value—a proportion of the randomized values as extreme as in the wild type. Positions with MFE related P-value <0.05 were defined as selected for strong/weak folding.In addition, we computed mean MFE values for each gene over all windows (by averaging the values in the corresponding MFE-profiles) and compared them to the mean MFE values obtained from the corresponding 100 randomized profiles. For each gene we calculated its mean MFE value and an average of 100 mean MFE values from its randomized variants; the distributions of the wildtype and randomized mean MFE values of different genes were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Early and late genes were analysed separately.This measure is based on the assumption that evolution shapes the organismal coding sequences (and other part of the gene) to improve their interaction with the intra-cellular gene expression machinery. Since these interactions are mediated via binding of the gene expression machinery (e.g. translation/transcription factors, RNAP, ribosomes, RNA binding proteins, etc.) to the genetic material (DNA or RNA), the genetic material tend to have optimized binding sites (which are sub-sequences of nucleotides). We also expect that binding sites will appear in many coding regions and that more optimal binding sites will tend to appear more times in the genome. Thus, if longer substrings of a genome tend to appear in a certain organism’s coding sequence, it suggests that this coding sequence is more optimized to the intra-cellular gene expression machinery and thus it is probably more highly expressed. Here, we computed the ARS index for each bacteriophage gene in comparison to the host (E. coli) and in comparison to the rest of the viral genes.The algorithm of ARS index is based on the following steps: (i) For each position i in the coding sequence S find the longest substring Sij that starts in that position, and also appears in at least one of the coding sequences of the reference genome (E. coli/viral). (ii) Let |S| denote the length of a sequence S; the ARS index of S is the mean length of all the substrings Sij:ARS=<U+2211>sij|s|.Rare codons in a reference set of coding sequences were defined as codons with the relative synonymous frequency <0.2. Three reference sets were used: E. coli coding sequences, bacteriophage early coding sequences, bacteriophage late coding sequences.In order to control the influence of the difference of genes length between early and late groups we sampled the late genes so that the average length of both genes groups is the same. The sampling was of random contiguous blocks of codons from the late genes and according to distributions of early genes.3. Results and discussionThe research outline of the study is described in Fig. 1A. Our analysis was based on the genome (mainly the coding sequences) of the E. coli host (A), the genome of bacteriophage lambda (B) and the ribo-seq measurements of these two (C). To assess the statistical significance of the signals found in the analysed viral genes and to exclude the possibility that these signals are un-direct consequences of other genomic properties, we compared them to signals expected by chance in the corresponding randomized variants (D); two different randomization models were employed: one that maintains the encoded proteins and the frequencies of pairs of adjacent nucleotides (dinucleotides), and the other that maintains the encoded proteins and the frequencies of synonymous codons (codon usage bias). Basing on the ribo-seq data, the expression levels of each gene at each time point (E), the relative decoding rate of each codon (F), and the classification of the bacteriophage genes to early and late (with respect to the beginning of the lytic phase) (G) were derived. On the basis of A, B, D, G, we performed synonymous codons usage analysis of coding regions in viral and E. coli genes (H) using the RSCF (I) and tRNA adaptation indexes (tAI) (J). On the basis of E, F, G, we analysed codons decoding rates for early/late genes at different stages of the viral development (L) on gene/genomic (M) and per-codon (N) levels. In addition, based on A, B, D, G, we studied the local and global signals of evolutionary selection for strong/weak mRNA folding (K) and for higher order synonymous information encoded in repetitive sequence motifs that are longer/more complex than single codons in the coding regions of the bacteriophage genes (O).

(A) A flow diagram and illustration of the study (see details in the main text). (B) Relative expression level of each of the gene groups (early/late) in read count per nucleotide. The major aim of this study is to compare the properties of coding regions of bacteriophage early and late genes; thus, we start with a brief description of the expression pattern of these two gene groups. The analysis of ribo-seq read count per nucleotide for early and late groups of bacteriophage genes appears in Fig. 1B. As can be seen, at the first time point the read count of both groups is very low. Afterwards the expression levels of both gene groups increase; whilst the expression of the early gene group is dominant during minutes 1–10, the expression levels of the late group become dominant towards the 20th minute. Specifically, 32 of the bacteriophage genes are defined as early genes as their expression levels increase from 5 to 10 min, and then decrease by minute 20 after the beginning of the lytic process9; the rest of the genes (34 genes) are define as late genes as their expression levels become significant only at minute 10 from the beginning of the lytic process, and then increase considerably by minute 20 (Fig. 1B and9).3.1. Evidence of selection for different codons in early and late genesAt the first step (Fig. 2A), we aimed at comparing the synonymous codons usage in E. coli and bacteriophage early and late coding sequences. To this end, for each coding sequence, we computed its relative synonymous codon frequencies (RSCF)—a 61-dimensional vector representing each codon (except the stop codons) by its frequency in that sequence normalized relative to the frequencies of other synonymous codons coding for the same amino acid (Methods). Our analysis demonstrated that the early and late genes tend to be clustered into two significantly separated (P-value <0.01) clusters according to their synonymous codons usage. In addition synonymous codon usage in both groups of viral genes was found to be significantly different (P-value <0.01) from that of E. coli (Fig. 2A; Methods). These results provide evidence that different sets of synonymous codons for early vs. late genes are selected in the course of viral evolution and may be related to the optimization of the viral fitness.

Bicteriophage early (blue) late (red) and E. coli (green) genes tend to be clustered into two distinct groups according to their synonymous codons compositions. The separation between the groups was measured by Davies–Bouldin index and found to be significantly higher than expected in random (P < 0.01; see methods). The separation between the groups of early and late viral genes was visualized by a maximum margin separation line—a line for which the distance between it and the nearest point from either of the groups is maximized.

At each time point: average MTDR values of wildtype early/late genes (vertical bars) were compared with MTDR values of 100 corresponding randomized variants (histograms).

We can see that the RTEC of early genes is higher at the beginning and become lower with time (as expected); the first point (t = 0), when there are no measurements of expression, is ignored (see also Fig. 1B).

For early genes, the correlation is higher than for late and E. coli genes and is significant (P-value <0.05) for the firsttime points.

(F) Correlation between TDR and tAI values for each codons at different type points is significant (P value < 0.05).3.2. Differential codon usage in early and late genes can be partially explained by adaptation of translation elongation efficiency to different bacteriophage development stagesHaving shown that early and late viral genes have a significantly different composition of synonymous codons which may be associated with various features of their expression, we would like to focus one such feature, and understand the translation elongation efficiency of bacteriophage coding regions and how it behaves in different stages of the viral lytic cycle.To this aim we employed a condition specific measure of translation elongation30 to study the elongation speed of viral codons/genes during the different steps of phage development. This measure, called MTDR, is based on the estimation of a typical codon decoding rate (TDR) of each codon at each time point30 based on the ribosome profiling data9 and enables ranking codons and coding regions according to their elongation rate whilst controlling for other factors, such as initiation rates and mRNA levels (see details in the Methods section).At the first step, we wanted to check whether the bacteriophage coding regions undergo any selection for optimizing translation elongation. To this end, at every time condition we computed two average MTDR values, for early and late genes separately, and compared them to the average MTDR values obtained for corresponding randomized variants that maintain the wild type amino acid content and the dinucleotide distribution (Methods). As can be seen in Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1, the average MTDR of both groups is significantly higher than expected from the random model in all time points (early: p <0.01; late: p <= 0.04). These results suggest that, indeed, translation elongation efficiency is maintained along the lytic cycle of infection and may be a factor that drives codon evolution in both groups of the bacteriophage genes.At the next step, to compare the translation elongation efficiency between early and late genes, we looked at the RTEC which quantifies the relative differences in average MTDR values of two gene groups: more positive RTEC values mean that early genes are more efficient than the late genes and vice versa, more negative RTEC values mean that late genes are more efficient than the early ones; RTEC values close to zero mean that the two groups of genes have a similar translational efficiency (Methods). Figure 2C describes the RTEC as a function of time (0–20 min). As can be seen, the relative efficiency of elongation of early genes (in comparison to the late genes) is high at the beginning and become lower with time (P-value = 0.04; based on spearman correlation). These results demonstrate that translation elongation efficiency of the early genes is relatively higher at the early stages of the bacteriophage development (when they are expressed) and the translation elongation efficiency of the late genes is relatively higher at the late stages of the bacteriophage development (when they are expressed).Figure 2D describes the per codon correlation between the TDR and RSCF for the two bacteriophage gene groups (early and late) and the E. coli genes at different time points. As can be seen, the correlation is higher and significant for the first time points in the case of the E. coli and early bacteriophage genes. For the late genes, the correlation is significant only at the initial points. The fact that the correlation between RSCF and TDR in the case of the early viral genes is significant at the initial points supports the conjecture that the relative codon decoding times change during the viral development; this is probably related, among others, to the fact that the bacteriophage affects extensively the gene expression in the cell.The lower correlations at time 2 does not seems to be relate to trivial biases/problems with the experiment as the number of reads in the E. coli (used for inferring the MTDR) is similar to the number of read in the different time points; in addition, the number of reads mapped to the viral genes is higher than in time 0. Thus, it is possible that the lower correlation is related to a biological phenomenon: e.g. it is possible that in this time point there is (strong) deviation (which is possibly short in time) of the concentration levels of the translation factors in the cell related to the other points; whilst the codon distributions were shaped to fit the other (longer) periods of the bacteriophage development.3.3. Selection for translation efficiency in bacteriophage genes may be partially explained by adaptation to the E. coli tRNA pool, and the fact that it changes during the bacteriophage developmentPrevious studies demonstrated that that the codon decoding times may be directly influenced by the tRNA levels in the cell (see, for example30).In Fig. 2E, we analysed the adaptation of the viral codons to the genomic tRNA copy number in the host at natural conditions (Methods) and found it to be significant in comparison to the randomized variants that maintain the dinucleotides distribution for both early and late gene groups. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2F, the correlation between the TDR and the tAI of different codons is significant but decreases during the viral development stages. These results may suggest that among others the tRNA levels change during the viral development stages, affecting the codon decoding times.In addition, we analysed the tendency of early/late bacterial coding sequences to use rare synonymous codons with respect to early/late/bacterial gene groups, respectively (RCS). Supplementary Fig. S2 describes the per condition partial correlation (controlling for gene length) between RCS and mean read counts for the two viral gene groups (early and late) and the E. coli genes. As can be seen, the correlation decreases in the case of the early genes and E. coli genes and increases for late genes. Our analysis demonstrates that early/late genes with rare early/late genes codons tend to be lowly expressed at the early/late stages, respectively.The results reported in this section support the conjecture that some of the differences between the early and the late genes are related to the adaptation of viral codons to the intracellular environments in different stages of the phage development. Specifically, we suggest that such adaptation may be result of the fact that the typical decoding times (possibly due to changes in tRNA levels) change during the bacteriophage development.3.4. Additional constraints that shape the codon content of the bacteriophageIn the previous section, we emphasized the importance of the translation elongation efficiency on shaping the codon composition of the Bacteriophage coding regions. In this section, we demonstrate that additional gene expression aspects are also encoded (in parallel) in the coding sequences.First, we examined whether there is a selection for strong/weak local folding in different regions along the genomes (coding regions and flanking UTRs) (Fig. 3A–C). To this end, all early/late genes were aligned to the start codon and average values of a minimal folding energy (MFE) over all genes in each group were predicted within all possible 39-nt length local window. These average MFE values where compared in a position wise manner (Fig. 3A and B) and in average over all positions (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3) to the MFE values expected in random. Positions with significantly strong (more negative MFE) or weak (more positive MFE) folding where identified (Fig. 3A and B) and also global P-value related to the mean average MFE values was computed (Fig. 3C). To make sure that the obtained folding signals were not mainly an indirect consequence of codon usage bias and/or selection for specific dinucleotide contents not related to mRNA folding we employed two randomization models, one designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the distribution of dinucleotides and the other designed to maintain both the encoded protein and the codon usage bias (see the Methods section for more details). (A and B) Profiles of folding energy (average MFE in all windows of 39-nt length) across the bacteriophage genome (blue) vs. an averaged profile corresponding to 100 randomized variants (black) based on dinucleotide preserving randomization; the window index denotes the distance (in nucleotides) from the beginning of the ORF to the beginning of the window. Regions where the folding energy of the wild type genome is significantly higher (red) or lower (green) than in randomized variants are marked at the bottom of the figure. (A) The profiles include the 5'-UTR near the beginning of the ORF (negative window indexes). (B) The profiles include the 3'-UTR near the ending of the ORF (positive window indexes). (C) Histograms of mean local folding energies (folding energies averaged over all the windows of each gene) compared with randomized mean local folding energies obtained from two models: (i) protein + dinucleotides preserving and (ii) protein + codon usage bias preserving (see also Supplementary Fig. S3). (D) Histograms of log[ARS index]. Eight analyses were performed: two types of reference genomes; bacterial and viral, two type of randomizations; dinucleotide and codons, two groups of genes; early and late. In each histogram, the wild type distribution is compared with the mean random distribution (1,000 random genomes). The P-values were calculated according to Wilcoxon signed-rank test.(A and B) Profiles of folding energy (average MFE in all windows of 39-nt length) across the bacteriophage genome (blue) vs. an averaged profile corresponding to 100 randomized variants (black) based on dinucleotide preserving randomization; the window index denotes the distance (in nucleotides) from the beginning of the ORF to the beginning of the window.

In each histogram, the wild type distribution is compared with the mean random distribution (1,000 random genomes). The P-values were calculated according to Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Our analysis suggests that in general, there is an evidence of evolutionary selection for strong folding in the coding region of the bacteriophage in the case of the late genes but not in the case of the early genes and this is not related to very specific region along the coding region (Fig. 3A–C).This selection is manifested by lower average MFE values than expected in random (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3) and a higher number of positions selected for strong folding (27 in the early and 123 in the late genes in Fig. 3A; 37 in the early and 144 in the late genes in Fig. 3B).Local genomic regions (both in UTRs and in coding sequences) selected for strong mRNA folding may be related to various functional mRNA structures in the coding regions that effect the viral life cycle16,17,34; specifically, it is possible that the mRNA structures are more important in the late genes due to less canonical regulatory aspects needed at the later phases of viral life. Interestingly, we found that in the case of the late genes there is an evidence of selection for weak folding at the 5' end of the coding regions, suggesting that there is a significant evolutionary pressure for improved initiation efficiency.34Secondly, we performed an analysis with a measure that detects long sub-sequences in the viral genome (ARS index) and were able to detect gene expression codes in an unsupervised manner35 (see technical details in the Methods section). Our analysis (Fig. 3D) demonstrates that both in the early and late genes there are significant gene expression codes in the bacteriophage coding regions that cannot be explained by the viral codon frequency or dinucleotide composition. These results suggest that in parallel to single codon adaptations, the bacteriophage coding regions undergoes an evolutionary pressure to include more complex/longer regulatory signals in the coding region. This suggests that additional future studies should be performed on this topic.4. ConclusionsThe analyses performed in this study emphasize the way evolution shape the coding region of Bacteriophage Lambda to improve its expression levels and fitness. We demonstrate that evolution shapes the codon content of the Bacteriophage genes to fit them to the dynamic intracellular environment during the Bacteriophage development. Specifically, we show that the codon frequencies of the early and late genes were shaped in a different manner: (i) there is high intra group similarity in codon usage frequencies than inter-group similarities; (ii) the codons frequencies of both groups are significantly different than the codon frequencies of the host; (iii) whilst the decoding rates of both group is higher than expected based on the amino acid content and dinucleotide composition, the mean decoding rate of the early genes is relatively higher/lower than the late genes during the initial/late stages of the viral development, respectively.The results reported here demonstrate and suggest that it may be possible to better understand the function of viral genes via the analysis of their codon distribution. They can also promote developing novel approaches for vaccine development and viral therapies: For example, based on the codon frequencies of different viral ORF we may be able to predict if they are early of late genes. In addition, engineering the viral genome such that its decoding rate (e.g. as measured by ribosome profiling) is attenuated may enable generating live attenuated based vaccines; on the other hand, improving the viral decoding rate may contribute to developing efficient oncolytic viruses and contribute towards developing efficient procedures for generating inactivated vaccines.Our analysis support the conjecture that the that tRNA pool in the host changes during the bactriophage development with a tRNA pool similar to the host pool in natural conditions at the early points but more different than the host natural tRNA pool during the late points (see Fig. 2F). Thus, the accurate measure for estimating the optimization of the codon decoding rates of the bactriophage genes is the TDR and measures based on the genomic tRNA copy number (such as the tAI).Nevertheless, it is important to mention that previous studies suggest that relative levels of tRNAs tend to have high correlation among different conditions and tissues (see for example36,37). This may be related, among others, to the fact that a significant change of tRNA levels ranking may have strong effect on co-translation protein folding (see for example38) and thus a strong effect on the functionality of many proteins, effecting both the host and the bacteriophage. Similar phenomena was observed also in this study—there is significant correlation between codon decoding rates at different time points and the relevant genomic tRNA copy number (see Fig. 2F); however, as mention, this correlation is lower at the later time points.At each time point the ‘optimal’ solution relate to the optimization of translation elongation speed and the optimal allocation of translation factors include using the codons with the highest codon decoding rates (i.e. the ones related to factors such as tRNA molecules that have relatively higher abundance in the cell). Thus, genes undergo selection to have codons similar to the translation factor concentration and this selection is expected to be higher in highly expressed genes (see39,40) in each condition since non-optimality in these genes should have higher effect (in comparison to lowly expressed genes) on the organism/viral fitness; eventually, at early/late stages the early/late genes are expected to have higher mean decoding rate than late/early genes, respectively (as we see in Fig. 2C).Whilst the codons of the early/late genes are different both groups use all the codons. However, the fact that the two groups of genes have different codons also means that they use a little different set of tRNA molecules—the late genes use tRNA molecules less used by the early genes.An interesting topic for future study is measuring the tRNA levels in different time point and an interesting topic for future study will be to perform such measurements to validate and better understand the different codon frequencies of early/late genes.Finally, whilst this study focused on codon frequencies and its relation to translation elongation our analysis suggest that additional regulatory aspects are encoded in via the local folding of the viral RNA and possibly additional viral genomic motives (longer than singe codon; Fig. 3D); these results and the previous ones demonstrate that the complexity and information content of the Bacteriophage genome is higher than thought before and encourages further studies in this direction.Supplementary data are available at DNARES Online.E.G. and A.D. are supported, in part, by a fellowship from the Edmond J.

Here, we provide sequences of four chloroplast genomes from the Lupinus genus, belonging to the underinvestigated Genistoid clade. Notably, we found in Lupinus species the functional loss of the essential rps16 gene, which was most likely replaced by the nuclear rps16 gene that encodes chloroplast and mitochondrion targeted RPS16 proteins. To study the evolutionary fate of the rps16 gene, we explored all available plant chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Whereas no plant mitochondrial genomes carry an rps16 gene, many plants still have a functional nuclear and chloroplast rps16 gene. Ka/Ks ratios revealed that both chloroplast and nuclear rps16 copies were under purifying selection. However, due to the dual targeting of the nuclear rps16 gene product and the absence of a mitochondrial copy, the chloroplast gene may be lost. We also performed comparative analyses of lupine plastomes (SNPs, indels and repeat elements), identified the most variable regions and examined their phylogenetic utility. The markers identified here will help to reveal the evolutionary history of lupines, Genistoids and closely related clades.1. IntroductionThe Fabaceae (or Leguminosae) is one of the largest flowering plant families, with ca. 19,500 herbaceous to tree species (ca. 751 genera) distributed in very diverse ecogeographical areas around the World.1–3 Because of their ability to establish specific associations with nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria,4,5 many legume species are of great ecological and economic interest. They provide valuable biological nitrogen for better productivity and ecosystem functioning, and supply significant sources of protein for human and animal nutrition and health.6 Within Fabaceae, the Papillionoideae clade includes several major crops for human and animal consumption, such as soybean (Glycine), barrel medic (Medicago), bean (Phaseolus), cowpea (Vigna), chickpea (Cicer), pea (Pisum), peanut (Arachis), pigeon pea (Cajanus) and lupine (Lupinus). Increasing our knowledge of the evolutionary history of this family, as well as of the mechanisms involved in its physiological and ecological properties will improve management of natural and agricultural ecosystems and guide plant breeding programs.During the last decade, our understanding of the structural and functional evolutionary dynamics of legume genomes increased significantly due to progress in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. This recent sequencing of many plant plastomes revealed the unusual evolution of the Fabaceae, Geraniaceae and Campanulaceae plastomes.7–13 To date, 34 complete Fabaceae plastomes have been sequenced (including 17 in the last three years), mainly from Papilionoid lineages (25), and a few from the Cesalpinioid (5) and Mimosoid (4) lineages.14–18 Comparative analyses of Fabaceae plastomes showed that they have undergone major structural evolution compared with other plant families, including the lack of one inverted repeat (IR),19 a 51-kb inversion shared by most Papilionoid clades (including species from the IR lacking clade also called IRLC),20–22 a 78-kb inversion in Phaseolae,23–25 a 5.6-kb inversion in Milletia,26 a 36-kb inversion in the Genistoid clade15 and a 39-kb inversion in Robinia.16Although gene content is relatively well conserved in angiosperm plastomes,12,27 it has been shown that several genes, such as accD,7,psaI,12,ycf4, rpl33,12,clpP14,18 or rps1628, have been functionally lost in various legume lineages. Some of these chloroplast genes (accD and rps16), which are essential for plant survival,29–31 were shown to be functionally replaced by a nuclear gene.12,28In contrast to the plastomes of most angiosperm families, Fabaceae plastomes have regions with accelerated mutation rates, including genic regions such as the rps16-ycf4 region in the IRLC clade12 or the clpP gene in Mimosoids.14,18 It has been suggested that this remarkable pattern of variation most likely results from the functional alteration of genes involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination,12,14,32 which may also facilitate the expansion of repeat sequences and the formation of structural rearrangements. For instance, the extensive reorganization of the plastid genome in Trifolium was correlated with an increase in repeat number,7 and the increase in size of the plastid genome in Mimosoids was correlated with tandem repeat expansions.14Until recently, most of the knowledge of legume plastome evolutionary dynamics derived from model and crop plants in the Papilionoid lineage, and specifically the non-protein amino acid-accumulating (NPAA) clade (including Millettioids, Robinioids and IRLC).33 In the last three years, plastomes of other Papilionoids, Mimosoids and Cesalpinioids lineages have been sequenced and have provided additional insights into the unusual plastome evolution of the Fabaceae.14–18 In a few genera (Glycine, Lathyrus, Trifolium), the plastomes of several species were sequenced,12,17,34 contributing to a better understanding of the origin of specific structural variations. Localized hypermutations, gene losses and plastome size variations were identified as well as useful sequence resources were found for phylogenetic inference. However, additional sequencing efforts in key genera of the highly diverse legume family is essential for understanding key features of plastome evolution, and to resolve phylogenetic relationships at these taxonomic levels.The Genistoid clade contains ~18% of the 13,800 Papilionoid taxa.35 Within this poorly-studied lineage, the diverse Lupinus genus is considered as a good model system. Lupinus is composed of hundreds of annual and perennial herbaceous species and a few soft-woody shrubs and trees, which occur in a wide range of ecogeographical conditions. Lupines are mainly distributed in the New World (NW) (from Alaska to southern Chile and Argentina), whereas ~20 species and subspecies are native to the Old World (OW) where two groups are distinguished: the smooth-seeded (circum-Mediterranean) and the rough-seeded lupines (scattered in North-equatorial Africa).36 In addition, this genus includes some crop species37 (Lupinus albus, Lupinus luteus, Lupinus angustifolius, Lupinus mutabilis), which are of growing interest due to their high seed protein content, their potential as nitrogen producers and for their health benefits.37,38 Molecular phylogenetic investigations using nuclear (ITS, nrDNA, LEGCYC1A, SymRK) and chloroplastic (rbcL, matK, trnL-trnF, trnL-trnT, trnL-intron, trnS-trnG) regions drastically improved knowledge of the evolutionary history of this complex genus.39–44 Many clades have been well circumscribed, and patterns of diversification were identified in both the NW and the OW. In spite of these significant advances, there are still uncertainties and unresolved relationships to be elucidated, such as for instance: (i) basal relationships between the NW and OW lineages in the Lupinus phylogeny; (ii) relationships amongst the OW lineages and within the African clade; and (iii) the enigmatic position of some taxa (e.g. Floridian lupines).44,45Recently, the plastome of L. luteus was published, representing the first chloroplast genome sequenced in Lupinus and in the Genistoid lineage.15 Comparison with other legume plastomes allowed the discovery that the Genistoids share a 36-kb inversion, and the identification of mutational hotspots representing potentially informative regions for evolutionary studies. However, these identified regions, such as the ycf4 gene in the NPAA clade12 or the clpP in the IRLC and Mimosoids,14 may be of interest only in particular clades, due to a specific accelerated evolutionary rate in these lineages. Thus, additional plastomes are needed to specifically understand the plastome evolution of the lupine/Genistoid lineage and to accurately identify their most variable regions that are of phylogenetic significance. In this context, we sequenced four novel lupine plastomes: two Mediterranean smooth-seeded species, L. albus and Lupinus micranthus Guss. and two rough-seeded species, Lupinus atlanticus Glads. and Lupinus princei Harms. Comparative analyses were performed among the five OW lupine plastomes (including the previously published L. luteus15) at the structural (inversions, indels, repeat numbers and distribution), gene and sequence levels, in order to better understand their evolutionary dynamics and to identify novel phylogenetically informative regions. More specifically, sequencing of these four additional plastomes revealed the pseudogenization of the chloroplast rps16 gene in Lupinus species. Analyses of the Ka/Ks ratios of the functional chloroplast and the nuclear rps16 genes (both encoding the same chloroplast RPS16 protein) from some representative Angiosperm species revealed that both copies were under purifying selection. However, since the nuclear rps16 gene also encodes the mitochondrial RPS16 protein and that this gene is lost in the mitochondrial genomes of all plants sequenced to date, the loss of the nuclear rps16 gene would be detrimental for plant survival. This could explain why only the chloroplast rps16 gene has been functionally lost many times during plant evolution, despite being under purifying selection. In addition, investigations on the evolutionary dynamic of the lupine plastomes (mutations, indels and repeated elements) allowed identification of variable characters and regions. The phylogenetic interest of these regions in the genus Lupinus was tested using representative species of the main lupine clades.2. Material and methods2.1. Plant material and DNA isolationGenomic DNA of 30 lupine species was extracted from fresh leaves using the NucleoSpin® Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The genomic DNA extracts of four Lupinus species (L. albus, L. micranthus, L. atlanticus and L. princei) were subjected to NGS for plastome reconstruction. DNA extracts from the other 26 lupine species were used in different evolutionary tests on genes and regions of interest; including four OW rough-seeded species (L. digitatus, L. cosentinii, L. anatolicus and L. pilosus); three OW smooth-seeded species (L. hispanicus subsp. bicolor, L. angustifolius subsp. angustifolius and L. angustifolius subsp. reticulatus); and fourteen species representing the main known groups in the NW lupines. Among these are (i) five members of the North and South East American clade (L. texensis, L. paraguariensis, L. gibertianus and L. sellowianus); (ii) nine members from various groups mainly occurring in western regions of North, Central and South America (L. affinis, L. hirsitussimus, L. luteolus, L. nanus, L. polyphyllus, L. mutabilis, L. mexicanus, L. elegans, two unidentified samples L. sp. from Equator); (iii) and two Florida endemic species (L. diffusus and L. villosus). Moreover, the DNA of three representatives from the Genista-Cytisus complex, sister group to Lupinus in the Genisteae46 tribe were obtained: Retama sphaerocarpa, Cytisus battandieri and Genista erioclada. More details on geographic origins and reference numbers of these plant materials are presented in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. High throughput sequencing, plastome assembly and annotationThe genomic DNA of L. albus, L. micranthus, L. atlanticus and L. princei were subjected to high-throughput sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (BGI, Hong-Kong). One flow cell containing a library of each species was used, yielding ~11 millions of 100 bp paired-end (PE) reads (insert size = 500 bp) for each library, except L. micranthus, for which ~5.5 millions of PE reads were obtained.De novo chloroplast genome (plastomes) assemblies were performed using Paired End Illumina reads and ‘The organelle assembler’ software (http://metabarcoding.org/asm (January 2015, date last accessed))47: its aim is to assemble over represented sequences such as organelle genomes (chloroplast or mitochondrion), or the rDNA cistron. Each draft plastome sequence was then verified and corrected by mapping the Illumina reads against each genome using Bowtie 2 v2.0.48 A few uncertain nucleotides were verified by Sanger sequencing. Plastome annotation was performed using DOGMA (Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator, http://dogma.ccbb.utexas.edu (January 2015, date last accessed))49 and by aligning each of the four newly constructed plastomes with the published L. luteus plastome (KC69566615). A graphical representation of each plastome was drawn using Circos50 (Supplementary Figs S1–S4).2.3. Identification of rps16 gene sequences in plant mitochondrion, chloroplast and nuclear genomesSequences of the rps16 gene were searched for all non-parasitic plant mitochondrion, chloroplast and nuclear genomes available to date. Organelle and nuclear genomes were downloaded from GenBank (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (November 2016, date last accessed)) and Phytozome v11 (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html (November 2016, date last accessed)), respectively. For the nuclear rps16 genes, presence in mature proteins of a signal peptide targeting the proteins to the organelles was tested using BaCelLo,51 ProteinProwler,52 TargetP,53 MultiLoc254 and Predotar.55 In addition, as the chloroplast rps16 gene has a subgroup IIB intron, we looked for the presence of the correct splicing of this intron by verifying the presence of the strictly conserved splicing sites (GTGYG and AY at the 5' and 3' splice sites of the intron, respectively)56–59 in all chloroplast rps16 genes with a complete coding sequence (742 species).2.4. Selective pressure acting on the nuclear and chloroplast rps16 genesWithin a subset of plants representing the main clades of Angiosperms (Arabidopsis lyrata: Brassicales; Citrus sinensis: Sapindales; Cucumis sativus: Cucurbitales; Glycine max: Fabales; Manihot esculentum: Malpighiales; Musa acuminata: Zingiberales; Oryza sativa: Poales; Panicum virgatum: Poales; Prunus persica: Rosales; Solanum lycopersicum: Solanales; Theobroma cacao: Malvales; Vitis vinifera: Vitales), we retrieved the functional nuclear and chloroplast rps16 gene sequences, which both encode the chloroplast RPS16 proteins. The different nuclear or chloroplast copies were aligned using Geneious v6.1.860 and the alignments were adjusted manually. Non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitution rates were evaluated using the yn00 method implemented in PAML61 for the nuclear and chloroplast rps16 sequences. A list of species considered and the accession numbers of nuclear and chloroplast rps16 sequences used are presented in Supplementary Table S2. Ka/Ks analyses of chloroplast rps16 gene were also performed using only the representatives of the following Angiosperm families: Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae.2.5. Sequence divergence among lupine plastomesTo identify the most variable regions among lupine chloroplast genomes, the five plastomes were aligned using Geneious v6.1.860 and pairwise comparisons between each of the five plastomes were performed to evaluate the percentage of identity in sliding window frames of 1 kb with a Python custom script. Using this script, insertion-deletions (indels) with a minimum size of 20 bp were identified. These large indels as well as pairwise comparisons results were represented graphically using Circos.50 Additionally, the five aligned plastomes were screened to identify autapomorphous (single) and shared indels of at least 2 bp, and the excluding regions with homopolymers or with ambiguous overlapping indels. Sequence divergence among the five lupine plastomes (including L. luteus) was also evaluated independently for intergenic spacers, introns, exons, rRNAs and tRNAs by calculating pairwise distances between homologous regions. Pairwise distances were determined with the ape R-cran Package62 (available at: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/ape.pdf) using the Kimura 2-parameters (K2p) evolution model for introns and intergenic spacers.63 Additionally, sequence divergence of protein encoding sequences was estimated using the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) nucleotide substitution rates with the yn00 method64 from the PAML package.61Repeat sequences in each lupine plastome were identified using REPuter65 with similar parameters as previously described for the analysis of Fabaceae plastomes7,15,25,66 and excluding one copy of the IR. Palindrome sequences as well as dispersed direct and IRs of a minimum length of 30 bp and presenting at least 90% sequence identity were identified (Hamming distance of three). Additionally, mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotides Short Sequence Repeats (SSRs) with a mininimal size of 12 bp and a minimal repeat number of five were detected using the Phobos software67 implemented in Geneious v6.1.8.602.6. PCR amplification of the rps16 gene and the most variable regions in lupinesSeveral primer pairs were designed using Primer 3.068 to examine the variation of the rps16 gene and two fast evolving regions (psaA-ycf4 and ycf1-rps15) in Lupinus. For rps16, the following primer pairs were used: F-CCGTCCCAGAGCATATTCAG, R-GCAACGATTCGATAAATGGC and F-CCCATTCATATCGAAGGAAAACT, R-CCATCATGTACTATTTACATCATCAATC and R-CTATATACAAGTCATCCACACCCTC. Within the fast evolving regions, primer pairs were designed to amplify four sub-regions (accD and ycf1 genes, ycf1-rps15 and trnFGAA-trnLUAA 5'-3' intergenic spacers): accD with F-GTCTATAAATACATTACCCCCG, R-TGTCTTCATCCATAGGATTCC; ycf1-rps15 with F-GATTTATGTTGCACAAACCG, R-CATTGATGGGTGGTGAGG; trnFGAA-trnLUAA with F-TTGAACTGGTGACACGAGG, R-TGGCGAAATTGGTAGACG. Because of the large size of the ycf1, two primer pairs were designed: ycf1 part1 with F-AATCAAGCAGAAAGTTATGGG, R-CTTACATCTTTTGAGCTTTCACTC; ycf1 part2 with F-GGAATGGAAGTAGAATTGCC, R-TTTTGTTTACGCGTCTTGT.PCR amplifications of these regions were carried out for 32 taxa (including three Genisteae outgroups, Supplementary Table S1) in a total volume of 50 µl, containing 5× Green GoTaq flexi Reaction Buffer (Promega), 0.2 mM of dNTP, 0.2 µM of each primer, 1.25 Unit of G2 flexi DNA polymerase (Promega), mqH2O and 20 ng of template DNA. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 48–52 °C (adapted according to the primer pairs used) for 30 s, 72 °C for 90 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were purified using the NucleoSpin gel and PCR clean up kit (Macherey Nagel), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified PCR products were sequenced directly (in both directions) by Sanger at Macrogen Europe (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All sequences were deposited in Genbank under the accession numbers, KX147685 to KX147753 and KX787895 to KX787910.2.7. Phylogenetic analysesFor each of the four chloroplast regions investigated, all lupine sequences were aligned using MAFFT implemented in Geneious v6.1.8.60,69 The resulting alignments were adjusted manually. In addition, a concatenated data matrix was constructed using the sequences obtained from the four regions (accD and ycf1 genes, ycf1-rps15 and trnFGAA-trnLUAA 5'-3' intergenic spacers). These matrices were first subjected to phylogenetic analyses using Maximum Parsimony (MP). Bootstrap analyses were performed with 1,000 replicates.70 These data matrices were also subjected to Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses. The best-fitted model of sequence evolution for each region (individual or concatenated) was determined using JModeltest71 and ML analyses were then performed for each matrix with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 6.0.723. Results and discussion3.1. Structure, organization and gene content of lupine plastomesThe Illumina PE reads obtained for L. albus, L. atlanticus, L. micranthus and L. princei, were used to assemble their chloroplast genome sequences (deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KU726826; KU726827; KU726828; KU726829, respectively). The four plastomes harbor a quadripartite structure (a Large Single Copy and a Small Single Copy separated by two IRs) with a total length ranging from 151,808 bp to 152,272 bp. As expected from previous PCR-based evidence, they all have the 36-kb inversion that occurred at the base of the Genistoid emergence or soon after.15 The different Lupinus plastomes have similar gene, intron and GC content (Table 1) as do most photosynthetic and non-parasitic angiosperm plastomes.11 The genes are distributed into three main categories: self-replication (58 genes), photosynthesis (47 genes) and other functions (six genes) (Supplementary Table S3). Among these genes, 76 are protein-encoding genes, 30 encode tRNAs and four encode rRNAs. None of the genes known to be lost or pseudogenized in other legume lineages, such as accD,7,psaI, ycf4, rpl23 or rpl3312 are missing in the lupine plastomes. Interestingly, comparative analyses of the lupine plastomes (including L. luteus) revealed a likely loss of functionality of the rps16 gene in L. albus and L. micranthus but not in the other species. Both pseudogenes showed a deletion (verified by Sanger sequencing), which lead to a pre-mature stop codon (19 and 20 amino acids earlier in L. albus and L. micranthus, respectively) within the functional domain of the RPS16 protein (Fig. 1). To determine if these truncated rps16 genes in L. albus and L. micranthus are still functional, we used pfam (pfam-A, default parameters)73 to search for the presence of a functional domain in the five lupine species investigated in this study. No RPS16 functional domain could be identified in L. albus and L. micranthus only, clearly suggesting that rps16 is a pseudogene in these two lupine species. Recently, an additional way at the origin of the loss of functionality of the chloroplast rps16 gene was identified and corresponds to the loss of its splicing capacity.59 In lupines, we observed that the rps16 intron is not correctly spliced. This suggests that the rps16 is not functional in the five chloroplast genomes (all five lupine plastomes must therefore have 76 functional protein-coding genes), and that the loss of functionality most likely occurred first via the loss of the ability to splice the intron. Thereafter, additional mutations in L. albus and L. micranthus led to pre-mature stop codons. Whether this shared pre-mature stop codon results from a common ancestor or from independent mutational events needs to more accurately resolve phylogenetic relationships of these two species among the OW lupines (see later in the phylogenetic section). Sequencing of the rps16 gene in other lupines and closely related species revealed that another population of L. micranthus has a pseudo rps16, and that it is also defunct in L. angustifolius, Lupinus mariae-josephae, L. villosus and in a member of the Lupinus sister group, G. erioclada (data not shown).

Evolutionary dynamic and fate of the rps16 gene in plant mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear genomesAs in some Lupinus species, the chloroplast rps16 gene was missing in many other Fabaceae, including P. vulgaris and the IRLC.12 In this family, the chloroplast rps16 gene, which is essential for plant survival, has been functionally replaced by a nuclear gene that can encode both mitochondrial and chloroplast RPS16 proteins.28 To better understand the origin and evolutionary fate of rps16 genes residing in different genome compartments but with similar functions, we searched for plant chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear rps16 genes in the currently available nuclear and organelle genomes. In total, we investigated 52 nuclear, 289 mitochondrion and 1,166 chloroplast genomes from the non-parasitic brown and green plant lineages (Haptophytes, Stramenopiles, Glaucophytes, Rhodophytes, Chlorophytes and Streptophytes). Within all the sequenced mitochondrial genomes, no rps16 gene was found, whereas a functional (no pre-mature stop codon) nuclear rps16 gene copy was observed in all species investigated. The loss of the mitochondrial rps16 gene before the divergence of the Glaucophyta from Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta and Streptophyta lineages suggests that the transfer of rps16 from the mitochondrion to the nucleus occurred ~1,500 million years ago74 (Fig. 2), which is much earlier than previously determined (i.e. before the emergence of angiosperms).28 As the rps16 gene was lost from the mitochondrion before divergence of the green lineage and as the nuclear rps16 gene encodes mitochondrion RPS16 proteins, its functional loss from the nuclear genome would be detrimental. As expected, a peptide signal targeting the nuclear encoded RPS16 proteins to the mitochondrion was identified in all species investigated, while the presence of a chloroplast target peptide was predicted in only a few species (Supplementary Table S4). However, it is likely that all species present a nuclear rps16 gene that can target the protein to both the mitochondria and plastids, as previously demonstrated by.28 Indeed, these authors showed experimentally that in two species that have lost the rps16 gene from their chloroplast (Medicago truncatula and Populus alba), and for which the nuclear encoded RPS16 proteins were only predicted to be localized in the mitochondrion (Supplementary Table S4), the RPS16 proteins were targeted to both organelles. It is thus very likely that despite the absence of a predicted chloroplast target peptide, nuclear-encoded RPS16 proteins are targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Genome localization of the rps16 gene(s) encoding the mitochondrial and chloroplast RPS16 proteins in Archeaplastida. Early in Archeaplastida, the mitochondrial rps16 gene was transferred to the nucleus (nuc) and acquired a signal peptide targeting both mitochondrion (mt) and chloroplast (cp). In Glaucophytes and Red Algae, the mitochondrial rps16 gene is always absent whereas it is present in 13 Rhodophyta chloroplast genomes (no plastome sequence available from Glaucophytes). In the core Chlorophyta lineage, none of the 76 species having a fully sequenced chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes have a rps16 gene. In the Streptophyta lineage, no rps16 gene was found in the mitochondrial genomes, whereas the chloroplast rps16 gene may either be functional or loss its functionality (complete gene loss, presence of a pre-mature stop codon or loss of the splicing capacity). Tree was redrawn according to Ref.97,98Genome localization of the rps16 gene(s) encoding the mitochondrial and chloroplast RPS16 proteins in Archeaplastida. Early in Archeaplastida, the mitochondrial rps16 gene was transferred to the nucleus (nuc) and acquired a signal peptide targeting both mitochondrion (mt) and chloroplast (cp). In Glaucophytes and Red Algae, the mitochondrial rps16 gene is always absent whereas it is present in 13 Rhodophyta chloroplast genomes (no plastome sequence available from Glaucophytes). In the core Chlorophyta lineage, none of the 76 species having a fully sequenced chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes have a rps16 gene. In the Streptophyta lineage, no rps16 gene was found in the mitochondrial genomes, whereas the chloroplast rps16 gene may either be functional or loss its functionality (complete gene loss, presence of a pre-mature stop codon or loss of the splicing capacity). Tree was redrawn according to Ref.97,98Within the chloroplast genomes investigated (1,166), the rps16 gene was found to be missing (total absence of the gene or truncated proteins due to pre-mature stop codon) in 312 genomes. We looked for the presence of correct splicing sites in chloroplast rps16 genes with a complete coding sequence and an intron. We found that 434 and 306 had or did not have the splicing capacity, respectively. Among the latter, 197 exhibited mutations in both 5' and 3' splice sites, whereas 22 and 87 had mutations only at the 5' or the 3' splice sites, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). As previously observed, this gene has lost its functionality many times during flowering plant evolution,12 by the loss of either all or part of the coding sequence or of the splicing sites. Dating back to 1,500 MYA, chloroplast RPS16 proteins can be produced by either nuclear or chloroplast rps16 genes. Our results highlight the fact that even though the chloroplast rps16 gene could have been non-functional in all plant genomes since then, it is still present and functional in most plants.To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the rps16 gene, we analysed the selective pressure acting on functional chloroplast and nuclear rps16 genes among 12 species representing the main angiosperms clades. As the rps16 gene was functional in both chloroplast and nuclear genomes and as only the chloroplast copy is likely to be lost, the selective constraints acting on the chloroplast gene could be relaxed. Results of Ka/Ks ratios revealed a strong purifying selection for both chloroplast and nuclear rps16 (average Ka/Ks ratio: 0.045 ± se 0.010 and 0.1707 ± se 0.003 for nuclear and chloroplast copies, respectively; Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Ka/Ks ratios of cp-rps16 for each of the main Angiosperm families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae) were also calculated for all cp-rps16 found with a complete coding sequence and a correctly spliced intron. Results were similar for each of the five families investigated and revealed a strong purifying selection acting on all the tested datasets (average of Ka/Ks ratios always lower than 0.23; Supplementary Table S8). A possible explanation of this strong negative selection pressure still acting on the chloroplast rps16 gene and the presence of a functional chloroplast rps16 gene in many plant genomes (in contrast with plant mitochondrial genomes) is that the chloroplast rps16 gene may function or be regulated slightly better than the nuclear gene under certain conditions.Although these results revealed the multiple status (absent, truncated, incorrectly spliced, functional) of the chloroplast rps16 gene among the plant kingdom and confirmed the hypothesis of59 that the loss of splicing capacity is widely spread through plant species, mechanisms beyond the conservation of the chloroplast copy in most species remain unknown. Indeed, the chloroplast rps16 gene is still essential in certain plant species as revealed by knock-down studies in tobacco.29 Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the retention of some genes within the organelle genomes. The current most widely accepted hypothesis corresponds to the Colocation of gene and gene product for redox regulation of gene expression (or CoRR).75–77 This hypothesis concerns genes that are redox-dependant (such as rbcL; rps2,3,4,7,8,11,12,14,19; rpl2,14,16,20,36).77 However, the chloroplast rps16 gene has been found to be redox independent.78 An alternative hypothesis that was considered concerned the retention of the ribosomal assembly genes in the organelle.79 A ‘core set’ of ribosomal genes were identified in all plants investigated,79 however, rps16 was not included. Another possible explanation of the retention of a functional chloroplast rps16 gene in many species may be due to the loss of the chloroplast target peptide of the nuclear-encoded RPS16 protein (despite the fact that the mitochondrion rps16 target signal remain retained).3.3. Lupine plastome variabilityTo identify putative mutation hotspots, pairwise comparisons of the five lupine plastomes were performed and showed that they have a very high level of sequence identity (98% on average). The two African species (L. atlanticus and L. princei), which are the most closely related lupine species investigated in this study, exhibit the highest identity (99.7%); whereas the species with the lowest sequence identity are L. luteus and L. micranthus (97.9%). These comparisons also enabled identification of 164 non-ambiguous indels along the chloroplast genomes, including 14 with a size ranging from 20 to 357 bp. Of the 164 indels, 50% are 5–6 bp long. These analyses revealed two highly variable regions (Fig. 3). The first region spans from psaA to ycf4 (~11.5 kb) and was already identified as a hypermutable region.12 This region contains 11 genes: psaA, ycf4, ycf3, trnS-GGA, psbI, psbK, trnQ-UUG, rps16, accD and psaI genes, for which four genes (accD, rps16, ycf4, psaI) were shown to be functionally lost in at least one legume species. The second most variable region includes the ycf1-rps15 genes (~6.5 kb). The ycf1 gene, which encodes a translocon protein of the inner chloroplast membrane,80 is larger than 5 kb in lupines and is highly variable with the exception of a 5' fragment duplicated in the IR (519 bp in lupines). This gene was recently identified as one of the most variable chloroplast genes in Angiosperms and is considered as a powerful tool for DNA barcoding.81,82 The longest hypervariable region (psaA-ycf4) contains the highest number of indels (25), with 11 (among the 14 present in the genome) between 20 and 357 bp. Some of these large indels will most likely be useful to discriminate lupine species and/or groups of species from other Lupinus lineages or from other closely related genera.

As expected, the lowest rates of variation were observed for tRNA and rRNA (maximum K2p value: 0.0141, Supplementary Table S9). For introns (Supplementary Table S9, Supplementary Fig. S6A), average of K2p rates ranged from 0.0006 (ndhB intron) to 0.0263 (clpP intron 1). Compared with the K2p analyses performed by,15 who estimated sequence divergence between L. luteus and other legume species, our overall K2p values obtained by comparing only lupine species are, as expected, significantly lower (Wilcoxon test, P-value = 0.05; see Fig. 4A). Among the five lupine species considered, the clpP intron 1, rpl16, rpoC1 and ndhA introns exhibit the higher K2p values. The most variable intron in lupines corresponds to the first intron of clpP, which also showed accelerated mutation rate in Mimosoideae.14,18 The trnK and trnL introns previously used for legumes and lupines phylogenies were found to only exhibit high variation when comparing L. luteus to other Fabaceae.

Asterisks represent a statistically significant difference (P.value: 0.05).K2p values for IGSs ranged from 0 to 0.0434 (Supplementary Table S9, Supplementary Fig. S6B). In comparison to the commonly-used IGSs in legume phylogenetic studies (trnF_trnL, mean K2p = 0.0185, 428 bp; trnL_trnT, 0.0182, 633 bp; trnS_trnG, 0.0181, 799 bp), 36 IGS regions present a higher K2p values, and 15 of them are larger than 300 bp, and thus may be useful for phylogenetic studies. This analysis allowed detection of two relatively variable IGS sequences, corresponding to ycf1_rps15 (mean K2p = 0.0355, aligned length = 470 bp) and rpl32_ndhF (0.0322, 486 bp) that were not detected in previous analysis (Fig. 4B).Non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates were calculated for protein-coding sequences, as well as the Ka/Ks ratio (Supplementary Tables S10–S12). The mean Ks among the five lupines studied ranged from 0 (petG, petL, petN, psaJ, psbF, psbI, psbM, rpl23, rpl33, rps7) to 0.05049 (psbT). All protein-encoding genes have a Ks value lower than 0.1. Similarly, the non-synonymous substitution rate (Ka) was lower than 0.025 for all genes. Finally, Ka/Ks ratios were calculated for each protein-coding region in order to determine the selective constraint acting on each gene. Almost all genes evolved under high purifying selective constraint (53 of the 77 genes have a Ka/Ks ratio lower than 0.2), except for six genes (matK, rpoA, ycf2, rpoC2, accD and ycf1) that show a ratio > 0.5 (including three genes evolving almost neutrally (matK, rpoA, ycf2; Supplementary Fig. S7). Except for ycf1 and ycf2, the other genes were not identified as neutrally evolving between legumes and L. luteus.15 Comparison of Ka/Ks ratios obtained when considering only lupine species to the Ka/Ks ratios obtained when comparing L. luteus15 to other legumes, revealed 14 genes that exhibit higher Ka/Ks ratios between lupines than between L. luteus and legumes. Among these genes, only six are significantly higher (accD, ndhF, psbB, rbcL, rpoB and rsp2; Fig. 5). However, detailed analysis of these genes (synonymous and non-synonymous substitution comparisons; and codon-based ML phylogenetic analyses; results not shown) did not reveal significant accelerated mutation rates at either synonymous or non-synonymous sites. Conversely, the ycf4 gene and the flanking cemA and accD genes, which were found to be highly variable in the Lathyrus and Desmodium clades,12 were more stable, lacking major rearrangements in Lupinus. These results highlight that fast-evolving regions may strongly differ among clades within a family.

The x-axis corresponds to the CDS regions. Asterisks represent a statistically significant difference (P.value: 0.05).To explore the putative phylogenetic utility of different chloroplast regions, potentially informative sites (Pi) were evaluated among lupines in: (i) complete chloroplast genomes, (ii) protein-coding sequences, (iii) intergenic spacers, (iv) introns and (v) in the two hypervariable regions (psaA-ycf4 and ycf1-rps15) (Table 2). Results revealed 666 Pi (among 2,874 variables sites) in the five aligned plastomes, which are distributed as follow: 45.3% of the Pi in IGS, 38.3% in CDS and only 11.4% in introns. The remaining five percent are located in tRNA and rRNA genes. The two hypervariable regions containing psaA-ycf4 and ycf1-rps15, account for 8.7 and 14.3% of the total number of Pi, respectively. Molecular phylogenies were performed using either complete plastomes, or introns, or IGS or CDS, and revealed a similar topology (Supplementary Fig. S5), with the rough-seeded species (L. atlanticus and L. princei) in a well-supported clade (always with 100% of bootstrap support) clearly distinct from the smooth-seeded species L. albus, L. luteus and L. micranthus. Among the latter, L. albus was always the closest Mediterranean lupine to the rough-seeded group (86–87% of bootstrap value based on either IGS or complete plastome data). These results differ from previous phylogenies40,41,44,45 based on single or few genes (chloroplast and nuclear genes), which found L. micranthus to be the closest Mediterranean lupine to the rough-seeded species. In addition, the whole plastome phylogenies provide, for the first time, strong evidence (97–99% bootstrap support) of a common ancestor for L. micranthus, L. albus and the rough-seeded lupines, which are positioned as sister group to L. luteus. MP analyses (using PAUP483) of the five aligned lupine plastomes, with or without the 164 non-ambiguous indels (coded as 0 or 1 for the presence of a deletion or an insertion, respectively), led to the same results (not shown). To further investigate the phylogenetic utility of the most variable lupine regions identified, we amplified and sequenced five chloroplast regions (accD, two parts of the ycf1 gene and the ycf1-rps15 and trnFGAA-trnLUAA 5'-3' intergenic spacers, length ranging from 800 to 2,000 bp) from 16 lupine species. Each matrix was subjected to ML analysis. After verifying the absence of incongruence between the trees obtained for the five different regions, a concatenated matrix of all regions was analysed, following the conditional-combination approach.84,L. villosus and L. anatolicus were not considered in this analysis, as not all regions were amplified in these two species. The ML tree obtained from this latter matrix is presented in Fig. 6. Despite low resolution of the basal nodes, the topology is consistent with an early divergence of the lupines into two main lineages: the OW lineage comprising all the smooth- and rough-seeded Mediterranean and African taxa, which includes the representative of the Floridian species (L. diffusus) and the NW lineage composed of all American taxa from diverse origins (except L. diffusus). Within these two main lineages, most clades are consistent with previous phylogenies40,41,44,45 and some of them present very high support using these cpDNA data, such as: (i) the OW rough-seeded species (L. atlanticus, L. cosentinii, L. digitatus, L. pilosus and L. princei) with a bootstrap value of 99%; (ii) the Mediterranean smooth-seeded lupines L. luteus and L. hispanicus subsp. bicolor (which together form the lutei section) with 100% bootstrap support, linked to L. angustifolius as sister group; (iii) the clade including the Texan lupines and the eastern South American species (L. texensis, L. paraguariensis and L. gibertianus) with 100% bootstrap support, (iv) and a clade (100% bootstrap support) corresponding to the Western American and Mexican species (L. polyphyllus, L. mutabilis, L. mexicanus and the undetermined lupine from Ecuador). Support for these clades is reinforced by synapomorphic indels (Fig. 6). Within the OW lineage, the Mediterranean smooth-seeded species do not form a distinct clade and appear as paraphyletic to the rough-seeded group and the Floridian L. diffusus, L. albus and L. micranthus are placed (with 88% bootstrap support) as the closest Mediterranean smooth-seeded lupines to the rough-seeded species. In this phylogeny, L. albus is sister to L. micranthus, with moderate bootstrap support (75%) rather than to the rough-seeded lupins (with a bootstrap support of 86–87%), as observed in the whole plastome based phylogenies (see above and Supplementary Fig. S5). This incongruence might be explained by the low number of taxa or to the different sequence datasets analysed in these phylogenies (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. S5). Further investigation to resolve such phylogenetic uncertainty is needed. Compared with previous Lupinus phylogenies, based on chloroplast (matK, rbcL, trnL intron, trnL-trnF, trnS-trnG, trnT-trnL) or nuclear sequences (LEGCYC1A, LEGCYC1B, ITS1 + 2, GPAT1, GPAT2, SymRK, ETS),39,40,42,44,85 our five hypervariable chloroplast regions may not have revealed novel relationships but strongly reinforced support for some known clades (such as the West and the East American groups, or the OW rough-seeded section). Moreover, they provided additional and significant data supporting the singular Floridian unifoliolate lupines (represented here by L. diffusus), for which phylogenetic placement has always been questionable, as close relative to the OW lupines rather than to the NW ones (at least from the maternally inherited plastome). Finally, we showed the phylogenetic utility of these two identified regions but the consideration of a higher number of lupines and related species will allow for optimal exploitation of their potential to inform these phylogenies, and improve our knowledge of the evolutionary history of lupine and closely related Genistoid clades that are poorly investigated.

In chloroplast genomes repeats are involved in various structural rearrangements, such as inversions, insertions or deletions. These structural modifications sometimes lead to pseudogenization or duplication as well as to plastome expansion or contraction.10,14,19,86–88 The most striking example of the involvement of repeat sequences in genome size change was observed in Geraniaceae, where the plastome size varies from 128,787 bp to 217,942 bp in Monsonia speciosa and Pelargonium hortorum species, respectively.9 In Fabaceae, repeat sequences were also shown to be involved in LSC extension in Mimosoids14 or related to structural rearrangements, as in Trifolium subterraneum that presents numerous reorganization events and a very high percentage of repeated elements (20% of its genome). Recently, a 29 bp IR in the trnSGGA and trnSGCU was found to be at the origin of a large 36 kb inversion discovered in L. luteus (and Genisteae), through a flip-flop recombination event.15 This inversion was regarded as a new powerful clade marker for most Genistoids in legumes and our study confirmed the presence of this inversion in the four additional Lupinus plastomes investigated here. Since these short inverted repeats (separated by at least 30 kb) are present in almost all known Fabaceae plastomes,15 it has been underlined that such inversion events could have occurred and could occur again elsewhere via the same mechanism.15 Interestingly,16 recently discovered an independent 39 kb inversion at exactly the same location in Robinia pseudoacacia among 13 taxa investigated. This result confirms the potential of such repeats in plastome dynamics, and demonstrates that even rarely occurring, large inversions might result from independent events in distantly related taxa, such as here in Robinioids and Genistoids, biasing their phylogenetic utility. Despite the homoplasious nature of these inversions, such remarkable parallel inversions could be cautiously used as clade evolutionary markers in each of the affected lineages. Because of the importance of repeated elements in plastome evolution (particularly in Fabaceae), we investigated the type and number of repeats present in each Lupinus plastome using REPuter.65 A total of 142 repeats were identified across the five Lupinus species. These repeats, which are relatively well distributed along the plastome sequences (Fig. 7), were divided into three categories, (i) palindromes (60 repeats), (ii) forward repeats (45 repeats) and (iii) reverse repeats (37 repeats). Although all five chloroplast genomes show a relatively similar number of repeats (24 in L. albus to 33 in L. princei) and confirm previous results obtained by15, we identified three, four, nine and six repeats specific to L. atlanticus, L. albus, L. micranthus and L. luteus, respectively.

Distribution of these repeats (mononucleotides, dispersed and palindromic) along plastomes was characterized, revealing that around 70% of the repeats are in the LSC, whereas 20% and 10% are localized in the SSC and IR, respectively. Within the plastome, most of the repeats are situated in the highly variable regions of the LSC, in the rps12-trnVGAC intergenic spacer of the IR and in the intron of ndhA in the SSC. The five lupine plastomes exhibit a similar pattern of repeat distribution, with more than half of the repeats localized in the non-coding regions, around 30% are in protein-coding sequences and around 15% are in introns. Only two dispersed repeats (shared by all lupines) were found in tRNA genes, including the inverted repeat found to be involved in the 36-kb inversion.15 While performing these analyses, we also paid particular attention to Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs or microsatellites) that are particularly interesting in a wide range of genetic studies in population genetics, plant evolution and domestication, or for the estimation of gene and pollen flow.89–96 We found between 37 (L. princei) and 51 (L. luteus) microsatellites longer than 12 bp in lupine plastomes, with mononucleotide repeats representing between 70 and 80% of these microsatellites, compared with only 16–30% and 0–5%, of di- and tri-nucleotide SSRs, respectively. The ycf1 gene, which corresponds to the most variable lupine plastome regions, is the richest region in SSRs, with ~20% of the total microsatellites. In comparison, the second hypervariable region (psaA-ycf4) presents only zero to five percent of SSRs (Supplementary Table S13). Among the 213 SSRs identified within the five plastomes, nine are perfectly shared by all species, two additional shared SSRs vary in size, whereas the others are species or group-specific and thus represent potentially useful markers. Taken together, the various kinds of markers revealed from this study (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms or SNPs, indels, repeats and inversions) represent important resources of genetic/genomic markers with which to deepen our investigations of Lupinus and its Genistoid allies, and for comparative analyses in legumes.4. Conclusion and further perspectivesIn this work, four additional lupine chloroplast genomes were sequenced, assembled and analysed at different levels. This study provides novel insights into the chloroplast genome evolutionary dynamics in the poorly studied Genistoid clade. Our results revealed highly conserved structure and gene content among the five Lupinus species with the exception of the rps16 gene, which is very likely pseudogenized in the different lupine species investigated. Detailed surveys of mitochondrion, nuclear and chloroplast genomes available to date revealed that rps16 gene is absent from all plant mitochondria, strongly suggesting that this gene was functionally replaced by the nuclear rps16 gene since the divergence of plants. Compared with the mitochondrion, the chloroplast rps16 gene is still present in many plants but has lost its functionality many times independently. Analysis of the evolution rate of functional rps16 genes present in both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of some representative angiosperm species revealed that these genes are both under purifying selection, whereas a relaxed selective constraint was expected for the chloroplast copy. Comparative analyses of lupine plastomes also enabled identification of two hypervariable regions: psaA-ycf4 (11.5 kb) and ycf1-rps15 (6.5 kb). We demonstrate that these regions, which contain a high number of potentially informative sites and the highest number of SSRs, were highly consistent with, and reinforced the support for, previous phylogenies. The analyses of the short repeated sequences present in Lupinus plastomes allowed us to identify different types of chloroplast markers that could be very useful, low cost and easy to use for studying genetic diversity and evolutionary history of lupines or Genistoids.The authors thank all institutions for kindly providing seed samples: Institut National d’Agronomie, Alger, Algérie; Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Dijon, France; Western Australian Department of Agriculture, Baron-Hay Court, South Perth, Western Australia; EMBRAPA-CENARGEN, Brasilia, Brasil; United States Department of Agriculture ARS, Washington DC, USA; University of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.The authors also thank M.T.

IntroductionThe woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) was the last surviving species of the mammuthus genus with the last known population on Wrangel Island about 4,000 years ago.1,2 Woolly mammoth is one of the most studied extinct species, although much is still unknown, e.g. why they became extinct, how they evolved, and how they differ from elephants, their closest living relatives. Perhaps the most common theories for the cause of their extinction are a warming climate, hunting by humans, or both. Woolly mammoths lived in a cold, dry steppe-tundra where average winter temperatures ranged from -30°C to -50°C, much different from the tropical and subtropical environments of modern African and Asian elephants.3 Mammoths had many anatomical adaptations minimizing heat loss in its harsh environment, such as thick fur, small ears, and small tails (compared with modern elephants), and a thick layer of fat under the skin to reduce heat loss and possibly serve as a heat source or fat reservoir for the winter.4–6 Mitochondrial analysis has suggested there were three clades (I–III) with clade I surviving ~30,000 years after the extinction of clades II and III despite sharing overlapping territory with clade II in Northeastern Siberia and possibly clade III in Europe.7In 2008, the first whole genome sequencing (WGS) (<1×) of a woolly mammoth was published.8 However, only recently have high coverage WGS datasets become available from two studies that identified SNVs unique to woolly mammoths to infer the genetic basis of adaptations to the Arctic (Lynch study)9 and to analyse species diversity prior to extinction (Palkopoulou study).1 Our combined dataset included mammoths M4 and M25 from the Lynch study, and mammoths Wrangel and Oimyakon from the Palkopoulou study. We used the combined dataset, as well as four Asian elephant WGS datasets,9,10 to analyse structural variants (SVs), copy number variants (CNVs) and indels, as well as SNVs, to further investigate genetic adaptations and diversity. Combining datasets also enabled a comparison of clades, as each study had one clade I (M4, Wrangel) and one clade II (M25, Oimyakon) mammoth. All mammoths remains originated from northern Siberia (M4, ~20,000 years ago; M25, ~60,000 years ago; Oimyakon, ~44,800 years ago) or Wrangel Island, off the coast of northern Siberia (Wrangel, ~4,300 years ago), although the exact location is unknown for M4.1,9,11In this paper, we analysed the patterns of variation across the genomes of these four mammoths and compared them to the available elephant genomes. Using algorithms from our GROM (Genome Rearrangement Omni-Mapper) suite, GROM-RD12 and GROM (in preparation), we systematically identified variants, ranging from single nucleotide changes and short indels to deletions and amplifications of regions encompassing gene fragments and complete genes. These variants reveal the signs of evolutionary adaptation of mammoths to the harsh and cold environment. We identified changes in many parts of the genome, including genes associated with metabolism, circadian rhythms, immunity and skeletal/body shape. Taken together, they describe a rich evolutionary history of the woolly mammoth species and may shed light on causes of their extinction.2. Materials and methods2.1. WGS dataWGS fasta files for woolly mammoths M4 and M25 and Asian Elephants Asha, Parvathy, and Uno were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra (9 February 2017, date last accessed) (project accession number: PRJNA281811). WGS fasta files for the Wrangel and Oimyakon mammoths were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena (9 February 2017, date last accessed) (accession number: ERP008929). WGS fasta files for the Asian elephant Emelia were downloaded from ENA (accession: ERP004241). WGS fasta files were mapped to the African reference genome loxAfr3, downloaded from UCSC (https://genome.ucsc.edu, http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/loxAfr3/bigZips/ (9 February 2017, date last accessed)), using BWA MEM,13 version 0.7.4, with default parameters. Duplicates were removed using SAMtools,14 version 0.1.19.2.2. Variant detection and analysisWe limited analysis to supercontigs/scaffolds =1,000,000 bases. Visual inspection of the mapped files using IGV15 indicated an increase in low mapping quality reads and highly variable coverages for smaller (<1,000,000) supercontigs. For GROM-RD,12 this threshold was set to 5,000,000 bases to provide adequate sampling and increase specificity. GROM-RD identifies regions of abnormal coverage that are unlikely to occur by chance based on analysis of read depth variance with nucleotide composition and mapping quality across the genome. This reduces false positives in potentially biased, highly variable ancient DNA datasets. GROM-RD measures read-depth variance for various window sizes (100–10,000 bases). A benefit of this approach is limiting spikes in false positives with decreasing CNV length. CNVs were detected using GROM-RD with default parameters. Homozygous deletions (GROM-RD copy number estimate <0.5) and duplications (copy number estimate >3.5) found in all woolly mammoths (80% reciprocal CNV overlap) were analysed using GROM-RD and filtered if the GROM-RD copy number estimate was <1.5 (deletions) or >2.5 (duplications) in any of the Asian elephants. Indels and SNVs were detected using our variant calling framework GROM (manuscript in preparation, software will be made publicly available as stipulated by the funding grant). Additionally, GROM-RD calls were filtered if CNVnator (run with default parameters) detected the CNV in any Asian elephant (20% reciprocal overlap) or did not detect the CNV in all mammoths (50% reciprocal overlap). A simplified SNV/indel caller module in GROM was implemented to replicate, with a few differences, the SNV detection method used in a previous mammoth study.9 Indels and SNVs predicted as being heterozygous (<80%, indels, or <90%, SNVs, of overlapping reads contained the variant) or supported by <4 reads with mapping quality = 20 in any of the mammoths, or with at least one variant-supporting read (no mapping quality threshold) in any of the Asian elephants were filtered. We also required each Asian elephant to have at least 4× coverage at the indel or SNV site predicted in mammoth. These requirements were reciprocated when calling elephant-specific variants. Fixed, derived CNVs, indels, and SNVs were then uploaded to VEP (Variant Effect Predictor, www.ensembl.org) to identify variants potentially affecting genes. GO term and KO phenotypes obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium (geneontology.org), and MGI (www.informatics.jax.org). GO term, KEGG pathway, and KO phenotype enrichment for woolly mammoth fixed, derived amino acid substitutions was analysed using PANTHER (http://pantherdb.org/ (9 February 2017, date last accessed)),16 WebGestalt (http://www.webgestalt.org/ (9 February 2017, date last accessed)),17 and Vlad (http://proto.informatics.jax.org/prototypes/vlad/ (9 February 2017, date last accessed)), respectively. Using a set of SNVs (four variant-supporting reads, mapping quality =20, allele frequency =0.4) found in at least one mammoth or Asian elephant, FST estimates were calculated, as described in a prior publication,18 with VCFtools,19 version 0.1.12, using the –weir-fst-pop function with a 100,000 base window size (–fst-window-size) and 10,000 base sliding window (–fst-window-step). Protein multiple sequence alignments produced using T-Coffee20 for protein sequences shorter than the recommend limit of 2,500 amino acids or MUSCLE21 for longer protein sequences.3. Results3.1. CNVsAs noted in Lynch et al.,9 mammoths and Asian elephants diverged after branching from African elephants (reference genome), thus fixed CNVs in mammoths are considered derived. Using an intersection of GROM-RD12 and CNVnator22 calls, we found 56 fixed, derived mammoth CNVs, including 55 deletions and one amplification. According to VEP (ensembl.org), three deletions with putative loss of function and one amplification with potential gain of function occurred in the exons of protein-coding genes, and two deletions affected RNA genes (Table 1). Fixed, derived woolly mammoth CNVsEnsembl gene ID used when gene symbol not available.Fixed, derived woolly mammoth CNVsEnsembl gene ID used when gene symbol not available.Perhaps the most famous CNV in the elephant genome is the TP53 gene.23 However, analysis with GROM-RD and visual inspection with IGV15 did not reveal any copy number change relative to elephants in the corresponding genome regions of woolly mammoths.One deletion occurred in an exon of CD44. The CD44 gene is expressed in multiple tissues including the central nervous system, lung, epidermis, liver, and pancreas.24 Its product is involved in multiple functions, including cellular adhesion, hyaluronate degradation, lymphocyte activation, lymph node homing, angiogenesis, and the release of cytokines.24 CD44 contributes to the maintenance of stem cell features, such as apoptosis resistance.25 Intriguingly, the deleted exon is the first of the ten so-called variable exons of CD44, whose splicing and histone mark deposition has been shown to be modulated by Argonaute proteins and strongly affected in Ago2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts,26 thus its loss may affect the functionality and tissue distribution of CD44 isoforms. Among a multitude of CD44 GO terms and knockout (KO) mammalian phenotypes listed in Supplementary Table S1, there are two phenotypes of special interest to woolly mammoths, increased diameter of the tibia and short tibia. Mammoth limb bones were much greater in diameter than the limb bones of modern day elephants.27 Additionally, the hind leg to fore leg ratio was smaller in mammoths compared with elephants,27 with their body size and stature decreasing towards the end of the last glacial advance in the Pleistocene.27 On the basis of a small sample, the tibia to femur ratio of mammoths (0.57 ± 0.04, n = 5) was less than the tibia to femur ratio of African elephants (0.60 ± 0.02, n = 5).27One may argue that deletions detected with an alignment of reads against an evolutionary distant reference may represent false positives arising due to rapid evolution and low sequence similarity in the respective regions. Even if that was true, this argument does not change the relevance of our logic on the possible effects on the exon of CD44, since any significant sequence alteration would also modify the function of the region in woolly mammoths, compared with African and Asian elephants. Further, the large sizes of the detected deletions (Table 1) suggest extreme changes, not seen in other genes. Other deletions were observed outside of the coding regions and are thus also outside the scope of the study and do not affect our conclusions.We detected a fixed, derived woolly mammoth amplification encompassing the RNase L gene (scaffold_16:17939571-17966869, forward strand), including ~20,000 bases upstream. GROM-RD predicted five (Wrangel, Oimyakon), six (M25), or nine (M4) copies of RNase L (6.6 copies, stdev 0.8) in the mammoths. Figure 1 shows normalized coverages and the location of RNase L within the CNV. RNase L has several critical roles including antiviral response, adipocyte differentiation, tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, innate immune response, and apoptosis.28 Antiviral response involves endonucleolytic cleavage of single-stranded foreign RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and mRNAs by activated RNase L.28–30RNase L amplification unique to woolly mammoths.

Bottom four tracks show Asian elephants (Emelia, Asha, Parvathy, Uno). Box indicates region containing RNase L exons.Additionally, we identified nine derived SNVs predicted to occur in 3–9 of the RNase L copies and with no evidence in any of the Asian elephant samples. Six of these were non-synonymous (Table 2) and may reflect adaptation in woolly mammoths. We used T-Coffee20 to align the RNase L protein sequence for mammoth with the protein sequence of 16 other species, including human, mouse, and cold-adapted species polar bear, alpine marmot, and walrus (Supplementary Fig. S1). A more concise alignment of human and African elephant RNase L protein sequence is shown in Fig. 2. Substitution S34I is adjacent to residue G35 (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is involved in 2–5A interaction,31 needed for dimerization of RNase L and activation of its antiviral activity. V34 was most prevalent with S34 occurring in African and Asian elephants, T34 in dolphin, and I34 in mammoth, Alpine marmot, and platypus. T322A is close to several residues involved in self-domain dimerization (Y310, S312, R316, and L319)31 and 2-5A sensing (Y308, Y310).32 V322 was predominant with I322 occurring in Anole lizard, T322 in African and Asian elephants, and A322 in mammoth, cow, sheep, armadillo, dolphin, and platypus. Of interest, woolly mammoth substitution R675K was identified as a ribonuclease active site in pigs by Huang et al.,31 who has shown that mutant pK672A (mammoth 675) results in a defective RNase L. In this position, K occurs in all of the aligned species except African and Asian elephants, which have R, and in a previous alignment by Huang, R occurs in chicken.31 Both R and K occur in the mammoth. Together with the significant amplification of the locus in the mammoth genomes, these variants likely reflect adaptation processes related to RNase L functionality and specificity.

RNases L cleavage site H683 (hH672) is marked with a plus sign (+).RNase L is able to selectively target specific cellular RNA28 and is involved in antiviral activity against numerous virus families.33 RNase L activation in virus-infected cells was shown to trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome,34 the latter being implicated in the host response to many different types of RNA and DNA viruses, including herpesviridae.35 Notably, elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses (EEHV) can cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants: two available genomes of Asian elephants were obtained postmortem from the animals affected by this disease.10 The EEHV genotypes found in African elephants appear to be generally less virulent.36Arctic conditions may be of additional significance with regard to the antiviral action of this protein. Temperature-dependent transmission of rotavirus (family Reoviridae) has been shown in humans, with a 13 percent decrease in infections per 1°C increase in temperature above 5°C.37 In river water in Japan, the peak reovirus level was found in winter during the cold weather months.38 Influenza virus was found to favor cold and dry conditions for transmission in guinea pigs.39 Macaques infected with SRV-4, family Retroviridae, had less SRV-4 antibodies in cold weather.40 Mammoths lived in cold dry steppe tundra, and likely in close matriarch-led groups similar to modern elephants, possibly increasing pressure for the species to evolve defenses against viruses adapted to their environment. Not surprisingly, RNase L KO mammalian phenotypes included increased susceptibility to viral infection, as well as abnormal thymus morphology, enlarged thymus, and thymus hyperplasia (Supplementary Table S1).Given the close arrangement of the SNVs near the ribonuclease active site, we further analysed their co-occurrence in the individual reads (Fig. 3). For all mammoths, non-synonymous A allele (R675K, aGg/aAg, scaffold 16:17,965,935) always co-occurred with synonymous A allele (H683, scaffold_16:17,965,951) for reads containing both nucleotide locations (Fig. 3). The patterns of co-occurrence of the non-synonymous C allele (K688N, scaffold_16:17,965,975) with the A alleles at 17,965,935 and 17,965,951 appeared to be linked with the clade structure. The nine RNase L copies of M4 showed almost equal occurrence of GGG (same as the African elephant reference) or AAC (all three nucleotides substituted compared with the reference) haplotypes at these three positions. Another clade I member, Wrangel, showed prevalence of AAC and GGC in the reads containing the three SNV locations, while GGC haplotype was strongly preferred in the clade II genomes.

SNVsWe found 836,806 (606,176 intergenic; 224,483 intronic; 6,147 exonic) fixed, derived woolly mammoth SNVs, including 2,283 fixed, derived amino acid substitutions in 1,888 protein-coding genes, four protein-coding genes with a start loss and 18 protein-coding genes with pre-mature stop codons (Supplementary Material S1). We note that Lynch et al.9 has used similar criteria (see Materials and methods) to find a higher total of fixed, derived woolly mammoth SNVs (1.4 million compared with 0.8 million). This was expected considering our study had more samples (four woolly mammoths, four Asian elephants) compared with the Lynch study (two woolly mammoths, three Asian elephants), likely decreasing false positives. However, Lynch et al. had fewer fixed, derived woolly mammoth amino acid substitutions (2,020 compared with 2,283). Several factors may have contributed to the discrepancy. For instance, we did not hard-mask potential cytosine deamination sites or filter short reads, and instead used a higher mapping quality threshold (>20) compared with Lynch et al.’s threshold (>0). Ancient DNA is known to have miscodings of C to T and G to A.41 However, Briggs et al.41 has suggested that with sufficient coverage nucleotide misincorporations should not prevent a reliable Neandertal or mammoth genome sequence from being determined. We reasoned that our potentially less stringent thresholds (to increase sensitivity) would be adequate considering we analysed four mammoth samples, each with =10× coverage, and filtered SNVs using four Asian elephants (see Supplementary Table S2 for coverages). We tested for ancient DNA biases by comparing fixed, non-synonymous variants in woolly mammoths (2,283), Asian elephants (2,634), and the Lynch study woolly mammoths (2,020). We found that rates (as a fraction of all substitutions) for fixed, non-synonymous variants in the mammoths were similar for substitutions corresponding to the most common potential miscodings, C <U+2192> T (0.216, present study; 0.211, Lynch study) and G <U+2192> A (0.227, present study; 0.209, Lynch study) (Table 3), and thus our variant collection was unlikely to have been biased by these miscodings compared with the variants in the Lynch study. The rates in mammoths were only moderately higher than those in Asian elephants (Table 3).

Additionally, we were interested in identifying genes under positive selection. Given our limited sample population, we identified genes with maximum FST values (top 5%).42 We found 544 of 2,283 (24%) mammoth substitutions, affecting 446 of 1,888 (24%) protein-coding genes, were in the top 5% of FST values (Supplementary Material S1). Rather than repeat previous observations by Lynch et al. (which we also detected), we report a few interesting findings from our analysis, expanding the list of likely selected variants fixed across the mammoth genomes.We found three fixed, derived non-synonymous woolly mammoth variants (R381K, A424V, I2640V) in APOB (0.99 FST rank). Multiple alignment, using MUSCLE,21 of the APOB protein sequence for mammoth and 15 other species indicated the V substitution at mammoth residue position 424 was shared with the cold-adapted walrus, the cold-blooded Anole lizard, and platypus (Supplementary Fig. S2). Residue I was pre-dominant at mammoth residue position 2,640 except for a V substitution in mammoth, the cold-adapted Alpine marmot, and the cold-blooded Anole lizard. APOB codes an apolipoprotein for chylomicrons and LDL particles. High levels of the APOB protein have been linked to atherosclerotic plaques.43 In a comparison of polar bears and brown bears, a recent study44 noted nine non-synonymous APOB mutations in polar bears and suggested that a carnivorous diet of pre-dominantly fatty acids induced adaptive changes in APOB. Mammoths likely had a plant-based diet similar to modern elephants.45 Lower ApoB/ApoA1 plasma levels have been noted in cold-adapted human swimmers.46 In carp, cold adaptation included up-regulation of six apolipoprotein genes including APOB.47 We also found three non-synonymous variants in TRPM8, a protein that was briefly noted in Lynch et al. and is responsible for sensitivity to noxious cold. TRPM8 transmembrane domain S2 influences menthol binding and mutation Y745H (mouse) results in a loss of sensitivity to menthol.48 In mammoth, mutations were R368H (h364), G710S (h706), and C711S (h707). On the basis of multiple protein sequence alignment, using T-Coffee, with 16 other organisms, mammoth was the only organism with a substitution of the consensus amino acid at these locations (Supplementary Fig. S3). G710S and C711S occur in S1 (residues 697–716).Modifications to genes responsible for circadian rhythms have also been identified uniquely in the woolly mammoth. As previously reported by Lynch et al.,9 woolly mammoth had a fixed, non-synonymous variant in PER2. We also found previously unreported fixed, non-synonymous woolly mammoth variants in several important clock genes: ARNTL (BMAL1) of 0.25 FST rank, CRTC1 (1.0 FST rank), KDM5A (0.86 FST rank), and KMT2A (1.0 FST rank). The ARNTL gene is of particular importance as a core circadian oscillator in mammals. ARNTL controls not only the innate 24-h cycle of the organism, but also the transcription of several circadian dependent genes. BMAL1 KO mice have been shown to lose core circadian control, and therefore become arrhythmic.49 Although loss of control may not be beneficial, a weakening of this core oscillator could potentially aid the mammoth in adjusting its behaviour and compensating for the large differences of daylight experienced in summer compared with winter. Another important molecular component of the circadian clock, CRTC1, has a substitution identified in woolly mammoths. This protein is an important member of the signaling pathway for light response and setting the circadian clock of an organism.50 Alterations of this gene can possibly help to force the innate 24-h cycle of an organisms to adapt to the continually variable light–dark cycle of its environment.50 This may have enabled the mammoth to more easily entrain to light and elicit a varied wake response throughout the changing seasons. KDM5A acts on the transcription of the BMAL1/CLOCK complex and works to dampen circadian oscillators.51 KMT2A also plays an essential role in altering the chromatin state of circadian controlled genes.52 These adaptations are possibly due to the increased latitude that woolly mammoths inhabited, forcing a more flexible circadian clock as seasonal changes introduced an extremely varied cycle of light and darkness through the course of the year. Another highly mutated gene was NCKAP5 (0.98 FST rank). The function of NCKAP5 is unknown, but SNPs in NCKAP5 have been linked to hypersomnia.53KEGG analysis indicated enrichment of ‘pathways in cancer’ (P = 9.6 × 10-5, adjP = 0.0021), which lead us to investigate several cancer-related genes that had multiple non-synonymous variants. BRCA1 (0.98 FST rank), BRCA2 (0.52 FST rank), and PARP14 (0.84 FST rank) had three, seven, and seven non-synonymous variants, respectively. Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 have vital functions, rapid evolution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 has been observed in mammals.54 Citing that ‘nearly all known cases of recurrent positive selection in primate genomes involve genes in one of three categories: (i) immunity, (ii) environmental perception (such as odorant and taste receptors), or (iii) sexual selection and mate choice’,54–56 Lou et al. proposed that rapid BRCA1 and BRCA2 evolution is due to adaptation to viruses. A recent study hypothesized that PARP14 is involved in host–virus defense due to the gene’s strong positive selection in primates.57 This may also explain the high number of fixed, derived woolly mammoth non-synonymous variants we found in PARP14, also involved in DNA repair. Although speculative, possible changes in the repair pathways in mammoth genomes in response to viruses might lend further support to our observation of active development of antiviral mechanisms via amplification of RNase L.We also investigated the 18 genes with pre-mature stop codons, eight having gene symbols. Genes with pre-mature stop codons had mutations associated with ancient DNA bias (C <U+2192> T, G <U+2192> A) in 14 of 18 (78%) cases, considerably higher than the rate observed in Asian elephants (36%). However, one gene with a stop gain, ABCC11 (1.0 FST rank), had four non-synonymous variants, of which two occurred downstream of the stop gain, W703* (Table 4). ABCC11 has been shown to determine wet or dry ear wax58 in humans, and the ear wax single nucleotide polymorphism, rs17822931-G/A (G180R), was shown to be absent in Africans and increase in prevalence with absolute latitude.59 Ohashi et al. also indicated that rs17822931-A resulted in loss of function. ABCC11 also has roles involving bile acids, conjugated steroids, and cyclic nucleotides.60,61Fixed, derived non-synonymous woolly mammoth variants in ABCC11Fixed, derived non-synonymous woolly mammoth variants in ABCC11Mitochondrial phylogenetic analysis has suggested two primary clades of woolly mammoth, clades I and II, that are thought to have evolved in isolation on opposite sides of the Bering Strait.7 Our dataset contained two mammoths from each major clade, clade I (Wrangel and M4) and clade II (Oimyakon and M25). Clade II disappeared ~30,000–40,000 years prior to the extinction of clade I. We investigated the differences between the genomes of clades I and II and found four fixed, derived clade I CNVs, three deletions and one duplication, none of which occurred in exonic regions. Similarly, there were two fixed, derived clade II CNVs, both duplications, but neither occurred in exons. We found 57 fixed, derived clade I indels (11 insertions and 46 deletions), and 65 fixed, derived clade II indels (24 insertions and 41 deletions), none of which occurred in exons. For SNVs, we found 1,215 fixed, derived clade I variants, of which 279 and five occurred in introns and exons, respectively. Four were non-synonymous variants in protein-coding genes (Table 5). Clade II had 584 fixed SNVs, 125 and three occurred in introns and exons, respectively. Two non-synonymous clade II variants occurred in protein-coding genes (Table 5). Fixed, derived non-synonymous clade variantsNon-synonymous clade variants were homozygous in the clade and had no evidence of the variant in the Asian elephants or the other clade.

Ensembl gene ID used when gene symbol not available.Clade I genes with fixed, derived amino acid substitutions included ZDHHC23, SULT6B1, and SPTBN5. Of most interest, SULT6B1 is a sulfotransferase that utilizes 3-phospho-5-adenylyl sulphate (PAPS) to catalyze the sulphate conjugation of thyroxine and is involved in the metabolism of thyroxine.62 Unlike other SULTs, SULT6B1 is uniquely specific for thyroxine, suggesting a role in regulation of thyroxine.62 Thyroxine (T4) is a thyroid hormone involved in growth, development, differentiation, and basal metabolic homeostasis, as well as the regulation of protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism.63–65 Also, it is involved in facultative thermogenesis (heat production in response to cold or overeating).66 Administering thyroid hormones results in a severe drop in body temperature.67Clade II had a fixed, derived amino acid substitution in CCDC94. CCDC94 knockdown in zebrafish increased sensitivity of ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and CCDC94 protects cells from ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis by repressing expression of p53 mRNA.68GO terms and KO mammalian phenotypes for genes with fixed, derived non-synonymous clade I and II variants are summarized in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively. Interestingly, fixed, derived non-synonymous clade I variant ZDHHC23 and clade II variant CCDC94 had KO phenotypes ‘increased caudal vertebrae number’ and ‘decreased caudal vertebrae number’, respectively. At the time of writing, it was unknown to us if clade I and clade II differed in their number of tail bones. The caudal vertebrae number of woolly mammoths has been estimated to be 21 but has not been ‘confidently established’27 as few complete skeletons have been found. Modern elephants have 28–33 caudal bones.27 Woolly mammoth shorter tail adaptation likely reduced heat loss and frostbite.693.3. IndelsWe found 20,576 fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels, 2,413 insertions and 18,163 deletions. Of these, 597 insertion indels and 5,174 deletion indels overlapped introns. Exons were found to harbor four insertion and 16 deletion indels (Table 6). All fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels were <3 bases in length resulting in frameshifts and were classified as high impact variants by VEP (ensembl.org). A number of protein-coding gene regions disrupted by an indel showed interesting functions, potentially relevant to woolly mammoth adaptation. Supplementary Table S5 lists GO terms and KO phenotypes for fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels affecting exonic regions. WWC1 functions as a tumor suppressor regulating Hippo signaling70,71 and has GO term ‘negative regulation of organ growth’. In agreement with SNV analysis in the present study and by Lynch et al.,9 we found an abundance of fixed, derived woolly mammoth variants in genes involved with lipid metabolism, possibly an adaptation for storing fat (e.g., ETNK1, lipid metabolic process).

Additionally, the knockdown of GPR38 promoted a decrease in core body temperature during the daily activity period.74 Increases in weight gain and lower core body temperatures have shown to be advantageous to mice when presented with lower ambient environmental temperatures. Mice that had developed these traits were shown to have a stable metabolic rate and more easily maintained core body temperatures in ambient cold temperatures compared with their wild-type counterparts.75 These studies suggest a possible role for modification or loss-of-function of GPR83 transcripts in the survival of mammoths considering the harsh environment of their habitat.Another affected gene, RALGPS2, had one mammalian KO phenotype, ‘increased rib number’. In mammals, the number of cervical vertebrae is highly conserved at seven. Approximately 90 percent of humans with a cervical rib die before reaching reproductive age,76 due to a strong association with multiple major congenital abnormalities. However, a recent study77 found abnormal cervical rib numbers in Late Pleistocene mammoths (33%), a rate 10 times higher than in extant elephants (3.6%), which appears consistent with our finding. The abnormal numbers were due to large cervical ribs on the seventh vertebra and mammoth cervical ribs were relatively large compared with cervical ribs in humans.77Several genes with fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels had mammalian KO phenotypes related to decreased body size: decreased birth body size (GPR83), decreased body length (ARHGEF28), and decreased body weight (NOL8), and as noted earlier, CD44 KO was linked to short tibias. Towards the end of their existence mammoths decreased in size.27 All samples in this study were near the end of the mammoths existence, from 60,000 years ago or more recent. The cause of the extinction of woolly mammoths is unknown but is often regarded to be due to a warming climate and hunting by humans. We note that several genes with fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels had detrimental reproductive KO phenotypes, such as NOL8 (pre-weaning lethality), SBNO2 (pre-weaning lethality), and PAX2 (postnatal lethality and perinatal lethality). ARHGEF28 had the mammalian KO phenotype ‘reproductive system’. Additionally, we found that all genes with fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels (and with a gene symbol) occurred in one or more recent screens of gene essentiality (Table 7). Essentiality of genes with fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels occurring in protein-coding regionsGenes without symbols (seven) were excluded. a, Wang et al.82; b, Hart et al.83; c, Blomen et al.84Essentiality of genes with fixed, derived woolly mammoth indels occurring in protein-coding regionsGenes without symbols (seven) were excluded. a, Wang et al.82; b, Hart et al.83; c, Blomen et al.844. DiscussionWe performed systematic detection of variants, ranging from single nucleotide changes and short indels to deletions and amplifications of regions encompassing gene fragments and complete genes in four woolly mammoth genomes, comparing them to the elephant genomes. Extending the findings of previous SNV-only analyses, we found many unique woolly mammoth genetic variants involved in processes relevant to living in a harsh, cold environment, such as lipid metabolism and thermogenesis. We also observed changes in the core circadian oscillator genes that may have occurred as woolly mammoths adapted to the extremely varied cycle of light and darkness through the course of the year in the Arctic. Further, we noticed many immunity-related variants, most strikingly the copy number amplification of RNase L, important in antiviral response. Immunity tends to evolve rapidly and woolly mammoth genomes display signs of adaptation to the differences in environmental threats they faced compared with their tropical/subtropical elephant counterparts. The haplotype patterns in RNase L gene described above show similarities in clade II but differences in clade I, likely reflecting the history of development of multiple defense mechanisms, which appear to be absent (or reduced) in the modern elephants. Do multiple RNase L paralogs and multiple non-synonymous changes in the repair pathways indicate that mammoths faced much deadlier viral threats? Were those threats further exacerbated by the cold Arctic conditions? Was this possibly linked to the ultimate demise of mammoths?African elephants have been shown to have at least 20 copies of the tumor suppressor TP53, possibly explaining their low cancer mortality despite their large size and long life span.23 Such TP53 locus amplification is also present in woolly mammoth genomes making RNase L their second largest CNV. It is worth noting that RNase L may also play a role in tumor suppression78 and has been linked to prostate cancer.79Recently, other avenues of analysis of ancient DNA have been proposed, related to CpG methylation and corresponding epigenetic patterns (as summarized in a recent review80). Sampling based on methylated binding domains (MBD) has been performed in a number of organisms, including two other woolly mammoths.81 We analysed these MDB mammoth samples but found the genome coverage to be too fragmentary (as estimated by total SNP counts from all MDB- and MBD+ samples <0.3% of SNPs in a typical mammoth genome and by nearly negligible overlap with a union of SNPs from our study) to draw any meaningful conclusions.And as for the differences between clades I and II, although only a few are reported here, some variants may represent continuing evolution of adaptations to a cold environment. Fixed non-synonymous variants in clade I (ZDHHC23) and clade II (CCDC94) have been shown to affect the number of tail bones and clade I non-synonymous variant SULT6B1 plays a role in thyroid hormone regulation. Since clade II disappeared during the last glacial period prior to rising temperatures, these variants might have contributed to the longer survival of clade I mammoths.Taken together, these observations point to a rich population history of these iconic animals extending beyond the description based on three clades.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES Online.This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (award DBI-1458202 to A.G.).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionIn recent years, with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT sequencing), the cost per megabase (Mb; a million bases) has been decreasing.1 In particular, transcriptomic sequencing has advanced the study of gene regulatory pathways in non-model organisms. In general, assembly, annotation, gene expression calculation and systematic function analysis are the four major processes after transcriptome sequencing has been finished by biotech companies. At the step of assembly, the raw reads with low quality were removed before assembling to transcripts (contigs). Numerous software for sequencing assembly have been developed such as Trinity,2 Oases,3 SOAPdenovo-Trans,4 Trans-Abyss5 and Bridger.6 A Linux environment is required for all of these tools. After transcripts have been assembled, the annotation is critical to define their potential function. Several tools could be applied for annotation, such as Blast2GO,7 BLAST,8 Trinotate,2 MAPLE9 and TRAPID.10 As well as, many database can be utilized to annotate the transcripts with regard to NCBI non-redundancy proteins (NCBI NR), UniProt Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL,11 Gene Ontology (GO)12 and KEGG pathways.13 Following the annotation, it is important to identify the differentially expressed transcripts when comparing different samples. Therefore, the expression value of each transcript (contig) were calculated and normalized by RPKM (reads per million per kilo base), FPKM (fragments per million per kilo base) and TPM (transcript per million) depends on sequencing methods (i.e. single end reads or paired end reads).Finally, systematic function analysis is the most important, but trouble issue for biologists. A useful bioinformatics resource is crucial to retrieve valuable information and experimental candidates from numerous transcripts. Recently, several open source software packages (e.g. Bioconductor (based on R script)14 and Graphical User Interface (GUI)) and commercial software (e.g. Ingenuity IPA, CLC Workbench) have been developed for functional analysis of high-throughput transcriptomic data. However, the use of commercial software might be restricted by research budgets, while open source software might be difficult for biologists to use if they do not have a programming background. Although R script is very powerful to analyze various biological data, a series courses of R language is needed before using those open resource. For some biologists, this might be a slow remedy that cannot meet an urgency. Consequently, the processing of these huge sequencing data usually becomes a bottleneck for biologists, due to the requirement of the efficient hardware and ability of programming language.A database named EXPath15 was developed by our group, which contains the experimental microarray data of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays, and provides comparative expression analysis inferring metabolic pathways. It is very useful with regard to dissecting the collected microarray datasets in terms of the pathways, differential expression, co-expression and pathway/GO enrichment analysis. Unfortunately, such a valuable database cannot be used for other high-throughput expression data, and at present, the system is limited to the datasets collected in the EXPath database. In order to provide more diverse transcriptome data, EXPath Tool is developed in this work to comprehensively analyze users’ transcriptome datasets. Several analysis functions were not only advanced but also added in EXPath Tool. The online interface of EXPath Tool is especially designed for biologists, and after uploading an annotation and expression profile, five main functions (Gene Search, Pathway Search, DEGs Search, Pathways/GO Enrichment and Co-expression analysis) are provided for users to dissect their data from multiple perspectives. The concept and construction of EXPath Tool is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data preprocessDue to the heavy server loading of sequence assembly, annotation and calculation of transcript expression values, several data preprocess should be finished by users before upload their data to the EXPath Tool. Usually, these processes are a part of service of sequencing company. However, the step-by-step processing flow and required tools for data preprocess were also suggested in our system. Additionally, numerous protein sequences from NCBI RefSeq and UniprotKB for the annotation of different organisms are provided in EXPath Tool. After data preprocess, the files of annotation and expression profiles could be uploaded for further analysis in the EXPath Tool. The system flow of data preprocess is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. It briefly describes the analysis steps for sequence assembly, annotation and expression data calculation. The details about the utility of those tools and requirements are provided in the guide page of the EXPath Tool (http://expathtool.itps.ncku.edu.tw/guide_for_custom/guide/create_project_preprocess.php).2.2. Processing of uploaded dataset in the EXPath ToolAfter users create a personal account, they can login into the EXPath Tool system and upload a set of annotation and expression profiles (call a ‘Project’). In the EXPath Tool system, the annotation files of the pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) are required, as well as the gene (transcript) expression data. More additional annotations from other databases, such as Pfam16 and PANTHER17 are encouraged. After examination of the format of the uploaded files, all data are processed individually. Figure 1 illustrates the data processing flow of uploaded files. For the expression profiles, the samples are grouped into conditions by the column name and the average expression values of each gene (transcript) under each condition are calculated. The calculation results are applied for the function of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) search (DEGs search) and co-expression analysis. For the annotation files of the pathways, if there is no assigned KEGG ortholog (KO) ID, the system automatically converts the annotated ID (i.e. NCBI GI, NCBI RefSeq, UniprotKB accession number etc.) to KO ID using the UniProt ID mapping table. The KO ID could be used to connect the KEGG pathway map, and also applied to gene annotation, pathway searches and pathway enrichment analysis. Finally, the GO term file is applied to gene annotation and GO enrichment analysis.

Algorithm and constructionA pathway describes a series links of chemical reactions. Several critical pathways are affected by environmental changes due to various expression values of numerous genes (transcripts) under different conditions. In ‘Pathway Search’, after setting a specific pathway and the conditions of interest, the annotated pathway map will be displayed (Fig. 2a). In addition, the annotation and expression level of the KEGG ortholog can be accessed by clicking the KEGG ortholog block (Fig. 2b). The expression of the KEGG ortholog is calculated by simply averaging the expression levels of the associated genes in each condition. Furthermore, the absolute and relative expression values of various transcripts of the KEGG ortholog are graphically illustrated (Fig. 2c and d). The web interface of pathway search result. (a) The genes annotated with the KEGG enzyme, the KEGG enzyme block is filled with green rectangle. A user selected gene is marked with red rectangle. The average (b), absolute (c) and relative (d) expression level of KEGG orthologs (including every transcripts) will be displayed when user clicks the green rectangle in figure (a).The web interface of pathway search result.

The average (b), absolute (c) and relative (d) expression level of KEGG orthologs (including every transcripts) will be displayed when user clicks the green rectangle in figure (a).To determine genes that are differentially expressed under distinct conditions, the t-test statistical method was applied by using function t.test() of the R package in EXPath Tool. Users can specify the treatment and control, set the cut-off values of fold change and P value, and the DEGs results will then be determined.Co-expressed genes are a group of genes with similar expression profiles under specific conditions. Theoretically, they may be controlled by specific transcription factors and involved in identical pathways. To determine a group of genes which are co-expressed, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Spearman’s rank methods are applied by using function cor() of the R package in EXPath Tool. There are two analysis modes in the co-expression analysis:(A) Correlation of a single gene(B) Correlation networkThis function is identifying the correlation network of a group of query genes. The algorithm of the correlation coefficient and cut-off value should be set first. The correlation networks are constructed by Cytoscape Web18 based on the setting parameters (Supplementary Fig. S4).N and M denote the number of background genes and total genes involved in specific KEGG pathways or GO terms, respectively. i is the number of input genes (defined as n) which belong to those KEGG pathways or GO terms. An example of the results is presented in Supplementary Fig. S5 in the Supplementary data.After logging into EXPath Tool, users can import their data via ‘Create New Project’, and all information can be modified via project management. In order to carry out different sets of experiments, numerous projects are allowed in EXPath Tool. After finishing all the requirements for the system, the functions of Gene Search, Pathway Search, DEGs Search, Pathways/GO Enrichment and Co-expression analysis can be carried out by clicking ‘ENTER PROJECT’. It is easy to access differentially expressed genes (transcripts), critical pathways, and coexpression networks under a specific treatment by using EXPath Tool. The detailed introduction and guidelines for each function can be retrieved from the main page.3. Results and discussion3.1. A case study: co-expression analysis of IAA-responsive genesEXPath tool provides a platform to assess co-expressions among a set of genes or transcripts by using users’ expression data. EXPath tool offers not only the visualization of correlation networks but also the enriched GO/Pathway of co-expressed genes. The following case study demonstrates the application of EXPath tool.As is well known, auxins are important plant hormones involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as hypocotyl elongation, organ development and gravitropism. Nemhauser et al.19 revealed that 51 Arabidopsis genes were vital IAA-responsive genes by using Affymetrix GeneChips as gene expression measurement (Supplementary Table S1). Among these genes, 49 genes showed significant up-regulation under IAA treatments. The other two genes (AT1G72430 and AT4G00880) were down-regulated. All genes were related to signaling and transcription. There is a series of microarray expression data (GSE39384) retrieved from AtGeneExpress were uploaded to demonstrate the usage of EXPath Tool.20 The samples included three time points of IAA and mock treatment. First, 51 genes were utilized to construct correlation networks. Figure 3 demonstrates that AT1G72430 and AT4G00880 were identified the negative co-expressions (marked in green), which consisted with the expression profile in the previous study. Moreover, two IAA genes, AT1G15580 (IAA5) and AT3G23030 (IAA2) showed the highest connection with other IAA-responsive genes. Afterwards, all these genes were sent to the pathways/GO enrichment analysis. As expected, the most significant pathways and GO terms were plant hormone signal transduction, response to auxin, and auxin-activated signaling pathway (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). This case described above reveals that EXPath Tool is an effective webserver for users to explore an important regulatory mechanism from their own high-throughput transcriptome data. The correlation networks of IAA-responsive genes. Two down-regulated genes (AT1G72430 and AT4G00880) show the negative co-expressions with other genes.The correlation networks of IAA-responsive genes. Two down-regulated genes (AT1G72430 and AT4G00880) show the negative co-expressions with other genes.3.2.The utility and significance of EXPath ToolThere are several useful webservers or software packages that have been developed to help biologists to systematically analyze their high-throughput transcriptome data. Supplementary Table S4 compares the EXPath Tool and other similar resources. BioWardrob21 and T-REx22 conduct differentially expressed analysis and co-expression analysis according to the expression levels of genes. BioWardrob can conduct additional analyses (i.e., enrichment analysis) by executing R-scripts. However, code-editing is required for this, and R-script is usually difficult for a biologist with only wet lab experience. S-MART23 focuses on the detection of alternative splicing and transcript isoforms, and differentially expressed genes also can be identified. Although FunRich,24 GeneProf and Microscope can conduct GO enrichment analysis, differential expression analysis and network construction, visual pathway and co-expression analysis are unavailable in these systems. Degust not only displays the normalized expression level of each condition, but also combines the expression level and KEGG pathway map.25 Unfortunately, Degust is only supplied for RNA-seq data. Additionally, wapRNA is a good tool to analyze GO terms and KEGG pathways of the DEGs.26 However, the significance of GO and pathways could not be easily identified in the output results, neither can the number of related transcripts. Nevertheless, all of the tools mentioned above are useful for bioinformatics scientists, while some are inefficient for biologists. EXPath Tool is constructed especially for biologists, and the web interface is very user-friendly and effective. Comprehensive analysis functions for transcriptome data (including microarray and RNA-seq) such as Gene Search, Pathway Search, DEGs Search, Pathways/GO Enrichment and Co-expression analysis are freely provided. It is thus easy to identify critical candidate genes/pathways for further experiments.

Despite their ubiquity, repetitive DNAs are poorly studied when compared with the genic fraction of genomes. Here, we took advantage of the availability of the sequenced genome of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus to assess its satellite DNAs (satDNAs) and their distribution in Callitrichini. After clustering analysis of all reads and comparisons by similarity, we identified a satDNA composed by 171 bp motifs, named MarmoSAT, which composes 1.09% of the C. jacchus genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization on chromosomes of species from the genera Callithrix, Mico and Callimico showed that MarmoSAT had a subtelomeric location. In addition to the common monomeric, we found that MarmoSAT was also organized in higher-order repeats of 338 bp in Callimico goeldii. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that MarmoSAT repeats from C. jacchus lack chromosome-specific features, suggesting exchange events among subterminal regions of non-homologous chromosomes. MarmoSAT is transcribed in several tissues of C. jacchus, with the highest transcription levels in spleen, thymus and heart. The transcription profile and subtelomeric location suggest that MarmoSAT may be involved in the regulation of telomerase and modulation of telomeric chromatin.1. IntroductionNew World monkeys (NWM), infraorder Platyrrhini, represent a diverse group of neotropical primates, which are very important in medical, genomics, and evolutionary studies. Among them, the marmosets (tribe Callitrichini, family Cebidae) comprise a group of 21 species of Callithrix, endemic in the Atlantic forest, while Cebuella and Mico are found in the Amazon rainforest.1 Recent molecular data support a strong relationship between Callithrix and Cebuella + Mico, which are, in turn, sister groups to Callimico.2,3 In addition to the geographical separation, marmosets have different diploid numbers (2n). Callithrix species have 2n = 46, whereas both Cebuella and Mico species have 2n = 44.4Several studies have shown that NWM genomes are rich in repetitive DNAs, most still uncharacterized. Among them, dispersed repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (TEs), are major components of primate genomes.5 For instance, the long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1) and the primate-specific Alu element, a short interspersed element (SINE), were considered as the largest contributors to the genome expansion in primates.6Satellite DNA (satDNA) sequences, which are organized as long arrays of head-to-tail tandem repetitions, are also abundant components of primate genomes.7 SatDNA monomers (repetitive units) form homogeneous arrays, usually enriched in regions of constitutive heterochromatin, and were hypothesized to be related to the maintenance of centromeric function (reviewed by Plohl et al.8). Multimers of the same satDNA motif may exhibit high similarity to each other, even when the individual monomers show considerable divergence. This organization is referred to as higher order repeats (HORs). Simian centromeres are mainly composed of a-satellite (AS) consisting of units of ~170 bp in the infraorder Catarrhini and ~340 or ~540 bp in NWM.9–11 It was assumed that the HOR blocks of AS was a unique attribute of hominoids. However, Sujiwattanarat et al.12 have recently reported HORs in the NWM Aotus azarae and C. jacchus. They suggested that this type of organization probably occurs in the AS of a wide range of simians.SatDNAs do not code proteins but their transcription has been reported in many organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates and plants (reviewed by Pezer et al.13) where they were shown to participate in the formation of heterochromatin,14 centromeres15 and in gene regulation.16 Chan et al.17 showed that AS transcripts are essential for the localization of mitotic centromere proteins including CENP-C, determining the kinetochore structure on centromeric chromatin during mitosis in humans.In spite of the great biomedical and evolutionary interest of primates, their satDNAs have only been studied in a few groups.18–21 In the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, the only satDNA reported to date is the AS DNA, located in the centromeres of all chromosomes.9,11The recent availability of genomic data for C. jacchus provides an excellent new opportunity to study how satDNAs are organized and influence NWM genome evolution. In this study, we employed an integrated approach, using whole-genome sequence analysis and molecular cytogenetics, to get an in-depth insight into a new satDNA of Callithrix, termed MarmoSAT. Our intention was to better understand its evolution by analyzing an array of NWM genomes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of satDNA in Callithrix jacchus and sequence analysisSimilarity-based clustering, repeat identification, and classification were performed using RepeatExplorer22 with whole-genome shotgun (WGS) Illumina reads from a male C. jacchus (accession number: SRR957684). This pipeline involves an all-to-all comparison of Illumina reads by MEGABLAST and the grouping of similar reads in clusters that represent unique repetitive DNA families. A minimum of 55 nt overlap is required for clustering different reads. A total of 1540214 100 bp reads, representing ~5% coverage of the C. jacchus genome were utilized in the analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1). All clusters with an abundance of at least 0.01% that of the top cluster were analysed in detail (Supplementary Table S1). As the reads utilized represent a random sample of the genome, the abundance of a given repetitive DNA family can be determined by the number of reads present in that specific cluster divided by the total number of reads utilized. The reads from each cluster are further aligned and partially assembled to produce contigs to be used in repeat consensus reconstruction and annotation. All contigs were compared with the mammalian repeat library in Repbase.23,24 Whenever a significant number of reads from two distinct clusters match the similarity parameters, RepeatExplorer indicates these clusters as ‘connected component', pointing to a potential relationship between the repeats.C. jacchus MarmoSAT repeats were retrieved from this species sequenced genome by BLAST searches on the assembled genome (accession number: ACFV00000000.1) using as query a consensus sequence obtained from the RepeatExplorer analysis. Hits with e-values lower than 1 × 10-5 were considered significant. Furthermore, BLAST searches on C. jacchus WGS database present on NCBI were used to retrieve long MarmoSAT arrays on unmapped contigs. In some cases, the Tandem Repeats Finder25 program was used to help in the delimitation of MarmoSAT monomers. The MarmoSAT arrays analysed in unmapped contigs and in assembled chromosomes files were carefully analysed through dot plots to determine the start and end of each repeat. Dot plots were also used to check for similarity between MarmoSAT and AS. These plots were generated with the Dotlet application with a 15 bp word size and 60% similarity cutoff.26Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Muscle 4.0.27 The MEGA software version 5.0528 was used for the calculation of genetic distances and construction of Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees.2.2. Samples, DNA extractions, PCR amplifications, cloning and sequencingChromosome preparations and genomic DNAs were obtained from fibroblast cultures of one male of each Callithrix penicillata, C. geoffroyi, Callimico goeldii and Mico argentatus. Both Callithrix specimens are kept by Dr Alan Lane de Melo in animal facilities at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (permits 1/31/94/0000-8 and 3106.6995/2012-MG from IBAMA and 167/2006 from CETEA/UFMG, revalidated on 16 March 2012). The M. argentatus cells were provided by Dr Yatiyo Yonenaga-Yassuda from the Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil).AS and MarmoSAT were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNAs of the three species with the following primer sets: Alpha-F (ACAGGGAAATATCTGCTTCTAAATC) and Alpha-R (GCTTACTGCTGTTTCTTCCATATG); MarmoSAT-F (ACAGAGTAGAATAGGGCATTG) and MarmoSAT-R (CCAACTCAGTATGCTCTCTCATG). The MarmoSAT set of primers were designed from consensus sequences from an unidentified C. jacchus satDNA. PCR reactions consisted of an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 60 s, 55°C for 60 s and 72°C for 60 s and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were excised from a 1% agarose gel and purified with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System kit (Promega). Selected MarmoSAT repeats were cloned using the pGEM-T-Easy cloning kit (Promega). Recombinant plasmids were sequenced on the ABI3130 platform (Myleus Biotechnology). The sequences generated in this study have GenBank accession numbers KX686899 (MarmoSAT – Cebuella pygmaea), KX686900 and KX686901 (MarmoSAT – Mico argentatus).2.3. CBG-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridizationCBG-banding was obtained according to Sumner.29 The Callithrix, Callimico and M. argentatus karyotypes were mounted following Sherlock et al.,30 Neusser et al.31 and Dumas et al.,32 respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using AS, MarmoSAT and telomeric sequences as probes. The satDNA probes were prepared from PCR purified products labelled by nick translation with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (DIG-Nick Translation mix, Roche Applied Science). A biotinylated telomeric sequence (TTAGGG)4 (Invitrogen) was synthesized and used as probe for FISH. Chromosomes were denatured in 70% formamide/2xSSC at 65% for 1–2 min. The hybridization mix, consisting of 100 ng of labelled probe in 50% formamide/2xSSC, was denatured for 10 min at 98°C and applied to the chromosome preparations. Hybridization was carried out at 37°C for 16–20 hours. Slides were washed in 2xSSC at 37°C for 5 min. Immunodetection was performed with antidigoxigenin conjugated with FITC and neutravidin coupled with rhodamine (Roche Applied Science). The analyses and image acquisition were performed under a Zeiss Axioimager 2 epifluorescence microscope using the AxioVision software (Zeiss).2.4. Transcription analysisWe investigated the transcription of MarmoSAT in several tissues of C. jacchus using the RNA-seq data generated by the Non-Human Primate Reference Transcriptome Resource (NHPRTR; Peng et al.33). These data are publicly available at NCBI under the BioProject PRJNA271912 and include total Ribo-Zero transcriptomes for bone marrow, the left and right brain hemispheres, the pituitary, colon, heart plus thymus, heart only, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle and spleen from a female marmoset.The reads were mapped to a consensus sequence of MarmoSAT using the ‘–sensitive-local' preset of Bowtie2 implemented on the Galaxy platform (http://usegalaxy.org; Langmead and Salzberg34; Giardine et al.35; Goecks et al.36). The Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool was used to investigate potential transcription start sites within MarmoSAT (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html; Reese37). Transcription of the abundant LINE-1 and Alu elements was also examined as described above and compared with that of MarmoSAT using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.3. Results3.1. Identification and characterization of MarmoSATWe identified the most abundant families of repetitive DNAs present in the C. jacchus genome using the similarity-based clustering method implemented on RepeatExplorer.22 We found that highly repetitive elements comprise ~15% of the common marmoset genome, mostly represented by TEs and satDNA families. LINE-like elements represented the most abundant repetitive family, comprising 6.7% of the genome and including 95,112 reads in 21 different clusters. The second most abundant repetitive element, Alu-like/SINE-like, spans 3.6% (54,301 reads) of the common marmoset genome. The AS DNA, the third most abundant repetitive family, represents 1.5% of C. jacchus genome (20,308 reads) and is organized on three different clusters inside this species genome. The fourth most abundant cluster of repetitive DNA was a still uncharacterized tandem repeat named herein MarmoSAT, which represents 1.09% of the genome and is composed of 171 bp AT-rich (61%) motifs. Considering an estimated genome size of 3.4 Gb for C. jacchus38 this new satDNA family would account for more than 37 Mb or ~216,000 copies. MarmoSAT arrays were identified in all assembled chromosome files, including the sex chromosomes, and presented an average size of 2,223 bp, ranging from 296 bp on chromosome 13 to 8,188 bp on chromosome 3. The average nucleotide divergence among repeats is 20.18%, ranging from 11.5% (on chromosome 14) to 39.1% (on chromosome 22) (Supplementary Table S2).The amount of MarmoSAT differed among the assembled chromosome files, but this variation may be related to technical limitations. We also identified arrays present in different loci inside chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21, whereas on chromosomes 8, 15, 16 and 21, MarmoSAT is organized as one single array interspersed with several TEs insertions (Supplementary Table S3).In order to investigate whether MarmoSAT repeats form long-arrays, we performed BLAST searches on unmapped C. jacchus contigs and retrieved the five contigs with the highest score values (accession numbers: ACFV01174585.1, ACFV01176989.1, ACFV01177303.1, ACFV01181345.1and ACFV01184555.1). As a result, we obtained 492 copies of MarmoSAT with an average array size of 99.8 copies per contig, suggesting the presence of long arrays of MarmoSAT in the C. jacchus unmapped data.Because MarmoSAT and AS repeat units have similar sizes (~171 bp), we performed extensive sequence comparisons with described AS sequences from several primates, including C. jacchus and humans, but dot plot analyses could not find any significant similarity hits between the reads in the MarmoSAT cluster and the ones in the ASor CarB clusters, indicating lack of homology (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, BLAST searches revealed no significant similarity between this sequence and any other deposited in the GenBank or RepBase databases.In order to investigate the homogenization dynamics of MarmoSAT related to their genomic location (from different arrays or chromosomes), we constructed NJ phylogenetic trees using 458 copies extracted from all chromosome files, three BACs, one from the X (accession number: AC146662.3) and two from the Y chromosome (accession numbers: AC243896.4 and AC243459.3), and 492 copies retrieved from unassembled contigs (Supplementary Fig. S3). The resulting trees showed that MarmoSAT sequences were not clustered in chromosome-specific branches. Similarly, the repeats found in the three BACs did not cluster together with the assembled sequences of the corresponding X and Y chromosomes. We also produced chromosome-specific trees, but still could not find any array specificity for MarmoSAT repeats (data not shown).3.2. MarmoSAT flanking regions are enriched with Alu-like and L1-Cja-like retrotransposonsAiming to better understand the genomic distribution and possible association with different genetic elements, we analysed 42 flanking regions (from 500 bp to 1 kb, when available) of the MarmoSAT arrays found on the assembled chromosome files (Supplementary Table S3). Our analysis revealed that TEs Alu-like and L1-Cja-like were often associated with MarmoSAT arrays. We found 20 insertions of Alu-like elements adjacent to MarmoSAT arrays, whereas 17 L1-Cja-like elements were found neighbouring MarmoSAT sequences. In contrast, we did not find AS sequences associated with MarmoSAT. We found no preferential positions for TE insertion inside MarmoSAT monomers, and no micro-sequence similarities that could indicate any insertion bias (data not shown).We also found the subtelomeric satDNA family CarB, previously described in M. argentatus,19 flanking the 5' regions of MarmoSAT arrays on chromosomes 14 and 16 (Supplementary Table S3), and one copy flanking MarmoSAT in one BAC mapped on chromosome Y (accession number AC243896.4). Interestingly, we identified CarB as representing only 0.108% of the C. jacchus genome. We found low copy numbers of CarB on chromosomes 1, 3–8, 13–20, and it was absent on the other chromosomes.3.3. Phylogenetic distribution of MarmoSATIn order to ascertain the distribution of MarmoSAT in Cebuella pygmaea and Mico argentatus we amplified this sequence by PCR from genomic DNAs of both species. The sequencing of cloned PCR products from both species confirmed the presence of MarmoSAT in their genomes.The distribution of MarmoSAT in other NWM species was verified by an in silico search using a MarmoSAT query against the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide collection (NCBI). BLAST searches retrieved one significant hit with e-value 2e-13 corresponding to satDNA CgoA (accession number: X52012.1), previously described in Callimico goeldii.18 This 338 bp satDNA family was described as restricted to the C. goeldii genome after Southern blot hybridizations with 70% stringency. Dot-plot analysis of the CgoA repeat unit sequences showed that this satDNA is composed of two monomers (Fig. 1), one with 170 bp (CgoA1), and another with 168 bp (CgoA2). Pairwise sequence comparisons between CgoA monomers revealed 32.9% nucleotide divergence, indicating a HOR organization in C. goeldii. The comparison of CgoA1 and CgoA2 against MarmoSAT revealed 30.3% and 33.3% of divergence, respectively.

The absence of MarmoSAT in the Aotus and Saimiri lineages suggests that this satDNA family probably amplified after the split of Callitrichinae (Fig. 2).

Colored branches indicate the presence of MarmoSAT (green, lighter color) and CarB (red, darker color) satellite DNA families.

Chromosomal location of MarmoSAT on Callitrichini and CallimicoThe chromosome location of MarmoSAT was investigated after FISH on chromosomes from Callithrix penicillata, C. geoffroyi, Mico argentatus and Callimico goeldii. CBG-banding was also performed in order to compare the distribution of MarmoSAT in relation to the constitutive heterochromatin in the four species (Figs 3A and C and 4).

C-D show the results of the same experiments in C. geoffroyi. Bar = 10 µm. Colour visible in online version.The MarmoSAT probe hybridized to both subtelomeric regions of all biarmed chromosomes in C. penicillata, with the exception of pair 3 and the sex chromosomes, which had only their short arms labelled (Fig. 3B). Pairs 1 and 18 showed interstitial labelling on their short and long arms, respectively, whereas pairs 16 and 17 had no hybridization signals. C. geoffroyi chromosomes presented the same hybridization pattern, with the exception of pair 15, which did not display any signal (Fig. 3D). In M. argentatus, MarmoSAT sequences were visualized on both ends of the biarmed pairs 3, 20 and in the sex chromosomes; in the subtelomeric regions of the short arm of pairs 10 and 21 and in the long arms of pairs 2, 5–7, 13 and 14. In addition, interstitial signals were detected in the short arms of pairs 2 and 3 and in the long arms of pairs 5 and 14. Among the acrocentric chromosomes, MarmoSAT sequences hybridized to the long arms of pairs 15, 17 and 19 and to interstitial regions of pairs 15, 16 and 19 (Fig. 4A). In C. goeldii, MarmoSAT sequences were located at subtelomeric regions of the short and long arms of biarmed chromosomes, with the exception of pair 11, which showed signals only on its long arms. The acrocentrics had only their long arms labelled (Fig. 4B). Karyotypes of Mico argentatus after (A) CBG-banding and FISH with MarmoSAT (green) and telomeric sequences (red) probes.

Colour visible in online version.Since MarmoSAT had a telomeric localization, we also performed double FISH with a telomeric probe (TTAGGG)4. Telomeric sequences were detected in all telomeres of the three species (Figs 3B, 3D and 4A) and co-localized with MarmoSAT in most chromosome pairs. Additionally, the Y chromosomes of both Callithrix species had their long arms completely labelled with the telomeric probe.A search for sequencing reads that spanned the interface between MarmoSAT and telomeric sequences on the Trace Archive File of C. jacchus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/home/) revealed two reads composed by MarmoSAT arrays adjacent to telomeric repeats. In both cases, the telomeric repeats were in the terminal 3' position, indicating a subtelomeric location of MarmoSAT (Fig. 5).

This satDNA is present in large amounts in the (peri)centromeric regions of these marmosets' chromosomes, corroborating the bioinformatics analysis and previous cytogenetic studies of C. jacchus.11FISH with a digoxigenin-labelled a-satellite DNA in Callitrichini and Callimico goeldii cells.

MarmoSAT is transcribed on several tissues from C. jacchusWe used the NHPRTR33 data to investigate the transcription of MarmoSAT in the tissues of C. jacchus. This analysis revealed MarmoSAT transcripts in all tissues surveyed albeit at very different abundances (Fig. 7). The 13 tissues analysed displayed over 11-fold variation in the transcription level of MarmoSAT, with a higher-than-average transcript level in brain (left and right hemispheres), heart plus thymus, heart only and spleen (Fig. 7).

RPKM: Reads Per Kilobase Million. Because we found no putative promoter regions in MarmoSAT sequences, since L1 and Alu were the sequences most commonly associated with MarmoSAT arrays, we also analysed their transcripts (Supplementary Table S3). L1 and Alu also displayed ubiquitous transcription, but showed no significant correlation with MarmoSAT transcription levels (Spearman's R = 0.24692 and -0.1318, P = 0.3733 and 0.6693, respectively), and only moderate correlation with one another (R = 0.4835 and P = 0.097; Supplementary Fig. S4).4. DiscussionIn this study, we identified a new satDNA with 171 bp monomers in the common marmoset genome, which was named MarmoSAT. Regardless of the same motif size, MarmoSAT and AS do not share any sequence similarity or conserved structure that could suggest a common origin (Supplementary Fig. S2). The presence of two non-homologous complex satDNA families that share the same motif size was not previously reported in primates. It is possible that the convergence to the same motif size reflects the optimal distance for nucleosome positioning, as suggested by Henikoff et al.,39 indicating that despite sequence heterogeneity, different satDNA families may retain structural features important to heterochromatic domains in C. jacchus.4.1. Evolutionary turnover of subtelomeric satDNAs MarmoSAT and CarB in CallitrichiniSatDNAs have been identified in the subtelomeric heterochromatin of most marmoset chromosomes19,20,40. In the Callithrix species analysed herein we found MarmoSAT to be a major component of these regions (Fig. 3). The hybridization of MarmoSAT and telomeric sequences showed very similar patterns in both C. penicillata and C. geoffroyi, which may be explained by the recent diversification of the clade (2.6 Mya).3Together with the cytogenetic analysis, our searches on assembled genomes and WGS data of NWMs showed that MarmoSAT is apparently restricted to Callithrix, Mico, Callimico and Cebuella, while CarB is present in Callithrix and Mico (Fig. 2). Therefore, MarmoSAT and CarB repeats, a satDNA previously described in Mico species,19,20 were already present in the common ancestor of Callitrichini and C. goeldii. The FISH experiments revealed that MarmoSAT is more abundant in Callithrix and C. goeldii than in Mico (Figs 3 and 4). Accordingly, Fanning et al.18 CgoA description supports MarmoSAT high abundancy in C. goeldii. Altogether, these results support the hypothesis that MarmoSAT sequences were probably abundant in the ancestor of Callitrichini and C. goeldii and remained copious in Callithrix and Callimico. On the other hand, CarB underwent amplification in Mico, as shown by Alves et al.19 and Canavez et al.,20 replacing MarmoSAT. This assumption is supported for instance by comparing the homologous M. argentatus chromosome 4 and Callithrix chromosome 13, M. argentatus chromosome 5 short arm and Callithrix pair 20, and M. argentatus chromosome 18 and Callithrix 19, in which the Callithrix counterparts showed MarmoSAT hybridization, whereas in M. argentatus chromosomes there were large heterochromatic blocks mainly composed of CarB.The amplification of specific satDNAs was already reported in Callimico and Cebuella.18,40 In marmosets, the differential amplification of unrelated satDNAs does not seem to affect karyotype stability, as this group of NWMs has conserved karyotypes.4.2. MarmoSAT subtelomeric arrays lack chromosome-specificitySatDNA repeats on the same array or chromosome tend to present a higher level of sequence similarity to each other when compared with those on non-homologous chromosomes.41,42 An NJ phylogenetic tree with 980 copies of MarmoSAT revealed that these sequences lack chromosome specificity (Supplementary Fig. S3). The absence of differential homogenization for specific variants between MarmoSAT subtelomeric arrays in C. jacchus could be the result of exchange events between arrays and chromosomes. This hypothesis is supported by data in chimpanze, in which it has been shown that the subterminal regions of different chromosomes interact with each other to form stable physical contacts in meiosis,43 which may result in frequent DNA exchanges between chromatids. Moreover, Rudd et al.44 showed that in humans, 17% of all sister chromatid exchanges occur in the terminal ~100 kb of chromosomes, translating into a recombination rate on subtelomeric regions 160-fold larger than in euchromatic regions.4.3. MarmoSAT is present as HORs in Callimico goeldiiAnother significant finding was the identification of MarmoSAT organized in HOR structures in C. goeldii. Although HORs are apparently common and widespread in primates,10,12 they are predominantly located at (peri)centromeric, rather than in subtelomeric regions.45 Herein we showed that the previously described copies of CgoA satDNA18 are in fact two highly different monomers of MarmoSAT organized in HORs (Fig. 1). Probably, the establishment of a HOR organization occurred after the divergence of C. jacchus and C. goeldii ~8 million years ago (Mya) (Fig. 2). Moreover, we observed that the subtelomeric location of MarmoSAT is shared among Callitrichini species and C. goeldii (Figs 3 and 4) This is the first report of subtelomeric HORs in primates, indicating that HORs sequences may be found in heterochromatic regions outside of centromeres.The example of HORs in closely related species such as C. jacchus and C. goeldii is illuminating since it shows that HORs may develop over a relatively short period of evolutionary time. In contrast with what was found in C. jacchus AS,12 the sequence similarity between C. goeldii CgoA1 and CgoA2 repeat units is considerably lower than 70%. This pattern is similar to the observed in previously described HORs from primates and bovids.21,464.4. Possible role for L1 in MarmoSAT dispersionThe presence of several MarmoSAT arrays adjacent to L1 opens the possibility that their dispersion could have been mediated by these retroelements (Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, we detected many copies of MarmoSAT located interstitially on C. penicillata and C. geoffroyi pairs 1 and 18 and M. argentatus pairs 2, 3, 5, 14–16 and 19 (Figs 3 and 4). In humans, it has been shown in vivo and in vitro that the L1 can co-mobilize 3’ downstream sequences to other genomic locations as the result of imperfect transcription events47. During the transposition event the transcription of an L1-element may bypass its own polyadenylation signal utilizing a second downstream polyadenylation site for 3’ end processing, leading to the transcription and later transposition of adjacent flanking sequences. Even though most of L1-elements have truncated sequences, these elements are still capable of retrotransposition,48 suggesting that even incomplete L1s may play a role in such events.The finding of Alu-like and L1-Cja-like flanking MarmoSAT may have resulted from a bias in assembling repetitive DNAs with WGS data, due to the high sequence similarity among repeats.49 In fact, unmapped sequences have a low frequency of TEs insertions when compared with the sequences present in assembled chromosomes. We also observed that these TEs lack preferential insertion sites in MarmoSAT arrays, either target sites or array positioning, indicating a probable random nature for these events. For example, it has been suggested that L1 elements have a cleavage site preference for sequences rich in AA|TTT,50 but we did not observe any insertion at these specific sites. Although MarmoSAT sequences have three different AA|TTT regions, the absence of TEs insertions may be affected by the local chromatin structure.51 Alternatively, TEs loci inside MarmoSAT sequences may have suffered several mutations resulting in different sequences compared with the initial insertion regions.4.5. Potential functional roles of MarmoSATAlbeit being devoid of protein-coding capacity, satDNAs may possess structural and/or functional roles, usually via expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs; reviewed by Biscotti et al.52). Interestingly, we found MarmoSAT-derived transcripts in all tissues analysed (Fig. 7) and because this satDNA does not possess promoter regions we conclude that its transcription is probably initiated in flanking sequences. The most frequent sequences flanking MarmoSAT arrays are L1 and Alu retroelements, but MarmoSAT transcription levels do not correlate with those from these elements (Supplementary Fig. S4). Because of its abundance and presence in almost all chromosomes, MarmoSAT could be transcribed from a number of different loci and have different promoters, inside or outside L1/Alu.Besides the subtelomeric location determined by FISH, we found Sanger sequencing reads that span both MarmoSAT and the telomeric repeats in C. jacchus (Fig. 5). ncRNAs containing telomeric repeats in mammals are known as telomere repeat containing RNAs (TERRAs) and are thought to regulate telomerase and to modulate telomeric chromatin throughout the cell cycle (reviewed in Luke and Lingner53). TERRAs transcription has been shown to start at subtelomeric repeats towards the chromosome ends in human, mouse and yeast.54–56 MarmoSAT abundance and location make it possible to suggest that it could be part of TERRAs. Moreover, MarmoSAT expression profile is similar to the TERRA expression found in mouse, with higher levels of transcripts in spleen, kidney and thymus.55 Although the results presented herein are suggestive of interesting functional roles for MarmoSAT transcripts, the validity of these hypotheses must be assessed experimentally.5. ConclusionsIn this study, we identified with a combination of bioinformatics and cytogenetics, a subtelomeric satDNA, termed MarmoSAT, in the common marmoset and provided insights into its organization and evolution. Our data suggest that MarmoSAT originated in the common ancestor of Callitrichini and Callimico goeldii. Interestingly, the MarmoSAT arrays are organized in HORs in C. goeldii. We also propose that MarmoSAT transcripts may play a role in telomeric chromatin.

IntroductionPhotosynthetic organisms have evolved various photoacclimation mechanisms to perform photosynthesis under varying light conditions. Cyanobacteria are Gram-negative prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis using two photosynthetic reaction centers, namely photosystems II and I.1 They utilize an antenna complex called the phycobilisome, which harvests and transfers light energy to the photosystems.2,3 The typical phycobilisome comprises a central core and multiple peripheral rods, each of which consists of tetrapyrrole-bound phycobiliproteins and non-chromophorylated linker proteins.2,3 Most cyanobacteria utilize the phycobiliproteins allophycocyanin (APC) and phycocyanin (PC) for the core and rods, respectively. Certain species utilize the additional phycobiliprotein phycoerythrocyanin or phycoerythrin (PE) for the rods. These phycobiliproteins absorb light of differing wavelengths: 650–670 nm for APC, 620–630 nm for PC, 550–620 nm for phycoerythrocyanin, and 490–570 nm for PE. These phycobiliproteins are organized by linker proteins to allow directional energy transfer from distal phycoerythrocyanin or PE to proximal PC within the rod, then to APC in the core, and finally to the photosystems. Interestingly, direct interaction of the PC rods to the photosystems has been reported in some strains,4,5 suggesting the diversity of light harvesting processes in the cyanobacteria phylum.Certain cyanobacteria maximize their light-harvesting capacity by remodeling phycobilisome components, which is called chromatic acclimation (CA). In the 1970s, cyanobacterial species that produce both PE and PC were classified into three groups based on changes in their PE and PC content in response to green and red light.6 Group I species show no change in PC or PE content in response to green or red light. Group II species accumulate PE under green light but not under red light, and they constitutively produce PC. Group III species accumulate PE under green light but not under red light, whereas they accumulate PC under red light but not under green light. The CA of Group II and Group III species are called CA of ‘type’ 2 (CA2) and ‘type’ 3 (CA3), respectively,7 and there is no CA1. CA3 is also referred to as complementary CA because cell color changes complementary to the ambient light color.7,8 CA2 and CA3 occur in terrestrial and freshwater cyanobacteria.6 In the 2000s, marine cyanobacteria were shown to change the composition of their tetrapyrrole chromophores of PE, blue light-absorbing phycourobilin, and green light-absorbing phycoerythrobilin. This is called CA of type 4 (CA4) and occurs in marine Synechococcus lineages.9,10 Recently, certain terrestrial cyanobacteria have been shown to remodel proteins of the phycobilisome core and reaction center of photosystems with synthesis of chlorophyll f or d under far-red light.11 This acclimation is called far-red light photoacclimation, and it is critical for species deep within bacterial mats, where only far-red light is available.Photosensors for these photoacclimation processes of cyanobacteria have been identified by forward and reverse genetic approaches.7,8,12 CA3 and CA2 are regulated by the cyanobacteriochrome-class photosensors RcaE and CcaS,13,14 respectively, which utilize the change of bilin protonation state for their unique green/red absorption change.15 In CA3, RcaE phosphorylates response regulator RcaC via phosphotransfer protein RcaF under red light.13,16,17 Phosphorylated RcaC binds to the inverted sequence motif called the L-box in the promoter of the genes encoding PC and phycocyanobilin synthase and activates their expression.17 Phosphorylated RcaC also binds to the promoter of PE genes to repress their expression. In CA2, CcaS phosphorylates response regulator CcaR under green light.14,18 The phosphorylated CcaR binds to the direct repeat sequence called the G-box in the promoter of PE genes, and activates their expression.18 FaRLiP is regulated by RfpA, which is a canonical phytochrome of the knot-less type and undergoes a red/far-red photocycle.11 RfpA phosphorylates response regulator RfpB via phosphotransfer protein RfpC under far-red light19. Phosphorylated RfpB induces far-red–adapted subunits of APC, photosystem II, photosystem I.11 The photosensor for CA4 has not been identified, but CA4 is regulated at the transcriptional level by the two response regulators FciA and FciB.20 The RcaE/F/C, CcaS/R and RfpA/C/B systems are distributed in many, but not all, cyanobacteria genomes with weak phylogenetic relationships,12,21 suggesting that horizontal gene transfer played an important role in the evolution of these photoacclimation systems.To explore variations in the CA process, we focused on CA-capable cyanobacteria Geminocystis sp. strains National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES)-3708 and NIES-3709, whose complete genome sequences were previously determined by our group.22,23 We performed spectroscopic analysis and genome and transcriptome comparisons of strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709 in response to green and red light. We demonstrate that the two strains share the common process of CA regulated by the CcaS/R system but that differences in the structure of PE rods underlie the observed differences in the cellular PE content between the two strains. In addition, we propose to reclassify CA based on the gene structure of the CcaS/R cluster to include cyanobacteria that produce PC but not PE. Our study expands our understanding of the diversity of CA processes in the cyanobacteria phylum.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains, growth conditions, and spectral analysesGeminocystis sp. strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709 were obtained from the culture collection of the NIES of Japan. Cells were grown in liquid BG11 medium continuously bubbled with air containing 1% (v/v) CO2 at 30 °C. Cells were irradiated with 20 µE m-2 s-1 green light (peak at 524 nm) or 15 µE m-2 s-1 red light (peak at 658 nm), which was supplied by colored fluorescent lamps (FL20S-G or FL20S-R; Panasonic). Emission lines of the fluorescent lamps were removed by a green or red filter (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cellular absorption spectra were obtained with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Model V-650; JASCO) equipped with a transmission integrating sphere (Model ISV-722; JASCO). Low-temperature fluorescence emission and excitation spectra at 77K were obtained with a fluorescence spectrometer (Model FP8300; JASCO) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooling unit (Model PMU-830; JASCO).2.2. Isolation of phycobilisomeCells were harvested by centrifugation, and washed with 0.65 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Cells volumes were adjusted to 100 µl, resuspended in 1 ml of the phosphate buffer, and broken using a TyssueLyser II (Qiagen) with 0.9 g of zirconia/silica beads (0.1 mm diameter) at 30Hz for 1 min at room temperature. The cell extract was treated with 1.8% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in the phosphate buffer for 30 min in the dark and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 18 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10–50% (wt/vol) linear sucrose density gradient in the phosphate buffer and then centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 12 h at 18 °C.2.3. Genome comparisonNucleotide sequences of accessions AP014815 through AP014820 for strain NIES-3708 and AP014821 through AP014832 for strain NIES-3709 were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (1 March 2017, date last accessed)). The genome synteny plot of the chromosomes of the two strains was drawn using GenomeMatcher.24 Circular plots of the chromosomes and plasmids were drawn using ArcWithColor ver. 1.4, an accessory tool of GenomeMatcher. Protein alignments were analysed using Clustal X.25 Homology searches were preformed using BLAST+.26 The phylogenetic tree was prepared using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (1 March 2017, date last accessed)). 2.4. RNA sequencing analysisTotal RNA was extracted from 70-ml Geminocystis liquid cultures at mid-logarithmic growth phase. Liquid cultures were cooled quickly with ice and then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were transferred to microtubes and centrifuged again; then 400 µl buffer RLT of the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) containing 1% (v/v) ß-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 g zirconia/silica beads was added to each pellet. Cells were broken for 1.5 min by TissueLyser II at 30 Hz. The extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit. Genomic DNA was digested using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). Ribosomal RNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal kit for Bacteria (Illumina). RNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina). Single end of the libraries were sequenced on the MiSeq instrument with the MiSeq Reagent kit v2 (50- cycles; Illumina). Read mapping was performed using BWA version 0.7.1227 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The mapped reads were counted using HTSeq version 0.6.1,28 and the counts were normalized as reads per kilobase of CDS per million mapped reads (RPKM).3. Results and discussion3.1. Spectroscopic analyses of CADuring the cultivation of the cells of Geminocystis sp. strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, we noticed that cellular colors of the two strains are different, though they belong to the same Geminocystis genus. Therefore, we cultured cells of the two strains under continuous green or red light and characterized their properties of CA. Photomicrographs of the cells showed that the NIES-3708 cells were spherical, with ~5-µm diameter (Fig. 1A). The NIES-3709 cells were slightly oval, with ~5 and ~3 µm longer and shorter axes, respectively, and they contained granular structures (Fig. 1A). Under green light NIES-3708 cells appeared brown, whereas NIES-3709 cells were reddish brown (Fig. 1A). Under red light, both strains appeared blue-green (Fig. 1A). Cellular absorption spectra, which were normalized to chlorophyll at 677 nm, showed that both strains accumulated PE under green light (peak, 567 nm) but not under red light, whereas they accumulated PC under both green and red light (peak, 623 nm; Fig. 1B and C). The peak wavelength of chlorophyll, PE, and PC were the same between the two strains and both light conditions. Characterization of CA of two Geminocystis strains. A, Micrographs of Geminocystis sp.

Spectra were normalized at APC peaks.Phycobilisomes of the two strains, which were fully acclimated to green or red light, were isolated with sucrose density gradient, yielding two major fractions. The lower and upper fractions were designated to fraction 1 and fraction 2, respectively (Fig. 1D). Absorption spectra showed that the fraction 1 contains PE (peak, 566 nm), PC (peak, 618-620 nm), and APC (shoulder, 650 nm) (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, the fraction 2 contains small amount of chlorophylls (peak, 676 nm) and no detectable APC (Fig. 1F). Low-temperature fluorescence emission spectra showed that the fraction 1 has maximum emission from APC (peak, 683–684 nm), whereas the fraction 2 has maximum emission from PC (peak, 649–650 nm) (Fig. 1G and H). Low-temperature fluorescence excitation spectra of the fraction 1 are similar to absorption spectra of that (Fig. 1I and E), suggesting that both PE and PC efficiently transfer light energy to APC (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that the fraction 1 contains the intact phycobilisome, whereas the fraction 2 contains dissociated rods consisting of PE and PC. Notably, the positions of the fraction 1 are lower under green light than under red light in the two strains (Fig. 1D). In addition, heights of absorption peaks of PC relative to APC in the fraction 1 do not change in the two strains (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that both strains do not replace PC rods chromatically, but they synthesize additional PE rods in the peripheral position of PC rods under green light, which is classified as CA2 by the conventional classification of CA.6The two strains were originally isolated from freshwater environment where other cyanobacteria or algae compete for light energy. Notably, strain NIES-3709 accumulated more PE than NIES-3708 under green light (Fig. 1E and F). On the other hand, strain NIES-3708 repressed synthesis of PE more completely than NIES-3709 under red light (Fig. 1E and F). These findings suggest that strain NIES-3709 has been adapted to green light rich environment more than strain NIES-3708 does. During cultivation of the cells in the liquid medium with bubbling, the two strains form cellular aggregates, and strain NIES-3709 shows more severe aggregation than strain NIES-3708 does (data not shown). Self-shading due to aggregation or competition for light energy with other organisms due to sedimentation of aggregates might produce the different capacity of PE accumulation between the two strains.3.2. Whole-genome comparisonTo explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the different CA responses, we compared the gapless complete genome sequences of strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, which were previously determined by our group.22,23 Sequence identity of the 16S rRNA gene between the two strains was 97.5%. Genome synteny of the chromosome was not conserved between the two strains (Supplementary Fig. S2). These findings suggest that the two strains are distantly related to each other although they both belong to genus Geminocystis. Therefore, we compared the gene content of the two strains at the amino acid level (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). First, orthologous genes were predicted based on bidirectional best hits in the BLASTP program with e-value <E-5 (Fig. 2A).26 Second, the paralogous genes were predicted based on unidirectional best hits in BLASTP using translated protein sequences that were not assigned to orthologs as the query and the orthologous protein sequences as the subject. Finally, genes that were not assigned as orthologs or paralogs were considered unique genes. A total of 2,714 genes were predicted to be orthologs in the two strains (Fig. 2B;Supplementary Fig. S3). For each of NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, 342 and 385 genes were predicted to be paralogs and 583 and 838 genes were predicted to be unique, respectively (Fig. 2B;Supplementary Fig. S3). We compared the coverage, identity, and e-values from BLASTP of the orthologs and paralogs. Most of the orthologs had high coverage, high identity, and low e-values (Fig. 2C), suggesting that ortholog prediction based on bidirectional best hit is a simple but reliable approach. On the other hand, coverage and identity of the paralogs rapidly decreased with increasing e-value (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the predicted paralog set may contain some unique genes. Conversely, this means that the confidence was high in our prediction of the unique genes. Bidirectional and unidirectional BLASTP best hit analyses.

C and D, Ordered distribution of coverage, identity, similarity scores, and BLASTP e-values in the orthologous (C) and the paralogous genes (D).Genes encoding the phycobilisome components and its associated proteins are highly conserved in strains both NIES-3708 and NIES-3709 although those of strain NIES-3709 are more scattered across the genome compared with NIES-3708 (Fig. 3A). For biosynthesis of the APC core, both NIES-3708 and NIES-3709 harbor two copies of genes for the core subunit (apcB1A1, apcB2, acpA2), small core linker (apcC), and chromophorylated large core membrane linker (apcE). For biosynthesis of the PC rod, both strains harbor single-copy genes for the core subunit (cpcBA), rod-core linker (cpcG), phycocyanobilin chromophore synthase (pcyA), and chromophore lyases (cpcF, cpcU). Neither strain harbors genes for the rod linker for PC (cpcC), small rod-capping linker (cpcD), or core-membrane linker (cpcL). For biosynthesis of PE rods, which locate in peripheral position of PC rods, both strains harbor single copies of genes for the core subunit (cpeBA), phycoerythrobilin chromophore synthase (pebBA), and chromophore lyases (cpeT, cpeS). We found that the copy number of PE rod linker genes (cpeC, cpeE) is the only difference in composition of the phycobilisome genes between the two strains. Strain NIES-3708 harbors three copies of the PE rod linker gene (GM3708_1496, GM3708_1476, GM3708_1488), whereas NIES-3709 harbors four copies (GM3709_2916, GM3709_1229, GM3709_2683, GM3709_2915) (Fig. 3A). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that GM3708_1496, GM3708_1476, GM3709_2916, and GM3709_1229 belong to the cpeC family, whereas GM3709_2683, GM3709_2915, and GM3708_1488 belong to the cpeE family (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we designated GM3708_1476 and GM3709_1229 as cpeC1, GM3708_1496 and GM3709_2916 as cpeC2, GM3708_1488 and GM3709_2683 as cpeE1, and GM3709_2915 as cpeE2 (Fig. 3A and B).

Arrows indicate the direct repeats of the G-box.18The CcaS/R photosensing system, which is composed of the green/red light–sensing cyanobacteriochrome CcaS and cognate response regulator CcaR, is conserved in the two strains.18 Multiple alignment showed that the CcaR-binding direct repeat G-box is conserved in the promoter of the cpeE1-cpeR1 operon in the two strains (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the CcaS/R system directly regulates the expression of this operon. CpeR has been established genetically, but not yet biochemically, to be the transcriptional activator for cpeBA and pebAB.8,29,30 The CcaS/R system genes are clustered with the gene that encodes the rod-membrane linker CpcL in the typical CA2 performing cyanobacterium N. punctiforme but not in Geminocystis strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709.18 CpcL is a homolog of the rod-core linker protein CpcG, but it harbors a C-terminal hydrophobic helix that localizes it to the thylakoid membrane rather than the APC core.31 In Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, CpcL has been shown to form atypical phycobilisome consisting of only rod to transfer light energy preferentially to the photosystem I.5 The absence of cpcL in the two Geminocystis strains suggests that they harbor phycobilisomes with the typical core and rod structure and that they regulate PE, but not PC, using the CcaS/R system, which is distinct from CA2 of Nostoc punctiforme.14,18Domain architecture of cyanobacteriochromes and phytochromes in strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709.

We predicted the light wavelengths absorbed by these cyanobacteriochromes using the reference absorption spectra set of cyanobacteriochromes of N. punctiforme ATCC 29133,34 an organism for which the spectral properties and sequence motifs that determine the absorption have been characterized most extensively. Seven of these cyanobacteriochromes are orthologs in the two strains: two blue/green-sensing phototaxis regulators of PixJ (GM3708_1098 and GM3708_1100, GM3709_2064, and GM3709_2062),35,36 two violet sensors (GM3708_2600 and GM3708_34, GM3709_2442 and GM3709_2515), a violet-sensing circadian clock regulator of CikA (GM3708_1578, GM3709_546),37 a green/red-sensing CA regulator of CcaS (GM3708_1490, GM3709_2685)14 and a red/green sensor (GM3708_2773, GM3709_1938). The protochromic triad residues required for the green/red photocycle is conserved in CcaS of strains NIES-3708 and NIES-370915 (Supplementary Fig. S4). For unique cyanobacteriochrome genes, strain NIES-3708 harbors the gene for a blue/green sensor (GM3708_1188), whereas strain NIES-3709 harbors the gene for a different blue/green sensor (GM3709_3634). In CA3 of F. diplosiphon, the orange/teal light–sensing cyanobacteriochrome DpxA is suggested to support PE repression in addition to RcaE.38 No gene encoding DpxA or RcaE was found in the genomes of strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, suggesting that the CcaS/R system is the sole CA regulator in these strains. We found that strain NIES-3708 displayed negative phototaxis for red light but not for green light, whereas strain NIES-3709 did not show phototaxis (data not shown). NIES-3708 harbours phototaxis regulators of the PixJ class but not of the UirS/PixA or Cph2 class,39–41 implying that PixJ may regulate the phototaxis of NIES-3708. NIES-3709 also harbours the red/far-red sensor of the biliverdin-binding phytochrome CphB (GM3709_3327),42 suggesting that this strain responds to near far-red light (700–750 nm). Further studies are necessary to delineate these complex light-sensing pathways.3.3. Transcriptome changesChanges in the global gene expression during CA3 have been studied in F. diplosiphon by genomic microarray analysis,43 but expression changes during CA2 have not been explored. Therefore, we performed RNA-Seq of strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709 during their acclimation to green or red light (Fig. 5). Numbers of raw mapped reads and normalized RPKM values in triplicate were determined for all CDSs (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). We searched for genes that have been annotated with known functions and that showed a >2-fold change in expression between green and red light (Fig. 5). In strain NIES-3708 under red light, gene expression levels were high for photosystem II (psb genes), photosystem I (psa genes), ATPase (atp genes), NDH (ndh genes), iron transporting systems (fecC, exbBD, futA1, piuC, feoAB), and photoprotection protein during iron-starvation (isiAB); under green light, expression levels were high for PE components (cpeBA, cpeYZ, ccaS, pebAB) and type IV pili (pilA1, pilA2, pilY1). In strain NIES-3709 under red light, gene expression levels were high for nitrate transport system (nrtA, nrtC) and photoprotection protein (isiA); under green light, expression levels were high for PE (cpeBA, cpeYZ, ccaS, pebAB), photosystem II (psbA), cytochrome C553 subunit, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (cpoX), and sigma factor (sigG). In an RNA-Seq study of Leptolyngbya sp. strain JSC-1 during iron starvation, the gene expression of the most components of the photosynthetic apparatus did not change.44 Therefore, we speculate that the higher synthesis activity of photosynthetic apparatus components requiring iron would produce relatively iron-limited conditions under red light for strain NIES-3708, leading to induction of iron uptake and iron-starvation resistance systems. PilA is a component of type IV pili and is required for biofilm formation, uptake of DNA, and phototaxis.45 The pilA1 of strain NIES-3708 showed the highest expression (RPKM of 276,643 under green light, 68,645 under red light) and was induced by 4-fold under green light, whereas pilA of strain NIES-3709 was not induced (Fig. 5; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). It will be interesting to explore whether the pili genes of strain NIES-3708 is regulated by a cyanobacteriochrome-class photoreceptor (Fig. 4). Transcriptome comparison during CA.

RNA-Seq analysis of strains NIES-3708 (left) and NIES-3709 (right) under green or red light. Dashed cyan lines indicate the borders of 2-fold change in expression.We then carefully compared the expression of phycobilisome components. The order of RPKM values for the phycobilisome genes were similar in the two strains: ~104 for major phycobiliproteins, ~103 for linker proteins, and 101 to 103 for regulators, bilin synthases, and bilin lyases (Fig. 6). In both NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, expression of genes for the APC core and PC rods was greater under red light than green light. For PE, genes for phycobiliproteins (cpeBA), one rod linker (cpeE1), one regulator (cpeR1), phycoerythrobilin synthase (pebAB), and bilin lyase (cpeYZ) were significantly induced under green light in the two strains (Fig. 6). In contrast, expression of genes for other PE rod linkers (cpeE2, cpeC1, cpeC2) and bilin lyases (cpeSUT) were induced to a similar or higher degree under red light. Our genome analysis of the two strains suggested that the CcaS/R photosensing system directly regulates the expression of cpeE1 and cpeR1, and the induced CpeR1 regulator further activates the expression of cpeBA, cpeYZ, and pebAB29,46. In N. punctiforme, higher expression of cpcBA, cpcG, and cpeE under red light than green light has been observed in both ccaS and ccaR mutants, suggesting that the system for balancing excitation between phycobilisome and photosystems is responsible for the red-light activation of these genes1. We assume that the same balancing system activates the expression of genes for phycobilisome components other than cpeE1, cpeR1, cpeBA, cpeYZ, and pebAB in strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709. Notably, the linker genes expressed under green light were cpeC1, cpeC2, cpeE1, and cpeE2 for strain NIES-3709 and cpeC1, cpeC2, and cpeE1 for strain NIES-3708. In the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, deletion of cpcC1 causes absence of not only CpcC1 but also CpcC2 in the phycobilisome,47 suggesting that CpcC1 is located in a central position in the PC rod whereas CpcC2 is located in a peripheral position. In this study, expression of CpeE1 is strictly regulated by the CcaS/R system, suggesting that the role of CpeE1 differs that of other rod linkers. We speculate that in strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, the light-regulated CpeE1 is located at the base position of PE rods to control energy transfer from PE to PC. Taken our data of spectroscopy, genome and transcriptome together, we assume the molecular process of the CA in strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709 as follows. Both strains harbor a canonical phycobilisome rod and core structure. The CcaS/R photosystem increases the ‘length’ of PE rods on the PC rods under green light, whereas the excitation balancing system of phycobilisome and photosystems increases the ‘number’ of phycobilisomes containing only the PC rods and APC core under red light. The copy number of PE rod linkers differentiated the length of PE rods between the two strains, leading to the different cellular PE content under green light. Further analyses of the phycobilisome of the two strains are required to confirm the exact location of each rod linker. RPKM values for phycobilisome and related genes.

RPKM values for genes encoding phycobiliproteins, linkers, regulators bilin synthases, and bilin lyases genes in strains NIES-3708 (upper) and NIES-3709 (lower) under green (green, left bar) or red (red, right bar) light. Error bars indicate standard deviation of triplicate measurements.We observed that expression of the gene for the CcaS photosensor was induced under green light: 13.3-fold in strain NIES-3708 and 9.4-fold in NIES-3709. On the other hand, expression of the gene for the cognate response regulator CcaR was not induced under green light (1.0-fold difference in strain NIES-3708, and 0.7-fold in NIES-3709). When CcaS/R is heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, green light-induced PcpcG2 activity is enhanced proportional to the increase in CcaS protein.48 Consistently, ccaS is located in the green light-induced operon in all other CA2 species (Fig. 7), suggesting that the induction of ccaS is a common mechanism to improve the induction ratio of phycobilisome genes. The induction ratios of cpeE1 and cpeR1 were 799 and 177 in strain NIES-3708 and 97 and 42 in NIES-3709, respectively. Thus, the CcaS/R system of NIES-3708 shows higher induction than that of NIES-3709 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The different induction ratios of cpeR1 led to a 39- and 9-fold induction of cpeBA in strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709, respectively (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4), leading to the observed difference in repression activity of PE under red light (Fig. 1E). Because the expression of each of ccaS and ccaR was similar in the two strains, we assume that changes in the kinase or phosphatase activity of the CcaS/R system caused the differences in PE-repression activity. The CcaS/R system is emerging as a useful photoswitch in optogenetics. Screening for the best photoswitch genes in the emerging cyanobacterial genomes will be important for the development of superior optogenetic tools. CA types of strains NIES-3708 and NIES-3709.

Reclassification of CAIn the 1970s, based on the changes of absorption peaks of partially purified phycobiliproteins, two types of CA were characterized: CA2 modulates PE content only, whereas CA3 modulates both PE and PC contents. Therefore, CA2 and CA3 have been defined only in cyanobacteria that produce both PC and PE. However, this spectrum-based classification of CA does not entirely fit with the diverse molecular processes of CA, which have been revealed by recent genome-based studies. First, the CcaS/R photosensing system for CA2 is also found in cyanobacteria that produce PC but not PE, such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Leptolyngbya boryana PCC 6306, Pseudanabaena bicep PCC 7429, and Anabaena sp. 39865 (Fig. 7). Regulation of cpcL in these species is suggested to maintain the excitation balance between photosystems I and II.14,18 Second, the typical CA2-performing cyanobacterium N. punctiforme regulates both PE genes and cpcL using the CcaS/R system (Fig. 7). This indicates that N. punctiforme regulates both PE and PC content and apparently conflicts with the initial definition of CA2. In addition, standardization of light quality, light intensity, incubation conditions, and extraction of phycobiliproteins among laboratories is difficult. For example, Calothrix sp. PCC 7103 is classified as a Group III strain, but it harbours the CcaS/R system in the genome. To resolve these inconsistencies, we propose to reclassify the conventional CA2 based on the gene sets in the CcaS/R-photosensing cluster, including the cyanobacterial species that do not harbor PE (Fig. 7). In this reclassification, the cpcL regulation in cyanobacteria that produce only PC is designated CA of type zero (CA0). The regulation of only PE genes is designated as genuine CA2, as identified in our present study. The regulation of PE genes and cpcL is designated as a CA2/0 hybrid. This genome-based classification of CA will be useful as much more cyanobacterial genomes will be available in the near future.We are grateful to Dr David M. Kehoe, Dr Annegret Wilde, Dr Wolfgang R.

IntroductionDNA polymorphisms including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (INDELs), among inbred lines or collected individuals have been employed to identify loci associated with traits or to predict phenotypes by genotypes. To identify genes associated with phenotypes and implement high-throughput breeding, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction (GP) studies have been performed with next-generation sequencing (NGS) data1–4. In GWAS and GP studies, SNPs are widely used as genetic markers. SNPs are determined by mapping NGS reads and consequent variant calls with conventional tools. Widely used software, such as Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) or Bowtie 2 performs alignments of NGS reads to reference genomes5,6, whereas SAMtools/BCFtools or Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) call variants based on alignments produced during the mapping steps7–11. The accuracy of both mapping and variant calling should be key factors for the effectiveness of GWAS and GP.SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK accurately call SNPs if provided with enough number of reads. When read coverage (depth) is 20X or more, SNPs have been called with sufficient sensitivity in human genome resequencing12. It is also reported that SNP calling becomes difficult under low read coverage (7X or lower)12. In large-scale GWAS or GP studies, the number of NGS reads in each individual tends to be small in order to genotype as many individuals as possible with a limited budget. In these cases, methodologies that accurately detect large number of SNPs based on a relatively low number of reads are paramount for an efficient implementation of GWAS and GP studies.Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, or genotype-by-sequencing (RAD-seq/GBS), is an economical strategy to identify genome wide polymorphisms13. While whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing methods provide sequencing information from the whole genome, the RAD-seq/GBS methods confine sequencing regions to the fragments neighbouring particular restriction sites. To be precise, in RAD-seq/GBS, regions neighbouring particular restriction sites are sequenced in combination with high-throughput sequencing methods and with subsequent mapping and variant calling steps on reference genome sequences to identify genomic polymorphisms. For example, RAD-seq/GBS reads sets of HindIII which covers only 0.24% of the chicken genome on average (i.e. coverage = 0.0024x) could show 3× or more depth of coverage on the RAD fragments14. Compared with WGS sequencing methods, the RAD-seq/GBS strategy under the same sequencing cost generally assures a relatively higher coverage at each sequencing region, even when the total number of reads is lower in each sample (e.g. inbred lines, individuals, or libraries) with the RAD-seq/GBS strategy.Stacks is a specialized tool for identifying SNPs from RAD-seq/GBS reads15,16. In the Stacks pipeline, identical reads, which are called ‘stack’, are collected from each sample. Then, SNPs among samples are identified by comparing among stacks obtained from multiple samples. Stacks are capable of calling many SNPs compared to SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK with low coverage RAD-seq/GBS reads. However, Stacks can call false positive SNPs more frequently than other methods (as is shown in this work).In this study, we developed a new tool, Heap, that identifies numerous SNPs with high accuracy from RAD-seq/GBS or WGS sequencing reads. Heap is capable of detecting SNPs with high sensitivity, which is the ratio of correctly identified SNPs (True positives) to all the existing SNPs (True positives + False negatives), and high positive predictive values (PPVs), which is the ratio of True positives to all the identified SNPs (True positives + False positives), from even reads with a low coverage aligned to the reference genome sequences. To confirm the performance of Heap, we identified SNPs from RAD-seq/GBS reads and calculated an accuracy index F-score, which is the harmonic mean between sensitivity and PPV, of SNP calling in 17 inbred sorghum lines and 4 inbred rice lines.2. Materials and methods2.1. Software detailsWe designed Heap to identify SNPs from short read sequences of diploid species. In Heap analysis, short read sequences must be aligned to reference genome sequences in advance, and information on aligned reads, which is stored in either Sequence Alignment/MAP (SAM) format files or the binary version of SAM (BAM) format files7, must be employed (Fig. 1A). Workflow of Heap algorithm.Workflow of Heap algorithm.After importing information on read alignments from a SAM or BAM file, Heap performs read filtering to obtain high quality reads (Fig. 1B). By default setting of Heap, reads with a phred scaled mapping quality score (MAPQ) below 20 are removed. Bases with a phred scaled quality score in base calling below 13 are also eliminated from the search scope of valid SNP sites. Heap also trims both ends of each read before mining SNPs, because it is empirically observed that these regions contain many base calling errors. By default setting, both ends with n = 2bp are not counted for SNP searches. Moreover, flanking regions within i = 5bp of each INDEL site are also removed in SNP calling. To determine the default setting of the n and i values, we examined the empirical distribution of F-scores under multiple conditions (for F-scores, see Performance comparison among SNP calling tools with RAD-seq reads in sorghum in results and discussions) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The highest F-score was obtained under around n = 2–3, while F-score reached a plateau under around i = 4–5. Therefore, we determined that n = 2 and i = 5 as default values.Next, Heap determines each sample's genotype in every site that passes quality filtering (Fig. 1C). On each nucleotide site, the allele frequency is calculated from the number of nucleotide bases (A, T, C or G) aligned on it. Heap ignores any sites with three or more allele variants, since any allele possibilities above 2 on diploid organisms are likely due to sequencing errors. To determine the zygosity of each allele, a binomial test with allele frequency is performed (the null hypothesis H0: the allele is heterozygous). When the P value of the binomial test is <0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected thus the zygosity on the site is determined as homozygous. Conversely, when the P value is =0.05 and the minor allele is supported by two or more NGS reads, the zygosity is determined as heterozygous. When neither is the case, the genotype is included in subsequent analyses as missing genotype (./.). This genotyping step is repeated for all samples.Heap then performs SNP calling by comparing the genotypes between the sample (e.g. an inbred line) and the reference genome (Fig. 1D). The information on all SNPs between the sample and the reference genome is stored in a Variant Call Format (VCF) file. In a VCF file, reference allele, first alternative allele, second alternative allele, and missing is presented as ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘.’ in the genotype field, respectively. Finally, to determine SNPs among all samples, the VCF files for all samples are merged in a single VCF file by BCFtools (Fig. 1E).Heap is implemented in C ++ programming languages and is able to be installed on a Linux/UNIX-like operating system including, but not limited to, CentOS, Ubuntu and Mac OS X. The following additional software and libraries are required: Boost C ++ libraries, BCFtools (= ver. 1.2), HTSlib (= ver. 1.2), and g ++ compiler (= ver. 4.1.2). All steps of Heap algorithm can be invoked with a single command line. For the usage and options of Heap, see the README text file. Heap is released under the GNU General Public License Version 3 (see the COPYING text file).2.2. Wet lab proceduresDNA samples were extracted from 17 inbred lines of Sorghum bicolor (GULUM ABIAD, A-6129, AGIRA, LR 399, CRIOLLO CABEZA APRETADA, B2AR3043, RTx430, B3Tx2817, ZIRA-EL-SABI, ITALIAN, CAPRICORN, SOR 1, 15065, SAP-155, RCV, SC 56, and SIL-05) and 4 inbred lines of Oryza sativa (Omachi, Yamada Nishiki, Hitomebore, and Kameji). Methods of DNA extraction are described in Supplementary Methods.We performed RAD-seq in the 17 inbred sorghum lines using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 100 cycles with single end layout. Detailed methods for DNA libraries construction and RAD-seq are described in Supplementary Methods. These RAD-seq data have been submitted to DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) (DRR045054-DRR045070).WGS sequencing was performed in the 17 inbred sorghum lines using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 100 cycles with paired end layout. Detailed methods for DNA libraries construction and WGS sequencing are described in Supplementary Methods. These WGS sequencing data have been submitted to DRA (DRR045071-DRR045087).We performed RAD-seq in the 4 inbred rice lines using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 50 cycles with single end layout. Detailed methods for DNA libraries construction and RAD-seq are described in Supplementary Methods. These RAD-seq data have been submitted to DRA (DRR045088-DRR045091).Besides the sequencing data mentioned above, WGS sequencing data of the 4 inbred rice lines (DRR000719, DRR000720, DRR003652, DRR003655, DRR004451, DRR004452, DRR004453, DRR003648, DRR003649, and DRR003658) were downloaded from DRA. Each of them corresponds to each of 4 inbred lines mentioned in RAD-seq of rice.2.3. BenchmarkingIn order to correctly map the WGS sequencing reads and the RAD-seq reads to the reference genome sequences, we performed adapter trimming and quality filtering as described previously17. After quality control by FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ (29 March 2017, date last accessed)), we trimmed adaptor sequences by cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ (29 March 2017, date last accessed)). Low-quality reads were also filtered out by an empirically optimized custom Perl script as the following: (i) both ends of each read must have QV =10 (if not, the end base with QV <10 is trimmed away until QV =10 is exposed); (ii) each read must have average QV =17 (if not, the read is discarded); (iii) final length of each read must be =20 bp (if not, the read is discarded); (iv) each read must have low-quality positions (QV <10) no more than 10% of final length (if not, the read is discarded); and (v) each read must not contain any N bases (if not, the read is discarded). The Perl script for filtering out low-quality reads are available from our website (http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/lab/en/download/readPreprocessingScripts.tar.gz (29 March 2017, date last accessed)).We downloaded the genome sequences of S. bicolor (cv. BTx623) (Sbicolor_v2.1) and O. sativa (Japonica group, cv. Nipponbare) (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0) from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/ (29 March 2017, date last accessed)) and the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) (http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/ (29 March 2017, date last accessed)), respectively18–21. We aligned the preprocessed reads on the reference genome sequences using BWA with the default options. We then performed realignment of the reads of neighbouring INDELs using the RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner commands of GATK (with default settings). Finally, we selected uniquely mapped reads with the X0:i:1 and X1:i:0 tags in the optional fields of the SAM files.To compare performance of Heap (ver. 0.7.8), Stacks (ver. 1.29), SAMtools/BCFtools (ver. 1.1), and GATK (ver. 3.2) under similar conditions, we called SNPs with RAD-seq reads as follows.Analysis with Heap, Stacks and GATK, SNPs supported by 3 or more reads were used. In SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK analysis, SNPs with low genotype quality scores (GQs) (GQ <13) were excluded.In Heap analysis, we executed ‘heap’ command with the parameter of a minimum read depth (-d 3). Consequently, Heap provides an SNP list, which contains SNPs between samples.In Stacks analysis, to obtain SNPs between samples, we executed by the pipeline via the ref_map.pl. To obtain SNPs supported stacks, we executed the ref_map.pl with the parameter of a minimum stack depth (-m 3). SNPs sites were obtained by the ‘populations’ command of Stacks in VCF format.In SAMtools/BCFtools analysis, we ran the ‘mpileup’ command of SAMtools and the ‘call’ command of BCFtools. To describe GQs in FORMAT fields of the VCF file for subsequent filtering, the ‘call’ command was performed with the format fields parameter (-f GQ).In GATK analysis, for each sample, we obtained genotypes at all nucleotide sites by the ‘HaplotypeCaller’ command. This command provides genotypes for all sites in Genomic VCF (gVCF) format, therefore, it contains both homozygous and heterozygous SNPs in each site. We then created a VCF file containing information of all SNPs between samples, which was integrated with all gVCF files by the ‘GenotypeGVCFs’ command using the default parameters.To compare the SNPs derived by the multiple tools, we filtered the SNP sites, because conditions of SNP calling are different between Stacks and the other three tools (SAMtools/BCFtools, GATK, and Heap). Stacks calls SNPs at only nucleotide sites containing more than one allele among multiple samples. On the other hand, SAMtools/BCFtools, GATK, and Heap call SNPs at nucleotide sites containing one or more alternative alleles among multiple samples. For example, in three samples, a site containing genotypes ‘0/1’, ‘0/1’, and ‘./.’, is reported by the four tools. On the other hand, a site containing genotypes ‘1/1’, ‘1/1’, and ‘./.’, is not reported by Stacks but reported by the other tools. To equalize the conditions of the SNP lists derived by the multiple tools, we selected polymorphic SNP sites which contained 2 or more genotypes with more than one allele among samples, from the VCF files by a custom AWK script (http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/lab/en/download/awkScriptToExtractPolySNPsitesFromVcf.sh (29 March 2017, date last accessed)).To determine if genotypes obtained from the low coverage RAD-seq reads are correct or not at each nucleotide site, we determined more probable genotypes as ‘definitive answer genotypes’ by using the high coverage WGS sequencing reads. In order to establish the definitive answer genotypes at each nucleotide site in each sorghum and rice line, we aligned WGS sequencing reads to the reference genome sequences and determined the definitive answer genotypes stringently at each nucleotide site with the aligned WGS sequencing reads (Fig. 2A).

(C) Definitions of sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and F-score for SNP calling.After adapter trimming and quality filtering, we aligned the WGS sequencing reads to the reference genome sequences by using BWA. We obtained bases of the mapped WGS sequencing reads using the mpileup command of SAMtools. To ensure the high-quality calls from accurately mapped reads, we used the MAPQ 20 and the minimum base quality 20 for the mpileup command. Additionally, to obtain bases that had sufficient read coverages from the mpileup result, nucleotide sites supported with 20 or more reads were extracted by the awk command (awk -F '\t' '{if($4 > =20){print $0}}'). We counted reads for each nucleotide base (A, T, G, or C) and calculated frequencies of the nucleotide bases at each nucleotide site using custom Perl scripts. We then determined each genotype according to the following rigorous conditions: (i) when the major allele frequency is = 0.95, the genotype is homozygous; (ii) when the major allele frequency is = 0.5 and = 0.6, the genotype is heterozygous; (iii) otherwise, the genotype is not available (NA). Finally, we filtered out the monomorphic sites, which contained a single genotype among samples. A shell script and Perl scripts for making definitive answer genotypes are available from our website (http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/lab/en/download/benchMarkingScripts.tar.gz (29 March 2017, date last accessed)).3. Results and discussionTo compare the sensitivities and PPVs of SNP calling for Heap, Stacks, SAMtools/BCFtools, and GATK with low read coverage, we detected SNPs using low coverage RAD-seq reads by the tools in two plant species, sorghum and rice. Sensitivities and PPVs of the SNPs were calculated by comparing the SNPs detected with RAD-seq reads, and SNPs rigorously detected by a conventional strategy with more than adequate amounts of WGS sequencing reads, i.e. definitive answer genotypes. Then, we calculated the F-score, which represents a total performance index for sensitivity and accuracy of SNP mining.3.1. Genotyping with WGS sequencing reads for the ‘definitive answer genotypes’Firstly, to establish the ‘definitive answer genotypes’, we aligned the WGS sequencing read to the reference genome sequences in sorghum and rice. An overview of the preprocessing and the mapping for the WGS sequencing reads are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Averages of the WGS read coverages were 21.5 and 38.5 in the 17 sorghum lines and in the 4 rice lines, respectively. These read coverages (around 20–40) should be sufficient to perform definitively accurate genotyping12. Subsequently, we conservatively determined the definitive answer genotypes at each nucleotide site. In average, 4,045 SNP sites and 2,955,720 non-SNP sites were obtained in sorghum; 122 SNP sites and 2,779,362 non-SNP sites were obtained in rice. These results indicated that the number of non-SNP sites was very larger than the SNP sites. In this situation, specificity shows a large value, and is not informative value. In fact, all specificity values were over than 0.999 in this study (data not shown). Therefore, we adopted PPV to examine rate of precisely called SNPs in all SNPs.

Statistical analysis was performed using the Tukey-Kramer HSD test. Letters above the bars indicate groups that are significantly different (P < 0.05).With the aim of conducting a fair benchmarking for each tool, we also conducted GQ filtering-free analyses of SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK. The results showed that their sensitivities increased (SAMtools/BCFtools: 0.925, GATK: 0.686), but PPVs decreased (SAMtools/BCFtools: 0.843) or did not change considerably (GATK: 0.937) in the GQ filtering-free condition (Fig. 3). Importantly, Heap still showed the highest F-score (0.918) in this benchmarking, while the F-scores of GQ filtering-free SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK were 0.882 and 0.792, respectively. These results demonstrated that Heap is the best performance tool for SNP calling from RAD-seq reads, showing sufficient sensitivity and accuracy among the 17 inbred sorghum lines.3.3. Performance comparison among SNP calling tools with RAD-seq reads in riceTo confirm the advantages of Heap with multiple datasets, we also compared performances of the 4 tools in 4 inbred lines of rice, Omachi, Yamada Nishiki, Hitomebore, and Kameji. Prior to the SNP calling, we conducted RAD-seq and reference mapping of the RAD-seq reads (Table 4). The average RAD-seq read coverage in RAD-regions was low (9.7) for conventional SNP calling. We detected 842, 1,021, 437 and 242 SNP sites among the 4 rice lines using Heap, Stacks, SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK with the RAD-seq reads, respectively. Again, we calculated sensitivities, PPVs, and F-scores as mentioned above. Heap showed a high sensitivity (0.803) (Fig. 4) with a sufficiently high PPV (0.722). Here we would mention that although Stacks showed the highest sensitivity (0.843), the sensitivities of Heap and Stacks were not significantly different, according to the Tukey-Kramer HSD test (Fig. 4). Additionally, the PPV of SNPs detected by Heap (0.722) was higher than that by Stacks (0.553). Importantly, the F-score of Heap (0.757) was the highest among the tools examined. These results indicate that Heap calls SNPs with a high sensitivity and high PPV with a reasonable balance between them in rice samples, too.

Performance comparison among SNP calling tools with high read coverages in sorghumTo assess the performance of Heap even with high read coverage, we identified SNPs with WGS sequencing reads among the 17 inbred sorghum lines by Heap, SAMtools/BCFtools, and GATK, and benchmarked them in sensitivities, PPVs, and F-scores. We did not adopt Stacks in this test, because Stacks is incompatible with WGS sequencing reads. As a result, we detected 6,153,145, 5,160,730 and 5,587,400 SNP sites using Heap, SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK, respectively. The results showed that Heap had a high F-score of 0.9949, which was not significantly different from the highest F-score of SAMtools/BCFtools (0.9952) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Compared to the F-scores under low read coverage, the F-scores of SNPs detected by SAMtools/BCFtools and GATK turned out to be considerably high (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Also in Heap’s case, the more read coverage available, the higher the F-score achieved. This result reconfirms the importance of read coverage for accurate SNP calling. However, surprisingly, the F-scores of SNPs detected by Heap with the high read coverage were not substantially different from that of low read coverage (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). These results demonstrate that Heap is applicable not only to SNP calling with high read coverage but also to that with low read coverage, with fairly high performance.3.5. Scope of HeapIn this study, Heap exhibited the highest F-score in SNP calling with low read coverage when compared with the conventional tools. Heap will contribute to reducing costs of work requiring the identification of many SNP markers among multiple samples, such as with GWAS and GP studies. Heap also demonstrated sufficiently high performance compared to the other tools in situations with high read coverage.3.6. ConclusionIn GWAS and GP studies, a large number of SNP markers are required to detect associations between SNP markers and phenotypes. On the other hand, false positive SNPs would disturb precise association or prediction. In this study, we have developed a new tool Heap. In the low read coverage condition, we demonstrated Heap’s advantages in sensitivity and PPV by calculating and benchmarking F-scores of SNPs as long as the sorghum and the rice datasets were used. Therefore, Heap would offer fairly reliable SNPs with special reference to GWAS and GP studies. As genomic information becomes available in many species22–25, their SNP information serves as a useful platform on comparative functional analyses. In the future, we will be maintaining and updating the function for SNP mining in Heap.Availability of data and programThe datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the DDBJ DRA repository (http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/dra/index_e.html (29 March 2017, date last accessed)), under accession numbers DRR045054-DRR045091.

To investigate genetic variants leading to changes in root system architecture, 405 oilseed rape cultivars were genotyped with a 60K Brassica Infinium SNP array in low and high P environments. A total of 285 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with root system architecture traits at varying phosphorus levels. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms corroborate a previous linkage analysis of root system architecture quantitative trait loci in the BnaTNDH population. One peak single-nucleotide polymorphism region on A3 was associated with all root system architecture traits and co-localized with a quantitative trait locus for primary root length at low phosphorus. Two more single-nucleotide polymorphism peaks on A5 for root dry weight at low phosphorus were detected in both growth systems and co-localized with a quantitative trait locus for the same trait. The candidate genes identified on A3 form a haplotype ‘BnA3Hap’, that will be important for understanding the phosphorus/root system interaction and for the incorporation into Brassica napus breeding programs.1. IntroductionThe demand for oilseed rape (Canola; Brassica napus L.) as a food and fuel crop has increased global production to 24.6 Mt yr-1 in 2013 (FAO 2013; http://faostat.fao.org/). Phosphorus (P) is critical in the production of oilseed crops, and with worldwide demand for P fertilizer rising,1 breeding P use efficiency into crops can be an effective strategy. Root system architecture (RSA) plays an important role in P utilization. This is due to low soil P mobility resulting in heteromorphic spatial variation within the soil, but also from variation in bio-availability due to varying soil pH, microbial activity, and colloid chemistry.2Improved RSA traits have been identified in Brassica which deliver greater resistance to P starvation.3 For example, under low P in B. napus3 and B. oleracea4 primary roots become shorter and lateral roots increase in number and length. In A. thaliana, quantitative trait locus (QTL) LPR1 (Low Phosphate Root 1) is mapped to a 36-kb region on chromosome 1 in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population.5 In rice (Oryza sativa), a major QTL for P uptake (Pup1) is mapped to a 150-kb region on chromosome 12 in an F3 near-isogenic line (NIL) population.6 The gene conferring the phenotype (PSTOL1) is attributed to this region, and is a protein kinase in this QTL region that acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients.7 In B. napus, a total of 62 signi<U+FB01>cant QTL for total root length, root surface area, root volume, total dry weight and plant P uptake at two P levels were detected in three independent experiments with a F10 RIL population under low and high P conditions. Two QTL clusters, uq.C3a and uq.C3b were identified as specifically for root traits and P uptake under LP stress.8 A total of 131 QTL are identified for RSA traits under low and normal phosphate supply using a ‘pouch and wick’ system and an agar based system. QTLs for root and shoot biomass co-localized on chromosome A3, and a QTL for lateral root emergence colocalized with chromosomes A4/C4 and C8/C9 in a doubled haploid population (BnaTNDH).3,9Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied to the genetic dissection of complex traits in crops, such as drought resistance in Oryza sativa10,11 and flowering time and leaf architecture in Zea mays.12,13 Compared to QTL mapping, GWAS can achieve a higher resolution of the underlying genetic loci and does not require a mapping population.14 A total of 40 SNP peaks were detected for symbiotic nitrogen fixation traits in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).15 Six SNPs were attributed to root efficiency of P uptake in traditional rice.16 Seventy-four significant SNPs associated with P-efficiency were detected in soybean (Glycine max).17 Candidate genes for P efficiency in Arabidopsis,18 rice11 and maize19 have been identified. GWAS has also been applied to the dissection of complex traits in B. napus, e.g. flowering time,14 seed weight and seed quality,20 seed oil content,21 stem resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum22 and seedling shoot ionomic traits.23Haplotypes comprise SNPs or other markers on the same chromosome that are typically inherited together with little chance of recombination.24 To understand the effects of allelic variation on seed oil content, 324 accessions of B. napus with favourable and undesirable haplotypes at = 15 loci were grouped into four classes.21 Other important haplotypes were discovered for resistance to Sclerotina stem rot in B. napus22 and P efficiency in soybean.17In the present study, an association panel of 405 B. napus cultivars was genotyped with the 60K Brassica Infinium SNP array. RSA traits were investigated in ‘pouch and wick’ and hydroponic system experiments,9,25 under low and high P treatments. The aims of this study were (i) to determine the genetic diversity and RSA of the population, (ii) to investigate the genetics of RSA under high and low P, and (iii) to predict candidate genes associated with the genetic loci to (iv) reveal a favourable haplotype for breeding P-efficient B. napus.2. Materials and methods2.1 Plant materialThe association panel comprised 405 B. napus cultivars and inbred lines, including 342 semi-winter, 34 spring, 26 winter and 3 unknown types, collected from major breeding centers across China.21 370 lines originated in China, 20 from Europe, 5 from Canada, 4 from Australia, 4 from Korea and 2 from Japan (Supplementary Table S1).2.2 Phenotyping root system architectureThe root system architecture (RSA) of the panel was screened at low P (LP: 5 µmol l-1 P) and normal P (NP: 250 µmol l-1 P) using a modified standard Hoagland’s solution in 2013-14. The seeds were sterilized using 70% (v/v) ethanol and NaOCl (2.5% active chlorine), and then germinated on gauze with pure water for three days. The seedlings were transplanted to a hydroponic growth tank and grown for the first week with a 25% standard Hoagland’s solution, and then with a 50% standard Hoagland’s solution followed by a 100% standard Hoagland’s solution for a further five days. After 12 days the primary root length (PRL) was measured by a ruler. Seedling samples were dried at 80 °C for seven days for dry weight measurements (shoot dry weight - SDW; root dry weight - RDW). The panel was also screened at LP (LP: 0 µmol l-1 P) using a modified Hoagland’s solution whereby the KH2PO4 was replaced with KCl. The seedlings were grown using a ‘pouch and wick’ system,26 adapted by Thomas.25 Briefly, this method comprises growth pouches composed of germination paper down with the seedling growing between sheets of black polythene, the pouch is hung in a tank and suspended in nutrient solution, and each tank can accommodate 96 pouches (192 seedlings, one on each side of the paper). For each line, 16 seeds were sown across eight independent replicates distributed across four different aluminium frames. The nutrient solution was changed every 3 days. The RSA of samples were imaged at 14 days as previously.25 The RSA including PRL (primary root length), LRN (lateral root number), MLRL (mean lateral root length = LRL/LRN), LRL (lateral root length), TRL (total root length = PRL + LRL) and LRD (lateral root density = LRN/PRL) was measured using RootReader 2D (http://www.plantmineralnutrition.net/rr2d.php). Shoot and root samples were dried at 80 °C and dry weights (shoot, SDW; root, RDW) were determined (Supplementary Fig. S1).2.3 Data analysisRestricted maximum likelihood (REML) procedures were used to estimate line means and sources of variation in root traits.9,25 Means were estimated using the [Genotype] term as a fixed factor, retaining [(Replicate/Side of paper/Tray/Frame/Room)] as random factors.3 Random terms and no defined fixed factor were used to estimate sources of variation. Statistical analysis was completed using GenStat15th Edition (VSN International, Oxford, UK).2.4 Genotyping of the association panel and in silico mapping of SNPsFour young leaves from different individuals of each variety were planted in Wuhan and were sampled. DNA was extracted using a modified CTAB method27 and then adjusted to 50 ng µl-1. The 60K Brassica Infinium SNP array was employed and the SNP data were analyzed using Illumina BeadStudio (Illumina Inc. San Diego, California, USA).14,20,21 The SNPs with call frequencies > 0.8 or minor allele frequencies (MAF) > 0.05 and homozygous genotype frequency > 0 were selected for association mapping analysis.20 The physical position of the SNPs was identified by aligning the sequence of a 50 bp SNP probe attached to each SNP with the genome sequences of B. napus28 using local BLASTn (BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). If the SNP probe matched two or more locations in the reference genome, the SNPs were regarded as non-specific markers and abandoned.202.5 Population structure, relative kinship and linkage disequilibrium analysis of the association panelThe population structure was estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo model (MCMC) in STRUCTURE V. 2.3.4.29,30 Each K value (the number of real populations) was obtained with five independent runs with a putative number of populations set from 1 to 10, based on a model for admixture and correlated allele frequencies. The length of the burn-in period and number of MCMC replications after burn-in were each set to 100,000. Based on the rate of change in log probability of the data (LnP(D)) and an adhoc statistic <U+0394>K between successive K values, the true K value was determined.3 The Q matrix, which integrates the cluster membership coefficient matrices of replicate runs from STRUCTURE, was determined using CLUMPP (http://www.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/clumpp.html). Genetic distances among varieties were calculated by PowerMarker version 3.25 (http://statgen.ncsu.edu/powermarker/downloads.htm). Based on the analysis of molecular variance, AMOVA, the subgroup differentiation, pairwise FST, was measured using ArlequinV. 3.5.2.2 (http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin35/). After double centering, distance matrices were used to obtain ‘eigenvectors’ in NTSYS V. 2.2 (http://www.exetersoftware.com/cat/ntsyspc/ntsyspc.html). The relative kinship matrix was calculated by SPAGeDi (http://ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/SPAGeDi.html) when all negative kinship values between two individuals were set to 0. The polymorphism information content (PIC) and gene diversity of the SNP markers were estimated using PowerMarker version 3.25 (http://statgen.ncsu.edu/powermarker/). The parameter r2 between each pair of markers was used to estimate the linkage disequilibrium (LD) using TASSEL V. 4.0.142.6 Genome-wide association analysis of RSA traitsPopulation structure and kinship were used to correct for spurious association created by genotype-phenotype covariance. GLM (generalized linear model) and mixed linear model (MLM) calculations were performed in TASSEL to determine the best model for association analyses. The GLM included a naïve model without controlling for population structure, and the Q model which controlled for population structure using the Q matrix to identify populations. The MLM included the K model which assesses inter-individual relative kinship using the kinship matrix obtained in SPAGeDi software, and the Q + K model which controlled for population structure with the Q matrix, and kinship with the kinship matrix. Quantile–quantile plots were created with a negative log10 (P) value of the expected P-value from the genotype–phenotype association and the expected P-value from the assumption that no association exists between genotype and phenotype. The threshold of significance was set to P < 5.15 × 10-5 (1/total SNPs used).222.7 Differential expression genes underlying the QTL and significant SNP lociThe B. napus cultivar ‘Eyou Changjia’ were planted at normal P (250 µmol l-1) for ten days, and then half of the plants were transferred to a nutrition solution with zero P (0 µmol l-1) for five days. The shoot (S) and root (R) tissues of three plants at normal P and zero P were separated and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C. The sequencing libraries of twelve RNA samples: S1_LP, S2_LP, S3_LP, S1_NP, S2_NP, S3_NP, R1_LP, R2_LP, R3_LP, R1_NP, R2_NP and R3_NP, were generated using the Illumina RNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform with 100-bp paired-end reads. The B. napus reference genome was constructed using bowtie 2 (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA). Sequencing reads were aligned to the B. napus reference genome with bowtie2 and then assembled using TopHat 2.0.0 and Cufflinks.22 Gene expression was estimated using FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two samples were identified with Cuffdiff, based on criteria False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.01 and |log2 (FPKM_LP/FPKM_NP)|>2 (Ding, unpublished data).The QTLs for root traits previously detected in the Tapidor x Ningyou7 doubled haploid (BnaTNDH) population9 were explored for colocalization with SNP marker associations in the present study. The SNP markers flanking co-located QTL and SNP regions on chromosomes A3 were mapped onto the genome of cultivar Darmor-bzh, respectively. The intervals of a significant locus ranged from loci minus LD to loci plus LD. Genes/transcription factors which were located in the homologous physical regions of the reference map and previously identified as DEGs (differentially expressed genes) responding to high and low P in the B. napus cultivar ‘Eyou changjia’, were selected as putative candidate genes: BnaA03g05800D, BnaA03g05820D, BnaA03g05830D, BnaA03g05850D, BnaA05g22460D, BnaA05g22070D.2.8 Expression profile of putative candidate genes in P-efficient and P-inefficient B. napus cultivarsThe P efficiency of the varieties was evaluated using a P efficiency coefficient of the ratio of SDW under LP/SDW under HP.31 Two P-efficient (121 and 246) and two P-inefficient (292 and 453) varieties were selected for gene expression analysis of putative candidate genes. Plants were grown as above in the hydroponic system under a modified standard Hoagland’s solution for 10 days, and then transplanted to zero P for a further 5 days. Leaves and root were sampled and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for downstream RNA extraction. Total cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg RNA with RevertAid First Stand cDNA Synthesis kit (Cat No: K1621, Thermo Scientific, Lithuania, EU). Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The final reaction mixture for RT-PCR contained 10 µl SSo Advanced SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 2.0 µl cDNA, 1 µl primer and 7 µl distilled water. Real-time PCR was carried out in triplicate on each sample using Bio-Rad CFX Real-Time PCR System.22 Relative expression levels were evaluated using the 2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>CT method. Actin was used as an internal control for normalization. The relative expression of genes was normalized to the level of a reference gene BnPAP17 in the P- efficient cultivar (246) at low P.2.9 Geographical distribution of B. napus haplotypesThere were 21 significant SNPs for the RSA traits at LP, which formed a genetic cluster on A3 within a target QTL region. TASSEL version 4.0 was used to analyze the sliding window of LD on chromosome A3. The SNPs located in the LD intervals in the A3 cluster region were employed to identify the haplotype blocks in the accessions. The geographical distribution of haplotypes was predicted through a joint analysis of correlations between haplotypes and RSA traits, and origin of the panel varieties.3 Results3.1 Phenotypic variation in root system architecture at low and normal PExtensive phenotypic variation was observed in all traits under the two growth systems (Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, in the hydroponic system (HS) under normal P (NP) in 2013, mean values ranged as follows: SDW 0.086–0.834 g, RDW 0.0080–0.081 g, R/S ratio 0.023–0.213 and PRL 13.73–37.67 cm; and under low P (LP), SDW 0.063–0.213 g, RDW 0.022–0.065 g, R/S ratio 0.198–0.502 and PRL 23.02–42.05 cm. In the HS the RDW, R/S ratio and PRL were all greater at LP as compared with NP in both experimental years (HSI; HSII) (Table 1), and the coefficient of variation (CV) at NP was higher. In the ‘pouch and wick’ system (PS) experiment at LP, the panel phenotypes are shown in Table 2. All traits showed continuous variation with an approximate normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1).

A total of 30,976 matched to a unique location in the reference genome of cultivar darmor-bzh and 19,397 high-quality SNPs with MAF > 0.05 and call frequencies of SNPs < 0.8 (Supplementary Table S3) were selected to assess the population structure, relative kinship, LD, and to conduct association analyses. SNP number on each chromosome ranged from 482 on C9 to 2131 on C4. The density of SNPs on each chromosome ranged from 98.31 kb/SNP on C9 to 19.23 kb/SNP on A10 (Table 3). LD decay on each chromosome ranged from 8250 kb on C1 to 125 kb on A3, A4 and A6 when r2 was 0.2. SNP density in the LD region ranged from 4 SNP/LDchrA2 on A2 to 347 SNP/LDchrC1 on C1 (Table 3). The LD decay on the A genome, C genome and the whole genome was 1065 kb, 250 kb and 1100 kb, respectively (Fig. 1b). SNP density on chromosomes and in LD regions on the A genome were 27 SNP/kb and 35 SNP/LDA, respectively, on the C genome were 36.97 SNP/kb and 10 SNP/LDC, respectively and on the whole genome were 33 SNP/kb and 18 SNP/LDC, respectively (Table 3).

(e) Two subgroups of the B. napus panel when K equals 2.The population structure of the B. napus panel was assessed. The K values increased continuously with no obvious inflexion points of LnP(K) values (Fig. 1a). The <U+0394>K values indicated that the rate of change adhoc statistic was equal to 2, therefore the population could be divided into two clusters; Subgroup1 and Subgroup2 (Fig. 1e). The FST of Subgroup1 and Subgroup2 was 0.027 (P < 0.05). A total of 66 lines were in Subgroup1; 56, 3, 2, 2, 2 and 1 line(s) originated from China, Korea, Australia, Denmark, Germany and Sweden, respectively. A total of 339 lines were in Subgroup 2; 314, 2, 1, 2, 5, 9, 2, 2, 1 and 1 line originated from China, Japan, Korea, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Sweden, Poland and Denmark, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The LD decay distance in Subgroup2 (875 kb) was longer than in Subgroup1 (812.5 kb) and shorter than in the whole panel (1065 kb). Gene diversity of Subgroup2 (0.4010) was higher than in Subgroup1 (0.3847). The PIC in Subgroup2 (0.3175) was higher than in Subgroup1 (0.3057) (Fig. 1d). The Kinship coefficient of Subgroup2 (0.0697) was higher than Subgroup1 (0.0540). The r2 in Subgroup 2 (0.3452) was higher than in Subgroup1 (0.3122) (Fig. 1d).The relative kinships of the association panel were evaluated. The lines with kinship coefficients < 0.05 accounted for 67.9, 69.5 and 70.6%, and the lines with kinship coefficients equal to 0 accounted for 57.4, 51.3 and 62.4% in the whole panel, Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 2, respectively (Fig 1d), indicating that the majority of the accessions have a weak relationship with one another (Fig. 1c).3.3 Genome wide association mapping of RSAThe Naïve model, Q model, K model and Q + K model were used for association mapping. The deviations of observed values from the expected values were shown in the QQ plots (Supplementary Fig. S2) and were applied to select the most suitable model for each trait in the different experiments. Significant associations between SNPs and traits were identified by scanning the genome with a P < 5.15 × 10-5 threshold. In the hydroponic experiment I (HSI) there were 41 significant SNPs at LP and 9 at NP. Under LP; 7 SNPs for PRL were detected with the Q model; 4 SNPs for RDW were detected with the Q + K model; 6 SNPs for R/S ratio and 24 SNPs for SDW were detected with the Q model. Under NP; 1 SNP for PRL, 2 for RDW, 3 for R/S ratio and 3 for SDW were detected with the Q model. In the hydroponic experiment II (HSII), there were 31 significant SNPs at LP and 58 at NP. Under LP; 6 SNPs for PRL were detected with the Q + K model; 7 SNPs for RDW were detected with the naïve model; 6 SNPs for R/S ratio were detected with Q model and 12 SNPs for SDW detected with the Q model. At NP; 9 SNPs for PRL, 2 SNPs for R/S ratio and 37 SNPs for SDW were detected with the Q model; and 10 SNPs for RDW detected with the naïve model (Supplementary Table S4). In the ‘pouch and wick’ system (PS) 165 significant SNPs were identified at LP; 28 SNPs for PRL, 33 for RDW, 22 for R/S ratio, 32 for TRL, 5 for LRD, 31 for LRL and 7 for MLRL were detected with the Q model and 3 SNPs for SDW and 4 SNPs for LRN were detected with the Q + K model (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S4).3.4 Co-locating SNPs and QTLsNine significant SNPs detected with GWAS analyses co-localized with the intervals of the QTLs for the same traits in a previous linkage analyses of the BnaTNDH population,9 including one SNP on A3 for PRL, two SNPs on A5 for RDW (Supplementary Fig. S4a–c), three SNPs on A7 and C4 for SDW, and one SNP on A3 for TRL detected at LP; two SNPs on A3 for SDW detected at NP (Table 4). Therefore, the co-localized loci were detected for the same traits under the same P treatment in the two studies. The two nearly significant SNP markers on A5; Bn-scaff_16893_1-p69538 and Bn-A05-p18820057 at 16.76–17.25 Mb for RDW at LP, were detected in both systems employed in this study (Supplementary Fig. S4b and c). Moreover, there was a significant SNP marker Bn-A03-p3001467 at 2.49–2.72 Mb on A3 detected for all root traits measured in the PS experiment at LP (Fig. 2b–h). Bn-A03-p3001467 could explain phenotypic variation (PVE) of PRL (9.2%), LRN (6.0%), LRL (12.4%), MLRL (6.3%), TRL (13.8%), RDW (14.5%) and SDW (5.9%) at LP (Table 3), and thus was the main locus responding to P deficiency.

In the cultivar ‘Eyou changjia’, the relative expression of BnaA03g05800D and BnaA03g05830D increased, and BnaA03g05820D and BnaA03g05850D decreased, under P-deficiency in the shoot. In the root, the relative expression of BnaA03g05820D increased, and the BnaA03g05800D and BnaA03g05830D decreased, under P-deficiency (Fig. 2i).Two P-efficient varieties- 121 and 246 and two P-inefficient varieties- 292 and 453 were selected to measure gene expression of BnaA03g05800D, BnaA03g05820D, BnaA03g05830D and BnaA03g05850D by RT-qPCR. In comparison to P-inefficient varieties, the P-efficient varieties had a higher relative expression of BnPAP17 (BnaA05g22460D) in both root and shoot at LP. The relative expression of BnRACK1C (BnaA05g22070D) (Supplementary Fig. S5) was higher in the root at both P levels but lower in shoot at NP. BnaA03g05800D expression was higher in the root and shoot at both P levels, the relative expression of BnaA03g05820D was higher in the shoot at NP and in the root at LP, the relative expression of BnaA03g05830D was higher in the root at LP, and the relative expression of BnaA03g05850D was lower in shoot at LP (Fig. 3). This provides further evidence that the four putative genes were closely associated with P efficiency.

Eight successive SNPs located near SNP Bn-A03-p3052882 at 25.6 kb and the SNP Bn-A03-p3001467 at 75.2 kb formed nine haplotypes (Fig. 4g), designated ‘BnA3Hap haplotypes’. The varieties with haplotype 6 (GAAAAAGG) had higher average values in all the investigated RSA traits than those with the other haplotypes (Fig. 4a–f); two of the three varieties with haplotype 6 originated from European countries. Whereas, the varieties with haplotype 2 (AGCCGAGG) had lower average values in all of the investigated RSA traits than those with the other haplotypes (Fig. 5). Fifty-one of the 53 varieties with haplotype 2 originated from China. Haplotype 7 (GAAAACTA) was the most common haplotype (n = 183) and the RSA parameters of Haplotype 7 varieties were intermediate to haplotypes 6 and 2 varieties, respectively (Fig. 4a–f). The geographic distribution of the varieties was East Asia (285), Oceania (3), Europe (18) and North America (Canada) (4). Moreover, in China, the varieties distributed in Sichuan (10), Gansu (4), Shanxi (18), Hunan (17), Jiangsu (41), Chongqing (55), Hubei (131) and Qinghai (9) provinces (Fig. 5). Tajima’s D test of each SNP loci of BnA3Hap in B. napus indicated varieties from Gansu, Shanxi and Jiangsu provinces of China and Canada showed haplotype- BnA3Hap selection (Fig. 6).

The percentage of the varieties in a region accounted for in the panel is shown in the circle.The Tajima’s D values of geographical distribution in BnA3Hap haplotypes.The Tajima’s D values of geographical distribution in BnA3Hap haplotypes.The alignment of BnaA03g05800D, BnaA03g05820D, BnaA03g05830D and BnaA03g05850D in B. napus was identical to that of their orthologous genes in B. rapa, however, they differed from orthologs genes in A. thaliana. One gene was located on chromosome 3, and three were located on chromosome 5 of A. thaliana, suggesting hybridization between B. rapa and B. oleracea, while the BnA3Hap was conserved in the A genome (Supplementary Fig. S6).4 Discussion4.1 Genetic diversity, relative kinship and LDIn previous B. napus association panels, two subgroups were identified in 192 B. napus accessions32 and 523 B. napus accessions,21 but three subgroups in 472 B. napus accessions.20 In the present study, 405 varieties of the panel of Liu21 were used and similarly divided into two subgroups (Fig. 1). The LD, gene diversity, PIC, and relative kinship were slightly different between Subgroup1 and Subgroup2 (Fig. 1). As compared with European B. napus, the Chinese B. napus accessions studied had a more diverse genetic background (Supplementary Table S1), due to greater recombination in the A subgenome introduced through inter-specific hybridizations between B. napus and B. rapa. The LD in the C genome is greater than in the A genome (Table 3), but lower in PIC and gene diversity, indicating that the C genome may contribute more valuable alleles to adapt to different growth environments. In addition, the LD decay observed here- 1.06 Mb was different from previous B. napus panels, which observed 0.5–1 cM in 192 inbred lines,32 2.0 Mb in 472 inbred lines20 and 6.5 Mb in 523 inbred lines,14 and larger than that of other species, e.g. 100 kb–1 Mb in rice,33 1–100 kb in maize12 and 250 kb in Arabidopsis.34 The comparatively high resolution provided by association mapping is dependent upon the LD of genome.14 The low LD detected in this study indicated that this B. napus panel is suitable for association analysis and has the potential to identify SNPs in a narrow intervals equivalent to the distance of LD decay of 1.06 Mb. In addition, the number of SNPs, the length of LD decay, and the SNP density on each chromosome were different in this study (Table 3), similar to the studies with 52314 and 47220 accessions.In this study, we did not investigate the association between the population structure and the breeding history, as the cultivars in this panel lack breeding information history. The subpopulations in a panel of 70 tomato lines corresponded to historical patterns of breeding conducted for specific production environments.35 However, the population structure in a 472 accessions Brassica napus population showed only weak association with breeding history.36Structural variation of this B. napus panel was evaluated by gsrc, an R package for genome structure rearrangement calling.37 The C subgenome had more deletions and duplications than the A subgenome (Supplementary Fig. S7a). The number of CNVs in the region of ‘BnA3Hap’ was particularly low and therefore they have been not included in our association model. Genome structure rearrangements are a common phenomenon in allopolyploid species, which have been shown to affect phenotypic traits, and therefore it is of interest to monitor them on a genome wide scale in the future to detect further QTL. Subgenome C contains many CNVs and requires a deeper analysis to validate these and account for them in the association. For some regions (e.g. A10) CNVs were detected in the majority of lines in the panel and indicate a systematic effect.4.2 Candidate genes identified for RSAIn this study, only 9 out of 285 SNPs colocalized with previously identified QTLs for RSA traits, which can be attributed to three reasons. First, as compared with QTL mapping, GWAS can identify relatively higher resolution genetic loci from underlying traits because natural populations incorporate ancient recombination events. Second, RSA traits in the BnaTNDH population were screened at low and high P with a ‘pouch and wick’9 and an agar culture systems,3 respectively. RSA traits of GWAS population were screened using a solution culture system at both low and high P and a ‘pouch and wick’ system at low P. The growth conditions influenced genotypic ranking and the range of variability.38 Third, uncorrelated data may be the result different environmental parameters between experiments.The response of RSA traits to low Pi availability in B. napus has been well characterized.3,8 With low P availability, typically a reduction in the development of the primary roots occur,4,8,9 and increases the number and length of lateral roots are observed.3,35,LPR2 (At1g71040) was shown to regulate primary root development in Arabidopsis under low Pi availability. It is a paralogue of Arabidopsis LPR1 (At1g23010), which encodes a multicopper oxidase protein, which are essential for the reducing root growth observed when root tips contact low-Pi media.5,39 The RACK1 orthologous gene in Arabidopsis regulates lateral root formation by changing the sensitivity of the plant to gibberellin, brassinosteroid, abscisic acid, and auxin.40The genes associated with significant SNPs for root traits in the loci of target QTL were predicted to be the candidate genes for P efficiency. BnaA03g05800D, BnaA03g05820D, BnaA03g05830D and BnaA03g05850D were predicted to be closely associated with P efficiency, which were also located in the confidence interval of the QTL for primary root length at low P as well as the LD decay region of the peak SNP Bn-A03-p3001467 at 2.49–2.72 Mb on A3 (Fig. 2). All genes had significantly different expression in the P-efficient cultivar ‘Eyou Changjia’ between low P and high P (Fig. 2). The differential expression of the putative candidate genes in response to low-P stress was also confirmed in the P-efficient and P-inefficient accessions (Fig. 4). BnaA03g05800D in B. napus is orthologous to AT5G16010 in Arabidopsis, which encodes a 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase family protein that moves between various organs under normal or nutrient-limiting conditions.41,BnaA03g05820D is orthologous to AT3G02530 encoding a TCP family transcription factor.42,BnaA03g05830D is homologous to AT5G16110, which regulates lateral root development.43 Along with MEX1, the AT5G16150- plastidic GLC translocator (PGLCT) is essential for the growth and development of starch degradation products from chloroplasts and starch-mediated pathway for photoassimilate export in Arabidopsis.BnaA03g05800D, BnaA03g05820D, BnaA03g05830D and BnaA03g05850D had differential SNPs within the 5’ UTR or introns; the A/G alleles of lead SNP Bn-A03-p3073797 were located in the introns of BnaA03g5800D, A/C alleles of lead SNP Bn-A03-p3084593 were located in the introns of BnaA03g5820D, A/G alleles of lead SNP Bn-A03-p3091011 were located in the introns of BnaA03g5830D, and the A/G alleles of lead SNP Bn-A03-p3097703 were located in introns of BnaA03g5850D. These polymorphisms may cause differential gene expression between P-efficient and P-inefficient accessions (Figs. 3 and 4h). The characterization of the genetic elements associated with these traits could therefore provide elite alleles for the breeding of crops adapted to low P.4.3 BnA3Hap haplotypesBreeders have matched functionally different P-tolerance alleles to specific environments during selection. Oilseed rape was selected as a crop 300–400 years ago.36 In this study, the SNPs within candidate genes (BnaA03g5800D, BnaA03g5820D, BnaA03g5830D and BnaA03g5850D) on A3 formed a haplotype ‘BnA3Hap’, contributes to B. napus tolerance to low P stress (Fig. 4g and h). BnA3Hap haplotypes were detected at low P under the ‘pouch and wick’ system (Fig. 4a–f), and verified under the hydroponic system for two years. In addition, the Tajima’s D values of BnA3Hap haplotypes in B. napus varieties were strongly associated with the distribution of the agronomic P surpluses in soil44 (Figs. 5 and 6). Compared to ancestor species (B. rapa and A. thaliana), the order of the four orthologous genes of BnA3Hap haplotypes in A3 in B. napus showed collinearity with that in B. rapa, and were slightly different to that in A. thaliana (Supplementary Fig. S6), which indicates that this haplotype contributed to six RSA traits at LP (Fig. 4a–f) that were conserved during B. napus breeding. The discovery of the optimal haplotype of BnA3Hap can now enable the accurate selection of B. napus with higher P efficiencies and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying P efficiency in plants.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES Online.Conflict of interestNone declared.

IntroductionCodon usage bias (CUB) has been a wide-ranging field of research in the last few decades, revealing the importance of codons in many biological processes from cell physiology to the evolution of genes and organisms.1–9 A number of them are related to genic regulation,10,11 folding energy of mRNA secondary structures,12–14 mRNA stability,15–17 alternative splicing,18,19 miRNA–mRNA interaction,20,21 and protein aggregation or co-translational folding.22–27 Consequently, synonymous mutations affect significantly both gene expression and protein level, which are determinant steps in heterologous expression.28A number of traditional approaches have been widely used for the computational assessment of CUB based on measuring codon occurrence, such as Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU29) which is an index for evaluating the relative frequency of codons and determining when a codon is preferentially selected over its synonymous codons. The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI2), is another method used for determining the potential adaptability of a gene to a host genome based on frequency of codon usage. On the other hand, the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI5) is based on translation efficiency as measured by the codon–tRNA interaction, which calculates the optimality of a codon to the cognate tRNAs. This method has been broadly used to describe the ‘ramp theory’ of translation efficiency.30 Thus, many studies have been based on codon indexes to improve protein production through codon optimization in microorganisms.31–34 Nevertheless, the introduction of synonymous mutations has sometimes resulted in a decrease in protein production35 or loss of protein function due to instability, misfolding or aggregation.24,36,37 Contrary to earlier codon optimization studies, recent works have demonstrated enhanced protein production by insertion of rare codons,38 and, indeed, by random codon substitutions at the 5'-end region of genes.39Despite significant advances in CUB research, the understanding of the role of individual codons remains a challenging problem in the production of recombinant proteins,40 especially in yeast, where the limitations of codon optimization indexes have been reported years ago.41 We believe that this drawback is related mainly to a lack of integrated studies that could combine different approaches into one integral explanation of the effects of individual codons on protein biosynthesis. Although considerable advances have been made in accounting for the role of codons in certain processes, an integrated study is still required to explain the implications of codons at different biological levels and integrate them into a framework that could improve in depth the understanding of CUB and its basis in rational gene design.Another important question to be addressed in yeast CUB research is the determination of which codons are under evolutionary selective pressures at different positions in the genes. Recently, Hockenberry et al.42 developed a method of codon quantification which was implemented in the Escherichia coli genome to illustrate codon deviations from uniformity as a function of their position within genes. This approach is a major step to providing support for the ramp theory and codon selection at the 5'-end of endogenous genes. However, we observed that this method is not accurate enough for comparing codons at regions distant from the start codon. To overcome this drawback, we developed a method for quantifying all the genome regions based on a binning scheme of codon quantification relative to coding sequence (CDS) length. Thus, beyond the integrated scheme to evaluate CUB as a function of the position in yeast CDSs, the present study proposes the use of a different approach to the quantification of codons in yeasts using genome-scale data.Further, we examine various features of individual codons for five yeasts widely used in heterologous expression and value-added chemical production. We integrate the results to show the potential effects of each codon in protein biosynthesis, evidencing that position-dependent CUB is a governing rule over endogenous yeast CDSs. We show the interdependencies between the genome-scale frequency of codons and their optimality to translation efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate that there are very specific non-optimal codons that are, necessarily, uniformly distributed in intragenic regions of genes, while other kinds of non-optimal codons—having higher decoding times—are enriched at the beginning of genes and depleted in distant regions. Finally, we exemplify the potential impacts of individual codons in protein secondary structures. Taken together, our framework and the subsequent analyses present a meaningful advance in improving the basis of rational gene design for heterologous expression and yeast synthetic biology.2. Material and methods2.1. Criteria for yeast selectionBecause we were interested in analysing the CUB in yeasts related to biotechnological processes, principally as cell factories, we counted the yeast species names reported in the ‘Yeast biotechnology’ article collection (http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/series/Yeast%20Biotechnology), available in the Microbial Cell Factories journal edited by Prof. Diethard Mattanovich (last updated on 8 May 2015). The yeasts which were chosen for subsequent analysis were those with the most related publications. The yeasts selected were Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica.2.2. Genome sequencesThe genomic sequences of Kluyveromyces lactis (NRRL Y-1140: NC_006037–NC_006042), Pichia pastoris (GS115: NC_012963–NC_012966), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288c: NC_001133–NC_001148) and Yarrowia lipolytica (CLIB122: NC_006067–NC_006072) were obtained from the Fungi section of the NCBI ftp server (accessed in January 2015). The genomic sequence of Kluyveromyces marxianus (CCT 7735: CP009303–CP009310) and Escherichia coli (K-12: NC_000913) were downloaded from the Nucleotide database of the NCBI (accessed in February 2015).It has been demonstrated in previous studies that signal peptides (SPs) introduce a different bias of codon usage in the 5'-end gene region.26,43–44 Based on this, we decided to analyse CDSs containing SPs separately from those lacking SPs. Accordingly, the presence or lack of proteins with SPs were determined using SignalP-4.145 with the parameter t = euk for yeast sequences and, t = gram- for E. coli. Default values were used for other parameters.2.3. Characterization of codonsIn order to analyse the adaptation of each CDS to the codon usage of its respective genome, we used the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI2). First, the Codon Usage Table (Supplementary Tables S3–S7) of each genome was calculated by using the cusp function in the local version of EMBOSS suite v.6.6.0.0.46 Then, using the cai function of EMBOSS suite, the CAI was computed for each coding sequence with the correspondent codon usage table of its genome.The translation efficiency of a codon was obtained from the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI5), where codon relative adaptiveness (w) is the adaptation of a codon to the pool of available cognate tRNAs in the genome which incorporates the different possible tRNA and the wobble pairing rules. Based on reported methods,5 we calculated the values for K. marxianus and P. pastoris of the relative adaptiveness of a codon using CodonR including the parameters for eukaryotic microorganism analysis. The datasets of relative adaptiveness of each codon of S. cerevisiae were obtained from reported data.30 In the case of K. lactis and Y. lipolytica they were retrieved from a different experiment.27 When needed, tRNA counts were predicted locally using tRNAscan 1.4.49 As described by Pechmann and Frydman,27 codon relative adaptiveness (w) characterizes a codon as optimal if w = 0.4 or non-optimal if w < 0.4.2.4. Genome simulationsFor testing spatial deviation from uniformity in codon bias, 1200 complete genomes in total, 200 for each one of the 6 organisms in this study, were simulated. We developed an R script (SyMuGS—see Availability section and Methods Appendix for details) under the seqinr package51 to generate genomes containing coding sequences with the same codon usage, coding the same protein sequence as the original genome but scrambling the codon position in each coding sequence. This provides a robust null model to test the deviations of the original genome against the random distribution of codons in the simulated genomes.422.5. Quantification of position-dependent codon usage biasWe developed two R scripts (QuantiCUB and ExVar3D, see Availability section and Methods Appendix) under R/Bioconductor (http://www.R-project.org/) and Biostrings52 to count the codon occurrence under a relative-to-CDSs-length binning scheme (Fig. 1). We noticed that the codon quantification method proposed in a previous work42 is an appropriate approach to testing deviations from uniformity at initial intragenic regions but not to test subsequent positions, because of the exponential growth of the bin sizes in regions far from the start codon. When the codon position is more distant, the procedure becomes imprecise as regards retrieving codon quantification in regions in the intermediate and the 3'-end region of CDSs. Hence, it is not possible to keep codon quantification values in the same bin as they are part of different intragenic region of CDSs with dissimilar lengths. Thus, we decided to quantify the CUB by binning codons as a function of the position relative to the length of the CDSs. We integrated all the scripts developed into a toolset named ‘CodG: Analyzing codon positional dependency from genome-scale data’ (See Methods Appendix in Supplementary Material and https://github.com/juanvillada/CodG). Quantification strategy of codon usage bias by bins relative to coding sequences’ length. From each original genome, two datasets were arranged, the first including only CDSs lacking signal peptides, and the second comprising only CDSs codifying proteins with signal peptides. Then, for both datasets, all CDSs were divided into ten parts (bins) and their codons quantified and saved in bins (Observed Matrix). Synonymous mutations were introduced, conserving the original codon usage of the genome but scrambling codon positions within genes, thus generating 200 whole simulated genomes per yeast. Codons were quantified by bins as stated in the ‘Material and methods’ section, and a 3D matrix of 10 × 59 × 200 was generated in order to retrieve the expected value and standard deviation for each codon after codon position alteration.Quantification strategy of codon usage bias by bins relative to coding sequences’ length.

Codons were quantified by bins as stated in the ‘Material and methods’ section, and a 3D matrix of 10 × 59 × 200 was generated in order to retrieve the expected value and standard deviation for each codon after codon position alteration.First, the start and stop codons were removed from all sequences and, in order to maintain uniformity in the length distribution of the different CDS sequences between the five yeasts, sequences with less than 40 codons were excluded from the dataset (i.e. sequences excluded for K. lactis = 0.02%, K. marxianus = 0%, P. pastoris = 0%, S. cerevisiae = 0.7% and Y. lipolytica = 0.1%). Thus, following the results of a recent report,42 where it was demonstrated that no significant differences were detected when using different bin sizes, and guided by the result that shows ten as the best number of sections for visual exploration of the codon quantification, our method divides each gene into ten parts and saves the information of codon quantity per each tenth part of the CDSs thereby establishing ten bins with the same total number of codons. For each genome, the algorithm generated a matrix of 59 codons as rows (excluding the start, stop, and tryptophan codon counts) and 10 columns as bins.Finally, to test the effectiveness of our method, we used the E. coli genome as a positive control (Supplementary Fig. S2), comparing it to previous reports.42 As expected, comparable quantification values at the 5'-end were retrieved, and additionally, deviations from uniformity were detected at the 3'-end, a result which had not been observed by using a previous binning scheme.422.6. Test for uniformity in CUB2.7. Codon conservation in protein structuresTo understand how a similar CAI of a gene could affect translation optimization, we analysed the sites where codon categories are conserved in the structure of proteins in a similar way as that reported in the literature.27 We examined, as a proof of concept, two proteins conserved in the five yeasts which have similar values of CAI, but different expression levels under physiological conditions, namely, the elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1a) which is highly expressed, and the heat-shock protein SSE1 which has low expression level. We retrieved the protein homologous sequences from UniProt53 where available, or determined them by blast when not. The 3D structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank, 1F60 structure for EF1A and 2QXL structure for SSE1. The structures were visualized, and their colours were edited using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4 Schrödinger, LLC.). A multiple sequence alignment of amino acids and codons was formulated using ClustalW54 and edited in MEGA 655 in order to avoid gaps and maintain the integrity of the S. cerevisiae sequence as the model. The datasets P02994 for EF1A and P32589 for SSE1 from UniProtKB were used as a reference for the secondary structure motifs and 3D structural features.To test whether codon conservation in protein secondary structures is a generalized phenomenon, we used the data from the PDB web site database (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The files were retrieved by advanced search using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the organism source. The proteins were ordered according to their resolution and we recovered the 300 best resolution files (Supplementary Dataset S2—PDB IDs/SGDIDs). Then we removed the redundancy of these files applying the program VAST: Vector Alignment Search Tool.56 The set-up parameters were the P-value of 10e-7 and display of “PDB codes only”. The outcome was 138 PDB files/proteins tagged as non-redundant PDB data set (Supplementary Dataset S2—VAST). To automatize this process we used an in-house script (Struct_nonredund.cc, see Availability section).In the PDB file format documentation (http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format (January 2017, date last accessed)), there are only two secondary directly specified structures: Helix and Sheet. Thus, the analysis of codon proportion homogeneity within helix and sheet structures was performed by Chi-square test using two frequency tables, one for Helix (Supplementary Dataset S2—Helix) and another for Sheet (Supplementary Dataset S2—Sheet) created by our in-house C ++ script (Struct_frequencies.cc, see Availability section). Finally, we tested codon proportionality through a position-dependent scheme which analysed the occurrence of codon categories at the first, second and third positions within each protein structure using an in-house script (Struct_freq2.cc). Next, the same analysis was applied to the n - 2, n - 1 and n, where n is the last codon of each structure per protein. Finally, as in PDB documentation there is not a defined coil region, we performed the coil analysis using the regions which do not belong to Helix and Sheet coordinates present in the non-redundant PDB files. The chi-square tests were also applied to the data retrieved from the coil region, i.e. loops, which connects helices and sheets. The scripts used for coil analyses can be found in Availability section (Struct_freq2_coil.cc and Struct_freq3_coil.cc).2.8. Computation of mRNA minimum free energyTo evaluate the positional dependency of minimum free energy (MFE) in the mRNA secondary structures, we calculated the MFE in different positions of the genes by using the RNAfold program of the ViennaRNA package 2.0.57 The MFE was computed for all the CDSs of each yeast (nK.lactis= 5065, nK.marxianus = 4774, nP.pastoris = 5019, nS.cerevisiae = 5786, nY.lipolytica = 6413). Ribosomal genes from each yeast genome were used as a subset of highly translated transcripts.2.9. Statistical testsThe P-values (Figs 2B and 5A) are the probabilities related to the Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann–Whitney test), a non-parametric test for expected values with a two-sided alternative hypothesis for independent samples. For <U+03C7>2 calculations, we report the significance of each codon by a P-value < 0.00017 after a Bonferroni correction for 59 tests where P-value = 0.01 contrasting them with the <U+03C7>2 distributions with n - 1 degrees of freedom.3. Results and discussion3.1. Yeast cell factoriesThe metabolic diversity encoded in the yeast’s genome has led the scientific community to explore its capability at the industrial level as cell factories to produce value-added chemicals and enzymes. To determine the codon usage particularities in yeasts of biotechnological relevance, we used data mining to retrieve the most researched yeast species using as database all the articles in the collection of “Yeast Biotechnology” from the Microbial Cell Factories journal. It was observed that 104 papers, relating to 15 different yeast species, have been published in the last four years (Supplementary Table S1). However, most of them were limited to five species: Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica. It should be noted that there was an increase in the proportion of works published on non-conventional yeasts compared with the conventional S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Fig. S1). This being the case, we decided to work with the aforementioned five species.3.2. Strong signals of non-uniform distribution of codons relative to CDS lengthWe evaluated the positional dependency of CUB, integrating recent findings which state that gene expression levels in eukaryotes are shaped by CDS length and CUB,58–63 that also supported our scheme in order to overcome the drawback experienced by using a previous method,42 i.e. codon comparison between genic regions distant from the start codon. We decided to create a binning scheme based on the quantification of codons as a function of their relative position within genes and in relation to the length of their CDSs, forming ten bins by position (Fig. 1) to identify increased signals of deviations from uniformity [squared z-score from Equation (3)] as a function of the relative intragenic position.Previous studies have evaluated CUB, using bins with fixed lengths to analyse genes of both prokaryotes42 and eukaryotes.30 These studies reported that the 5'-end region presented unusual CUB behaviour. A detailed inspection of the results presented in the Tuller et al. manuscript,30 shows that the E. coli genome had substantial variation in standard deviations in the 3'-end of the averaged translation efficiency (as measured by the tRNA adaptation index). However, in a recent study, significant signals of deviations from uniformity (given by the z-score of the chi-square test) were not detected in the 3'-end of E. coli.42 Even though each is a different measurement of CUB, we would expect that, under a positional dependency approach, deviations from uniformity would also be significant at the 3'-end region as codons contribute differentially to the translation efficiency.We consider that this drawback may be due to the use of the fixed length of bins for deviations from uniformity computation, since the algorithm that uses the fixed length of bins is not capable of comparing the equivalent region of two CDSs (i.e. neither the middle nor the 3'-end) when the difference in CDS length is great. For example, if we have one CDS (CDS-A) with 200 codons and another with 100 codons (CDS-B), in a fixed configuration, we will be doing a comparison between the middle region of CDS-A and the 3'-end region of CDS-B which will give an inconsistent result. It is important to point out that our proposed binning scheme is aimed at overcoming this drawback.Bearing this in mind, we hypothesized that, based on the correlation of both CUB and CDS length, increased selection signals against the uniformity of codon distribution at different positions on the genes would be observed, taking into account the relative position of codons by gene, instead of an absolute pre-established quantity of codons per bin. In order to test this, we implemented our method and used published results42 as the positive control, drawing on research by authors who analysed the Escherichia coli genome and quantified high selection values against the uniformity of many codons at the 5'-end of the genes. As expected, by using our proposed codon quantification scheme on the same E. coli genome, we found comparable patterns of codon deviations from uniformity at the 5'-end (Supplementary Fig. S2). Nevertheless, it is important to point out that we also obtained significant deviations from uniformity in a number of codons at the 3'-end of genes, which had not been detected by the previously reported binning scheme. Thus, as shown in the positive control, our method allows for the detection of deviations from uniformity at both the 5'- and 3'-gene extremities.The strong selection against uniformity detected at both gene extremities contrasts with the absence thereof in intragenic regions (distant from the extremities) of the CDSs. Considering that selection forces on CUB are determinant features of protein biosynthesis,64 our proposed method is useful for describing the codon distribution patterns in endogenous genes and consequently further codon optimization. These results are explained principally by the accuracy of our binning scheme which is able to retrieve the same quantity of codons per bin, without binning bias at the 3'-, 5'- and all other intragenic positions. Therefore, our method exposes the differences, in terms of codon bias, between both ends and the inner regions of the CDSs, supporting recent findings described through ribosomal-protected footprint counts,65 where it was observed that codons have different footprint count distributions in a position-dependent profile, conserved along intragenic regions but divergent at the 5'- and 3'-end. Notably, a similar profile was observed when our genome-scale codon quantification method on the E. coli genome (Supplementary Fig. S2) and on five yeast species (Fig. 2A and B) was applied.

The positional dependency of the genome-scale CUB in yeastUsing our codon quantification method, which had been previously tested on the E. coli genome, we evaluated the position-dependent CUB in the yeast cell factory genomes. For this, a chi-square test per codon [Equation (3)] was conducted after filtering out the genes encoding proteins with signal peptides (SPs) in order to avoid biases attributable to their particular CUB.26,43,44,66 In a subsequent experiment, the same equation and methods were used to detect deviations from uniformity in the CDSs containing SPs. The occurrence of codons by bin was counted in the original (observed) genome and then compared with a null model formed by the expected value and standard deviation of 200 simulated genomes, where each genome conserved overall gene CUB but is produced with random codon positional distribution (see details in Material and Methods). This allowed us to determine the significance of the original CUB genome against a null model, calculating the squared z-score (deviations from uniformity) as a function of codon position and CDS length.Out of 59 redundant codons (Fig. 2A), we found 37 in K. lactis, 39 in K. marxianus, 14 in P. pastoris, 16 in S. cerevisiae and 50 in Y. lipolytica with significant non-uniform distribution in terms of their position (P-value < 0.00017, chi-square test after Bonferroni correction; Supplementary Table S2). These codons are highlighted with an asterisk symbol in Fig. 2A. Analyzing graphically the squared z-scores [Equation (3)] of the chi-square statistics, it was possible to observe greater uniformity deviations at both gene extremities, mainly at the 5'-end, and low values, close to zero, in intermediate gene positions. In addition, a Mann–Whitney test was applied because we were interested in testing the meaningful difference of the z-score distribution at the 5'-end bin to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between deviations from uniformity by position as a whole.Remarkably, using our quantification method constrained by the relativity of CDS length, the statistical test revealed that there are strong differences in codon selection against uniformity between the first part and subsequent position within genes. Moreover, when we tested the uniformity deviations at different positions within CDSs, we found significant differences (P-value = 0.002) between the first and second bin for all yeasts, except for K. marxianus in which higher significance was found between the second and third bin, although we found higher squared z-score values at the 5'-end of CDSs compared with K. lactis, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae. Accordingly, when we divided all the CDSs into an equal amount of parts (ten bins in this case), all yeasts had the highest deviations from uniformity at the 5'-end of genes. Furthermore, it should be noted that we found high squared z-scores at the 3'-end (Fig. 2A and B), suggesting that certain codons also present strong selection against uniformity at this extremity in agreement with the results obtained in a recent study.65 Consequently, the results reported here denote the contribution of individual codons to the generation of strong deviations from uniformity at the extremities of CDSs, showing how the ramp theory is also presented as a function of CDS length at the evolutionary level in yeast.3.4. Genome-scale signals of frequent codons with low optimalityBecause we were interested in determining the characteristics of frequency and optimality of the translation efficiency of each codon, we calculated two broadly used indexes: the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) using the codon usage table (CUSP) of each genome (Supplementary Tables S3–S7) and the codon optimality (w, formally defined as the codon relative adaptiveness) to the tRNA pool using published data,30 and when required, we predicted the tRNA counts (see Materials and Methods, tRNA counts in Supplementary Table S8). We used the RSCU values [Equation (1)] to characterize a codon as frequent or rare (Supplementary Table S9) and the codon adaptiveness (w) to characterize codons as optimal when w = 0.4 or non-optimal if w < 0.4 (Supplementary Table S10) in agreement with a previous study, in which w had been assessed in yeast genomes.27Based on principles of codon optimization for heterologous protein expression in microorganisms, we expected to observe a high frequency of optimal codons, and complementarily, a low frequency of non-optimal codons. Visual inspection of the frequency values (RSCU in Fig. 3A), reveals that they were very similar among K. lactis, K. marxianus, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae; however, the optimality of codons (w values) showed significant variations (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, we observed variations in Y. lipolytica in both codon frequency and optimality when compared with the other species. Intriguingly, we found for each genome heterogeneous correspondences between frequency/rarity and optimality/non-optimality. In contrast to the expected, we observed that several rarely used codons have optimal translation efficiency whereas frequently used codons have non-optimal translation efficiency. Heterogeneous correspondences between codon frequency and codon optimality metrics. (A) The values of the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) are shown here in order to characterize each codon in terms of frequency or rarity. Values near to the centre and inside the shaded region with black borderline are frequent codons, those outside the circle are rare. (B) Values of Codon Adaptiveness (w) to cognate tRNAs from the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) are represented to illustrate the translation efficiency of each codon. Points inside the shaded region, far apart from the centre of the plot represent “optimal” codons, opposite points near to the centre and inside the white region indicate non-optimal codons.Heterogeneous correspondences between codon frequency and codon optimality metrics. (A) The values of the Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) are shown here in order to characterize each codon in terms of frequency or rarity.

(B) Values of Codon Adaptiveness (w) to cognate tRNAs from the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) are represented to illustrate the translation efficiency of each codon. Points inside the shaded region, far apart from the centre of the plot represent “optimal” codons, opposite points near to the centre and inside the white region indicate non-optimal codons.From an evolutionary perspective, the evidence of codons which are frequently used but have non-optimal translation efficiency seems to indicate that there are selective pressures acting positively to conserve and use non-optimal codons, probably to guarantee the effectiveness of protein biosynthesis as elongation speed regulators. Therefore, we show that non-optimal and rare codons have different characteristics, and that optimal codons are different from frequent ones. Although they are referred to as synonymous in the literature,66 these characteristics of frequency and optimality could be positively correlated for certain codons but not in all cases. Optimality refers to the adaptation to the cognate tRNA isoacceptors and frequency/rarity refers to the occurrence of a codon in the genome. Mixed characteristics of frequency and optimality should be considered in detail because they are different approaches used in the characterization of individual codons which could impact several molecular processes. Subsequently, we decided to explore the features of individual codons in depth.3.5. Characterization between the Frequency and Optimality of codonsIn order to characterize the different correspondences between the frequency and optimality of codons, we decided to study each codon in an integrated framework (Fig. 4A) using the codon frequency and individual codon optimality for translation efficiency and then compare them to the data of the CUB positional dependency (Fig. 2A). It allowed us to define four categories for the classification of codons: (i) FreO, given by the intersection of high frequency and optimality; (ii) RareNO, given by low frequency (rare) and non-optimality; (iii) RareO, given by low frequency and optimality; and (iv) FreNO, given by high frequency and non-optimality. Integrated characterization of individual codons. (A) Each codon is characterized regarding its frequency and optimality. (B) Percentage of the four codon categories in the 59 redundant codons of each yeast genome.

(A) Each codon is characterized regarding its frequency and optimality. (B) Percentage of the four codon categories in the 59 redundant codons of each yeast genome. (C) The third-base composition of the four codon categories illustrates the differences between Yarrowia lipolytica and the other yeasts.Our integrated framework revealed the remarkable features of individual codons. For example, cysteine is coded by both the TGC and TGT codons, presenting uniform distribution with regard to the position within genes (Fig. 2A). In general, they have non-optimal adaptation to the tRNAs of each yeast genome (Fig. 3B), except for P. pastoris. In this yeast, the TGC codon is optimal for the tRNA pool (Fig. 3B); however, it is rarely used (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, codons of glutamine present a conserved non-uniform distribution as a function of the position within genes, possibly contributing to the formation of a selection ramp (Fig. 2A), with strong selection values against uniformity at the 5'-end in all yeasts. The CAA codon is frequent and optimal (Fig. 4A) for all the yeasts with the exception of Y. lipolytica, in which this codon is rare and non-optimal. In contrast, the CAG codon is rare and non-optimal in K. lactis, K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae, but frequent and optimal in Y. lipolytica (Fig. 4A). Another relevant feature is that, although CAG is rarely used and is non-optimal in the genomes of K. lactis, K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae, it is optimal in P. pastoris (Fig. 4A). Thus, this is a characteristic that is particular to P. pastoris. Correspondingly, P. pastoris has a higher quantity of codons that are optimal but rarely used (Fig. 4B), which seems to be an advantage for the production of recombinant proteins taking into account that these optimal codons, rarely used in the expression of endogenous genes, might be used more frequently in the expression of heterologous genes.On the other hand, it was possible to observe the different properties in the codon selection features found in the genome of Y. lipolytica (Fig. 4B) when compared with the other yeasts. Although it is broadly known that Y. lipolytica has a very different codon usage, this microorganism seems to be under strong positive pressure from optimal codons to use them frequently and, at the same time, a strong negative selection over non-optimal codons to use them rarely.Finally, we found important differences when comparing the third base composition of the four codon categories. Y. lipolytica presents very low content of AT3 in its frequent codons and high content in the rare ones. On the other hand, all the other yeasts showed high AT3 content of frequent codons and very low, or zero content, in rare codons (Fig. 4C). It should be pointed out that codon optimality seems to be an inaccurate characteristic to yeasts categorization considering the third base composition (Fig. 4C). It is important to clarify that data integration through this approach has been achieved by using genome sequences of microorganisms, which exhibit codon usage bias positively associated with translation efficiency. Therefore, the application of this method should consider these features before applying it to future research in non-translationally efficient organisms. Nevertheless, with the properties highlighted here it is possible to define the contribution of each codon in terms of evolutionary selection, translation efficiency and whole genome occurrences for each yeast cell factory. This integrated framework stands as a valuable tool that contributes to the improvement of knowledge on the different roles of individual codons in endogenous genes.3.6. Rare–non-optimal codons have higher decoding time and are enriched at the beginning of CDSsThe characterization of codons led us to address the contribution of each codon category to the protein elongation process. Based on this, and the following three main statements: first, codons are translated at different rates;26,50,65,67 second, we observed there are strong evolutionary selective pressures acting differentially on redundant codons to use them rarely or frequently; and third, codons are also differentially adapted to the tRNA pool in terms of efficiency, we hypothesized that it would be possible to find significant differences in the contribution of the four different categories of codons (FreNO, RareNO, etc.) to the kinetics of the elongation process.In order to test this, for each codon we computed the codon decoding time [CDT, Equation (2)] as described previously65 and subsequently we formed four clusters of codons according to the categories revealed by the integrated framework. Finally, we analysed the distribution of CDT values, a measurement aimed at addressing the time required to decode each codon.Confirming our hypothesis (Fig. 5A), rarely used non-optimal codons (RareNO) have significantly higher CDTs (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test) than frequent non-optimal (FreNO) codons, except in the case of K. marxianus. In this yeast, the statistical test was not significant. It should be noted (Fig. 5A) that certain RareNO codons of K. marxianus have CDT values higher than the highest CDT values of FreNO codons. However, there was no significant difference between the RareNO and FreNO groups in this yeast. This particularity could be due to difficulties in the w value computation used for calculating CDTs. Thus, it is expected that the future availability of K. marxianus protein expression data will allow for constraining the computation of their respective w values, which in turn will contribute to improving their CDT calculation. Codon decoding time (CDT), the average of Y-values and the mRNA free folding energy are presented to indicate the features of each codon category. (A) shows the significant differences found when CDT values of Rare–Non-optimal (RareNO) are compared with Frequent–Optimal (FreNO) codons. The translation rate is the slowest when decoding RareNO codons. No significant differences between the optimal ones (FreO and RareO) were found. (B) RareNO codons seem to be enriched at regions near to start codons in K. lactis and other yeasts (Supplementary Fig. S8), while Frequent–Optimal (FreO) codons contrast that profile. FreNO codons are not significantly enriched or depleted as a function of position within genes, they are uniformly distributed inside genes, probably to guarantee the accuracy in protein biosynthesis as translation speed regulators (see Supplementary Figs S3–S7 for individual values of codons per bin). (C) mRNA structure is the lowest in the 5'-end region, where RareNO codons are enriched. The MFE was computed for all the CDSs of each yeast (nK. lactis= 5065, nK. marxianus = 4774, nP. pastoris = 5019, nS. cerevisiae = 5786, nY. lipolytica = 6413).Codon decoding time (CDT), the average of Y-values and the mRNA free folding energy are presented to indicate the features of each codon category. (A) shows the significant differences found when CDT values of Rare–Non-optimal (RareNO) are compared with Frequent–Optimal (FreNO) codons. The translation rate is the slowest when decoding RareNO codons. No significant differences between the optimal ones (FreO and RareO) were found. (B) RareNO codons seem to be enriched at regions near to start codons in K. lactis and other yeasts (Supplementary Fig. S8), while Frequent–Optimal (FreO) codons contrast that profile. FreNO codons are not significantly enriched or depleted as a function of position within genes, they are uniformly distributed inside genes, probably to guarantee the accuracy in protein biosynthesis as translation speed regulators (see Supplementary Figs S3–S7 for individual values of codons per bin). (C) mRNA structure is the lowest in the 5'-end region, where RareNO codons are enriched. The MFE was computed for all the CDSs of each yeast (nK. lactis= 5065, nK. marxianus = 4774, nP. pastoris = 5019, nS. cerevisiae = 5786, nY. lipolytica = 6413).Additionally, the detection of higher CDTs conserved in RareNO codons seems to explain their low frequency in intermediate gene regions where the protein biosynthesis process should be highly efficient. This reveals that the decoding time of certain codons is a special feature that constrains codon selection, which explains why certain different non-optimal codons are used more frequently than others in yeast. Thus, we conclude that the insertion of RareNO codons in genes can facilitate slower protein elongation. In fact, RareNO codons introduce lower translation rates than FreNO codons, an important characteristic of note in the synthetic gene design.The results described above also led us to hypothesize that, whether the ramp theory applies to translation efficiency or not,10,30,67–70 we should consider these signals in terms of richness or depletion by codon category as a function of position within CDSs. Hence, a higher occurrence of RareNO codons should be expected at the beginning of the genes which will modulate the initiation of elongation. At the same time, we would expect its absence in intragenic regions where the elongation process must be more efficient. On the other hand, it is reasonable to consider that FreNO codons, which are equally non-optimal as RareNO codons, but have lower decoding times, should be found at different positions on the genes. It is probable that they act as elongation speed regulators for protein co-translational folding,22 and that elongation will not be slowed as much as when decoded by RareNO codons. To test this, we determined if the different categories of codons are enriched or depleted as a function of position in the ten bins. We calculated the Y-value [Equation (4)] as the ratio of observed (O) values to expected values (E) on a logarithmic scale, to determine the fold-change of observed codons against expected codon occurrences in simulated genomes with scrambled position of codons in their CDSs. The computation was carried out for each yeast genome (Supplementary Figs S3–S7).Interestingly, we found that RareNO codons are predominantly enriched at regions close to the start codon (Fig. 5B) and depleted in distant regions. In general, FreO codons are predominantly depleted at the beginning of genes. In agreement with recent data,30 we add important evidence to the theory of the translation ramp, with two remarkable additions: first, we suggests the existence of the ramp at the evolutionary level in yeast, and second, we found a specific group of codons (RareNO codons) enriched at the beginning of genes, which are responsible for the lowest translation rates. Moreover, we observed a conserving tendency in FreNO codons to avoid either enrichment or depletion. They were found uniformly distributed through the genomes of K. lactis, K. marxianus, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Fig. S8), but strongly enriched at the beginning of genes in Y. lipolytica, pointing out that this yeast also has the lowest percentage of FreNO codons in comparison to the other yeasts (Fig. 4B). Another interesting point worthy of note is that our finding related to the enrichment of RareNO codons in the 5'-end region of endogenous genes in yeast could be associated with the maintaining of a decreased local mRNA structure (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Dataset S1). A similar result has been described recently in E. coli,42 suggesting that rare codons assist to preserve reduced mRNA structure.In our work, the local mRNA minimum folding energy (MFE) at the beginning of genes showed the lowest local mRNA structure when compared with intragenic positions distant from the 5'-end region. Our calculation indicates that it is a conserved characteristic when applied to the whole gene dataset of yeasts and to the highly expressed genes such as ribosomal proteins. Accordingly, this observation among mRNA, MFE and codon positional dependency in yeast suggests a similar phenomenon, as determined experimentally in bacteria,71 where rare codons reduced the secondary structure of mRNAs. Therefore, our data reinforce, with novel genome-scale characteristics, the ramp theory of codon usage bias.10,30,70 Additionally, the aforementioned findings validate the existence of the ramp at the evolutionary level and allow us to specify which codons are really contributing to slower translation speeds, illustrating the orchestration of selective constraints, translation efficiency, codon occurrence, local mRNA folding energies and the determinant contributions of individual codons, especially the imperative leadership of non-optimal codons, to the protein biosynthesis.3.7. Genes with signal peptides use preferentially RareNO codons at the 5'-endSignal peptide (SP) design and its synthetic construction is an effective method used in industrial biotechnology to improve heterologous protein production and biocatalysis.72,73 Thus, investigation of the differential codon composition of genes with SPs has been an objective of various studies despite the different approaches employed.26,43–44 We used our integrated framework, to analyse the CDSs containing SPs for each yeast genome, by computing the Y-value (Fig. 6) and the deviations from uniformity (Supplementary Fig. S9). The codon positional dependency in genes coding proteins with signal peptide. The figure shows the analysis applied to the set of CDSs which have signal peptides. The Y-value (see Materials and methods) is reported graphically to illustrate the codon enrichment or depletion at different intragenic positions.The codon positional dependency in genes coding proteins with signal peptide. The figure shows the analysis applied to the set of CDSs which have signal peptides. The Y-value (see Materials and methods) is reported graphically to illustrate the codon enrichment or depletion at different intragenic positions.Because SPs are composed mainly of a hydrophobic core of amino acids74 such as glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), proline (Pro) and phenylalanine (Phe), we hypothesized that if translation efficiency controls the SPs, the aforementioned amino acids would be codified preferentially by the less efficient (non-optimal) codons, and then we would expect their enrichment in the 5'-end region of CDSs.In agreement with our hypothesis, it is possible to observe that in the first bin (Fig. 6) Leu is codified preferentially by CTG in K. lactis (Kl), CTG in K. marxianus (Km), CTC in P. pastoris (Pp), CTC in S. cerevisiae (Sc) and TTA in Y. lipolytica (Yl). Although they are different codons, all of them are RareNO codons. On the other hand, for the same amino acid, the most depleted codon is TTG in Kl, TTG in Km, TTA in Pp, TTG in Sc and CTT in Yl, which are optimal codons except for Pp that does not present optimal codons for this amino acid. In other cases, Val is preferentially codified by GTA in Kl, GTA in Km, GTG in Pp, GTG in Sc and GTA in Yl, being all RareNO codons. Phe is preferentially codified by TTT in Kl, Km and Pp, which is a non-optimal codon, and at the same time avoids TTC which is optimal in all cases; Sc and Yl do not present codon bias for this amino acid. Gly is preferentially codified by GGG in Kl, GGA in Km, GGG in Sc and GGG in Yl, which are all RareNO codons. Pp does not present codon bias for this amino acid, while Km, Sc and Yl avoid the use of the GGT codon which is FreO in all cases.Interestingly, a number of researchers reported significant improvement in yeast protein secretion when Arg was inserted exactly in the N-terminal of synthetics SPs74,75 and, as shown in Fig. 6, the amino acid with the highest bias (conserved characteristic among the yeasts) is indeed Arg. We checked the features of its codons and found that Arg is preferentially codified in the 5'-end region by CGG in Kl, CGA in Km, CGA in Sc and CGC in Yl, which are RareNO codons, while Pp uses preferentially CGC (RareO) and CGG (RareNO). Therefore, this is an important feature to be considered in experimental designs of synthetic SPs.In general, we observed in this study a conserved feature: amino acids that are part of the SPs are codified preferentially by non-optimal codons, most of them being RareNO codons. We also verified that this genic region is commonly depleted in optimal codons, demonstrating through this integrated approach, that positional dependency governs the codon arrangement in SPs, which seems to provide slow translation rates at the 5'-end and maintains the ramp of translation efficiency of genes,30 to guarantee co-translational interaction between SPs and the signal recognition particle.263.8. Codon category contribution to protein structure and the necessity of new optimization methodsProtein co-translational folding is one of the most important features of individual codons in protein biosynthesis.22,67,76,77 We analysed the relationships between different categories of codons and the protein tertiary structure, as well as important issues related to the use of the classical method of codon optimization such as the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI).We assessed in each yeast genome a conserved CDS with a similar CAI value, but with different protein expression levels under similar physiological conditions. In this way, we analysed the TEF1a (Translation elongation factor 1 alpha) and SSE1 (coding a heat-shock protein) genes which have similar CAI values in each host yeast genome (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, we performed codon multiple alignments as described in a previous study27 and then we considered the corresponding codon category and determined the levels of conservation among the 5 yeasts (Fig. 7B). We represented the codon-category conserved sites in the 3D structure of both proteins, which allowed us to illustrate conserved evolutionary types of translation efficiency and co-translational folding over two differently expressed genes, despite having close CAI values. Proof of concept on codon category contribution to structural features of two different proteins. (A) Similar values of Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) were found for the SSE1 (expressed as a response of heat-shock) and the TEF1a proteins (highly and constitutively expressed). As both present similar CAI values to their host genomes, and have very different expression rates in physiological conditions, they are an interesting example to test our concept. CAI, a commonly used index, seems to be a non-well fitted method for predicting expression levels of proteins and thus is not recommended for the secure optimization of yeast genes. (B) Method for multiple sequence alignment based on codons to determine the conservation of codon categories in coding sequences. If a codon category is conserved at least in four out of five yeasts then the codon is defined as conserved and its category is illustrated with its correspondent colour in the protein structure.

(E) Changes in codon category composition when both proteins were optimized by CAI algorithm. CAI optimization introduces silent mutations that could impact translation rates by insertion of FreO and FreNO codons.First, it is important to highlight that by using our codon categorization, a potential impact on essential structural features was uncovered. Our novel categorization scheme allowed us to identify patterns of conserved optimal codons in agreement with previous findings,27 but going beyond the categorizing of individual codons by optimality properties, the proposed method herein takes into account the fact that these optimal codons are also frequent codons in a genome-scale analysis. Thus, we observed FreO codons conserved in positions 1 and 4 from the helix start, and additionally, the enrichment of conserved FreO codons in the alpha-helices (Fig. 7C and D). One important point to be noted is the absence of FreNO conserved sites in the structure of the SSE1 protein (Fig. 7C), whose translation is low, but presents a conserved RareNO site at the beginning of the gene in the second codon/amino acid position. However, it was not possible to illustrate it in the protein structure due to lack of information of this amino acid in the original 3D protein model. In addition, it is important to observe (Fig. 7C and D) that even different codons, or indeed, when different amino acids are being coded, the codon category is conserved among the yeasts, suggesting the importance of the properties of individual codons to the conformation of structural features in proteins.In the case of TEF1a, a highly expressed protein, we found optimal (FreO and RareO) and FreNO conserved sites in important structural locations (Fig. 7D), such as the last position of beta-sheets and alpha-helices. It is reasonable to claim that this FreNO conservation provides the control needed over the protein elongation rate. It seems that the ribosome suffers a decrease in translation speed to retain inside its tunnel the previously translated amino acids in order to fold the structural motif. The conserved FreNO sites are found in general at ~20–30 codons downstream of complete alpha-helices or beta-sheets, fitting perfectly to the length of the ribosomal tunnel (~30 amino acids), the region responsible for protein co-translational folding.26,78,79 After they have been analysed, we focused our investigation on a more generalized perspective about the role of the four categories of codons in secondary protein structures.First, we hypothesized that codon features affect the translation efficiency of the ribosome, and assist protein secondary structure conformation. Therefore, we expected to observe that the secondary structures would be translated at different rates and their codon composition would not be equally distributed between the cluster of frequently used codons (FreO and FreNO) and the cluster of rarely used codons (RareO and RareNO). To test this, we retrieved 300 structures from the RSCB Protein Data Bank and filtered out the redundant ones, resulting in 138 non-redundant protein structures. Next, we evaluated the occurrence of the four codon categories inside all their alpha-helices, beta-sheets and coil regions (coil was assumed to be the regions which do not belong to helix and sheet coordinates in PDB files).We found that the codon composition of alpha-helices and beta-sheets is similar (~41% FreO, ~16% FreNO, ~18% RareNO and ~23% RareO; Supplementary Fig. S10A), also ~65% of the codons were optimal and ~35% non-optimal, suggesting that a substantial proportion of the secondary structures is translated slowly. Contrary, coil regions presented a notable difference in codon composition (Supplementary Fig. S10A). We observed that the composition of RareNO codons in coils was the highest compared with the other two structures, approximately 26% of its total composition. This result indicates that, at least for the proteins analysed, coils have numerous points with the slowest translation efficiency as determined by codon decoding times in Fig. 5A. Moreover, codon optimality distribution in coil regions is particularly characterized by an increased presence of non-optimal codons (~44% non-optimal and ~56% optimal; Supplementary Dataset S2).We believe that these observations are attributed to the dynamics of the protein elongation process. As an example, we consider a simplified part of a protein composed by a helix followed downstream by a coil. When the region corresponding to the helix has been already (optimally) translated, it would be fitted inside the ribosome tunnel where would occur the co-translational folding.26,78,79 Probably, the time required to take place this folding is provided by the decrease of translation rate in coil region, which would be associated to the presence of RareNO codons (enriched in the coil). Another possible explanation to this observation could be attributed to the evolutionary pressures that act over the sheet and helix structures, as they determine the correct function of proteins one will expect that these secondary structures tend to be adapted for efficient translation while coils could accumulate different silent mutations. This reasoning is still a theoretic approximation to the observations and further approaches should be applied to unveil the mechanisms behind these intriguing results. We suggest that synthetic optimization of codons in those structures should consider that changes in local translation rates could impact the protein co-translational folding and ultimately its function.Finally, we were interested in examining the codon composition at the extremities of the secondary structures which seems to be specifically under higher selective pressures considering the previous TEF1a/SSE1 inspection. To analyse the positional dependency of the structure-codon correspondence we studied the differences in the codon composition of the four codon categories at different positions. Because the secondary structures of proteins present a high degree of variation in length, we decided to constrain our analysis using the first three and the last three codon positions. Notably, the codon composition of FreNOs presented the highest increment in the first codon of helices when compared with the overall (Supplementary Fig. S10B). Although FreO codons are preferentially found at this first position (~39%; Supplementary Dataset S2), FreNO codons presented their highest occurrence (~21%) at this position when compared with all other positions. At subsequent positions (Codons 2 and 3) the FreNO composition is decreased and similar to the overall, in the third codon position FreO codons were found to be relatively increased. At the last position on the helices (Codon n), FreO codons decreased their occurrence and the non-optimal codons presented a relative increment. Also, we observed an increased occurrence of RareO codons (Supplementary Fig. S10A). In general, our analysis indicates that helices are relatively depleted in optimal codons at the first and last position of the structure (Supplementary Fig. S11).These results denote that the extremities of the helices, could serve as a transition point in the translation rate to start or terminate structure translation. This transition point in beta-sheets is characterized, in contrast to helices, by a decrease in FreO codons occurrence at the end of beta-sheets (Supplementary Fig. S10B), where FreNO codons are relatively enriched, and by a relative depletion of non-optimal codons at the beginning of the structure (Supplementary Fig. S11). In the case of the coil regions, we observed that the first three positions presented a remarkable enrichment of RareNO codons (Supplementary Fig. S10B), specifically, the position corresponding to the second codon presented the highest increment of RareNO codons in all the structures, suggesting that the translation at the beginning of coil regions is characterized by a very slow rate. Even though the occurrence of non-optimal codons in coil regions is mainly concentrated at the beginning of coils, we also found them increased at the end of the structure (Supplementary Fig. S11). Although codon overall composition of protein secondary structures seems not very dissimilar (Supplementary Fig. S10A), it is possible to perceive that the three protein secondary structures presented contrasting profiles in the extremities (Supplementary Fig. S11). In general, this intriguing outcome is a theoretical evidence that protein secondary structures could be ruled by the codon positional dependency like the observed properties of coding sequences at genome-scale, having potential implications in the understanding of protein evolution as well as biotechnological applications. However, this is an unexpected result and further research should be aimed at collecting more evidence on the transition points presence and the position-dependent translation efficiency coupled to the co-translational folding in inner regions of protein secondary structures.Although we have reported these correspondences between codon categories and protein secondary structures of 138 non-redundant proteins, we suggest that codon-structure correspondence analysis, aimed at heterologous expression experiments, should be performed on a gene-by-gene basis, to identify the codon category in relevant protein structures such as the N-terminus (which in helices seems to be generally enriched in FreNO and depleted in optimal codons) and the structural transition points. Accordingly, both optimal and non-optimal codons have molecular tasks important to cell development. Furthermore, the high complexity of individual codon contribution to protein biosynthesis in yeast cell factories should be considered in codon optimization.This reasoning led us to show the potential effects of traditional codon optimization methods such as the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) approach for optimization of genes. In our experiment (Fig. 7E), we obtained genes with a significant number of frequent codons which should not be considered as optimal; thus, it may be considered normal to obtain a sequence enriched in FreNO codons after gene optimization using the CAI. Then, these FreNO codons could affect protein translation elongation by decreasing the local translation rate and possibly generating unexpected protein qualities.Consequently, individual codons have different features that contribute in diverse ways to protein biosynthesis. It depends on several characteristics such as the selective forces that define which codons are enriched and depleted as a function of position, the frequency of codon usage, the adaptation of each codon to the cognate tRNAs available in the cell, the GC content, and the mRNA folding energy. Additionally, each codon has a different role as a speed regulator in protein translation, property that orchestrates the accuracy, efficiency and co-translational folding in protein biosynthesis. Hence, simplistic manipulation of codons for heterologous expression does not take into account the complex biological implications of individual codons.We propose that the systematic overview presented in this work must be considered when designing synthetic genes. We define this proposed approach as Codon Transliteration, in which a gene to be used in heterologous expression needs to be studied in depth.In this proposed approach, each codon that encodes the same amino acid in the original organism must have its properties characterized. Subsequently, each codon and its features in the new host must be identified. As an example, we consider a gene from K. marxianus to be expressed in Y. lipolytica. The codon TGT of K. marxianus is categorized as FreNO (Fig. 7D), that is, it has features such as non-optimal codon and frequent occurrence in different positions within genes, a slow translation rate, but a codon decoding time lower than RareNO codons. Nevertheless, the same codon (TGT) is RareNO in Y. lipolytica and for this reason, it should not be chosen for expression in this yeast because despite encoding the same amino acid (cysteine), it contributes differently to the protein elongation process. Therefore, the introduction of this codon will lead to a decrease in the elongation rate, and generate unexpected results related to protein co-translational folding. On the other hand, the TGC codon also encodes cysteine in Y. lipolytica and it is categorized as FreNO codon, and conserves the same features found in K. marxianus. For these reasons, the TGC codon should be chosen in Y. lipolytica.On the other hand, we expect that genes which are not highly expressed could be efficiently expressed in heterologous hosts by transliterating their codon features (FreNO, RareNO, etc.) to the new host. Thus, in order to optimize individual codons to the new host in terms of their role in the protein secondary structure, we suggest that the category of codons encoding amino acids inside alpha-helices and structural transition points should not be modified. Nevertheless, those that contribute to other structures could be optimized with a view to improving the translation rate of ribosomes.In conclusion, by using traditional approaches, synonymous mutations can affect the protein synthesis in terms of quantity, folding and function (Fig. 8). As described through this integrated analysis, each codon seems to play a determinant role in gene translation efficiency and co-translational protein folding, and different impacts could be generated when a gene sequence is manipulated without the details deserved.

Its translation efficiency is maintained by the absence of slower translated codons (RareNO, see Fig. 5A for details), and the presence of both FreO codons, that enhance the translation speed, and FreNO codons, which assist protein co-translational folding which slow the translation rate in order to support the polypeptide folding inside the ribosome tunnel. This arrangement of a different category of codons allows for normal protein production in terms of functionality, quantity and folding. However, when the gene has been modified (Fig. 8B) in order to improve its optimality to available tRNA isoacceptors (e.g. by tAI), the insertion of synonymous mutations of FreO and RareO codons leads to the enhancement of translation speed which affects the protein quantity positively, but the co-translational folding and, consequently, its function negatively.In another case, an ‘optimized’ version, in terms of codon frequency (e.g. by CAI), of the wild-type gene is presented (Fig. 8C). The insertion of FreNO codons affects the quantity of protein synthesized negatively, but, on the other hand, maintains a slow speed in the translational periods, and by doing this, assists co-translational protein folding. However, excessive insertion of FreNO codons implies more sites at which the ribosome decreases its translational speed and generates potential misfolded structures in the protein with a different function to the wild-type. Finally, when silent mutations are created in a gene, containing more RareNO codons (Fig. 8D) than the wild-type gene, they could affect its translation rate, decrease protein quantity and lead to unknown features in co-translational folding and function.In summary, it seems that codons, through a positional dependency function, are arranged so as to exert control over different molecular events such as the initiation of translation by means of mRNA folding energy, the translation per se by the codon adaptiveness to the tRNA isoaceptors, the yield protein production by the codon translation efficiency, and the protein function in terms of their different roles in co-translational folding. The approach developed in this study, based on the integrated analysis of individual codons, contributes to an in-depth understanding of the biological roles of codons, and features an improvement in the basis of rational gene design in heterologous expression and synthetic biology.AvailabilityAlgorithms description, codes and tutorial: https://github.com/juanvillada/CodGSupplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES Online.Author contributionJCV and WBDS designed the research; JCVA and OJBB performed the experiments; JCV, OJBB, WBDS analysed the data, and JCVA and WBDS wrote the manuscript.We thank Maria Fernanda Duran Meneses and Professor Flavia Maria Lopes Passos from Laboratorio de Fisiologia de Microrganismos at the UFV for research design support; Professor Denise Mara Soares Bazzoli from Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular de Bactérias and Professor Hilario Cuqueto Mantovani from Laboratorio de Microbiologia do Rumen e de Anaeróbios at UFV for their critical review of the manuscript.

We discuss the potential evolutionary implications of our results.1. IntroductionGene duplication is thought to be a major force driving evolutionary innovations.1–3 Even though gene duplications occur frequently, they are often transient, and only a fraction of duplications result in fixation of the two gene copies in the population. Genes widely differ in their propensity to be retained after gene duplication (i.e. their duplicability): whereas some genes successfully duplicate very often, giving rise to large multigene families, others remain as singletons during long evolutionary periods. What factors affect gene duplicability is still a largely open question in Evolutionary Biology.4Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). These regions lack a stable tertiary or secondary structure under normal physiological conditions, having a structure that constantly oscillates between alternative conformational states.5–8 Due to their flexibility and to their enrichment in short interaction motifs,9 IDRs are often involved in interactions with other proteins.10,11 In addition, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs, i.e. proteins with a predominance of IDRs) often have larger interaction surfaces than other proteins of similar length.12 As a result, IDPs tend to be promiscuous in their interaction patterns, being involved in a high number of protein–protein interactions.10,11,13 Proteins involved in signalling, including transcription factors, tend to be rich in IDRs.14IDPs exhibit characteristics that might either increase or reduce the duplicability of their encoding genes. On the one hand, given their high flexibility and enrichment in interaction motifs, duplication of genes encoding IDPs is expected to result in an increased number of misinteractions—unspecific, ectopic interactions with proteins with which the protein is not supposed to interact—resulting in unwanted activation of cellular processes, interference with functional interactions and sequestration of functional proteins into non-functional complexes.15,16 Indeed, IDP availability is often maintained at low levels, and several lines of evidence indicate that this availability is tightly regulated15–20 and that dysregulation of IDPs often leads to disease, including neurodegeneration and cancer14,15,21 among other deleterious effects. Remarkably, Vavouri et al.15 found that IDPs tend to be dosage-sensitive proteins—proteins whose over-expression reduces fitness.On the other hand, the high flexibility of IDRs may facilitate functional divergence (subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization) of gene copies after duplication, which promotes retention of the duplicates. In addition, IDRs are enriched in post-translational modification sites,22,23 which also contribute to functional divergence of gene duplicates.24 Consistent with this model, Montanari et al.25 showed that yeast ohnologs—duplicates that were retained after the whole genome duplication or interspecific hybridization event that took place in an ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae26–28—tend to encode proteins with a high number of IDRs. It should be noted, however, that whole genome duplication (WGD) and hybridization events maintain the stoichiometry of all molecular interactions in the cellular system,29,30 and often result in an increased cell volume, which means that protein concentrations are not necessarily altered.31–34 This is not the case for small-scale duplicates (SSDs), which are expected to increase abundance of the encoded proteins and to upset the balance of the interactions in which these proteins are involved.29,35–37 Therefore, the selective pressures constraining ohnologs retention are expected to be different from those acting on other kinds of duplicates.38,39Here, we interrogate the proteomes of six organisms to study the effect of protein intrinsic disorder on gene duplicability. While ohnologs tend to encode highly disordered proteins, SSDs tend to encode lowly disordered proteins. The trend is independent of covariation of disorder and duplicability with gene expression levels, protein abundances and number of protein–protein interactions. In addition, orthologs of genes that specifically duplicated in the studied species tend to encode lowly disordered proteins. Our analyses indicate that genes encoding IDPs are unlikely to undergo successful small-scale duplication, suggesting that small-scale duplication of such genes often has deleterious effects.2. Material and methods2.1. Quantification of protein intrinsic disorderWe retrieved the proteomes of the six studied species (human, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana and E. coli) from the databases Ensembl (release 85), Ensembl Plants (release 31) and Ensembl Bacteria (release 33). For each protein-coding gene, we chose the longest encoded protein for analysis (in the event of multiple splicing variants). We used IUPred40 to identify the disordered residues within each protein sequence. We used the IUPred-L option (long intrinsic disorder); using this option, disordered regions must encompass at least 30 consecutive amino acids predicted to be disordered. Shorter predicted disordered regions were excluded from our calculations. This software assigns to each amino acid residue a value between 0 and 1, depending on its propensity to being intrinsically disordered. We considered an amino acid residue as intrinsically disordered if the score was = 0.5, a cut-off that is widely used for optimal prediction of disordered residues (e.g. Refs. [9,40,41]). For each protein, we computed the percentage of disordered residues. Additionally, we validated our main results using FoldIndex.42We classified proteins based on their disorder content, as either IDPs (percentage of disordered residues = 30%), moderately disordered proteins (MDPs, 10% < percentage of disordered residues < 30%) or well-structured proteins (WSPs, percentage of disordered residues = 10%). These cut-offs are the most commonly used (see, for instance, Refs. [17,43]). Nonetheless, in order to ensure the robustness of our results to the cut-offs chosen, we repeated our analyses considering an alternative classification: IDPs (percentage of disordered residues = 60%), MDPs (15% < percentage of disordered residues < 60%) and WSPs (percentage of disordered residues = 15%).2.1. Identification of duplicated genesAll genes were classified as singleton or duplicates. For A. thaliana, we obtained duplicates information from Ensembl Plants,44 and for other eukaryotic genomes, we used the annotations available from the Ensembl database,45 whereas for E. coli we generated our own annotations using similarity searches. For each eukaryotic gene, a list of paralogs (duplicates) in the same genome was obtained from Ensembl Biomart.45 Genes with one or more annotated paralogs were deemed duplicated. Each E. coli protein was used as query in a BLASTP search46 against the E. coli proteome. Genes with proteins producing at least one significant hit other than the query sequence (E-value = 10-5, coverage of the query sequence = 80%) were considered duplicated genes.Three of the organisms included in our analyses (human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana) have undergone WGD events. We obtained a list of human ohnologs from the Ohnologs database,47 a list of S. cerevisiae ohnologs from Gordon et al.48 and a list of A. thaliana ohnologs from Blanc et al.49,A. thaliana ohnologs were classified as resulting from each of the three WGD events known to have affected the A. thaliana lineage using the classification of Blanc et al.49 All genes classified as duplicated but not as ohnologs were considered to be resulting from small-scale duplication.2.2. Gene expression and protein abundance datasetsWe obtained human gene expression data for 32 different tissues/organs, measured by RNA sequencing experiments, from the Human Protein Atlas.50 For each gene, we averaged the expression level values across all 32 tissues and used the mean values in further analyses. For D. melanogaster and C. elegans, we obtained the mRNA abundance data for the whole adult body from FlyAtlas51 and modENCODE (data from the EBI Expression Atlas, accession number E-MTAB-281252), respectively. S. cerevisiae gene expression data were obtained from Nagalakshmi et al.53 In the case of A. thaliana, we obtained gene expression datasets corresponding to 79 tissues and conditions, from Schmid et al.54 and processed them as in Alvarez-Ponce and Fares.55 For each gene, the median across the 79 datasets was used. For genes matching multiple probe sets, the one resulting in a highest median was kept. Probes matching multiple genes were removed from the analysis. E. coli expression data were obtained from Covert et al.56 For each gene, mRNA expression levels were averaged across three biological replicates.In an additional analysis, for all organisms for which tissue-specific gene expression data are available (human, D. melanogaster and A. thaliana), we computed gene expression as the average across all tissues in which gene expression was detected, rather than all tissues. In human, a gene was considered to be expressed at a certain tissue if FPKM = 1. In D. melanogaster, a gene was considered to be expressed at a certain tissue if it was detectable in at least three of the four biological replicates. In A. thaliana, a gene was considered to be expressed at a certain tissue if it was annotated as ‘present’ in at least two of the three biological replicates.For all species, protein abundance data were obtained from the PaxDb database, version 4.0.57 We used the whole-organism integrated datasets, which is the result of a weighted combination of the results of numerous proteomics studies.2.3. Number of protein–protein interactionsThe protein–protein interaction networks of all eukaryotic species considered in this study were obtained from the BioGRID database, version 3.4.133.58 Only physical interactions among proteins from the same organism were considered. The E. coli protein–protein interaction network was obtained from Hu et al.59 For each protein, degree was computed as the number of different proteins with which it physically interacts.2.4. Gene orthologyHuman–chicken, D. melanogaster–D. grimshawi, C. elegans–C. japonica and A. thaliana–A. lyrata orthology relationships were obtained from Ensembl Biomart.45,S. cerevisiae–C. glabrata and E. coli–M. tuberculosis orthologies were obtained from the OrthoMCL database.603. Results3.1. Proteins encoded by small-scale duplicated genes are less intrinsically disordered than proteins encoded by singletonsWe first considered whether proteins encoded by duplicated genes differed from proteins encoded by singleton (non-duplicated) genes in terms of intrinsic disorder. For that purpose, we studied the proteomes of a wide range of organisms, including three animals (human, D. melanogaster, C. elegans), the fungus S. cerevisiae, the plant A. thaliana and the bacterium E. coli. For each gene, we chose the longest encoded protein for analysis, and we inferred the percent of disordered residues using IUPred.40 In five of the six species, the disorder content of the proteins encoded by singleton genes was significantly higher than that for those encoded by duplicated ones (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1). For instance, in D. melanogaster, proteins encoded by duplicated genes exhibit a median intrinsic disorder of 7%, and proteins encoded by singleton genes exhibit a median intrinsic disorder of 18% (Mann–Whitney U test, P = 1.39 × 10-105; Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1). The only exception was S. cerevisiae, where the trend was reversed: proteins encoded by duplicated genes were significantly more disordered than proteins encoded by singletons (P = 1.51 × 10-16; Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1).

Given the potential that this trend could be affecting our observations, we decided to study separately ohnologs and duplicates resulting from small-scale duplications, in all the studied organisms known to have undergone WGD events: human,61,S. cerevisiae62 and A. thaliana.63 We observed that, in all three organisms, proteins encoded by SSDs represented the least disordered class, and that, in agreement with Montanari et al.,25 proteins encoded by ohnologs were the most disordered ones. Proteins encoded by singletons displayed an intermediate degree of disorder (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S2). In human and A. thaliana, removing ohnologs from our analyses accentuated the differences between singleton and duplicated genes (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S2). In S. cerevisiae, proteins encoded by singleton genes are on average more disordered than those encoded by SSDs, but the differences are not statistically significant (P = 0.460; Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2).

P values correspond to the Wilcoxon rank sum test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.The observation that ohnologs encode highly disordered proteins is particularly pronounced in S. cerevisiae (median disorder: 31.86%). In spite of the fact that ohnologs represent only ~26.6% of yeast duplicates (Supplementary Table S2), the very high disorder content of their encoded proteins results in proteins encoded by duplicated genes being on average more disordered than those encoded by singletons (Fig. 1). This does not occur in humans or A. thaliana (Fig. 1), in spite of the fact that ohnologs represent a similar fraction of duplicates in these species (24.0% and 26.1%, respectively; Supplementary Table S2), as in these species proteins encoded by ohnologs are not so markedly disordered (Fig. 2).Three WGD events have been inferred in the lineage leading to A. thaliana.64 We found that the degree of disorder was higher for proteins encoded by the ohnologs resulting from the most recent event than for those encoded by the ohnologs resulting from the oldest event (median disorder for the most recent class: 11.99%, median disorder for the oldest class: 9.12%; Mann–Whitney U test, P = 0.003). Proteins encoded by ohnologs originated in the other event exhibited an intermediate degree of disorder (median: 9.72%), but no significant differences were detected with the other two classes (Mann–Whitney U test, P > 0.05). Proteins encoded by all three A. thaliana ohnologs classes exhibited a median disorder that was higher than that for proteins encoded by singleton genes (8.06%; Table 2); however, differences were statistically significant only for the most recent class of ohnologs (P = 1.79 × 10-22).In order to evaluate the robustness of our results to the method of prediction of intrinsic disorder used, we repeated our analyses using an alternative prediction tool, FoldIndex,42 with similar results (Supplementary Table S3). Indeed, we observed a very strong correlation between the predictions of IUPred and those of FoldIndex (Supplementary Table S4). Of note, using FoldIndex we observed significant differences between SSDs and singletons in S. cerevisiae (P = 3.70 × 10-07; Supplementary Table S3).3.2. Intrinsically disordered proteins are enriched in proteins encoded by singleton genesWe next classified proteins according to their disorder content into WSPs (with a percent of disordered residues = 10%), MDPs (with a percent of disordered residues between 10% and 30%) and IDPs (percent of disordered residues = 30%). We observed that IDPs are enriched in proteins encoded by singleton genes and depleted in proteins encoded by duplicated genes (Fig. 3). For instance, in D. melanogaster, 39.30% of WSPs, 46.32% of MDPs and 60.72% of IDPs are encoded by singleton genes (Pearson’s <U+03C7>2 test, P = 2.2 × 10-16; Supplementary Table S5). The only exception was again S. cerevisiae, where IDPs were enriched in proteins encoded by duplicated genes. However, when ohnologs and SSDs were considered separately in human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana, IDPs were significantly depleted in proteins encoded by SSDs in all species (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we noticed that the percentage of proteins encoded by SSDs gradually decreases from the class of WSPs to that of IDPs (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S5). Similar results were obtained when proteins were classified using more stringent criteria (WSPs: percent of disordered residues = 15%, MDPs: 15% < percentage of disordered residues < 60%, IDPs: percentage of disordered residues = 60%) (Supplementary Table S6). Taken together, these observations are consistent with those presented in the previous section (Figs 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), and indicate that genes encoding IDPs are less likely to undergo small-scale duplication than those encoding WSPs. Proportions of duplicates and singletons among genes encoding intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), moderately disordered proteins (MDPs) and well-structured proteins (WSPs).

P values correspond to Pearson’s <U+03C7>2 test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.Proportions of duplicates and singletons among genes encoding intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), moderately disordered proteins (MDPs) and well-structured proteins (WSPs).

This observation is consistent with our observations that ohnologs tend to encode highly disordered proteins, especially in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 2).3.3. Our observations are not due to potentially confounding factorsIn some species, singletons, SSDs and ohnologs have been shown to differ in terms of expression level, protein abundance and number of protein–protein interactions.55,65–70 In addition, these factors have been shown to correlate with proteins’ disorder content in some species.11,15,19,71–75 Combined, these trends raise the possibility that our observations (low duplicability of genes encoding IDPs) might simply be due to covariation of duplicability and intrinsic disorder with these factors. To discard this possibility, we used partial correlation analysis to evaluate the relationship between duplicability (which we represented as a binary variable taking the value of 1 for duplicated genes and 0 for singleton genes) and the percent of intrinsic disorder, while controlling for all three factors (mRNA abundance, protein abundance and number of protein–protein interactions) simultaneously. In four of the species, we observed a significant association between duplicability and disorder, with duplicated genes being less disordered (Table 1). In human, the test was not significant, and in S. cerevisiae the partial correlation between disorder and duplicability was positive; however, removing ohnologs from the analyses resulted in significant negative partial correlations in all species (Table 1). Furthermore, we examined the correlation between gene duplicability and intrinsic disorder controlling for each of the above-mentioned confounding factors separately. In all cases (for all factors and species), partial correlations were significantly negative (Supplementary Table S7). Partial correlations between the percentage of disordered residues and gene duplicabilityPartial Spearman’s correlation coefficients (<U+03C1>) correspond to the correlation between the percent of intrinsic disorder of proteins and duplicability (encoded as a binary variable: 0 = singleton, 1 = duplicated) controlling simultaneously for mRNA abundance, protein abundance and number of protein–protein interactions. For organisms with documented whole-genome duplication events (human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana), we have repeated the test excluding ohnologs. P-values correspond to the partial correlation test. q values correspond to the Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing., P or q < 0.05;, P or q < 0.01;, P or q < 0.001.Partial correlations between the percentage of disordered residues and gene duplicabilityPartial Spearman’s correlation coefficients (<U+03C1>) correspond to the correlation between the percent of intrinsic disorder of proteins and duplicability (encoded as a binary variable: 0 = singleton, 1 = duplicated) controlling simultaneously for mRNA abundance, protein abundance and number of protein–protein interactions.

The only difference is that, for A. thaliana, considering the entire dataset, the test is only marginally significant after correcting for multiple testing (P = 0.037; q = 0.055). Even though the magnitudes of partial correlation coefficients are small for some species (particularly when controlling for all three factors simultaneously), they are highly significant. Taken together, these results indicate that the association between duplicability and disorder is independent of expression level, protein abundance and connectivity.3.4. Natural selection often removes genes encoding IDPs after duplicationOur observations that SSDs tend to encode lowly disordered proteins, and that IDPs are generally more likely to be encoded by singleton genes than MDPs and WSPs, are consistent with a scenario in which purifying selection limits the small-scale duplicability of genes encoding IDPs. However, an alternative scenario might also explain these observations. It is conceivable that, after duplication, genes accumulate mutations that decrease the disorder content of the encoded proteins. To distinguish between both scenarios, we performed two additional analyses.If extra copies of genes encoding IDPs tend to be removed after gene duplication by purifying selection, one may expect the ancestral (pre-duplication) sequences of duplicated genes to encode, on average, less disordered proteins than the ancestral sequences of singleton genes. If this is the case, one would expect that orthologs in an outgroup species (e.g. Drosophila grimshawi) of genes that have duplicated in one of the studied species (e.g. D. melanogaster) would encode less disordered proteins than orthologs in the outgroup (e.g. D. grimshawi) of genes that have not duplicated in the species of interest (e.g. D. melanogaster). To test this hypothesis in Drosophila, we classified all D. grimshawi genes into three groups (Fig. 4): (A) those that have a single ortholog in D. melanogaster (i.e. they have not duplicated in the branch connecting D. melanogaster and the most recent common ancestor of D. melanogaster and D. grimshawi); (B) those that have two or more orthologs in D. melanogaster (i.e. they have duplicated in the D. melanogaster lineage); and (C) those that have no orthologs in D. melanogaster (either have been lost in the D. melanogaster lineage or originated in the D. grimshawi lineage). We found that proteins encoded by genes in group A were significantly more disordered than those encoded by genes in group B (median for group A: 11.46%; median for group B: 2.27%; Mann–Whitney U test, P = 2.80 × 10-33). This suggests that purifying selection removes extra copies of genes encoding highly disordered proteins after small-scale duplication. Similar results were obtained in human, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana and E. coli using as outgroup, respectively, chicken, Caenorhabditis japonica, Candida glabrata, Arabidopsis lyrata and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Table 2). For organisms that have undergone WGD events (human, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana), we chose outgroup species that are known to have shared the same WGD histories.61,76–79 For these organisms, similar results were obtained when the analyses were restricted to ohnologs (Supplementary Table S9) and to non-ohnologs (Supplementary Table S10). The only exception was human/chicken ohnologs: proteins encoded by genes in group A were more disordered on average than those encoded by genes in group B, but the differences were not statistically significant (Supplementary Table S9).

If purifying selection tends to remove the duplicates of genes encoding highly disordered proteins, then we expect proteins in group A to be significantly more disordered than those in group B.Classification of genes in the outgroup species according to the duplication status of the orthologs in the species of interest.

The figure depicts an example in which D. melanogaster is the studied species and D. grimshawi is the outgroup species. If purifying selection tends to remove the duplicates of genes encoding highly disordered proteins, then we expect proteins in group A to be significantly more disordered than those in group B.Alternatively, if proteins become less disordered after gene duplication, one would expect genes that have duplicated in the species of interest (e.g. D. melanogaster) to encode less disordered proteins than those encoded by their orthologs in the outgroup species (e.g. D. grimshawi) that have not undergone duplication. In order to test this possibility in Drosophila, we identified a total of 258 groups of orthologous genes that had duplicated in D. melanogaster but not in D. grimshawi. Each of these groups contained one D. grimshawi gene and more than one D. melanogaster gene. In each group, the D. grimshawi gene had multiple co-orthologs in D. melanogaster, and the D. melanogaster genes shared a single ortholog in D. grimshawi. We found no statistically significant differences between the degree of disorder of proteins encoded by D. grimshawi genes and proteins encoded by D. melanogaster duplicates (Table 3). In 105 out of the 258 groups, the disorder content of the D. melanogaster proteins was higher than the average disorder content of the D. grimshawi protein, whereas in 113 of the groups the D. melanogaster proteins were less disordered (in the other 40, the percent of disordered residues was the same in both species), which did not represent a significant departure from the 50%:50% of groups (109 and 109) with each trend randomly expected (binomial test, P = 0.635). Similar, non-significant differences were observed in the other studied species, except for E. coli and S. cerevisiae, in which significant differences were observed (Table 3). These observations disfavour the hypothesis that the lower disorder content of proteins encoded by duplicated genes is due to accumulation of mutations after duplication.

DiscussionWe have found that, in general, SSDs tend to encode proteins that are less intrinsically disordered than those encoded by singleton genes (Fig. 1), an observation that is not due to covariation of mRNA abundance, protein abundance or network centrality with both intrinsic disorder and duplicability. In addition, IDPs are generally more likely to be encoded by singleton genes than MDPs and WSPs (Fig. 3), and non-duplicated orthologs of duplicated genes tend to be lowly disordered (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The trend has been observed across a wide range of organisms, including a bacterium, a plant, a fungus, two invertebrates and a vertebrate.Taken together, these observations indicate that duplicates encoding IDPs are less likely to be retained after small-scale gene duplication than genes encoding WSPs or MDPs. This is consistent with a scenario in which small-scale duplication of genes encoding IDPs is often deleterious (more often than those encoding WSPs or MDPs), and duplicates are thus often removed by purifying selection (more often than those encoding WSPs or MDPs). Compatible with this scenario, Vavouri et al.15 found that yeast dosage-sensitive genes (those that impact fitness negatively upon over-expression) tend to encode IDPs.According to the interaction promiscuity hypothesis,15 given their high structural flexibility and enrichment in interaction domains, an increased concentration of any IDP is expected to result in an increased number of misinteractions (i.e. unwanted un-specific interactions). Many proteins exhibit both physiological targets and non-physiological ones, with which they unavoidably interact with low affinity. Even if a protein’s affinity for non-physiological targets is low, an increase in the protein’s concentration is expected to increase the number of non-physiological interactions—due to mass action, any two proteins will interact if present at sufficiently high concentrations. This is expected to especially apply to IDPs, which are particularly flexible and rich in promiscuous short linear motifs, and are thus expected to be promiscuous in their patterns of interaction.15 Misinteractions can have a number of deleterious (or even cytotoxic) effects, by producing (i) a waste of functional proteins, some of which can become sequestered in non-functional complexes (molecular titration); (ii) interference with functional interactions, and/or (iii) unwanted initiation of cellular processes.75 As expected from the potential deleterious effects of IDP dysregulation, several observations indicate that the availability of IDPs is tightly regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including increased mRNA decay rates and increased proteolytic degradation.15–20 It should be noted, however, that not all gene duplications result in increased protein abundances,80 and that not all IDPs produce deleterious effects upon over-expression (see Ref. [16] and references therein).We found that ohnologs tend to encode proteins that are more disordered than those encoded by singletons or SSDs (Fig. 2). In addition, the fraction of proteins encoded by ohnologs is higher among IDPs than among WSPs (Fig. 3). These observations are in agreement with prior observations in yeasts that proteins encoded by ohnologs tend to be more disordered than those encoded by singleton genes.25 However, these observations appear to be at odds with our observations that, overall, duplicated genes tend to encode lowly disordered proteins (Fig. 1). It should be noted, nonetheless, that ohnologs duplicated in a very specific context, in which all genes duplicated simultaneously. After a WGD event, the stoichiometry of all protein–protein interactions is maintained.29,30 In addition, WGD is thought to be often accompanied by an increase in cell volume,31–34 meaning that the concentration of each protein after WGD may be similar to that before WGD. Therefore, duplication of ohnologs probably did not have the same deleterious effects expected for small-scale duplications (which alter the stoichiometry of the system and result in increased protein concentrations). Being free of these negative effects, ohnologs probably were able to exploit the duplication-promoting effects of IDRs–IDRs, and/or the post-translational modification sites in which they are enriched, may have facilitated functional diversification, which may have promoted retention of genes encoding IDPs after WGD.24,25 Remarkably, and consistent with our model, ohnologs (which tend to encode highly disordered proteins; Fig. 2; Ref. [25]) are unlikely to duplicate by mechanisms other than WGD,81 and copy-number variation of these genes is often associated with disease.82 Marcet-Houben and Gabaldón28 have recently proposed an alternative mechanism for the presence of ‘ohnologs’ in the S. cerevisiae lineage: a recent hybridization of two closely related yeasts (if this is true, yeast genes thus far considered ‘ohnologs’ should actually be considered ‘synologs’; Ref. [83]). Nonetheless, hybridization of closely related species is also expected to result in increased cell size and to respect the stoichiometry of all interactions.Montanari et al.25 observed that after WGD, yeast ohnologs tend to experience a net loss in their disorder content (a behaviour, however, that was not observed in all genes). This raises the possibility that, given enough time, the differences between ohnologs and the other genes would disappear, or even invert (resulting in ohnologs encoding the less disordered proteins). Our analyses confirm, however, that this is not the case for any of the species analyzed in our study (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S2).Despite the general tendency of ohnologs to encode highly disordered proteins, among ohnologs, those that underwent subsequent duplications tend to be lowly disordered (Supplementary Table S9). This reinforces our model that genes encoding IDPs are less likely to undergo duplication. This applies even if they are ohnologs, because gene families that stem from WGD and that encode IDPs are less likely to undergo further expansion than those that do not encode IDPs.We are grateful to Mario A.

Whether this epigenetic modification occurs in Tribolium castaneum has been controversial, its distribution pattern and functions have not been established. Here, using bisulphite sequencing (BS-Seq), we confirmed the existence of DNA methylation and described the methylation profiles of the four life stages of T. castaneum. In the T. castaneum genome, both symmetrical CpG and non-CpG methylcytosines were observed. Symmetrical CpG methylation, which was catalysed by DNMT1 and occupied a small part in T. castaneum methylome, was primarily enriched in gene bodies and was positively correlated with gene expression levels. Asymmetrical non-CpG methylation, which was predominant in the methylome, was strongly concentrated in intergenic regions and introns but absent from exons. Gene body methylation was negatively correlated with gene expression levels. The distribution pattern and functions of this type of methylation were similar only to the methylome of Drosophila melanogaster, which further supports the existence of a novel methyltransferase in the two species responsible for this type of methylation. This first life-cycle methylome of T. castaneum reveals a novel and unique methylation pattern, which will contribute to the further understanding of the variety and functions of DNA methylation in eukaryotes.1. IntroductionCytosine DNA methylation is one of the most important and conserved epigenetic modifications in diverse eukaryotic organisms.1–4 This type of methylation is involved in various epigenetic processes, including X chromosome inactivation,5 gene imprinting6 and histone modification, and plays critical roles in cellular differentiation,7 regulation of gene expression,8–10 gene alternative splicing,11 suppression of transcriptional noise,9,12,13 and tumourigenesis.14–18In recent years, with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, combining bisulphite-based detection of methylated cytosines with high-throughput whole-genome sequencing technology (bisulphite sequencing, BS-Seq) has enabled the determination of genome-wide methylomes in many eukaryotic organisms.2,3,19 These methylomes have significantly expanded the understanding of the distribution characteristics, functions and evolution of DNA methylation in eukaryotes.In vertebrates, genomic cytosines are largely methylated. Most methylated cytosines occur at symmetrical CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome, except at CpG islands,20 which are often observed in 5' regulatory regions, including the promoters of genes. Promoter methylation suppresses the transcription initiation of the corresponding gene and transposable elements.21,22 Gene body methylation is positively correlated with gene expression levels. Less non-CpG (mostly mCpA) methylation has been detected in embryonic stem cells,23 and the functions of this type of methylation remain unclear.Although DNA methylation is also widely observed in invertebrates, the whole-genome methylation level is much lower than that of vertebrates. Only ~0.1–0.2% of cytosines are methylated in some insects, such as the ants Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator, the honey bee Apis mellifera, and the silk worm Bombyx mori.24–26 Moreover, the methylation profiles of invertebrates exhibit a mosaic pattern. Methylated cytosines are enriched in gene bodies, particularly in exons, in contrast to the continuous distribution pattern observed in vertebrates.26–28 The gene body methylation level is generally positively correlated with the gene expression level, while there is no relationship between promoter methylation and gene expression.24 Transposons are rarely methylated in invertebrates24 but are heavily methylated in vertebrates and plants.29Although the genome methylation levels, distribution patterns and biological functions of DNA methylation vary greatly among taxa, there are a number of common characteristics, including the predominant distribution of symmetrical mCG, gene body methylation, and a positive relationship between gene body methylation and gene expression levels. These features are present in most eukaryotes and were once used as criteria to judge whether an organism exhibits methylated cytosines.30 A recent study demonstrated that D. melanogaster exhibits methylated cytosines, although the DNA methylation distribution pattern does not display the above conserved features.31 In D. melanogaster, most mCs occur at CA, CT-rich simple repetitive elements, instead of CpG dinucleotides and are enriched in intergenic regions, but absent from gene bodies. Gene body methylation is associated with lower gene expression. The most surprizing finding was that DNA methylation in D. melanogaster is independent of DNMT2, the only known traditional DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) in D. melanogaster. The novel methylation pattern observed in D. melanogaster implies that the diversity of DNA methylation in different organisms is much more complex than previously considered and raises new questions about the origin and function of DNA methylation. Thus, characterizing the DNA methylome in additional taxa is essential for a greater understanding of the variation of DNA methylation and its biological functions in eukaryotes.The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is an important model organism for the study of gene function. The T. castaneum genome encodes two DNMTs, DNMT1, and DNMT2, but lacks DNMT3, which is regarded as the only de novo methyltransferase and a necessary component of the DNA methylation system.8,32 Therefore, the presence of DNA methylation in T. castaneum has long been controversial. T. castaneum has been considered to lack DNA methylation because the CpG(O/E) value is close to one.33 Moreover, genome-wide bisulphite sequencing studies of T. castaneum in larva and adult, with average depths of 10-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively, could not detect methylated cytosines.3,34 However, cytosine methylation was recently detected in T. castaneum embryo by methylation-sensitive restriction methyltransferases and immuno-dot blot assays. Bisulphite sequencing of satellite DNA in T. castaneum revealed that methylated cytosines were not only restricted to CpG dinucleotides but also occurred at CpA, CpT, and CpC sites.35 Until now, the true extent and pattern of genomic cytosine methylation in T. castaneum has remained obscure because these detection methods were either unable to localize methylation on the genome or had insufficient sensitivity to detect methylation present on only a small subset of genomic copies.In this study, we used unbiased BS-Seq technology at an average depth of up to 40-fold to detect the DNA methylome in the four differential developmental stages of T. castaneum: embryo, larva, pupa, and adult. We further characterized the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression among the different developmental stages of T. castaneum. Our results further expand the understanding of the function and evolution of DNA methylation in eukaryotes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Insect rearingT. castaneum strain GA-1 was used in this study. The insects were reared in whole wheat flour containing 5% yeast at 30 °C.36,372.2. Identification and cloning of dnmt1 and dnmt2 in T. castaneumHomology searches for silkworm dnmt genes were conducted using the T. castaneum genome databases.38 The initial search results were further analysed using the gene prediction software FGENESH. Based on the predicted sequences, we designed primers to amplify full-length Tcdnmt1 and Tcdnmt2 cDNA via PCR. Total RNA was isolated from T. castaneum adults using the TRIzol reagent (TAKARA, Japan). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-) (TAKARA, Japan) with oligo(dT)18 as the primer, and the PCR products were cloned into the pEASY-T3 cloning vector (TransGene) and sequenced by Springen (Nanjing, China).2.3. Genomic DNA preparation and BS-Seq library generationGenomic DNA was extracted from a pool of 50 individuals from each of the four life stages: 3 days embryo, late larva, 3 days pupa and 3 days adult, using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA). Then, 5 µg of genomic DNA from each sample spiked with 25 ng of unmethylated Lambda DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was fragmented to a size of 100–300 bp with a Covaris sonication system (Covaris, MA), followed by blunt end, 3'-end addition of dA. Cytosine-methylated adaptors were ligated to the fragmented DNA using T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bisulphite conversion of the sample DNA was performed using a ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The converted DNA was then amplified through nine cycles of PCR with PfuTurbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies, CA).2.4. Illumina sequencing and alignment of methylC-seq read sequencesPaired-end sequencing was performing using Illumina Genome Analysers at a 90 bp read length. Base calling was performed using CASAVA version 1.8.2. The sodium bisulphite non-conversion rate was calculated as the percentage of cytosines sequenced at cytosine reference positions in the Lambda genome. After removing adapter sequences and low-quality sequences (N ratio over 10% or quality less than a ratio of 20 over 10%), the filtered reads were aligned to the T. castaneum reference genome sequences39 using the general-purpose bisulphite mapping software BSMAP(v2.73) with the following parameters: -m 125 -x 234. After sorting by chromosome and position, potential PCR duplicates were removed from the aligned reads with SAMtools (v0.1.19).2.5. Identification of mC and methylated regions (MR) in T. castaneumUnconverted (methylated) cytosines are read as ‘C’ if the sequence is derived from the CT strand and as ‘G’ if the sequence is derived from the GA strand. For mC detection, only cytosine sites with a minimum coverage of four reads were used for subsequent analysis. The binomial distribution23 was employed to correct the sequencing data to build a high-quality methylome for each of the four stages. The probability p in the binomial distribution B (n, p) refers to the error rate (non-conversion and sequencing error frequency), which was calculated as the total number of sequenced Cs divided by the total sequencing depth for sites corresponding to Cs in the unmethylated Lambda genome. The bisulphite conversion rates for all samples were >99%, and the error rates were as follows: embryo, 0.0037; larva, 0.0035; pupa, 0.0039; and adult, 0.0034. n in the binomial distribution refers to the coverage depth of each potential mC. For each position with k sequenced cytosines and a total depth of n, we calculated the probability of sequencing k cytosines in n trials with an error rate of p and compared the probability of B(k,n,p) to 0.01 after adjusting the P-value by the FDR. Only the mCs with adjusted P-values <0.01 were considered true positives. The methylated cytosines that passed the above processes were then used for the identification of methylated regions (MRs). First, the genomes were divided into continuous 25 bp segments, after which the segments that did not contain methylated cytosines were removed, and segments were merged into continuous segments. The resulting segments were the methylated regions.2.6. RNA-Seq library construction and sequencingTotal RNA was extracted from each sample using the Invitrogen TRIzol® Reagent. After DNase I treatment, mRNA was enriched using oligo (dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen). The enriched mRNA was fragmented into short fragments (~200 bp) with fragmentation buffer, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers employing the mRNA fragments as templates. Buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were added to synthesize the second strand. The double-stranded cDNA was subsequently purified with a QiaQuick PCR extraction kit and washed with EB buffer for end repair and dA addition. Finally, sequencing adapters were ligated to the fragments. The fragments were then purified via agarose gel electrophoresis and enriched via PCR amplification. After a series of detection processes, the cDNA library products were sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyser.2.7. Mapping of RNA-Seq readsThe libraries were sequenced at the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China) on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and 49 bp single-end reads were generated. After base calling and filtering low-quality reads and adapters, the sequenced reads were aligned to the T. castaneum genome with SOAP2, allowing up to two mismatches. Reads aligned to multiple positions were discarded. Gene expression levels were calculated in RPKM (reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads).2.8. Identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)DMRs were identified in six pairwise comparisons between the different developmental stages using a 2 kb sliding window with a 1 kb step size. The number of mCs in each sliding window was counted. For valid comparison of the DMRs, the number of mCs in each sliding window was at least two. We calculated the number of differential mCs between two stages for each window. The number of differential mCs was normally distributed. The mean and SD of the differences were calculated. Regions showing a >5-fold SD difference in the global methylation level from the mean were identified as DMRs. We annotated each DMR by mapping the position of its centre relative to the features of proximal genes. TSS DMRs were centred 2 kb upstream of the TSS; TTS DMRs were centred 2 kb downstream of the TTS; and intragenic DMRs were centred from the TSS to TTS. All other DMRs were annotated as intergenic. We then performed WEGO and pathway analysis for the differentially methylated genes. The calculated P-value was corrected via the Bonferroni method.2.9. Location of symmetrical mCG sites in the genome of T.castaneumWe located symmetrical mCG sites in the T. castaneum genome of the four developmental stages. The TSS region was 2 kb upstream of the TSS; the TTS region was 2 kb downstream of the TTS; and the intragenic region was the region from the TSS to the TTS. All other regions were defined as intergenic regions.2.10. Validation of DNA methylationTwo methods were applied to validate the methylation status in T. castaneum. First, global DNA methylation levels in the four stages of T. castaneum were determined using a methylated DNA quantification kit (Epigentek, P-1034, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols, and specific methylated sites were validated through methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-mediated PCR. Three methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, MspI (NEB, R0106V, USA), HpaII (NEB, R0171V, USA), and ClaI (NEB, R0197V, USA) were selected for the validation procedure. MspI and HpaII are isoschizomers; both enzymes recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' and exhibit differential methylation sensitivity. MspI cannot cleave the CCGG sequence when the external C is methylated, while HpaII is blocked when either the external or internal cytosine is methylated. For ClaI, which recognizes the sequence 5'-ATCGAT-3', the enzyme is inhibited when the cytosine in the recognition sequence is methylated.Genomic DNA was extracted from the four life stages (3 d embryo, late larva, 3 days pupa and 3 days adults) using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, CA). Then, the digestion reaction was performed using genomic DNA (1 µg) and 1 µl of the enzymes. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C overnight to ensure complete digestion. Several methylated regions containing the enzyme recognition sequences were randomly selected and amplified according to the sequencing results. For these assays, the primers were designed to encompass a single recognition site in the corresponding PCR products (Supplementary Table S7). The amplification reactions were performed using the above digested DNA as a template. All experiments were carried out with three biological replications.3. Results3.1. DNA methyltransferases in T. castaneumCytosine DNA methylation in eukaryotes is catalysed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which are classified into three groups (DNMT1, DNMT2, and DNMT3) according to their functional mechanism and substrate preference.8,32 A homology search against the T. castaneum genome identified one orthologue each for dnmt1 and dnmt2. There was no homologous sequence for dnmt3, consistent with previous reports.35To determine whether the predicted sequences of these two candidate DNMT genes were correct, the full-length cDNAs of dnmt1 and dnmt2 were obtained via RT-PCR. Comparison of the sequence of the putative full-length Tcdnmt2 clone (KX553975) with the predicted dnmt2 sequence indicated that it was composed of three exons capable of encoding a protein with 329 amino acids (Fig. 1B).

The grey rectangles indicate exon8a of Tcdnmt1b. The open arrowheads represent the open reading frame start codon, while the asterisks indicate the stop codon.However, a comparison of the Tcdnmt1 cDNA clone sequence with the predicted coding sequence (CDS) at Beetlebase revealed the addition of a 140 bp sequence between exons 8 and 9 in the cDNA clone sequences. We designated the ‘superfluous exon’ exon 8a. Inspection of the ‘superfluous exon’ sequence indicated that it may be an intron because it begins with a 5'GT and ends with a 3'AG, which are typical characteristics of introns. To validate the reliability of the clone sequence, we designed a pair of primers flanking exon 8a and amplified the target sequences. We obtained two cDNA fragments differing in size by ~140 bp (Supplementary Fig. S1), which revealed that there were two different Tcdnmt1 transcripts. We next used the same primers to screen out and sequence the two alternatively spliced forms of Tcdnmt1 among the DNA clone recombinants. Comparison of the two alternatively spliced transcripts of Tcdnmt1 revealed that the shorter Tcdnmt1 sequence, Tcdnmt1a (KX553973), was consistent with the predicted sequences in Beetlebase, whereas the longer sequence, Tcdnmt1b (KX553974), included an additional 140 bp sequence (exon8a) (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the relative expression levels of the two genes revealed that Tcdnmt1b was predominately expressed in all life stages of T. castaneum (Supplementary Fig. S1). The inclusion of exon 8a led to a shift in the reading frame and shortened the ORF due to a stop codon at the end of exon 8a. Thus, Tcdnmt1a encodes a protein with 1,208 amino acids, while the translation product of Tcdnmt1b is a 729 amino acid protein. The two proteins share 682 amino acids, starting from their N-termini (Supplementary Fig. S2).Next, we analysed the conserved functional domain organization of these two translation products of Tcdnmt1 using SMART software. Tcdnmt1a shares conserved functional domains with other organisms, whereas Tcdnmt1b lacks the C-terminal DNA methylase domain (Fig. 2). The DNA methylase domain is the catalytic domain of DNMTs responsible for the transfer of methyl groups from SAM to the corresponding 5-C in the pyrimidine ring of the DNA. The absence of the DNA methylase domain indicates loss of the basic function of DNMTs. Thus, Tcdnmt1b likely cannot methylate DNA.

Detection of methylcytosines in the four life stages of T. castaneumTo investigate the DNA methylation pattern of T. castaneum, we performed Illumina whole-genome bisulphite sequencing for the four developmental stages of T. castaneum: 3 days embryo, late larva, 3 days pupa, and 3 days adult. We initially generated 191.7, 176.3, 178.4, and 163.2 million raw reads for each sample, respectively. After removing low-quality and clonal reads, we obtained a total of 145.6, 151.6, 141.7, and 134.3 million clean reads, respectively, and aligned the reads to the T. castaneum reference genome, which mapped 81.7% of the reads to the embryo, 80.1% to the larva, 87.4% to the pupa, and 86.9% to the adult. In total, the average read depth was 43.2X, 44.1X, 45.0X, and 42.4X, respectively, per strand for each sample (Supplementary Table S1). On average, more than 97% of cytosines in the T. castaneum genome were covered by at least one sequence read in each of the four samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). From the control Lambda DNA (Materials and Methods), we calculated false-positive rates of 0.0037, 0.0035, 0.0039, and 0.0034, respectively, for the four stages. We then applied the error rates for each stage to correct the mC identification via the method of the Lister et al.,23 which is based on the bimodal distribution and false discovery rate constraints.After correction, we identified 32,699, 75,891, 98,622, and 104,078 methylated cytosines in the embryo, larva, pupa and adult genomes, respectively, accounting for 0.08%, 0.19%, 0.24%, and 0.26%, of all genomic cytosines (Supplementary Table S2). The relatively low methylation level found in T. castaneum appears to be a common feature of insects and is much lower than in vertebrates. Although the global methylation level was low, the DNA methylation level increased during the transition from the new-born to mature stages, consistent with observations in Trichinella spiralis.40 In the human genome, the global methylation level is reduced as the cell differentiation level increased.20 The changes in the DNA methylation level may reflect the response to both intrinsic and environmental exposure. The increasing tendency of DNA methylation in T. castaneum may play important roles during the normal development of this species.3.3. Context and degree of DNA methylation in T. castaneumWe assessed the relative prevalence of DNA methylation in each sequence context throughout the genome in each developmental stage. The four stages exhibited similar distribution patterns: almost 75% of the methylated cytosines were in the CHH (H indicates non-G bases) context, while 13% and 12% were in the CG and CHG contexts, respectively (Fig. 3A). We further analysed the mCN (N indicates A,G,T,C bases) base composition to determine whether there was a significant base preference at the +1 position relative to cytosine. All four samples showed a strong preference for cytosine methylation in the CpA context (Fig. 3B). DNA methylation patterns and chromosomal distribution in the four stages of T. castaneum.

(D) The density of mCs identified on the two DNA strands of chromosome 1 in embryos.Moreover, for mCG, mCHG, and mCHH, the methylation levels of most methylated sites ranged from 10% to 30%, with similar distributions among the four developmental stages (Fig. 3C). Since mCs are relatively sparse in T. castaneum compared with vertebrates, we identified methylated regions (MR) of the genome using relatively dense mCs. Visualization of the alignments at one randomly selected MR from the embryo sample revealed an allelic pattern of methylation in which methylation was concentrated in a subset of sequence reads (Supplementary Fig. S4), which may imply that the methylated sites present in T. castaneum are restricted to a small subset of cells, or that the distribution pattern is variable from cell to cell.Moreover, the density of DNA methylation exhibited large variations across each chromosome (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Figs S5–S8), indicating a mosaic pattern in which the hypermethylated regions were interspersed among the larger, unmethylated regions. This appears to be a common distribution pattern of DNA methylation in insects.2,3,413.4. Methylated cytosines are absent from genes and enriched in intergenic regionsTo understand the functional significance of DNA methylation in T. castaneum, we analysed the methylation profiles of different functional elements, including genes (coding sequences + introns), 3'UTRs, 5'UTRs, intergenic regions, and repeat elements. Both the methylation density (number of mCs divided by the total number of C sites covered in the region of interest) and percentage of methylation (fraction of the total ‘C’ read number within the total ‘C’ and ‘T’ read number for each genomic region) were used as predictor variables. In T. castaneum, compared with the average level in the genome, the methylation level was lower in CDS and higher in intergenic regions and introns (Fig. 4A and B). However, in most eukaryotes, genes (particularly the CDS regions) are heavily methylated.3 Thus, we further analysed the methylation profiles of each protein-coding gene, including the gene body and the 2 kb regions upstream and downstream. After normalizing the methylation profiles for all genes, we observed that the gene body methylation level was lower than that of the flanking intergenic regions: similar patterns were observed among the four developmental stages (Fig. 5A and B). There was high methylation throughout the upstream region of the gene body, with a sharp dip immediately upstream of the ATG. Methylation remained at a low level in the gene body and then exhibited a sharp spike at the stop codon, with recovery to the initial methylation level being observed in the upstream regions.

Methylated cytosines accumulate at introns and exhibit a strong exon/intron patternWe next examined the methylation profiles of exons, introns and exon–intron boundaries. Methylation was significantly higher in introns and declined in adjacent exons, revealing a strong exon/intron methylation pattern (Fig. 6). Only the distribution pattern of D. melanogaster is similar to that of T. castaneum, with methylated regions being enriched in introns and intergenic regions. In most other eukaryotes,3 methylated cytosines are concentrated in exons, whereas introns are rarely methylated. The different methylation patterns of exons and introns may indicate a link between DNA methylation and transcription or the splicing machinery.

(B) Percentage methylation level of exons and introns.Moreover, the methylation level was almost evenly distributed in each exon or intron of the gene body in T. castaneum (Supplementary Fig. S9). In Camponotus floridanus, Harpegnathos saltator, Nasonia vitripennis, and Bombyx mori,26,28 gene body methylcytosines are enriched in the 5' coding region and decline towards the 3' coding region, with methylation peaks typically occurring at the second exon and intron.3.6. Repeat elements are heavily methylatedThe methylation pattern of repeat elements varies greatly among species. Repeat elements are heavily methylated in plants and mammals but rarely methylated in insects. Notably, in T. castaneum, the average methylation level of repeat elements was higher than the average genome level (Fig. 4). We further detected the DNA methylation profiles in repeat regions and the flanking 2 kb regions, which revealed that the methylation level was significantly higher in repeat elements than that in the flanking regions (Fig. 7). We next examined the methylation levels of different classes of repeat elements, including transposable elements, satellites, simple repeats, and other repeat elements (Supplementary Fig. S10). Among the repeat elements, the simple-repeat elements exhibited the highest methylation level, consistent with findings in D. melanogaster. In certain classes of transposable elements, such as LINEs, the DNA was more highly methylated than the average genome level, whereas others, such as LTRs and RCs, were less methylated in T. castaneum.

Relationship between DNA methylation and gene expressionTo determine the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, we measured differential gene expression in the four life stages of T. castaneum using Illumina high-throughput RNA-Seq technology on mRNA extracted from the four samples. Most of the raw reads (6,130,742, 5,850,925, 5,957,631, and 6,115,496 reads for 3 days embryo, late larva, 3 days pupa, and 3 days adult, respectively) were uniquely mapped to previously annotated genes (52.37%, 61.06%, 60.75%, and 50.23%, respectively), and there were 12,765, 12,496, 13,000, and 13,322 genes, respectively, with at least one unique read detected in the four stages. Among these genes, 11,252 genes were expressed in all four life stages, while 250 embryo-specific, 153 larva-specific, 171 pupa-specific, and 408 adult-specific expressed genes were identified (Supplementary Fig. S11).Consistent with our previous analysis, gene regions were observed to be rarely methylated. Almost half of the genes in the T. castaneum genome did not contain methylated cytosines, and no more than five cytosines were methylated in most other genes. Next, we further analysed the expression levels of methylated genes (genes containing at least one methylcytosine) and unmethylated genes (genes without methylcytosine) in the four developmental stages to determine whether methylation was correlated with gene expression. We observed average expression of 72.15 RPKM for the 9,934 unmethylated genes and 56.53 RPKM for the 3,685 methylated genes in the embryo sample (P = 0.000195, Wilcoxon two-sided test); 81.85 RPKM for the 8,266 unmethylated genes, and 53.71 RPKM for the 5,355 methylated genes in the larva sample (P = 0.009852); 73.52 RPKM for the 7,194 unmethylated genes and 55.87 RPKM for the 6,425 methylated genes in the pupa sample (P = 4.34E-07); and 77.18 RPKM for the 7,332 unmethylated genes and 53.87 RPKM for the 6,289 methylated genes in the adult sample (P = 0.02678) (Table 1). Overall, the DNA methylation level of T. castaneum genes, although low, appeared to be negatively correlated with the gene expression level. Expression levels of methylated genes and unmethylated genes in the four stages of Tribolium castaneumExpression levels of methylated genes and unmethylated genes in the four stages of Tribolium castaneumTo further determine whether there was a linear relationship between gene expression levels and methylation levels, we measured the expression levels of genes with different methylated cytosine sites. However, we did not observe a linear correlation between the gene expression level and methylation level (Supplementary Fig. S12). Therefore, gene expression was correlated with methylation status but did not decrease with an increasing methylation level in methylated genes.3.8. DMRs associated with differentiationTo gain insights into whether DNA methylation plays roles in the transitions between different developmental stages by regulating gene expression, we identified DMRs through pairwise comparison between the different developmental stages and analysed whether the genes associated with the DMRs exhibited stage-specific expression. The overall DNA methylation patterns of the four samples were highly correlated. We identified 22 DMRs between the embryo and larva, 93 DMRs between the larva and pupa, and 115 DMRs between the pupa and adult (Supplementary Table S3). Most of the DMRs were associated with gene regions (promoter, gene body, TTS). Genes associated with transcription and development were differentially methylated. The gene orthodenticle-1 is a gap gene encoding a homeobox transcription factor that plays a key role in insect embryogenesis. Compared with other stages, this gene exhibited significantly lower gene methylation in embryo, consistent with its higher expression and functional importance in this stage (Fig. 8). We next performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis for the genes associated with the DMRs between different developmental stages. The genes that were differentially methylated between the embryo and larva were enriched for GO terms related to cellular and metabolic processes, binding and catalytic activity. The differentially methylated genes identified in the larva compared with pupa were enriched for biological phase, enzyme regulator and transporter activity. The genes that were differentially methylated between the pupa and adult were significantly enriched in reproductive processes, the response to stimuli and signalling (Fig. 9, Supplementary Figs S13–S17). Differentially methylated genes. Examples of DMRs found in the homeobox transcription factor orthodenticle-1 (TC003354), which contains a region that is hypomethylated in embryos compared with the other three stages, in which the gene is expressed at higher levels. pA RNA tracks indicate the normalized RNA-Seq signal according to the intensity of black colouring; mC tracks show methylated cytosines as vertical lines, and their degree of methylation is indicated by the intensity of black colouring (black, all reads methylated; white, all reads unmethylated).Differentially methylated genes.

Symmetrical methylated CpG sites occupy a small part of the T.castaneum methylomeAs symmetrical methylated CpG sites predominate in the methylomes of most eukaryotes, we next asked whether this type of methylation exists in T. castaneum. Therefore, we analysed symmetrical mCpG sites in the methylomes of the four stages. We identified 106, 64, 98, and 98 symmetrical mCG sites in embryo, larva, pupa, and adult, respectively, which occupied 2.49%, 0.67%, 0.74%, and 0.76% of the mCG sites in the whole genome. The average methylation level of these sites was >25%, which was much higher than that for the non-CpG methylation sites (Supplementary Table S4). Moreover, most of these methylated sites were enriched in gene regions (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6), as observed for mCG sites in other eukaryotes. Since mCG sites regulate the expression of the corresponding genes in other organisms, we wondered whether this function also occurs in T. castaneum. We observed that the average expression levels of these genes exhibiting symmetrical mCpG sites in the gene body were higher than those of the genes lacking mCG sites in the four life stages (Supplementary Fig S18). This finding indicated that the symmetrical mCG sites in T. castaneum are positively correlated with gene expression level, similar to the classical functions of mCG in other organisms.3.10. Validation of DNA methylation in T.castaneumTo validate the sequencing results, two different strategies were employed. First, the global methylation levels of genomic DNA in the four life stages were assessed using an immunochemical approach. The four samples showed low but detectable genomic methylation levels. Moreover, the global methylation level exhibited a weakly increasing trend from the embryo to the adult stages, which is consistent with the sequencing results (Supplementary Fig. S19). To check the methylation status at the gene level, methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-mediated PCR was further conducted. Genomic DNA from the four stages was digested with three methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes: the methylation-sensitive isoschizomers MspI and HpaII, which recognize the CCGG sequence, and ClaI, which recognizes the ATCGAT sequence. Seven methylated regions containing the single CCGG sequence were amplified from the four samples. Genomic DNA digested with MspI/HpaII was used as a PCR template. The results were consistent with the sequencing results indicating the CpC and CpG methylation patterns of the T. castaneum genome (Supplementary Fig. S21A). Four methylated regions with the sole ATCGAT sequence were selected from the four samples, Genomic DNA digested with ClaI was used as a PCR template. The cytosine in the ATCGAT sequence was symmetrically methylated on both strands in the four samples at chromosome 8:8508082(+)/8508083(-) according to the sequencing results; consistent with this result, the amplicons were present in the wells corresponding to ClaI-digested DNA in all four samples (Supplementary Fig. S21B). Overall, the two verification experiments illustrate the presence of symmetrical CpG and asymmetrical non-CpG methylation in T. castaneum.4. DiscussionThis study provides the first unequivocal evidence of cytosine methylation at specific sites in the four life stages of T. castaneum and reveals that two types of cytosine methylation exist in T. castaneum: asymmetrical non-CpG methylation and symmetrical CpG methylation.For non-CpG methylation, we observed four typical features: (1) a predominant distribution of this form of methylation in the T. castaneum methylome; (2) a relatively low methylation level of methylated cytosines; (3) accumulation of mCs in intergenic regions and introns but depletion from gene bodies; and (4) heavy methylation of repeat elements.In eukaryotic organisms, methylated cytosines primarily occur in the symmetrical CpG dinucleotide context.3,29,42–44 However, a small quantity of non-CpG methylation (mCHG and mCHH, H stands for the non-G nucleotides) has also been observed in mouse and human embryonic stem cells,45,Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltatory,26,Trichinella spiralis,40,Nasonia vitripenni,28 and Crassostrea gigas.27 In the present study, we not only discovered that methylation occurs in various contexts (mCpG, mCpA, mCpC, and mCpT) in T. castaneum but also found that non-CpG methylation (mostly mCpA) predominates throughout the methylome, which is consistent with previous results regarding cytosine methylation in T. castaneum.35 Moreover, the DNA methylome profiles of D. melanogaster and Polistes canadensis46 show a similar pattern to that of T. castaneum, with most of the methylated cytosines being concentrated in non-CpG motifs.31 It has been suggested that non-CpG methylation in animals is a by-product of DNMT3, as this type of methylation has been detected in cells with strong de novo methyltransferase activity, such as ESC cells.20 However, there is no DNMT3 gene in the T. castaneum, D. melanogaster, and P. canadensis genomes, which indicates that novel and distinct pathways in these organisms are responsible for non-CpG methylation. Although non-CpG methylation plays important roles in gene silencing, suppression of transposons and genomic imprinting in plants,29,47,48 its function in animals remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the small number of mCpG sites present in T. castaneum may explain why a previous study did not detect methylated cytosines based on CpG(O/E) analysis.45Among symmetrical mCG sites in the eukaryotic methylome, the methylation level exhibits a typical bimodal distribution. Most of the methylated sites are either highly methylated or unmethylated, which implies that the methylation pattern is uniform among different cell types throughout the body.3 In T. castaneum, the methylation level of most methylated cytosines was ~10% (Fig. 3C). A similar pattern has only been observed in the D. melanogaster methylome, in which the methylation level of the most highly methylated sites is only 50%, and most of the sites are methylated in <5% of the genome. A relatively low methylation level has also observed for non-CpG methylated sites in human ESC cells and ants.20 It seems that a low methylation level is a common feature of non-CpG methylation. Combined with the allelic pattern of methylation we identified, the low methylation level found in T. castaneum may indicate that methylation is restricted to small subsets of cells or that its genomic distribution is variable from cell to cell. The different distribution patterns between the symmetrical mCpG sites and non-CpG sites may indicate that these two types of DNA methylation are catalysed by distinct enzymatic systems. In addition, the low methylation level observed in T. castaneum may explain why the two previous studies using BS-Seq to identify the methylomes of the larva and adult of T. castaneum could not identify methylated cytosines: the coverage was too low to identify these cytosines.According to previous reports, in most eukaryotic organisms, DNA methylation is significantly enriched in gene bodies, especially in transcribed exons.42 This appears to be the conserved feature of eukaryotic methylomes. However, the functions of gene body methylation were not previously clear. The proposed functions of gene body methylation include silencing of repetitive DNA elements in gene bodies,49 regulation of alternative splicing or alternative promoter silencing,11,50 and ensuring accurate transcription.51 However, in T. castaneum, most methylated sites are concentrated in intergenic regions and absent from gene bodies (Fig. 5). A similar pattern has been detected in the D. melanogaster methylome,31 raising questions about the function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions. Since many functional elements are located in intergenic regions, including enhancers, insulators, and many transcription factor binding sites, methylation in these regions may play important roles in normal eukaryotic development. Interestingly, the average methylation level of repeat elements was found to be higher than that of the genome in T. castaneum. Among the different classes of repeat elements, simple-repeat elements exhibited the highest methylation level, similar to what occurs in D. melanogaster. In D. melanogaster, methylated cytosines primarily occur in CA, CT-rich 4–5-base simple-repeat elements. The different classes of TEs exhibit variable methylation patterns; in certain classes, such as LINEs, the DNA is hypermethylated compared with the average genome level, whereas other TEs, including LTRs and RCs, are hypomethylated. The methylation pattern of transposons varies greatly among different organisms. TEs are heavily methylated in land plants and vertebrates3,29 but are rarely methylated in most insects, such as Bombyx mori, Apis mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis, and D. melanogaster24,25,28 and are moderately methylated in Ciona intestinalis.Overall, the distribution pattern of non-CpG methylation in T. castaneum is novel and unique and does not follow the ancient and conserved features of the eukaryotic methylome but does share high similarity with the D. melanogaster methylome. We examined the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation to obtain insights into the source of this divergence. In eukaryotes, DNA methylation is catalysed by a family of DNMTs, which are divided into three groups: DNMT1, DNMT2, and DNMT3.52 Among the DNMTs, DNMT3 initiates de novo methylation in the CpG context during gametogenesis and embryogenesis,53,54 which is then maintained beyond DNA replication by DNMT1. In contrast to these DNMTs, DNMT2 primarily performs tRNA methylation55–57 and plays a lesser role in DNA methylation.58 However, the D. melanogaster genome only contains the dnmt2 gene and lacks dnmt1 and dnmt3, which suggests that the traditional methylation system has been lost during the evolution of this species.8 A recent study confirmed that DNMT2-deficient Drosophila strains do not exhibit decreased DNA methylation levels,30 which indicated that there must be another methyltransferase in the Drosophila genome responsible for the novel methylation pattern. This methyltransferase may present no sequence similarity with the traditional methyltransferases or may be located in unsequenced regions of the Drosophila genome. T. castaneum exhibits two methyltransferase genes, dnmt1 and dnmt2. However, according to our results, dnmt1 produces two alternative splicing transcripts in T. castaneum, with the truncated form, Tcdnmt1b, which has lost the catalytic domain of DNA methyltransferases, showing significant abundance among all life stages, in contrast to the conserved form, Tcdnmt1a. Although dnmt1 still exists in T. castaneum, its methyl-transferring function appears to be significantly weakened. Thus, we suggest that the conserved DNA methylation patterns catalysed by the traditional DNMTs are much weaker or nearly absent in T. castaneum and that the detected novel methylation pattern, which shows high similarity to the Drosophila melanogaster methylome, may be catalysed by unknown DNMTs, consistent with what occurs in D. melanogaster.However, the presence of Tcdnmt1a suggests that the traditional DNA methylation system may still function to methylate genomic cytosines in T. castaneum, even though this function is greatly weakened. Therefore, we analysed the symmetrical mCpG sites in the methylomes from four different stages. Although only a small number of symmetrical methylated CpG sites are present in T. castaneum, the methylated sites were most prominent within gene bodies and were positively correlated with gene expression, consistent with the conserved features of the eukaryotic methylome.While the evidence implies that novel methylation does exist in T. castaneum, its function is not very clear. The lack of dependence of this type of methylation on conserved DNMTs indicates that the phenotype of methyltransferase mutants cannot be used to infer the functions of DNA methylation. To reveal the importance of DNA methylation, we await the identification of the novel DNMTs. However, we observed a weak, but significant relationship between higher gene body methylation and a lower expression level of the corresponding gene, which suggests that genome methylation in beetles may be involved in gene regulation, as observed in D. melanogaster. Moreover, comparison of the methylomes associated with different developmental stages revealed that the stage-specific DMRs are preferentially located in gene regions and closely associated with differences in gene expression, further supporting the association of DNA methylation and gene expression. Considering the allelic heterogeneity we observed, specific methylation could characterize different subsets of cells throughout the body. If so, methylation in a specific subset of cells may affect expression only in those cells. The influence of methylation on gene expression was not apparent in the present study because the gene expression level was determined from the whole body of T. castaneum. The heterocellular pattern is also consistent with the differentiated epigenome. If methylation plays a role in gene regulation, it may exhibit different distribution patterns according to the cell type.59Although the data that we obtained clarify the presence of DNA methylation in T. castaneum, it is likely that the methylome is not complete and that we detected only the most highly methylated sites in the genome. There may be other methylated sites in a small subset of the cells that we did not detect. Detecting this type of methylation may require sequencing at extreme depths. Consequently, we identified only a few DMRs between different developmental stages. There may be more DMRs between the different stages that are too rare to be detected. A recent study in D. melanogaster suggested that the DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) modification is present in the Drosophila genome and is regulated by the Drosophila Tet homolog.60 Taken together with the relatively low cytosine methylation level observed in D.melanogaster, it is believed that 6mA may fulfil the functions of 5mC. Similarly, considering the low methylation level and the existence of a Tet homologue (TcasGA2_TC013798) in T. castaneum35, it is likely that the 6mA modification also exists in T. castaneum to fulfil the function of cytosine methylation. Of course, this will wait the future study.Our study provides a clear answer to the question of whether cytosine DNA methylation is present in T. castaneum and reveals that two types of DNA methylation exist in T. castaneum: conserved CpG methylation and novel non-CpG methylation. Traditional CpG methylation, in which methylated sites occur symmetrically in the CpG context and are highly methylated, is catalysed by Tcdnmt1a, whereas the novel non-CpG methylation pattern, which shows high similarity to the D. melanogaster methylome, may be catalysed by mysterious methyltransferases. Although symmetrical mCG sites are rare throughout the genome, they still regulate gene expression. However, the origin and function of the novel methylation remains unclear. The unknown methyltransferases either share no sequence similarity with known DNMTs or are located in unsequenced regions of eukaryotic genomes. As DNMT2 can perform RNA methylation, it is possible that an RNA methyltransferase may act on DNA, although there is no evidence that such activity occurs. The heterocellular distribution of non-CpG methylation may imply that the methylated sites play roles only in the corresponding cells. Additional studies to detect the methylomes of specific tissues or cells are needed to resolve this issue. The pattern of DNA methylation observed in T. castaneum and D. melanogaster represents a new world of DNA methylation in eukaryotes and indicates that the variety of DNA methylation in eukaryotes is much greater than previously thought. New technologies to detect the methylomes of more organisms with much deeper coverage or to confirm the novel methyltransferase responsible for this unique form of DNA methylation will reveal more functions of DNA methylation.Availability of data and materialsThe Tcdnmt1a, Tcdnmt1b, and Tcdnmt2 mRNA sequences have been submitted to the GenBank.

IntroductionIn the Drosophila melanogaster genome, Telomeric Associated Sequences (TAS) are moderately repeated sequences that correspond to non-coding heterochromatin. They are positioned between euchromatin and the distal telomeric transposon arrays, consisting of non-LTR retrotransposons: HeT-A, TAHRE and TART (HTT), not present elsewhere in the genome.1–4 Due to their position, TAS constitute a transition zone between telomeres and genes.The initial molecular analysis of TAS repeats comes from the study of a 10-kb fragment isolated from the Dp1187 X minichromosome.1 The telomeric region of this chromosome contains four tandem TAS repeats of 1.8 kb for the longest (X-TAS) and two repeats of 0.9 kb1 (Fig. 1A). Each TAS repeat contains three tandem subrepeats of 172 bp that were later identified as solo LTRs of the Invader4 retrotransposon (INV-4).5Subtelomeric regions in Drosophila melanogaster. (A) X subtelomeric region from the Dp1187 minichromosome contains four TAS repeats [TAS-A (205 bp), TAS-B (1,872 bp), TAS-C (1,858 bp) and TAS-D (1,575 bp)] located between telomeric elements (HeT-A) and two 0.9 kb repeats. (B–D) Schematic representation of the TAS-R family repeats represented by TAS-B for X-TAS (B), 2R-TAS (C) and 3R-TAS (D) located on the X, second and third chromosomes, respectively. They are composed of several domains [INV-4 solo LTR, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 domain]. In order to simplify the comparison between members of TAS-R family, the starting point for each TAS repeat was arbitrary positioned at the beginning of the INV-4 sequence. (E) TAS-L repeats on 2L and 3L chromosomes are composed of six fragments of a sequence found in the T3 domain of X-TAS repeats, that we named TLL (hatched boxes). (F) The TLL domain is also found in the 0.9-kb repeats adjacent to X-TAS. The T3-TLL sequence (B) is taken as the reference here for determining percentage of identity between sequences (E, F). Identity between the TLL of 164 bp in the 0.9 kb repeat and the TLL of 147 bp in TAS-L is 85%. (G) The X chromosome of the Canton-S strain is lacking X-TAS repeats. (H) The X chromosome of the y1; cn1bw1sp1 line lacks both X-TAS repeats and 0.9 kb repeats. In all schematic representations of telomeric sequences the telomeres are to the left.

TAS-R probes used in in situ hybridization were PCR amplified using primers indicated by black arrows (A). Primers used to PCR amplify TAS-L repeats are indicated by arrows (E).Early in situ hybridization studies on polytene chromosomes and more recent sequence alignments identified common subtelomeric regions, corresponding to the INV-4 LTRs, for the X, 2R and 3R chromosomes (X-TAS, 2R-TAS and 3R-TAS).1,6,7 These three subtelomeric regions have been grouped together as the TAS-R family to differentiate them from the TAS-L family, which is devoid of INV-4 sequences and localized at 2L and 3L telomeres.8 TAS-L are made-up of non-coding repeats.3 Recent publications mentioned sequences identities between the TAS-R and TAS-L families.9,10X-TAS, a TAS-R family member, has been shown to play a major role in the establishment of P element repression following invasion of the D. melanogaster genome between the 1950s and the 1970s.11–13 The study of this repression led to the discovery of an ovarian silencing mechanism involving PIWI interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis called the Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE).14–16 piRNAs are a class of non coding small RNAs of 23–29 nt produced from specific loci, called piRNA clusters.17 piRNA clusters are heterochromatic, mainly consisting of fragments of Transposable Elements (TEs), and involved in repression of TE transposition at transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional levels in animal gonads.18 TAS-R, especially X-TAS, appear to be piRNA clusters, into which P elements (as well as P-derived transgenes) can insert.1,10,19 Once inserted, P sequences are included in the piRNA produced and these piRNA will participate to repression of euchromatic P copies in the germline leading to the so-called TSE.20–23Current literature studying repression of TEs is dealing with the fact that each TE might be potentially regulated by multiple piRNA clusters at the same time. Here, we focus on a specific class of piRNA clusters, the subtelomeric clusters. We extended the analysis of their structure, function and dynamics in long-term laboratory stocks and flies recently collected from the wild. We further addressed their evolutionary origin by comparative analysis of Drosophilidae genomes. Using in situ hybridization on polytenes chromosomes, PCR amplification, ovarian small RNA sequencing and in silico sequence comparison, we identified a core sequence, that we called TLL, for TAS-L like, in D. melanogaster subtelomeric piRNA clusters. In addition, the TLL sequence was shown to be a conserved part of piRNA clusters in subtelomeric regions of related melanogaster subgroup species. Finally, a striking difference in the presence and absence of X-TAS between long-term laboratory stocks and wild D. melanogaster populations was observed. An extensive analysis of lines established from flies from the wild showed that they all possessed X-TAS, while this was not the case for many laboratory stocks. In addition, a survey over a 2-year period of the wild-type lines allowed us to witness the loss of X-TAS during Drosophila domestication under laboratory conditions. This study reveals an unexpected feature for piRNA clusters that, although fulfilling an essential role as guardians of the genome by repressing TEs, can be lost under artificial laboratory conditions without significantly impairing genome integrity of their hosts.2. Materials and methods2.1. Drosophila stocksThe following Fly stocks from the Bloomington stock center were used: y1; cn1bw1sp1 (FBst0002057), Canton-S (FBst0000001), Oregon-R-C (FBst0000005), VAG_2 (FBst0003876), Wild_11C (FBst0003894), BER_2 (FBst0003840) and Wild_5A (FBst0003885). The w1118, P-1152, NA-P(1A) and Lk-P(1A) belong to our laboratory stock collection. P-1152 carries two P-lacZ fusion enhancer trap transgenes (FBti0005700), inserted in X-TAS, that contain an in-frame translational fusion of the E. coli lacZ gene to the second exon of the P transposase gene, as well as the rosy+ gene as a transformation marker.19,24 The Lk-P(1A) line carries two full-length P elements inserted in X-TAS. NA-P(1A) carries a P element inserted in X-TAS that has undergone a telomeric deletion leaving a 5' deleted P element. These telomeric insertions have been genetically isolated from inbred lines derived from wild populations collected in Lerik, Azerbaijan, for Lk-P(1A)13 and from Nasr’Allah, Tunisia, for NA-P(1A)25 in a genome devoid of other P elements. The Drosophila sechellia strain was kindly provided by Aurélie Hua-Van (EGCE, CNRS-IRD-University Paris-Sud-University Paris Saclay). Between 2013 and 2015, we collected Drosophila populations from the wild in Europe (France and Austria), Africa (Ethiopia and Senegal) and South America (Brazil and French Guiana). In French Guiana, flies were collected in Saul, an isolated town in the middle of the rainforest. The strains collected in 2013 in Marsais (France) and in 2012 in Gotheron (Valence, France) were kindly provided by Jean-Michel Gibert (LBD, IBPS, UPMC) and Cristina Vieira (LBBE, CNRS, University Lyon 1), respectively.2.2. Sequence accession numbersThe following sequences were used in this study: X-TAS (L03284),1 2L-TAS (U35404),3,Canton-S cosmid (AL031884),26 clone AF520587,27,Invader 4 (FBgn0063427), 2R-TAS and 3R-TAS recovered from Lin and Yin, 20077 and y1; cn1bw1sp1 from FlyBase.org.282.3. Preparation of polytene chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridizationSalivary glands from four to eight third instar larvae grown at 18°C were dissected and fixed in 45% acetic acid. After squashing, slides were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and dehydrated in ethanol (90%). Slides were then washed 30 min in 2× SSC at 65°C and dehydrated in ethanol baths (90%). Before hybridization, chromosomal DNA was denatured in NaOH 0.07N. Probes were prepared from PCR amplification products using primers allowing amplification of full length TAS-B repeat of 1.8 kb from the P-1152 genome (Fig. 1), a full length 2.9–kb P element from the Lk-P(1A) genome and the 855 bp repeats from the D. sechellia genome for in situ hybridization experiments in Fig. 2. Except for the 855 bp repeats, these PCR products were then cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid (Thermofisher Scientific) for preparing either biotinylated DNA probes using the BioNick Labelling System (Invitrogen) and digoxigenin probes using the DIG-Nick Translation Mix (Roche). Slides were incubated with 1 µg of probe at 37°C overnight. Slides were washed two times in 2× SSC at 37°C. For detection, we used FITC-extravidine at 50 µg/ml (Sigma) and anti-DIG-rhodamine at 4 µg/ml (Roche) final concentrations. Slides were stained in DAPI-VectaShield mounting medium and observed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope system. Subtelomeric piRNA clusters in the melanogaster subgroup. (A) D. sechellia Scaffold 31 contains five complete 855 bp repeats. Each repeat is composed of two subrepeats (191 and 138 bp) with sequence identities to D. melanogaster TLLs (hatched boxes), one 129 bp sequence derived from TLL (hatched boxes) (Supplementary Fig. S7) and two unrelated sequences of 274 bp and 123 bp. (B) D. simulans Scaffold 3R contains a 403-bp region composed of one TLL and two sequences of 105 and 129 bp displaying sequence identity with the 129 bp of D. sechellia followed by a T2 and a T5 domains. (C) In situ hybridizations on D. sechellia, D. simulans (Chantemesle) and D. melanogaster (Oregon-R-C) polytene chromosomes were performed using the D. sechellia 855 bp repeats as a probe. The probe was PCR amplified using primers shown by arrowheads in (A). Probe hybridizations at telomeres indicated by arrowheads are consistent with the in silico analysis. Labelling at the D. melanogaster centromeres can also be detected corresponding to smaller domains of identity (see text). (D–E) TLL-containing domains identified in D. sechellia and D. simulans are part of subtelomeric piRNA clusters. Normalized germline small RNAs were mapped to each reference sequences: the 855 bp D. sechellia repeat, the 403 bp D. simulans sequence and the 158 bp-TLL D. melanogaster sequences. (D) Size distribution histograms indicate that the majority of small RNAs produced from telomeric regions in ovaries of the three Drosophila species are between 23 and 29 nt in length. The number in each panel is the proportion of 23–29 nt beginning with a 5' uridine (1 U bias). A bias exists toward sense (plus strand) vs. antisense (minus strand) strand production.

Sequence analysisSequence comparisons were performed using BLAST (NCBI) and SeaView using MUSCLE for multiple sequence alignments.29 Minor manual gap adjustments were introduced when needed.2.5. DNA extraction and PCR amplificationFlies were manually homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1-M Tris pH9, 0.1-M EDTA pH8 and 1% SDS and then incubated at 70°C for 30 min. Potassium Acetate 8 M and isopropanol were added prior centrifugation. Pellets of DNA were washed and resuspended in water and PCR was performed using primers (available upon request). This protocol was used for DNA extraction from single flies (Tables 2 and 3, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) as well as from groups of twenty to fifty flies (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S2). Since the absence of a PCR amplification product could be attributed to poor DNA quality, we confirmed the amplificability of DNA samples using independent sets of primers (data not shown). Schematic representation of X subtelomeric regions after X-TAS loss. Four types of X subtelomeres were identified: (A) with one each of the TAS-B, -C, -D and the 0.9 kb repeats like the Dp1187 minichromosome1; (B) with only theTAS-D repeat and the 0.9 kb repeats like NA-P(1A)25; (C) with only the 0.9 kb repeats like Canton-S; (D) with neither TAS repeats nor the 0.9 kb repeats like y1; cn1bw1sp1. Stocks found to be devoid of X-TAS repeats by in situ hybridization and/or PCR amplification were tested to identify their X subtelomeric structure. This was assayed by PCR amplifications using specific primers for TAS-B (see arrows under), TAS-D (see arrows) and the 0.9 kb repeats (see arrows) (A). Noticeably, the 0.9 kb repeats were systematically amplified in stocks that possess TAS-B and/or TAS-D. The 0.9 kb repeats can also be stably maintained on their own at the tip of the X chromosome as observed for the Canton-S strain. Strains shown to have recently lost X-TAS (see Table 3) are marked by an asterisk (*). Loss of X-TAS might occur by telomeric terminal breakage rather than by internal deletion that might be repaired by transposition of new telomeric HTT (HeT-A, TAHRE).Schematic representation of X subtelomeric regions after X-TAS loss.

Small RNA sequencingTotal RNA extraction, small RNA library preparation and sequencing were performed as described in Hermant et al.30 Sequence reads in FASTQ format were trimmed from the adapter sequence 5'-TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAG-3' and matched to reference sequences (TAS, P element, or D. sechellia repeats) using Bowtie.31 Multiple mappers from 23 to 29 nt matching the reference sequences with zero mismatches were retained for subsequent analysis. Annotation of small RNA libraries and normalization factors are described in Supplementary Table S1. Sequence length distributions and small RNA mapping were generated from Bowtie alignments using Python and R (www.r-project.org/) scripts, which were wrapped and run in a Galaxy instance publicly available at http://plastissipi.fr. Tools and workflows used in this study can be downloaded from this Galaxy instance.2.7. Data availabilitySmall RNA sequences have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB19350.3. Results and conclusions3.1. Structural analysis of TAS-R family members reveals that they are more highly related than previously suspectedX, 2R and 3R chromosomal arms in D. melanogaster contain subtelomeric TAS-R sequences called X-TAS, 2R-TAS and 3R-TAS, respectively, though not all strains present all three. Despite their fundamental role as piRNA clusters involved in repression of TEs (such as P element), little is known about their dynamics. To address this question, we first revisited the precise structure of these TAS.The X subtelomeric region was studied by revisiting the Dp1187 X minichromosome sequence encoding the only complete X-TAS locus sequenced to date.1 According to this initial study, it contains a tandem of four TAS repeats, named TAS-A to -D, upstream of two 0.9 kb repeats (Fig. 1A). TAS-B (1,872 bp), the longest, was considered to be the reference for X-TAS repeats.1,TAS-A (205 bp) appears to originate from a telomeric 5' terminal deletion within a longer TAS repeat repaired by telomeric HTT transposition events. TAS-C (1,858 bp) differs by a few indels from TAS-B. TAS-D (1,575 bp, 95% identical with TAS-B) contains a 313-bp deletion within the 3' region of the unit compared to TAS-B (Supplementary Fig. S1). To revisit the portion of TAS-R originating from INV-4 LTRs, we performed sequence comparisons between the LTR of the canonical INV-4 346 bp sequence and TAS-R sequences. We found that the portion of the TAS-R that matches with the INV-4 LTR were more extensive than the three 172 bp repeats originally described.1,5 For instance, the three partial INV-4 LTR sequences identified in X-TAS were 248, 172 and 235 bp in length with more than 83% similarity with the canonical LTR. 2R-TAS was shown to contain four tandem INV-4 LTR partial sequences and 3R-TAS, three INV-4 LTR partial sequences, two of which were longer than 172 bp (for details see Fig. 1B–D and Supplementary Fig. S2).We next asked whether the shared origin between the X-TAS, 2R-TAS and 3R-TAS was limited to the INV-4 LTR region. By performing multiple alignments between the remnants of the three loci, five other domains were identified that we named T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 (Fig. 1B–D). The T1 and T4 domains were present in all three TAS-R loci, the T2 domain in X-TAS and 3R-TAS, and the T5 domain in 2R-TAS and 3R-TAS (Supplementary Fig. S3). Only the T3 domain, 909 bp in length, was found to be restricted to one TAS-R family member, X-TAS, except for an internal domain (see below).Taken together, the characterization of TAS-R sequences indicates that members of this family are more closely related to each other than originally suspected. Indeed, they are a mosaic of six domains (T1–T5 and INV-4) organized in a specific order at subtelomeres.3.2. TAS-R and TAS-L families are relatedWe next investigated the origin of each of the “T”domains (T1–T5) identified above. Using several databases, the only sequence alignments recovered corresponded to those of a 158-bp region located in the T3 domain with sequences in subtelomeric TAS-L family repeats located on the 2L and 3L chromosomes (Fig. 1B and E, Supplementary Fig. S4) as well with sequences in the two domains of the 0.9 kb repeats next to X-TAS (Fig. 1B and F and Supplementary Fig. S5). The 2L-TAS and 3L-TAS are identical subtelomeric minisatellite repeats.3 In the y1; cn1bw1sp1 reference genome (FlyBase.org), we found 11 repeats and 42 repeats of 458 bp on the 2L and 3L subtelomeres, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). Such similarities between TAS-R and TAS-L families have been suggested recently.9,10 In this study, we specify these similarities showing that TAS-L repeats consists of six tandemly-repeated sequences of 147, 53, 29, 44, 45 and 20 bp in length that share over 80% sequence similarity with the 158 bp region identified in the T3 domain of X-TAS (Fig. 1E). For this reason, we named this 158 bp domain, the TLL domain. BLAST searches using the whole T3 domain also unveiled similarities between TLL and an unmapped clone composed of fragments of TEs isolated from a D. melanogaster strain collected in Samarkand, Uzbekistan (73% identity)27 as well as with two domains of 146 bp in pericentromeric regions of y1; cn1bw1sp1 (~80% identity, data not shown).With the identification of the TLL domain within chromosomic regions carrying remnants of TEs, it is tempting to speculate that TLL could be of TE origin. Since the TLL domain was found to be part of a TAS-R member, X-TAS, of the adjacent 0.9 kb repeats and of the TAS-L family repeats, it can be proposed to represent the common ancestor sequence of the main subtelomeres in the D. melanogaster genome.3.3. TAS sequences in the melanogaster subgroup are likely piRNA clustersAfter the identification of the modular structure of TAS loci and the TLL core domain common between D. melanogaster TAS-R and TAS-L, we addressed the evolutionary origin of these sequences by studying other Drosophilidae. We performed BLAST searches using the T3 sequence against other published Drosophila genomes (FlyBase.org). In D. sechellia, we found nine scaffolds containing sequences ~80% identical to the TLL of D. melanogaster. Scaffold 31 consists of an array of five 855-bp repeats that were identified earlier.9 Here, we found that each repeat contains two TLLs of 191 and 138 bp, and two unrelated sequences of 403 and 123 bp (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). This array is flanked on one side by a TART telomeric element and on the other side by a region containing a T5 domain, a T2 domain (>90 and 85% identity, respectively) and, 8.8 kb from T2, the GM16406 gene, the ortholog of D. melanogaster Map205 the most distal gene on 3R chromosome. Scaffold 14 contains a similar 855 bp domain in proximity to the ortholog of the D. melanogaster l(2)gl gene, the most distal gene on 2L (data not shown). Using the D. sechellia 855 bp repeat, BLAST searches identified eight scaffolds within the D. simulans genome. Among them, Scaffold 3R contains the GD16184 gene, the ortholog of the Map205 gene 2.3 kb away from a region containing a T2 domain (86% identity), a T5 domain (90% identity), a TLL (>80% identity) and two related domains of 105 and 129 bp (Fig. 2B). Moreover, syntenic regions consisting of one TLL and one 129 bp-like sequence were found in the 855 bp repeats of D. sechellia, in D. simulans and in the D. melanogaster TAS-L and 0.9-kb repeat (Supplementary Fig. S7B and C). Results of the alignment between the D. sechellia 129-bp sequence and the D. melanogaster TAS-L strongly suggest that the 129-bp sequence and TLL are related (Supplementary Fig. S7B and C). In D. erecta, seven scaffolds were identified containing smaller TLL repeats (60–65 bp) 85% identical to the D. sechellia TLL. Among them, Scaffold 4820 contains four tandemly repeated domains of 998 bp which include an 128-bp sequence aligning with the TLL and which are at a distance of 13 kb from the ortholog of l(2)gl (GG24690) (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Finally, in D. yakuba, Scaffold 2L contains two almost identical TLLs of 64 bp, spaced by a region of 102 bp, 2 kb from the GE16527 gene, the ortholog of l(2)gl in this species (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Six other scaffolds in D. yakuba contain ~170 bp 88% identical to the 274 bp internal sequence of the D. sechellia 855 bp repeats. The conserved synteny within the melanogaster subgroup suggested a telomeric location that was confirmed by in situ hybridization performed on polytene chromosomes from D. sechellia and D. simulans using a probe prepared with the 855 bp repeat of D. sechellia (Fig. 2C). When hybridization was performed on D. melanogaster chromosomes (Oregon-R-C), the 855 bp probe labelled X-TAS, 2L-TAS and 3L-TAS, as well as 3R-TAS and on the chromocenter (Fig. 2C). Finally, analysis of small RNAs extracted from D. sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster ovaries revealed that the repeats identified in these species are able to produce small RNAs of a restricted size distribution of 23–29 nt with a clear uridine bias at their 5' end (1U bias) (Fig. 2D and E) that are two key features of piRNAs.20 Therefore, these results strongly suggested that the conserved repeats identified in these species represent subtelomeric piRNA clusters.3.4. Distribution of TAS-R family in D. melanogaster laboratory stocksIn order to address the question as to whether variability in the presence of TAS sequences exists between strains, we conducted an extensive analysis of various laboratory stocks focusing on the TAS-R family. The y1; cn1bw1sp1 genome contains at least six 3R-TAS, one 2R-TAS but no X-TAS repeats (flybase.org), while molecular analysis identified X-TAS in Lk-P(1A), NA-P(1A) and P-1152.13,19,25We first assayed the distribution of TAS-R within the five unrelated standard laboratory stocks, i.e. Canton-S, Oregon-R-C, w1118, ywc and y1cn1bw1sp1, by performing in situ hybridization on polytene chromosomes of salivary glands of third instar larvae with a D. melanogaster X-TAS probe (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). This probe is expected to label specifically the three TAS-R loci due to the number of shared domains between the TAS-R family members. Control experiments using Lk-P(1A) and P-1152 lines showed strong labellings of the X and 2R telomeres for Lk-P(1A), and of the X and 3R telomeres for P-1152 (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S8). As summarized in Table 1, the five standard laboratory strains contain TAS on 2R and/or 3R autosomal loci and none on the X chromosome, except for Oregon-R-C (Supplementary Fig. S8). It is important to note that depending on individual stocks tested, Oregon-R-C possesses (this study) or lacks32 the X-TAS subtelomeric locus. In situ hybridization results for the presence/absence of X-TAS were consistent with results of PCR amplifications using specific primers for the T3 domain present in TAS-B (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1), providing us with an easy assay to systematically screen for the presence/absence of X-TAS. Using sequences available in databases,1,26,28 absence of X-TAS repeats in Canton-S and y1; cn1bw1sp1 was confirmed and presence (Canton-S) or absence (y1; cn1bw1sp1) of the 0.9 kb repeats was demonstrated (Fig. 1G and H).

(A) Polytene chromosomes of salivary gland of third instar larvae (DAPI staining) were hybridized with specific probes for TAS-R repeats. TAS-R sequences are present on the X and 2R telomeres in the Lk-P(1A) line and on X, 2R and 3R telomeres in Chantemesle, Reth and Cacao H1C. Other examples of TAS-R localization in various stocks can be found in Supplementary Figs. S8 and S9 and summarized on Tables 1 and 2. (B-G) Graphs show normalized profiles of ovarian small RNAs mapping with 0 mismatches to subtelomeric loci [T3 domain, representative of X-TAS belonging to the TAS-R family (B, C), the 0.9 kb repeats (D, E) and the TAS-L family (F, G)]. Size distribution histograms (B, D and F) and read maps (C, E and G) show the length of small RNA (20–29 nt) and the abundance of normalized piRNAs (23–29 nt) matching to each reference sequence, respectively. Numbers at the bottom right of the size distribution histograms indicate the ratio of 23–29 nt small RNAs starting with an uridine (1 U bias) (ND: Not Determined). Although the piRNA profiles between lines appear similar, differences in the amount of piRNA can be noticed. Absence of TAS-L piRNA in Lk-P(1A) suggests that the 2L and 3L-TAS loci were lost. PCR amplification screen using TAS-L specific primers identified a total of two stocks out of 43 missing the TAS-L family sequences (Tables 1 and 2). This suggested that, contrary to the TAS-R family, complete deletion of TAS-L loci does not affect viability. Other analysis of small RNA profiles can be found in Supplementary Fig. S10.Distribution of piRNA subtelomeric clusters in recently collected D. melanogaster.

(B-G) Graphs show normalized profiles of ovarian small RNAs mapping with 0 mismatches to subtelomeric loci [T3 domain, representative of X-TAS belonging to the TAS-R family (B, C), the 0.9 kb repeats (D, E) and the TAS-L family (F, G)].

Although the piRNA profiles between lines appear similar, differences in the amount of piRNA can be noticed. Absence of TAS-L piRNA in Lk-P(1A) suggests that the 2L and 3L-TAS loci were lost. PCR amplification screen using TAS-L specific primers identified a total of two stocks out of 43 missing the TAS-L family sequences (Tables 1 and 2). This suggested that, contrary to the TAS-R family, complete deletion of TAS-L loci does not affect viability. Other analysis of small RNA profiles can be found in Supplementary Fig. S10.In order to extend this analysis, we performed in situ hybridization screen on polytene chromosomes and/or PCR amplifications on 11 unrelated fly stocks from diverse locations in the world and introduced into our laboratory or Stock Centers several decades ago. In situ hybridization results summarized in Table 1 showed that none of the strains are totally devoid of TAS-R loci, but that the majority are devoid of X-TAS (8/11) (some examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. S8). Interestingly, BER_2, the first strain found to carry P elements in the 1950s,11 still possesses X-TAS containing P sequences (Supplementary Fig. S8). Moreover, the Para Wirra strain, initially described to contain P element sequences inserted at the 1A cytological site, suggesting the presence of X-TAS at the time,12 no longer presents X-TAS today (Table 1).Therefore, none of the stocks tested are completely devoid of TAS-R family repeats. Nevertheless, X-TAS appear to have a particular status, since the majority of laboratory stocks tested lacks this locus (12/16), a bias that is not seen for the 2R- (1/13) or 3R-TAS (2/13) loci. This finding implicates that it may be more critical to maintain 2R- and 3R-TAS than X-TAS, suggesting a differential functional role between these TAS in fly biology.3.5. Subtelomeric regions in D. melanogaster wild populationsTo investigate the frequency of X-TAS in flies living in the wild, we generated a total of 95 D. melanogaster stocks from flies sampled in three continents (Africa, America and Europe). We performed in situ hybridizations and/or PCR amplifications immediately upon generation of all 95 stocks (i.e. on the founders of the lines) and a few months after their capture (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Supplementary Table S2). As shown in Table 2, the 23 lines tested by in situ hybridization possess at least two TAS-R loci. Lines isolated from the same location displayed polymorphism as regarding the presence of autosomic TAS within a population (see Marsais, Niort and Saul strains). In contrast to the long-term laboratory stocks, all 95 stocks established from flies recently collected from the wild possessed the X-TAS locus except for one, i.e. the line from Ilha Grande (Brazil) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). In the latter case, the stock was established from one captured female. Two sublines were then generated (Ilha Grande-1 and Ilha Grande-2) that were tested 3 months post-sampling for the presence/absence of X-TAS. Since at this point one of the two sublines, Ilha Grande-1, carried no X-TAS (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2), it is tempting to speculate that loss of the X-TAS occurred soon after this subline was established. Distribution of TAS family in recently collected strainsaThe data were obtained by PCR amplification using specific primers testing the presence of T3 domain or TAS-L family.bThe data were obtained by in situ hybridization on polytene chromosome of at least four larvae using a TAS-R probe.Distribution of TAS family in recently collected strainsaThe data were obtained by PCR amplification using specific primers testing the presence of T3 domain or TAS-L family.bThe data were obtained by in situ hybridization on polytene chromosome of at least four larvae using a TAS-R probe.Finally, ovarian small RNA sequencing using three lines established from recently collected flies (Chantemesle, Reth and Cacao H1C) and three laboratory stocks (Lk-P(1A), Oregon-R-C and P-1152), all carrying X-TAS, demonstrated the production of small RNAs from the T3 domain in all cases. These small RNAs have a defined length of 23–29 nt and a 5' uridine bias consistent with piRNA molecular properties (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S10A). Moreover, a bias toward production of sense piRNAs was noted for all stocks tested, suggesting that X-TAS repeats are asymmetric piRNA clusters. The presence of P elements (Lk-P(1A), Reth, Cacao H1C) or P-transgenes (P-1152) in X-TAS did not affect piRNA production when compared with strains devoid of P elements in X-TAS (Oregon-R-C, Chantemesle) (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Figs. S9, S10 and Supplementary Results). Interestingly, the 0.9-kb repeats were also able to produce piRNAs independent of the presence or absence of X-TAS arrays (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S10C). The 0.9-kb repeats and the X-TAS appear to be two independent piRNA clusters.Therefore, the prevalence of functional dual-strand subtelomeric piRNA clusters in recently collected D. melanogaster stocks (22/23 stocks) is significantly higher than that in stocks kept for a long period of time in standardized laboratory conditions (4/16) (Chi square test, P < 0.001).3.6. The X-TAS locus can be lost in stocks within 2 years of their introduction into the laboratoryThe results above suggest that loss of X-TAS may occur early during establishment of stocks in the laboratory from flies collected in the wild. In order to determine the frequency of X-TAS loss upon establishment and maintenance of such fly stocks in laboratories, and estimate the kinetics of this process, two independent stocks, called A and B were established upon recent sampling of flies in the wild (Supplementary Table S2). Presence of X-TAS repeats was assayed by PCR amplifications at different time points after the sampling. After 1 year of maintenance, the stocks Saul A3-A and Saul 13-B from French Guiana have lost X-TAS repeats (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S2). We extended the analysis to strains kept for 2 years and identified seven additional stocks that no longer possess X-TAS (Niort G2-A and Niort P2.4-A; Marsais 53Ja-B, Marsais 90C-B, Niort P2.6-B, Niort L3-B and Saul FG24-B) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S2). To confirm X-TAS loss, we further analyzed Marsais 53Ja stocks A and B 2 years after collection from the wild by in situ hybridization on polytene chromosome from salivary glands of ten male larvae (i.e. hemizygote for the X chromosome). While stock A had conserved the three TAS-R loci for all nuclei tested (n = 285) a few months post-sampling, X-TAS loci were consistently absent from all nuclei tested of stock B (n = 297) (Fig. 5). In order to increase the number of tested flies, we also individually PCR amplified 20 males from the stock B, and found that 18 out of 20 males have lost the X-TAS locus (Supplementary Table S3).

(A) In stock A, the three TAS-R loci are labeled thus presenting the same pattern as when tested a few months after the capture (data not shown). Chromosomal ends of the two 3R arm homologs have been separated during the squash, showing the labeling on each of the homologous chromosomes. (B) In stock B, only two TAS (at 2R and 3R) are labeled, whereas a short time after capture all three TAS-R loci were present (data not shown) indicating the loss of X-TAS in this subline. Therefore, it is possible to witness, in the space of a two-year period, the loss of an X-TAS from a line introduced into the laboratory from the wild. Numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of nuclei studied isolated from ten male larvae. Additional in situ hybridizations are discussed in the Supplementary results.Complete loss of the X-TAS locus in a two-year period. In situ hybridizations on polytene chromosomes from salivary glands from third instar larvae were performed on stocks at different time points after collection from the wild.

Additional in situ hybridizations are discussed in the Supplementary results.To elucidate the structure of X chromosome extremities after X-TAS loss, PCR amplifications of X-TAS depleted stocks using specific primers for T3 (TAS-B) and the 0.9-kb repeats were performed (see above). However, although in situ hybridization with the TAS probe on the NA-P(1A) line showed a faint band on the X telomere (Supplementary Fig. S8), no PCR amplification was obtained using T3 specific primers. By designing new primer sets, we found that only the TAS-D repeat, the most divergent repeat from TAS-B, was present (Fig. 5). By using specific PCR primer sets for TAS-B, TAS-D and the 0.9-kb repeats, we found that TAS-B amplification was always associated with TAS-D and 0.9-kb repeat PCR amplifications, and that TAS-D amplification was always associated with 0.9-kb repeats amplification. Therefore, the organization of X subtelomeres, when present, is similar to the one described from the minichromosome more than 20 years ago. Figure 3 displays a schematic representation of subtelomeric structures as deduced from the PCR amplifications. It shows that three of the recently collected lines that lost X-TAS still possess the TAS-D repeat like NA-P(1A) (Fig. 3B), another one of these lines that has retained the 0.9-kb repeats like Canton-S (Fig. 3C) and five other lines that have lost the three domains tested (TAS-B, TAS-D and 0.9 kb) like y1; cn1bw1sp1 (Fig. 3D). Finally, we also tested strains, which have been maintained in laboratory conditions for decades and are devoid of X-TAS locus. Seven out of the 14 lines tested have a deletion of the whole X subtelomere (Fig. 3D) and three have only retained the 0.9-kb repeats (Fig. 3C).What is the molecular mechanism of TAS loss? Anderson et al.33 suggested the existence of a recombination hot spot in the most distal portion of the X chromosome consistent with a role in evolution of subtelomeric DNA. Moreover, Novitski34 proposed the existence of a meiotic drive in the Drosophila oocyte that favors transmission of shorter telomeres. Our results suggest that loss of the three types of repeats (i.e. TAS-B, TAS-D and the 0.9 kb repeats) might happen after terminal chromosomal breakage rather than by random internal deletion in the locus. These events could then have been selected for meiotic drive that would confer a segregation advantage for flies raised under laboratory conditions. Since males are hemizygotes for the X chromosome, this loss could then be rapidly fixed in laboratory populations. In any case, we assume that these terminal deletions were subsequently healed by retrotransposition of telomeric HTT elements as it has been previously described.25,354. Discussion4.1. Subtelomeres in Drosophila are ancestral piRNA clustersOur investigations reveal that not only members of the TAS-R family are more related to each other than previously thought, but that there is also a relation between TAS-R and TAS-L. Besides the three tandemly repeated INV-4 solo LTRs already known to define the TAS-R family, we identified five other shared domains (named T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5). The T3 domain was found to be restricted to X-TAS, along with another sequence, newly characterized here, of a 158-bp that we called TLL. Indeed, in silico analyses demonstrated that TLLs are the tandemly repeated unit substructure of TAS-L. Interestingly, specific polymorphisms exist among the X-, 2R-, 3R-, 2L- and 3L-TAS loci, suggesting the existence of a mechanism(s) that prevents exchange in trans between subtelomeric loci in D. melanogaster, contrary to what has been shown for humans and S. cerevisiae.36 This is consistent with previous results showing suppression of crossing-over in regions proximal to telomeres in Drosophila.37In silico comparisons show that TLL sequences are found in related members of the melanogaster subgroup, but not in more distantly related Drosophilidae. Our results indicate that a TLL duplication event, giving rise to a 129-bp sequence, occurred after the divergence between D. melanogaster/D. sechellia/D. simulans and D. erecta/D. yakuba (see model in Fig. 6). In agreement with the results presented here, we have hypothesized that TLL and the 129-bp sequence are thus paralogs and along with T2 and T5 were already existed in a common ancestor (Fig. 6). According to this hypothesis, 0.9-kb repeats and the TAS-R and TAS-L families could have emerged then from successive genomic events (deletion, insertion and duplication) in D. melanogaster (Fig. 6). Finally, results of in situ hybridization and ovarian small RNA sequencing experiments strongly suggest that the TLL sequence could be at the origin of subtelomeric dual-strand piRNA clusters in the melanogaster subgroup that might be involved in TE repression. Model of succession of genomic events during the course of TAS family repeat evolution in the melanogaster subgroup. Shown on the melanogaster subgroup phylogenetic tree, an ancestral TLL gave rise to subtelomeric repeats in D. erecta and D. yakuba on the one hand, while on the other hand duplication of TLL and insertion of sequences leading to the T2 and T5 domains occurred in the common ancestor of D. sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster. During speciation of D. melanogaster, deletion of the T2 and T5 domains followed by amplification events led to the establishment of TAS-L and the 0.9 kb repeats. The TAS-R family arose by insertion of sequences leading to the T1, T4, T3' and T3"" domains. The T3', T3"" and TLL correspond to the full-length of the T3 domain. More recently, an INV-4 TE inserted into the locus, recombined so as to leave a solo LTR and then was amplified. A scenario of successive events (insertion, deletion and recombination) giving rise to the three TAS-R family members known today is proposed here. Note that domains and repeat units are not drawn to scale to facilitate the graphic representation. The origin of the ‘T’ domains is unknown and discussed in the text. Telomeres are to the left of the structural scheme for each chromosomal region depicted.Model of succession of genomic events during the course of TAS family repeat evolution in the melanogaster subgroup.

Note that domains and repeat units are not drawn to scale to facilitate the graphic representation. The origin of the ‘T’ domains is unknown and discussed in the text. Telomeres are to the left of the structural scheme for each chromosomal region depicted.This X subtelomeric region was particularly informative in this study since this region appears to be at the crossroad between the two main TAS families of D. melanogaster autosomes: X-TAS possess large regions of homology with the TAS-R family, via the T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and INV-4 sequences, as well as with the TAS-L family, via TLL and the 129-bp sequences present in the adjacent 0.9-kb repeats (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S7C). Interestingly, it was not possible to find an origin for the different “T” domains. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that TAS derive from successive ancestral insertions of diverse TEs that got trapped, similar to the recently trapped INV-4 and P elements. According to this scenario, the majority of TAS would consist of remnants of extinct TEs.4.2. Short-term dynamics of subtelomeric piRNA clustersSubtelomeric variability, i.e. variability in the absence/presence of specific sequence elements and/or in the number of repeats, has been described previously,6,33,35,38 however, the dynamics of subtelomeric sequence element gain or loss has not been addressed to a great extent, nor has the potential impact of subtelomeric dynamics on strain fitness.Here, we report an original survey of the genetic variation at X subtelomeres between D. melanogaster laboratory stocks and recently collected stocks. From this study, no laboratory stock or wild-type stock completely devoid of TAS-R was identified, whereas TAS-L were altogether absent in some stocks. This suggests that TAS-L, but not TAS-R, are dispensable in some cases. In addition, the majority of laboratory stocks were found to be devoid of an X-TAS locus. In contrast, X-TAS repeats were present in flies directly sampled from the wild and in recently established stocks from flies collected in Europe, South America and Africa. However, once these recently established stocks were maintained under standardized laboratory conditions for several months up to 2 years and retested X-TAS were no longer present for some of the sublines. Therefore, we were able to follow X-TAS loss in real time, most likely due to frequent chromosomal breakage rather than internal deletions inside the locus (Fig. 3). Our data suggest that loss of X-TAS is not influenced by the absence or presence of P element insertions in this locus (Supplementary results), nor by temperature (see stocks A and B maintained at 18 and 25°C, respectively) (Supplementary Table S2), nor by the geographical origin of the flies. Therefore, we hypothesize that X-TAS fulfill a fundamental function for life in the wild that is not required under laboratory conditions. Alternatively, X-TAS loss under laboratory conditions could be simply the consequence of inbreeding effects due to isogenisation.The nature of the selective forces acting on subtelomeric polymorphism identified here remains unclear. Nevertheless, subtelomeric piRNA clusters, especially X-TAS, appear to have an impact on fitness in the natural environment while not affecting the viability of flies raised under laboratory conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study monitoring natural loss of a piRNA cluster under specific conditions. The apparent paradox in the fact that loci involved in genome defense are subject to an absence/presence polymorphism suggests possible functional redundancy between the 140 piRNA clusters scattered throughout the D. melanogaster genome. This may thus provide an efficient genomic mechanism to control a tremendous load of TEs in gonads. Therefore, piRNA clusters appear to be capable of rapid evolution may be because they are, on the one hand, able to attract several kb of endogenous and/or exogenous TE copies and, on the other hand, able to lose sequences that are several kb in length without affecting viability under some, still undetermined environmental conditions. This capacity offers a time window for TEs to be derepressed (as it was observed for P elements in the Marsais 53Ja B, Supplementary Fig. S9). This opportunity for transposition appears to be essential to shape the genome by allowing new insertions that generate genomic diversity, as well as novelty. Among these new insertions, rare cases will be maintained in particular environments, as in the case of telomeres in Drosophila, CENP-B of centromeres and the RAG system in vertebrates.39We thank Clément Carré, Emile Civel, Aurélie Hua-Van, Claude Lespinet, Gilbert and Micheline Lespinet, Pauline Marie, Valerie Ribeiro, Claude et Michèle Teysset, and Anne Laure Todeschini for their help in collecting flies, the Bloomington Stock Center for providing stocks, FlyBase.org for providing valuable databases and ARTbio/Bioinformatics analyses platform at the IBPS for the development of valuable tools.

According to their genomic location, lncRNAs can be classified into intergenic, intronic, sense, and antisense types.1 In contrast to protein-coding genes, most lncRNAs lack strong sequence conservation between species.2 LncRNAs are usually expressed at low levels and often exhibit tissue-speci<U+FB01>c expression.3 Emerging evidence shows that lncRNAs play vital roles in numerous biological processes by regulating the expression of genes in close proximity (acting in cis) or at a distance (acting in trans) in the genome.4With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in several plant species. However, the detailed functional analysis of plant lncRNAs is still in its infancy. For example, vernalization in Arabidopsis thaliana is influenced by lncNAT ‘COOLAIR’ and intronic lncRNA ‘COLDAIR’.5,6 LncRNAs also function as endogenous target mimics (eTMs) of microRNAs (miRNAs), providing a new mechanism for regulation of miRNA activity.7Trees, as model systems for research on plant’s secondary growth, promise to be one of the most abundant renewable sources for the production of wood biomass.8 Therefore, a better understanding of the regulation of secondary growth and wood biosynthesis is essential for improving wood quality and biomass. Previous studies of molecular mechanisms underlying plant’s secondary growth are mainly focused on functional studies of protein-coding genes, such as the 95 genes identified in the phenylpropanoid pathway.9 Nevertheless, few studies have systemically investigated the roles of lncRNAs in secondary growth of plants.Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most frequent genetic variants among individuals and can affect gene expression, function, and phenotypes.10 Recent studies have linked SNPs in lncRNAs to the abnormal expression and dysregulation of the lncRNAs.11 For example, a SNP in the lncRNA long-day-speci<U+FB01>c male-fertility–associated RNA affected the expression of the lncRNA, resulting in photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice.12 Genome-wide association studies in human have assigned 93% of the disease- or trait-predisposing SNPs to non-coding regions that could affect the expression of non-coding RNAs.13,14 Therefore, identification of phenotype-related SNPs within lncRNA loci and association analysis that link the genetic variations (SNPs) to phenotypic variations can provide new clues for their potential functions of lncRNAs.Here, we systemically identified and characterized lncRNAs from the main vascular tissues (cambium, developing xylem, and mature xylem) of secondary growth in Populus tomentosa with high and low biomass. Prediction of functional motifs, potential target genes (PTGs), and miRNAs regulation for the lncRNAs illustrated their proposed functions in secondary growth. We found SNPs within the lncRNA loci and their PTGs in a natural population of P. tomentosa. Genetic association was then used to associate these SNPs with phenotype variations to further explore functions of lncRNAs. Overall, the findings provide insights into the roles of lncRNAs in secondary growth of plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThis study was carried out in a hybrid population of 722 F1 individuals established by controlled crossing between two poplar parents, clone ‘Pt-3’ (P. tomentosa) as female and ‘Pt-TB14’ (P. tomentosa) as male. The progeny of this population were grown in 2009 in Guan Xian County, Shandong Province, China (36°23'N, 115°47'E) using a randomized complete block design with three replications. All individuals were scored for three growth traits, including diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), and stem volume (V). Based on the measurement (Supplementary Fig. S1), three genotypes with highest biomass and three with lowest biomass (measured as wood volume) were selected to produce two pooled samples (high- and low-biomass pools) with three biological replicates. A t-test (SAS v8.2) showed a significant difference between the high and low biomass groups (P = 0.01). For each pooled sample, the stem bark of each tree was gently removed in strips (100 mm wide and 350–400 mm long) and then the soft cambial cells were gently scraped off. After that, the developing xylem cells (newly formed xylem about 3 mm away from the exposed surface) below the cambium were immediately scraped away and the mature xylem cells were obtained by scraping deeper into the wood, using the technique described by Dalessandro and Northcote.15 These tissues, including vascular cambium, developing xylem, and mature xylem from the high-biomass pools (HC, HD, and HM) and low-biomass pools (LC, LD, and LM), respectively, were immediately collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C for RNA extraction.2.2. RNA isolation, library construction and RNA-seqTotal RNA from HC, HD, HM, LC, LD, and LM was extracted using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen China, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Additional on-column DNase digestions were performed during the RNA purification using RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). The six total RNA samples were monitored by NanoDrop ND-1000 and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 before RNA-seq and then used to construct strand-specific RNA-seq libraries separately according to the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide. After being quantified with the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer, the six strand-specific libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform with the paired-end programme. Library construction and Illumina sequencing were carried out by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation (Shanghai, China). The sequencing data have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) under the accession number SRP073689.2.3. Prediction of Populus lncRNAsPre-processing of raw sequencing data were performed using FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html) with default parameters by removing adapter sequences, low-quality reads (Q20 < 20), sequences shorter than 20 nts. To rule out rRNAs, high-quality reads that passed the quality filters were aligned to Populus rRNA sequences using the Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP2; http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapaligner.html). Supplementary Table S1 shows the summary of the sequencing data. Then clean reads were aligned to the Populus trichocarpa genome (version 3.0)16 using Tophat,17 with 3 base mismatches allowed. The reads with no more than three mismatches were used to construct transcripts of each sample separately using Cufflinks v2.1.117 based on the P. trichocarpa genome reference. To reduce transcriptional noise, only those assembled transcript isoforms that were detected in two or more experiments were retained for further analyses, as performed by Li et al.18 Then, the Cuffcompare programme was used to merge the RefSeq, Ensembl, and UCSC Populus known genes into one set of gene annotations for comparison with the assembled transcripts. Expression levels (FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments) of these assembled transcripts were calculated by Cufflinks v2.1.1.17 The prediction of lncRNAs from RNA-seq data was performed according to Sun et al.19 and the pipeline was shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. We only retained transcripts longer than 200 nts with an open reading frame shorter than 100 amino acids and optimum expression threshold of FPKM > 1.0 in at least one sample. After that, we used double filters to evaluate the protein-coding potential of the remaining transcripts. Transcripts were first aligned to the Pfam database using HMMER3.020 to eliminate transcripts with potential protein-coding ability (cutoff E-value = 0.001). Next, we employed the Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) software21 and Coding–non-coding Index (CNCI) software22 to evaluate the protein-coding potential of the remaining transcripts with default parameters. When using CPC, we used the protein-coding transcripts of P. trichocarpa as a reference. Only transcripts that did not pass the protein-coding-score test (CPC score < 0, CNCI score < 0) were classified as putative lncRNAs. LncRNAs were classified into four categories (‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, and ‘x’), consisting of lncRNAs without overlap with any genes (intergenic lncRNAs, ‘u’), antisense overlapping lncRNAs (antisense lncRNAs, ‘x’), intronic overlapping lncRNAs (intronic lncRNAs, ‘i’) and generic exonic overlapping lncRNAs (sense lncRNAs, ‘o’), according to their genomic locations relative to neighbouring genes as defined by cuffcompare programme in Cufflinks suite.23 The difference in lncRNA expression was calculated as the fold change (FC) = FPKM of ‘sample1’/FPKM of ‘sample2’. LncRNA transcripts were considered to be differentially expressed (DE) if they meet the criteria of FC = 2 or = 0.5 with P-value < 0.01.2.4. Genomic characterization and specific expression of Populus lncRNAsGC contents of the identified lncRNAs were calculated with EMBOSS explorer’s geecee tool (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/geecee.html). To explore lncRNA conservation, all the lncRNA sequences identified here were aligned with BLASTN against the genome sequences of A. thaliana24 and rice25 with a cutoff E-value < 1e-10. The genomes were downloaded from Phytozome (v9.1) (http://www.phytozome.net/). The lncRNAs that had >20% of their sequence matched to other genomes were defined as conserved lncRNAs. Motifs in lncRNAs were identified using DREME online software specially designed to find relatively short motifs with E-value < 0.05 and the possible roles of each identified motif were predicted by using the GOMo (Gene Ontology for Motifs) annotation sever with q-value < 0.05.26,27 The tissue specificity of lncRNA expression was evaluated according to the tissue-specific index, which ranges from 0 for housekeeping genes to 1 for tissue-restricted genes, as described by Yanai et al.28 The index was calculated as: tissue-specific index = <U+2211>i = 1n(1-expiexpmax)n - 1<U+2060>, where n is the number of tissues; expi is the expression value of each lncRNA in tissue, i; and expmax is the maximum expression value of each lncRNA among all tissues. Only the lncRNAs showing a tissue-specific index > 0.9 were considered to be tissue-specific.2.5. Prediction of PTGs of Populus lncRNAsTwo independent algorithms were then used to predict PTGs of the DE lncRNAs based on the regulatory effects of the lncRNA (cis- or trans-acting). For the first algorithm, genes transcribed within a 10 kb window upstream or downstream of each lncRNA were considered as potential cis target genes by using genome annotation and a genome browser, as described by Jia et al.29 The second algorithm for the prediction of potential trans target genes is based on sequence complementarity and RNA duplex energy prediction to access the impact of lncRNA binding on mRNA molecules, as described previously in.30 Specifically, the algorithm first employed BLAST to select target sequences complementary to the lncRNAs with parameters of e-value < 1e-5 and identity = 95% and then used RNAplex to calculate the complementary energy between two sequences for further screening and selection of potential trans target genes.31 The predicted target genes were then annotated by PopGenie (http://www.popgenie.org/) and gene ontology (GO) terms were analysed by agriGO (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/index.php) to find significant GO categories [false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05]. In addition, we used the KEGG database (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) and a hypergeometric statistic test to analyses their potential roles in the pathways.2.6. Prediction of lncRNAs as potential precursors, targets, and target mimics of miRNAsTo explore whether some lncRNAs may act as precursors of miRNAs, the 401 Populus known miRNAs in miRBase (Release 20.0, http://www.mirbase.org/) were aligned to the sequences of the novel lncRNAs and secondary structure prediction was then executed using the Vienna RNA package RNAfold web (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/). LncRNAs with classic stem-loop hairpins were regarded as putative precursors of miRNAs. Furthermore, to investigate whether some lncRNAs may be targeted by miRNAs, the target genes of miRNAs were predicted by psRNATarget (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/) with expectation = 3 based on the near-perfect complementarity between miRNAs and target genes and target-site accessibility. The miRNA eTMs from Populus lncRNAs were predicted with local scripts by using the algorithm developed by Wu et al.32 Quiet different from the authentic targets that are nearly perfectly complementary to miRNAs, eTMs can bind to a miRNA with a 3-nt bulge between the 5' end 9th to 12th positions of the miRNA, thus serving as decoys for the miRNA to interfere with the binding of the miRNA to its authentic targets. Based on these prediction results, a potential interaction network of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs was modelled with Cytoscape 3.2.332.7. Real-time quantitative PCRReal-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a 7500 Fast RT-PCR System using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA template for the reactions was reverse-transcribed using total RNA extracted from cambium, developing xylem, and mature xylem of the high- and low-biomass samples, as described earlier. Primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (Supplementary Material S1). The efficiency of the primers was calculated by performing RT-PCR on several dilutions of first-strand cDNAs. Efficiencies of the different primer sets were similar. The specificity of each primer set was checked by sequencing PCR products. All qRT-PCR amplifications were carried out in triplicate, with the standard reaction programme and the specificity of the amplified fragments was checked using the generated melting curve. The generated real-time data were analysed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software 3.1 tool and standardized to the levels of poplar ACTINII-like (Accession number: EF145577) using the 2-<U+0394>Ct or 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method.342.8. Association populationThe association population used for association studies consisted of 435 unrelated individuals of P. tomentosa (2n = 38), representing almost the entire geographic distribution of P. tomentosa as described in our previous study.35 These trees were selected from the collection of 1,047 native individuals collected from the entire natural distribution of P. tomentosa (30–40°N, 105–125°E) in 1982 by using root cuttings, and were grown using a randomized complete block design with three replications in Guan Xian County, Shandong Province, China (36°23'N, 115°47'E).The 435 individuals of the population were then scored for 10 quantitative traits, with at least three clones measured per genotype. The three growth traits (DBH, H, and V) and seven wood property traits have been measured and analysed by Du et al.36 The wood property traits were microfibril angle (MFA), fibre length (FL), fibre width (FW), holocellulose content (HoC), hemicellulose content (HemC), a-cellulose content (aC), and lignin content (LiC). The phenotypic data used for association analysis are shown in Supplementary Material S2.2.9. Re-sequencing of the association population and SNP callingThe set of 435 individuals from the association population were re-sequenced using the Illumina GA2 instrument with an average of 15-fold coverage, and the libraries were constructed based on genomic DNA, following the manufacturer’s recommendations (Illumina). The sequence quality of paired-end short reads of 100 base pair (bp) was controlled by removing low-quality reads (=50% of nucleotides with a quality score < Q20).37 Then the paired-end short reads were aligned and mapped to the Populus reference genome using SOAPaligner/SOAP2 v2.20 with default options.38 To get high-quality SNPs, only the reads that could be matched to a unique genomic location were used for SNP calling; reads that mapped to at least two genomic positions were excluded. After SNP calling, we used our previous SNP data from 10 candidate genes in 120 individuals identified by PCR-Sanger sequencing to validate our SNP calling results and found that the accuracy of SNP calling reached 97.5%.37 Then the SNPs among the association population were mined using the Variant Call Format tool (version 4.1).39 BLASTN and BLASTX were employed with a cutoff E-value < 1e-10 to obtain information in the location of the lncRNAs genes that represent DNA sequences encoding the lncRNAs and their PTGs, including promoter regions (2,000 bp upstream), or gene fragments, respectively. The genomic DNA sequences of the PTGs of the P. tomentosa lncRNAs have been deposited in GenBank under the Accession Number KX155245-KX155490 (Supplementary Material S3). We then used UltraEdit 3.2 (http://www.ultraedit.com/) to capture the genotypes of the SNPs from the SNP-calling pipeline. Low-quality SNP markers with missing data (>10%) were excluded from further analysis.SNP diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis: On the basis of the SNP genotyping data, the average number of pair-wise differences per site between sequences, p,40 and the number of segregating sites, <U+03B8>w,41 were used for calculation of SNP diversity using TASSEL v5.0 (http://www.maizegenetics.net/). Also, Tajima’s D42 for neutrality tests was estimated using the genotypic data. LD tests were performed in the association population using common SNPs with missing data (<25%) and minor allele frequencies (MAFs) > 0.05 in the natural population. The squared correlation of allele frequencies value (r2) was calculated in TASSEL v5.0. To assess the extent of LD, the decay of LD with physical distance (bp) between the common SNPs was estimated by nonlinear regression for the genes and lncRNAs within the same chromosome.2.10. Association analysisSingle SNP-based associations: we used the mixed linear model (MLM) in TASSEL v5.0 to identify the SNP-trait associations in the association population. This model takes into account the effects of population structure and relatedness among individuals for marker-trait associations.43 Based on 20 genomic simple sequence repeat markers described previously in,44 the pair-wise kinship coefficients (K) were evaluated by SPAGeDi 1.3,45 and the association population structure (Q) was obtained based on significant subpopulations (k = 3) using STRUCTURE 2.3.4.46 Specifically, the genotypic effects of associated SNPs could be effectively decomposed into additive and dominant effects under the model. Then, corrections for the testing of P-values for all the associations were performed using the FDR through QVALUE.47 A q-value of 0.10 was considered as the significance threshold.Epistasis analysis: EPISNP v2.0 (http://animalgene.umn.edu/episnpmpi/download.html) provides an ideal genetic modelling method for multiple SNPs to investigate epistatic interactions and was developed for testing epistatic SNP effects on quantitative traits.48 It incorporated tests of five epistasis effects for each pair of SNPs, including two-locus interaction, additive × additive (AA), additive × dominance (AD) or dominance × additive (DA), and dominance × dominance (DD), based on the extended Kempthorne model.49 The contribution rate of the pair-wise SNPs was calculated by the formula: c = SSSNP1×SNP2Varp<U+2060>, where SSSNP1 × SNP2 is the variance of the significant (P < 0.001) SNP1 × SNP2 interactive effect (AA, AD, DA, or DD), and the Varp is the phenotype variance. An F-test was used to test the significance of the two-locus interaction effect. The same FDR method was also used to correct for multiple tests.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide identification and characterization of lncRNAs in P. tomentosaThe systematic genome-wide identification of P. tomentosa lncRNAs was performed by high-throughput RNA-seq of six libraries of secondary vascular tissues (HC, HD, HM, LC, LD, and LM). In total, we identified 15,691 lncRNAs with the number ranging from 6,384 (HC) to 9,732 (LM) across the six sample pools (Fig. 1A). We then characterize the basic genomic features of these lncRNAs. When compared with protein-coding genes, the Populus lncRNAs are more evenly distributed with no obvious location preferences across chromosomes (Fig. 1B). According to their genomic locations, these lncRNAs were portioned into 15,402 sense lncRNAs, 160 intergenic lncRNAs, 77 antisense lncRNAs, and 52 intronic lncRNAs (Fig. 1C). The lncRNAs ranged from 201 to 7,862 nt in length with an median of 1,010 nt (Fig. 1D), which were shorter than protein-coding genes of P. tomentosa (median length of 1,888 nt). The mean GC content was 41.3%, a little lower than that of protein-coding sequences (42.6%) (Supplementary Material S4). Conservation analysis showed that only 42.4 and 20.2% of P. tomentosa lncRNAs are conserved in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (Fig. 1E). Moreover, we identified that only 11 Populus lncRNAs could be processed to be 15 mature miRNAs (Fig. 1F;Supplementary Table S2), implying that the majority of the lncRNAs identified here undergo processing by miRNA-independent pathways.

Expression profiles of Populus lncRNAs in secondary vascular tissuesWe next explored the expression of the lncRNAs in secondary vascular tissues from the two biomass pools. First, for the maximal expression levels (expmax), we compared expression levels of each transcript among all sequenced samples and found that lncRNAs and mRNAs exhibit different density peaks and that the density peaks of mRNAs lag behind those of lncRNAs (Fig. 2A). Indeed, expression categorization showed that the majority of lncRNAs displayed low expression levels, with only 2% highly expressed (expmax > 50 FPKM) (Fig. 2B). The largest number of Populus lncRNAs showed expression peaks in LM (25.6%) followed by HM (24.1%) (Fig. 2C). Then, using the tissue-specific expression index (see ‘Materials and methods’ section), we found 2,746 Populus lncRNAs showed tissue-specific expression (Fig. 2D), and more than half of these (1,512 of 2,746) were preferentially expressed in stem xylem (907 in HM and 605 in LM; Fig. 2E). Our qRT-PCR revealed nearly perfect concordance with the RNA-seq results for the expression patterns and verified the expression specificity of the tested lncRNAs (Fig. 2F).

The expression levels (FPKM) of lncRNAs can be divided into three classes: Class I (expmax = 10 FPKM), Class II (expmax > 10 FPKM and = 50 FPKM) Class III (expmax > 50 FPKM). expmax,the maximum expression levels of lncRNAs across all samples.

Functional sequence motifs and PTGs of the DE lncRNAsUsing pair-wise comparisons among the six samples, we identified 1,994 DE lncRNAs (Supplementary Material S5), representing differential expression within or between high- and low-biomass samples (Fig. 3A). To explore whether these lncRNAs have conserved elements, 55 sequence motifs were identified in the DE lncRNAs with biological functions (Supplementary Material S6). Intriguingly, three of the motifs specifically participate in ‘vascular tissue pattern formation’, ‘plant cell wall’, ‘xylem development’, as well as response to plant hormone stimulus (Fig. 3B). Since lncRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression, identification and analysis of their target genes may help us to explore their potential functions. Computational prediction identified a set of 5,352 PTGs corresponding to 8,931 lncRNA–target pairs, including 3,569 cis-regulated PTGs for 1,812 lncRNAs and 3,297 trans-regulated PTGs for 1,824 lncRNAs (Supplementary Material S7).

Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 3).We then analysed the relationship between expression of the lncRNAs and the PTGs for each of the nine comparisons. Among the 8,931 lncRNA–target pairs, 28% pairs showed the same trend in expression and 6% showed the opposite trend in at least one comparison (Supplementary Materials S5 and S7). Also, for a specific gene pair, lncRNA and the corresponding PTG showed different trends in different comparisons. The non-coherent expression relationship between lncRNAs and their PTGs (cis and trans targets) were also confirmed by our qRT-PCR results (Fig. 3C). For example, in the comparison of HM vs LM, three lncRNAs (TCONS_00108374, TCONS_00011246, and TCONS_00185640) showed the same expression trend as their potential cis and trans targets. In addition, TCONS_00011246 and its trans target LAC2 showed the opposite expression trend in the comparison of HC vs LC, while TCONS_00108374 showed the same trend as its target Ptr-IAA27.GO analysis of these PTGs found that they were representatively enriched in ‘cellulose biosynthetic process’, ‘response to hormone stimulus’, ‘transcriptional activity’, ‘cell wall modifications’, as well as ‘programmed cell death’ (Supplementary Fig. S3). Underlying these GO terms are many developmental regulators of secondary growth, including many transcription factors and genes encoding cell division and expansion proteins, cell wall-associated proteins, and stress-responsive proteins (Supplementary Material S8). Furthermore, we conducted KEGG pathway analysis and revealed that these PTGs were assigned into many pathways concerning secondary metabolite biosynthesis, such as ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’, ‘flavonoid biosynthesis’, and ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’. Among these, 31 PTGs of 26 DE lncRNAs were detected in the phenylpropanoid pathway (Fig. 4A;Supplementary Table S3). The lncRNAs enriched in the phenylpropanoid pathway exhibited epistatic interactions with their PTGs. (A) Simplified phenylpropanoid pathway.

LncRNAs may interact with miRNAs as potential targets or target mimics of Populus miRNAsStudies have shown that lncRNAs may act as targets or eTMs of miRNAs. In this study, we identified 476 lncRNAs as potential targets of 213 miRNAs from 90 families (Supplementary Material S9) and 28 lncRNAs as eTMs of 14 miRNAs (Supplementary Material S10). Interestingly, in the case of seven miRNAs (ptc-miR169r, ptc-miR169y, ptc-miR171g-5p, ptc-miR408-5p, ptc-miR473a-5p, ptc-miR530a, and ptc-miR6459b), each of the miRNAs not only targeted lncRNAs but also was targeted by eTMs of lncRNAs. For example, ptc-miR169y was predicted to target TCONS_00237001 (Fig. 5A) and also have an eTM, TCONS_00013311 (Fig. 5B). Further experimental validation by qRT-PCR revealed a negative relationship between the expression of miRNAs and their targeting lncRNAs (Fig. 5A and B). Based on these results, we reconstructed an interaction network among miRNAs, lncRNAs, and their PTGs (mRNAs) (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, all the results are predicted preliminarily based on bioinformatic analyses and need to be further validated. Expression analysis of Populus lncRNAs and miRNAs by qRT-PCR.

Genotyping and LD tests for SNPs within lncRNA genes and PTGs in the P. tomentosa association populationWe selected the most abundant (expmax > 50 FPKM) lncRNAs genes (see above) and their PTGs, which may play important roles in developmental processes. Among these, 22 PTGs of 16 lncRNAs were enriched in the phenylpropanoid pathway (Fig. 4A). Based on the genome re-sequencing data of 435 P. tomentosa individuals from a natural population, we obtained 87,347 SNPs from high-quality genomic sequences of 178 lncRNA genes and 522 PTGs, after SNPs with missing data (>10%) were excluded. The SNPs were not evenly distributed among genes, ranging from 1 to 556, with an average density of 32 SNPs per gene (Supplementary Material S11). SNPs in lncRNA genes had lower diversity (pT = 0.01804 and <U+03B8>w = 0.0454) than SNPs in PTGs (pT = 0.03422 and <U+03B8>w = 0.06733). After eliminating SNPs with missing data > 25% or MAFs < 0.05 in the natural population, we obtained 34,015 common SNPs, including 6,590 SNPs in 178 lncRNA genes and 32,428 SNPs in 522 PTGs (Supplementary Material S12). To perform association analysis for these markers, we first conducted LD tests. The nonlinear regression showed a rapid decay of LD at the chromosome level within an average distance of 2,443 bp, where r2 values declined to 0.1 (Supplementary Fig. S5).3.6. Single-SNP association testing for additive and dominant effectsWe used association analysis to examine the linkages between phenotypes and SNPs in the lncRNA genes and PTGs. We first conducted SNP-trait association tests between the 34,015 common SNPs and 10 tree growth and wood property traits by using a MLM in TASSEL v5.0. This detected 2,993 significant (P < 0.001) associations, representing 1,163 unique SNPs in 83 lncRNA genes and 328 PTGs. The total numbers of significant associations varied across the 10 traits, and the phenotypic variance explained by individual SNPs ranged from 1.2 to 29.3% (Table 1). Among the 1,163 trait-related markers, 329 SNPs from 19 lncRNA genes and 98 PTGs were simultaneously associated with two to three traits (Supplementary Material S13). Interestingly, similar association patterns were identified for SNPs within the same gene. For example, we found that 11 SNPs from Ptr-PAL, which functions in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, were associated with four traits (DBH, HoC, MFA, and V). Two of the SNPs (SNP1108 and SNP1109) simultaneously associated with three common traits (DBH, MFA, and V). Most (~77%) trait-associated lncRNAs shared at least one common trait with their corresponding PTGs (Fig. 6).

Five significant SNPs (SNP_22141, SNP_22266, SNP_22452, SNP_22534, and SNP_22868) within the lncRNA and its PTGs, Potri.003G095200 (upstream) and Potri.003G095400 (downstream) have additive/dominant effects on HoC and stem volume. The two target genes are 1.56 and 6.15 kb from the lncRNA, respectively.Dissection of the complex genotype effects (additive/dominant) for the lncRNA (TCONS_00059927) and its potential cis-acting target genes. Five significant SNPs (SNP_22141, SNP_22266, SNP_22452, SNP_22534, and SNP_22868) within the lncRNA and its PTGs, Potri.003G095200 (upstream) and Potri.003G095400 (downstream) have additive/dominant effects on HoC and stem volume. The two target genes are 1.56 and 6.15 kb from the lncRNA, respectively.For additive effects, we detected 455 significant associations representing 410 unique SNPs from 249 genes (38 lncRNAs and 211 PTGs) across all 10 traits (Table 2; Supplementary Material S14). We found that 45 of the 410 SNPs were associated with two to three traits, indicating a remarkable pleiotropic effect of these markers. Correspondingly, for each trait, 1–102 genes exhibited additive effects on tree growth and wood properties. For dominant effects, we detected 266 significant associations representing 249 unique SNPs from 187 genes (33 lncRNA genes and 154 PTGs) (Supplementary Material S14). Of these associations, 151 showed a positive dominance effect and 115 had a negative value. For these 249 SNPs, each was associated with one to three traits with positive or negative dominant effects. Correspondingly, around 21% (40 of 187) of the genes associated with more than one trait. Generally, for a specific trait, most of the SNPs from the same gene exhibited concordant dominance. For example, one SNP (SNP_57423) within TCONS_00141756 and five SNPs from the PTG Potri.008G056000 were commonly linked to LiC with positive dominance. We also found a small portion of SNPs showing discordant dominance. For instance, two unique SNPs (SNP_4287 and SNP_4431) from the same gene (Potri.001G030000) had opposite dominant effects on MFA, suggesting the complex allelic combinations underlying stem growth and wood biosynthesis. Overall, we detected 600 associations with significant (P < 0.001) additive or/and dominant effects for the 10 traits, representing 533 unique SNPs from 52 lncRNA genes and 254 PTGs (Table 2). Of these associations, around 20% (121 of 600) have a combination of additive and dominant effects for a certain trait.

Epistasis analysis of epistatic effectsWe next examined epistatic effects of the SNPs to further probe the complexity of this regulatory network. We used EPISNP v2.0 to analye the pair-wise interactive effects for 34,015 SNPs from lncRNA genes and PTGs across the 10 traits. This detected 17,656 significant (P < 0.001) epistatic pairs for all 10 traits, representing 4,334 SNPs from 111 lncRNA genes and 448 PTGs (Table 3; Supplementary Material S15). These 4,334 interactive SNPs, representing a coverage level of 8.6% of the tested markers, did not display detectable additive/dominant effects. These 17,656 pair-wise epistatic interactions could be further interpreted into 3,918 AA, 8,866 AD or DA, and 5,132 DD effects for the traits (Table 3). The contribution rate of the significant epistatic SNP pairs ranged from 0.01% to 13.63% (Table 3), which was lower than that of single-locus associations, with only 76 epistatic pairs having a contribution rate >1% (Supplementary Material S15).

The SNP-SNP epistatic effects can be interpreted into four types: AA, additive × additive effect; AD, additive × dominant effect; DA, dominant × additive effect; and DD, dominant × dominant effect.To improve our understanding of the genetic architecture that affects complex phenotypic variation, we drew the interconnected gene–gene networks for each trait, based on the distribution of the epistatic pairs of SNPs between chromosomes (13,412 pairs) and within chromosomes (3,983 pairs) (Supplementary Fig. S6). In total, 8,898 gene–gene pairs among 111 lncRNA genes and 448 PTGs were detected for all 10 traits (Table 3). These epistatic gene pairs could be categorized into 1,963 lncRNA–lncRNA, 183 lncRNA–mRNA, and 6,653 mRNA–mRNA pairs (Supplementary Fig. S6). Notably, among the 183 lncRNA–mRNA pairs, we found 166 (~91%) lncRNA–target interactions involving 79 lncRNA genes and 146 corresponding PTGs for all 10 traits (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus this work may provide evidence for possible interactions between the lncRNAs and PTGs.We then focused on the epistatic interactions among the 16 lncRNAs and 22 PTGs in the phenylpropanoid pathway (Fig. 4A). In total, we detected 60 gene–gene pairs among 8 lncRNA genes and 15 PTGs across all 10 traits, including 36 mRNA–mRNA and 24 lncRNA–mRNA pairs (Fig. 4B). For example, the SNP498 within Ptr-4CL has an epistatic effect with SNP1096 from its upstream gene Ptr-PAL on V (Fig. 4C). For the downstream genes Ptr-HCT and Ptr-CHS which were assigned to two different branches of the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, we also detected an epistatic interaction with Ptr-4CL for the MFA (Fig. 4C). These 60 pairs included 10 interacting pairs between lncRNA genes and the corresponding PTGs. For instance, different genotype combinations between SNP507 within TCONS_00060904 and SNP498 from the PTGs Ptr-4CL showed considerable non-additive effects on LiC and HoC, although the two genes displayed no significant additive/dominant effect (Fig. 4C).4. DiscussionTo date, systematic researches for lncRNAs have been conducted in only a few plants. In this study, we identified 15,691 Populus lncRNAs with a focus on secondary growth and wood biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Although there are some limitations for the definition of lncRNAs that merely rely on transcript size and coding potential, a relatively robust and reliable list of Populus lncRNAs is provided here for the relatively strict bioinformatics criteria used for the definition as lncRNAs. These lncRNAs shared many features of other species;18,50,51 they were shorter in length and less conserved in sequence compared with protein-coding transcripts, and expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Figs 1 and 2). These findings suggested that these Populus lncRNAs may exhibit a biological function, rather than merely being transcriptional noise. Thus, this work may provide new insight into the study of secondary growth of plants.4.1. Prediction of potential targets and functional motifs of Populus lncRNAs revealed that they may be involved in wood biosynthesisFunctional characterization of lncRNAs remains at an early stage. The commonly used methods for lncRNA functional prediction are based on protein binding,52 epigenetic modi<U+FB01>cation,53 co-expression networks,54 and miRNA regulation.55 Here, we employed a target prediction programme for Populus lncRNAs based on adjacent gene functions (cis-regulation) and sequence complementarity (trans-regulation). A total of 1,994 (12.6%) lncRNAs were DE between/within high-biomass and low-biomass pools (Fig. 3A), comparable to protein-coding genes (8,573) under the same differential expression threshold. This comparison supports the idea that the lncRNAs have a biological purpose and are subject to complex transcriptional regulation during wood biosynthesis. Interestingly, lncRNAs in mature xylem exhibited more (2- to 3-fold) differential expression compared with vascular cambium and developing xylem from the high- and low-biomass pools, although approximately evenly split between genes that were differentially up- and down-regulated in each pair-wise comparison (Fig. 3A). This may suggest that the regulation of lncRNAs is subject to transcriptional rearrangement during wood biosynthesis and more lncRNAs are involved in xylem development.The importance of transcriptional regulation is illustrated by the coordinated expression of speci<U+FB01>c classes of genes in related biological processes occurring at speci<U+FB01>c stages of wood formation, which initiates in the vascular cambium and involves cell division, expansion, secondary wall formation and lignification in developing xylem, and finally, programmed cell death to form mature xylem.56 Supporting this, using a target prediction programme for the DE lncRNAs, we found many important PTGs encoding cell division and expansion proteins, cell wall-associated proteins, and stress-responsive proteins, as well as many transcription factors, including 31 PTGs in the phenylpropanoid pathway. GO analysis showed that the PTGs of lncRNAs highly expressed in mature xylem were enriched in many biological processes related to programmed cell death; however, the PTGs of lncRNAs highly expressed in vascular cambium and developing xylem were assigned to many GO terms, such as ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’, ‘polysaccharide biosynthetic process’, ‘cell morphogenesis’, and ‘response to hormone stimulus’ (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, our observation of the activation of lncRNAs in mature xylem and relatively little difference between vascular cambium and developing xylem is expected. Additionally, we found that the PTGs of lncRNAs DE between these two pools were significantly enriched in many represented biological processes, such as ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’, ‘oxidation reduction’, ‘response to hormone stimulus’, and ‘regulation of protein stability’ (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that the coordinated regulation of lncRNAs and their potential targets in these biological processes may be responsible for the differentiation between these two biomass pools.Noteworthily, all the target genes of lncRNAs predicted in our study are potential targets and need further experimental confirmation in future studies. Although the functions of lncRNAs remain largely unknown, previous studies have reported that lncRNAs may participate in various biological processes without the need to be mutually exclusive. Given the complex functions of lncRNAs and the limited strategies that merely rely on cis-/trans-regulation for the prediction of lncRNA targets in this study, more target genes likely remain to be explored and other approaches for prediction of target genes for lncRNAs need to be applied.4.2. Populus lncRNAs may play roles in miRNA-mediated regulatory networks in secondary wall formationMiRNAs function to destabilize mRNAs and repress the translation of protein-coding genes and play essential roles in plant development and physiology.57 Moreover, interesting cross-regulation between miRNAs and lncRNAs has recently become apparent,58 implying that lncRNAs may interact with miRNAs apart from protein-coding genes. Thus, the intriguing mechanism of lncRNA–miRNA crosstalk may reveal a new layer of functions of lncRNAs. Indeed, in the present study, we identified 476 lncRNAs as potential targets of 213 miRNAs from 90 families (Supplementary Material S9). Among these miRNA families targeting lncRNAs, the stress-responsive miRNA, ptc-miR473a, which plays an important role in biosynthesis of cell wall metabolites and plant development,59 exhibits near-perfectly complementarity to its target TCONS_00108161. Also, we found that TCONS_00078539 was predicted to be the potential target of miR168, which could be involved in auxin signaling and secondary cell wall biosynthesis.60,61 In addition, ptr-miR397, which could be a negative regulator of laccase genes affecting LiC,62 was predicted to target three lncRNAs (TCONS_00013182, TCONS_00015036, and TCONS_00028534). These results indicated that Populus lncRNAs may play roles in secondary cell wall biosynthesis and wood formation as potential targets of many regulatory miRNAs.Target mimicry is a recently identified mechanism of miRNA regulation initially studied in Arabidopsis,7 and subsequently in mammals;63 lncRNAs can act as miRNA decoys or sponges to sequester miRNAs, thus favouring the expression of repressed target mRNAs. Indeed, many eTMs have been functionally confirmed in Arabidopsis and rice.32 In our study, 28 lncRNAs were predicted to be eTMs of 14 miRNAs (Supplementary Material S10). Interestingly, consistent with the previous studies,51,64 we identified novel eTMs for four miRNAs (miR160, miR164, miR169, and miR482a.1). This may indicate that eTM-mediated regulation for these four miRNAs may be pervasive in plants. For example, miR164, which may affect lignin metabolism by regulating transcription factors that control secondary growth and wood composition,65 was predicted to be absorbed by five eTMs. Additionally, in some cases, like miR408, which is involved in lignin deposition and polymerization,59 might target seven lncRNAs and be absorbed by three eTMs. Therefore, based on these analyses, we infer that these lncRNAs potentially function via interacting with miRNAs in complicated networks involving interactions among lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, all the findings are mainly based on our bioinformatics prediction, and the specific regulatory mechanism requires further investigation and validation, such as the cellular localization of miRNAs and lncRNAs predicted as miRNA targets and eTMs using in situ hybridization. We believe that the emergence of important roles for lncRNAs in secondary cell wall biosynthesis and tree growth and our investigation of lncRNA–miRNA interaction network may provide an important resource for further studies.4.3. Allelic variations of Populus lncRNAs and their PTGs indicated that they were associated with growth and wood propertiesAssociation mapping provides a valuable tool allowing us to identify the natural allelic variation responsible for a particular phenotype.66 In this study, we performed association studies for lncRNAs and PTGs, integrating additive, dominant, and epistatic effects of allelic variations underlying wood biosynthesis and stem biomass. Thus, this study initiated the dissection of potential genetic regulatory mechanisms involving lncRNAs and their PTGs. In total, 1,163 unique SNPs from lncRNAs and their PTGs were significantly associated with growth and wood properties based on single-SNP associations (Table 1). Also, ~28% (329 of 1,163) SNPs were associated with at least two traits and each trait could be associated with 6 SNPs (H) to 666 SNPs (DBH) (Table 1), consistent with a previous study that genetic association studies often found that a locus associated with multiple, sometimes seemingly distinct traits. This observation also highlights the possibility that traits share common genetic pathways and underscores the relevance of pleiotropy.67 Intriguingly, ~77% of the lncRNAs and their corresponding PTGs associated with at least one trait in common. For example, we found that SNPs within the lncRNA TCONS_00059927 and its potential cis PTGs simultaneously associated with HoC and V under additive/dominant effects (Fig. 6), indicating the potential genetic interaction between the lncRNA and its corresponding target genes in the pathways underlying this complex genetic network.In quantitative genetics, epistasis, defined as the interaction between genotypes at two or more loci, is an important component of the genetic basis of complex traits and can also involve modification of the additive or dominant effects of the interacting loci. Therefore, phenotypic variations cannot be predicted simply by summing the effects of individual loci.68 At the gene level, epistasis is a phenomenon whereby the effects of a given gene on a biological trait are masked or enhanced by one or more other genes.69 Previous studies have documented that epistasis analysis has considerable potential to reveal interactions between genes and pathways.70 In this study, we detected 17,656 significant SNP-SNP epistatic pairs, covering 8.6% of all investigated SNPs, associated with tree growth and wood properties (Table 3). Interestingly, we did not observe significant additive and/or dominant effects within these epistatic pairs. The result revealed pervasive epistatic effects among allelic mutations without significant main effects in the natural population of Populus, supporting the idea that epistasis plays a key role in genetic architecture and also providing essential information for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of gene interactions.68Examining a specific pathway, we found an epistatic interaction network among 8 lncRNAs and 15 PTGs involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway (Fig. 4B). Among the 15 target genes, we detected 36 epistatic pairs across all 10 traits (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the steps in the pathway, we found Ptr-4CL had epistatic interactions with its upstream gene Ptr-PAL, which encodes the first enzyme of the pathway and also the two downstream genes Ptr-HCT and Ptr-CHS, which encode enzymes assigned to the two different branches in the pathway (Fig. 4C). In addition, we identified epistatic interactions between genes where the biological evidence for how they interacted had not yet been found (Fig. 4C). Intriguingly, our results are consistent with studies in vertebrates and sponges, where lncRNAs have been shown to be highly interconnected with multiple protein-coding genes based on expression profiles.2,71 In the epistatic network, 24 interacting pairs between 8 lncRNAs and 12 genes showed that the lncRNAs can have epistatic interactions with their corresponding target genes and also interact with other non-target genes predicted by our target prediction programme, suggesting that the lncRNAs may interact with their target genes by different mechanisms in the pathway. However, the precise mechanisms underlying such gene–gene interactions are largely unknown. Our findings therefore may provide a reference for follow-up studies to further explore this hypothesis. Collectively, our epistasis analysis of lncRNAs and their potential targets genes may enrich the interaction networks among genes in the pathway, since these genes may be part of a common regulatory network.Accession numberSRA accession: SRP073689.Conflict of interestNone declared.

In this study, we provide, for the first time, a genome picture of numts inserted in the pig nuclear genome. The Sus scrofa reference nuclear genome (Sscrofa10.2) was aligned with circularized and consensus mtDNA sequences using LAST software. A total of 430 numt sequences that may represent 246 different numt integration events (57 numt regions determined by at least two numt sequences and 189 singletons) were identified, covering about 0.0078% of the nuclear genome. Numt integration events were correlated (0.99) to the chromosome length. The longest numt sequence (about 11 kbp) was located on SSC2. Six numts were sequenced and PCR amplified in pigs of European commercial and local pig breeds, of the Chinese Meishan breed and in European wild boars. Three of them were polymorphic for the presence or absence of the insertion. Surprisingly, the estimated age of insertion of two of the three polymorphic numts was more ancient than that of the speciation time of the Sus scrofa, supporting that these polymorphic sites were originated from interspecies admixture that contributed to shape the pig genome.1. IntroductionEukaryotic genomes have been shaped by the insertion of new sequences of different origin into nuclear DNA, largely influencing their architecture and evolution.1 A particular source of new sequences is provided by the horizontal transfer of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments (from both coding and non-coding regions) into the nuclear genome, producing nuclear DNA sequences of mitochondrial origin (numts).2,Numts, which have been frequently discovered inadvertently in the search for bona fide mtDNA3, represent sequence fossils present in the nuclear genome of many eukaryotes, constituting about 0.001–0.1% of its DNA.4 If numts are not recognized in actual mtDNA sequence-based studies, they can compromise result interpretation in detecting heteroplasmy5 or mtDNA pathogenic variants6 or leading to wrong phylogenetic reconstructions.7The transfer of these genetic materials is however an ongoing, but rare, evolutionary process.8 The exact mechanisms by which mtDNA sequences are integrated into the nuclear genome are not completely understood. The most accepted hypothesis suggests that in presence of mutagenic agents or stress conditions, mtDNA fragments can escape from the mitochondrions and their integration into the nuclear genome could occur during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.4,9,Numts, similarly to other inserted elements, have been used as evolutionary markers by analysing orthologous regions in related species and considering their presence or absence as indications of species radiation times.5,10Several livestock genomes have been recently analysed to evaluate the presence and distribution of numts. Most of these studies have been based only on genome mining using BLAST search of mtDNA sequence in the available genome versions. Pereira and Baker11 investigated a draft sequence of the chicken genome showing a relatively low number of numts in the avians compared with mammals. Liu and Zhao5 reported a preliminary analysis of the cattle genome using a partial unassembled sequence version. Hazkani-Covo et al.4 interrogated all genomes publicly available at that time (i.e. 2010), including cattle, chicken, rabbit and horse genomes. The horse genome was also interrogated by Nergadze et al.12 who reported polymorphic numts segregating within species.The Sus scrofa genome has been recently published and the current released version (Sscrofa10.2), available since August 2011, from the Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium (SGSC), accounts for about 3 billions of base pairs.13 The genome of S.scrofa contains signature of inter-species gene flow that indicates reticulate inter taxa crossbreeding events in the constitution of Sus species, involving species of the Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) biodiversity hotspots.14 The domestication processes of S.scrofa occurred independently from European and Asian wild boars whose common ancestors diverged about 1 million of years before present (MYBP).15,16 Then, modern European pig breeds and lines were influenced by the introduction in the XVIII–XIX centuries of Asian blood into European populations.16,17In this work, we identified and analysed numts in the pig reference genome which, to our best knowledge, is the first comprehensive study in this species that considered mtDNA insertions in the nuclear genome. Phylogenetic analyses provided estimations of numt insertional events during the evolutionary lineage of the Suinae subfamily. We also revealed that polymorphic numts (i.e. presence/absence of insertions) segregate in different pig breeds and can provide interesting signatures to capture reticulate evolutionary events between Sus species and information useful to understand the domestication processes of the pig and the constitution of pig breeds.2. Materials and methods2.1. Search for numts within the S.scrofa nuclear genomeThe unmasked reference pig genome was retrieved from Ensembl (Sscrofa10.2, GCA_000003025.4). It includes the porcine reference mtDNA sequence in linear form. Other full-length S.scrofa mtDNA sequences were retrieved from GenBank: these sequences were from different European originated pig breeds (Duroc: the reference mtDNA sequence; Hampshire, AY574046.1; Large White, KC250275.1; Mangalitsa, KJ746666.1) and European wild boar (FJ236998.1) as well as from different Asian originated pig breeds (Jeuma, KP223728.1; Longlin, KM433673.1; Rongchang, KM044239.1; Sandu-black, KM094194.1; Wuji, KM259826.1). A consensus sequence of all ten (European + Asian) mtDNA sequences was obtained by analysing multiple aligned sequences, generated with Multiple Sequence Alignment Tool MUSCLE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/), with the CONS software at the EMBOSS-explorer web server (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/emboss-explorer/). Since mtDNA is circular, two linearized mtDNA sequences with the same consensus origin were concatenated to each other, so that subsequent comparison methods could not miss the possibility to identify matches at the beginning or at the end of a linearized single sequence due to boundary effects.This concatenated consensus sequence was used to query the reference S.scrofa nuclear genome using LAST software.18 LAST software has been considered to better perform than BLAST in detecting numts as it can be tuned with parameters that can capture low identity expected when aligning old numts to modern mtDNA.18 LAST alignment parameters were: +1 for matches, -1 for mismatches, 7 for gap-open penalty and 1 for gap-extension penalty, that are suitable for detecting distant homology.19 LAST software gives a score based on the expected number of alignments of a random sequence with the same length as the query and a random sequence with the same length as the database. To identify a threshold score for LAST in this approach that minimizes the risk of identifying false positives matches, we followed what was proposed by Tsuji et al.20 using the reversed mitochondrial genome approach. The reversed mtDNA genome was obtained by simply reversing, without complementing, its sequence. This sequence was aligned to the reference nuclear pig genome. Any match between this newly generated sequence and the nuclear genome can be considered to be spurious as DNA sequences do not evolve by simple reversal.20 The number of matches that could be obtained by chance in this test is reported in Supplementary Table S1. A score of 37, which gives an expected probability equal to 0.000734 to identify spurious matches in our analysis, was set as score threshold to identify significant matches.2.2. Analyses of numt regionsAll LAST matches including overlapping sequences or consecutive sequences on the same chromosome were visually inspected using dot plot graphs produced with the ggplot2 R programme (y axis: the mtDNA consensus sequence; x axis: the nuclear genome sequence). Consecutive matches on both axes were considered to identify a numt region derived by a unique insertional event followed by subsequent insertions/deletions of other origin. Other events (i.e. duplications, rearrangements or non-unique insertions) were identified when more complex patterns in consecutive nuclear sequences were evident, compared with the mtDNA sequence (and considered as complex events).The genomic context of the regions flanking the detected numts was analysed to identify: (i) repetitive elements (1,000 bp from both sides from the inserted numts) using RepeatMasker version 4.0.6 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/); (ii) GC content in the 1,000 bp flanking regions of the numt sequences; (iii) the position of insertion (intergenic, intronic, coding exons, 5' and 3' untranslated regions); (iv) the closest annotated gene in the Sscrofa10.2 genome version.2.3. Identification of polymorphic numt insertionsBlood or muscle samples were used to extract DNA from a total of 66 pigs belonging to 3 commercial breeds (36 Italian Large White, 15 Italian Landrace, 15 Italian Duroc), 77 pigs from 5 Italian local pig breeds (16 Cinta Senese, 16 Mora Romagnola, 17 Casertana, 10 Apulo Calabrese, 18 Nero Siciliano), 13 European wild boars and 6 pigs from the Chinese Meishan breed. DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer protocols and used for PCR analyses of six selected numts. Numts were chosen considering different criteria: (i) different levels of homology of the numt against the modern mtDNA sequence; (ii) different chromosomes; (iii) possibility to design unique primers (i.e. absense of repetead sequences in the flanking regions, as determid by RepeatMasker version 4.0.6; http://www.repeatmasker.org/); (iv) insertion size of about 200–250 bp to facilitate amplification reactions. Primer3Plus (http://primer3plus.com/web_3.0.0/primer3web_input.htm) programme was used to design PCR primers within about 150 bp of the flanking regions of the six selected numts. PCR primers and PCR conditions are reported in Supplementary Table S2. A 2,720 thermal cycler (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for amplification reactions (the following temperature profile was used: 5 min at 95 °C; 35 amplification cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at the specific annealing temperature reported in Supplementary Table S2, 30 s at 72 °C; 5 min at 72 °C) that were carried out with the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, on a 20 µl final reaction volume that contained about 50 ng of template porcine DNA. Amplified fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and visualized with 1× GelRed Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). Amplicons obtained from all primer pairs for at least six different animals were used for Sanger sequencing. Amplified fragments from homozygous animals were purified from the PCR reactions using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA) or ethanol precipitation. Fragments from heterozygous animals were isolated from gels cutting the band of interest that was purified with the Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Purified fragments were sequenced using the BrightDye Terminatior Cycle Sequencing Kit (Nimagen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands), and loaded on ABI3100 Avant capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All sequences were visually inspected and aligned with the help of CodonCode Aligner (version 5.1.5) software (http://www.codoncode.com/aligner/). Obtained sequences were aligned to the Sscrofa10.2 reference genome or to the expected numt flanking regions without numt insertion using BLASTN.2.4. Phylogenetic analysesAn ancestral mtDNA sequence was inferred using all publicly available and complete mtDNA sequences of Suinae species (subfamily of the Suidae family) that diverged about 10 MYBP.21 Sequences were from: Phacochoerus africanus (GenBank accession number: DQ409327), Potamochoerus porcus (JN632688), S.scrofa (mtDNA from Sscrofa10.2 reference genome), Sus celebensis (KM203891), Sus cebifrons (KF952600), Sus verrucosus (KF926379), Sus barbatus (KP789021). mtDNA sequences were aligned as described above and the consensus sequence was obtained with the CONS software (see above). The age of each numt inserted in the Sscrofa10.2 genome version was calculated according to Dayama et al.23 as follows: (i) each numt sequence was aligned to the previously aligned ancestral Suinae and modern mtDNA sequences; (ii) the total number of sites in the aligned regions where the ancestral and modern mitochondrial sequences differ were counted (ancestral_vs_modern); (iii) of these variable positions, the numt sequence that matched the modern mtDNA sequences was tabulated (numt_vs_modern); (iv) the allele matching ratio (amr) was calculated: amr = (numt_vs_modern)/(ancestral_vs_modern), and used to estimate when the insertion occurred along the Suinae lineage (insertion before present, ibp), considering 10 MYBP its divergence period, as follows: ibp = (1 – amr) × 10, expressed in MYBP. Numts that contained D-loop sequences were not used for age estimation due to their uncertaintly in predicting ancestral D-loop sequences. The ibp was also computed for numt regions derived by unique insertional events (defined earlier) by summing, for the different LAST matches, numt_vs_modern and ancestral_vs_modern to obtain a single allele matching ratio for each numt region. Phylogenetic trees were obtained for the validated numt (Table 1) and the largest numt insertions (>500 bp). Numt sequences were aligned (using MUSCLE software) with the corresponding mtDNA sequence of all Suinae species reported earlier in addition to the mtDNA sequences of Pecari tajacu (Tajassuidae species, Suidae; accession number AP003427) and Bos taurus (AY526085), downloaded from GenBank. Trees were built with MEGA 7.0.1822 using Maximum-Likelihood method (applying default options) with 1,000 bootstrap values.23Supplementary Material S1 includes sequences used for the phylogenetic analyses. To evaluate the presence of ancient numt insertions in the genome of first closest species to the pig for which an annotated genome is available (the cattle genome, UMD3.1 genome version), LAST analysis (with the B.taurus mtDNA sequence indicated above and using parameters described for the mining of the pig genome) was carried out in the cattle genome. Numt insertions were declared orthologous by comparative mapping analysis using annotated regions in the two pig and cattle nuclear genomes and by veryfing the insertion of homologous mtDNA regions in two species using BLASTN.

Results3.1. Identification of numt sequences in the pig nuclear reference genomeMining the assembled and the unassembled (scaffolds) of the nuclear reference genome Sscrofa10.2 with LAST and a consensus modern mtDNA sequence obtained from European and Chinese pigs, we identified 401 and 29 significant matches (LAST score >37), respectively, belonging to numt sequences (Supplementary Material S3). Identity of these matched nuclear sequences with the modern mtDNA sequence ranged from 60 to 100% (mean of 78%). The lower value may indicate the detection limit of our approach. Distribution of numt sequences according to their size is presented in Table 2. Numt sequence lenght varied from 42 to 4,782 bp with an oulier of about 11 kbp integrated on porcine chromosome (SSC) 2, with 90% identity with the modern porcine mtDNA sequence.

Table 3 and Fig. 1 show the distribution of numt sequences in the different porcine chromosomes and their positions. Porcine chromosome (SSC) 14 showed the largest proportion of numts (~0.02% of its size was covered by these sequences with also the largest number of detected numt sequences; n = 60) whereas SSC5 was covered by the lowest proportion of these integrated nuclear mtDNAs (~0.001%). There is a modest linear relationship between the number of numts located on each chromosome and their relative length (Pearson’s r = 0.65, P-value = 0.003). The average distance between two close numts in the reference porcine genome is 6.5 Mbp (ranging from a few bp to 70 Mbp).

Numt positions are represented in the Sscrofa10.2 assembled chromosomes.Close numt sequences could identify unique insertional events into the nuclear genome that underwent subsequent deletions or insertions (and/or other complex rearrangements) separating contiguous mtDNA regions that we however identified as separate numt sequences using LAST. To evaluate this issue, we dot-plotted all nuclear regions including numt sequences separated by up to 20 kb against the modern mtDNA sequence. We then called independent numt regions (derived by unique numt insertional events) according to the possibility to infer contiguity based on the integration of mtDNA sequences into the nuclear genome. Other numt regions included complex rearrangements or duplications that could not be possible to consider as derived by one or more than one insertional event. Figure 2 shows a few examples of numt regions that could be described as derived by unique insertional events or that could be considered as complex numt regions, including duplications and rearrangements. Of the total 430 numt sequences that matched the modern mtDNA sequence with LAST, using the dot plot approach we could identify 57 numt regions including at least two numt sequences (54 numt regions in the assembled reference genome and 3 in the unassembled scaffolds) and 189 singleton numt sequences, accounting for a total of 246 separated numt integrations in the reference porcine nuclear genome. Of these 57 numt regions, 51 were considered as derived by independent insertional events and 6 were defined as complex numt regions. Detailed information on all numt regions and putative independent integrations are reported in Supplementary Material S3. Linear relationship between the number of numt integrations located on each chromosome and their relative length increased substantially (Pearson’s r = 0.99, P-value < 0.001). The average distance between two close numt integrations in the reference porcine genome is 11.3 Mbp. Dot-plot analysis of a few numt regions.

Details of these regions are reported in Supplementary Table S3. Different coloured lines in the plots indicate different numt sequences.As the accuracy of the assembly of the available pig reference genome (Sscrofa10.2) is limited, it could be possible that a few numts derive by misassemblies. However, as almost all numt sequences had identity lower than 100% (similarity ranged from 60 to 100%, median similarity was 77%) with the modern porcine mtDNA (indication of evolutionary divergence), it seems plausible to exclude assembly errors that would have included true mtDNA fragments into the nuclear genome. The only two short numts with 100% identity with the modern mtDNA are compatible with a recent insertion into the nuclear genome (Supplementary Material S3). Other sources of misassemblies could have been produced by duplications of numt sequences even if a close inspection of the results did not identify any obvious problem originated by duplicated regions of the porcine genome.Figure 3 shows (i) the distribution of numts along the circularized mtDNA genome with indications of nuclear porcine chromosome in which the corresponding numt was integrated (Fig. 3a) and (ii) the distribution of numt hits in the linearized mtDNA sequence at the different nucleotides (Fig. 3b). If we just exclude the variable repeated region of the control region, for which alignments were problematic due to highly variable number of repeats, all mtDNA regions were covered at least once by numt sequences (Fig. 3b). The most covered mtDNA regions by numts included parts of the COX1, COX2 and 16S-rRNA genes. It was also interesting to note that the D-loop of the control mtDNA region, a non-coding region of the mitochondrial genome that controls the synthesis of DNA and RNA within the mitochondria and that usually exhibits a higher mutation rate than the other regions of the mtDNA, was covered by 34 numts.

Characteristics of numt insertion regionsNumts were found to be slightly preferentially inserted in regions with higher GC content (flanking regions have a GC% equal to 42%, compared with the overal GC content of the pig nuclear genome that is 39%). RepeatMasker analysis of the numt flanking sequences determined that only 8% (64 cases out of all 802 flanking regions analysed) includes non-repetitive sequences. Therefore, most numt flanking regions contain repetitive elements (Supplementary Material S3). The most frequent reported repetitive elements were short interspersed nuclear elements or SINE (48% of numts are nearby SINE elements). The second most frequent repetitive elements were long interspersed nuclear elements or LINE (24%). The overall SINE and LINE content of the pig genome is 11 and 16%, respectively,13,24 therefore it is clear that numt sequences are preferentially located near or within repetitive elements in the S.scrofa genome (P < 0.0001, chi square test).A total of 57 numt sequences out of 430 numts detected in the S.scrofa genome (from 51 different numt regions or singletons) were located within 49 different annotated genes. All numts were in intronic regions. All other numt sequences were located in intergenic regions. Details on the closest gene to all detected numts (as annotated in Sscrofa10.2) are reported in Supplementary Material S3. Gene functional enrichment of the closest annotated gene to all identified numts did not identify any enriched function or features (data not shown).3.3. Validation of numts and identification of polymorphic numts (presence/absence of insertion)Six primer pairs were designed to validate the presence of numt insertions in pigs belonging to Chinese (Meishan) and Euro-American pig breeds (three commercial and five local breeds) and European wild boars. At the same time these primers could verify if polymorphic numt regions derived by the presence of absence of the inserted numt could be detected from this panel of animals. Features of the amplified numts are reported in Table 1. Three primer pairs designed for numts 4_19 (identity with the corresponding modern mtDNA: ~87%), 15_09 (identity: ~86%) and 16_02 (identity: ~93%), respectively, produced the expected fragment size (Table 1, including the inserted numt sequence as confirmed by sequencing) in all analysed pigs across all breeds and European wild boars. Amplifications obtained for three other numts (3_15, identity: 99%; 8_10, identity: 92%; and 13_32, identity: 90%) showed fragments of lower size than that expected (Fig. 4). Sequences of these fragments confirmed the absence of numt sequences in these amplicons (EMBL accession numbers: LT707411 for numt 3_15; LT707414, for numt 8_10; LT707412 for numt 13_32; see Fig. 5 for the sequence alignments between genomic regions with the presence and the absence of the numts).

The sequence indicated as ‘with_numt’ is identical to the Sscrofa10.2 reference region, the sequence defined as ‘without_numt’ indicates the sequence obtained by Sanger sequencing of the fragments that do not include the numt (Fig. 4). These regions where polymorphic in the population and their sequence were submitted in EMBL database with the following accession numbers: Numt 3_15, LT707410 with numt, LT707411 without numt; Numt 8_10, LT707410 with numt, LT707411 without numt; Numt 13_32, LT707412 without numt, the sequence with numt is the same present in Sscrofa10.2.

For numt 3_15, polymorphic insertions (i.e. presence of two alleles: one with the numt sequence and one without this insertion) were observed in two local pig breeds (Apulo Calabrese and Nero Siciliano, with two genotypes only) and in the Chinese Meishan, with the same frequency of all three genotypes in just six animals analysed. All other breeds were fixed for the insertion allele. For numt 8_10, presence/absense polymorphism was observed in Italian Large White, Italian Landrace, Italian Duroc and Nero Siciliano breeds in which the insertion allele was always the most frequent. All other breeds were fixed for inserted allele. Polymorphism derived by the presence/absence of the numt 13_32 was observed in Meishan and Italian Large White pigs in which the absence of insertion allele was the most frequent or was close to 50% and in three local breeds (Cinta Senese, Apulo Calabrese and Nero Siciliano) in which the insertion allele was far the most frequent. In all other breeds, the insertion allele for numt 13_32 was fixed. All European wild boars investigated were homozygous for the insertion allele at al three numt loci.

Phylogenetic analysis of numtsWe estimated when the insertional events occurred in the Suinae lineage by comparing modern mtDNA sequences with a consensus Suinae mtDNA sequence and identifying diagnostic sites in the numt sequences. Table 1 reports the estimated age of insertion of validated numts. Information for all numts (for which alignments and detection of diagnostic sites were possible) is reported in Supplementary Material S3. Age of numts ranged from 10 MYBP (the back limit of our approach derived by the use of a Suinae consensus sequence used to identify informative nucleotides) to very recent integration times (<0.5 MYBP). The largest numt spanning about 11 kb of the modern mtDNA, located on SSC2, was estimated to be inserted in the porcine nuclear genome about 7.7 MYBP (numt 2_25 in Supplementary Material S3). Phylogenetic trees placed more divergent numt sequences (identity <80% with the modern mtDNAs) before the Tajassuidae lineage separation or even out from the B.taurus root. Confirmation of the presence of orthologous numt sequences in the bovine genome was obtained by comparing numts identified within the regions that are syntenic between S.scrofa and B.taurus genomes. Orthologous numts are reported in Supplementary Material S3 with their respective bovine nuclear and mitochondrial coordinates. Five of them, namely 9_09, 10_10, 15_15, 18_05 and 18_06 were located within the orthologuos bovine genes (within the same intron), and in both species with identity from 63 to 71%, further indicating that the insertion was not recent and originated by a unique event that occurred in a common ancestral genome.Results of phylogenetic analyses for the polymorphic numts indicated that the range of insertion age spanned a surprisingly large period of time if referred in the Suinae evolutionary line. In particular, all diagnostic sites of numt 3_15 were present in the modern mtDNA suggesting that its insertion was recent (below the resolution time of 1 MYBP) and probably after the separation of the common ancestral wild boar lineage from which the Asian and European pigs were domesticated. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction confirmed the recent insertion of this numt (Fig. 6). As most of European breeds are fixed for this insertion (Table 4), we could speculate that this numt was inserted during the European evolutionary differentiation within the S.scrofa species. Insertion of this numt might derive from a European wild boar ancestor of this lineage. Then this polymorphic site could have been introgressed into Asian domestic breeds as Meishan pigs show both alleles (presence and absence of the insertion). Phylogenetic trees of four numt sequences reported as examples, three of which (numts 3_15, 8_10 and 13_32, indicated in red in the trees) were the polymorphic numts. The number at each node indicates the bootstrap frequency.Phylogenetic trees of four numt sequences reported as examples, three of which (numts 3_15, 8_10 and 13_32, indicated in red in the trees) were the polymorphic numts. The number at each node indicates the bootstrap frequency.Numt 8_10 was estimated to be inserted about 5 MYBP (Table 1) as also confirmed by the phylogenetic tree analysis that placed it before the separation of all considered Sus species (Fig. 6). As Meishan breed was fixed for the inserted allele and all commercial European domestic pig breeds were polymorphic at numt 8_10, it is possible to speculate that the absence allele was introgressed into European populations from Asian pigs, that in turn might have acquired the old allele (absence of the numt sequence) from interspecific admixture with other Sus species living in the ISEA closely in contact with Sus species of the Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). This interspecific gene flow may explain the age of this numt and at the same time the fact that it is not fixed in the S.scrofa (as it might be considering the estimated age before the Sus lineage differentiation).Estimation of the insertion age for numt 13_32 indicated about 6.7 MYBP. The topology of the phylogenetic tree including this numt was more difficult to be interpreted according to the evolutionary relationships between the Sus and the other Suinae taxa included in this study (Fig. 6). This might be due to differences in information content of different parts of the mtDNA. The position of numt 13_32 however may indicate an ancient integregation age that probably occurred before the separation of the Sus species (late Miocene/early Pliocene). In addition, the presence of polymorphisms in both modern European and Asian S.scrofa breeds and populations (Table 1) might indicate again a possible introgression of the ‘absence’ allele of putative Asian origin (not fixed in Asian breeds) into European domestic pigs, similarly to what might have been happened for numt 8_10.4. DiscussionEvolution of eukaryotic genomes has been affected by the acquisition of new sequences of many different origins into the nuclear DNA. For example, in mammals mobile or transposable elements (the most important class of acquired elements) accounts for nearly half of their genomes1. The role and impact of the insertion of LINE and SINE and retroviruses into the nuclear genome have been investigated in many species, including farm animals. These insertions could be particularly relevant when genes were targeted, contributing to define novel functions and structures.25 Inserted elements may also provide phylogenetic information among related species, considering their ancient signature derived by their integration position (uniqueness) in an ancestral genome.26,27 This ancestral signature has been used to reconstruct the history of domestication in animals.28 In humans, model animals and livestock species, more recent mutagenic insertional events, polymorphic within species, have been reported to cause a number of diseases and novel phenotypes.29–31Most of the eukaryotic genomes so far analysed have demonstrated the presence of mtDNA sequences into the nuclear genome.4 As expected, also for the S.scrofa nuclear genome we reported evidence for the transfer of mtDNA to the nuclear genome. The fraction of the ‘contaminated’ nuclear genome of the pig (0.0078%) is within the range already observed in several other mammals. For example, the percentage of the nuclear human and cattle genomes covered by numts was reported to be 0.0087 and 0.0023%, respectively.4 A few differences among studies carried out within the same species (e.g. humans) might be due to different mining approaches and applied thresholds to declare homology between nuclear DNA and mtDNA sequences.4,20 Following what was suggested by Tsuji et al.,20 who mined the genome of several mammals to find numts, we used the LAST programme to perform local sequence alignments instead of BLAST. Also in our hands, LAST was able to identify a larger number of numt sequences compared with BLAST (a total of 89 BLAST hits were identified in the Sscrofa10.2, e-value < 0.001) that did not capture more divergent sequences derived by ancient integrations (that underwent several mutational differentiation processes) or complex rearrangements (data not shown).Dot-plot analysis of numts indicated that a quite large number of porcine numt sequences could be derived by a single insertional event that subsequently underwent additional mutations as part of the evolutionary processes of the nuclear genome. A total of 247 separated insertional events (with 56 numt regions derived by more than one numt sequence) could be inferred after this close inspection of the inserted nuclear genomic regions. This analysis indicated that most of the complex numt regions were derived by nuclear mutations that split the integrated mtDNA in separated but co-linear regions with a few exceptions that included more complex rearrangements with duplications and invertions (Fig. 2). Most of the complex numt regions were estimated to be caused by very ancient mtDNA integration events in the nuclear genome of this species (at least 10 MYBP that is the back limit defined by our consensus mtDNA sequence).All mtDNA regions were present in porcine numts, including D-loop sequences. Tsuji et al.20 suggested that the D-loop region is under-represented in human numts as a specific effect of numt integration bias of the primate evolutionary lineage. This might not be true for the pig genome in which a quite large number of numts covered these highly polymorphic mtDNA regions. As this porcine mtDNA region has been used several times in population genetic studies and phylogenetic analyses16,32 due to the presence of frequent informative polymorphisms, it will be important to carefully evaluate if unintentioned amplified numts could have been a source of unexpected variability in supposed mtDNA sequences. This problem could be relevant not only for the D-loop region but also for all other informative mtDNA regions used for different purposes. A recent analysis of livestock mtDNA sequences deposited in DNA databases33 reported that of 127 near complete porcine mtDNA sequences available in GenBank, about 32% contained errors. For almost half of these problematic sequences the surplus of mutations observed in these entries was probably due to contamination from numt sequences. This problem might be also present in many other partial porcine mtDNA sequences deposited in public databases. As numts are not under strong selective constrains of the mitochondrial genome, they might usually contain pseudogene signatures (if they come from protein-coding regions) that can be used to distinguish them from true mtDNA sequencs (i.e. frameshift mutations, premature stop codons, inserions and deletions). However, recent transferred sequences that have not accululated these characteristics yet and numts from non-coding mtDNA regions might be more cryptic to be detected.7 A closer inspection of this possible source of biases in mtDNA studies can be now possible using as reference the porcine numt sequences we identified.Insertion position of porcine numts seems to co-localize with two classes of retrotransposon sequences (i.e. SINE and LINE). Similar co-localization on repeated regions has been reported for numts in a few mammalian genomes including the human genome,20,23 further confirming a general feature that shapes the distribution of numts in mammals. The precise mechanism by which this occurs is not understood yet. This more frequent co-localization feature can hold even if the position of numts in the reference porcine genome (as well as in all other analysed mammalian genomes) may reflect a non-random sample of numt insertion events that were probably filtered out from deleterious events. This is true considering that only a fraction of the mammalian genome (10–15%) is functional34 and may accept the introduction of novel DNA during its evolutionary processes. All detected porcine numts were inserted in intergenic regions (n = 195) or in intronic regions (n = 51) and a potential functional role of these insertions was not obvious. Althought in most cases these insertions might be neutral, it could be possible that in rare cases numts are inserted into genes as already described in humans, producing genetic diseases or altered phenotypes.35–38 Additional S.scrofa genomes might be investigated to identify other numts not present in the reference genome version used in this study. Dayama et al.23 showed in humans that more recent numt sequences could be discovered when other genomes were analysed for the presence of this type of new sequence integration in the nuclear genome.Polymorphic numts (i.e. presence or absence of the inserted mtDNA sequence) were identified to segregate in different pig populations. The presence of allelic numt loci within a species might usually indicate a very recent origin of the insertion events, i.e. after the speciation process. This is what was observed in humans23 and horse,12 the only other two species in which this phenomenon has been described so far. Surprisingly, the estimated age of insertion of two of the three polymorphic numts was more ancient than that of the speciation time of the S.scrofa. The insertion ages of numts 8_10 and 13_32 were estimated to be about 5 MYBP (early Pliocene) and about 6.7 MYBP (late Miocene), respectively, i.e. before the differentiation of the Sus genera or just after the constitution of this lineage. Even if our estimation could not be very precise as it is based only on a few diagnostic mtDNA positions, it seems clear that these insertions were not recent (as also confirmed by the general identity of the two numts with the modern mtDNA: 92 and 90%, respectively). This estimation however contradicts the fact that these numt insertions were not fixed in S.scrofa species. Of the genus Sus, all extant species except S.scrofa (spread across all Euro-Asian regions) are restricted to ISEA region (S.barbatus: in Borneo, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra; S.verrucosus: in Jawa and Bawean; S.cebifrons and Sus philippensis: Philippines; S.celebensis: Sulawesi). Frantz et al.14 demonstrated that the evolutionary history of Sus species can be better explained by a reticulate history derived by many episodes of interspecies admixture. Ai et al.39 reported the presence of a peculiar divergent region, spanning several megabases on SSCX, differentiating southern domestic Chinese breeds (more similar to ISEA species) from northern domestic Chinese breeds (clustering with European sequences). This region constitutes a signature of interspecies admixture that contributed to the latitude adaptation of the two groups of Chinese domestic breeds.39 Ancient polymorphic numts we reported in our study further support the possibility that interspecies gene flow has contributed to shape the S.scrofa genome. Actually, an interesting advantage that numts can provide is derived by their sequence information that contains their approximate age of integration in the nuclear genome. Other numt regions should be tested to obtain a more complete picture of polymorphisms originated during the different events (interspecies admixture or recent insertions) that shaped the modern domestic pig genome and contributed to the constitution of European breeds and lines through different waves of gene flux and introgression between Asian and European domestic populations and breeds.Accession numbersLT707410, LT707411, LT707412, LT707413, LT707414We thank the Italian Pig Breeders Association (ANAS) for providing samples used for DNA analyses.Conflict of interest statementNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingThis work was supported by University of Bologna RFO funds and MiPAAF Innovagen project.

IntroductionSweet cherry (Prunus avium, 2n = 2x = 16) and its tetraploid relatives (Pr. cerasus and Pr. pseudocerasus, 2n = 4x = 32) are fruit crops of the Rosaceae family, which also includes apple (Malus × domestica), peach (Pr. persica), Japanese apricot (Pr. mume), strawberry (Fragaria vesca and F. × ananassa), and Japanese, Chinese, and European pears (Pyrus pyrifolia, Py. bretschneideri, and Py. communis). Because of their economic importance, e.g. the world production of 2.2 M tonnes in 2014 (FAOSTAT: http://www.fao.org/faostat (8 May 2017, date last accessed)), breeding programs for fruit crops are progressing all over the world. However, in general, their breeding efficiency has lagged behind that of the cereal crops and vegetables due to the time and space required to grow them. Because genomics-based breeding could overcome this drawback, whole-genome sequencing has been performed on a number of the Rosaceae crops, including apple,1 peach,2 pear,3,4 Japanese apricot,5 and strawberry,6,7 as well as on >100 other plant species.8Nevertheless, whole-genome sequencing of sweet cherry has not been reported despite its simple, compact genome (2n = 2x = 16, genome size of ~380 Mb). According to sweet cherry genetic maps, the structure of the sweet cherry genome is predicted to be similar to that of the peach genome,9 meaning that the order of markers is conserved between the two species. Moreover, the positions of QTLs for agronomically important traits (e.g. disease resistances, as well as flower, vegetative, and fruit or nut quality) overlap.10 Therefore, genomic information from peaches, as well as other Rosaceae fruiting crops, has already been utilized in sweet cherry breeding.11Even though the marker orders are conserved between sweet cherries and peaches, the genome sequences have diverged.12 A conserved set of orthologous markers bridge the barrier between the genome sequences, but the number of available markers is limited,13 forcing researchers and breeders to develop a high-throughput SNP genotyping system.14 To enhance the breeding programs for sweet cherries and to assist future genetics and genomics studies, we established genomic resources such as whole-genome sequence data, a high-density genetic map, the sweet cherry pseudomolecule based on the genetic map and synteny with the peach genome, and DNA markers using SNPs, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and insertions/deletions identified from whole-genome resequencing of six modern cultivars. In addition, we identified agronomically important genes for fruit color, morphology, and quality and self-incompatibility in the genome. This study will be useful for breeding programs and in genetics and genomics studies on not only sweet cherry but also other members of the Rosaceae family including the sweet cherry relatives, Pr. cerasus and Pr. pseudocerasus, both of which possess complex genomes due to tetraploidy. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing analysis of the sweet cherry genomeA Japanese leading variety of sweet cherry (Pr. avium) (i.e. Satonishiki) was used for genomic sequencing. For genomic diversity analysis, six Japanese varieties (Benikirari, Benisayaka, Benishuho, Benitemari, Beniyutaka, and Nanyo) were used. The pedigree of the materials is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Young leaves from each variety were collected from the original trees (Benikirari, Benitemari, and Beniyutaka) and clones (Satonishiki, Benisayaka, Benishuho, and Nanyo), all of which were planted in the Horticultural Experiment Station at Yamagata Integrated Agricultural Research Center, Japan.Genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used for construction of a paired-end (PE) library (insert size: 500 bp), in accordance with the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). In addition, four mate-pair (MP) libraries (insert sizes of 2, 5, 10, and 15 kb) were constructed with GS Titanium Library Paired End Adaptors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).15 The nucleotide sequences were determined using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina) in PE 93 bp mode.2.2. Genome size estimation and genome assemblyOut of the obtained sequence reads for PE and MP sequencing, low-quality reads were removed and adapter sequences were trimmed using PRINSEQ16 (version 0.20.4: parameters of -trim_right 1, -trim_qual_right 10, and -min_len 92) and fastx_clipper (parameter of -a AGATCGGAAGAGC) in the FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.14: http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit (8 May 2017, date last accessed)), respectively. The filtered high-quality reads were used for genomic size estimation based on k-mer frequency (k = 17) using Jellyfish17 (version 2.1.4).The high-quality PE reads were assembled into contigs using SOAPdenovo218 (version r240: parameters of -F and -R) or Platanus19 (version 1.2.1). In the assembly with SOAPdenovo2, k-mer sizes from 51 to 91 were examined. After comparing the two assemblies, sequence data obtained from SOAPdenovo2 (k-mer = 81) were chosen for scaffolding with high-quality MP reads, which was carried out using SOAPdenovo2. Gaps, represented by Ns in the sequence, were filled with the high-quality PE reads using GapCloser18 (version 1.10: parameter of -p 31). Contaminating sequences were removed by searching with BLASTN, with an E-value cutoff of 1E - 10 and length coverage of =10%, against sequences from potential contaminating sources such as organelles (chloroplasts of peach [accession number: HQ336405], Japanese apricot [accession number: KF765450], and strawberry [accession number: NC_015206], and mitochondria of Arabidopsis [accession number: NC_001284] and apple [accession number: NC_018554]), other organisms (bacterial and fungi genome sequences registered in NCBI [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov], and the human genome [hg19]), and artifacts (Illumina PhiX Sequencing Control v3 and vector sequences from UniVec [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/ (8 May 2017, date last accessed)]). The resulting sequences that were =1,000 bases were selected and designated PAV_r1.0. Completeness of the assembly was assessed with sets of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO)20 (version 1.1b).2.3. Repetitive sequence analysisRepetitive sequences in PAV_r1.0 were identified using Repbase.21 A de novo repeat library for PAV_r1.0 was built using RepeatScout22 (version 1.0.5), and the repetitive sequences were searched for using RepeatMasker23 (version 4.0.3) based on known repetitive sequences registered in Repbase21 and the de novo repeat libraries.2.4. RNA sequencing and assemblyTotal RNA was extracted from leaves, roots, flowers, calli, brown rot fruits infected by Monilinia fructicola, and fruits from three different stages (32 days after full bloom [DAFB], yellow; 44 DAFB, initial red; and 54 DAFB, full red)24 using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) or phenol/SDS extraction, and then treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. RNA libraries were constructed in accordance with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina). The nucleotide sequences were determined using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis on a MiSeq (Illumina) in the PE 301 bp mode. The obtained reads were treated as above to remove low-quality reads and to trim adapter sequences, and were assembled using Trinity25 (version r20140717: parameters of –min_contig_length 100, –group_pairs_distance 400, and –SS_lib_type RF) to generate a UniGene set.2.5. Gene prediction and annotationTransfer RNA (tRNA) genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE26 (version 1.23) with the default parameters, whereas ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were predicted using BLASTN searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E - 10, with the Arabidopsis thaliana 18S rRNA (accession number: X16077) and 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (accession number: X52320) used as query sequences.To identify putative protein-encoding genes in PAV_r1.0, a MAKER pipeline27 (version 2.31.8) including ab-initio-, evidence-, and homology-based gene prediction methods was used. For this prediction, the UniGene set generated from the RNA-Seq analysis and peptide sequences predicted from the genomes of Rosaceae members (e.g. F. vesca [Genome Database for Rosaceae, GDR, version v2.0.a1],28,Pr. persica [GDR v2.0.a1]2, M. × domestica [GDR v1.0p],1 and Pr. mume5) were used as a training data set. In addition, BRAKER129 (version 1.3) was also used to complete the gene set for PAV_r1.0. Genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were detected using BLASTP searches against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database with an E-value cutoff of 1E - 10 and by using InterProScan30 (version 4.8) searches against the InterPro database31 with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. The putative genes of PAV_r1.0 were clustered using CD-hit32 (version 4.6.1) with the UniGene set of F. vesca (GDR v2.0.a1),28,Pr. persica (GDR v2.0.a1)2, M. × domestica (GDR v1.0p),1 and Pr. mume5 with the parameters c = 0.6 and aL = 0.4. The genes in the plant species described above were classified into plant gene ontology (GO) slim categories33 and euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) categories,34 and mapped onto the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) reference pathways.352.6. Construction of genetic linkage maps and comparative genomicsThree F1-mapping populations, shown in Supplementary Figure S1, were used to construct genetic linkage maps: (1) C-303 (n = 94), derived from a cross between Beniyutaka and Benikirari; (2) C-309 (n = 84), derived from a cross between C-195-50, which is a hybrid of Benishuho and an F1 C-47-70 of Benisayaka × Rainer, and Benikirari; and (3) HRO (n = 384), derived from a cross between Nanyo and Benisayaka. Genomic DNA extracted from the leaves of each line was subjected to double-digest restriction site–associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-Seq) library construction.36 The DNA was digested using two restriction enzymes, PstI and EcoRI, and DNA fragments of 300–900 bp in length were fractionated using BluePippin (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq (Illumina) in PE 93 bp mode.Primary data processing of the sequencing reads was performed as described by Shirasawa et al.36 with minor modifications. Low-quality sequences were removed and adapters were trimmed using PRINSEQ16 (version 0.20.4) and fastx_clipper in the FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13: http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit (8 May 2017, date last accessed)), respectively. The filtered reads were mapped onto the PAV_r1.0 reference sequence using Bowtie 237 (version 2.2.3). To obtain a variant call format (VCF) file including SNP information, the sequence alignment/map format (SAM) files were converted to binary sequence alignment/map format (BAM) files and subjected to SNP calling using the mpileup command of SAMtools38 (version 0.1.19) and the view command of BCFtools.38 Missing data were imputed using Beagle439 (version r1185). High-confidence SNPs were selected using VCFtools40 (version 0.1.12b) with the following criteria: 1) =5× coverage in each plant line (–minDP 5), 2) >10 SNP quality value (–minQ 10), 3) =0.2 minor allele frequency (–maf 0.2), and 4) <0.5 missing data rate (–max-missing 0.5).In addition, SSR markers reported in the previous studies41–56 (Supplementary Table S1) were also employed. The polymorphism screening and genotyping were performed with an Applied Biosystems 3500 Series Genetic Analyzer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The segregated SNP and SSR data of the mapping population were prepared for the CP mode of JoinMap57 (version 4) and classified into groups using the Grouping Module of JoinMap with LOD scores of 4 to 7. The marker order and relative map distances were calculated using its regression-mapping algorithm with the following parameters: Haldane’s mapping function, =0.35 recombination frequency, and =2.0 LOD score. LPmerge58 (version 1.5) was used to integrate the linkage maps into the consensus map. The graphical linkage maps were drawn using MapChart59 (version 2.2).For comparing the genome of sweet cherry with those of its relatives, similarity searches between the SNP-associated sequences of PAV_r1.0 (201 bp in length) and the pseudomolecule sequences of Pr. persica (GDR v2.0.a1),2,P. mume,5,F. vesca (GDR v2.0.a1),28 and P. bretschneideri3 were carried out using BLASTN searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E–15. The graphical comparative maps were drawn using Circos60 (version 0.69-3).2.7. Pseudomolecule constructionTwo approaches, based on the genetic map and synteny between the genomes of sweet cherry and peach, were used to construct pseudomolecule sequences. First, the genome scaffolds were assigned to the genetic map. If more than two marker loci were mapped on a single scaffold, the scaffolds were assigned with the orientation based on the marker order. Next, sequence similarity analysis of peptide sequences predicted from PAV_r1.0 was performed against those of the peach genome using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1E–5. Scaffolds having a linear relationship (R2 > 0.6) with at least five continuous genes between the two genomes were assigned to a chromosome with that orientation. The resulting pseudomolecule sequences were aligned to the peach genome, GDR v2.0.a1, with NUCmer of the MUMmer package61 (version 2.23).2.8. Whole-genome resequencing for identification of DNA polymorphismSequence reads from the PE sequencing of six varieties, Benikirari, Benisayaka, Benishuho, Benitemari, Beniyutaka, and Nanyo, were trimmed and filtered as above, and mapped on the PAV_r1.0 reference sequence with Bowtie 237 (version 2.2.3: parameters of –minins 100, –no-mixed, and -k 2). The resulting BAM files were subjected to SNP calling with the mpileup command of SAMtools38 (version 0.1.19: parameter of -Duf) and the view command of BCFtools38 (parameter of -vcg), and filtered with VCFtools40 (version 0.1.12b: parameters of –minQ 50, –minGQ 20, –minDP 10, and –maxDP 100). The effects of mutations on gene function were predicted with SnpEff62 (version 4.2: parameters of -no-downstream and -no-upstream). SnpEff predicted the sequence ontology63 of the mutations and assigned them to four predefined impact categories: high- (e.g. nonsense mutations and frameshift mutations), moderate- (e.g. missense mutations), modifier- (e.g. intron and intergenic mutations) and low-impact (e.g. synonymous mutations) (see http://snpeff.sourceforge.net (8 May 2017, date last accessed) for details).Copy number variations (CNVs) were detected with CNV-seq64 (version 0.2.7: parameter of –genome-size 272361615) using the BAM files, in which the six varieties were used as test lines with PAV_r1.0 as a reference.2.9. Development of CAPS, indel, and SSR markersSNP2CAPS65 was used for developing cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers with 19 restriction enzymes: AfaI, AluI, ApaI, BamHI, BglII, DraI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HaeIII, HhaI, HindIII, KpnI, MboI, MspI, PstI, SacI, SalI, XbaI, and XhoI. SSRs were identified using the mismatched variable penalty (mmvp) mode of SciRoKoCo66 to detect imperfect microsatellites. Indels were selected from the VCF file of the resequencing analysis with VCFtools40 (version 0.1.12b: parameter of –keep-only-indels). Oligonucleotides for the markers were designed using PRIMER367 (version 2.2.3).3. Results3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the sweet cherry genomeA total of 357.5 million high-quality reads (32.9 Gb) were obtained from the Satonishiki cherry PE library, which had an insert size of 500 bp (Supplementary Table S2). The distribution of distinct k-mers (k = 17) showed two peaks at multiplicities of 41 and 77 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The low and high peaks represent heterozygous and homozygous sequences, respectively, suggesting that the heterogeneity of the genome was low. We estimated the genome size to be 352.9 Mb from the higher peak, which almost agreed with the value measured by flow cytometry, 338 Mb.68The 357.5 million PE reads were assembled into contigs using SOAPdenovo2 with five k-mer sizes (51, 61, 71, 81, and 91), and the obtained contigs were assembled into scaffolds with 121.3 million MP reads (Supplementary Table S2). When a k-mer size of 81 was employed, the total length of the scaffolds (373.7 Mb) was close to the estimated genome size and the N50 length (114.8 kb) was the longest. In parallel, we investigated another assembling tool, Platanus. However, while the N50 length (462.8 kb) was longer than that from SOAPdenovo2, the total length of the assembly (273.2 Mb) was ~100 Mb shorter than expected. Therefore, we used the assembled sequences from SOAPdenovo2 (k-mer = 81) in further analyses. Gap sequences of 47.7 million bases, represented by Ns, were filled using the PE reads. After removing sequences from contaminating sources (1.6 Mb from organelles, bacteria, fungi, and humans) and sequences that were shorter than 1,000 bases (97.0 Mb) (see also the next section), the remaining 10,148 sequences were designated PAV_r1.0 (Table 1), which was 272.4 Mb with an N50 length of 219.6 kb (Supplementary Table S3). The GC content was 37.7%, and the length of ambiguous bases (Ns) was 25.6 Mb. The genomic completeness of PAV_r1.0 examined with BUSCO revealed that PAV_r1.0 had 918 (96.0%) complete orthologues and 17 (1.8%) fragmented orthologues, indicating that PAV_r1.0 had good coverage of the gene space of the sweet cherry genome (Supplementary Table S4).3.2. Repetitive sequence analysisIn PAV_r1.0 (273.2 Mb), 119.4 Mb (43.8%) of repetitive sequence was identified (e.g. transposons and retrotransposons), consisting of 34.3 Mb of reported repetitive sequences and 85.1 Mb of repeats unique to PAV_r1.0 (Supplementary Table S5). The reported sequences were predominantly LTR retrotransposons: Copia and Gypsy elements occupying 8.4 and 8.0 Mb, respectively. On the other hand, repeats occupied 84.2% of the eliminated sequences, each of which was <1,000 bp in length, suggesting that this repeat richness might collapse long assemblies.3.3. Gene predictions and functional annotationsWe found 536 tRNA- and 61 rRNA-encoding genes in PAV_r1.0 (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Subsequently, we predicted protein-encoding sequences in PAV_r1.0 using evidence-, ab-initio-, and homology-based methods in a MAKER pipeline. In the evidence-based method, we used 189,538 transcribed sequences (Supplementary Table S8) obtained from the assembly of 57.6 million transcript reads from eight samples (Supplementary Table S9) to predict 23,709 genes (with .mk suffix), excluding TE-like sequences. Moreover, an additional 19,964 non-TE genes, which did not overlap the 23,709 genes, were predicted using the ab-initio method (with .br suffix). In total, 43,349 genes plus 324 pseudogenes were predicted to be in PAV_r1.0 (Supplementary Table S10). The GC content of the coding sequences was 44.3%, and the N50 length was 1,707 bases (Supplementary Table S10).The 43,349 genes were further annotated using GO, KOG, and KEGG. In the GO analysis, 9,256 (21.4%), 3,610 (8.3%), and 14,582 (33.6%) genes were assigned to the GO slim terms of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, respectively, (Supplementary Table S11). In the KOG analysis, 2,829, 4,690, and 4,078 genes had significant similarity to genes involved in information storage and processing, cellular processing and signaling, and metabolism (Supplementary Table S12). Furthermore, 1,672 genes were mapped to KEGG metabolic pathways (Supplementary Table S13).For comparing the genes predicted in PAV_r1.0 with those of other Rosaceae species, the 43,349 genes were clustered with the genes of peach, Japanese apricot, apple, and strawberry to generate 75,627 clusters. A total of 3,459 clusters, including 4,535 genes from sweet cherry, were observed in all investigated species (Supplementary Fig. S3). On the other hand, whereas 869 clusters were absent from only sweet cherry, 16,151 clusters, consisting of 21,642 genes, were specific to sweet cherry. The proportion of ab initio genes in the sweet cherry specific clusters, which annotation edit distance (AED)69 was 0.28 on average, was 68.4%, while that in other clusters (AED score of 0.16) was 22.3%.3.4. Construction of the consensus genetic map and comparative mapTo anchor the genomic sequences to the sweet cherry chromosomes, high-density genetic maps for three F1 populations, C-303, C-309, and HRO, were developed using ddRAD-Seq. Approximately 1.2 million, 1.9 million, and 1.4 million high-quality reads were obtained from ddRAD-Seq libraries for C-303, C-309, and HRO, respectively, and 90.6% of the reads across the three populations aligned to PAV_r1.0; these were used to detect SNP candidates (Supplementary Table S14). After filtering out low-quality candidates, 1,384, 1,475, and 1,157 high-quality SNPs were selected for C-303, C-309, and HRO, respectively. Subsequent linkage analysis, together with 53 and 37 SSRs for C-303 and C-309, respectively, generated eight linkage groups for the parental lines of each population, except for Beniyutaka of C-303 (Supplementary Tables S15 and S16). The six linkage maps were integrated into a consensus linkage map consisting of 2,317 SNPs and 65 SSRs, covering a total of 1,165 cM (Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplementary Tables S15 and S16).Using the consensus map, the genomic structure of sweet cherry was compared with those of peach (Pr. persica), Japanese apricot (Pr. mume), strawberry (F. vesca), and Chinese pear (Py. bretschneideri). Out of the 2,317 mapped SNP loci, the flanking sequences had significant similarity to 2,280 loci in the peach genome, followed by 2,194 in Japanese apricot, 847 in Chinese pear, and 556 in strawberry. The sweet cherry linkage groups were therefore numbered in accordance with the names of peach chromosomes, because there was a one-to-one correspondence between the two genomes (Supplementary Fig. S5).3.5. Establishment of the pseudomoleculesPseudomolecules for sweet cherry were established using map- and synteny-based strategies. In the map-based strategy, 162 genomic sequences spanning 14.5 Mb were aligned and ordered on the consensus map using the positions of the 2,280 SNPs as anchors. Furthermore, using the synteny-based strategy, 743 sequences (177.3 Mb) were mapped on the peach genome, with the criterion that peptide sequences of =5 continuous genes from a scaffold sequence significantly matched those in the peach genome in the same order. In total, 905 scaffolds, spanning 191.7 Mb (70.4% of the length of PAV_r1.0) and carrying 31,452 genes (72.0% of the predicted genes), were anchored to the sweet cherry chromosomes (Table 2). The scaffold sequences were concatenated with 10,000 Ns into pseudomolecule sequences (Supplementary Table S17). As expected, the pseudomolecules evenly covered 60.2% of the peach genome (Fig. 1).

Sequence similarity is indicated by colors.3.6. Genetic diversity analysisTo investigate sequence and structural variation in the sweet cherry genome, whole-genome resequencing was performed on six varieties belonging to a single pedigree (Supplementary Fig. S1). We obtained 28.1× coverage with high-quality sequence read data (9.9 Gb) for each plant line, and 91.6% of the reads were mapped onto the pseudomolecule sequences (Supplementary Table S18).A total of 1,179,268 sequence variants, consisting of 1,016,866 SNPs and 162,402 insertions/deletions (up to 15 bp differences), were discovered. The densities of SNPs and indels in the genome were estimated to be 412.0 and 65.8 per 100 kb, respectively. Among the SNPs, the major and minor substitutions were G/C to A/T transversions (31.2%) and G/C to C/G transversions (6.0%), respectively, and the transitions/transversions ratio was 1.5 across the six varieties. Differing numbers of sequence variants with respect to PAV_r1.0 were observed, ranging from 527,049 in Benishuho to 640,683 in Benitemari (Supplementary Table S19). The density of the variants in each variety was calculated to be 245.7 variants per 100 kb on average. The number of heterozygous loci was 463,240.5 on average, ranging from 405,911 in Benikirari to 528,752 in Benitemari. Particularly, chromosomes 5 and 7 of Beniyutaka had fewer heterozygous loci.The SNPs and indels were functionally annotated and classified into four categories: modifiers (88.2%) and moderate- (6.4%), low- (4.6%), and high- (0.7%) impact mutations (Supplementary Table S20). The most prevalent were variants in intergenic regions (modifiers, 65.8%) followed by intron variants (modifiers, 19.2%), missense variants (moderate-impact, 6.1%), and synonymous variants (low-impact, 3.9%). In the high-impact category, frameshift (0.3%) and stop-gained variants (0.2%) dominated.In addition, CNV candidates were detected over the genomes of the six lines (Supplementary Fig. S6). The average length of CNVs was 2.5 kb and the longest was approximately 32 kb in chromosome 7 of Beniyutaka, which included eight predicted genes (Pav_sc0000496.1_g220.1.br to Pav_sc0000496.1_g310.1.br). Numbers of the CNVs were ranging from 3,341 in Benishuho to 9,074 in Benikirari.3.7. DNA marker developmentCAPS and indel markers were developed in accordance with the sequence variants identified from whole-genome resequencing. Out of the 1,016,866 SNPs, 131,679 (12.9%) were located in the recognition sequence of 19 restriction enzymes. We also designed a total of 143,223 CAPS markers (Supplementary Table S21). In parallel, 151,468 indel markers for which primers were available were developed from the 162,402 indels (Supplementary Table S22). A total of 85,731 SSR motifs were detected in PAV_r1.0, including 40,924 (47.7%) di-, 13,473 (15.7%) tri-, 10,340 (12.1%) tetra-, 13,077 (15.3%) penta-, and 7,917 (9.2%) hexa-nucleotide repeat units. The most prevalent sequences in each repeat unit were AG (25,003), AAG (3,919), AAAT (5,551), AAAAT (4,056), and AAAAAT (1,497). We found that 29,539 SSRs (34.5%) were in gene regions and the remaining 56,192 (65.5%) were in intergenic regions. Out of the SSRs, primer pairs were successfully designed for 82,852 SSR motifs (96.6%), which were registered as SSR markers (Supplementary Table S23).3.8. Agronomically important genes in the sweet cherry genomeWe compared six agronomically important genes in peach70 with the predicted coding sequences. We found that two genes, Pav_sc0000464.1_g250.1.br and Pav_sc0000493.1_g020.1.br, were putative orthologues for ppa016711m (peach skin color) and ppa027093m (peach flesh color), respectively. In addition, Pav_sc0000103.1_g380.1.mk and Pav_sc0001587.1_g070.1.mk were orthologues of ppa010316m and ppa003772m, which associate with fruit hairiness and shape, respectively. Furthermore, Pav_sc0000024.1_g440.1.mk and Pav_sc0000600.1_g890.1.mk might correspond to ppa003772m (fruit adhesion and texture) and ppa006339m (non-acid fruit).Self-incompatibility in sweet cherry is controlled by the S-locus, which carries the genes for S-RNase and S-locus F-box protein (SFB) as female and male determinants, respectively. Satonishiki possesses the S3 and S6 haplotypes. As expected, S-RNase (Pav_sc0004475.1_g130.1.mk) and SFB (Pav_sc0004475.1_g100.1.mk) of the S3 haplotype were identified in a single contig sequence, Pav_sc0004475.1, and those of S6 (S-RNase: Pav_sc0006359.1_g040.1.mk; and SFB: Pav_sc0006359.1_g030.1.mk) were found in another contig, Pav_sc0006359.1. The physical distances between S-RNase and SFB were 7.4 kb and 1.5 kb in the S3 and S6 haplotypes, respectively. Neither the orientation nor the order of the genes predicted in the contigs was conserved, suggesting that the genomic structures of the S-loci were divergent. Subsequently, we investigated the depth of coverage of the resequencing across the six lines (Fig. 2). The reads were evenly mapped across the contigs when the lines had an identical S-haplotype to Satonishiki. Otherwise, the coverage was partial, suggesting that the genome sequences were divergent across different S-haplotypes (e.g. S1, S4, and S4’) as well as S3 and S6.

DiscussionHere, we report the first draft genome sequence of sweet cherry. The sequence data were used to establish genetic linkage maps with ddRAD-Seq technology, to enable whole-genome resequencing analysis to reveal the genetic diversity of cultivated lines, and to develop genome-wide DNA markers including SNPs, indels, and SSRs. In addition, agronomically important genes were identified by comparative analysis with Rosaceae relatives. This information will further genetic and genomic studies as well as assist in sweet cherry breeding programs.The size of the assembled genome, PAV_r1.0, was 272.4 Mb, which covered 77.8% of the estimated genome size of ~350 Mb (Table 1). The remaining 97 Mb of sequence was eliminated from the final assembly due to short contigs (<1,000 bp) enriched in repetitive sequences. The genome sizes of other diploid species in Rosaceae are estimated to be 265 Mb in peach,2 280 Mb in Japanese apricot,5 and 240 Mb in strawberry,6 all of which are approximately 100 Mb shorter than that of sweet cherry. On the other hand, the proportion of repetitive sequences in PAV_r1.0 was almost equal to that of Pr. persica, Pr. mume, and F. vesca: approximately 40%. Therefore, we considered that a subset of the sweet cherry genome, PAV_r1.0, might correspond to the genomes of Pr. persica, Pr. mume, and F. vesca. Indeed, PAV_r1.0 included >96% of BUSCO genes (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting that PAV_r1.0 sufficiently covered the gene space of the sweet cherry genome. The repeat-rich 97 Mb of sequences eliminated from the assembly might cause genome expansion in sweet cherry, making it larger than the other diploid species. Assembly statistics of the sweet cherry genomeAssembly statistics of the sweet cherry genomeStatistics of the pseudomolecules for the sweet cherry genomeaPercentage of PAV_r1.0.Statistics of the pseudomolecules for the sweet cherry genomeaPercentage of PAV_r1.0.Comparative analysis of the consensus genetic map (Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplementary Table S16) found high chromosome-level synteny between sweet cherry and peach (Supplementary Fig. S5), supporting the results of previous studies.9 Therefore, it would be possible to apply genetic knowledge from peach to sweet cherry, as proposed by Dirlewanger et al.10 As shown above, orthologues of agronomically important genes identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in peach70 were nominated in sweet cherry using sequence similarity. In addition, in silico mapping of QTLs and genes, which have been curated and summarized in GDR47 (http://www.rosaceae.org (8 May 2017, date last accessed)) and PGDBj71 (http://pgdbj.jp (8 May 2017, date last accessed)), among other databases, could identify useful gene candidates for sweet cherry breeding programs. Moreover, it might be possible to identify attractive genes from the sweet cherry specific cluster (Supplementary Fig. S3), even though most of genes had no informative functional annotations due to ab initio prediction. Whole-genome resequencing is one of the most effective methods for allele mining. In the future, genotype and sequence variation could be assigned to phenotypic variation using QTL studies and GWAS.In general, whole-genome resequencing of wide-spread cultivated lines and their founders would reveal historical domestication and breeding processes. However, in this study, we targeted six cultivated lines, all of which were bred in Yamagata, Japan, and registered within 40 years. It would be difficult to obtain evidence of historical events, but it is possible to gain insight into new breeding strategies. Because breeding programs for sweet cherry, as well as other fruiting trees, require time and space, it is difficult to perform high-throughput breeding. Therefore, genomics-assisted breeding72 and new plant-breeding techniques73 are more effective approaches. For example, in pear, genome-wide information about SNPs and phenotypes enables the prediction of trait segregation in a progeny population, which assists in choosing a good parental combination.74 Moreover, in apple, accelerating generation advancement has been accomplished through a plant virus vector that carries a promoter for Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T and a silencer for apple TERMINAL FLOWER 1.75 These technologies developed in Rosaceae, together with a genomic selection strategy,72 would make it possible to quickly produce excellent lines, whose phenotypes (e.g. fruit size, taste, and shelf-life) would exceed those of the current leading varieties. The genomic information obtained from this study would accelerate genetic analysis and breeding programs in sweet cherry as well as other fruiting trees.5.

IntroductionIn higher plants, DNA can be methylated at cytosine bases in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG and GHH, where H is A, C or T). Cytosine methylation is regulated by a diversity of known factors, including DNA methyltransferases (MET1, CMTs and DRMs),1 demethylases (DME, ROS1, DML2 and DML3)2 and the chromatin-remodelling factor DDM1.3 Proper regulation of cytosine methylation is essential for silencing transposable elements (TEs), moderating appropriate gene expression and maintaining proper chromatin structure. Much of our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in plant processes derives from experiments utilizing 5-azacytidine (5azaC), a chemical analogue of cytidine that inhibits DNA methyltransferases and reduces genomic methylation levels by direct incorporation into DNA and substitutions for cytosine. For example, 5azaC treatment accelerated the flowering process in the long-day plant Silene armeria and the short-day plant Perilla frutescens under non-inductive photoperiodic conditions.4 Treatment of tomato fruit could accelerate the ripening process by enhancing the transcriptional abundances of the hallmark ripening genes pg2a (encoding the pectinase polygalacturonase) and psy1 (phytoene synthase). Further methylome analysis of the tomato fruit ripening process revealed that DNA methylation triggered the fruit ripening process and regulated the quality of fruit formation, such as the cell wall, colour and aroma.5 Moreover, the involvements of DNA methylation regulating secondary metabolism has also been described in the plant kingdom. For example, in apple and pear, DNA methylation acts as a regulator at the MYB promoter region to determinate peel colour via different levels of anthocyanin accumulation.6,7 Similarly, different DNA methylation status effects on the chalcone synthase gene determine the anthocyanin pigmentation in the floral tissues of two Oncidium orchid cultivars.8 In Vitis amurensis, 5azaC treatment of the rolB-transgenic callus, which accumulates higher resveratrol contents, further increased the resveratrol production, indicating that DNA methylation could also influence the secondary metabolism.9Carotenoids are a diverse group of natural products that are widely distributed throughout plants, algae, fungi and bacteria.10 Carotenoids not only comprise colourful pigments in flowers and fruits but they also play important roles in photosynthesis, antenna assembly and photoprotection.11 The precursor of carotenoid biosynthesis is geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which is synthesized via the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (MEP) pathway.12,13 Two molecules of GGPPs are synthesized by phytoene synthase (PSY) to generate phytoene. This procedure is widely accepted as a rate-limiting step in the carotenoid pathway.14 Four additional enzymes act to convert phytoene to all trans-lycopene: phytoene desaturase (PDS), <U+03B6>-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO), <U+03B6>-carotene desaturase (ZDS), and carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO).15,16 The synergistic actions of lycopene ß-cyclase (LCYB) and lycopene e-cyclase (LCYE) then determine the lycopene flux that produces lutein, ß-carotene, and the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids. Carotenoids can be enzymatically cleaved to produce apocarotenoids, which are commonly known as abscisic acid (ABA), strigolactones and volatile compounds 17. Two types of carotenoid cleavage enzymes have been identified in plants: 9-cis carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (NCEDs), which catalyze the first step in ABA biosynthesis, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), which cleave double bonds at different positions in various carotenoid substrates, giving rise to volatile and non-volatile apocarotenoids.18 CCD1 cloned from maize, rice, Rosa damascene and other plants can cleave a variety of carotenoid substrates in vitro, indicating that the cleavage positions of CCD1 are not regioselective.19–21 In citrus, CitCCD1 has been reported to cleave at the 9–10 and 9'–10' positions of ß-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and all-trans-violaxanthin and at the 9'–10' position of 9-cis-violaxanthin.22,23 However, another member of the CCD family in citrus, CitCCD4, has shown cleaving specificity for the 7–8 or 7'–8' positions of ß-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, leading to the formation of ß-citraurin.24Citrus fruits accumulate an abundance of carotenoids and present various colours with different carotenoid accumulation patterns. To understand the basis of carotenoid biosynthesis, we expressed the phytoene synthase gene CrtB from Erwinia herbicola in citrus callus in vitro, resulting in an accumulation of high levels of carotenoids.25,26 To explore the possible involvement of DNA methylation in carotenoid metabolism, we treated the CrtB-transgenic callus (named M33) with incremental concentrations of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5azaC. The 5azaC treatments triggered carotenoid degradation and thus decreased carotenoid contents. Furthermore, analysis of the methylome and transcriptome patterns was performed to identify the global changes in DNA methylation associated with 5azaC treatment. The results revealed that a diverse set of genes was demethylated, including genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), and 5azaC treatment led to the up-regulation of a wide range of TEs. These data provide insight into whole-genome changes in biological processes in response to 5azaC (demethylation) treatment and improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying DNA methylation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe wild-type callus was propagated by abortive ovule embryogenic calli derived from Pink Marsh grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) and, designated as WT. The CrtB (CrtB, a bacterial phytoene synthase gene, GenBank No. M90698) transgenic callus line M33 used in this study was established by transformation of the suspended grapefruit callus (WT) with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 containing the PMV vector with the chimeric gene (tp-rbcS-CrtB) as described previously.25 The previous study showed that the total carotenoid content was markedly increased in CrtB-transgenic callus M33 compared with the non-coloured WT callus. The specimens of WT and M33 were preserved and supplied by the Key Laboratory of Horticultural Plant Biology of Ministry of Education at Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), Wuhan, China.2.2. 5azaC treatmentsThe 5azaC reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile double-distilled water at 40 mM, and the solution was filtered with a sterile 0.22-µm filters. After filtration, the sterile 5azaC solution was added to liquid MT to the designated concentrations. The 3 g of input grapefruit callus was added to liquid MT medium with the designated 5azaC concentrations of 0 µM (control), 10, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 400 µM with shaking (130 rpm) for 15 days. Then, the 400 µM-treated callus was cultured on normal solid MT medium for one month and transferred to liquid MT medium with shaking (130 rpm) for 15 days to maintain similar culture conditions. After treatment, the callus was harvested as the TR line.2.3. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) analysisThe genomic DNAs of CK, 400 and TR callus were used for global methylation analysis. Each sample consisted of two biological replicates for independent library construction and sequencing. The genomic DNA was sheared with Bioruptor UCD 200 (Diagenode) to 100–500 bp. The library constructions of shared DNA were performed with the DNA-seq Library Preparation Kit-Illumina Compatible (Gnomegen K02422). The Methylated-DNA IP Kit (ZYMO D5101) was applied to the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation. The library products were sequencing using an Illumina HiSeqTM 2500. After filtration, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome27 using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) software. Peak-calling was performed with MACS 1.4.0 software.28 The differentially methylated peaks were analyzed with the edgeR package. The significant differently methylated peaks were located near different elements according to the reference genome annotation.272.4. RNA-seq and global detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)The RNAs extracted from M33 control callus (CK), 400 µM 5azaC treated callus (400) and treatment recovery callus (TR) were applied to DEG analysis. Each sample had three biological replicates for independent library construction and sequencing. The library products were sequencing by Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. After the filtration, clean reads were mapped to reference genome27 using SOAPaligner/SOAP2.29 The gene expression level was calculated by using RPKM method (Reads Per kb per Million reads). We used ‘FDR (False Discovery Rate) = 0.001 and the absolute value of log2Ratio = 1’ as the threshold to judge the significance of gene expression difference. After getting Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for DEGs, WEGO software30 was applied to analyze the GO functional classification for DEGs. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG) was applied to identify significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in DEGs comparing with the whole genome background.2.5. Carotenoid profile analysisAbout 0.3 g of lyophilized callus sample was applied to extract the total carotenoids and each sample extracted three independent replications. The absorbance of total carotenoids content was analyzed by a Microplate spectrophotometer (TECAN, infinite M200). The carotenoid extraction and analysis using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was applied as previously described.25,31 The analysis of carotenoid profile was performed on a Waters liquid chromatography system (600E solvent pump system, 2996 photodiode array detection, 717 plus autosampler). A C30 carotenoid column (150 × 4.6 mm; YMC, Japan) was used to elute the carotenoids. Each sample was performed with three independent replications and SPSS software was applied to statistical analysis (P <0.05 (*), P <0.01 (**)).2.6. Quantitative analysis of gene expressionTotal RNA was extracted from the callus according to the method described previously.32 First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2.0 µg of total RNA using the ReverAid first strand cDNA synthesis KIT (Fermentas). The real-time PCR primers used in this study were as listed in the previous study31 or designed by Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) based on the sequenced genome data.27 The primer sequences were listed in Supplementary Table S5. The primers were diluted in Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the amplification mixture volume was 10 µL per reaction. Reaction conditions were an initial incubation for 2 min at 50 °C and 95 °C for 1min, and then followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C/15 s and 60 °C/1 min. Reactions were run on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System with 384-Well Block Module (Applied Biosystems). The ß-actin gene was used as an endogenous control and comparative Ct method (2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct) was adopted to calculate the expression data according to the previous study.31 SPSS software was applied to the statistical analysis (P <0.01 (**)).2.7. Cloning of CpCCD1 and expression of CpCCD1 in carotenoid accumulating EscherichiacoliThe Gateway Cloning system was applied to the vector construction for the CpCCD1 bacterial expression analysis. The whole CDS sequence of citrus CCD1 (genome ID: Cs7g01710) was amplified by the primer pairs with the attB adapter (Forward: 5'-AAAAAGCAGGCT TC ATGGTGGAGAAAGAAAAGC-3'; Reverse: AGAAAGCTGGGT G TCACAATTTTGCTTGCTCT). The amplified fragment was used as the template to perform the second round PCR reaction with the attB-adapter primers (attB1-adapter: GGGGACA AGT TTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT; attB2-adapter: GGGGAC CACTTTGTACAAGAA AGCTGGGT). Then, the PCR product was cloned to the entry vector pDONR221 (Kanamycin) by performing the BP reaction and sequenced. After confirming the CpCCD1 sequence, the CpCCD1 was cloned to the final expression vector pDEST-17 (Ampicillin) by LR reaction. E. coli transformants harbouring plasmids pACCRT-EIB, pACCAR16<U+25B3>crtX and pACCAR25<U+25B3>crtX33 which accumulated lycopene, ß-carotene and zeaxanthin, respectively, with CpCCD1-pDEST-17 were transformed to E. coli (BL21). The culture conditions and carotenoid analysis were according to the previous study.342.8. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of CpCCD1 geneThe genomic DNA was extracted as Cheng et al. 35 and treated with the ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (D5005). The converted gDNA was amplified with specific primers of three selected regions (M1, M2 and M3) which located in promoter and first exon of the CpCCD1. The locations of these three primer pairs were as follows: M1 (from -1689 to -1286) Forward: TTGAAGTTGGGGGAAATGTTAAAGG, Reverse: CAAAATTTARTTACACTAACCTCT; M2 (from -636 to -140) Forward: TAGATTTTGTGAGAATTATTTGAGG, Reverse: TCCTTTACRACCCACARCAAAA; M3: (+105 to +589) Forward: TGTGGAGAAAYTGATAGTGAAGTGG, Reverse: CCACAATCTCTRTACATAACTCTCT. The positive clone sequences combined with the untreated sequences were analyzed by CyMATE tool (http://www.cymate.org/).362.9. Measurement of ABA contentAbout 0.2 mg callus of each sample was applied to hormone extractions.37 Each sample was preformed with four replications with independent extraction. 10 ng of [2H6]ABA (2-cis, 4-trans-abscisic acid-[2H6], olchemim, Czech Republic) was used as internal standards for ABA detection. The hormone extractions were separated by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography; Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and measured with HPLC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (API3000 mass spectrometer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The MS/MS conditions were set according to Pan et al.373. Results3.1. Citrus methylome patterns and their variations in response to 5azaC treatmentThe responses of wild-type (WT) and CrtB-transgenic (M33 line) calli to various concentrations of 5azaC (control-CK, 0 µM; 10, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 400 µM) and the treatment recovery (TR) line were investigated (Fig. 1). To evaluate global DNA methylation distributions and variations in response to 5azaC treatment, CK, 400 and TR callus lines were analyzed using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) (red box in Fig. 1). For each sample, two biological replicates were applied for library construction and sequencing. Methylation status of samples including CK, 400 and TR, gene and TE density were displayed in Fig. 2A. The results showed that TEs presented a hypermethylation status and were mainly concentrated in pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. In contrast, methylation in gene-rich regions were characterized by hypomethylation and mainly concentrated in euchromatic regions. Moreover, the distributions of DNA methylation level in genes and TEs were shown in Fig. 2B. We found that gene body (middle region) presented a low methylation level and the up-stream and down-stream regions of gene body showed a relatively higher methylation level. In contrast, TEs showed a higher methylation level in TE body and lower methylation levels in up-stream and down-stream regions (Fig. 2B). Concerning the methylation changes in response to 5azaC, the methylation level of 400 callus was higher than it in CK and TR lines in gene body region, but lower in up-stream and down-stream regions, corresponding to the results that the demethylation effects caused by 5azaC were mainly occurred in intergenic areas (Fig. 3A). In TE and its flanking regions, the methylation level of 400 callus was consistently lower than CK and TR lines (Fig. 2B). Seven 5-azactytine (5azaC) concentration gradients were assessed: control (CK, 0 µM), 10, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 400 µM on citrus callus. The 400 µM 5azaC-treated callus (400) was cultured on normal MT medium for one month as the TR line.Seven 5-azactytine (5azaC) concentration gradients were assessed: control (CK, 0 µM), 10, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 400 µM on citrus callus.

(D) Distributions and functional categories of DMGs analyzed by MapMan.The distribution of regions showing changes in methylation in response to 5azaC is shown in Fig. 3A. The largest number of DNA methylation variations altered by 5azaC treatment occurred in intergenic areas. To investigate whether TE genes were activated by 5azaC, 3 TE genes with high methylation enrichment and 12 additional TE genes that were randomly selected from the genome were analyzed for changes in expression. The results showed that most TE genes were up-regulated following 5azaC treatment and re-silenced in the TR lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). As expected, most of the gene elements were hypomethylated (down) in response to 5azaC treatment (CK vs. 400) and hypermethylated (up) in the TR callus (400 vs. TR). Moreover, Fig. 3B shows that variations in the methylation of genes occurred most frequently in the promoter region. In total, 3082 (682 up; 2400 down), 3516 (2752 up; 764 down) and 2086 (1171 up; 915 down) differentially methylated genes (DMGs) (including the gene body and promoter regions) were identified among CK vs. 400, 400 vs. TR and CK vs. TR, respectively (Fig. 3C). Among CK vs. 400, 1821 (76%) of the down-regulated DMGs affected by 5azaC treatment were up-regulated in the TR callus, indicating that these genes were potentially demethylated by 5azaC treatment and recovered in the TR callus.The distributions and functional categories of all DMGs were visualized using MapMan software (Fig. 3D). DMGs affected by 5azaC treatment were mainly categorized as proteins (Proteolysis), RNA (especially TFs), signalling, stress, secondary metabolism and hormone metabolism. Most of the DMGs involved in these pathways were demethylated by 5azaC treatment, while the majority of DMGs among the 400 vs. TR exhibited hypermethylation in these pathways (Supplementary Figure S2A). In the secondary metabolism category in particular, the DMGs were mainly involved in the pathways of ‘Phenlypropanoids’, ‘Lignin and lignans’ and ‘Flavonoids’ and included several carotenoid genes such as PSY (phytoene synthase) (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Since the methylome data showed that the methylation status of TFs was disrupted by 5azaC treatment, DMGs annotated as TFs (e-value <1 e-10, identity >70%) were further identified and are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. One hundred and thirty-five TFs (18 up, 117 down; belonging to 39 families), 167 TFs (146 up, 21 down; 43 families) and 95 TFs (60 up, 35 down; 29 families) were identified among the DMGs from CK vs. 400, 400 vs. TR and CK vs. TR, respectively. Mainly, TF families that were disturbed by 5azaC treatment are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2C. Particularly, 11 bHLHs (14 bHLHs in total), 8 NACs (9), 7 ERFs (9), 8 WRKYs (8) and 8 MYBs (8) were hypomethylated in response to 5azaC treatment, while 18 bHLHs (21), 12 MYBs (13), 11 NACs (11), 7 C3Hs (9), 6 C2H2s (9), 5 ERFs (7) and 6 WRKYs (6) were hypermethylated in the TR callus.DNA methylation is involved in various biological processes by regulating gene expressions. To explore the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression on a genome-wide scale, genes were first classified into non-expressed (FPKM value < 0.1) and expressed genes (FPKM value > 0.1). Expressed genes were further rank-ordered based on degree of gene expression and divided into quintiles. The first quintile is the 20% of genes with the lowest expression level and the fifth group is the highest. Then, the methylation levels were calculated for each quintiles. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, the first quintile shows the highest methylation level in control callus (CK), which means that genes with low expression levels present hyper-methylation status in citrus genome. In 400 µM 5azaC-treated callus, methylation pattern shows the opposite way compared with CK, which the first quintile presents the lowest methylation level and the second quintile is the second lowest. These findings also suggested that the 5azaC treatment presented the biggest demethylation effect on the genes with low expression level.3.2. Transcriptome changes in response to 5azaC treatmentsThe gene expression of the citrus DNA methyltransferase genes CsMET1, CsCMT1 and CsDRM1; the DNA demethylase gene CsDME1; and the chromatin-remodeling gene CsDDM1, was investigated in response to 5azaC treatment.38 As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, CsMET1, CsCMT1 and CsDDM1 were significantly up-regulated following 5azaC treatment independently of the WT and CrtB-transgenic calli. Additionally, the demethylase gene CsDME1 was slightly induced in both WT and M33 calli. These findings suggested that the methylome pattern in the callus was dynamically altered by 5azaC treatment.To investigate global gene expression in response to 5azaC treatment, we utilized RNA-seq technology to explore the expression patterns of CK, 400 mM treatment and TR. The results showed that the global gene expression patterns were altered by 5azaC treatment and recovered in the TR callus (Fig. 4A). A summary of sequencing samples and results is shown in Table 1. A total of 3407 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between CK and 400, with 2074 up-regulated and 1333 down-regulated genes. A total of 792 genes were significantly up-regulated and 1592 genes were down-regulated in 400 vs. TR (Fig. 4A). Indeed, a large numbers of activated genes (1397) in response to 5azaC treatment were also identified in the TR down-regulated gene group (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S2). To validate the RNA-seq data, 15 randomly selected DEGs, including 8 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated genes, were analyzed by qRT-PCR. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, the fold change values obtained by qRT-PCR were strongly correlated with the RNA-seq data (R2=0.79), indicating that the RNA-seq data were reliable to reflect the expression patterns. These data suggest that global expression patterns are strongly altered by 5azaC treatment.

Those GOs showing a significant difference from the expected distribution were cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus of biological process, cell, cell part and organelle of cellular component and binding, and binding and catalytic activity of molecular function (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, assignments of DEGs in pathways were visualized using MapMan tools. Fig. 5B shows that many DEGs were involved in ‘Proteolysis’, ‘Signalling’, ‘Cell wall’ and ‘Secondary metabolites’. In particular, an abundance of genes involved in secondary metabolism were enriched in the ‘Phenlypropanoids’ and ‘Lignin and lignans’ categories. In the ‘Proteolysis’ category, the F-box and RING genes involved in proteasome displayed altered expression levels in response to 5azaC treatment, implying that 5azaC treatment modified the Proteolysis process and induced the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (Supplementary Fig. S6). The functions of genes involved in hormone signalling were also disrupted by 5azaC treatment (Fig. 5). In detail, most genes involved in auxin, brassinosteroid, ethylene and Jasmonic acid (JA) signalling were up-regulated, while ABA signalling-related genes were down-regulated, consistent with the observed decrease in ABA content (Fig. 8).

(B) The MapMan bin of DEGs involved in the stress response.Interestingly, many genes assigned to the ‘Peroxidases’ and ‘Redox state’ categories were up-regulated in response to 5azaC treatment, suggesting that this treatment induced the callus peroxidation process. We further verified the changes in expression of all differentially expressed peroxidase genes and peroxidase (POD) activity in response to 5azaC. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S7, the expression levels of 17 peroxidase genes were strongly induced in 5azaC-treated calli and restored in the TR lines. Accordingly, POD activity was enhanced by 5azaC and recovered in the TR callus. These results suggested that 5azaC induced callus stress reactions, which involved strong activation of POD genes and enzyme activities to reduce peroxide levels. Furthermore, DEGs were subjected to KEGG pathway analysis (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) to understand the biological functions of DEGs. Many DEGs were enriched in ‘metabolites pathways’, particularly in phenylalanine and phenylpropanoid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, sugar metabolism and others (Supplementary Table S3). Since genes involved in sugar metabolism were disrupted by 5azaC, GC-MS analysis of callus extraction was further performed to analyze the basic primary metabolites in callus (Supplementary Fig. S8). The results showed that the contents of most types of sugars were increased, while various types of acids were decreased in response to 5azaC treatment.As shown in Fig. 5, TFs were also activated by 5azaC (demethylation) treatment. To analyze the changes in expression of TFs under 5azaC treatment, DEGs were identified as TFs using BLASTP software (e-value <1 e-10, identity >70%) based on planttfdb database (http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.php). As a result, 231 TFs (belonging to 43 families), 153 TFs (37 families) and 57 TFs (23 families) were identified among the 3407, 2384 and 623 DEGs between CK and 400, 400 and TR and CK and TR, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). The transcriptional changes in the top 16 TF families are shown in Fig. 6A. In detail, 21 (81% of total 26 MYBs) MYBs, 24 WRKYs (100%; 24), 9 NACs (43%; 21), 11 ERFs (55%; 20) and 9 bHLHs (82%; 11) were activated by 5azaC treatment (CK vs. 400), while 17 MYBs (89%; 19), 18 WRKYs (100%; 18), 8 ERFs (67%; 12), 5 NACs (45%; 11) and 6 bHLHs (75%; 8) were down-regulated in 400 vs. TR (Supplementary Table S4). The heat map also shows that many TFs were activated in response to 5azaC treatment and restored in the TR callus (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, qRT-PCR was performed to verify the expression levels of selected TFs belonging to the MYB, WRKY, NAC and ERF families (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, all the WRKY members were activated by 5azaC treatment and re-silenced in the TR lines, indicating that the WRKY family played a role in the response to 5azaC treatment.

As shown in Supplementary Fig. S9, for CK vs. 400, the DMGs and DEGs shared 343 common genes. Among these genes, 187 of the hypo-methylated DMGs were up-regulated and 17 of hyper-methylated DMGs were down-regulated, counting that 59.5% (204 genes) of the total common genes methylation changes showed a negative correlation to their expression variations (Supplementary Fig. S9). Similarly, 286 genes were both identified in DMGs and DEGs among 400 vs. TR. Among these genes, 189 genes (66.1%), including 12 hypo-methylated/up-regulated genes and 177 hyper-methylated/down-regulated genes, were presented a negative correlation between methylation changes and expression variations (Supplementary Fig. S9). These findings revealed that gene expression alterations were not always correlated to the corresponding DNA methylation changes.3.3. Enhanced CpCCD1 expression contributes to carotenoid degradation in response to 5azaCThe carotenoids were degraded upon 5azaC-treatment in the CrtB-transgenic callus line. The 400 µM 5azaC-treated callus (400) was cultured on normal MT medium for one month as a treatment recovery line (TR) (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, the carotenoid pigmentation of the M33 callus gradually decreased with increasing 5azaC concentrations, and was re-established after 1 month of growth on normal MT medium in the TR lines. Indeed, the total carotenoid contents decreased with increasing 5azaC concentrations and were recovered in the TR lines (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, HPLC analysis demonstrated that the M33 callus mainly accumulated ß-carotene, lutein, and a-carotene, with these three carotenoids showing a 64%, 88% and 79% reduction in 400 µM 5azaC-treated callus, respectively (Fig. 7B). Accordingly, the ABA content also decreased in the 5azaC-treated callus (Fig. 8), indicating that carotenoid degradation resulted in lack of ABA biosynthesis. In WT callus, the total carotenoid contents were significantly reduced in WT callus under the 100, 200 and 400 µM 5azaC-treatments (Fig. 7A). However, the ABA contents increased with an increase in 5azaC concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S10), suggesting that the observed increase in ABA content was not caused by carotenoid metabolism.

The transcript levels of the control (CK) were used as the calibrator for expression analysis. ** indicates a significant differences at P <0.01.To assess the possibility that the reduced carotenoid concentration observed in the 5azaC-treated CrtB-transgenic callus resulted from enhanced carotenoid metabolism, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in isoprenoid and carotenoid metabolism (Fig. 8). First, we tested the expression level of exogenous gene CrtB, and the results showed that CrtB was up-regulated in response to 5azaC treatment. Additionally, 5azaC treatment resulted in a significant increase in expression of the endogenous gene DXR (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase) in the isoprenoid pathway. For carotenoid pathway genes, the crucial rate-controlling gene, PSY, presented an increasing expression level with the increase in 5azaC concentrations (Fig. 8), which correlated with the demethylation of PSY in response to 5azaC (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Additionally, PDS and LCYE (lycopene e-cyclase) were induced by 5azaC treatments. The most prominent change in expression related to 5azaC was the ~8–12-fold increase in the expression of CpCCD1 (Fig. 8). Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that the CCD family in citrus comprised eight members. However, the expression levels of these genes were not induced by 5azaC treatment (Supplementary Fig. S11). Given the important role of CCD1 in carotenoid metabolism and the prominent effect of 5azaC on CpCCD1 expression, we focused on this gene.We isolated a 1.6-Kb CDS sequence of CpCCD1 (GenBank KT183033) from citrus callus. This sequence would encode a 547-amino-acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 61.8 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis of CCD proteins showed that CpCCD1 clustered with other typical CCD1 proteins and with the highest similarities (87%, 77% and 80% identity) to grape (VvCCD1), maize (ZmCCD1) and Arabidopsis (AtCCD1) CCD1 proteins, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S12A and B). To confirm the carotenoid degradation ability of CpCCD1, we expressed the full-length CDS of CpCCD1 in E. coli strains harbouring plasmids pACCAR25<U+25B3>crtX, pACCAR16<U+25B3>crtX and pACCRT-EIB, which were engineered to accumulate zeaxanthin, ß-carotene and lycopene. All three carotenoid-accumulating E. coli strains showed a sharp reduction in carotenoid pigmentation when CpCCD1 was expressed (Fig. 9). HPLC analysis also indicated that CpCCD1 had a strong ability to degrade zeaxanthin, ß-carotene and lycopene (Fig. 9). Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced CpCCD1 expression is at least a strong contributor to the effect of 5azaC on CrtB-transgenic callus. Functional analysis of CpCCD1 protein. Escherichia coli strains engineered to accumulate zeaxanthin, ß-carotene and lycopene were cotransformed with the CpCCD1 expression vector. Further carotenoid analysis of Escherichia coli strains was performed using HPLC.Functional analysis of CpCCD1 protein. Escherichia coli strains engineered to accumulate zeaxanthin, ß-carotene and lycopene were cotransformed with the CpCCD1 expression vector. Further carotenoid analysis of Escherichia coli strains was performed using HPLC.To investigate whether CpCCD1 induction was due to the 5azaC-dependent change in methylation of the CpCCD1 gene, we performed bisulfite-sequencing analysis targeting three representative regions (M1, M2 and M3) located in CpCCD1. M1 and M2 were located in promoter regions and M3 was in the first exon. As shown in Fig. 10, the M1 region was hypomethylated (~10%) in CrtB-transgenic callus. Oddly, the percentage of methylation level in 5azaC-treated callus increased to ~23–45%, indicating that M1 region was hypermethylated in response to 5azaC (Fig. 10). This finding suggested that although the 5azaC treatment induced extensive demethylation processes in treated callus, methylation statuses were also increased at some loci. Further methylome analysis confirmed this conclusion (Fig. 3). However, the M2 and M3 regions located near the start site were barely methylated (Supplementary Fig. S13), possibly to assure the initiation of transcription. Clearly, the M1, M2 and M3 regions of CpCCD1 were not demethylated by the 5azaC effect. This finding suggests the occurrence of either mechanisms other than DNA methylation of CpCCD1 induce CpCCD1 expression, or that regulatory changes in methylation occurred outside of the tested region.

DiscussionThe ongoing development of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides the possibility of exploring the DNA methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale. MeDIP-seq is a powerful technology and is widely applied in plant DNA methylome analyses.39–41 To our knowledge, this study presents the first global DNA methylation analysis in citrus species based on high-throughput sequencing. The 5azaC, which is known to block DNA methylation, has been widely used in DNA methylation studies. For example, 5azaC-treated Arabidopsis seedlings display an altered gene expression profile and up-regulated expression levels of many TEs.42 Moreover, in tomato, 5azaC treatment on the tomato fruit activated PSY expression and triggered the tomato fruit ripening process.5,Vitis amurensis cultured cells treated with 5azaC showed activation of the resveratrol biosynthesis gene STS (stilbene synthase) and increased resveratrol biosynthesis.9 Here, we used MeDIP-seq to characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in citrus and combined the methyltransferase inhibitor 5azaC to explore the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in the biological processes. The results revealed an overall demethylation effect across the whole genome, which was accompanied by TE activation (Supplementary Fig. S2). These data will provide a basis for understanding the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in various biological processes in citrus species.DNA methylation has generally been considered to be a ‘silencing’ epigenetic mark for gene expression.1,43 At present, the improved high-throughput sequencing technology provides new insight into the functions of DNA methylation, and an increasing number of genome-scale methylome analyses have revealed that the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than initially realized.44–46 For example, a genome-wide analysis of the interplay among DNA methylation, histone methylation and gene expression in rice indicated that ‘promoter region methylation may not affect transcription’, in contrast to previous studies.41 However, a more recent single-base resolution analysis of the rice methylome revealed that the promoter methylation negatively correlated to gene transcripts, but the negative correlation was only significant for these heavily-methylated genes.47 In contrast, gene body methylation was usually positively correlated with gene expression.47 Consistent with these findings, genome-scale analysis of DNA methylation variation associated with gene expression in Arabidopsis also verified the positive correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression and presented a more explicit point that DNA methylation only marginally contributed to gene transcripts.46 Correspondingly, our results also presented a complicated relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression and no obvious correlations between methylation and gene transcripts at the genome-wide level (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, our results also showed that abundant gene expression alterations were not negatively related to the changes in DNA methylation (Supplementary Fig. S9). Similarly, methylome analysis of tomato fruit under chilling stress indicated that only 37–67% of different GO term genes presented a negative correlation between methylation level and gene expression.48 Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of Arabidopsis plants exposed to a pathogen also demonstrated that abundant DEGs were not directly targeted by DNA methylation, but DNA methylation was at least partially responsible for the transcriptional control of these genes.49 Correspondingly, the exploration of possible causal relationships among genetic variation, methylation variation and expression variation in Arabidopsis also showed that DNA methylation could directly and indirectly regulate gene expression.46 Taken together, the poor correlation between methylation variations and expression alterations in this study were mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the regions in which methylation changes did not affect gene expression, like some gene body regions; (2) gene expression changes that were not directly controlled by DNA methylation.Interestingly, carotenoid degradation was observed in 5azaC-treated callus. Further analysis revealed that the up-regulation of CpCCD1 contributed to carotenoid degradation in response to 5azaC treatment. We analyzed the methylation levels of the CpCCD1 promoter and exon regions by bisulfite sequencing and tried to link the phenotype to changes in methylation. However, the results indicated that the activation of CpCCD1 was not directly regulated by methylation changes (Fig. 10). As mentioned above, DNA methylation could indirectly regulate expression alterations. For example, chilling stress on tomato fruit increased the methylation levels of RIN (RIPENING INHIBITOR) TF and decreased the levels of RIN transcripts, resulting in the down-regulation of RIN binding target genes.48 This finding indicated that DNA methylation could affect transcriptional networks by regulating up-stream TFs. Similarly, Paper bagging altered DNA methylation and histone modifications on MdMYB1 and activated the MdMYB1 gene and its downstream genes, leading to differential anthocyanin pigmentation.50 The differential methylation of the MYB promoter also altered the MYB transcripts, resulting in differential anthocyanin accumulation in apple and pear.6,7 Excluding TFs, the indirect regulation of DNA methylation could be mediated by multiple mechanisms, like hormone pathways. Methylome analysis of Arabidopsis exposed to a pathogen revealed that DNA methylation activated transcripts of genes involved in the SA pathway and affected the expression levels of abundant SA downstream genes.49 Compared with the regulation of structural genes, it is understandable that plants prefer a more highly efficient and energy-saving way of controlling TFs or hormone pathways to further regulate biological processes. Thus, the activation of CpCCD1 was not directly controlled by methylation but was rather the consequence of methylation-dependent alterations in transcription networks. Concerning the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in CCDs, a recent study revealed that the TF SPL15 strongly and specifically interacted with the CCD gene promoter to regulate carotenoid accumulation in Arabidopsis.51 Moreover, transcripts of CCD1 were activated by hormonal treatments including ABA and strigolactone, and abiotic stresses including salt, drought and cold in Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea.52 In this study, the RNA-seq data show that 5azaC treatment as a stimulant induced callus stress reactions (Fig. 5) and activated peroxidase gene expression and enzyme activities (Supplementary Fig. S7). These findings implied that the stress reaction caused by 5azaC could also contribute to the up-regulation of CpCCD1. Taken together, although our results indicated that DNA methylation was not directly responsible for CpCCD1 activation, it might be controlled by up-stream TFs or interaction factors (IFs), or hormonal pathways, among others, to affect CpCCD1 expression.In total, a model was established to explain the effect of 5azaC on carotenoid degradation (Fig. 11). Transcriptional activation of CpCCD1 was potentially regulated by upstream TFs or IFs (interaction factors) that were induced by 5azaC treatment. However, 5azaC as a stimulator triggered the stress response in callus, and stress enhanced the transcriptional abundance of CpCCD1. The up-regulated CpCCD1 reacted with carotenoids and induced carotenoid degradation. The decrease in upstream carotenoid also blocked ABA biosynthesis. Moreover, the carotenoid degradation could also be associated with 5azaC stress. Correspondingly, 5azaC treatment stimulated callus peroxidation processes, and POD genes and enzyme activities were strongly activated to reduce the levels of peroxide. Furthermore, 5azaC induced the transcriptional profiles of ‘Phenlypropanoids’, ‘lignin and lignans’ and ‘Flavonoids’ pathways in response to 5azaC stress (Fig. 11). A model was established to explain the effect of 5azaC on carotenoid degradation. The 5azaC treatment potentially activated upstream TFs or IFs (interaction factors) and then induced CpCCD1 expression levels. Additionally, 5azaC as a stimulator triggered the stress response in callus, and the stress enhanced the transcriptional abundance of CpCCD1. The up-regulated CpCCD1 induced carotenoid degradation. The decrease in carotenoids also blocked ABA biosynthesis. Moreover, carotenoid degradation could also be associated with stress induced by 5azaC treatment.A model was established to explain the effect of 5azaC on carotenoid degradation.

Finally, we constructed the first public S. scrofa circRNA database, allowing researchers to query comprehensive annotation, expression, and regulatory networks of circRNAs.1. IntroductionCircular RNAs (circRNAs) were generally believed to be linear until their circular form was observed via electron microscopy in 1979.1 CircRNA is formed by exon-scrambling, in which a splice donor is spliced to an upstream acceptor rather than a downstream acceptor during transcription. While exons are most common, some introns can also form circRNAs during transcription. Usually, circRNAs are expressed at a relatively low level. CircRNAs have been identified in large numbers by deep RNA sequencing and are believed to be widely expressed in eukaryotic cells.2–6 Most circRNA is flanked by GT/AG splice sites reflecting back-splicing. CircRNA back-splicing locations are in nearly the same locations in orthologous genes and exons in animals, showing that circRNAs are conserved in animals4,7 and plants.6 Although many circRNAs have been discovered in mouse and human, little is known about circRNAs in other mammals.CircRNA expression is spatio-temporally regulated in Drosophila brains,7 pig brains,8 and mouse pre-implantation embryos.5 CircRNAs also show tissue-specific expression in the heart and lung during human fetal development.9 It is believed that circRNAs bind miRNAs and thus regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. For example, CDR1as functions as an efficient miRNA sponge, binding miR-7 and allowing mRNAs to escape degradation following miRNA binding.2,10,Sry can form a circRNA that is also proposed to act as a miRNA sponge.10 In addition to regulating mRNA translocation by acting as a miRNA sponge, circRNA can also regulate transcription through specific RNA–RNA interactions. A recently described subclass of circRNAs, EIciRNAs, contains introns among exons after RNA circling. In human cells, some EIciRNAs associate with RNA polymerase II, thus interacting with U1 snRNP and enhancing parental gene expression in cis.11 The functions of circRNAs remain largely unclear. Investigating the spatio-temporal distribution of circRNAs is critical to understanding their biological functions. However, little is known about the expression patterns of circRNAs across organs and developmental stages in mammals.The domestic pig (Sus scrofa) has had a close and complex relationship with humans for at least 10,000 years.12–14 The pig is an important domesticated farm animal that provides protein for humans, as well as a non-rodent animal model used in biomedical research. In comparison with traditional rodent models, the pig is more similar to humans in body size, growth, development, immunity, physiology, and metabolism, as well as genomic sequence.15–17 Recent studies of the S. scrofa genome and transcriptome have increased the utility of this species as a biomedical model.14,18–21 However, in comparison with mice and humans, knowledge regarding the pig transcriptome across organs and developmental stages is very limited.22–25 Thousands of circRNAs have been discovered in fetal pig brains;8 however, the identities and expression profiles of S. scrofa circRNAs remain largely uncharacterized.We performed genome-wide analysis of circRNA across nine organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, ovarium, testis, muscle, and fat) and three skeletal muscles at multiple developmental stages (0, 30, and 240 days after birth) from Guizhou miniature pigs (a native Chinese pig in the Guizhou province), which are widely used as an animal model in biomedical research. We systematically identified S. scrofa circRNAs and analysed their molecular properties, sequence conservation, spatio-temporal expression patterns, potential functions, and binding sites for miRNAs. Finally, we constructed the first public S. scrofa circRNA database.2. Materials and methodsNine organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, ovarium, testis, skeletal muscle, and fat, were collected from three male and female Guizhou miniature pigs at postnatal day 240. We also collected longissimus muscle samples from three Guizhou miniature pigs at postnatal days 0 and 30. Total RNA was isolated from each sample by TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols, after which total RNA was pooled by tissue type and age for RNA-seq analysis. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end reads 100 bp in length were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq 2500. RNA-seq data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession codes GSE73763).Reads were first mapped to the pig genome by Bowtie2,26 after which the mapped reads were filtered out by SAMtools.27 For the unmapped reads, 20 mers were cut off from both ends of each paired-end read, after which the remaining 60 mers were aligned to the pig genome in reverse orientation by Bowtie2.26 We used the find_circ package2,4 to identify circRNA. The workflow is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5.In this study, a circRNA was designated as conserved when it was produced from orthologous genes in different species. We extracted pig-to-human and pig-to-mouse orthologous gene tables from BioMart (www.biomart.org). Human and mouse circRNAs were identified by a previous study.4,28CircRNA expression was quantified by calculating the number of junction spanning reads per million reads of each sample. Junction spanning reads that were less than 5 reads supported were excluded when determining circRNA expression levels. Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified by the chi-square test with P = 0.05 and had fold-change = 2 (or = 0.5) between any two tissues samples.Four-hundred and eleven mature pig miRNA sequences were obtained from miRBase.29 We used microtar,30 Miranda,31 and RNAhybrid32 to identify circRNA binding sites for miRNAs. To decrease the proportion of false-positive results, intersections predicted by all three programs were treated as the final set of target miRNAs.The circRNA database is composed of a web interface and a SQLite database engine, which is used to store and manage all data. The data processing programs are written in Python (version 3.4.4). The web interface is built by Django (version 1.8.13) a Python Web framework. Google© charts (https://developers.google.com/chart/) and D3.js (https://d3js.org/) were used for interface development. The circRNA database is coded as a Django project and is deployed by uWSGI (https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io). Web services were built using nginx (version 2.10.0), an HTTP and reverse proxy server.3. Results3.1. Identification and characteristics of S. scrofa circRNAsTo perform comprehensive profiling of circular RNA in pigs, we carried out total RNA sequencing in nine adult organs (including fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, testis, ovarium, and skeletal muscle) and three skeletal muscles at 0, 30, and 240 days after birth. In this study, the identified circRNAs were flanked by GT/AG splice sites and had unambiguous break points. The genomic distance between two splice sites was less than 100 kb, and each circRNA was supported by at least 2 reads in each sample. We identified 5,934 unique circRNAs in all assessed biological tissues (Supplementary Table S1).The analysis of chromosome distribution showed that circRNAs are widely and unevenly transcribed from S. scrofa chromosomes (SSCs). More circRNAs were generated from SSC1 and SSC6 in comparison with the other SSCs. Only three circRNAs were detected on SSC-Y (Fig. 1A). The number of circRNAs was not significantly related to chromosome length or the number of genes contained in each chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most circRNAs contain multiple exons, and some circRNAs also retain introns, as indicated in a previous study.33 According to the pig genes and splice junction annotations in the Ensembl database (release 78, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-78/gtf/sus_scrofa), we found that most circularizing events typically encompass less than 5 exons (average exons = 4.8). More than 90% of circRNAs are formed by multiple exons, while only 9.9% are formed by a single exon (Fig. 1B). This finding is in agreement with observations in mice.5Identification and feature of circRNAs in pigs.

(A) Chromosome distribution of circRNAs, the curve line represents the density of circRNAs along chromosome. (B) Distribution of exon number for circRNAs and mRNA. (C) Genomic location of circRNAs. (D) GC contents of circRNAs comparing with mRNA, miRNA and lincRNA.CircRNAs are mostly comprised of coding sequence (CDS, 68.40%) and intergenic regions (21.93%), whereas a smaller fraction (10%) also contain 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs), 3'-UTRs, or both UTRs (Fig. 1C), in agreement with a previous report.4 The distribution of circRNA exonic sequence lengths resembles that of human circRNA, with a median length of 509 nucleotides, whereas that of human circRNA is 547 nucleotides.4 Most S. scrofa circRNAs are shorter than 2 kb (4,243/5,934 = 71.5%), similar to mouse circRNAs.5 The GC content of S. scrofa circRNA is similar to that of other small RNAs, with an average GC content of 42.67% (Fig. 1D).3.2. Sequence conservation among pig, human, and mouse circRNAsSeveral studies suggest that some circRNAs are evolutionarily conserved among humans and mice.4,34–36 Indeed, 81 of 1,903 mouse circRNAs were mapped to human circRNAs in a report by Memczak.2 Using the liftOver tool, another study found that 28.5% of mouse circRNAs are conserved in humans, while 33.3% of these circRNAs have no human homolog.35 To investigate circRNA sequence conservation between pigs and other mammals, we compared pig circRNAs to human and mouse circRNAs with clear one-to-one orthologs (http://asia.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/). We found that 20.20% of pig circRNAs have human orthologs, whereas 16.96% of pig circRNAs have mouse orthologs (Fig. 2A). These observations are comparable with previous reports. Molecular characteristics of S. scrofa circRNA. (A) Sequence conservation of S. scrofa circRNA compared with human and mouse ones, respectively. The percentage means that if there is a circRNA in pig, there is also have an otology circRNA in human or mouse.

(B) Sequences identity of flanking introns of a circRNA 5' end upstream and a 3' end downstream. (C) Distribution of flanking intron sequences lengths for circRNA. (D) Distribution of sequences identity of each intron pair that flanked circRNA.To assess whether pig and human circRNAs arise from orthologous exons, we used whole-genome alignments to identify regions of the human genome that correspond to pig circRNAs and quantified the degree to which pig circRNAs overlapped with these regions. We found that 29.4% of pig circRNAs have orthologous exons in humans. In mice, 28.6% of circRNAs overlap with human circRNAs.35 Blast analysis suggested that 1,510 (1510/5934 = 25.45%) and 5,189 (5189/5934 = 87.44%) S. scrofa circRNAs have orthologs in mice and humans, respectively (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These findings indicate that pig, human, and mouse circRNAs are modestly conserved and often generated from orthologous genes. Moreover, our sequence conservation analysis suggests that circRNA might have conserved functions in pigs, mice, and humans.3.3. S. scrofa circRNAs are flanked by long intronsThe sequence conservation of circRNAs among species indicated that their mechanisms of biogenesis might also be conserved. Previous studies suggested that most circRNAs are derived from exons with long flanking introns, which usually contain reverse complementary matches (RCMs) that facilitate back-splicing of the enclosed circRNAs.7,37–39 To determine whether introns flank pig circRNAs, we analysed 5kb sequences length of both 5' upstream and 3' downstream sequences flanking pig circRNAs. We observed that the majority of circularized exons are flanked by upstream and downstream introns. We found that 60.4% of 5' sequences upstream of circRNAs contain introns, whereas 62.4% of 3' sequences downstream of circRNAs contain introns. Moreover, 29.1 and 28.0% of the assessed regions upstream and downstream of circRNAs are intergenic regions. Few sequences flanking circRNAs are CDS, 5'-UTRs, or 3'-UTRs (Fig. 2B). We found that 2,641 circRNAs are flanked by intron sequences on the 5' and 3' ends. The median length of the flanking introns on both sides of the identified circRNAs is 5,040 bp (Fig. 2C). Our analysis suggests that long flanking introns are an intrinsic determinant of RNA circularization in pigs. Mammalian circRNAs have been reported to have relatively long flanking introns.7,33 We aligned the introns of each intron pair that flanked a circRNA using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). We observed that 1,810 circRNAs share RCMs of at least 100 bp in pigs (Fig. 2D). The lengths of long introns are not randomly distributed among circularized exons in the genome.8 Short intronic repeat sequences and complementary sequences facilitate RNA circularization.3,38 In our study, few circRNAs flanking intronic repeat sequences were detected, but the RCMs detected in our experiments are longer than previously reported RCMs; these characteristics may be typical of S. scrofa circRNAs.3.4. circRNA isoforms and diversity of circularization patternMost genes generated one or two circRNAs, but some genes yielded multiple distinct circularized products (Fig. 3A). We identified 4,928 circRNAs generated from 2,538 annotated host genes. Among the identified circRNAs, 85.7% are produced by ‘hot-spot’ host genes that generate more than two circRNAs. This finding has been reported in other studies of circRNAs.3,5,8 A striking example is the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 gene (CHD2), which is involved in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and may generate as many as 40 distinct circRNAs (at least two unique back-spliced reads). CircRNA isoforms provide insight into the mechanism of circRNA biogenesis and the manner in which circRNAs are regulated. It is notable that, because de novo circRNA detection was performed without prior knowledge of annotated exons, 1,006 of the identified circRNAs fall outside the genomic regions of annotated genes.

(E) ssc-ciR-03122 is abundantly expressed in kidney. (F) Tissue and age-dependent differential expression for two circRNA isoforms in PTGES3.There are structural complexities among well-expressed circRNAs. circRNAs produced from back-splicing have splicing signals at their junctions.4 Introns spliced by the major spliceosome usually contain the GT dinucleotide at their 5' end (the splice donor) and the AG dinucleotide at their 3' end (the splice acceptor).40 Most circRNAs contain one or a few exons; however, many circRNA are supported by abundant back-spliced reads that traverse multiple exons. More than one GT donor site often exists for a given AG acceptor splicing site. We found that this situation is common when GT donors are more than one exon away from AG acceptor sites; such genes generate multiple circular RNAs. For example, DIS3L2, an important factor in mRNA degradation,41,42 regulates Let-7g expression and apoptosis by targeting TGFBR1 and down-regulating the activity of TGF-ß pathway.43 In our study, the DIS3L2 gene was found to yield three circRNA isoforms, ssc-ciR-05526, ssc-ciR-05527, and ssc-ciR-05528, of 349 bp, 523 bp, and 603 bp in length, respectively (Fig. 3B). The circular fractions of ssc-ciR-05526, ssc-ciR-05527, and ssc-ciR-05528 (ratio of the circular isoform relative to all transcripts from the same locus) are 3.8, 23.2, and 17.3%, respectively. Many circRNAs have different acceptors, but share the same donor. For example, host gene RBM25 produces two circRNA isoforms as shown in Fig. 3C. This analysis suggests the existence of alternative and interleaved splicing events, where the same splice sites can participate in multiple forward and backward splicing reactions, either to adjacent exons or to distant skipped exons.We further assessed the abundance of circRNA isoforms, revealing dissimilar expression profiles among different circRNAs originating from the same host gene. Expression profiles of this type have also been observed by other groups.8,44 For example, among the three circRNA isoforms of DIS3L2, ssc-ciR-05527 is highly expressed in the lung, testis, and skeletal muscle at D240, whereas ssc-ciR-05526 and ssc-ciR-05528 were only detected in the testis (Fig. 3D). ssc-ciR-03122, the predominant circRNA from the RBM25 gene, is abundantly expressed in the kidney, while its other four circRNA isoforms are weakly expressed or not detected in most tissues (Fig. 3E). Among circRNA isoforms generated from PTGES3, ssc-ciR-01789 is widely expressed in all tissues and abundantly expressed in the testis and skeletal muscle. Expression of ssc-ciR-01789 in skeletal muscle was age-dependent. However, ssc-ciR-01788 from PTGES3 is weakly expressed only in the kidney and testis (Fig. 3F). Another study revealed that some host genes produce multiple circRNAs with dissimilar expression profiles.45 Collectively, these results suggest that back-splicing by alternative spliceosomes generates circRNA isoforms and contributes to the diversity and functional complexity of circRNAs.3.5. S. scrofa circRNAs potentially act as miRNA spongesA previous study indicated that circRNAs function as miRNA sponges to indirectly regulate mRNA expression.2,10 To assess whether pig circRNAs regulate gene transcription by binding to miRNAs, we predicted miRNA binding sites of circRNAs using computational methods. We found 4,436 (74.8%), 4,432 (74.7%), and 2,279 (38.4%) putative miRNA-binding sites on 5,394 circRNAs using the micrnada, RNAhybrid, and microtar programs, respectively (Supplementary Table S4, Fig. 4A). Moreover, we observed a significant positive relationship between the number of miRNA binding sites and circRNA length (Supplementary Fig. S2). To reduce the number of predicted false-positive miRNA targets, only miRNAs considered as targets of circRNAs identified using all three programs were further assessed in our study. We identified 1,842 circRNAs with miRNA binding sites that were predicted by all three prediction methods (Fig. 4B); while most circRNAs were predicted to have no potential binding sites (Supplementary Table S4). The miRNA-binding sites were not equally distributed in the circRNAs, only 441 circRNAs out of 1842 (22.20%) had more than 20 potential biding sites (Fig. 4C).

(C) Number of miRNA binding sites for circRNAs. (D) A view of interaction between miRNA and circRNAs.Subsequently, we analysed interactions between differentially expressed circRNAs and predicted target miRNAs. The resulting circRNA–miRNA association network provided nodes and connections between circRNAs and their target miRNAs. According to our data, no miRNA was regulated by only one circRNA. For example, miRNA-378 is involved in a regulatory pathway for circRNA ciR-90. In total, 141 miRNAs and 81 circRNA host genes were involved in this network (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that circRNAs could regulate gene expression by functioning as miRNA sponges. We found that each circRNA can contain more than one miRNA binding site and can bind to more than one miRNA. Although these in silico results should be investigated in vivo, these results illuminate the manner in which circRNAs regulate mRNA translation.3.6. Dominant circRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and highly enriched in the testisTo act as miRNA sponges or perform other non-catalytic cellular functions, circRNAs must be expressed at a consequential level within a cell or region of tissue.4 Here, in order to gain insight into the circRNA landscape across different organs and infer the abundance of each circRNA, we multiplied the circular fraction of each circRNA by the density of RNA-seq reads arising from the cognate gene locus (measured in fragment per kilobase of transcript per million fragments sequenced, or FPKM) (Supplementary Table S5). Most circRNAs are expressed with relatively low abundance.4,46 In this study, the average abundance of each S. scrofa circRNA was 0.45 FPKM. When considering the 395 circRNAs with inferred FPKM = 1.0, only 43 had FPKM = 10.0, while 4 had FPKM = 100. To test whether circRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in pigs, a clustered heatmap was generated for nine organs (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that pig circRNAs have highly tissue-specific expression patterns (Fig. 5A). The largest cluster of circRNAs was in the testis and appeared to be testis-specific (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, circRNA ssc-ciR-03062, which is generated from MYH7 and MYH6, which are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,47,48 was the most abundantly expressed circRNA in the heart and was highly expressed in skeletal muscle.

(E) KEGG term enrichments of circRNAs reveal many genes sets that were specific in tissues.We found that 339–3,169 circRNAs were detected across most tissues types, and the testis had more than nine times as many circRNAs as the spleen (Fig. 5B). Some circRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, but most are found in only a few tissue types (Fig. 5C). We found that only 37 circRNAs are expressed in all nine organs analysed in this study. This variation was not explained by differences in sequencing depth. It is notable that 53.86% of the identified circRNAs (3,196/5,934 = 53.86%) were detected in the testis; however, 70.86% (2,265/3,196 = 70.86%) of the identified circRNAs were only observed in one other tissue type (Fig. 5B). Tissue-specific circRNAs are a group of circRNAs whose function and expression are confined to one or several tissues.49,50 As shown in Supplementary Table S6, the testis shows the largest number of tissue-specific circRNAs (1,155), followed by the heart (205 circRNAs), muscle (174 circRNAs), and fat (147 circRNAs). The lowest number of tissue-specific circRNAs was found in the liver (53 circRNAs) (Table 1). It is notable that we did not detect any spleen-specific circRNAs. We assessed enrichment of gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms among the tissue-specific circRNAs. In the heart, GO terms related to muscle development, construction, cell differentiation, and actin filament-based processes are highly enriched (Supplementary Table S7). Pathway analysis indicates that the set of circRNAs specific to the heart is significantly enriched in genes related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac muscle contraction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and the Wnt signalling pathway (Fig. 5E). Classification of circRNA expression in different tissuesClassification of circRNA expression in different tissuesFurthermore, we also analysed tissue-enriched (expression level at least 5-fold higher in a particular tissue as compared to all other tissues51) and tissue-enhanced (at least 5-fold higher expression level in a particular tissue as compared to the average level in all tissues51) circRNA. We identified 2,167 tissue-enriched circRNAs (Supplementary Table S8) and 3,301 tissue-enhanced circRNAs (Supplementary Table S9) across all nine assessed tissue types. The numbers of tissue-enriched and tissue-enhanced genes are highly variable among the analysed tissue types (Table 1, Fig. 5D). The testis shows the largest number of tissue-enriched circRNAs (1,192), followed by the heart (223) and skeletal muscle (186). These results indicate that circRNAs are expressed with highly tissue-specific patterns in pigs. A previous study also reported that dominant circular RNAs were expressed in a tissue-specific manner during human fetal development.93.7. Differentially expressed circRNAs in postnatal skeletal muscleSkeletal muscles allow movement of the body via energy expenditure. Postnatal growth of skeletal muscle is mainly realized through increases in the length and girth of muscle fibres, but not by increases in muscle fibre number.52 To understand the regulation of circRNAs in skeletal muscle, we performed expression profiling of circRNAs in skeletal muscle at postnatal days 0, 30, and 240 (designated D0, D30, and D240, respectively). This profiling allowed evaluation of dynamic changes in circRNA expression from birth until adulthood and identification of circRNAs associated with muscle growth. We detected 1,489 circRNAs expressed with more than two reads in at least one sample (Supplementary Table S10). Of these 1,489 skeletal muscle circRNAs, 597 circRNAs were detected at D0, whereas 670 were detected at D30 and 673 were detected at D240; 57.2–63.9% of skeletal muscle circRNAs were detected at only one stage (Fig. 6A). The identified skeletal muscle circRNAs were studied further to assess changes in their expression levels during skeletal muscle growth. To obtain an overview of spatial circRNA expression changes in developmental skeletal muscle, we clustered pig circRNA expression data from D0, D30, and D240, revealing differential circRNA expression between growth stages. Interestingly, cluster analysis showed that skeletal muscle at D30 had a circRNA expression profile more similar to that of skeletal muscle at D240 than to that of skeletal muscle at D0 (Fig. 6B).

(D–E) Differentially expressed circRNA between different growth stages in postnatal skeletal muscle.Next, we focused on abundant circRNAs in skeletal muscle. Notably, we found that several of the most abundant circRNAs in skeletal muscle originate from protein coding genes with pivotal roles in skeletal muscle growth and hypertrophy (e.g. MYH1, MYH2, MYH3, MYH6, MYH7, MYL12B, IGFBP5) or non-coding RNAs with roles in slow-twitch fibre formation (miRNA-208b encoded by introns of myosin genes) (Fig. 6C).53,54,MYH1, MYH6, and MYH7 belong to the MYH myosin superfamily. Myosin, the primary component of thick filaments, is widely expressed in mammalian skeletal muscle and involved in muscle contraction, phagocytosis, cell motility, and vesicle transport.55,56 Recent studies reported that myosins are associated with skeletal muscle development and influence the quality of pork.57–59 We analysed the expression patterns of all circRNAs detected in skeletal muscle, revealing 16 expression patterns and significant enrichment in cluster 5 (Supplementary Fig. S3). GO analysis of circRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle did not reveal significant enrichment in GO terms.To study functional transitions in skeletal muscle development, we assessed two types of differentially expressed circRNAs (DEC) between time points. We focused on circRNAs with fold-change >2, P-value < 0.05, and FDR < 0.1. The expression levels of most circRNAs are not significantly altered during postnatal skeletal muscle growth. Type 1 DECs were defined as those that were differentially expressed between two closed time points. We detected 101 and 83 differently expressed circRNAs in the D0 versus D30 and D30 versus D240 analyses, respectively. Among these DECs, 75 circRNAs were up-regulated at D30 in comparison with D0, whereas 26 circRNAs were up-regulated at D0 in comparison with D30 (Supplementary Table S11, Fig. 6D). In the D30 versus D240 group, 58 circRNAs were up-regulated at D240 in comparison with D30, whereas 25 circRNAs were up-regulated at D30 in comparison with D240 (Supplementary Table S12, Fig. 6E). Under the assumption that the functions of circRNAs are related to the functions of their host genes, we performed GO and KEGG pathway analysis to predict the functions of DECs during postnatal growth of skeletal muscle. The GO analysis indicated that the host genes of the D0 versus D30 DECs are significantly associated with muscle development (Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, for the D30 versus D240 DECs, host genes are associated with homeostatic processes such as ion homeostasis and cation homeostasis (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Pathway analysis indicated that the host genes of the D0 versus D30 DECs are involved in tight junction signalling (Table 2). In the D30 versus D240 group, circRNA host genes are significantly associated with the calcium signalling pathway and aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption signalling pathway. The overall induction of circRNAs during skeletal muscle development indicates that circularization is likely important for muscle function, because many circRNAs are up- or down-regulated at different time points of skeletal muscle growth. Pathway analysis of parent genes of circRNAsNote: Significantly over-represented KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways detected with DAVID for parent genes of circRNAs that are differently expressed with at least a twofold changes in group D0 versus D30 and D30 versus D240, respectively.Pathway analysis of parent genes of circRNAsNote: Significantly over-represented KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways detected with DAVID for parent genes of circRNAs that are differently expressed with at least a twofold changes in group D0 versus D30 and D30 versus D240, respectively.Type 2 DECs were defined as circRNAs that were differentially expressed only in the D0 versus D30 or D30 versus D240 analyses, representing circRNAs that were up- or down-regulated only between two consecutive time points during muscle growth. We found 29 circRNAs that were differentially expressed in the D0 versus D30 comparison, but not in the D30 versus D240 comparison (Supplementary Table 13). Notably, several circRNAs generated from MYH1, MYH2, MYH6, MYH7, and TNNC2, as well as miRNA-208b, were significantly differentially expressed only in the D0 versus D30 comparison. These host genes mainly encoded proteins associated with muscle development and fibre twitching. We found 24 circRNAs that were differentially expressed in the comparison of D30 and D240, but not in the comparison of D0 and D30 (Supplementary Table S14). Interestingly, these circRNAs were mainly generated from NDFIP2, RBM6, RYR1, SEC24A, RYR1, RBM24, SAR1B, PLEKHF1, ATP1A2, ATP1A4, DCUN1D1, ATP1A2, PRSS22, and PHKB, which encode proteins associated with glycosaminoglycan metabolism and calcium channels. These circRNAs could signify the onset/termination of growth and/or physiological processes at a particular developmental stage.3.8. S. scrofa circRNA databaseIn order to facilitate dissemination of information regarding circRNA annotation, circRNA expression, potential circRNA functions, and circRNA–miRNA–gene interactions, we created a database of S. scrofa circRNAs that was designated pigcirNet (http://lnc.rnanet.org/circ). The web interface of pigcirNet is summarized in Fig. 7. PigcirNet shows circRNA location, circular nucleotide length, strand signal, gene Entrez ID, Ensembl id, gene symbol, classification, and expression level across all organs and stages selected in this study. Information regarding prediction of circRNA targeting by miRNAs and circRNA–miRNA interactions are also available in pigcirNet. In order to investigate potential functions of circRNAs, we retrieve GO information with host-related genes. We also search the PubMed database to retrieve reports related to queried circRNAs. A Google© chart is used to display a diagram of circRNA abundance, whereas sigma.js is used to show a circRNA, mRNA, and miRNA interaction network. circRNAs can be browsed by their chromosomal location, classification, or tissue-specific expression pattern. We also provide a search box, in which users can find related circRNAs by searching circRNA id, gene symbol, gene Entrez ID, or gene Ensembl ID. To the best of our knowledge, our database is the first public circRNA resource for a non-rodent mammal. Framework of the database construction in pigcirNet.

DiscussionGenome-wide analyses of RNA-seq data have revealed that circRNAs are abundant in animal transcriptomes and identified thousands of circRNAs in humans,2,60 mice,4 nematodes,2 and drosophila.7,37 Guo et al. detected 7,112 human circRNAs using 39 biological samples of whole-cell non-poly(A)-selected RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project.4 Gao et al. applied the CIRI algorithm to identify nearly 98,526 circRNAs based on ENCODE RNA-seq data from 15 cell lines.60 Based on 464 RNA-seq samples across 26 human tissues and 104 disease conditions,61 Liu and colleagues identified 212,950 human circRNAs (53,687 novel circRNAs). These findings suggest that a large number of circRNAs remain unknown and indicate that additional circRNAs can be identified by improving RNA analysis methods and accumulating deeper sequencing data. Because circRNAs are expressed in a highly spatio-temporal specific manner, it is essential that studies of circRNAs in mammals assess various tissues, conditions, and developmental stages. The pig is an important farm animal that provides protein for humans and an important non-rodent animal model that is widely used in biomedical research. Morten et al., the first group to study S. scrofa circRNAs, identified 4,634 unique circRNAs from 2,195 host genes in five brain tissue types at six time-points during fetal porcine development, and the results suggested that some circRNAs were conserved between humans and mice.8 To perform genome-wide identification of S. scrofa circRNAs and explore their spatio-temporal expression patterns, we carried out total RNA sequencing across nine organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, ovarium, testis, skeletal muscle, and fat) and skeletal muscle at three developmental stages (0, 30, and 240 days after birth). We identified 5,934 S. scrofa circRNAs, which represent a significant addition to the growing catalogue of annotated mammalian circRNAs. The circRNAs CDR1as and Sry were well-known studied. However, we did not detect circRNAs formed by a CDR1as orthologue or Sry in our data. Sry is induced during embryonic development.62 Because circRNAs are expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner, S. scrofa circRNAs orthologous to CDR1as and Sry were probably not expressed in the tissues selected in our study. To validate this conjecture, we further analysed expression of CDR1 and Sry. As expected, we did not detect expression of CDR1 or Sry in any tissue, Neither CDR1 nor Sry were mentioned in Morten’s study of the pig brain,8 indicating that these circRNAs were not expressed in these samples. We analysed a limited set of tissues and developmental stages in this study. Thus, the true number of S. scrofa circRNAs is almost certainly much larger than that reported in this study. In comparison with humans, knowledge of S. scrofa circRNAs remains limited. Therefore, deeper RNA-sequencing to identify circRNAs across additional organs and developmental stages in pigs is essential.Although the molecular functions of circRNAs are mostly unclear, some circRNAs affect gene expression by acting as microRNA sponges. The most emblematical examples of circRNAs that act as microRNA sponges are CDR1as/ciRS-7 and Sry, which function in human and mouse brain development.2,10 Guo et al. predicted that circRNAs from the human C2H2 zinc finger gene family function as miRNA sponges.4 Another study showed that Drosophila circular RNAs harbour >1000 well-conserved canonical miRNA seed matches.7 To assess whether S. scrofa circRNAs affect post-transcriptional gene regulation by binding to miRNAs, we predicted circRNA-originating targets by three computational methods. We found that 1,842 of 5,934 (31.04%) circRNAs had putative miRNA-binding sites. In a study of rice, 17.33% (235/1356) of circRNAs were found to have putative miRNA-binding sites.63 The identified circRNAs had, on average, 19 miRNA-binding sites. There was a significant positive relationship between the number of miRNA-binding sites and circRNA sequence length (Supplementary Fig. S2). Based on our analysis of circRNAs, we constructed an interaction network of miRNAs and circular RNAs. Certainly, the potential genome-wide interplay between miRNAs and circular RNAs warrants further experimental and computational investigation in the future. Although the aforementioned studies indicated that some circRNAs function as miRNA sponges, 4,092 of 5,934 (68.96%) S. scrofa circRNAs identified in this study have no putative miRNA binding site. Several studies have suggested that most circRNAs do not act as miRNA sponges.4,63 These findings indicate that circRNAs have functions other than binding to miRNAs, including regulation of host gene transcription, protein binding, and translation.11,64Spatio-temporal gene expression patterns reveal the functions of genes within specific tissues/cells at specific times during development. Several studies have revealed that circRNAs tend to show tissue-/stage-specific expression7–9 and enrichment in the brain.35 We also identified tissue-specific, tissue-enriched, and tissue-enhanced circRNAs, providing important information regarding their functions. Of the identified heart-specific circRNAs, for example, ssc-ciR-03925, ssc-ciR-03394, ssc-ciR-03072, ssc-ciR-05708, ssc-ciR-02839, ssc-ciR-02761, ssc-ciR-04971, ssc-ciR-04972, and ssc-ciR-03852 were specifically expressed in the heart. ssc-ciR-04971 is generated from host gene RYR2, mutations in which are associated with stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.65 Ssc-ciR-03072 is produced from host gene MYH7, changes in the relative abundance of which are correlated with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle; mutations in MYH7 are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing early onset distal myopathy.66,67 These findings suggest that heart-specific circRNAs might be involved in heart development and cardiac disease.Skeletal muscle mass increases during postnatal animal development via hypertrophy.68 The role of circRNAs in skeletal muscle development is unknown. Therefore, we analysed dynamic changes in circRNA abundance during postnatal growth of skeletal muscle. We identified 149 circRNAs that were differentially expressed between the selected time points and thus might be associated with postnatal growth of skeletal muscle. No studies have assessed the role of circRNAs in myogenesis. The D0 versus D30 DECs and D30 versus D240 DECs differed significantly with respect to enriched GO terms and signalling pathways. The D0 vs. D30 DECs were markedly enriched in GO terms associated with muscle contraction, muscle organ development, and chromatin modification, while the D30 versus D240 DECs were enriched in GO terms associated with cellular cation homeostasis, ATP hydrolysis-coupled proton transport, energy-coupled proton transport against the electrochemical gradient, and response to hypoxia. KEGG analysis suggested that DECs were mainly enriched in the tight junction pathway for the D0 versus D30 group, while DECs in the D30 versus D240 group were significantly associated with calcium signalling and aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption signalling. Tight junction proteins participate in the regulation of cell proliferation, gene expression, and cell differentiation.69,70 A previous study showed that proliferation and fusion of satellite cells, leading to an increase in the number of myonuclei, may also regulate muscle growth during the early, but not late, stages of postnatal development.68 Our study indicated that circRNAs (such as ssc-ciR-02753, ssc-ciR-04353, ssc-ciR-04335, ssc-ciR-04349, ssc-ciR-04348, ssc-ciR-04359, ssc-ciR-03066, ssc-ciR-03069, and ssc-ciR-03065) may regulate muscle growth by affecting cell proliferation and fusion during early postnatal muscle development. Clustering analysis suggested that the circRNA expression profile of skeletal muscle at D30 was more similar to that of skeletal muscle at D240 than to that of skeletal muscle at D0. We speculate that circRNAs such as ssc-ciR-01595, ssc-ciR-01592, ssc-ciR-03395, ssc-ciR-02589, ssc-ciR-02611, and ssc-ciR-02610 contribute to muscle plasticity and contraction. Some circRNAs are evolutionarily conserved in terms of sequence and expression, suggesting that they possess similar cellular functions in diverse species.34,35,71 Our genome-wide analysis of the spatio-temporal expression patterns of S. scrofa circRNAs provides a foundation for studies aimed at understanding the molecular functions of mammalian circRNAs.Thousands of circRNAs have been discovered in plants, animals, and humans. Given the emerging understanding of the biological importance of circRNAs and research efforts to understand them, researchers have constructed several circRNA databases, including Circ2Traits,72 CircNet,61 deepBase v2.0,73 CircInteractome,74 and SomamiR2.0.75 At present, these databases include human, mouse, and C. elegans circRNAs, but not S. scrofa circRNAs, because identification of circRNAs in pigs has lagged far behind identification of circRNAs in humans, mice, and C. elegans. Exploring the pig genome can illuminate facets of human culture, organic evolution, biomedical research, and animal breeding. Therefore, we constructed the database of S. scrofa circRNAs based on our data. To the best of our knowledge, this database is the first public resource containing information about the circRNAs of a non-rodent mammal.AvailabilityRNA-seq data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession codes was GSE73763.

IntroductionElucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying genome functions, such as transcription, requires identification of molecules that interact with the genomic regions of interest. To this end, several biochemical methods have been developed. For example, proteomics of isolated chromatin (PICh) utilizes oligonucleotide probes to capture target loci for identification of associated proteins.1 We developed locus-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (locus-specific ChIP) technologies [see review2–4]. By combining locus-specific ChIP with downstream biochemical analyses, one can identify molecules that physically interact with target genomic regions in cells in a locus-specific manner.In principle, locus-specific ChIP consists of locus-tagging and affinity purification. On the basis of various strategies for locus-tagging, we developed two locus-specific ChIP technologies, insertional ChIP (iChIP)5,6 and engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated ChIP (enChIP).7,8 iChIP utilizes an exogenous DNA-binding protein, such as a bacterial protein LexA, and its binding element for locus-tagging, whereas enChIP employs engineered DNA-binding molecules, such as transcription activator-like (TAL) proteins9,10 and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system,11,12 for the same purpose. After isolation of tagged loci by affinity purification, their interacting molecules can be comprehensively identified by downstream analyses including mass spectrometry (MS), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and microarrays. In fact, we have successfully identified proteins that interact with target loci by iChIP or enChIP in combination with MS, including a quantitative form of MS, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (iChIP/enChIP-MS or -SILAC).7,8,13–15 In addition, identification of chromatin-binding RNAs is also feasible using enChIP in combination with RT-PCR (enChIP-RT-PCR) or RNA sequencing (enChIP-RNA-Seq).8,16 Locus-specific ChIP has been used by other researchers.17,18 Several years after our initial publications of iChIP, essentially identical methods have been reported by other groups.19–21 In addition, after our initial publication of enChIP, a method essentially identical with enChIP using a TAL protein has been reported.22Genome functions are mediated by chromosomal interactions (e.g. interactions between enhancers and promoters). To detect physical chromosomal interactions, several techniques have been utilized to date, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)23 and chromosome conformation capture (3C) plus 3C-derived methods.24–28 In this regard, locus-specific ChIP can also be applied to detection of physical chromosomal interactions (one-to-many interactions). In fact, using iChIP in combination with microarrays (iChIP-microarray), McCullagh et al. succeeded in non-biased identification of genomic regions that interact with a target locus in yeast.17 More recently, we showed that it is also feasible to analyze physical chromosomal interactions using enChIP combined with NGS analysis (enChIP-Seq).29The Pax5 gene encodes a transcription factor essential for B cell lineage commitment.30 Disruption of the Pax5 gene inhibits B cell differentiation,31,32 and Pax5-deficient B cells can be trans-differentiated into other lymphoid cell types in mice.33–35 To obtain mechanistic insight into transcriptional regulation of the Pax5 gene, we previously used iChIP-SILAC to identify proteins that interact with the Pax5 promoter region in the chicken B cell line DT40.15 However, the mechanisms underlying regulation of Pax5 transcription by chromosomal interactions remain incompletely understood. Although intron 5 of the mouse Pax5 gene contains enhancers essential for transcription of the gene,36 it remains unclear whether similar regulatory mechanisms exist across species. In this regard, because the DNA sequences of Pax5 intron 5 are scarcely conserved between mouse and chicken, it is possible that transcription of Pax5 is controlled in a species-specific manner.In this study, we applied iChIP in combination with NGS analysis (iChIP-Seq) to direct identification of genomic regions that interact with the Pax5 promoter region in DT40 cells. Some of the detected chromosomal interactions were independently confirmed by an updated form of enChIP-Seq. In addition, deletion of a B cell-specific interacting genomic region significantly decreased Pax5 transcription in DT40 cells, suggesting that the deleted region is an enhancer and that Pax5 transcription is regulated through chromosomal interactions between this enhancer and the promoter in a B cell-specific manner. Thus, locus-specific ChIP in combination with NGS analysis revealed a mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the chicken Pax5 gene.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell cultureDT40, Non-KI(B), KI(B), and KI(MF) were maintained as described previously.152.2. iChIP-Seq, in vitro enChIP-Seq, and bioinformatics analysisNon-KI(B), KI(B), and KI(MF) (2 × 107 each) were subjected to the iChIP procedure as described previously.15 DT40 was subjected to the in vitro enChIP procedure as described previously.37 The complex of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targeting the Pax5 promoter and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) was used as Pax5 gRNA for in vitro enChIP. The gRNA sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Briefly, after fragmentation of chromatin DNA (the average length of fragments was about 2 kbp), the target region was isolated by iChIP or in vitro enChIP. After purification of DNA, DNA libraries were prepared using TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep Kit (Illumina); in this preparation step, DNA fragments around 0.4 kbp in length were selectively concentrated. The libraries were subjected to DNA sequencing using the HiSeq platform according to the manufacturer’s protocol. NGS and data analysis were performed as described previously.38,39 Additional information on NGS analysis is provided in Supplementary Table S2. NGS data were mapped onto the reference genome galGal4 using ELAND (Illumina). Narrow peaks of each iChIP-Seq dataset (see Steps 1 and 2 in Fig. 2) were detected using Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq 2 (MACS2, http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/ (14 May 2017, date last accessed)) with default parameters. Images of NGS peaks were generated using Integrative Genomics Veiwer (IGV) (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/ (14 May 2017, date last accessed)). The accession number of the NGS data is DRA005236.2.3. PlasmidsThe Cas9 expression plasmid (Addgene #41815)40 and chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression plasmid (Addgene #41824)40 were provided by Dr. George Church through Addgene. For construction of the sgRNA expression plasmids, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) encoding the target sequences were cloned downstream of the U6 promoter in the sgRNA expression plasmid. Alternatively, DNA fragments coding the U6 promoter, target sequence, gRNA scaffold, and termination signal were synthesized and cloned in plasmids by GeneArt gene synthesis services (Thermo Fisher Scientific).2.4. Deletion of genomic loci by CRISPR-mediated genome editingDT40 cells (1 × 107) were transfected with a Cas9 expression plasmid (120 µg), sgRNA expression plasmids (120 µg) targeting each end of a target genomic region, and pEGFP-N3 (0.3 µg, Clontech) by electroporation using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 950 µF. One day later, GFP-positive cells were sorted and expanded individually. To confirm targeted locus deletion, genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to genotyping PCR with KOD FX (Toyobo). PCR cycles were as follows: heating at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. Primers used for genotyping PCR are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.5. RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCRExtraction of total RNA and quantitative RT-PCR were performed as described previously.41 Primers used in this experiment are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.6. ChIP assaysAntibodies against H3K4me1 (39298, Active Motif), H3K27ac (39134, Active Motif), and histone H3 (MABI0301, Wako) were used. ChIP assays were performed with DT40 cells (2 × 106) and each antibody (3.5 µl for H3K4me1 or 2 µg for the others) as described previously.13 DNA purified using ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research) was used as template for real-time PCR with SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. Primers used in this experiment are shown in Supplementary Table S1.3. Results and discussion3.1. Scheme of iChIP-Seq for analysis of chromosomal interactions around the Pax5 promoter regionThe scheme of iChIP-Seq used in this study is as follows (Fig. 1A): (I) Using homologous recombination, binding elements of the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA (LexA BE) were inserted ~0.3 kb upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) of the Pax5 exon 1A in chromosome Z of DT40 cells. (II) 3xFNLDD, which consists of 3xFLAG-tag, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and LexA DNA-binding and dimerization domains, was expressed in the cells established in Step (I). (III) The resultant cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde and lysed, and chromatin DNA was fragmented by sonication. (IV) The tagged locus (the Pax5 promoter region) was affinity-purified using an anti-FLAG antibody. (V) After reverse crosslinking and DNA purification, genomic regions interacting with the Pax5 promoter region were identified by NGS analysis. iChIP-Seq for identification of genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter in chicken B cells. (A) A schematic diagram of iChIP-Seq in this study. First, LexA-binding elements (LexA BE) were inserted into the Pax5 promoter region, and 3xFNLDD [a fusion protein of the 3xFLAG-tag, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and LexA DNA-binding domain plus dimerization domain] was expressed in DT40. After crosslinking with formaldehyde, chromatin DNA was fragmented by sonication, and the target locus was affinity-purified with anti-FLAG antibody. After reversal of crosslinking, DNA was purified and subjected to NGS analysis. (B) The chicken B cell line DT40 and its derivatives used for iChIP-Seq.

NGS data from iChIP-Seq were visualized in IGV. The vertical viewing range (y-axis shown as scale) was set to 0–200 based on the magnitude of the noise peaks.In this study, we utilized DT40-derived cell lines (Fig. 1B), which were previously established for iChIP-SILAC analysis of the Pax5 promoter region;15 Non-KI(B) is DT40 expressing 3xFNLDD, and KI(B) is a DT40-derived cell line harboring an insertion of LexA BE in the Pax5 promoter region and expressing 3xFNLDD. In our previous study, insertion of LexA BE and expression of 3xFNLDD did not disturb transcription of the endogenous Pax5 gene,15 suggesting that the regulatory machinery involved for Pax5 transcription is retained in both Non-KI(B) and KI(B). In addition, we previously showed that the Pax5 promoter region can be efficiently isolated from KI(B) by iChIP (~10% of input as DNA yields).15 Following the experimental scheme (Fig. 1A), we isolated the Pax5 promoter region by iChIP and subjected the purified DNA samples to NGS analysis using HiSeq. NGS reads corresponding to the Pax5 promoter region were clearly enriched when iChIP was performed with KI(B) but not Non-KI(B) [iChIP(#1) in Fig. 1C]. A biological replicate of the iChIP-Seq analysis showed similar results [iChIP(#2) in Fig. 1C]. These results demonstrated efficient isolation of the Pax5 promoter region by iChIP.3.2. Detection of genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter region in DT40Next, we proceeded to identify the genomic regions that interact with the Pax5 promoter region in DT40 (Fig. 2). Because 3xFNLDD might interact with endogenous DNA sequences, similar to the recognition sequence of LexA (CTGTN8ACAG)42 in the DT40 genome, iChIP-Seq data obtained from Non-KI(B) were used to eliminate genomic regions detected due to such off-target binding (Step 1 in Fig. 2). We identified 2,383 peak positions with read numbers more than 2-fold higher in KI(B) than in Non-KI(B), and considered these as potential interacting genomic regions. Because the top 5% peaks (119 peaks) had >7-fold enrichment (Step 1 in Fig. 2), we arbitrarily set 7-fold as the threshold for extraction of genomic regions that interact with the Pax5 promoter region with high frequency. As shown in Step 2 in Figure 2, 105 peaks passed this criterion (>7-fold), from among 2,325 peaks (>2-fold) in the biological replicate. Comparing the 119 (Step 1) and 105 (Step 2) peaks, we identified 34 peaks as reproducibly passing the criterion (Step 3 in Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S1, and Supplementary Table S3). In this regard, 90 out of the 119 peaks (75.6%) in Data set #1 (>7-fold) were detected in the 2,325 peaks in Data set #2 (>2-fold), and 62 out of the 105 peaks (59.0%) in Data set #2 (>7-fold) were detected in the 2,383 peaks in Data set #1 (>2-fold) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, more than about 60% of the peaks that passed the criterion ‘>7-fold’ were reproducibly detected. Extraction of genomic regions interacting with the Pax5 promoter region in DT40. (Step 1) Removal of off-target binding sites. iChIP-Seq data were compared between KI(B) and Non-KI(B) (negative control) using Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) to eliminate off-target binding sites. (Step 2) Analysis of another biological replicate of Step 1. (Step 3) Identification of genomic regions that interact with the Pax5 promoter region. The genomic regions commonly detected in Steps 1 and 2 represent candidate genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter region.Extraction of genomic regions interacting with the Pax5 promoter region in DT40.

(Step 2) Analysis of another biological replicate of Step 1. (Step 3) Identification of genomic regions that interact with the Pax5 promoter region. The genomic regions commonly detected in Steps 1 and 2 represent candidate genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter region.Among the 34 peaks, 1 peak was the LexA BE-inserted Pax5 promoter region (Supplementary Table S3) and the other 33 were considered as candidate genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter region. Pax5 intron 5 was not detected as the candidates (Supplementary Table S3), although intron 5 of the mouse Pax5 gene contains enhancers essential for transcription of the gene.36 In this study, we filtered iChIP-Seq data on the basis of the criterion ‘>7-fold’ to extract genomic regions that bind to the Pax5 promoter region with high frequency. In this regard, more permissive criteria would increase the number of potentially interacting genomic regions. In fact, the criterion ‘more than 2-fold’ extracted 680 common peaks between the 2,383 peaks (Step 1) and 2,325 peaks (Step 2). However, in this case, it might be more difficult to confidently evaluate whether the detected peaks reflect physiological interactions or noise. Therefore, hereafter we focused on the 33 peaks passing the more stringent criterion.3.3. Confirmation of physical chromosomal interactions by in vitro enChIPThe chromosomal interactions identified by iChIP-Seq (Fig. 2) could include artificial ones caused by insertion of LexA BE. Therefore, it was necessary to confirm the identified chromosomal interactions by another independent method in intact DT40 cells. To this end, we attempted to utilize in vitro enChIP, an updated form of conventional enChIP.37,43 In in vitro enChIP, recombinant molecules [e.g. recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs)] are used for in vitro locus-tagging rather than in cell locus-tagging (Fig. 3A). Because intact cells can be utilized in this in vitro system, it is unnecessary to consider disruption of physiological chromosomal conformation and potential side-effects caused by in cell locus-tagging. In in vitro enChIP using CRISPR RNPs (Fig. 3A), chromosomal conformation in intact DT40 was fixed by formaldehyde crosslinking, and chromatin DNA was fragmented by sonication. The Pax5 promoter was captured by CRISPR RNPs and isolated from a mixture of the fragmented chromatin by affinity purification. NGS analysis of the isolated material then revealed the genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter. In vitro enChIP-Seq for confirmation of the results of iChIP-Seq. (A) Intact DT40 cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde, and chromatin DNA was fragmented by sonication. Recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which consist of 3xFLAG-dCas9-Dock and gRNA targeting the Pax5 promoter region, were mixed with the fragmented chromatin DNA to capture the target region. After affinity purification with anti-FLAG antibody, reversal of crosslinking, and DNA purification, the DNA was subjected to NGS analysis. (B) Target position of Pax5 gRNA.

The peak positions identified by iChIP-Seq were confirmed by in vitro enChIP-Seq in IGV.We designed a guide RNA (Pax5 gRNA) recognizing a 23 bp target site that is 0.1 kb upstream from the TSS of the Pax5 exon 1A (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S2); the recognized DNA sequence exists only in the target site, i.e. nowhere else in the chicken genome. We performed in vitro enChIP with Pax5 gRNA to specifically isolate the Pax5 promoter region from intact DT40. Isolation of the Pax5 promoter region was confirmed by NGS analysis (in vitro enChIP-Seq) (Fig. 3C) and PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we examined whether the 33 peaks identified by iChIP-Seq (Step 3 in Fig. 2) were also observed by in vitro enChIP-Seq (Fig. 3D). Based on visual confirmation in IGV, a high-performance visualization tool, approximately half of the peaks (14 peaks) were also observed by in vitro enChIP-Seq in the presence of Pax5 gRNA but not in the absence of gRNA (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3); representative results are shown in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4. CRISPR binds to DNA sequences similar to the target sequence, a phenomenon known as off-target binding.44–47 However, potential off-target binding sites were not found in the 14 identified genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. S5). Thus, the genomic regions independently confirmed by in vitro enChIP-Seq (Table 1) can be considered as those that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter region in DT40 cells. These results show that, in addition to iChIP-microarray,17 iChIP-Seq would be a useful tool for non-biased identification of physical chromosomal interactions.

The same loci in the iChIP-Seq data [#1, Non-KI(B) and KI(B)] are shown in Supplementary Figure S3.Intra-chromosomal interactions would be more frequently observed than inter-chromosomal interactions by 3C-based techniques.48 Although we detected intra-chromosomal interactions using the criterion ‘>2-fold’, percentages of intra-chromosomal interactions were not necessarily high (Supplementary Fig. S6). One of the causes of this may be that sonication was used for fragmentation of chromatin, whereas milder enzymatic digestion is usually used in 3C-based techniques. In fact, it has been reported that 4C-Seq using enzymatic digestion detected intra-chromosomal interactions much more frequently than 4C-Seq using sonication-based fragmentation.49 In addition, it has been reported that sonication weakens the signals detected by 3C using enzymatic digestion.50,51 Neighboring loci in the same chromosome would be spatially proximal each other in a chromosomal compartment. Weak chromosomal interactions such as random (non-specific) collision in the compartment would not be disrupted by gentle restriction enzyme digestion and detected much more frequently as intra-chromosomal interactions by 3C-based technologies using enzymatic digestion. By contrast, such weak interactions and chromosomal compartments could be disrupted by sonication.50,52 Strong chromosomal interactions mediated by specific mediators could be retained even under fragmentation by sonication. Thus, sonication method used for fragmentation of chromatin in our analyses may disrupt such weak intra-chromosomal interactions.Interestingly, most of the identified genomic regions were localized in chromosome 21 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3). Because those regions were spread equally in chromosome 21 (Supplementary Fig. S7), the entire chromosome 21 might interact with the Pax5 gene (or chromosome Z on which the Pax5 gene is located) in the nucleus of DT40 cells. On the other hand, some peaks identified by iChIP-Seq were not confirmed by in vitro enChIP-Seq. In this regard, insertion of LexA BE might partially change the chromosomal conformation around the insertion site and organize artificial chromosomal interactions, which would not be confirmed in intact DT40 by in vitro enChIP. Alternatively, in vitro enChIP might fail to confirm some bona fide chromosomal interactions identified by iChIP-Seq. Because the insertion site of LexA BE is 0.2 kb upstream from the target site of the Pax5 gRNA (Supplementary Fig. S8), iChIP can capture chromosomal interactions organized in the more upstream region of the Pax5 promoter, whereas in vitro enChIP might fail to confirm such chromosomal interactions.3.4. Identification of genomic regions that physically interact with the Pax5 promoter region in a B cell-specific mannerThe chromosomal interactions identified above might be organized in a B cell-specific manner or occur constitutively in different cell types. Therefore, we next examined whether the 14 interacting genomic regions (Table 1) could be detected in NGS data of iChIP-Seq of KI(MF), which is KI(B) trans-differentiated into a macrophage-like cell by expression of chicken C/EBPß.15 KI(MF) expresses M-CSFR, a macrophage marker, but neither Pax5 nor AID, another B cell marker (Fig. 5A).15 As shown in Figure 5B, the Pax5 promoter region was isolated from KI(MF) by iChIP. Visual comparison in IGV revealed that three peaks in chromosome 11 and three peaks in chromosome 21 (total six peaks) were observed in a B cell-specific manner, whereas the other eight peaks were constitutively observed both in the B cell and the macrophage-like cell lines (Fig. 5C, Table 1); the three B cell specific peaks in chromosome 11 and two constitutive peaks in chromosome 21 are shown as representatives in Figure 5D–F and Supplementary Figure S9, respectively. Thus, by comparing iChIP-Seq data, we were able to identify genomic regions that interact with the Pax5 promoter region in a B cell-specific manner.

The images from iChIP-Seq (#2) in Figure 4A–C are also shown here for comparison with those from iChIP-Seq of KI(MF).We also attempted in vitro enChIP-Seq with the macrophage-like cell line DT40(MF), which is DT40 trans-differentiated into a macrophage-like cell by ectopic expression of chicken C/EBPß (Supplementary Fig. S10A–C). However, in vitro enChIP with Pax5 gRNA failed to isolate the Pax5 promoter region from DT40(MF) (Supplementary Fig. S10D), suggesting that the CRISPR RNP was unable to access the gRNA target site. Because Pax5 transcription is silenced in DT40(MF) (Supplementary Fig. S10B), the Pax5 promoter might be heterochromatinized. Alternatively, effector molecules, such as transcriptional repressors, might occupy the gRNA target site, which would block access by the CRISPR RNP.3.5. Regulation of expression of Pax5 by a physical interaction between genomic regionsThe identified genomic regions (Table 1) might include transcriptional regulatory regions that control Pax5 transcription through chromosomal interactions. To examine this possibility, we used CRISPR-mediated genome editing to delete genomic regions that B cell-specifically interacted with the Pax5 promoter region.11,12 We chose the three regions in chromosome 11 for locus deletion because they are within 100 kb of each other, and it was therefore feasible to delete all of them at once (Fig. 6A), and two of those regions are highly ranked in Table 1. We refer to these three regions (Chr11: 8,547,569–8,551,932; Chr11: 8,566,135–8,576,125; and Chr11: 8,646,187–8,648,734) as Interacting Region in Chromosome 11 No. 1 (IRC11-1), IRC11-2, and IRC11-3, respectively (Table 1). We constructed plasmids for expression of sgRNAs targeting each end of those genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. S11A–C) and co-transfected them with a Cas9 expression plasmid to delete the target genomic regions (Supplementary Fig. S11). We were able to delete all three regions (100 kb) in one allele in DT40 (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Figs S11D and S12). In the resultant cells (Clone 100k), the transcript levels of the Pax5 gene were not changed (Fig. 6C and D). Next, we deleted each interacting genomic region (IRC11-1, IRC11-2, or IRC11-3) in the other allele in Clone 100k (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Figs S11D and S12). Additional deletion of IRC11-2 or IRC11-3 did not have any effects on Pax5 transcription, whereas deletion of IRC11-1 moderately but significantly decreased transcription of Pax5 (Fig. 6C and D). In DT40, Pax5 was transcribed comparably from the exons 1A and 1B.53 Deletion of IRC11-1 decreased transcription from the exon 1A, but not 1B (Fig. 6C and D). To further confirm the physiological importance of IRC11-1 for Pax5 transcription, we deleted only this region from both alleles in DT40 (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Figs S11E and S12). The resultant cells (Clone IRC11-1) also exhibited reduced Pax5 transcription from the exon 1A (Fig. 6C and D). Thus, the decrease in levels of Pax5 transcription in two independently established cell lines (Clone 100k_IRC11-1 and Clone IRC11-1) suggested that IRC11-1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of the Pax5 gene, acting as an enhancer via inter-chromosomal interaction. A genomic region interacting with the Pax5 promoter is involved in transcriptional regulation of the Pax5 gene.

Because two peaks were observed in IRC11-1 by iChIP-Seq analyses (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3A), we examined these histone modifications at both positions. ChIP assays clearly showed that these histone modifications were enriched at both positions in IRC11-1 but not in an irrelevant genomic region in chromosome 2 (Fig. 7), suggesting that IRC11-1 functions as a distal enhancer for Pax5 transcription. Enrichment of the active enhancer marks was also observed in IRC11-3, whereas only H3K4me1 was enriched in IRC11-2 (Fig. 7). Therefore, IRC11-3 might be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes other than Pax5. Enrichment of active enhancer marks on the identified genomic regions.

Because chromosome Z, which contains Pax5, is a single-copy chromosome in DT40,58,59 IRC11-1 in each allele may be sufficient for transcription of the single-copy Pax5 gene. In addition, deletion of IRC11-1 significantly but only partially down-regulated Pax5 transcription, suggesting that it plays a limited role in Pax5 transcription. In IRC11-1, two sub-regions, which are marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, interacted strongly with the Pax5 promoter (two peak positions in Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3A), suggesting that each sub-region might work independently or collaboratively to regulate Pax5 transcription from the exon 1A. On the other hand, we cannot exclude a possibility that IRC11-1 might indirectly control transcription of the Pax5 gene through regulation of transcription of other genes. In this context, it might be possible that IRC11-1 interacts with promoters of other genes for regulation of their transcription. Deletion of IRC11-1 might affect transcription of those genes, which might result in suppression of Pax5 transcription through alteration of multiple signaling pathways. Future work should seek to elucidate the mechanistic details underlying transcriptional regulation of Pax5 by IRC11-1.4. Conclusions and perspectivesIn this study, we identified physical chromosomal interactions between the Pax5 promoter and other genomic regions by locus-specific ChIP in combination with NGS analysis. iChIP-Seq and in vitro enChIP-Seq revealed that the Pax5 promoter binds to multiple genomic regions, in which most regions are localized in chromosome 21 (Figs 1–4). Some of these interactions were organized in a B cell-specific manner (Fig. 5). In addition, we showed that deletion of an interacting genomic region in chromosome 11, which is marked by active enhancer histone modifications, decreased transcriptional levels of the Pax5 gene (Figs 6 and 7), suggesting its physiological involvement in transcriptional regulation of the Pax5 gene. To our knowledge, this study is the first report to reveal physical chromosomal interactions focusing on the Pax5 gene and a regulation mechanism of Pax5 transcription through B cell-specific inter-chromosomal interaction (Fig. 7C). In this study, we used the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model B cell. It would be an interesting future study to examine whether these chromosomal interactions play any roles in Pax5 transcription in different species.Our results also indicate that locus-specific ChIP in combination with NGS analysis is a useful tool for performing non-biased searches for physical chromosomal interactions (one-to-many interactions). Thus, this technology could facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of genome functions, including transcription.Several methods have been utilized for detection of genome-wide chromosomal interaction. However, observation by only a single method might not accurately reflect physiological chromosomal interactions. In this regard, potential discrepancies have been reported between the results of FISH and those of 3C or its derivatives.60 Therefore, in analysis of chromosomal interactions, it may be necessary to combine several independent methods to eliminate potential contamination of artifactual signals. In this regard, iChIP-Seq (and in vitro enChIP-Seq) could be used as one of several methods. In this study, we used in vitro enChIP-Seq just to confirm the results of iChIP-Seq. We believe that in vitro enChIP is potentially useful for identification of chromosomal interactions. However, to make the claim of utility of this technology stronger, more analyses using other gRNAs (e.g. more than two gRNAs targeting one target locus or other transcribed genes as controls) should be necessary. Nevertheless, considering its convenience, in vitro enChIP-Seq may be preferable for future identification of chromosomal interactions.Data availabilityThe accession number of the NGS data is DRA005236 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=DRA005236 (12 May 2017, date last accessed)).We thank G.M.

IntroductionMeiotic recombination plays a vital role in sexual reproduction by mixing parental alleles to create novel allele combinations. In general, both genetic mapping and traditional breeding depends upon the distribution of recombination along chromosomes. In plants, the meiotic recombination rate is tightly regulated within the genome, but varies between species.1 Furthermore, the distribution of recombination events is not random along the chromosome. Regions that are preferred and suppressed for recombination are known as recombination hotspots and coldspots, respectively. Various studies have shown that recombination prone regions vary in size and magnitude between species (Zea mays,2,3,Triticum aestivum,4,Arabidopsis thaliana5,6 and Medicago trancatula7). Extended knowledge about genome-wide recombination patterns in a species would not only improve the understanding of recombination preferences but also accelerate fine mapping of genetic traits and breeding design of the crop. Moreover, high-resolution recombination patterns provide the opportunity to study recombination associated genomic features, thereby the possibility to modulate recombination to accelerate breeding.Advancement in sequencing technology has not only enabled rapid generation of draft genome assemblies for individual species but also identification of genome-wide ultra-dense markers in a population. Hence, whole genome resequencing has also enabled high resolution recombination pattern identification. Recent studies have produced base pair resolution recombination patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana and shown that the distribution of recombination is influenced by chromatin structure, histone variants and DNA methylation, among other factors.8,9 Further analysis using next generation resequencing data revealed poly-A, CCN-repeat and CTT-repeat motifs associated with recombination prone regions in Arabidopsis thaliana.5,8,10 The first motif was associated with nucleosome depleted regions, whereas CCN- and CTT-repeat motifs were enriched within genes.10,11 However, lack of stringent resequencing data analysis led to false positive markers that inflate recombination rate.12 Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to select an accurate marker-set while applying resequencing data for recombination identification.5,13 This caveat is even bigger in crops with a large genome, or the ones possessing a high repeat content. Besides, an incomplete assembled reference genome representing only one haploid genome may hamper proper evaluation of recombination rates. Therefore, in crop plants, it is crucial to have a cost effective methodology that can identify genome-wide recombination patterns using low-coverage resequencing data. This is desired to reduce sequencing efforts to a minimum and at the same time maintain a low false-positive identification rate. In this study, we describe a novel methodology using meticulous filtering steps to conservatively select polymorphic markers from low-coverage resequencing population data to identify recombination sites. We applied our method to identify genome-wide recombination pattern on resequencing data from 60 tomato recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from an interspecific cross between Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker and Solanum pimpinellifolium CGN 15528.In crop plants, tomato is a model species for fruit developmental studies and interspecific crosses are primarily used for genetic mapping. S. pimpinellifolium, a wild but closely related species of S. lycopersicum, is a source for introgression breeding including various disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, and fruit quality improvements.14–18 However, these interspecific crosses usually cause recombination suppression within the introgression region and require extensive additional breeding efforts for later improvements. For example, the tomato chromosomes 6 and 9 are known to contain introgression fragments for nematode and TMV resistance and conceive low or no recombination.19–21 Despite the utility of local recombination pattern for an informed breeding design, there is no availability of genome-wide high-resolution interspecific recombination pattern in tomato. This is mainly due to the complexity and lack of methodology to apply resequencing to a relatively large genome for genome-wide recombination pattern identification. Like the majority of crop species, the tomato genome sequence is complex and incomplete. Current tomato reference genome has assembled 760 mega base pair (Mbp) from an estimated genome size of 900 Mbp.22 This hinders the use of a resequencing approach for genome-wide recombination studies. Moreover, structural variations are reported between S. lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium, which impede the analysis of interspecific genomes even further.23In this study, we applied our novel methodology to identify a reliable set of polymorphic markers from the resequencing data from an interspecific RIL population. By using allele segregation in the population and resequencing data from one of the parents, we inferred the genotype of the second parent and estimated haplotypes for 60 RILs to identify recombination sites. We identified high-resolution genome-wide recombination patterns and identified several DNA motifs enriched at recombination prone regions, including two AT-rich motifs, which have not been reported previously in relation with recombination in plants. With this study, we have identified high-resolution recombination prone regions in tomato and genomic features associated with it.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data used and variant callingWe used low-coverage (~6.3×) Illumina HiSeq 2000 resequencing data of 60 RILs (Supplementary Table S1). This F6 population was generated by an interspecific cross between S. lycopersicum (cv. Moneymaker) and S. pimpinellifolium (CGN 15528, also referred to as CGN 14498).24 Resequencing data from one of the parents, S. lycopersicum, was publicly available with an average genome coverage of ~38×, whereas the sequencing data for S. pimpinellifolium was unavailable. Both RILs and S. lycopersicum were part of the 150 tomato Genome Resequencing Project (http://www.tomatogenome.net/).24 We aligned the short reads from 60 RILs and S. lycopersicum separately to S. lycopersicum cv. Heinz 1706 reference genome (version Sl2.40, http://www.solgenomics.net) using a modified version of BWA (based on version 0.5.9.) default settings.25 For each sample read groups were corrected and duplicate reads were removed using PICARD tools (version 1.107, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) with default settings. We improved the alignment by local realignment using GATK-lite (version 2.39) and these improved aligned resequencing data were subjected to variant calling by the UnifiedGenotyper of GATK-lite default settings.262.2. Population based marker-set identificationAfter variant calling, we strictly filtered single nucleotide variants (SNPs). To consider a genomic position a genuine marker, in contrast to sequencing and read alignment artefacts, characteristics of a SNP were needed to meet six criteria. There parameters were chosen based on the expected characteristics of the used RIL population.By making sure that the same marker is reported in multiple plants, we made use of the recurrence of SNP information and took advantage of population’s properties. Although it was expected to have approximately 30 homozygous alternative allele calls on a position, we incorporated a substantial margin to account for missing calls due to the low coverage data used and variation in the uniformity of the expected segregation pattern, considering the limited size of the population. For this study, at least 10 out of 60 RILs were required to report a homozygous alternative call on a single position.Since the population is expected to be mostly homozygous, heterozygous SNPs have a higher chance of being either sequencing or read alignment artefacts. At the same time, it is harder to call heterozygous genotypes than it is to call homozygous genotypes in low coverage sequencing data. Therefore, we also required that the ratio of homozygous calls to the total number of calls had to be above 0.8. This way we avoided the selection of positions that were susceptible to show heterozygous genotypes throughout the majority of the population, which might for example have been caused by misaligned reads or paralogous sequences in the genome.Meanwhile, the ratio of alternative calls to the total number of homozygous can assure the selection of markers that are evenly segregating through the population. This ratio is expected to be equal between alternative and reference calls. However, this ratio is heavily influenced by the number of plants having, or missing, a genotype call on the respective position, which is expected to vary due to sequencing coverage. So, considering the limited population size and the amount of missing genotype calls, the ratio of alternative homozygous calls and total number of homozygous calls was set to be between 0.25 and 0.75. This was especially important in this particular study, because we were not only constructing a marker-set but also inferring the genotypes of the second parent. By confirming that both reference and alternative allele were segregating within the population, we confirmed that the parents have opposite genotypes on this position.To correct for individual sequencing artefacts, only biallelic SNPs with a coverage of four or more for at least one of the alleles were considered. In total we yielded 4,463,846 markers after filtering and these markers were used for genotyping. A correlation between the abundance of available markers and the average coverage of a RIL was expected. The number of available markers and coverage per plant were visualized to estimate the strength of the expected correlation.2.3. Inferring markers of second parentSince resequencing data for S. pimpinellifolium was not available, we inferred the S. pimpinellifolium genotypes by assigning non-S. lycopersicum allele to previously identified population based markers. Markers with reference base calls reported in the S. lycopersicum accession were considered to have alternative base in S. pimpinellifolium. Out of 4,463,846 markers, 75,526 were inferred to be alternative base in S. lycopersicum and consequently reference base in S. pimpinellifolium. S. lycopersicum was expected to have less alternative base calls, because it is more closely related to the used reference genome as opposed to S. pimpinellifolium.24 Using 130 Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays,27 we validated the inferred genotype of S. pimpinellifolium and estimated its accuracy.2.4. Determining haplotype blocks and estimating recombination landscapeA variable sliding window approach was used to impute the haplotype blocks of RILs. Imputation of haplotypes enabled us to resolve conflicting genotypes as a result of erroneous parental markers, sequencing errors and read alignment artefacts. The used variable window was adjusted in size to the local density of available markers, with at least nine markers over a genomic distance of at least 10 kbp. Scoring markers in a variable window allowed the collective use of markers, correcting faulty individual markers and genotypes.The use of a variable window also contributed to cope with missing markers due to low-coverage resequencing, without compromising the yielded resolution. The score of a window was calculated by adding up all genotypes (+1 for S. lycopersicum, 0 for heterozygous, -1 for S. pimpinellifolium) and dividing it by the number of markers in the window. When 50% or more of the markers in a window were heterozygous, the window was given an intermediate score of 0 (Supplementary Fig. S1: second panel).Each time the score of a forthcoming window (w) passed one of the thresholds w > 0.25, -0.25 < = w < = 0.25 or w < -0.25 in respect to the previous window, the markers of both windows were merged and subjected to a second analysis. This was done to avoid false positive recombination events due to fluctuation in scores, caused by sequencing and read alignment artefacts. Again a variable window approach was used, but over a greater distance of at least 250kbp with 50 markers both upwards and downwards of the presumed recombination region. This confirmed whether variation in scores was persistent, thus must have been caused by a recombination event. Finally, the inner unambiguous markers with contrasting parental genotypes were selected as borders of the recombination event.When two or more haplotype changes were detected within 250kbp, this was considered to be most likely the result of fluctuation in scores caused by artefacts. In such cases, all involved events were merged and processed as a single event, which may or may not have resulted in the detection of a genuine recombination event. Our tool reports all the recombination sites per individual as well as the summarised recombination pattern per chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S1, first panel). This intermediate score and recombination landscape were visualised to ease manual inspection and optimization of the parameters described in “Population based marker-set identification” (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the population of 60 RILs, we calculated the average number of recombination per chromosome by considering all marker positions within the chromosome conceived with at least one recombination. The background recombination rate per chromosome was calculated by adding average recombination rate with one standard deviation. Regions having a recombination rate above the background rate were considered as recombination prone regions. The longest region of each chromosome without any recombination over all 60 RILs was considered recombination deprived region.2.5. False-positive recombination events caused by the used reference genome assemblyTwo versions (Sl2.40 and Sl2.50) of the S. lycopersicum cv. Heinz 1706 reference genome assembly were aligned to detect large inversions and relocations between the two reference genomes using MUMmer3’s NUCmer.28 For this, a minimum cluster size of 1kbp and all anchor matches regardless of their uniqueness were used. Large scale differences in alignment between these two reference assemblies indicated inconsistencies between assemblies. These differences were used to eliminate recombination prone regions overlapping with these regions to prevent false positives caused by the used assembly (version Sl2.40).2.6. Confirmation of inferred parental genotype and RIL haplotypesIn order to confirm both the inferred S. pimpinellifolium genotype and individual RIL haplotypes, we ordered the seeds of 60 RILs together with their corresponding parental lines from the 150 Tomato Project. The seeds were sown on wet tissue paper at 25 °C with a continuous exposure to light for 12 days. Due to poor seed germination, we proceeded with 55 RIL plants. Whole seedlings were harvested and outsourced to LGC Teddington, London, for genomic DNA extraction and KASP genotyping in duplo. Genotyping was done using LGC’s KASP Master Mix, containing two universal cassettes (FAM and HEX), ROXtm passive reference dye, Taq polymerase, free nucleotides and MgCl2 in an optimized buffer solution. One hundred and fifty SNPs were selected for KASP assay-design of which 90 SNPs around recombination prone regions, 20 random, 24 in removed regions and 16 to confirm suspected false positives were indeed caused by sequencing and read alignment artefacts (Supplementary Table S2). Selected SNPs were subjected to LGC’s Primer Picker software for an in silico examination of possible drop-outs prior to shipping.We used an ad-hoc script to compare LGC’s KASP genotypes with our predicted haplotype blocks for an exact match. Whenever one or both of the two KASP replicate assays had failed, or replicate assays did not match, the concerned assay was discarded in order to eliminate errors introduced by the used method of confirmation. This allowed us to validate polymorphic marker identification, as well as inferred genotypes of S. pimpinellifolium and our approach to estimate haplotype blocks for RILs.2.7. Discovery of DNA motifs enriched with recombination prone regionsIdentified recombination prone regions were assessed for over-representation of sequence motifs. Associated sequences were selected by our pipeline and subjected to de novo motif discovery by the MEME Suite.29 To include sequence motifs regulating recombination upstream and downstream of the processed recombination prone regions, sets with various sized flanking regions (0, 1, 2.5 and 5kbp) were created and subjected to motif discovery by MEME.30 The resulting collections of sequences had total sizes of 278kbp, 503kbp, 839kbp and 1,400kbp, respectively.MEME was used for de novo 8–15bp DNA sequence motif discovery at above-mentioned collection of sequences using a Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence model. The maximum allowed dataset size was increased to enable MEME to process the data. A control set of 1,000 random sequence collections was constructed, each containing 112 random S. lycopersicum cv. Heinz 1706 (reference version 2.40) sequences of lengths equal to the identified recombination prone regions together with their respective flanking regions. De novo discovered sequence motifs were analysed using default settings of AME31 and the control set, to determine whether these motifs were over-enriched in recombination prone region compared with the random background.2.8. Identification of genomic features associated with recombination prone regionsWe annotated each base pair of recombination prone regions to identify genomic features, including 5'-UTR, gene start, gene, 3'-UTR, gene end and intergenic region using the ITAG2.3 annotation (http://www.solgenomics.net). We defined promoter and gene start features as 3kbp reverse and 200bp forward from the transcription start site, respectively. Similarly, gene end was defined as 200bp before transcription end site. To assess whether the distance of recombination events to genes is significantly lower compared with randomly sampled positions, the genomic distance between all 112 regions and their nearest gene was mapped using the ITAG version 2.3 annotation. Two sets of 1000 random genomic regions were created with and without pericentric heterochromatin. These pericentric heterochromatins were discarded in one of the two sets to exclude influence due to their low gene density.32 Differences were visualized, showing the average of all randomly sampled positions in 1kbp windows, their corresponding standard deviation and observed distance to genes. We listed the annotated genes within the recombination prone regions for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the PANTHER classification system (http://www.geneontology.org/ (12 October 2016, date last accessed), which is up to date with GO annotations.33 We also compared genes overlapping with recombination prone regions to nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) resistance genes in tomato.343. Results3.1. Identification of population based marker-set from low-coverage resequencing dataGenotyping by resequencing allows identification of recombination break points at a high-resolution, but non-allelic structural variations between parental lines with a high homology in sequence can lead to false-positive markers, especially when using short-read resequencing data.5,13 Due to independent assortment of these loci, genotypes of these false positive markers will be random. Additionally, genotyping bias will increase if one of the parental lines is more closely related to the used reference genome. Together, these biases will produce false-positive markers and result in exaggerated recombination rates. Thus, it is crucial to filter out false-positive markers when estimating the recombination landscape, particularly while using low-coverage short-read resequencing data. We illustrated a novel methodology to conservatively select markers in the context to identify recombination sites by implementing fundamental population genetics principals with modifications to incorporate regions with low sequencing coverage.Short reads from individual RILs were aligned to tomato reference genome to identify SNPs using GATK-lite pipeline. To increase the specificity of SNP identification, we applied three rounds of filters, addressing the independent allele segregation within population, fixation or near fixation of alleles and sufficient sequencing depth at SNP position in individuals as well as within the population (see section Materials and methods). As shown in Fig. 1A–C, the characteristics of most markers corresponded to what was expected from a RIL population. The majority of markers were predominantly homozygous calls, with relatively few heterozygous calls (Fig. 1A). The ratio between homozygous calls and the combined number of both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes was near to one, confirming the homozygous nature of a RIL population (Fig. 1B). We examined the segregation of reference alleles and alternative alleles and identified that the majority of markers were located around a ratio of 0.5 as expected from a biparental population (Fig. 1C). Confirmation of these characteristics justifies the reasoning behind our filtering strategy. In total 4,463,846 out of 7,979,788 unique genomic positions with reported SNPs passed all filtering steps. Of these positions, on average 2,548,113 markers were available per individual in the low-coverage sequencing data, resulting in over 150 million available markers across the population. Despite stringent filtering, marker distribution was well spread across the genome allowing us to identify recombination patterns with high-resolution (Fig. 1D). The lowest and the highest number of markers for a single chromosome of an individual were 31,707 and 563,533, respectively. The average genome coverage per individual played a crucial role in the number of available markers and showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 (Fig. 2). Using the selected marker positions from the population, we used available parental genotype for haplotype phasing and inferred the missing parental genotype.

Estimated recombination rates and identified recombination prone regionsUsing a variable sliding window approach to identify genotype breaks, we identified 1,445 recombination events in 60 RIL tomato plants with 123 recombination prone regions (see section Materials and Methods, Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 and Fig. S2). We identified recombination events with a median track length of 2,134bp that is comparable to Arabidopsis thaliana.5 On an average, we identified 24 recombination events per RIL, which is in agreement with the expected number of observable recombinations.35During genotyping, three genomic regions were shown to be polymorphic for individual markers, but haplotypes of these genomic regions could not clearly be assigned to one of the parental genomes. As shown in previous studies, abnormalities in reference genome could lead to such patterns.5,13 Therefore, we removed recombination prone regions overlapping with these regions from further analysis. As a result, 0.32% of the markers were removed from further analysis. We further extended the above observation as large structural variation due to conflict in reference genome assembly, which can introduce false recombination events and consequently false recombination prone regions.23,36 We aligned the two most recent S. lycopersicum cv. Heinz 1706 reference genomes (Sl2.40 and Sl2.50) and identified large inversions and rearrangements on chromosome 1, 3 and 12 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Structural variation was also seen in other chromosomes, but these cases did not interfere with recombination events. In total, 11 recombination prone regions (two from chromosome 1 and all from chromosomes 3 and 12) were attributed to structural variation in the used reference genome. This reduced set of 112 recombination prone regions with a median of 1,204bp, making up a total size of 278,937bp was used for identification of genomic features. Because of differences in number of available markers, due to variance in sequence coverage, recombination site resolution varied between individuals. However, by utilizing the shared regions in the individually observed recombination events to define recombination prone regions allowed us to improve the resolution of these regions. These high-resolution recombination intervals in an interspecific tomato genome, allowed us to expand the knowledge of recombination patterns in tomato at a sequence level.The low number of recombinations per chromosome hampered fine resolution identification of recombination deprived regions. However, regions on all chromosomes without any recombination event at all were excessively large, ranging from 17.8 to 60.0Mbp (Supplementary Table S5). Recombination prone and deprived regions were clearly overlapping with euchromatin and pericentric heterochromatin regions of the chromosome, respectively (Fig. 3).22,32 This consistent pattern has been observed in other plant species indicating an evolutionarily conserved preference mechanism either due to local genomics features or open chromatin structure.1 We used recombination prone regions to perform de novo DNA motif discovery, together with other genomic features identification.

Validated inferred parental genotype and RIL haplotype blocksValidation of our genotyping approach for both parental lines and RILs was done using KASP assays. Five plants were excluded because either seed germination or DNA isolation was unsuccessful. An additional four plants were discarded after genotyping because of high levels of heterozygosity. Two plants showing random genotypes were also removed, as these plants were noticeably different from the corresponding resequenced RILs and were most likely the result of a mix up of supplied seeds, either before or during genotyping. During data analysis, three out of 133 successful KASP assays were discarded. Two of them failed for more than half of the population and one was non-polymorphic. All the remaining assays were polymorphic, confirming the identification of polymorphic markers from resequencing data.After above-mentioned filtering steps, we successfully genotyped 49 RILs using 130 KASP assays. RIL haplotypes estimated with low-coverage resequencing data were validated by KASP assays with an accuracy of 96.8%. This accuracy increased to 98.0% when only homozygous markers were considered. These high accuracies confirmed our methodology for both marker selection and haplotype block estimation using low-coverage resequencing data. Markers identified by resequencing of S. lycopersicum and inferred markers of S. pimpinellifolium matched with 99.2% of the assays, proving high accuracy of our methodology to infer markers for one of the parental lines.3.4. AT-rich DNA motifs are enriched at recombination prone regionsPrevious reports in Arabidopsis thaliana and Citrus clementina have identified DNA motifs associated with recombination sites.5,8,37 In tomato, since the genome-wide high-resolution recombination pattern was unavailable, it was not possible to analyse recombination associated DNA sequence motifs so far. We carried out a de novo DNA motif discovery in recombination prone regions together with 0, 1, 2.5 and 5kbp flanking regions to discover sequence motifs in tomato. Several motifs were discovered out of which six motifs were found to be over-enriched compared to equivalent random sequences. These motifs were consistently enriched in recombination prone regions with 0–5kbp flanking regions (see section Materials and methods; Fig. 4). DNA sequence motifs enriched at recombination prone regions, including 1000bp flanking regions. (See online article for colour version of this figure).DNA sequence motifs enriched at recombination prone regions, including 1000bp flanking regions. (See online article for colour version of this figure).Within enriched motifs, homopolymer poly-A and poly-T occurred in all recombination prone regions. Additionally, we identified a poly-T/poly-A motif in all recombination prone regions with the highest adjusted P-value compared to the whole tomato genome as background (Fig. 4). This motif is similar to motifs reported in earlier studies5,8 and associated with nucleosome boundaries.38 Besides the poly-T/poly-A motif, a 15bp TATA-repeat was discovered. Both the TATA-repeat and poly-T/poly-A motif were reported for the first time and further studies are required to establish the functional correlation. In contrast, the CCN-repeat motif previously identified in Arabidopsis was not identified in our study. Meanwhile, the CTT-repeat motif identified in Arabidopsis was detected, but was not enriched.3.5. Recombination prone regions in tomato occurred at gene and promoter regionsWe further analysed other genomic features associated with recombination prone regions. All recombination prone regions were observed within euchromatin regions. We examined the position of recombination prone regions in the genome using tomato gene annotation. Recombination prone regions showed a tendency to be at or near to genes. This is consistent to previous observations in Arabidopsis.5 We have found that gene body was significantly over-represented in recombination prone regions (P-value 0.01 [permutation test]). Notably, features such as 3'-UTR and promoter showed significant enrichment in recombination prone regions (P-value 1.403 × 10-6 and 0.00043, respectively [permutation test]). Forty-eight recombination prone regions overlapped with at least one annotated gene. We repeated the analysis by excluding pericentric heterochromatin from the expected probability analysis. This stringent analysis also showed consistent enrichment (Fig. 5). However, for genes overlapping with recombination prone regions, no enrichment was found for either any gene ontology category or NB-LRR resistance genes.

(See online article for colour version of this figure).Positions of recombination prone regions based on tomato genome annotation. Standard error is represented by grey error bars. (See online article for colour version of this figure).We visualized the genomic distance from recombination prone regions to the nearest gene and observed that the distance to the nearest gene was lower when starting from a recombination prone region, than when starting from a randomly sampled region (Fig. 6). We observed that a remarkable 74% of recombination prone regions were at gene or promoter regions, compared with the random average expected rate of 32%. Furthermore, this pattern was persistent despite removing pericentric heterochromatin, known for low gene density, from the analysis. Similar observations were made in Arabidopsis thaliana where recombination targets AT-rich promoter sites.5 Although tomato has lower gene density compared with Arabidopsis thaliana, strikingly, it has over-enrichment of recombination prone regions at gene body. This might be due to longer tomato genes and the genomic composition of the tomato genome. These observations indicate that gene or promoter associated genomic features, such as DNA motifs and chromatin stage, may influence recombination sites.

DiscussionMarker identification and selection are crucial when markers are identified using low-coverage resequencing data. Therefore, we developed a population-based methodology to compile marker sets, using various criteria to ensure selected markers were genuine markers rather than sequencing or reference genome artefacts. The methodology is based on only selecting genomic positions that have multiple unequivocal called SNPs that match with the genetic characteristics of those expected from a RIL population. By selecting these positions, the sequencing and read alignment artefacts introduced with low-coverage sequencing were reduced to less than one per cent. In order to achieve this, markers for a RIL population were filtered to contain high percentages of homozygous calls and an equal ratio between reference and alternative calls. Different parameters will be desired when using other population types and sizes. Also, the quality of the used sequencing technique and the average depth strongly influence the desired parameters. We observed that in tomato the added value of increased genome coverage is depreciating above a coverage of 10, similar to Arabidopsis thaliana resequencing recommendations.39 Therefore, we suggest a minimum coverage of 10 for projects with similar experimental setup and aim.We confirmed the efficiency of our approach to estimate haplotypes by KASP validation, and identified a specificity of 97.96% for homozygous haplotypes. The same KASP validation was used to show the efficiency and specificity of our inferred S. pimpinellifolium genotypes and validated 99.63% of these inferred genotypes. Only one assay was found to be monomorphic between parental lines. However, within the RIL population, this locus had 18 reference calls, 24 alternative calls and 1 heterozygous call, pointing to the likelihood that this error was introduced by the used KASP assay.Despite conservative selection of markers, we were able to use 4,463,846 markers for genotyping. This in combination with the variable sliding window approach we developed, allowed us to identify recombination patterns in tomato at an unprecedented resolution, with a median size of 2,134bp. By accumulating the identified recombination events, we managed to increase the resolution of recombination prone regions to a median size of 1,204bp. The achieved resolution is the highest so far in tomato, improving the accuracy of subsequent identification of associated genomic features. Although the false-negative rate of our variable sliding window approach is unknown, we deliberately selected parameters and elected specificity over sensitivity in order to accurately predict genomic features associated with recombination prone regions. Genomes with high repeat content and incomplete reference genome would benefit the most from our marker selection and methodology to estimate haplotype blocks.We have identified 112 recombination prone regions from 60 interspecific tomato RILs in which 74% of recombination prone regions overlapped with gene or promoter regions. This strong preference is consistent with previous reports from Arabidopsis thaliana,5,10,Zea mays40 and Mimulus guttatus.41 Contradictory to Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, where high recombination rate in resistance genes was reported, our recombination prone regions showed no enrichment for these type of genes.42,43 This might be due to heterogeneity in resistance genes or diversity in used parental lines. In all chromosomes, we identified recombination deprived regions to be centric to centromere. This might be due to the extended pericentric heterochromatin in tomato.32Previous studies, particularly those in Arabidopsis thaliana, have found poly-A and CTT-repeat motifs to be enriched in hotspot sequences. Recombination prone regions described in this study were found to be enriched with AT-rich motifs. The presence of poly-A motif in all recombination prone regions was prominent in our analysis, whereas CTT-repeats were not enriched. However, lately it has been shown in Arabidopsis that CCN repeats were enriched at crossover regions though they were preferentially associated with genes but not with promoters.10 These observations indicate that although similarities in DNA motif and genomic features are found across plant species, there are differences too. Differences between eukaryotic species in mechanistic performances also are likely to occur, when looking at preferred recombination sites in human, mice, plants and yeast.1,44Besides previously reported poly-A motif, we identified a novel TATA-repeat and poly-T/poly-A motif. According to the literature, these AT-rich motifs are associated with strong nucleosome free regions, of which poly-T/A results in the most robust nucleosome-free region.38 Furthermore, the flanking DNA on both sides of the motif is considered to be nucleosome depleted as well, and this effect would remain significant over ~100–150bp.45 In yeast, nucleosome depletion is in fact especially pronounced around AT-rich repeats and nucleosomes containing the histone variant H2A.Z tend to border tandem repeats.46,47 Additionally, H2A.Z is associated with transcriptional regulation, anti-silencing, silencing and genome stability suggesting that H2A.Z and recombination rates could have several other biological relevancies.48 Hence the presence of poly-T to poly-A tract, among the other enriched motifs in recombination-related sequences in tomato, infers the possibility of nucleosome depletion at recombination prone region. These consistent and emergent observations about the association between recombination prone region, gene promoter region, nucleosome depletion and AT-rich DNA motifs indicate an evolutionary conserved mechanism within eukaryotes and demands further causality studies. Better understanding of the effect of these genetic and genomics features on recombination will provide tools to modulate recombination for the advancement of plant breeding.This tool is available for academic research.

IntroductionGene duplication is believed to be a rich source of novel functions and adaptations.1–3 This belief is supported by evidence coming from innovations following gene duplications in yeast, plants and animals. Indeed, protein families expanded after whole genome and small-scale duplications yielding an unprecedented morphological diversity in plants.4–11 Other major innovations in animals have also been achieved through gene duplication,12 including increased synapse and behaviour complexity13 and the neural crest formation and plasticity in vertebrates.14 In yeast, gene duplication has contributed to metabolic innovation through the alteration of regulatory and transcriptional networks15 or the increased glycolytic fluxes.16 However, it remains unclear why certain duplicates have been preferred over others to persist in the genomes and be the source of innovations.Since duplication is immediately followed by relaxed selection constraints on one or the two gene copies, the survival time of each gene copy is a limiting factor in the determination of its functional fate. In the majority of cases, duplication is resolved by the non-functionalization of one of the gene copies and its subsequent erosion from the genome.1,3 Accordingly, 92% of all genes that were duplicated through whole-genome duplication (WGD) > 100 MYA in Saccharomyces returned to single copy genes ‘shortly’ after duplication.17 Nonetheless, in many species, including yeast, the number of duplicated genes is larger than predicted by theory ranging between 30% of the genes in yeast18 and more than 50% in plants.6,19 Determining what genes remain in the genome as duplicates, and consequently lead to evolutionary leaps, is an important aim in evolutionary biology. However, this objective remains to be achieved.A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the persistence of certain genes in duplicate. Rapid sequence divergence between gene copies can lead to their functional divergence followed by strong selective constraints on each copy, which could contribute to the preservation of duplicates in the genomes.20–23 Functional divergence requires, nevertheless, long evolutionary times and given that selection relaxes after gene duplication, selective pressures are unlikely to retain both gene copies during the first million years following duplication. Preservation of duplicates can also be selectively favoured by the need to maintain gene–dosage balance,5,21,24,25 or provide genetic robustness against deleterious mutations.26,27 However, all these scenarios do not provide a general mechanistic explanation for what makes duplicates persist or alternatively perish.Recently, it has been proposed dosage sub-functionalization as a plausible hypothesis to explain the fate of whole-genome duplicates.28 According to this hypothesis, highly expressed genes are more likely to be preserved as duplicates than lowly expressed genes. This is because stochastic variations in the levels of expression of the gene copies of highly expressed duplicates would not lead to copies with a lower expression level than that required for purifying selection to act upon them. Therefore, highly expressed duplicates are less likely to return to single copy genes by drift. Whether this hypothesis could be applied to all duplicates regardless of the mechanism that originated them and whether such dosage sub-functionalization could also determine the patterns of divergence between gene copies has not been explored before.Here, we present evidence that the levels of gene expression are correlated with the fates of whole-genome and small-scale duplicates, with highly expressed genes being more likely to be retained in double copy after duplication for longer periods of time than lowly expressed genes. Such duplicates are also more phylogenetically stable. We also show that the ancestral levels of gene expression are correlated with the evolution of duplicates expression. Retained duplicated genes evolve strong patterns of transcriptional (also known as phenotypic) plasticity, which are also correlated with the levels of gene expression. Finally, while the levels of gene expression are correlated with the duplicability of genes, duplicates phenotypic plasticity is manifested only after gene duplication; and this plasticity is proportional to the expression divergence between the copies of duplicated genes.2. Material and methods2.1. Identification of duplicated genesParalogs pairs of duplicated genes were identified as the resulting best reciprocal hits from all-against-all BLAST searches using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1E-5 and a 50 bit score.29 Paralogs were then divided into two groups according to the mechanism of their origin: WGDs and SSDs. WGDs are those extracted from the reconciled list provided by the Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB, http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie//ygob30) (555 pairs of genes), and these were not subjected to subsequent SSD. All other paralogs were considered to belong to the category of SSDs (560 pairs of genes).2.2. Growth of S. cerevisiae and gene expression analysesThe transcriptomic profiling was performed in the S. cerevisiae Y06240 haploid msh2 deletion strain (BY4741; Mata his3D1 leu2DO met15DO ura3DO msh2::kanMX4), with three technical replicates for each biological stress condition (3% lactic acid (YPL), 3% ethanol (YPE), 3% glycerol (YPG), 0.25mM H2O2 + 1.5% dextrose (YPOxD)) in comparison with the normal growth condition (YPD media) (Fig. 1). Total RNA extractions were performed with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer instructions. Ribosomal RNA was removed by using Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA removal yeast (Illumina) depletion kit. Stranded RNA libraries were constructed using TruSeq stranded mRNA (Illumina) from oligo-dT captured mRNAs from depleted samples. Libraries were run in NextSeq 500 (Illumina) at 75nt single read by using High Output 75 cycles kit v2.0 (Illumina). Growth experiments of S. cerevisiae under stress conditions. An initial isogenic population of S. cerevisiae (strain Y06240) was grown for 24 h in Yeast extract, peptone, dextrose medium (YPD) at 28 °C. This grown population was then subjected to four different stress conditions: ethanol, glycerol, lactate and oxidative stress in a medium supplemented with dextrose (each stress in indicated in a different colour). Growth experiments were performed in triplicate. Samples of each of the populations, in addition to the control population grown in YPD, were processed for RNA sequencing. The technical steps for the extraction and analysis of RNA sequences are also shown.Growth experiments of S. cerevisiae under stress conditions.

The technical steps for the extraction and analysis of RNA sequences are also shown.RNA libraries were sequenced at Genomic core facility at Servicio Central de Soporte a la Investigación Experimental (SCSIE) from University of Valencia, Spain. Raw reads were analyzed using FastQC report and cleaned with CutAdapt as implemented in RobiNA software package v 1.2.4.31 Low-quality reads were filtered and trimmed (Phred score inferior to 20 and size less than 40 nt were discarded). The reads were then aligned with Bowtie (up to two mismatches accepted) to the reference transcriptome (PRJNA290217) from the reference S288c strain. The normalization and statistical evaluation of differential gene expression has been performed using edgeR32 or DESeq33 with a P-value cut-off of 0.05, using the Benjamini–Yekutieli34 method for multiple testing correction of P-value, and setting the Log-fold change at min = 1 to determine differential expression. The raw data (reads counts) was normalized according to the default procedure of the differential expression analysis package used (edgeR or DESeq), being the dispersion estimated using the pooled setting, and RPKM (Reads Per Billion) expression values estimated as implemented in RobiNA software.31 All newly sequenced RNA sequences are available from the Sequence Read Archive with the following accession number (SRP074821). Expression data for each of the S. cerevisiae genes under YPD and each of the four stress conditions as well as the adjusted probabilities to identify significant fold changes are available in Supplementary Tables S1–S4.2.3. Expression data for Lachancea kluyveriGrowth conditions, RNA extraction and sequencing are specified in a previous study.35 Briefly, authors performed the analyses on L. kluyveri reference strain CBS 3082_a (MATa). Transcriptomic data were obtained from growth cultures at mid exponential phase and for 20 different media, including YPD and 19 other stress conditions (listed in Ref. [35]). RNA sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform with 50-base pair non-oriented single reads (Supplementary Table S5).2.4. Expression data for Candida glabrataCandida glabrata ATC2001 strain expression data (in the form of RPKMs) were obtained from a previous study.36 Briefly, authors grown C. glabrata in normal YPD media and in the M199 medium at different pH values for pH shift. Total RNA was isolated by hot phenol–chlorophorm method. Libraries were subjected to ribosomal RNA depletion, and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform with 100-bp paired-end strand-specific. Reads were mapped with TOPHAT2, and counted using htseq (-m union, -t exon conditions) and normalized by the number of reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (Supplementary Table S6). Differentially expressed genes were identified with raw counts by DeSeq and EdgeR, using the same cut-off parameters than the ones used in this study.2.5. SoftwareCalculations and statistics were performed using MS Excel and R 3.2.1. Data management was possible using in-house built PERL scripts.3. Results3.1. Duplicates preservation and phylogenetic stability are correlated with the levels of gene expressionHighly expressed genes are more likely to be preserved as duplicates after whole-genome duplication (WGD) than lowly expressed genes in S. cerevisiae.37,28,38–41 We searched for the orthologs of S. cerevisiae genes in L. kluyveri (strain CBS 3082; synonymous of Saccharomyces kluyveri) and their expression in Yeast Extract Peptone containing dextrose medium (YPD)35 (Supplementary Table S5). Lachancea kluyveri is a respiratory yeast species pre-dating the WGD that took place in S. cerevisiae > 100 million years ago.17 We found L. kluyveri orthologs for 5643 S. cerevisiae genes. Of the 5643 genes, 1469 genes were orthologs of S. cerevisiae duplicates, including WGDs and small-scale duplicates (SSDs), and 4174 were orthologs of S. cerevisiae singletons (Supplementary Table S5). The expression of L. kluyveri orthologs of S. cerevisiae duplicates (Median: 10.43; measured as the log2-transformed Reads Per billion, RPKM) was significantly greater than that of L. kluyveri orthologs of S. cerevisiae singletons (Median: 9.52) (Wilcoxon rank test: P < 2.2 × 10-16). We compared the transcription levels of genes in S. cerevisiae obtained in our study with those from another study42 that used ribosomal profiling, a technique that measures ribosome occupancy and translation genome wide and provides an accurate measure of the translatable mRNA. RPKMs correlated strongly and significantly with the data of ribosome profiling (Spearman’s correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.77, P < 2.2 × 10-16, Supplementary Data S1), indicating that RPKMs are indicative of the levels of gene expression and also the translatable mRNAs.Previous studies concluded that highly expressed genes were more likely to be preserved as duplicates after WGDs because of absolute dosage constraints and constraints on dosage balance.28,37,39,43–46 Indeed, we found that this trend is true for L. kluyveri orthologs of S. cerevisiae WGDs (N = 561, Median expression: 10.64, Wilcoxon rank test: P < 2.2 × 10-16) and also for orthologs of S. cerevisiae SSDs (N = 908, Median expression: 10.28, Wilcoxon rank test: P < 2.2 × 10-16). The level of expression of orthologs of WGDs was, nevertheless, higher than that for SSDs (Wilcoxon rank test: P = 7.79 × 10-5).The higher expression of duplicates compared to singletons can be due to a greater presence of genes encoding protein-complex proteins among duplicates than singletons. We extracted the list of protein complexes from a previous study, using the table of annotated yeast high-throughput complexes available at (http://wodaklab.org/cyc2008/downloads).47 Genes encoding proteins that are part of protein complexes (N =  1913) (Supplementary Table S7) do exhibit greater expression (Median expression: 11.56) than genes encoding complex-free proteins (N = 3960) (Median expression: 10.61, Wilcoxon rank test: P < 2.2 × 10-16). However, neither WGDs were more enriched for complex-encoding genes than singletons in S. cerevisiae (Fishers exact test: F = 1.02, P = 0.76) nor SSDs showed significant difference in terms of enrichment for complex-encoding genes when compared to singletons (Fishers exact test: F = 1.11, P = 0.15).One caveat in this analysis is that gene expression in L. kluyveri may not reflect gene expression immediately after WGD. Against this prediction, gene expression in L. kluyveri, a species predating the WGDs and SSDs used in this study, was strongly and significantly correlated with gene expression in S. cerevisiae (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.59, P < 2.2 × 10-16, Fig. 2a).

(e) Correlation of PS of SSDs and their expression levels.Duplicated genes exhibit different patterns of gene retention and phylogenetic stability in the different post-WGD Saccharomyces species.48 We classified S. cerevisiae duplicated genes according to the presence of the two copies in each of the twelve available species post-dating the WGD (Fig. 2b). We first asked whether the expression of duplicates generated before Saccharomycetales speciation (including WGDs and SSDs) correlates with their phylogenetic stability, measured as the mean number of post-WGD species in which each copy was present (Fig. 2b). To determine the number of species postdating WGD in which each gene copy is present we used the Pillars information available from the Yeast Gene Order Information,30 which provides gene order and annotation for 12 post-WGD yeast species (Supplementary Table S8). For each gene copy, we counted the number of species in which it is found and averaged this number for the two sister gene copies in a duplicated pair (Fig. 2b). There was a positive and significant correlation between the mean gene copies expression in YPD and their phylogenetic stability (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.27, P < 2.2 × 10-16, Fig. 2c). We then repeated the analysis for WGDs and SSDs separately. WGDs exhibited positive weak but significant correlation between gene expression and phylogenetic stability (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.13, P = 1.15 × 10-5, Fig. 2d). In contrast, SSDs showed strong and significant correlation between gene expression and phylogenetic stability (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.40, P < 2.2 × 10-16, Fig. 2e).3.2. The magnitude of divergence of duplicates expression correlates with the level of gene expressionwith E referring to the expression of the gene under normal conditions (Supplementary Table S9). Di,j is normalized by the level of gene expression (i.e. the value is 0 = Di,j = 1), and thus it is an unbiased measure of the expression divergence between the gene copies. In support of our hypothesis, there was a weak but very significant correlation between the average expression of the gene copies of duplicates and Di,j (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.18, P = 4.23 × 10-8). This correlation was also maintained when we analyzed separately WGDs (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.18, P = 6.98 × 10-5) and SSDs (Spearman correlation: <U+03C1> = 0.17, P = 2.89 × 10-4).3.3. The expression levels and promoter architecture correlate with patterns of expression divergence of duplicates and their transcriptional plasticityBecause higher expression can increase the chance for expression divergence after gene duplication, we sought to investigate if genes with higher expression can also evolve greater transcriptional plasticity under stress. Transcriptional plasticity is defined here as the ability of the gene to change its expression, while keeping its genotype, when the environment changes. For all four stresses with which S. cerevisiae was challenged (see section Material and methods), transcriptionally altered duplicates belonged to a set of genes with significantly higher expression in YPD growth media than transcriptionally unaltered duplicates (Fig. 3a–d). This was also true, with the exception of ethanol-induced stress, for singletons, albeit the effect was more pronounced in duplicates than it was in singletons. Noticeably, for all four-stress conditions in S. cerevisiae, the levels of expression of duplicates with no altered transcription under stress were significantly higher than that for transcriptionally altered singletons (Fig. 3a–d). The levels of gene expression determine the transcriptional plasticity of genes. We present the levels of expression as the logarithmic transformation of the Reads Per billion (RPKM) for duplicates (red boxes) and singletons (blue boxes) with transcriptional alterations and duplicates (orange boxes) and singletons (white boxes) without altered expressions when S. cerevisiae is faced with four different stress conditions (a) Ethanol, (b) glycerol, (c) lactate and (d) oxidative stress in a medium supplemented with dextrose.

One important factor that contributes to transcriptional plasticity is the existence of the TATA-box motif in the gene promoter, with TATA-containing genes being more sensitive to regulatory changes than TATA-less genes.49 Importantly, the level of expression of TATA-containing genes was higher than that of TATA-less genes, and this was true for duplicates and singletons in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4a). The set of transcriptionally altered genes under stress conditions was enriched for TATA-containing genes when compared to the set of genes with no transcriptional plasticity, being this true for duplicates (Fig. 4b) and singletons (Fig. 4c). Generally, TATA-containing genes also exhibit expression noise, which can be coupled with transcriptional plasticity provided that noise and plasticity are not in conflict.50 Since gene duplication relaxes noise-plasticity conflict,50 we expected duplicated genes to be enriched for TATA motifs when compared to singletons. Of the 1090 genes containing TATA-motifs, 558 belonged to duplicates (281 were WGDs and 277 were SSDs) (25% of all duplicates) and 532 to singletons (12% of all singletons) (Supplementary Table S10). Indeed, duplicated genes were more enriched for TATA-containing genes than singletons (Fishers exact test: F = 2.52, P < 2.2 × 10-16), and this was the case for both transcriptionally plastic genes and genes with no transcriptional plasticity (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Remarkably, duplicates with no transcriptional plasticity were slightly more enriched for TATA-containing genes than singletons with transcriptional plasticity, with the difference being significant in the case of S. cerevisiae grown under oxidative stress (Supplementary Fig. S1b). TATA-containing genes exhibit greater expression levels and transcriptional plasticity than TATA-less genes.

Expression divergence between gene copies correlates with transcriptional plasticity of duplicatesExpression divergence between gene copies correlates with transcriptional plasticity of duplicates3.4. The levels of gene expression correlate with the patterns of duplicates transcriptional plasticityA prediction of the dosage sub-functionalization hypothesis is that the patterns of duplicates transcriptional plasticity should be dependent on the levels of gene expression. For instance, transcriptionally plastic genes that are lowly expressed under normal conditions should only be able to over-express under stress because a decline in their expression could drive one of the gene copies to non-functionalization due to relaxed selective constraints. Because plasticity is often correlated with expression noise50 and, since surviving duplicates are those whose expression noise falls within the range of expression detectable by selection, expression noise should depend on the levels of duplicates expression. We divided duplicated genes according to the patterns of transcriptional plasticity they show when S. cerevisiae is grown under stress: (i) up-regulated: when the two gene copies were up-regulated under stress; (ii) down-regulated: when the two gene copies were down-regulated under stress; (iii) discordant: when one copy was up-regulated and the other was down-regulated under stress; and (iv) one-altered: when one copy was not altered but its paralogous copy was either up-regulated or down-regulated under stress (Supplementary Tables S11–S26). In all four stress conditions, duplicates that were down-regulated were also those that exhibited the highest expression levels under normal conditions, being these followed by duplicates in which only one copy exhibits transcriptional plasticity, then discordant duplicates and finally up-regulated duplicates (Fig. 5a–d). The expression level of duplicates correlated with their patterns of expression divergence. Expression was measured as the logarithmic transformation of the Reads Per billion (RPKM).

The levels of gene expression correlate with the level of expression divergence in duplicates in which gene copies are either discordant (one copy up-regulated and the other copy down-regulated) or one copy only altered under stress. Transcriptional alteration patterns of duplicates were measured in four stress conditions (ethanol, glycerol, lactate and oxidative stress in a medium supplemented with dextrose). Expression divergence of duplicates was measured as 1 – (the expression of the lowest expressed copy divided by the expression of the highest expressed copy). Spearman correlation (<U+03C1>) between the levels of gene expression (measured as the logarithmic transformation of the Reads Per billion (RPKM)) and the levels of expression divergence was tested for significance.

Gene duplication has contributed to increased transcriptional plasticity in yeastWe examined the link between gene duplication and phenotypic plasticity by comparing the transcriptomes of S. cerevisiae grown under a number of key stress conditions that this species faces in nature to those transcriptomes of S. cerevisiae grown under normal YPD media (section Material and methods). Transcriptionally altered genes were more enriched for duplicates than for singleton genes over all stress conditions (Fig. 7). This trend was also true when we compared WGDs to singletons and SSDs to singletons (Fig. 7). To determine whether transcriptional plasticity is directly linked to gene duplication, we examined the transcriptional plasticity of S. cerevisiae duplicates and singletons orthologs in the pre-WGD species L. kluyveri. The transcription of L. kluyveri genes was previously assessed in 19 different stress conditions.35 For each condition, we sought the percentage of genes that were orthologs to S. cerevisiae duplicates (N = 1469) and singletons (N = 4174) that exhibited transcriptional alteration. In 18 of the 19 conditions, there was no significant difference in the percentage of transcriptionally altered genes under stress between the orthologs of S. cerevisiae duplicates and those of singleton (Table 2). The only exception was SDS stress, in which the percentage of transcriptionally altered orthologs for S. cerevisiae duplicates was higher than that for transcriptionally altered singleton orthologs (Fishers exact test: odds ratio F = 1.22, P = 5 × 10-3, Table 2). In all other stresses that were equivalent to the ones used in our experiments (e.g. glycerol, ethanol), there was no significant difference in the number of transcriptionally altered genes between orthologs of S. cerevisiae duplicates and singletons (Table 2). These data indicate that the high transcriptional plasticity of duplicates in S. cerevisiae was acquired after gene duplication.

(b) Venn diagram representing the overlap in the number of duplicates and singletons between C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae.To shed more light on the role of gene duplication in the acquisition of transcriptional plasticity, we examined the transcriptional patterns of a post-WGD species, Candida glabrata, in which some orthologs of S. cerevisiae duplicates are in single gene copy in C. glabrata, while others are preserved as duplicates and for which we had transcriptional information under acidic stress similar to our lactate stress dataset.36,Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologs in C. glabrata were identified using synteny information available in the Pillars of the Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB).30 In total, we identified 4844 reliable S. cerevisiae: C. glabrata orthologs. Of these 4844 genes, 788 genes were duplicated in C. glabrata, of which 123 were orthologs of S. cerevisiae singletons. These 4844 genes included 1659 out of the 2240 duplicated S. cerevisiae genes and 3185 singletons. Of the 2240 S. cerevisiae duplicates, orthologs for 1019 of them were in single gene copy in C. glabrata (Fig. 7b). Importantly, these 1019 genes exhibited as much transcriptional plasticity under acidic stress in C. glabrata (N = 599, 58.7% of the C. glabrata singletons) as C. glabrata singletons that had no duplicates orthologs in S. cerevisiae (1725 out of 3062 singletons, 56.3%) (Fisher’s exact test: odd’s ratio F = 1.10, P = 0.17). In conclusion, transcriptional plasticity seem to have been acquired after gene duplication because orthologs of duplicates that are in single copy genes in other species exhibit no evidence for transcriptional plasticity in these species.3.6. Transcriptionally plastic duplicates contribute to the response of S. cerevisiae to stressAmong the transcriptionally plastic duplicates, many had a significant biological role in the response to stress. For instance, analyses of duplicated genes up-regulated when S. cerevisiae is grown in ethanol identified a number of genes as largely up-regulated that are involved in ethanol metabolism (Supplementary Table S27). Heading the list of up-regulated duplicates is the one encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase ADH2 and ADH1, directly involved in the quick metabolism of ethanol inside the cell into acetaldehyde (Fig. 8). A number of other duplicated genes that are essential in the metabolism of Ethanol, including transmembrane transporters such as YAT1 to start the tricarboxylic cycle or the enzyme MSL1 that is essential for malate production, among others (Fig. 8), they are all listed as duplicates with the highest up-regulation. This also applies to other stress conditions used in this study (Fig. 8).

DiscussionA number of factors have been considered key players in determining the fates of duplicated genes. However, an explanation that provides a general and inherent mechanism that strongly determines the duplicability of genes has been poorly investigated. Here, we present strong evidence that the levels of gene expression determine the likelihood of a gene to persist duplicated in the genome. We find that genes that are highly expressed in species pre-dating the whole-genome duplication event in Saccharomyces are more likely to be preserved in duplicate in species originated after duplication. This observation is in agreement with the dosage sub-functionalization hypothesis (DSH), as high levels of gene expression would ensure purifying selection on the gene copies despite the stochastic variation in their expression levels.28 We, nevertheless, show that this is not a link exclusively seen in WGDs because the preservation of SSDs is also dependent on the expression levels of genes, however to a lesser extent than WGDs.We also show that highly expressed genes exhibit greater phylogenetic stability (i.e. they are preserved in greater number of post-duplication species) than lowly expressed genes, perhaps due to the higher likelihood of functional divergence between gene copies of highly expressed duplicates, and thus emergence of purifying selection to maintain the functions of gene copies. Therefore, we conclude that the levels of gene expression determine the survival of duplicates across long evolutionary times. Our observations are not confounded by other factors such as dosage balance, mainly an issue in the case of genes encoding proteins that are part of protein complexes,28,39,43,45,46 as neither WGDs nor SSDs are enriched for complex-encoding genes when compared to singletons in S. cerevisiae.A pivotal conclusion derived from the link between gene expression and duplicability is that gene copies with higher expression levels can be noisier in terms of expression without undergoing an imbalance in their selective pressures. This noise could eventually lead to higher divergence between the gene copies of these duplicates when such divergence becomes adaptive. Our results are in agreement with this prediction and show that the magnitude of expression divergence, and perhaps functional divergence, is dependent on the levels of gene expression. Therefore, duplicates with higher expression are more likely to lead to higher divergence between the gene copies. This higher divergence between gene copies has been likely important for the origin of novel adaptations to stressful environments in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.26,27,51–53 In agreement with this hypothesis, when S. cerevisiae was faced with a number of stress conditions, the levels of expression divergence between gene copies was positively correlated with their expression plasticity. Importantly, we show that the levels of gene expression also influence the patterns of transcriptional divergence between the gene copies of duplicates. Those duplicates with copies exhibiting discordant expression patterns or with only one copy altered under stress are likely those in which each copy encodes a function under different conditions compared to the other copy.Expression noise is generally coupled with plasticity if noise and plasticity do not present a cost-benefit conflict (i.e. a conflict emerges when plasticity is important for adaptation but noisy expression can be detrimental).50,54,55 We show that duplicates are both more enriched for transcriptionally plastic genes and for genes with TATA motifs in their promoters when compared with singletons. TATA-motifs have been shown to be associated with higher noise and plasticity in TATA-containing genes.49,56,57 The expression properties of genes that have been preserved as duplicates are, therefore, remarkably different from those that returned to single copy genes. Noticeably, non-plastic duplicates that showed higher expression levels than transcriptionally plastic singletons also exhibited greater enrichment for TATA-containing genes than plastic singletons, linking TATA-containing genes to higher levels of gene expression. The question that remains is then whether it is the expression properties or duplication itself that have determined the fate of duplicates and the origin of adaptations. Our results lead to the conclusion that duplicated genes exhibit significantly different expression properties than singleton genes but also that gene duplication is mainly responsible for the origin of plasticity, as the transcriptional plasticity observed in S. cerevisiae originated after the duplication of genes which were not transcriptionally more plastic before duplication than other non-duplicable genes. Therefore, gene duplication provides the appropriate genetic and selective opportunity for the evolution of transcriptional plasticity. A remarkable result is that the percentage of singletons transcriptionally altered in S. cerevisiae was significantly lower than that of their orthologs altered in L. kluyveri. However, the absolute percentages of altered genes cannot be compared between L. kluyveri and S. cerevisiae as both species represent completely different metabolisms and the conditions of stress under which they were subjected were different. It is, therefore, likely that duplication itself may relax the cost–benefit conflict between noise and plasticity, as previously suggested,50 allowing for the emergence of plasticity and adaptation to environmental perturbations. In conclusion, our result point to a strong correlation between the expression properties of genes, their duplicability, transcriptional plasticity, and ability to give rise to novel adaptations.We would like to thank members of Fares’ Lab for a careful reading and discussion of the results in the manuscript.

IntroductionBecause of advanced genetics and simple and easy production of mutants, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most widely used unicellular eukaryotic model organism. It is the best known member of the genus Saccharomyces with accepted species: S. cerevisiae, S. cariocanus, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. arboricolus, S. bayanus var. bayanus, S. bayanus var. uvarum and S. pastorianus.1 These yeast species are involved in fermenting sugars and produce enormous amounts of ethanol; however, most of the strains used to manufacture beer, wine or fuel ethanol are interspecific hybrids.2–4 Therefore, the taxonomic classifications of alloploid species S. pastorianus and S. bayanus do not agree with the outcome of whole genome sequencing.4,5These discrepancies arose exclusively from the comparison of nuclear chromosomes. The data for much smaller mitochondrial genomes encoding only eight proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation, one ribosomal protein, two ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), the RNA component of RNase P, and a set of 24 tRNA genes were largely overlooked or unavailable.6,7 Despite large numbers of nuclear genome sequences now accessible for different Saccharomyces species and isolates4,8,–10 completed mitochondrial genome sequences are known only for S. cerevisiae,6,S. paradoxus,11,S. pastorianus12 and Saccharomyces eubayanus.5 Recently, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from S. bayanus and S. pastorianus were sequenced but not annotated.13 The problem is associated with the short DNA reads (100–200 nt) generated by the most next-generation sequencing platforms in genomic studies, especially by Illumina MiSeq.14–17 This approach can be used routinely for sequencing mtDNA from different yeast species18 but not from many species of Saccharomyces.9,16,17 Their mitochondrial genomes can be assembled only by combination of different gap-filling programmes19 or by extensive manual editing.20,21The purpose of this work was to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes for all species assigned to Saccharomyces with the aim of comparing their genetic content to that of S. cerevisiae, as many different Saccharomyces mtDNAs can substitute, to some extent, for the original molecule in S. cerevisiae.222. Materials and methods2.1. Yeast strains and mtDNA sequencingSequenced strains are being used as taxonomic standards (type strains)1 in whole genome studies,4,10 or their mtDNA is being transferred to S. cerevisiae in order to prepare xenomitochondrial cybrids.22 Their origin is described in detail in reference.22,Saccharomyces arboricolus NRRL Y-63701 and S. pastorianus NRRL Y-27171NT were kindly provided by the Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection, US Department of Agriculture, Peoria, IL, USA. Yeast cells were grown at 28 °C in YPD medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract and 1% peptone). The mtDNA was purified mainly by differential centrifugation23 or alternatively by bisbenzimide/CsCl buoyant density centrifugation.24,25 mtDNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and sequenced with average genome coverage between 176 and 3,698× on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing system using a MiSeq Reagent kit v3 (Illumina) with reads 2 × 100 bp in length. The sequencing summary is listed in Table 1.

Paired reads were trimmed, short reads (often with erroneous sequences) removed and assembled into individual contigs using CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5 (Qiagen, Hilden, DE). From thousands of contigs with an average size of ~1,500 nt, only those containing mtDNA by BLASTN comparison to already known mtDNA from related yeasts (S. cerevisiae NC001224; S. paradoxus JQ862335, S. pastorianus EU852811) were selected. Individual contigs with mtDNA segments were assembled into a single molecule using the Vector NTI v.9.0 (v.10) software package from InforMax, Inc. Overall, 1–10 contigs were obtained covering 98–101% of the entire sequence, depending on the purification method (Table 1). All mtDNAs were interrupted in the redundant intergenic regions, mostly in the origins of replication (ori ~270 nt) and GC clusters. Contigs were manually edited and linked together from individual reads as previously reported.21 Some gaps were sealed by direct sequencing using fluorescent dye terminator sequencing chemistry. Assembly of S. mikatae CBS 8839 (NRRL Y-27341T) mtDNA was confirmed by direct sequencing as previously described.11 The assembled mitochondrial genomes were evaluated by mapping back the raw reads using CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5. However, a few substitutions, indels, and the occasional GC cluster can be found if our mtDNA is aligned to the mtDNA obtained from the same strains by different groups.13Rough gene annotation was carried out with MFannot (http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/cgi-bin/mfannot/mfannotInterface.pl).27 Precise exon and intron positions were corrected according to comparison with annotated sequences from several strains of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus.6,11,20 Intron and endonuclease nomenclature was according to28 and the intergenic open reading frames (ORFs) are numbered according to references.6,29 The sizes of rRNA were inferred from the model elaborated for their equivalents from S. cerevisiae mitochondria.30,31 The 5' and 3' ends of rnpB RNA were deduced from the secondary structure consensus.32 Gene nomenclature followed the rules described in GOBASE.33Saccharomyces arboricolus CBS 10644 mtDNA was assembled from the sequence CM0015799 by manual editing from individual reads (EMBL: ERP001702, ERP001703, ERP001704). Saccharomyces uvarum CBS 395T was assembled from SRR147290 reads downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive, NCBI.262.3. PhylogenyPhylogenetic relationships were analysed by the Maximum likelihood phylogeny PhyML program included in the CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5 package.34 Phylogenetic trees were constructed from unambiguously aligned portions of the concatenated DNA sequences coding for proteins using the neighbor-joining algorithm and the best model (GTR + G + I) selected by model testing tool (hLRT, BIC, AIC, AICc).34 The stability of individual branches was assessed by the bootstrap method.35 DNA concatemers for mitochondrial protein coding sequences belonging to other Saccharomyces strains were extracted from GenBank deposits. The nuclear DNA-derived phylogenetic tree was constructed from protein-coding genes used in population studies.36–39 Because of the hybrid alloploid nature of S. bayanus, S. uvarum and S. pastorianus we used gene sequences from the species that are the least related to S. cerevisiae variants. Corresponding DNA was obtained from assembled contigs occasionally sealed manually from reads (S. cerevisiae NRRL Y-12632T, S. cariocanus CBS 7994T, S. arboricolus NRRL Y-63701, S. paradoxus CBS 2908, S. bayanus CBS 380T). Other concatemers were obtained from sequences, scaffolds (contigs) deposited in the Saccharomyces genome database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) for S. cerevisiae S288c, S. paradoxus CBS 432,6 for S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70,12 for S. kudriavzevii CBS 8840T and S. mikatae CBS 883940 and for S. arboricolus CBS 10644.9 Data for S. bayanus CBS 380 were obtained from contigs assembled from SRR147291 and for S. uvarum CBS 395T were obtained from contigs assembled from SRR147290.26 Data for S. pastorianus NRRL Y-27171NT (CBS 1538) were compiled from contigs assembled by us and scaffolds BBYX01000001.13 Data for S. eubayanus CBS 12357T were obtained from the final genome assembly and annotations in GenBank JMCK00000000.5 Data accessibility. DNA sequences: GenBank accession nos KY095834–KY095933.3. Results and discussion3.1. General features of genes of the genetic code and GUG as a translation startWe have successfully completed mitochondrial genomes for nine Saccharomyces species, and their general features are listed in Table 2 (GenBank accession numbers KX657740–KX657750). All mtDNAs are circularly mapped and their size decreases with phylogenetic distance from S. cerevisiae (89.5 kb) to ~64.7 kb for S. bayanus. GC content varies from 14% for S. paradoxus strains to 19.3% for S. pastorianus and correlates positively with the presence of introns and negatively with the size of AT-rich intergenic spacers. The mtDNAs contain the basic set of genes known in Saccharomyces, coding for the components of cytochrome oxidase (cox1, cox2, cox3), cytochrome b (cob), subunits of ATPase (atp6, atp8, atp9), both rRNA subunits (rnl, rns), the rps3 gene for ribosomal protein, the rnpB gene for the RNA subunit of RNase P and the tRNA package24 (Fig. 1). General features of mitochondrial genomesaAssembled from individual reads (EMBL: ERP001702, ERP001703, ERP001704).9General features of mitochondrial genomesaAssembled from individual reads (EMBL: ERP001702, ERP001703, ERP001704).9The genetic organization of Saccharomyces mtDNA. For simpler comparison, the circular genomes, exported from Vector NTI, were aligned at the beginning of the large rRNA subunit (rnl). Protein-coding genes, ribosomal RNA, rnpB are marked as arrows and bar, tRNA genes as black lines, introns with white rectangles, intronic and free-standing ORFs by gray arrows and replication origins with black circles. Gene nomenclature follows the rules described in GOBASE (atp for ATP synthetase subunits, cox for cytochrome oxidase subunits, cob for cytochrome b, rns for small rRNA ribosomal subunit, rnl for large rRNA ribosomal subunit, T2, C, H, etc. for particular tRNA coding genes, rps3 for ribosomal protein and rnpB for the RNA subunit of RNase P). Sizes are given on the bottom line in kbp.The genetic organization of Saccharomyces mtDNA.

Sizes are given on the bottom line in kbp.The genetic code in Saccharomyces mtDNA differs from the universal code by TGA being read as tryptophan, CTN as threonine, ATA as methionine and CGN for arginine, with CGA and CGC absent, that is recognized as the ‘yeast mitochondrial code’ (transl_table = 3).41–43 The trnR2 gene (anticodon ACG) was found in all Saccharomyces mtDNAs. Thus, all four CGN codons possess coding potential. However, the CGU codon is present in exons only once (besides S. arboricolus) coding for a non-conserved arginine residue in rps3 protein (Supplementary Material S1). In addition, the CGU codon occurs quite frequently in intron-coded or free-standing ORFs, whereas the CGG codon is present only in GC clusters located inside them. The arginine CGA and CGC codons considered as unassigned are also used sporadically in maturase/homing endonucleases (HE) reading frames coded by introns41–44 (Supplementary Material S1). The most convincing evidence is a CGC codon present in the cox1I2 reading frame in a number of S. cerevisiae strains including type strain NRRL Y-12632 and the well-studied model strain S288c. This reverse transcriptase/maturase protein is required for group II intron splicing from cox1 pre-mRNA as well as for intron mobility.45,46 Apparently, tRNA coded by the trnR2 gene is required in Saccharomyces pre-dominantly for the expression of mobile elements and is therefore gained and lost in different clades from the Saccharomyces/Kluyveromyces complex.47,48 Protein-coding genes start with ATG, with some exceptions. The translation start in the S. cariocanus cox3 gene is GTG (GUG), reported to be nearly as effective as the original ATG in the S. cerevisiae cox2 gene.49 Translation initiation at the nearby downstream AUG is not an option because mutagenesis of the regular initiation codon does not allow translation from this site.49 Instead, a stem loop structure in the mRNA sequence of the first six codons plays a role in the recognition of the translation start.50 The first 50 nucleotides in the cox3 genes of all sequenced Saccharomyces are identical, which emphasizes the reliability of GUG as the initiation start codon (Fig. 2A, B). Atypical start codons are present in many mitochondrial systems, but GUG as a start codon is known only in some birds, invertebrates, plants and protists, but not in yeast and molds.43,44 Also, a maternally inherited and practically homoplasmic mtDNA mutation, 8527 A > G, changing the initiation codon AUG into GUG, was observed in the human atp6 gene. The patient harbouring this mutation exhibited clinical symptoms of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, but his mother was healthy.51 The second exception is free-standing ORF1s in S. kudriavzevii, S. mikatae, S. bayanus, S. uvarum, S. arboricolus and S. pastorianus, where GUG is used as a translation start site. This gene with unknown function codes for a hypothetical maturase-like protein, the start codon overlaps with the 3' end of the cox2 gene and the reading frame extends 16 bp downstream of the cox2 stop codon. Consequently, the ‘yeast mitochondrial code’ should be updated to accept CGA and CGC as arginine codons and GTG as the alternative initiation codon (Fig. 2C). The preferable termination codon in exons is UAA, and UAG is used only occasionally in cox2 of S. kudriavzevii and S. mikatae and more often in intron-coded ORFs. Codon usage in the reading frames shows a strong bias towards codons ending with T or A (in 10:1), as previously observed in the mitochondrial genomes of other yeasts6,11 (Supplementary Material S1).

Exceptional codons are grey-shadowed.All sequenced mitochondrial genomes exhibit sequence conservation at the nucleotide level within exons (excluding extremely variable rps3), with at least 94% sequence identity between the most unrelated species and a substitution rate of 11%. The substitutions are mostly neutral and have a low impact on the protein sequence, as they generate nearly identical amino acid residues. Therefore, the overall protein identity, even among less-related species, is 97%. Interestingly, the atp9 protein sequence is identical in all sequenced species. The same DNA substitution rate (6%) in the other small gene, atp8, is responsible for the three changes at the protein level (Supplementary Material S2).3.2 Introns and free-standing ORFsIntrons are present in Saccharomyces only within cox1, cob and rnl genes.22,27 Although the majority are group I introns, four of them belong to group II, and only two of these (cox1I1, cox1I2) code for a protein with the maturase/reverse transcriptase motif. The intervening sequences are inserted into the same sites as has been described in other Saccharomyces, especially more than 100 strains of S. cerevisiae11,19,20,21,52 (Fig. 3). However, a detailed analysis indicates that the insertion site for cox1I3a should be shifted to position 242. Position 243 would generate lysine instead of an asparagine residue in the GGFGN section in both S. arboricolus molecules. This motif is conserved across the tree of life from yeast to humans. G-G-F-G-N-[WY]-[FL]-[MV] is a part of the well-recognized water membrane interface motif in cytochrome c and quinol oxidases (MeMotif—http://projects.biotec.tu-dresden.de/memotif).53Occurrence of introns and free-standing ORFs. Introns and free-standing ORFs with at least one motif characteristic for the homing endonucleases (LAGLIDADG, GIY-YIG, etc.) are in black; without reading frame are white; with truncated ORF interrupted by stop codon are spotted.

Only ORFs containing at least one endonuclease/maturase motif were considered.A number of introns also contain ORFs in phase with the upstream exon, sometimes interrupted by a frame-shift stop codon, often due to the insertion of GC clusters. Only those possessing at least one motif characteristic for the HE (LAGLIDADG, GIY-YIG, etc.) were considered as potentially active54,55 (Fig. 3).However, there are two exceptions: cox1I5ß and cobI1a, where an ORF coding for a nuclease/maturase motif is not fused to the upstream exon. cox1I5ß is not known as mobile and the splicing requires at least five different nuclei-coded factors and an ORF from cobI3.6,56 The reason is that the 3' splice site lies unusually far from the catalytic core of the intron; therefore, the ORF 357 amino acids (AA) long containing two LAGLIDADG motifs in the S288c strain was not considered as potentially active.56 But a recent S. cerevisiae mitochondrial transcriptome study revealed an alternative splice site that puts the cox1I5ß ORF in frame with the upstream exon.57 We found the same ACTTATTATATATT consensus of the alternative splice site in several other Saccharomyces species (S. mikatae, S. cariocanus, S. bayanus, S. uvarum, S. pastorianus strains and S. eubayanus and S. paradoxus CBS 432; Fig. 4A).

Arrows mark exons–introns boundaries. Consensus of alternative splice site as described in reference57 and hypothetical alternative splice site in cobI1a are underlined.Perhaps, a similar mechanism can be used in cobI1a. We found a hypothetical alternative splice site sharing sequence similarity AAATATTAG(G/A)T(A/T)AATTTA allowing the translation of an intron reading frame with an upstream exon (Fig. 4B). In S. cariocanus, S. pastorianus, S. mikatae and S. eubayanus it contains a 169–297 AA-long reading frame with one GIY-YIG endonuclease maturase motif.58Introns, especially those containing HEs, represent a class of mobile elements spread horizontally into an intron-less allele by ‘homing’. They can be found in different species in the same position of the same gene in a chain-involved cyclical gain and loss.19,59,60 Consequently, they are randomly distributed among the different species.19,20 However, there are a few remarkable exceptions. Intron cox1I3ß has not been found in S. cerevisiae although more than a hundred strains have been sequenced. Besides both S. arboricolus strains, cox1I3ß is present in all other Saccharomyces species.19–21 Other evidence of uneven cox1I3ß distribution comes from S. cerevisiae xenomitochondrial cybrids containing S. paradoxus mtDNA. They exhibit a slower growth rate on a non-fermentable carbon source, decreased respiration capacity and reduced cytochrome aa3 content associated with the inefficient splicing of cox1I3ß.22 Apparently, the occurrence of cox1I3ß is related to Dobzhansky–Muller nuclear incompatibilities in nucleo-mitochondrial communication that may result in the divergence of yeast species.22Very rare is the orphan cox1I4<U+03B3> intron that occurs only in S. bayanus CBS 380 and S. uvarum CBS 395. We were unable to find homologs in spite of extensive search in the literature and databases.19 Also, cox1I4a, well known as coding for HE I-Scell with a LAGLIDADG motif,61 was not identified in any other Saccharomyces but S. cerevisiae. Unlike cox1I4<U+03B3> it can be found in less related species from the Saccharomyces/Kluyveromyces complex Naumovia castellii62 and Kluyveromyces marxianus species.19,63Intron homing is catalyzed by HEs64,65 that have different evolutionary history and can exist alone.66,67 Such free-standing ‘endonucleases’, named ORFs,29 have already been described in S. cerevisiae and S. pastorianus mtDNA, but their occurrence is strain dependent.6,29,ORF1 orthologs are most frequent in different Saccharomyces species (Fig. 3). They code for one or two LAGLIDADG motifs and a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domain.68 Because of the number of stop codons or a GC cluster insertion ORF2 is present mostly in truncated form.19,21 A reading frame coding for one LAGLIDADG motif was found only in S. cariocanus. We were unable to detect ORF3 in any ‘non-cerevisiae’ Saccharomyces. Apparently this dubious ORF does not encode a functional protein. Full size ORF4 can be found in S. cerevisiae and S. arboricolus. Among all previously identified small ORFs, regions with significant homology to ORF56 were found only in S. paradoxus11 and S. cariocanus. Therefore, ORF5 is considered as a probable genomic artifact,69 although very small proteins coded by mtDNA are expected, since at least two small proteins were reported to be coded by rns in mammalian mitochondria.70,713.3. Intergenic DNA, GC clusters and origins of replicationThe putative origins of replication in S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus are ~270 bp in length and contain GC blocks separated by AT-rich stretches.6,72 According to novel bioinformatics analysis (strain S288c) it is a five-part consensus sequence [GGGGGAGGGGGTGGGTGAT ~200 A/T-rich GGGTCCC 29 A/T-rich GGGACC] downstream of the 20-base promoter [DDWDWTAWAAGT<U+2193>ARTADDDD].57,Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtDNA contains seven or eight ori elements, depending on the strain, but only ori 2, 3 and 5 are active. They contain a transcription initiation site adjacent to the five-part consensus sequence providing a contiguous transcript of >350 nucleotides. The other ori sites are disabled by the insertion of a G-class GC cluster CCCGGTTTCTTACGAAACCGGGACCTCGGAGA(C/A)GT into the promoter site.57,73 The ori elements are present in all Saccharomyces species. Their number decreases with the phylogenetic distance from S. cerevisiae as the S. paradoxus species possesses eight, but species from the lager beer species/S. uvarum clade only four (Table 3). All of them can be potentially active as they are adjacent to the hypothetical promoter sequence DDWDWTAWAAGT<U+2193>ARTADDDD57 (Supplementary Material S4A). Replication origins and GC clustersaori2 considered as active is absent; G, V, M1, M1', M2, M2', M2"", M3 and M4 are GC cluster classes identified according to consensus described in detail in reference20 with various degrees of degeneration (Supplementary Material S3C); U—unclassified GC clusters defined as longer than = 20 nt with GC content = 40%; SpS—species-specific GC clusters found in the S. bayanus, S. uvarum, S. pastorianus clade consensus sequence TCGTNWCGYACCGTCCAATWGGACGGTACG and in S. arboricolus GGGGTCCC N(28–30) GGGGTCCC.

Strains assembled in this work are marked in bold.GC clusters were originally defined as regions 35 bp long on average and 45–62% GC74 and are in general the major source of noticeable intergenic region polymorphism.6 According to the characteristic primary structures, they have been assigned to seven families which exhibit varying degrees of homology.73,74 Recently, the M2"" class consensus was reduced to 14 bases (TCCGGCCGAAGGAG).20 Therefore, we took into consideration as GC clusters only regions longer than = 20 nt with GC content = 40%. The average number of GC clusters in S. cerevisiae is above 100 and their occurrence decreases in other Saccharomyces species20 from 90 to 30 (Table 3). A G-class ori-specific GC cluster has been found in any species from the S. bayanus, S. uvarum, S. pastorianus clade, but remote from ori. The most frequent are M1 and M2 classes, although members of other classes can be found. In addition, a species-specific GC-rich sequence (GGGGTCCC N(28–30) GGGGTCCC) was recognized in both S. arboricolus strains and a GC cluster with the consensus TCGTNWCGYACCGTCCAATWGGACGGTACG in species from the lager beer species/S. uvarum clade.3.4. Transcription units and adjacent motifsThe highly-conserved sequence motif WTATAAGTA is known as the yeast mitochondrial transcription initiation site.6,75–77 Recently, transcriptome analysis confirmed experimentally the sequence DDWDWTAWAAGT<U+2193>ARTADDDD as the consensus promoter site in S. cerevisiae57 and 19 potential transcription initiation sites6 were reduced to 11. We found these consensus promoter sites in all sequenced Saccharomyces at approximately the same position as they were reported for S. cerevisiae. Because of the rearrangement of the trnS1-rps3 block in the mtDNA of the S. bayanus, S. uvarum, S. pastorianus clade, an additional transcription site was found upstream of the trnS1 gene (Supplementary Material S4A). When all hypothetical promoter sites are compared, the S. cerevisiae consensus57 is slightly degenerated mainly at the 5' site to DNNDNTAWAAGT<U+2193>ARTADDDD that is more related to the original nonanucleotide WTATAAGTA in spite of the phage T7 origin of yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Apparently, the 23 base-long phage T7 consensus promoter is reduced in Saccharomyces mtDNA.The 3' termini of mitochondrial mRNA cleavage sites in budding yeast are recognized according to the postulated dodecamer motif 5'-AAUAA (U/C) AUUCUU-3' in the 3' UTR region.77–79 A processing site was confirmed by transcriptome analysis where an alternative heptakaidecamer 5'AATAATATTCTTAT<U+2193>AGTCCGGCC<U+2193>CGCCC with part of the M2 GC cluster is recognized instead.57 Variations to the dodecamer have been found in all protein-coding transcription units at the 3' UTR region of all Saccharomyces species, in most cases up to 200 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon (Supplementary Material S4B). A putative atp8 transcription termination site exhibits the most degenerated consensus sequence. Interesting features are the multiple cleavage sites for ORF1 present in S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii and S. arboricolus. An alternative heptakaidecamer transcription processing site was found only in S. cerevisiae.3.5. Gene order and syntenyThe most profound feature is the alteration in gene order that involves mainly trnfM-rnpB-trnP, rns-trnW, trnE-cob and trnS1-rps3 gene clusters. S. cerevisiae NRRL Y-12632 mtDNA with a length of almost 90 kb belongs among the largest genomes and has the same gene order as is known in 105 other strains.20,21,S. paradoxus CBS 2908 and CBS 7400 mtDNA differs in size (66 kb versus 71 kb), associated with the intron occurrence in the cob gene. The gene order is the same as in 14 other strains.11,19 They differ from S. cerevisiae by the excision of the trnFT1V-cox3-trnfM-rnpB-trnP-rns-trnW segment that is translocated behind the trnS1-rps3 gene cluster where rns-trnW is inverted (Figs 1 and 5). Surprisingly, the 77 kb mtDNA of S. cariocanus is syntenic to S. cerevisiae, although these species can be distinguished according to the cox1I3ß intron present in S. cariocanus (Figs 1 and 3). S. mikatae mtDNA is >85 kb long and the gene architecture is altered from S. cerevisiae by the movement and inversion of the trnfM-rnpB-trnP gene cluster behind the rns-trnW locus (Fig. 5). S. kudriavzevii mtDNA is ~80 kb long and the gene order differs from S. cerevisiae by the excision of rns-trnW and its transplacement to the complementary strand at the 3' end of the trnS1-rps3 gene cluster (Fig. 5). Both S. arboricolus mtDNAs are around 70 kb in size and the genome architecture exhibits very extensive reshuffling in relation to S. cerevisiae. The rns-trnW cluster is excised and transferred at the 3' end of the atp9-trnS1-rps3 gene cluster. The remaining trnfM-rnpB-trnP-cox1-atp8-atp6 genome segment is translocated at the end of the cob gene (Figs 1 and 5). S. bayanus, S. eubayanus, S. uvarum and S. pastorianus share the same mtDNA architecture. Besides all alterations known for S. arboricolus the characteristic transcription unit atp9-trnS1-rps3 is broken and the trnS1-rps3 part is inverted at the same location (Figs 1 and 5). Strains from the lager beer species/S. uvarum clade despite their hybrid nature are classified as separate species, although they exhibit strikingly similar mtDNA sequences. Nearly identical are mtDNAs from S. uvarum CBS 395T and S. bayanus CBS 380T.  Comparison of mitochondrial gene order in Saccharomyces.

Individual gene clusters are highlighted by different shades of grey. Pentagon symbols indicate the transcription direction.The alteration in gene order within yeast genera is not so frequent and is associated with the genome size. The majority of yeast mtDNA is relatively small (< 40 kbp) with the genes located on the same strand. The size of <15% of mtDNA exceeds 50 kb and the genes are scattered in conserved blocks (e.g. cox1-atp8-atp6, rnl-trn) coded in both strands with altered transcription orientation.7 Obviously, larger genomes like in Saccharomyces are more prone to rearrangements. An extremely high degree of gene conservation and synteny is the characteristic feature among and within the species possessing smaller mtDNA of the Lachancea,80,Torulaspora81 and Yarrowia clades.82 However, significant mitochondrial genome rearrangement was observed in yeasts with larger mtDNA from the Nakaseomyces83 and Dekkera/Brettanomyces genera.84 Apparently, alteration in mtDNA gene order depends most of all on the size of intergenic regions and is obvious if their ratio to genes exceeds 60%.7 The gene order alteration mechanism was deduced exclusively from the DNA sequence, proposing an intermediate with duplicate segments, associated with conserved gene blocks mimicking transcription units.11,84,85 This is not the case in S. bayanus, S. eubayanus, S. uvarum and S. pastorianus where the atp9-trnS1-rps3 transcription unit is broken apart and the transposition of trnS1-rps3 to the opposite strand requires formation of a de novo promoter.3.6. Phylogeny and taxonomyAs mentioned above, currently S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, S. arboricolus, S. bayanus, S. uvarum and S. pastorianus are the only species accepted by taxonomists as Saccharomyces.1 However, whole (nuclear) genome studies demonstrated that S. pastorianus is an alloploid of S. cerevisiae and the newly described species S. eubayanus as well as S. bayanus is a hybrid between S. uvarum and S. eubayanus with a small contribution of S. cerevisiae.4,5,13,26,86,Saccharomyces cariocanus is reproductively isolated by four chromosomal translocations from S. paradoxus but not by sequence and therefore is considered to be a S. paradoxus subspecies.4,5,86 All these data came exclusively from nuclear genetic information, although mitochondrial genomes are more susceptible to mutations than their nuclear counterparts.The accuracy of taxonomic classification as well as the evolution history can be inferred from phylogenetic trees derived from concatenated DNA or protein sequences of mitochondrial or nuclear origin. However, support for many lineages in present phylogenetic trees is often weak and more robust analyses of relationships will require whole genome comparisons.87 To shed light on these taxonomy–phylogeny pitfalls we constructed phylogenetic trees from unambiguously aligned portions of the concatenated mtDNA sequences coding for proteins (Fig. 6A). Because of limited gene availability, we used 10 nuclear genes as a good compromise, especially if they had been used in population studies36–39 (Fig. 6B). Branching in both trees does not correlate with basic taxonomic classification and the tree derived from the combined sequences of the D1/D2 LSU RNA gene and ITS used in taxonomy1 (Fig. 6). Phylogenetic comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear genes clearly demonstrates that S. cariocanus should be assigned as a separate species. It belongs in the nuclei-derived tree to the S. paradoxus clade; however, in the mitochondrial tree it forms a statistically significant separate branch. Considering its mtDNA gene order, which differs from that of S. paradoxus, and the presence of the cox1I3ß intron, S. cariocanus should be designated as a separate species (Fig. 6). This conclusion, rather than horizontal transfer, supports the low spore viability obtained from crosses with the S. paradoxus tester as well as the absence of any S. cerevisiae genes in the nuclear genome.4,5,86 Multilocus phylogenies based on conserved mitochondrial genes (except extremely variable rps3) are largely representative; however, they occasionally do not correlate with trees derived from nuclear genes.7,84 The most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is different selection pressures for mitochondrial and nuclear genes, where complex patterns of hybridization and introgression are involved.7,84 However, the S. cariocanus paradox can be also explained as a partially developing divergence, because the genus Saccharomyces is considered as a continuum of taxa differentiating towards speciation.1Saccharomyces phylogeny. Both trees were constructed from unambiguously aligned concatenated DNA sequences using the Maximum likelihood phylogeny PhyML program. (A) mtDNA-derived phylogeny from DNA sequences coding for proteins in the order cox1, atp8, atp6, cob, atp9, cox2, cox3. (B) Nuclear DNA-derived phylogenetic tree from CCA1, CYT1, MLS1, RPS5, LAS1, MET4, NUP116, ZDS2, PDR10 and DSN1 protein-coding genes used in population studies.36–39 The branch length is proportional to the nucleotide differences indicated by the bar. The numbers given at the nodes are the frequencies of a given branch appearing in 1,000 bootstrap replications. All are above 50%, indicating good statistical support.

Naumovia castellii NRRL Y-12630 was used as an outgroup.Even more complicated relationships are found among the hybrid species from the lager beer species/S. uvarum clade (Fig. 6). It consists historically of two species associated with human activities. S. pastorianus is a typical bottom lager beer yeast and S. bayanus (CBS 380) was isolated from turbid beer. Only S. uvarum (CBS 395) was isolated from natural substrate (blackcurrant).26 The origin of S. pastorianus was studied in detail and has been elucidated by the discovery of a new species S. eubayanus.5 All modern S. pastorianus are aneuploid descendants of a tetraploid S. eubayanus/S. cerevisiae hybrid (2n, 2n) with limited loss of contribution from either parent.4,5,13,88 Apparently, the S. pastorianus strain sequenced in this work as well as a number of other strains inherited mtDNA exclusively from S. eubayanus mtDNA.13,89 The systematics of S. bayanus and S. uvarum has been confusing and controversial for decades. S. uvarum (S. bayanus var. uvarum) strains represent a nearly pure lineage that contains very little genetic input from other Saccharomyces species although type strain CBS 395 does not produce viable spores and sequencing revealed that the strain is aneuploid.26 However, a number of different strains (including CBS 7001 ‘genomic type strain’) are good sporulants and introgression from other Saccharomyces species is low.4,90,S. bayanus is not a ‘species’ in an evolutionary sense and should be rather understood as a product of the artificial brewing environment with no occurrence in nature. Therefore, all known strains of S. bayanus (including the type strain CBS 380) are hybrids of S. eubayanus and S. uvarum that contain contributions from S. cerevisiae in at least some cases.26 Comparison of mtDNA clearly demonstrates its S. uvarum origin in S. bayanus CBS 380. A similar conclusion was reported by91 when they compared part of the cox2 gene in the collection of S. eubayanus and its interspecies hybrids. A model of S. bayanus formation involves multiple hybridization events of S. pastorianus with wild strains of S. uvarum. In the case of S. bayanus CBS 380 it happened only recently as mtDNA from S. uvarum CBS 395T and S. bayanus CBS 380T is nearly identical. They only differ in four substitutions and five indels of which one is the insertion of a GC cluster and one a TTATTTAC repeat. Therefore, comparison of mtDNA should not be neglected in genomic studies as it is an important tool to understand the origin and evolutionary history of some yeast species.4. ConclusionsWe sequenced mtDNA from a variety of Saccharomyces species by Illumina MiSeq. All are circularly mapped molecules decreasing in size with phylogenetic distance from S. cerevisiae but with similar gene content including regulatory and selfish elements like origins of replication, introns, free-standing ORFs or GC clusters. Their most profound feature is species-specific alteration in gene order, apparently accompanying the speciation process in yeasts with larger mtDNA. Conserved mtDNA gene order seems to be a species-specific feature as pointed out by the comparison of more than 100 S. cerevisiae strains20,21 and ~15 S. paradoxus strains19 as well as 50 strains from Lachancea thermotolerans.80 On the other hand, reshuffling of mitochondrial genes evidently accompanies the yeast speciation process if mitochondrial genomes are large enough.7 The genetic code differs from well-known yeast mitochondrial code as GUG is used as the translation start in the S. cariocanus cox3 gene as well as in some free-standing ORF1. Arginine CGA and CGC codons considered as unassigned are present in maturases/HE coded by introns. Because of the alternative splicing of cox1I5ß and cobI1a, AUA considered as an initiation codon is absent. The multilocus phylogeny, inferred from mtDNA, does not correlate with the trees derived from nuclear genes. mtDNA data demonstrate that S. cariocanus should be assigned as a separate species and S. bayanus CBS 380 should not be considered as a distinct species due to mtDNA nearly identical to S. uvarum mtDNA. Apparently, comparison of mtDNAs should be included in genomic studies, as it is an important tool to understand the origin and evolutionary history of some yeast species.The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

IntroductionSequencing technologies have substantially advanced the study of cancer genomics. Large-scale studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)1 and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)2, have generated catalogs of various types of mutations in cancer cells, and this information is currently an invaluable resource for various purposes. In particular, these data collections provide critical information that can be used to identify the driver mutations in each cancer patient and inform initial therapeutic approaches, including molecular-targeted anti-cancer drugs. For example, several effective anti-cancer drugs are available for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib have been used to treat EGFR-mutant tumors,3 while crizotinib and other ALK-kinase inhibitors can be a highly effective therapy for ALK-fusion positive patients.4,5 To determine whether these drugs should be administered, it is necessary to sequence the cancer nucleic acids and identify the driver mutation in each case. However, sequencing is limited by the following disadvantages: a large and very expensive instrument is needed; short-read sequencing occasionally overlooks the allelic background of the cancer mutations; and structural aberrations, such as fusion genes and splicing alterations, are typically difficult to detect.MinION, which is a recently developed portable, disposable long-read sequencer,6 has the potential to address the drawbacks of the currently used cancer genome sequencing technologies. MinION is USB-sized and can be operated on a laptop PC. The template preparation takes only 2–3 h and does not require any specific experimental skills. In less than 48 h, hundreds of thousands of reads can be obtained, which are occasionally longer than 10 kb. Recent studies have applied MinION for several purposes focusing primarily on the detection and genotyping of pathogens. For example, one study reported the antibiotic genomic regions in Salmonella strains.7 In a more clinical setting, real-time sequencing using MinION and a phylogenic analysis of the obtained sequences revealed Salmonella outbreaks in a hospital.8 More recently, the first field application of MinION was used to diagnose the lethal virus Ebola in Africa.9 However, an analysis of genomic mutations in cancers using MinION has not been reported, except for a few pioneering studies.10,11 To the best of our knowledge, the application of MinION for the identification and characterization of various genomic aberrations in cancer cells remains elusive.In this study, we assessed the ability of MinION sequencing technology to characterize various types of cancer mutations. We sequenced cDNA amplicons from cancer-related genes and detected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in EGFR, KRAS and NRAS; a short deletion in EGFR; aberrantly spliced RNAs in NF1; and CCDC6-RET, EML4-ALK, and other gene fusion transcripts in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.12 The phasing of the allelic information of the mutations was also examined using the long-read sequencing capability of MinION. We used cell lines as a model to apply a simple sequencing method to clinical cancer genomes.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell linesThe lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-9, LC2/ad, PC-7, RERF-LC-Ad2, H1437, H1975, H2228, H2347, A549 and H322 were used in this study (Supplementary Table S1) and have been previously described.12 Total RNA was extracted from frozen cancer cell pellets using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen). The total RNA was assessed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent), and the total RNA samples satisfied an RNA Integrity Number (RIN)>9. For the H1975 and A549 cell lines, the genomic DNA was extracted from 1 × 107 cell pellets using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The extracted genomic DNA was eluted into 200 µl Buffer AE.2.2. Clinical samplesThe RNA samples were obtained from eight Japanese lung adenocarcinoma patients after obtaining their appreciated informed consent and the institutional review at the National Cancer Center Japan. The total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as previously reported.13 The RNA was assessed using an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent). All samples satisfied RIN > 7.2.3. RT-PCRPrior to the cDNA synthesis, the total RNA (approximately 10 µg from the cell lines and 500 ng from the clinical samples) was treated with DNase I (Takara) in a buffer containing 8 mM MgCl2, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT and RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega) for 10 min at 37 °C. After the phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation for RNA purification, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in First-Strand buffer with 0.8 mM dNTPs, 12 mM DTT, 2.5 µl dT primer (5’-GCGGCTGAAGACGGCCTATGTGGCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3’, 10 pmol/µl) and RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega) at 42 °C overnight. After the phenol-chloroform extraction of 100 µl cDNA sample, 2 µl 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 15 µl 0.1 M NaOH were added. The samples were incubated at 65 °C for 40 min, and 20 µl 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0–7.5) were added to the sample. After the ethanol precipitation, the samples were dissolved in =50 µl (for cell lines) or 20 µl (for clinical samples) H2O. The cDNA samples were PCR amplified using 1 cycle of 30 s at 98 °C; 40 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 5 min at 72 °C; and a final 10 min cycle at 72 °C. For the PCR reaction, 25 µl 2× Phusion Master Mix (Finnzymes), 16-19 µl H2O and 5 µl 5 µM forward and reverse primers were added to 1–4 µl cDNA template. For the EGFR analysis in the clinical samples (EGFR-iii), a second (nested) PCR was conducted with 1/10-diluted PCR products using 1 cycle of 30 s at 98 °C; 30 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 5 min at 72 °C; and a final 10 min cycle at 72 °C. The PCR primers and expected product lengths are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2A. The primers were designed using Primer3plus.14 After the PCR reaction, the amplicons were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).2.4. PCR of EGFR using genomic DNAsFor the PCR reaction, 1µl genomic DNA templates were mixed with 25 µl 2× Phusion Master Mix (Finnzymes), 19 µl nuclease-free water, 2.5 µl forward primer (10 µM) and 2.5 µl reverse primer (10 µM). The mixed samples were amplified using 1 cycle of 40 s at 98 °C; 40 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and 1 min at 72 °C; and a final 10 min cycle at 72 °C. The PCR primers are shown in Supplementary Table S2B.2.5. MinION library preparation for the cell linesUsing a mixture of cDNA amplicons, MinION sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nanopore Sequencing Kit (SQK-MAP005, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In total, 1 µg cDNA amplicons were prepared in 80 µl nuclease-free water and 5 µl DNA CS were added to the template. For the end-repair, the template was incubated at 20 °C for 20 min with 10 µl End-repair buffer and 5 µl End-repair enzyme mix (NEBNext End Repair Module, New England Biolabs). The template was purified using 100 µl Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and eluted into 25 µl H2O. To perform the dA tailing, 3 µl dA-tailing buffer and 2 µl dA-tailing enzyme (NEBNext dA-Taling Module) were added to the end-repaired DNA. The template was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, purified by AMPure XP beads and eluted to 30 µl nuclease-free water. For the adapter ligation, the template was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 10 µl Adapter Mix, 10 µl HP Adapter and 50 µl Blunt/TA adapter Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs). In total, 10 µl His-Tag beads (Dynabeads His-Tag Isolation and Pulldown, Life Technologies) were washed twice and resuspended with the Bead Binding Buffer. After the ligation, the adapter-ligated DNA was purified using the washed His-Tag beads and eluted in 25 µl Elution Buffer (‘pre-sequencing mix’). Before the sample loading, 325 µl priming buffer were mixed with 6.5 µl Fuel Mix, 162.5 µl 2× Running Buffer and 156 µl H2O. To prime the MinION R7.3 flow cell (FLO-MAP003, Oxford Nanopore technologies), 150 µl of the priming buffer were loaded twice with a 10-min waiting period before each loading. After preparing the flow cell, 75 µl 2× Running Buffer, 66 µl H2O, 3 µl Fuel Mix and 6 µl pre-sequencing mix were mixed, and then 150 µl of the resulting MinION sequencing library were loaded into the flow cell.2.6. MinION library preparation for the clinical samples and dilution seriesThe Nanopore Sequencing Kit SQK-MAP006 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used for the library preparation for the clinical samples and dilution series. Using a cDNA template (approximately 1 µg in 45 µl), 5 µl DNA CS were added. To perform the end-repair and dA tailing, 7 µl End-Prep buffer and 3 µl End-Prep enzyme mix (NEBNext Ultra II End-Repair/dA-tailing Module, New England Biolabs) were added. The template was incubated at 20 °C for 5 min and 65 °C for 5 min and was then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). For the adapter ligation, 8 µl H2O, 10 µl Adapter Mix, 2 µl HP Adapter and 50 µl Blunt/TA adapter Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs) were added to the 30 µl DNA template. After incubating for 10 min at room temperature, 1 µl HP tether was added. The template was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. During the ligation, Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Life Technologies) were washed twice and suspended with 100 µl Bead Binding Buffer. After the ligation, the adapter-ligated DNA samples were purified using the washed beads and eluted using 25 µl Elution Buffer, followed by an incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. The eluted DNA sample was called the ‘pre-sequencing mix.’ Before loading the library, a mixture was prepared with 26.6 µl Fuel Mix, 500 µl 2× Running Buffer and 473.4 µl H2O. To prime the MinION R7.3 flow cell (FLO-MAP103, Oxford Nanopore Technologies), 500 µl of the mixture were loaded twice with a waiting period of 10 min before each loading. After preparing the flow cell, the MinION sequencing library was prepared with 75 µl 2× Running Buffer, 65 µl H2O, 4 µl Fuel Mix and 6 µl pre-sequencing mix and loaded to the flow cell.2.7. MinION sequencingSequencing was performed for 48 h using MinKNOW. After the sequencing, base calling (2D Basecalling v1.24, SQK-MAP005 v1.34, SQK-MAP006 v1.62 and SQK-MAP006 v1.69) was performed via the ONT Metrichor (https://metrichor.com/s/index.shtml).2.8. Alignment of MinION sequencing data of cDNA ampliconsThe fastq files for the template, complement or 2D reads were converted from fast5 files using poretools version 0.5.1.15 Both ‘pass’ and ‘fail’ reads were used in this study. To compare the yield and qualities of the reads under different alignment conditions, LAST (version 658).16 and BWA (version 0.7.12-r1039).17 were used with the following sets of parameters; 1) BWA in ont2d mode; 2) LAST with the default parameter; 3) LAST with a match score of 1 (-r1), mismatch cost of 1 (-q1), gap existence cost of 1 (-a1) and gap extension cost of 1 (-b1); and 4) LAST with a gap existence cost of 12 (-a12), insertion existence cost of 15 (-A15), gap extension cost of 4 (-b4) and insertion extension cost of 4 (-B4) as determined according to the last-train.18 LAST uses the fastq quality data (with -Q1) to obtain more accurate alignments.19 The gap costs correspond to a statistical model of the specific probabilities of opening and extending insertions and deletions. The last-train determines the probabilities (and therefore costs) that fit the given sequence data. In these data, insertions are rarer than deletions; thus, their cost is higher.Using LAST with the parameters -a12, -A15, -b4 and -B4, all 2D reads were mapped onto the 32,104 reference mRNA sequences based on the annotation file (refGene.txt) distributed by the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/).20 The alignments with the best score in each query were extracted and used for further analysis. When the scores were identical for two hits, the first hit was selected. When the read was aligned to different isoforms of the same gene with identical scores, the representative isoform was prioritized (representative isoforms selected were NM_005528 in EGFR, NM_004985 in KRAS, NM_002524 in NRAS, NM_000267 in NF1, NM_019063 in EML4, NM_020630 in RET, NM_000855 in GUCY1A2, NM_025202 in EFHD1, NM_004198 in CHRNA6 and NM_022464 in SIL1 according to Illumina RNA-Seq data previously published in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under the accession number DRA00184612).2.9. Alignment of MinION sequencing data of genomic DNA ampliconsUsing LAST (version 658) with the parameters -a13, -A14, -b4 and -B3 which were determined by the last-train, all 2D reads were mapped onto chromosome 7 of the human genome UCSC hg38. The best alignments in each query were determined using last-split.2.10. Detection of SNVsUsing the MinION reads, SNVs were detected as follows: 1) the reads aligned to the EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and NF1 target regions were extracted; 2) at each position, the depths of each base context were calculated considering only reads without errors ±3 bp of that position, and consensus sequences were constructed; 3) the consensus sequences were compared with the reference sequences and the SNVs were detected; and 4) the SNV candidates were verified using the Illumina whole-genome sequencing and RNA-Seq data obtained from the DDBJ under the accession numbers DRA001859 and DRA001846.12Consensus sequences for the MinION reads were constructed as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 (step2). Positions with a read depth of less than 100 were defined as ‘Low depth.’ Positions in which the types of bases could not be determined were defined as ‘Unknown.’ A base (A, T, G or C) in a given position was called if the number of supporting reads for that base was more than twice the sum of the other bases. For heterozygous sites, a second base was similarly defined. Reads without mismatches ±3 bp of the same position were used.To verify the SNVs detected by the MinION consensus, the SNVs were also identified using the Illumina RNA-Seq data.12 The RNA-Seq data were mapped onto the human reference genome (UCSC hg19) using GSNAP.21 By scanning all the EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and NF1 target regions, 41 SNVs (variant allele frequency >10%) were detected as a validation dataset. Among the 41 true SNVs, 39 SNVs harboring sufficient depths in the MinION reads were considered true positives.2.11. Detection of deletions and aberrant splicingTo detect short deletions in EGFR, the deletion depths were considered as the consensus sequences were constructed. The deletions were detected similarly to the SNV detection. After comparing to a known driver EGFR deletion, the false positive detections were removed. For aberrant NF1 exon skipping, the reads aligned to NF1 were re-aligned by split alignment using LAST. After calculating the depth of the split alignment, NF1 skipping was observed as site with no or few aligned reads.2.12. Analysis of fusion transcriptsTo detect the fusion transcripts and junction points in the MinION reads, the MinION reads were aligned to 32,104 reference mRNA sequences with split alignment22 using LAST (with the -m1 option to allow for multiple hits). Reads split between two different genes were extracted and counted. Gene pairs supported by more than 100 split reads were defined as fusion transcripts. A position at which the depth most significantly changed was considered a potential junction point. The junction points of known driver fusion transcripts (ALK and RET fusion transcripts) have been confirmed in previous studies.23–25To assess the alignment accuracy and confirm the junction points, the MinION reads were also aligned to fused RNA sequences using LAST with the trained parameters described above. In addition, the MinION reads were aligned to 32,104 reference mRNA sequences to avoid a misalignment.2.13.PhasingTo phase the two EGFR mutations (T790M and L858R) in the H1975 cells, the reads completely covering the EGFR kinase domain were extracted. Reads without any mismatches ±3 bp at both mutation sites were used for the phasing. The reads with deletions at the mutation sites were removed from this analysis.2.14. EGFR dilution analysis for mutation detectionPCR amplicons of EGFR (EGFR-i, 3.4 kb) were prepared using cDNAs from H1975 (mutant) and RERF-LC-Ad2 (wild-type) cells. The H1975 amplicons were diluted with those from RERF-LC-Ad2 at the following ratios: 1:1, 1:4, 1:9, 1:19 and 1:99. The diluted samples were sequenced using MinION according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The MinION reads were processed for mutation phasing as described above.2.15. Validation using TA cloning and Sanger sequencingAll driver mutations and junction points in the fusion transcripts were validated by direct Sanger sequencing. The results of the mutation phasing of EGFR in H1975 and junction sequences of EML4-ALK in H2228 were validated with TA cloning using the pMD20-T vector (Mighty TA-Cloning Kit, #6028, Takara). The PCR and sequencing primers are listed in Supplementary Table S3.2.16. Data accessThe MinION sequencing data from the cell lines were deposited in the DDBJ under the accession numbers DRA004627 and DRA005767. The MinION sequencing data from the clinical samples were published in the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) and DDBJ in Japan with the accession number JGAS00000000065 under controlled access.3. Results3.1. Nanopore sequencing of cancer-related genesUsing MinION, which was provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), we sequenced the reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR products from four genes, i.e., EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and NF1, as representative oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in lung cancers (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; the primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table S2A).26–30 These genes represent various mutation patterns. Specifically, single base substitutions, short deletions and exon skipping have been reported in the EGFR, KRAS and NRAS genes; the EGFR gene; and the NF1 gene, respectively. We also analyzed the ALK and RET fusion transcripts and several novel fusion transcripts identified in previous Illumina RNA-Seq studies.12 (Supplementary Table S1). In total, 33 PCR products were sequenced. We divided these products into three pools and performed five MinION sequencing runs. In each run, an average of 47,306, 25,948 and 21,812 reads were obtained as ‘template,’ ‘complement’ and ‘2D’ reads, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). In the following analysis, we used a total of 109,060 2D reads from the five runs.As shown in Fig. 1A, the average read length was 1,835 bases. We expected that such generally long reads might sufficiently cover entire target regions, which ranged from 640 to 3,402 bases in length (see below). The base quality values (QV) were approximately 10.5 on average (Fig. 1B, statistics of the template and complement reads are also shown in Supplementary Fig. S3). We aligned the obtained reads to the reference human transcript sequences (32,104 transcripts; UCSC Genome Browser20). In the alignment, we compared two commonly used alignment programs BWA (ont2d mode)17 and LAST (with three sets of parameters).16 These programs were generally consistent with the aligned reads, although the target cover rates and sequence identities were dependent on the respective parameters (Supplementary Fig. S4, the parameters used in this analysis are shown in the Methods section and Supplementary Figure legends). Using LAST with the ‘trained’ parameters, on average 75% of the reads were aligned to the target mRNAs (Fig. 1C). Under these conditions, at least 150 reads were obtained for each of the bases in the target regions. For the EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and NF1 genes, the aligned reads showed 83% sequence identity on average, and 73% of the reads showed more than 80% sequence identity (Fig. 1D). We also examined the patterns of the sequencing errors. The error rates for the mismatches, deletions and insertions accounted for 7.3%, 7.8% and 2.5%, respectively, of the total error rate of 17% (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Cytosine or guanine bases were more likely to be miscalled. Deletions accumulated more at the homopolymer sites (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C). We also examined the length of each read that aligned to the target sequence. The results showed that on average, each read covered 82% of the target region, and 66% of the aligned reads covered more than 90% of the target regions, indicating that nearly the full-length of these amplicons was sequenced (Fig. 1E). These results suggested that the MinION reads obtained in this study are worthy for further analyses, such as mutation detection and phasing.

The average number is shown in the inset.3.2.Detection of SNVs and other types of cancerous mutationsIn the EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and NF1 genes, the expected types of mutations were detected, namely SNVs, short deletions and aberrantly spliced transcripts reflecting a splice site mutation. To detect the SNVs, we constructed consensus sequences for the MinION reads that were aligned to the target transcripts. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, an SNV was considered a possible homozygous SNV if the read count of a particular base (A, T, G or C) at a given position was larger than twice the sum of the other bases. We also considered possible heterozygous SNVs similarly using varying thresholds (see below; also see Supplementary Fig. S2). To further refine the detected SNVs, we only considered the reads with no mismatches in the ±3 bp region. This filter was useful, likely reflecting the base call scheme of MinION, based on ‘squiggle,’ a five-base window.For the detected SNVs, we validated the correct identification rates by comparing these variants with the RNA-Seq data from Illumina HiSeq. The indicated precision and recall rates of the called SNVs were determined according to the category (putative homo, heterozygous SNVs or ‘minor’ SNVs reflecting minor cancer cell numbers or mutant alleles in the population). The detection depended on the threshold of the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of the MinION reads, which is indicated as ‘X’ in Fig. 2A (also see Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Indeed, the sensitivity and precision of detecting the SNVs primarily depended on the extent of the coverage of the minor SNVs. SNVs with high variant allele frequencies (>75% in the Illumina RNA-Seq data), including homogeneous SNPs and mutations, were detected with high precision and recall rates (87.5% and 91.3%, respectively, when X = 0.9; blue line; Fig. 2A). However, the performance declined when minor SNPs (>50% or >10% in the Illumina RNA-Seq data) were also considered (precision and recall rates were 85.2% and 71.9%, respectively, when X = 0.5; orange line; 50.7% and 89.7%, respectively, when X = 0.3; black line; Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, the variant allele frequencies of the known heterozygous SNPs in the MinION reads were highly correlated with those in the Illumina RNA-Seq reads (Fig. 2C). Notably, most of the representative driver mutations, such as KRAS G12S in the A549 cells and NRAS Q61R in the H2347 cells (Fig. 2B), were detected. Detection of SNPs and mutations in the MinION reads. (A) Precision and recall rates of SNV detection using MinION. Blue, orange and black lines represent three datasets of SNVs corresponding to different variant allele frequencies (VAF) of Illumina standards, which are more than 75% (targets are only homozygous variants), 50% (targets include heterozygous variants) and 10% (targets include minor population variant). ‘X’ represents one of the parameters for the SNV detection, which is the threshold of the VAFs of the MinION reads.

The exon skipping in the Illumina RNA-Seq data is also shown in the lower panel.We further examined the patterns in the false SNV detection. For example, one SNP in the 3’ UTR of KRAS (c.*264C > T in A549 and H2228; rs4285970) was not detected using MinION. Upon further inspection, we observed that this SNP is sandwiched between a 4-base homopolymer GGGG and another 4-base homopolymer TTTT (Supplementary Fig. S6), and the deletions were called in most of the reads at this locus. In total, 521 false positive SNVs were called when the threshold ‘X’ (to 0.1) was lowered to consider the minor SNVs (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Among these false positive SNVs, nearly half were located within or adjacent to =3-base homopolymer sequences. In addition, more than 70% of the false positives were miscalls to a surrounding base (±1 bp) and/or C > G/G > C errors (Supplementary Fig. S7B and C). These results suggested that, for a more precise SNV detection, we should consider the presence of homopolymer sites in the surrounding regions. We also found that these errors could be decreased by examining longer matches of the surrounding bases (right, Supplementary Fig. S7C). A lower accuracy regarding homopolymers is one of the known problems with MinION sequencing. Base-callers occasionally call a wrong number of bases at homopolymer sites. Oxford Nanopore Technologies and several academic bioinformatics teams have been attempting to improve the accuracy by developing several options. Nanopolish (https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) is a software package for MinION data, which attempts to improve the read accuracy. One of the other options is a newly developed base-caller program, Scrappie. Using this program, a more precise estimation of the homopolymer lengths is enabled. Some other programs, which should be complementarily used for the original base-callers, are also under development. Indeed, the increasing noise-prone detection of SNVs with lower allelic frequencies is a concern that is not unique to MinION sequencing and is also an issue for Illumina sequencing, where one of the biggest advantages lies in its overwhelming sequencing depth. Further increasing the sequencing depth in MinION could, at least partially, address this issue.In addition to the SNVs, other types of mutations were also detected. The PC-9 cells harbored a 15-base deletion in EGFR that was covered by 943 reads without mismatches of ±3 bp (Fig. 2D). No mutant reads were detected in the RERF-LC-Ad2 cells, in which the EGFR gene is not mutated. The precise identification and mutant allele frequency were validated using Illumina RNA-Seq (lower panel, Fig. 2D). We could also detect aberrantly spliced transcripts. We observed irregular alignments in the sequence reads of the NF1 gene (NF1-ii) in the PC-7 cells that covered a portion of the target length, leaving a long gap in the transcript. We further re-aligned the 3,755 reads to NF1-ii to obtain a split alignment.22 As shown in Fig. 2E, the split alignment revealed that aberrant exon skipping occurred in exon 19, which eliminated 74 bases from this gene.These results showed that various categories of cancer mutations can be detected by MinION sequencing. All the driver aberrations were validated with Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S8). Additionally, we conducted MinION sequencing of genomic DNA amplicons of the EGFR gene (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Table S2). We could also detect mutations in genomic DNAs. However, the phasing analysis was challenging using the genomic DNA as a starting material because the mutations were occasionally separated by a long distance (e.g., 10.4 kb distance between EGFR T790M and L858R in the genome, Supplementary Fig. S9D). Particularly, it is practically very difficult or almost impossible to detect the fusion transcripts in the genomic DNA rather compared to the cDNA amplicons. The junction points of the fusion genes are frequently located in a large segment of an intron. PCR should cover very long DNA fragments that include such junction points when genomic DNA was used as the starting material. The detailed analysis of the mutation phasing and fusion genes are described in a later section. In summary, we could detect the driver mutations in the cell lines as follows: four somatic SNVs (KRAS G12S in A549; NRAS Q61R in H2347 and EGFR T790M/L858R in H1975) (Table 1), a deletion (EGFR E746_A750del in PC-9) and splice aberration (NF1 exon 19 skipping in PC-7), which have also been reported in a previous short-read sequencing study.12Summary of the driver mutations in the MinION sequencing dataBy only considering the positions of the 4 driver mutations described above, there were no false positive detections.TP, true positive; TN, true negative; Unk, unknown (false negative).Summary of the driver mutations in the MinION sequencing dataBy only considering the positions of the 4 driver mutations described above, there were no false positive detections.TP, true positive; TN, true negative; Unk, unknown (false negative).3.3. Sequencing junction points in fusion transcriptsWe also used MinION sequencing to identify fusion transcripts. First, we selected two representative oncogenic fusion transcripts, i.e., EML4-ALK in H2228 cells.25 and CCDC6-RET in LC2/ad cells.23,24 We designed PCR primers allowing for the resulting amplicon to sufficiently cover the potential junction points in the fusion transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S1). A split alignment to the sequence reads was conducted using LAST, which generated 540 and 341 reads bridging EML4-ALK and CCDC6-RET, respectively (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S7). We also sequenced five other fusion transcripts that were discovered in our previous RNA-Seq study of lung cancers12 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Using only the short reads, we could not obtain any information other than their junction points. Using the long reads in MinION, we could analyze their entire structures and obtain the phasing information of the junction points and the neighboring mutations/variations. More than 150 reads bridged the fusion partners in all cases (Supplementary Table S7). These reads accounted for 63%, on average, of the reads aligned to either of the fusion partners. We further re-aligned the MinION reads to the detected fusion transcript sequences (Supplementary Table S7). The aligned reads showed 82% sequence identity, and an average of 76% of the target regions were covered by the individual reads (Supplementary Fig. S10). Among these, more than 100 reads covered ±50 bases of the junction point of each of the fusion genes. Sequencing the fusion transcripts using the MinION reads.(A) Sequence depths of EML4-ALK and CCDC6-RET. The reads were split to both fusion partners with split alignment. (B) Allelic relevance between the SNP and the junction point of the EFHD1-UBR3 fusion transcript in the PC-9 cells. In the upper panel, the depths and base patterns of the MinION reads are shown in the EFHD1-UBR3 target region. The junction point is shown as a broken black line. One of the heterozygous SNPs in EFHD1, which is encircled with a red broken line and is referred to as G, co-occurred with the fusion junction in the MinION reads (left in the lower panel). This SNP was verified as heterozygous using Illumina RNA-Seq (right in the lower panel).Sequencing the fusion transcripts using the MinION reads.(A) Sequence depths of EML4-ALK and CCDC6-RET.

One of the heterozygous SNPs in EFHD1, which is encircled with a red broken line and is referred to as G, co-occurred with the fusion junction in the MinION reads (left in the lower panel). This SNP was verified as heterozygous using Illumina RNA-Seq (right in the lower panel).RNA-Seq and whole-genome Illumina sequencing data published by a previous study12 revealed that LC2/ad cells harbor a heterozygous SNP in CCDC6 near the junction point. This SNP was also detected as a homogeneous SNP using MinION, indicating that the gene fusion occurred in the same allele encoding this SNP. This SNP and the gene fusion appeared on the same Illumina reads because the distance between them was only seven bases; therefore, a particularly long MinION read was not necessary in this case. However, a heterozygous SNP (chr2:233498669, G/T) was identified in the fusion transcript EFHD1-UBR3 in PC-9 cells.12 In this case, the SNP was more than 300 bases from the fusion junction. The results of the MinION sequencing suggested that the gene fusion occurred at the G allele (reference allele of UCSC hg19) of this SNP. Such ‘phasing’ of multiple SNVs or SNVs with rearrangement points would be difficult using only Illumina short-read sequencing (Fig. 3B). All fusion junctions were validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S11).3.4. Phasing SNVs and evaluation of the detection limitsUsing the long-read sequencing of MinION, we attempted to phase multiple SNVs. We selected the targets as allelic associations of multiple SNVs, which should have direct clinical relevance such as sensitivity to the therapeutic anti-cancer drugs. The Illumina reads revealed that the H1975 cells harbored two mutations, i.e., T790M and L858R, in the EGFR kinase domain. While anti-cancer drugs targeting EGFR mutants, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective for the L858R mutation, the T790M secondary mutation on the same allele, if exists, would suppress the effect of the drugs.31 The Illumina sequencing also showed that both mutations were heterozygous SNVs, and we sought to determine whether these SNVs were in the same allele. The MinION sequencing revealed that 71% of the aligned reads (4089/5754 in EGFR-i) covered the kinase domain. We used 677 reads without mismatches ±3 bp at both sites. As shown in Fig. 4A, 72% of the reads harbored both mutations and 22% of the reads showed neither of the mutations. These results suggested that these mutations occurred in the same allele and that the remaining allele was not mutated. These results were also validated using TA cloning followed by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 4B). Small fractions of both the MinION and Sanger reads suggested additional very minor and complicated mutation patterns. Notably, we did not detect any other positions, particularly, in the protein kinase domain. A recently reported mutation, i.e., C797S, is known to render cancers resistant to the third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AZD9291, which is effective against cancers with double mutations at L858R and T790M.32 For the prognosis of a possible novel drug resistance, it should be of remarkable clinical relevance to monitor the acquisition of novel mutations, which may occasionally scatter over a wide region beyond the reach of Illumina sequencing, in an allele-specific manner. Phasing cancer mutations. (A) Phasing of the EGFR mutations T790M and L858R in H1975 cells. The number of MinION reads called for each of the SNV patterns.

(C) Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) in the five-point EGFR-mutant dilution series.

The VAFs in the wild-type and other patterns are also represented in pink and gray, respectively.Before initiating clinical applications of MinION sequencing, we further investigated whether mutations present at low levels could be detected and phased. This analysis was performed to ensure that the clinical requirements can be met if the cancer cell population is occasionally low in a clinical sample. Using serially diluted samples containing mixtures of the EGFR mutant (H1975) and wild-type (RERF-LC-Ad2) cell lines (mutant:wild type = 1:99, 1:19, 1:9, 1:4 and 1:1), we assessed the number of reads required to obtain sufficient mutant reads and determined the precision at which mutations can be detected and phased in the dilution series (Supplementary Table S8). The mutations with the respective frequencies could be detected and phased at almost the expected rates (Fig. 4C). Indeed, we found that several percent of the mutants were dropped in our dilution analysis. It may be still difficult to detect mutations in very minor population (less than several percent) using MinION. However, the sequencing yields and quality of the MinION data have been continuously increasing; therefore, this ‘drop’ problem, which is represented by the gray-colored area in Fig. 4C, will become less significant. Indeed, we found the error rates were significantly decreased in the newer version of the flow cell (R9). Using the R9 flow cell, 23,640 2D pass reads were aligned and the reads showed an average of 88.4% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. S12). More than 45% of the aligned reads harbored more than 90% sequence identity.3.5. Sequencing clinical samples using MinIONFinally, for clinical applications, we performed MinION sequencing using cDNA amplicons prepared from eight Japanese lung adenocarcinoma patients (Supplementary Fig. S13). Six patients harbored EGFR or KRAS mutations. To detect the driver mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes, we amplified target regions of approximately 1 kb that covered the mutational hotspot. Three patients harbored KRAS G12 mutations (G12V in one patient and G12C in two patients, Fig. 5A) and three other patients harbored deletions in exon 19 of EGFR (L747_T751del in two patients and L747_P753delinsS in one patient, Fig. 5B). These mutations were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S13). The variant allele frequencies were calculated by MinION using only reads without any mismatches in the 3-bp region surrounding the mutations, which is consistent with the cell line analysis. The results highly correlated with those obtained by the Sanger sequencing. Detection of driver alterations in clinical samples.

Using previously reported gene fusion variants as references, we determined that EML4-ALK is variant E18;A20,4,33 and KIF5B-RET is variant K23;R12.13 The precise detection of the junction points was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S13D). We also aligned the MinION reads to the fused transcripts to further examine the sequencing accuracy and junction coverage. The reads showed 84% sequence identity on average, and 79% and 69% of the reads, respectively, aligned to the ALK and RET fusions covered the junction points of these gene fusions (±50 bp, Supplementary Table S9A). We also compared the consensus sequences of the MinION reads with those of the Illumina RNA-Seq reads. The overall concordances were consistent with those obtained from the cell line analysis (Supplementary Table S9B).Furthermore, we conducted a phasing analysis of a short deletion and a heterozygous SNP in EGFR in one patient with EGFR mutations (Supplementary Fig. S14). In total, 88% of the reads showed two major patterns of allelic associations. Based on these results, we concluded that the precise detection of driver mutations by sequencing was also achieved using the clinical samples. The MinION sequencing data of the clinical samples are summarized in Table 2. Summary of the MinION sequencing data of clinical samplesaReads aligned to the fusion RNA were used in the calculations.Summary of the MinION sequencing data of clinical samplesaReads aligned to the fusion RNA were used in the calculations.4. DiscussionIn this study, we used a convenient, long-read MinION sequencer for mutation detection and phasing in cancers. We successfully applied the developed approach to identify cancerous mutations in first cultured cell models and then in clinical samples. Despite the error-prone nature of the sequence data of MinION, in the case of homozygous mutant alleles, the cancerous mutations could be robustly detected. We observed that the minor mutant alleles were occasionally difficult to detect depending on the allele frequency. The detection of such a minor mutant allele is often important for many clinical cancers. Tumor cells are evolutionally diverse with genetic heterogeneity within the population and samples are occasionally mixed with normal cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that additional filtration of the data considering ±3 bp of the SNVs is useful for lowering the error rate and, thus, for increasing the detection limit. Further bioinformatics tools could address these concerns of accuracy and sensitivity. Moreover, we expect that the drawbacks of MinION should be lessened by rapid improvements in the sequencing technology.One of the characteristics of MinION is its convenience for use, including its portability and easy settings for the library preparation and sequencing. Although second-generation sequencers have enabled us to easily conduct genotyping in clinical samples, we need to develop simple and cost-effective procedures to identify driver genes in each patient for personalized medicine for various kinds of cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma. In our study, we could detect the major driver genes, which have diverse patterns, including point mutations and fusions, using MinION. In lung adenocarcinoma, a number of molecular-targeting medicines are available, such as gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib for EGFR;34 crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib for ALK;35 and vandetanib and cabozantinib for RET.36 The detection of KRAS mutations is also required because a large portion of patients harbor these mutations, but there are no effective anti-cancer drugs targeting KRAS. The simple methods of MinION sequencing could possibly enable small/mid-scale research centers and hospitals to conduct research studies by genotyping driver genes and selecting suitable therapeutic approaches.Following the initial success of this methodological development, the obvious next goal is to expand this approach to other cancers. Thus, additional primer sets should be designed for various genes that have clinical and diagnostic importance depending on the cancer types. Eventually, it would be particularly beneficial to design an array of primer sets covering the representative frequently mutated genes as depicted in some commercial cancer panels. Therefore, further technical developments are needed, such as designing accurate and robust PCR primers for each gene.In addition to the detection of the cancerous mutations, using the long MinION reads, we could analyze the structural alterations and phasing of SNPs and mutations. It is important to elucidate the allelic background of mutations that are occasionally distantly located. For example, mutual associations between primary and secondary mutations, particularly mutations associated with drug resistance,31,32 have important clinical relevance. In addition to the cases of EGFR, various types of associations between primary and secondary/drug-resistant mutations have been reported. For example, for ALK-fusion-positive lung adenocarcinoma patients, drugs that molecularly target the tyrosine kinases, such as crizotinib, have been used. Similar to other effective anti-cancer drugs, a relapse frequently occurs as resistant clones are developed. Patients move to the second line tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which could also eventually become ineffective.37 However, intriguingly, very recent reports indicated that, in some cases, the cancer recovers the sensitivity for the previous round of drugs depending on the patterns of the initial and secondary resistant mutations and their allelic backgrounds.38,39 For these cases, long-read sequencing could provide indispensable information for selecting the next therapeutic approaches. This study is the first step toward a more widespread application of long-read sequence-based diagnosis in cancers in general clinical practice.The authors would like to thank K. Imamura, T.

IntroductionWide hybridization or distant crossing refers to the inter-specific or above-specific hybridization.1 It is a useful breeding strategy that has been used for crop improvement by transferring many desired traits from wild species to crops.2–4 The hybridization involves the selection of maternal and paternal parents, and often one parent can be maternal or paternal, and the other paternal or maternal, respectively, which is referred to as reciprocal crossings. It is well known that the reciprocal hybrids share identical nuclei but have different maternal cytoplasms. Therefore, the major difference between the reciprocal hybrids is the source of their cytoplasms.Reciprocal hybrids often show different phenotypes. A good example is crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana and A. arenosa. When A. thaliana was used as the maternal parent and A. arenosa as the paternal parent, many viable seeds were produced. In contrast, the reciprocal cross did not yield any viable seeds.5 Several genetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the differences between the reciprocal hybrids. For example, maternal effects model is defined as the causal influence of the maternal genotype or phenotype on the offspring phenotype,6 while the parent-origin effects model hypothesizes that female and male gametes contribute different sets of active alleles or else different complements of gene products to the seed.7 Cytoplasmic inheritance.8,9 and cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction10 models mainly elucidate the interactions between chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and the exogenous nuclear genome on the influence of cytoplasmic inheritance, respectively. Gene imprinting,11 the dominance model, over-dominant effects and epistasis hypothesis12–14 have also been proposed to explain the phenomenon. However, the underlying biological mechanisms accounting for the differences between reciprocal hybrids remain to be deciphered. Because the main differences between the reciprocal hybrids are in their cytoplasms, it is reasonable to assume that the most essential question is how the cytoplasm influences gene expression. Recent studies have pointed out that gene expression can be regulated by epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation.15 Therefore, whether different cytoplasms can lead to the changes in methylation profile, and then affect gene expression levels is the key point to explain the phenotypic differences in reciprocal hybrids.Cytoplasm is where many biochemical reactions take place, including the formation of mature small RNAs (sRNAs) such as miRNAs and siRNAs that are often involved in regulation of gene expression.16,17 miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate eukaryotic gene expression by cleaving their respective target genes at the posttranscriptional level. They specifically bind to mRNAs based on sequence pairing, leading to the degradation of their target mRNAs.18,19 In reciprocal crossings between A. thaliana ecotypes Ler and C24, researchers observed increased levels of 21-nt miRNAs in both hybrids compared with those in their parents.20 siRNAs are a class of double stranded RNA molecules, 20–25 bp in length, and may direct chromatin modification through RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and transposon silencing.21–23 Changes in 24-nt siRNA levels in two A. thaliana ecotypes showed correlated with changes in DNA methylation, creating allelic variants that might contribute to the phenotypic heterosis.24 An increase in genome-wide DNA methylation in A. thaliana reciprocal hybrids, possibly due to RdDM pathway, might alter circadian rhythms and gene expression in F1 hybrids.20 The maternal siRNAs as regulators of parental genome imbalance and gene expression could be transmitted to hybrids and regulate the seed size in reciprocal crosses.25 It was also reported that there were different profiles of 24-nt sRNAs in reciprocal hybrids, which might lead to the diversity of phenotypes.26 However, such questions as what the differences of DNA methylation profiles between two reciprocal hybrids are, whether the differences are induced by cytoplasmic siRNAs, and whether or how they regulate gene expression and subsequent phenotypes remain elusive.In our previous studies, reciprocal crossings between cultivated species Solanum lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom (for simplicity hereafter M was used for Micro-Tom) and wild type S. Pimpinellifolium line WVa700 (W was similarly used for WVa700) were performed, and the resulting reciprocal hybrids (M × W and W × M were similarly used for Micro-Tom_WVa700 and WVa700_Micro-Tom, respectively) displayed different phenotypes in terms of plant height (43.79 cm for M × W and 41.89cm for W × M), fruit shape index (0.95 for M × W and 0.92 for W × M) and single fruit weight (3.54g for M × W and 4.40g for W × M).26 To unveil the underlying possible epigenetic mechanisms, we profiled, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) method, and compared the DNA methylation patterns of the entire genomes of M, W and their reciprocal hybrids (M × W and W × M). We found that both reciprocal hybrids had lower methylation levels in CpG islands (CGIs) and major types of retroelements than their parents, suggesting that the crossing process per se may reduce the methylation levels of reciprocal hybrids in these regions. Importantly, the two reciprocal hybrids showed different DNA methylation patterns across their entire genomes, with major differences in gene body regions. We found 79 different methylated genes (DMGs) between the reciprocal hybrids, and 14 of which were randomly selected for analyses of their expression levels using qRT-PCR. We found that DNA methylation correlated negatively with gene expression in the promoter regions, while in gene body regions the correlation was complicated. Further association analysis of DNA methylation with siRNAs expression revealed that the methylation levels mainly inversely correlated with the siRNAs expression levels in gene body regions of the related genes. Our research suggested that the direction of hybridization induced the differences of epigenomes in the reciprocal hybrids. And the differences of DNA methylation profiles might be modified by siRNAs existed in maternal cytoplasms, leading to the distinct gene expression levels between the reciprocal hybrids.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsInbred lines of S. lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom (for simplicity, we used “M” for Micro-Tom in this study) (2n = 24) and S. pimpinellifolium line WVa700 (similarly “W” for WVa700) (2n = 24) were used as parents, and reciprocal crosses between the parental lines were made to produce two different types of hybrids M × W (i.e., Micro-Tom × WVa700) and W × M (WVa700 × Micro-Tom), respectively. A total of 80 tomato plants, with 20 plants for each of the four genotypes (W, M, W × M and M × W), were grown in a greenhouse at 23 °C with a photoperiod of 16-h light and 8-h dark and 60% relative humidity.2.2. Extraction, 5mC antibody immunoprecipitation and sequencing of DNATotal genomic DNA was extracted from 45-day-old leaves of the reciprocal hybrids and their parent plants using CTAB method as described by Murray and Thompson.27 At this stage, the differences in leaf phenotype and plant morphology among the four genotypes of tomato plants became evident. Three seedlings were pooled in each genotype sample for genomic DNA extraction. The quality of DNA was analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Five µg DNA was then randomly fragmented into small pieces with most of them 100–500 bp in length and purified by QIA quick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Four DNA libraries were constructed, namely the M, W, M × W and W × M DNA libraries. After DNA-end repair and 3’-dA overhang, DNA was ligated to an Illumina sequencing primer adaptor. The double-stranded DNA was subsequently denatured and immunoprecipitated using 5mC antibody. Real time quantitative PCR analysis was performed to validate the quality of immunoprecipitated DNA fragments. DNA with high quality was used for PCR amplification and bands between 200-300 bp were selected, and subsequently sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 system (SBS KIT-HS V3, Illumina).2.3. Bioinformatics analysisSequence data were obtained through filtering out the adapter, reads containing more than 10% N and low quality reads. MeDIP-Seq data was mapped to reference genome (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.3_release/ITAG2.3_genomic.fasta (12 June 2015, data last accessed)) by soapaligner, only unique alignments with no more than 2 mismatches were chosen for further analyses. The uniquely mapped reads were used to analyse the distribution of reads in genome chromosomes and different genomic regions. Peak scanning was performed using MACS (version 1.4.0) to identify genomic regions that were enriched with methylated reads. The scan graphs of two samples were merged to identify putative different methylation regions. The read numbers of individual methylated region from any two of the four genotypes were used to calculate the normalized log2 values and P-value, with chi-square statistics and a false discovery rate (FDR) statistics. The filtering criteria for P-value and the fold change were =0.05 and =2, respectively. DMRs were divided into two groups: the hypo-methylated (down) DMRs and the hyper-methylated (up) DMRs. The genes overlapped with DMRs were deemed as DMGs. DMGs were functionally clustered via Gene Ontology analysis to explore their biological functions, using the DAVID functional annotation tool with P = 0.05. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was carried out to identify significant enriched metabolic pathway or signal transduction pathway. The calculation formula of analysis is the same as that of GO function analysis. Q-value = 0.05 was used as the threshold to determine significant enrichment pathway in DEGs.2.4. Bisulfite sequencingTo validate the results of MeDIP-seq, the bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction was performed using the same genomic DNA materials. Briefly, 2 µg DNA was treated with sodium bisulfate using the EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Zymo Research, Orange Country, US) and then incubated at 98 °C for10 minutes and 64 °C for 2.5 hours. 10 pairs of primers for selected genes were designed by the MethPrimer online software (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer) and were shown as Supplementary Table S1. The bisulfite-treated DNA was PCR amplified by with these primers. PCR products were purified with the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and then cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China) and sequenced (Sunny, Shanghai, China). At least 15 clones were sequenced for each sample. The methylation level was calculated by the ratio of unconverted cytosines over the total cytosines, including three types: CG, CHG and CHH. The final bisulfate sequencing results were analysed according to the Kismeth website (http://Katahdin.mssm.edu/Kismeth (8 January 2016, data last accessed)).282.5. Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA from the 45-day-old leaves of the two reciprocal hybrids was extracted using the Trizol method per the manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and used to construct small RNA libraries.26 Three biological replicates were included for all the samples. The first strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo (dT) primer from 2 µg RNA using the Reverse Transcriptase M-MLV kit (Takara). Primers used for real-time PCR were listed in Supplementary Table S1. The real-time PCR was performed using a SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara) on the ABI STEPONE Real-Time PCR System. Relative quantification was performed using the CT (2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>Ct) method. Each sample was performed in triplicate for real-time PCR reaction.2.6. Small RNA sequencing and analysis of siRNAsSmall RNA high-throughput sequencing of four libraries (representing M, W, W × M and M × W genotypes, respectively) was as previously described.26 The small RNA-seq clean data have been deposited in the SRA database of NCBI with accession number SRX722032, SRX722033, SRX722034, and SRX722035. The leaf materials used for the small RNA libraries were same as those for DNA extraction and MeDIP-seq. After eliminating the contaminant reads and low quality reads, tags were used to predict siRNA using tag2siRNA software.29 The clean reads were analysed by length distribution and common sequences. Then, the siRNAs sequences were matched to the DMGs via blast searching of NCBI databases (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi (18 August 2016, data last accessed)).3. Results3.1. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of two parental lines and their reciprocal hybridsWhole genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of two parental lines (M and W) and their reciprocal hybrids (M × W and W × M) were profiled using MeDIP-seq. The MeDIP-seq data have been deposited in the SRA database of NCBI with accession number SRR5397373, SRR5397378, SRR5397384 and SRR5397386. We obtained up to 4.5 Gb of MeDIP-seq data for each genotype (Table 1). After removal of adapter sequences, contaminations, and low-quality reads, more than 90 million reads, regarded as clean data, from each genotype were analysed. Total reads were mapped to the reference genome (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/tomato_genome/annotation/ITAG2.3_release/ITAG2.3_genomic.fasta (12 June 2015, data last accessed)), with mapping rates higher than 96% for individual genotypes. Reads were distributed on each chromosome region, with good genome coverage (see Supplementary Fig. S1). 57.3–58.79% of the mapped reads were uniquely mapped to reference genome for each genotype (Table 1). The distribution of MeDIP-seq reads in different CpG density regions was shown, and the majority of the reads in all samples were located in regions with 5 to 25 CpGs (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

CGIs are mainly located in promoter regions and play important roles in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Therefore, we compared the methylation status of CGIs and CGI shores (spanning 2kb fragment up- and down-stream of each CGI). We found that in both parents the CGIs had more methylation reads than the CGI shores had. In contrast, CGIs did not enrich much more methylated reads than the CGI shores enriched in the reciprocal hybrids (Fig. 1a). In particular, CGI shores had more methylated reads than CGIs had in M × W. More interestingly, the methylation levels of CGIs were lower in reciprocal hybrids than in their parents, suggesting that the process of hybridization led to the decrease in DNA methylation levels in these regions. Furthermore, W × M had higher methylation levels than M × W in CGIs (Fig. 1a), which was one of the major differences between the reciprocal hybrids in DNA methylation profiles.

The X axis indicates the position around CpG islands (intragenic regions) and the Y axis indicates the normalized read number. These panels can reflect the methylation levels around CpG islands and gene body regions. (See online article for colour version of this figure).We also analysed the distribution of the reads in intragenic region and nearby 2kb sequences, and found that 2kb upstream region showed higher methylation levels than other regions in all four genotypes (parents and reciprocal hybrids). The DNA methylation levels decreased sharply before intragenic region, indicating that promoter regions were hypermethylated and might play a key role in the modification of DNA methylation (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, W (wild species) and the two reciprocal hybrids showed similar methylation levels in promoter regions, while M (cultivated species) had the lowest methylation levels.Considering that methylation of repeat elements was usually associated with genomic instability through structural changes such as transposition, translocation, and recombination,30 we compared the distribution of reads in such different repeat elements as LTR (long terminal repeat)/Gypsy, LTR/Copia, DNA/CMC-Enspm and SINE (short interactive nuclear element)/SINE. These four main repeat elements had the vast majority of the reads in all four samples (Table 2), and the LTR retroelements were especially rich with more than 90% reads, suggesting that such retroelements may play an important part in DNA methylation modification. It is noteworthy that the methylation levels in the major type of LTR retroelements of the two reciprocal hybrids were different, and lower than those of their parents (Table 2).

Divergent DNA methylation patterns in the reciprocal hybridsOur previous research showed that the two reciprocal hybrids displayed significantly different phenotypes in terms of fruit shape index, single fruit weight and plant height.26 We here investigated DNA methylation patterns of the reciprocal hybrids to explore the possibility that these phenotypic changes were associated with or induced by changes in DNA methylation. Peak scanning software (MACS 1.4.0) was used to identify reads-enriched regions. Methylated peak, an important parameter in analysing DNA methylation profile,31,32 was used to detect the highly methylated regions (HMRs) and only uniquely mapped reads were utilized in the whole genome peak scanning. As shown in Table 1, 48935 and 48179 peaks were identified in the reciprocal hybrids W × M and M × W samples, respectively. The methylation levels in the 2kb region upstream of 5’UTR, in the gene body (including 5’UTR, coding sequence (CDS) region, intron, and 3’UTR) and in the 2kb downstream region of 3’UTR in the genomes of the two hybrids were further analysed. The ratio of peaks was used to represent the methylation density of individual specific genome elements. As shown in Fig. 2, the 2kb upstream regions had the most abundant peaks, followed by the CDS regions and the 2kb downstream regions. Notably, the frequencies of the methylated peaks in both CDS region and intron were higher in W × M (with 13.32% in the CDS region and 9.02% in intron) than in M × W (12.85%, 8.72%) (Fig. 2).

(See online article for colour version of this figure).The differences between the two reciprocal hybrids as well as the two parents were further investigated by searching differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and the DMRs data-based whole-genome methylomes of M × W and W × M were shown in Fig. 3 There were 109 DMRs (between the two reciprocal hybrids) and 3208 DMRs (between the two parents), obviously many more differences between the parents than those between the two reciprocal hybrids. Comparison of gene methylation status between the two reciprocal hybrids revealed that there were 60 hypermethylated and 49 hypomethylated DMRs in six gene elements of W × M. Most of the DMRs were observed in introns (31.19%) and CDS regions (23.85%) (Table 3). Interestingly, more than one DMR were found in some of the DMGs. For examples, Solyc03g025770.2 gene was hypermethylated in the 2kb upstream region and CDS region, and Solyc00g090430.2 gene was hypomethylated in the 2kb upstream region, 3’UTR, intron and CDS region in W × M. Excluding repeat regions, there were 79 genes with different methylation patterns between the two reciprocal hybrids.

Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis of DMGsIn this study, we referred any gene with methylation peaks in its promoter or gene body regions as a methylated gene. As mentioned above, a total of 79 DMGs were found upon comparison of the two reciprocal hybrids, including 41 hypermethylated genes and 38 hypomethylated genes in W × M. These differentially methylated genes were annotated, including a cell division protease ftsH, a TPR repeat protein, a histone-lysine n-methyltransferase, a b-zip transcription factor-like, among others (Supplementary Table S2). GO analysis revealed that the DMGs in M × W and W × M were functionally belonging to one or more following categories: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). These DMGs were further divided into 17 functional clusters, with 10 in BP, 5 in CC and 2 in MF. Interestingly, hypermethylated gene Solyc08g013860.2 in M × W was related to mitochondrial part, participating in dicarboxylic acid metabolic process, and also hypermethylated in the parental line M than the other parental line W (Supplementary Table S3). Per the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, we observed that gene Solyc01g099150.2 and gene Solyc02g092780.1 were highly enriched in pathways: linoleic acid metabolism (Ko00591) and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis (Ko00514), with Q-value = 0.05. Furthermore, two DMGs (Solyc05g056450.2 and Solyc08g013860.2) were involved in fructose and mannose metabolism and in carbon fixation in photosynthetic pathways (Supplementary Table S4).3.4. Validation of MeDIP-seq data using bisulfite sequencingTo validate the MeDIP-seq data, we performed bisulfite sequencing of ten randomly selected DMRs of associated genes which showed the same methylation levels between the two parents. While, compared with W × M, four DMRs of associated genes [Solyc00g020840.2 (Intron), Solyc00g282510.1 (CDS), Solyc08g065650.1 (CDS) and Solyc00g020940.1 (Upstream 2k)] had higher methylation levels and six DMRs of associated genes [Solyc05g008030.1 (Intron), Solyc03g115180.1 (Intron), Solyc06g065730.2 (Intron) Solyc03g115180.1 (CDS), Solyc07g009320.2 (Intron), Solyc03g025770.2.1 (CDS)] had lower methylation level in M × W, essentially the same as those results revealed by MeDIP-seq. The bisulfite sequencing results proved that methylation levels of both Solyc05g008030.1 (Intron) and Solyc03g115180.1 (Intron) were up-regulated in W × M, while methylation levels of Solyc00g282510.1 (CDS) and Solyc00g020840.2 (Intron) were down-regulated (Fig. 4). Solyc08g065650.1 (CDS) and Solyc00g020940.1 (Upstream 2k) had higher levels of methylation in M × W, while Solyc03g115180.1 (CDS), Solyc07g009320.2 (Intron), Solyc03g025770.2 (CDS) and Solyc06g065730.2 (Intron) had higher methylation levels in W × M (see Supplementary Fig. S3).

Association analysis of gene expression and DNA methylationTo investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression, we randomly selected 14 DMGs, including seven genes with up-regulated methylation levels and the other seven genes with down-regulated methylation levels in M × W, for qRT-PCR analysis of their expression levels in the reciprocal hybrids (Fig. 5). Correlated with the different methylation patterns, the selected genes showed different expression levels between the two reciprocal hybrids. Specifically, in the M × W hybrid, three genes, namely Solyc04g071320.2, Solyc02g094350.2 and Solyc07g062890.2, were hypermethylated in the 2kb region upstream of the gene body, correlated with lower levels of transcripts. In contrast, the gene named Solyc05g018390.2 was hypomethylated in the 2kb region upstream of its gene body and had higher transcript levels. Notably, DNA methylation in the gene body regions is also mostly (but not always) inversely correlated with gene expression. Eight genes, namely Solyc05g008030.1, Solyc06g065730.2, Solyc00g282510.1, Solyc01g111020.2, Solyc02g092780.1, Solyc03g115180.1, Solyc07g009320.2 and Solyc03g025770.2, exhibited inverse correlation between the DNA methylation levels and their gene expression levels in the gene body regions. For examples, Solyc01g111020.2 had higher methylation level in its intron and CDS region, but dramatically down-regulated expression level in W × M. Solyc02g092780.1 showed a lower methylation level and a higher expression level in W × M (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S2). However, the intron of Solyc06g051760.2 and both the intron and CDS of Solyc03g097460.2 were hypermethylated in M × W, but both genes had higher levels of transcripts (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S2). These results suggested that there may be a negative correlation between the DNA methylation levels in the promoter regions and the gene expression levels, but in the gene body regions the correlation was complicated.

Association analysis of DNA methylation and small RNAsIt has been recently reported that siRNAs, generated via RNA interfering (RNAi) pathway, can target homologous genomic DNA sequences for cytosine methylation through the RdDM pathway.33,34 To investigate the possible relationship between siRNAs of different cytoplasms and differentially methylated patterns of the reciprocal hybrids, we analysed the accumulation of 24-nt siRNAs from small RNA high-throughput sequencing (small RNA-seq) data. Firstly, we compared the distribution of clean reads in chromosome from MeDIP-seq and small RNA-seq in the two reciprocal hybrids (see Supplementary Fig. S4). After removing reads mapped to rRNAs, tRNAs, and small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs, we newly data-mined 15,021,181 and 12,515,123 reads of 24-nt siRNAs from M × W and W × M, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). In both reciprocal hybrids, siRNAs were mapped to DMGs. We found that the expression levels of siRNAs, which were mapped to DMGs, were different between the two reciprocal hybrids. As shown in Fig. 6, those 15 genes with different methylation levels between the reciprocal hybrids were covered by different numbers of siRNAs. For example, Solyc00g0208400.2 was hypermethylated in M × W and mapped with 282 siRNAs, whereas in W × M there was no associated siRNAs at all. However, there was also opposite circumstance. Solyc06g065730.2 gene was hypermethylated in W × M and mapped with 201 siRNAs, while in M × W the number of associated siRNAs was 307 (Supplementary Table S6). As a result, the methylation levels of ten associated DMGs showed a negative correlation with their siRNAs’ expression levels, while methylation levels of the other five DMGs showed a positive correlation with siRNAs’ expression levels between the two reciprocal hybrids (Fig. 6).

DiscussionWide hybridization, as a useful strategy for hybrid offspring to change genetic composition and phenotype, has been used in basic research and practice in plants.1,35 It’s well observed that reciprocal hybrids usually display different phenotypes. Several genetic models such as maternal effects, parent-origin effects and cytoplasmic inheritance have been proposed to determine if reciprocal differences are interacting with different genetic backgrounds.36,37 It has also been found that epigenetic changes influence gene expression and subsequently govern relative characteristics.38,39 However the underlying molecular, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms remain elusive. In our current study, we established genome-wide methylation and siRNAs profiles between the two reciprocal hybrids and performed a comparative analysis of these profiles and their association with gene expression. This research revealed an epigenetic mechanism possibly accounting for the different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids.In the present study, we established the global methylation profiles in S. lycopersicum, S. pimpinellifolium and their reciprocal hybrids by high-throughput sequencing, and identified the differentially methylated genes between the reciprocal hybrids. By bisulfite sequencing, we confirmed the reliability of MeDIP-seq results. At the genome-wide level, we compared the differences of methylation patterns between the reciprocal hybrids and their parents. Firstly, the W × M hybrid had higher methylation levels of methylation CGIs than its reciprocal hybrid M × W had (Fig. 1a). CpG islands normally remain un-methylated, whereas the methylation of CpG islands, especially in promoter regions, is often associated with gene silencing.40,41 Therefore, we hypothesized that the differences in CGIs methylation between the reciprocal hybrids might be correlated with the different gene expression levels between them. Secondly, sharply-decreased methylation levels after 2kb upstream region were observed, and the parents showed remarkable differences of methylation levels in these promoter regions (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the parental line M (cultivated species) showed lower methylation levels than the other parental line W (wild species) in 2kb upstream region. It has been reported that 2kb upstream region (the promoter region) as a repressive epigenetic mark had a role in down-regulating gene expression.42,43 The lower methylation levels of promoter region might be inversely correlated with higher transcription levels of certain genes in M than in W. Thirdly, we analysed the distribution of reads in different repeat elements and found that LTR retroelements had vast majority of the reads (Table 2). It is noteworthy that the reciprocal hybrids had different methylation levels in these major types of retroelements. Generally, when there was a genomic hybridization, parental genomes suffered from gene shock caused by genome recombination.36 Methylation of these repeat elements was an important modification in the maintenance of genomic stability.30 The differences of methylation levels between the reciprocal hybrids in major types of retroelements might be correlated with the different cytoplasmic genome backgrounds during the process of hybridization.Specifically, we analysed the methylation patterns in different gene elements, including 2kb region upstream of 5’UTR, 5’UTR, CDS region, intron, 3’UTR and 2kb downstream of 3’UTR. The data showed that 2kb upstream region had the highest methylation level, whereas the main differences between the two reciprocal hybrids concentrated in introns and CDS regions (Fig. 2). It meant that the differences in DNA methylation between the reciprocal hybrids were predominantly located in gene body regions. Totally, we searched 109 DMRs and mapped them to 79 genes (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S2). Hence, an interesting phenomenon was that some methylated genes had more than one DMR, indicating that there might be the genomic region-specific DNA methylation patterns. After annotating the differentially methylated genes, the functions of these genes were revealed. Per GO analysis, we found that one DMG Solyc08g013860.2 was related to mitochondrial part and participated in dicarboxylic acid metabolic process, also showed differential methylation levels between the two parents (Supplementary Table S3). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that gene Solyc01g099150.2 and gene Solyc02g092780.1 were highly enriched in pathways: linoleic acid metabolish and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis. Furthermore, two DMGs (Solyc05g056450.2 and Solyc08g013860.2) were involved in carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and fructose and mannose metabolism pathways (Supplementary Table S4). It has been reported that carbohydrate content and sugar metabolism can regulate tomato fruit development.44,45 And the reciprocal hybrids showed significantly different phenotypes in fruit shape index and single fruit weight, as mentioned above. These results suggested that there existed differences of epigenetic regulation in the reciprocal hybrids that might be responsible for phenotypic diversities.As a common epigenetic process, DNA methylation can inactivate mobile elements and silence the repetitive elements to regulate gene expression or influence other epigenetic courses.46,47 To explore how the differences in methylation levels are responsible for the distinctive phenotypes in the reciprocal hybrids, we carried out the association analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression. In our study, randomly selected 14 DMGs were used to analyse the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, and most of them showed remarkably different transcription levels between the two reciprocal hybrids, suggesting that DNA methylation changes in the reciprocal hybrids are correlated with altered gene expression. Specifically, the negative relationship between DNA methylation and transcription has been reported in several papers.20,48 There are also some reports putting forward that gene body methylation, especially intronic DNA methylation, is positively correlated with gene expression.49,50 Our results showed that gene expression was negatively correlated with DNA methylation in the promoter region, while in the gene body region the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression was complicated (Fig. 5). Here, we assumed that, DNA methylation in the promoter regions as well as the gene body regions modulated the expression of related genes, and the differences in transcription levels may subsequently contribute to the different phenotypes between the reciprocal hybrids. To fully address the point, the transcriptomes of all the DMGs revealed should be established by RNA sequencing and comparatively analysed in further research.In the process of reciprocal hybridization, the source of cytoplasm (mainly comes from maternal parent) is a primary difference between the reciprocal hybrids. Therefore, small RNAs, which are matured in cytoplasms are different between the reciprocal hybrids. Moreover, 24-nt siRNAs have been reported to direct DNA methylation and regulate gene expression.51,21 In the current study, we analysed the siRNAs which were generated in M × W and W × M hybrids, and associated these siRNAs with DMGs in the reciprocal hybrids. And we found 15 genes (among 79 DMGs) were associated with siRNAs in both reciprocal hybrids. Interestingly, siRNAs’ expression levels were mostly negatively correlated with DNA methylation levels (Fig. 6). It is notable that most DMRs of associated genes that were mapped with siRNAs were located in the gene body regions (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, these results are consistent with a recent study in Arabidopsis that methylation levels were inversely correlated with their siRNAs profiles in genomic transcribed region of protein coding genes.52 So it is reasonable to hypothesize that different sources of siRNAs induced the different DNA methylation patterns between the two reciprocal hybrids, and the correlation might be also associated with specific genomic regions.In conclusion, this study explored the epigenomic differences of tomato reciprocal hybrids. The reciprocal hybrids showed divergent methylation levels in different genomic regions, especially in the gene body regions. Gene expression analysis suggested that methylation in the promoter region inversely regulates transcription, while in gene body regions the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression is complicated. Moreover, association analysis of DNA methylation and siRNAs implied the differences of DNA methylation might be induced by siRNAs existed in different cytoplasms. And these correlations were relative to specific genomic regions. Taken together, this research proposed that the direction of hybridization caused variance in DNA methylation profiles between the reciprocal hybrids. Furthermore, the distinct methylation levels might be regulated by siRNAs and then lead to the changes in gene expression levels and ultimately the different phenotypes in the reciprocal hybrids.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingNational Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31272159) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31572118) and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. LZ12C15001).

IntroductionThe use of RNA-guided nucleases revolutionized our ability to modify complex genomes and to control gene expression networks, in the same manner that PCR revolutionized molecular biology at the end of the 20th century.1–10 The specificity of Cas9 nucleases is determined in part by the so-called spacer sequence of the guide RNA (gRNA) associated to the protein and responsible for target recognition. This makes the Cas9 proteins easily reprogrammable by simply varying the sequence of the spacer.1 This attractive feature of the Cas9 nucleases has been exploited for genome editing and gene expression modulation, as well as for generating disease and therapeutic models.7,9,11–15The efficiencies of various gRNA spacers to result targeted DNA cleavage by Cas9 vary widely. While several sequence determinants of efficient target recognition for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), have been revealed,16–21 an adequate prediction of the efficiency of a given spacer sequence has not been achieved, partially because the activity of a gRNA may be modulated by the genomic context of the target: a factor difficult to predict.22,23 Generally, several candidate spacer sequences are tested before choosing the appropriate ones for performing the desired genetic modifications. Existing methods to test the efficiency of a given spacer sequence commonly measure the sequence alterations acquired during the repair of the cleaved DNA.24 Breaks in the DNA involving one or both strands are effectively repaired by the cell using one of the two main repair pathways: the homologous recombination (HR) or the more error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).25 NHEJ-dependent repair of double strand breaks frequently leads to small insertions or deletions (indels), the frequency of which can be explored to monitor the efficiency of Cas9 cleavage.26–28 Accordingly, many methods rely on the assessment of indel frequencies that are usually determined by PCR amplification of the corresponding region followed by Surveyor/T7E1 nuclease assays,29 high resolution melt analysis,30,31 fluorescent PCR-capillary gel electrophoresis32 and direct33 or deep11,12,34 sequencing. Alternatively, a large number of clones can be sequenced upon the PCR amplification of the regions of interest. The occurrence of HR events as a result of HR repair can also be monitored by analysing clones using PCR followed by restriction digestion35 or by sequencing,34 as well as by Southern blotting36–38 of genomic DNA. As another approach, reporter assays are explored for detecting HR events: (I) where a fluorescent signal is measured as a result of recombination events correcting a truncated fluorescent protein;39,40 (II) or where a fluorescent protein expression cassette is incorporated at the cleavage site - at the cost of the laborious construction of homologous arms.41 In case of exploiting NHEJ repair, reporter assays are also frequently employed for monitoring indel events that alter the reading frame of a fluorescent protein, resulting in either loss or recovery of the fluorescent signal.35,39,42 Reporter assays that enable the use of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to monitor the repair of double strand breaks are convenient, making genomic DNA isolation and PCR amplification -including the sometimes very tedious condition/primer optimization- unnecessary. They also provide more accurate estimations than Surveyor/T7E1 assays and are much less expensive than deep sequencing.24 However, these approaches generally require extra cloning steps to become applicable to a particular task and lose the advantage of PCR-based methods of being capable of monitoring spacer efficiency in the genomic context of the particular targets.Here, we introduce a reporter assay, which requires no additional cloning steps and is capable of testing spacer efficiencies on targets within their genomic context. The method explores NHEJ-cloning (NHEJ repair mediated integration) of a GFP-expression cassette to a target site that is cleaved by SpCas9. The key feature of this approach is the use of a ‘self-cleaving’ plasmid that enhances targeted integration.Using SpCas9 and a self-cleaving plasmid, we also demonstrate a very convenient and effective way of inserting relatively large DNA fragments into the mammalian genome. NHEJ-cloning has been described in zebrafish, using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and SpCas9, and in mammalian cells, using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and TALEN.38,43,44 There have been a few attempts to use SpCas9 for NHEJ-cloning of larger DNA cassettes in mammalian cells as well,45,46 however, they achieved integrations at a relatively low frequency, typically under 1% without selection or FACS-enrichment. Here, we achieved a frequency that is greater by over an order of magnitude. Thus, this approach facilitates the implementation of several genome engineering tasks in mammalian systems, making them less labor-intensive, especially so regarding the insertion of expression cassettes to safe-harbour locations in contrast with the use of random integration.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsAll restriction enzymes, Klenow polymerase and T4 ligase were acquired from Thermo Scientific, Q5 and Phusion polymerases T7 endonuclease I, and Gibson Assembly Master Mix were from New England Biolabs Inc. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Microsynth AG and Sigma-Aldrich Co. and their sequences are listed in the Supplementary Data. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium, foetal bovine serum, Turbofect, Lipofectamine 2000, GlutaMAX, penicillin, streptomycin and puromycin were acquired from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and trimethoprim (TMP) from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (T7883).2.2. Vector constructionsBriefly, SpCas9-gRNA expressing plasmids (targeting human and mouse genes and also containing TL1 and TL2 spacers) were generated from the px330 vector (Addgene # 422303), and cloning spacers into pmCherry_gRNA plasmid was conducted according to Hanhui Ma et al.47 The construction of pmCherry_gRNA, pX330-Flag-ehSpCas9 and pX330-Flag-wtSpCas9 is described in (Kulcsár et al. 2017 submitted). The nuclease inactive SpCas9 (dCas9) expressing plasmid was created from px335 (Addgene #423353) by using Body Double cloning method.48 The self-cleaving plasmids were created by using Gibson assembly method. The self-cleaving plasmid containing a puromycin cassette (pSc1-puro) was constructed by using pLKO.1puro plasmid (Addgene #845349). The self-cleaving plasmid with a degradation domain (pSc1-DD) was created from pBMN DHFR(DD)-YFP plasmid (Addgene #2932550). The Prnp gene targeting homologous recombination donor plasmid was created by using nested PCR. The Rosa26 locus homologous recombination donor plasmid was created by using pDonor-MCS-rosa26 plasmid [Addgene #3720051]. For more detailed information see Supplementary Materials and Methods. The sequences of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth AG).2.3. Cell culture and transfectionAll cell lines, Neuro-2a (CCL-131), HeLa (CCL-2), NIH/3T3 (CRL-1658), and HEK293 (CRL-1573)—all from ATCC, were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 in air and humidified atmosphere. All cell lines were checked regularly and before the experiments for mycoplasma infection.2.4. Experiments with pSc1, pSc2 plasmids, and HDR assaysCells were seeded at 1.5×105 cells/well in the case of HeLa, Neuro-2a (N2a) and HEK293 cells, and at 3×105 cells/well density for NIH/3T3 cells, on 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected by 2 µg total DNA/well, combining 1 µg Cas9-gRNA vector and 1 µg GFP vector DNAs (pSc1, pSc2, pHR-PRNP, pHR-ROSA), and using either Turbofect at 3 µl/µg total DNA (in the case of HeLa, N2a, and HEK293 cells) or Lipofectamine 2000 at 4.5 µl/µg total DNA (in the case of NIH/3T3 cells). Transfected cells were passaged at a 1:10 ratio until confluency reached 80–100% and the excess cells were analysed by FACS. The passaging continued until the transient expression disappeared (typically 12–15 days post transfection). Transfection efficiency was determined on the second day after transfection by measuring the fraction of GFP positive cells (the values obtained were considered 100%) and was later used to normalize the corresponding sample data. All transfections were made in triplicates.2.5. Coupled integration of the GFP and puromycin cassettesBefore performing the experiments, the lowest antibiotic concentration that kills all non-transfected N2a cells was determined by applying increasing concentrations of antibiotic, up to 3.1 µg/ml puromycin. A concentration of 0.7 µg/ml was the lowest that killed all cells after 2 weeks of selection. This concentration was used further for selection. N2a cells were co-transfected in four replicates with pSc1-puro and pten specific Cas9-gRNA plasmid, using the previously described protocol with the pSc1 plasmid. As a control for random integration, pSc1-puro was co-transfected with a plasmid harbouring an inactive SpCas9 cassette (dCas9). Non-transfected control cells were also used to monitor selection effectiveness. Puromycin selection was started 2 days after transfection and on days 2 and 12 post-transfection the number of GFP positive cells were measured by FACS.2.6. Experiments with pSc1-DDTransfection was performed similarly as above with pSc1 plasmid, except now 1 µg Cas9-gRNA, 300 ng pSc1-DD, and 300 ng mCherry expressing plasmids were used per well for transfection on 6-well plates. Transfection efficiencies were determined 2 days after transfection by measuring the fraction of mCherry positive cells (the values obtained were considered 100%) and was later used to normalize the corresponding sample data. TMP (1 µM) was added to the media 24 h before FACS analysis.2.7. Experiments with eSpCas9A gRNA and mCherry coding plasmid (pmCherry_gRNA) was co-transfected with a wtSpCas9 or eSpCas9 coding plasmid (pX330-Flag-ehSpCas9 or pX330-Flag-wtSpCas9, respectively) and with the pSc1 self-cleaving plasmid into N2a cells. Transfection was performed similarly as with the pSc1 plasmid above, except now 760 ng Cas9 coding, 760 ng pSc1 and 480 ng pmCherry_gRNA plasmid was used. Transfection efficiencies were determined 2 days after transfection by measuring the fraction of GFP positive cells (the values obtained were considered 100%) and was later used to normalize the corresponding sample data.2.8. Isolation of genomic DNA and genomic PCRGenomic DNA from 1×106 cells was isolated after stable GFP-cassette integration (typically 12–15 days after transfection) using PureLink™ Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol or by following Gentra DNA purification protocol (Gentra Puregen Handbook, Qiagen). From the isolated genomic DNA PCR was conducted with Q5 polymerase (for PCR primers and conditions, see Supplementary Data).2.9. TIDE and T7 endonuclease I assayGenomic PCR products were gel excised, purified via NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit and were Sanger sequenced by Microsynth AG. Indel efficiencies were analysed by TIDE web tool33 (https://tide.nki.nl/) by comparing Cas9 treated and control samples.Samples of 200 ng from the same PCR reactions that were analysed by TIDE were digested with five units of T7 endonuclease I for 2 h at 37 °C and were then analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Densitometry assessment of cleaved and uncleaved bands were conducted with ImageJ software and the following formula was used to determine InDel efficiency: InDel = 100*(1 - (1 - (b + c)/(a + b + c))0.5), where b and c represent the cleaved products and a represents the uncleaved band.2.10. StatisticsDifferences between groups were tested for statistical significance in each experiment using one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test (IBM SPSS Statistics v.21).2.11. Flow cytometryFlow cytometry analysis was carried out on an Attune Acoustic Focusing Cytometer (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies). Attune Cytometric Software was used for data analysis. In all experiments, a total of 10,000 events were acquired and viable single cells were gated based on side and forward light-scatter parameters. The GFP signal was detected using a 488 nm diode laser for excitation and a 530/30 nm filter for emission and the mCherry fluorescent signal was detected using a 488 nm diode laser for excitation and a 640LP filter for emission.3. Results3.1. In-cell cleavage of a GFP-plasmid facilitates monitoring of gRNA efficienciesWe aimed to compare the DNA double strand break mediating efficiencies of different gRNAs with SpCas9. To this end, we measured the fluorescence intensities associated with GFP expression cassettes captured by the NHEJ repair system at the corresponding sites of the double strand breaks. Here, our main concern was whether NHEJ-mediated integration would sufficiently be efficient to be discernible by fluorescence-detection from the random integration background of the GFP cassette. To test this, first, we co-transfected N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells with a circular GFP expression vector (pEGFP-C1 - referred to as GFP-plasmid) along with the SpCas9 and gRNA expressing vectors, and monitored the integration events by the fluorescence of GFP after transfection. As a control, a nuclease inactive SpCas9 (dCas9) expressing plasmid was employed that allowed to monitor the decay of the fluorescent signal originating from transient expression and facilitated determination of targeted integration as being the signal detected above the background, non-targeted, random integration of the expression cassette.Five spacer sequences targeting three genes in the mouse genome, three for Prnp, one for Sprn and one for Piwil4 genes, were selected and the corresponding expression constructs with SpCas9 and gRNAs were co-transfected with the GFP-plasmid into N2a cells. Cells displaying GFP fluorescence were monitored by FACS until the signal derived from transient expression has decayed and the fluorescence stabilized. This occurred over a 12–15-day period in all experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1), depending on factors such as transfection efficiency, which could be determined by measuring the GFP fluorescence on the second day after transfection. Given that the level of stabilized fluorescence varies from experiment to experiment, all samples to be compared were tested side by side in these studies. In these experiments, however, after the transient expression decayed, none of the samples could be clearly distinguished from the dCas9 controls representing random integration (Supplementary Fig. S2A).Since we expected linearized plasmids to be more readily integrated, next, we linearized the GFP-plasmid with a restriction enzyme and tested its integration similarly in N2a cells, and also, with an overlapping set of gRNAs in NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Since the linearized DNA is more vulnerable to cellular nucleases, in order to decrease the possibility of digestion of the expression cassette before the targeted integration would take place, more than 1000 bp-long extra sequences were left at both sides of the GFP expression cassette when linearized by the restriction enzyme. The use of a linearized plasmid resulted in higher integrations in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C), however, similarly to the previous results using circular plasmid (Supplementary Fig. S2A), none of the samples provided signals over twice as large as the level of random integrations. This is in spite of that the majority of the employed gRNAs supported HR mediated targeted integration in N2a cells (unpublished results). These data, in line with the general perception, suggest that the efficiencies of capturing circular or pre-linearized exogenous DNA by NHEJ-repair at the sites of targeted cleavage are not generally sufficient to be clearly detectable above the level of random integration.The efficiency of targeted integration of exogenous DNA by NHEJ was reported to be somewhat higher when the donor plasmid was linearized inside the cell by designer nucleases.38,44,52 To exploit this possibility, we picked two efficient-gRNA expressing plasmids that were available in our laboratory (targeting Ttn and Rbl2 genes—referred to as Ttn and Rb, respectively), and cloned each corresponding protospacer into the GFP-plasmid either preceding, or both preceding and following the GFP-cassette (Fig. 1A). These plasmids and the control (protospacerless) GFP-plasmid were each co-transfected with a vector containing an active SpCas9 and the corresponding gRNA (Rb or Ttn) or a vector containing inactive SpCas9. The numbers of fluorescent cells were counted as previously. The in-cell cleavage of plasmids resulted targeted integrations four to six-fold above the background level of random integration measured with circular, protospacerless GFP-plasmid and active SpCas9 (Fig. 1B). in-cell cleavage of the GFP-plasmid facilitates targeted integration. (A) Scheme of the genomic integration of an in-cell cleavable plasmid. The target sequence of the gRNA (magenta) from the plasmid containing the SpCas9 is present both in the genome (magenta target in the grey double helix) and in the GFP-cassette containing plasmid - either preceding or at both ends (the latter case is shown in the figure by two magenta boxes) of the GFP-cassette (green). SpCas9 cleaves both the genome and the GFP-plasmid. During repair of the broken genomic DNA, the opened plasmid will efficiently integrate into the genome at the cleavage site even in the absence of homologous arms. The protospacer on the GFP-plasmid has to be redesigned and re-cloned for every new genomic target in order to achieve opening of the plasmid. (B) in-cell linearization of the circular plasmid increases the efficiency of the genomic integration. Two different genes, Rbl2 and Ttn were chosen and targeted by corresponding gRNAs (Rb and Ttn, respectively), to test the effect of in-cell linearization of the GFP-plasmid. Bars show the percentages of cells harbouring stably integrated GFP-cassette after co-transfection by an expression vector for both SpCas9 and either Rb or Ttn gRNAs and a circular GFP-plasmid that either contains one (Rb 1x, Ttn 1x) or - as on scheme A - two (Rb 2x, Ttn 2x) copies of the respective targets (light grey bars). As controls (dark grey bars), an inactive SpCas9 with the GFP plasmid (dead) and to measure the backgrounds without in-cell cleavage, an active SpCas9 with Rb or Ttn targets combined with the circular plasmids were used (Rb -, Ttn -). The values were compared to their respective circular control with the active nuclease.

Bars show the means ± S.D. of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections, which were normalized to the transfection efficiency (% GFP positive cells measured on 2nd day after transfection: ranging between 87 and 91%). ***P<0.001.The difference was less than two-fold between the two controls, when cleaving the genome without in-cell linearization and the random integration of a circular GFP-plasmid (Fig. 1B), similarly as we found earlier using different spacers (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Cleaving at both sides of the GFP-cassette may lead to more in-cell linearized plasmids, and so it may be expected to result in higher integrations. However, we detected no increased fluorescence with the plasmids that contain two targets thus, for the further experiments we cleaved only at one site of the plasmids.3.2. Construction of self-cleaving plasmids with universal target-spacer pairsAlthough the above results are encouraging and indicate that the integration of in-cell linearized plasmids without homology arms are effective in these cells, such a design does not allow the measurement of the actual integration to the SpCas9 cleaved genomic sites. This is because the same gRNA mediates the cleavage of the genome and of the plasmid, and thus, the two events are coupled and it is not possible to assess the background originating only from the random integration of the in-cell linearized plasmid independently of the genome cleavage.Furthermore, the efficiency of targeted integration when using the same target sequence both in the genome and in the GFP-plasmid (Fig. 1A) depends on both, possibly differing, effectiveness of cleaving the target in its genomic context and out of its genomic context on the GFP-plasmid. To allow a more comparable and adequate estimation of cleavage activities for various gRNAs on their targets in their genomic context, the use of one common GFP-plasmid that contains the same target sequence ensuring identical in-cell cleavage for all gRNAs to be tested, and which is also independent of the tested targets, would be the most adequate. In addition, such an approach would eliminate the need for the laborious cloning of each corresponding protospacer to the GFP-plasmid for each spacer to be tested. The practicality of such generally applicable plasmid would be further extended if the corresponding common gRNA for the in-cell cleavage of the plasmid was also placed into the GFP-plasmid. Further we refer to plasmids constructed in this way as ‘self-cleaving’, since such plasmids, expressing the gRNA with its own target, are programmed to initiate their own cleavage (Fig. 2A). (A) Scheme of the genomic integration of a self-cleaving plasmid. The target sequence of the gRNA (magenta) expressed from the SpCas9 plasmid is present only in the genome (magenta target in the grey double helix). The circular plasmid that contains a GFP-box (green) harbours a genomic-targetless gRNA (TL gRNA) and its target sequence (blue boxes). During repair of the broken genomic DNA, the opened plasmid will efficiently integrate into the genome at the cleavage site even in the absence of homologous arms. Such construction of the GFP-plasmid does not require retailoring the protospacer for every new genomic target and can be universally used. (B) The efficiency of targeted integration when using self-cleaving GFP-plasmid in N2a cells. The percentages of the cells harbouring a stably integrated GFP-cassette are shown. The Rbl2 or Ttn genes were targeted by the corresponding gRNAs, Rb or Ttn, respectively. Cells were co-transfected by the expression vector for both wild type SpCas9 and a respective gRNA, and either of the self-cleaving circular GFP-plasmids pSc1 or pSc2 or the circular GFP-plasmid containing the Rb or Ttn protospacer (Rb-InCell, Ttn-InCell) or without containing any target sequence (Rb or Ttn, Circ). To measure the random integration background of the self-cleaving plasmids, they were co-transfected with a vector expressing active SpCas9 and the corresponding TL gRNAs; thus, the genome is not targeted, but the self-cleaving plasmids are linearized (TL1, TL2). As an additional negative control, an inactive SpCas9 was used along with either of the two self-cleaving plasmids (dead). Bars show the means ± S.D. of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections, which were normalized to the transfection efficiency (% GFP positive cells measured on 2nd day after transfection: ranging between 94 and 96%).(A) Scheme of the genomic integration of a self-cleaving plasmid.

The Rbl2 or Ttn genes were targeted by the corresponding gRNAs, Rb or Ttn, respectively. Cells were co-transfected by the expression vector for both wild type SpCas9 and a respective gRNA, and either of the self-cleaving circular GFP-plasmids pSc1 or pSc2 or the circular GFP-plasmid containing the Rb or Ttn protospacer (Rb-InCell, Ttn-InCell) or without containing any target sequence (Rb or Ttn, Circ). To measure the random integration background of the self-cleaving plasmids, they were co-transfected with a vector expressing active SpCas9 and the corresponding TL gRNAs; thus, the genome is not targeted, but the self-cleaving plasmids are linearized (TL1, TL2). As an additional negative control, an inactive SpCas9 was used along with either of the two self-cleaving plasmids (dead). Bars show the means ± S.D. of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections, which were normalized to the transfection efficiency (% GFP positive cells measured on 2nd day after transfection: ranging between 94 and 96%).To prepare such effective GFP-plasmids for general use, we computer-generated a pool of 30,000 random spacer sequences and picked the ones that have the least predicted off-targets in the mouse genome as assessed by e-CRISP Cas9 construct designer53 and had the best predicted efficiency by sgRNA Designer.16,21 From these, two candidates were picked that according to the CasFinder54 have no targets in the human genome and in 11 frequently employed model organisms (mouse, rat, cat, dog, pig, cow, chicken, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae) thus, reserving the potential to be used more generally for self-cleaving GFP-plasmids in different cell lines/organisms (although, we do not explore these possibilities here). We refer to these as TL (targetless) spacers, TL1 and TL2; these two spacer sequences were used to generate two ‘self-cleaving’ GFP-plasmids (referred to as pSc1 and pSc2, respectively - Addgene #80436, #80437) containing both the TL spacer/gRNA and the corresponding protospacer on one vector (Fig. 2A).We tested the targeted integration of the two self-cleaving plasmids in combination with either the Ttn or Rb-gRNA in comparison with the Ttn and Rb cleaved in-cell linearized plasmid (Fig. 2B, indicated as Rb-, Ttn-InCell), as earlier. As a control, TL-gRNA bearing plasmids were co-transfected with either of the two self-cleaving plasmids; thus, the GFP-plasmid is linearized in-cell without the genome being targeted. These experiments demonstrate that the self-cleaving plasmids achieve comparable integrations with the two in-cell cleaved GFP-plasmids in case of both genome-targeting (Ttn or Rb) gRNAs tested. This suggests that both gRNAs containing TL spacers (TL-gRNAs) support as efficient plasmid DNA cleavage as the Rb or Ttn spacers do. Thus, these self-cleaving plasmids seem to facilitate efficient integration, while providing a more adequate assessment of efficiencies of different gRNAs.The two self-cleaving GFP-plasmids pSc1 and pSc2 were further used to test 11 spacers, targeting 7 different mouse genes [Pten,55,Rbl2, Tp53,55Prnp, Sprn, Piwil2, and Piwil4 (Fig. 3A and B)]. Targeted integration is assessed here as the fluorescence above the background level that derives from the random integration of the in-cell cleaved self-cleaving plasmid. For this control sample the gRNA, which is identical to the corresponding TL-gRNA of the self-cleaving plasmid is placed to the SpCas9 plasmid; thus, the GFP-plasmid is linearized in-cell without the genome being targeted. The random integration of these in-cell-cleaved GFP cassettes is usually about 4–5%, which is higher than the random integration of a circular (1–2%) or even a linear (2–3.5%) plasmid. The nearly 2% increment likely come from an increased propensity of the in-cell cleaved plasmid for random integration, although a contribution also from off-target cleavage activity of the TL guides cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, these values—although, may vary among cell types—are sufficiently low to allow the detection of targeted integration above this background level fluorescence. The efficiency of different spacers to mediate targeted integration when used with self-cleaving GFP-plasmids in N2a cells. The efficiencies of different spacers in targeted integration using the pSc1 (A) or pSc2 (B) self-cleaving GFP-plasmid are assessed. The percentages of the cells harbouring stably integrated GFP-cassette were measured for 11 different spacers (pten, Rb, p53, prp1-5, sho, piwi1-2) targeting seven genes (Pten, Rbl2, Tp53, Prnp, Sprn, Piwil4, Piwil2) as indicated by the light grey bars, when co-transfecting with either the circular pSc1 (A) or pSc2 (B) self-cleaving GFP-plasmids. To measure the random integration background of the self-cleaving plasmids, they were co-transfected with a vector expressing active SpCas9 and the corresponding TL gRNA; thus, the genome is not targeted, but the self-cleaving plasmids are linearized (genome not targeted, Sc1 in-cell cleaved; A and B, indicated by the dashed lines). Bars show the means ± S.D. of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections, which were normalized to the transfection efficiency (% GFP positive cells measured on 2nd day after transfection: ranging between 94 and 98%).

Experiments with the least effective spacer piwi2, (indicated as ‘piwi2’, Fig. 3) resulted in no clearly detectable targeted integrations that would exceed random integration of an in-cell cleaved plasmid. By contrast, the pten spacer (indicated as ‘pten’, Fig. 3) was by far the most effective with both self-cleaving plasmids mediating targeted integration of around 25%. The two self-cleaving GFP-plasmids supported targeted integrations in a similar fashion in combination with the 11 spacers. To test the presence of targeted integrations, we performed PCR using one primer complementary to the end of the plasmid and another one complementary to the genomic locus, on DNA samples purified from the stably transfected cell populations. Testing on the Pten locus agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the plasmids were incorporated at both orientations to the target site (Supplementary Fig. S3). Direct sequencing of the PCR products in case of integration at a different locus (Tp53), demonstrated that a considerable fraction of the integrations took place by error-free NHEJ repair (Supplementary Fig. S4) as it had also been reported earlier for blunt ended NHEJ-cloning.38,46In another experiment, additional seven gRNAs (targeting the mouse Vim and Dcun1d2 genes) were tested along with those targeting Pten, Rbl2, and Ttn, with both the wild type and the enhanced SpCas9 (eSpCas9) (Supplementary Fig. S5). While for Rb and Ttn both nucleases showed comparable efficiencies and for four other gRNAs (all that target Dcun1d2 and with vim1 spacer) neither of the nucleases showed efficient cleavage compared to their controls, with another four wtSpCas9 produced higher rates of targeted integrations while eSpCas9 showed low or no activity, which most probably is attributable in part to the higher specificity of eSpCas9.3.3. The universal self-cleaving GFP-plasmid approach compares to an HR-based fluorescence reporter method and it is also effective in NIH/3T3, HeLa, and HEK293 cellsWe compared the relative efficiencies of four prion protein gene-targeting spacers to result either HR or NHEJ mediated targeted integration of a GFP-cassette flanked by either 1 kb-long homology arms or no homologous sequences, respectively. The latter is present in the pSc1 plasmid (Fig. 4). We selected genomic targets whose cleavage sites are situated within a few base pairs in order to minimize the effect of the distances between cleavage sites of SpCas9 and the beginning of the homologous region, on the efficiency of HR-mediated targeted integration. Two of the cleavage sites (prp2, prp3) were situated in a few nucleotide distances from the end of the upstream and two other (prp4, prp5) from the beginning of the downstream HR arms, respectively. Both HR and NHEJ mediated integrations indicated that both target pairs can be efficiently cleaved by SpCas9. Interestingly, in case of the upstream site gRNAs (prp2 and -3) prp2 seems to be more effective than prp3 when assessed by NHEJ-mediated integration that is not apparent in the HR-mediated assay. Efficiency of integration of the self-cleaving plasmid to the genome is comparable to that of a HR-mediated integration. The percentages of the cells harbouring a stably integrated GFP-cassette (without normalization to the transfection efficiency) are shown for four different spacers targeting the Prnp gene (prp2-5). Cells were co-transfected by an active SpCas9 and the respective gRNA expressing vector along with either of the following GFP-plasmids: a homologous recombination (HR) donor GFP-plasmid (empty bars) containing a promoter-less GFP gene with 1 kb homologous arms for the Prnp gene at both sides of the GFP-cassette; or the self-cleaving GFP-plasmid pSc1 (grey bars). As a control for the HR mediated integrations, the HR donor plasmid was co-transfected with an inactive SpCas9 expression vector (dead Cas9). The values obtained for this control (0.1%) indicated as random integration background with HR, was subtracted from all corresponding sample values to determine the extent of targeted integrations. For experiments with the self-cleaving plasmid, the control used was the self-cleaving plasmid pSc1 co-transfected with a vector expressing active SpCas9 and the TL1 gRNA and thus, the pSc1 plasmid is linearized in-cell but the genome is not targeted (indicated as random integration background with pSc1 donor). The value obtained for this control (5%) was subtracted from all corresponding sample values to determine the extent of net targeted integrations. Values were not normalized for transfection efficiency in either experiments.

The percentages of the cells harbouring a stably integrated GFP-cassette (without normalization to the transfection efficiency) are shown for four different spacers targeting the Prnp gene (prp2-5). Cells were co-transfected by an active SpCas9 and the respective gRNA expressing vector along with either of the following GFP-plasmids: a homologous recombination (HR) donor GFP-plasmid (empty bars) containing a promoter-less GFP gene with 1 kb homologous arms for the Prnp gene at both sides of the GFP-cassette; or the self-cleaving GFP-plasmid pSc1 (grey bars).

The value obtained for this control (5%) was subtracted from all corresponding sample values to determine the extent of net targeted integrations. Values were not normalized for transfection efficiency in either experiments. Bars show the means ± S.D. of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections.In another experiment, we selected and cloned 5 spacers targeting the Rosa26 locus in the mouse genome (one of them, rosa5 spacer previously reported in ref.56). The five gRNAs seem to mediate comparable cleavage efficiencies (about 10–20%) by both approaches (Supplementary Fig. S6), although the target sites were not so carefully selected as in case of Figure 4 and thus, the relative position of the targets may have influenced their efficiency in the HR-mediated assay.HR-mediated integration is currently the only approach used in fluorescence-based methods that are capable of testing the genomic targets in their genomic context (GFP-disruption and analogous assays are restricted to targets aimed at the GFP sequences). However, the HR-mediated method is much more laborious due to the need to construct the homologous arms. Therefore, it is only worth to apply it for screening gRNA-efficiencies if the eventual application is to employ the same homologous arms. Thus, the advantages of our approach over other fluorescence-based methods for gRNA testing are apparent and it may be more relevant to compare to PCR-based methods what we present later in the manuscript.Further experimentation on NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells with one of the self-cleaving plasmids and seven spacers of the set previously tested in N2a cells, targeting five genes (Pten, Rbl2, Tp53, Prnp, and Piwil4) resulted in sufficiently high targeted integrations (i.e. for the majority of the spacers clearly measurable above the background 5%) (Supplementary Fig. S7A). The most effective spacer, pten resulted in close to 15% targeted integration, whereas piwi2 showed no detectable targeted integration. Thus, these results recapitulate those seen earlier with these spacers in N2a cells and suggest that our approach is applicable in NIH/3T3 mouse cells as well.The TL spacers have neither targets nor predicted off-targets in the human genome, allowing us therefore, to test the applicability of our approach on human cells as well. The commonly used human cell line HeLa was selected, using one of the two self-cleaving plasmids (pSc1). We could not use most of the mouse gene-targeting spacers tested earlier in N2a cells on the corresponding human genomic sites; however, we recognized that the pten spacer also targets the human PTEN gene and PTENP1 pseudogene. In addition, two other spacers that target the human PRNP gene were designed. While the in-cell linearized plasmid background remained at 1.4%, the two prion protein targeting spacers and the pten spacer mediate targeted integrations (i.e. above background level) from 5% to 15%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Additionally, four previously reported active gRNAs57 were tested in HEK293 cells targeting the LMNA and PML genes along with the gRNA targeting the PTEN gene. All spacers mediated effective targeted integrations (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Altogether, these results on different cell lines (N2a, NIH/3T3, HeLa, and HEK293) suggest that NHEJ-mediated targeted integration in combination with these self-cleaving plasmids is sufficiently high above random integration to exploit it for testing gRNA efficiency more generally.3.4. Shortening detection time with a degradation domain fused to GFPAlthough these experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach requiring little effort and cost, the long time-frame necessary for obtaining the readout limits its use. Our experiments suggested that the long decay time of the transient signal originates from the high stability of GFP protein molecules that are present after the disappearance of the plasmid DNA. To avoid this effect, ideally, GFP expression should be induced after the degradation of the transfected plasmid DNA in the cell, ensuring that the GFP expression originates only from the integrated copies of the expression cassette. We achieved a similar outcome by fusing a degradation domain (DD), a destabilized mutant of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) protein to GFP that drives faster degradation of the fluorescent protein. The degradation domain is stabilized in the presence of trimethoprim (TMP), preventing enhanced degradation.50 Adding TMP to the cells after the transfected plasmid DNA has disappeared allows the detection of the GFP signal originating only from proteins expressed from the integrated copies.Fusing the degradation domain either to the N- or to the C- terminus of GFP resulted similar expression profiles (data not shown), thus, we selected the N-terminal fusion for further experiments and placed it to a self-cleaving plasmid (pSc1-DD, Addgene #80439). Three gRNAs tested previously, Rb, p53, and piwi2 (the first two representing efficient, whereas the third poor gRNAs) were exploited to adjust the condition of the modified assay employing pSc1-DD. The gRNA-Cas9 plasmids were co-transfected with both the pSc1-DD plasmid and an mCherry coding plasmid to N2a cells. The latter allows for monitoring the transfection efficiencies. To determine the earliest time point that is appropriate for distinguishing between poor and active gRNA-s, GFP positive cells were measured daily from the 2nd to the 10th day post transfection (data not shown). TMP was added to all samples 24 h before FACS analysis. The gRNAs tested previously with the pSc1 and pSc2 plasmids (Fig. 3), now with pSc1-DD showed similar activities. This approach resulted in the successful reduction of the assay time from 12–15 to 6–8 days (Fig. 5). The activities of the gRNAs are clearly distinct (i.e. the poor and good gRNAs can be easily distinguished) on the 6th day post transfection, although the fluorescence stabilizes only from the 8th day (data not shown). Shortening detection time with a degradation domain fused to GFP. The percentages of the cells harbouring stably integrated GFP-cassette were measured between 6 and 8 days after transfection when a self-cleaving plasmid with a degradation domain-fused GFP (pSc1-DD) was co-transfected with three formerly used (e.g. Fig. 3) SpCas9-gRNA coding plasmids (targeting the Rbl2, Tp53 and Piwil4 genes) and an mCherry coding plasmid (to track transfection efficiency) to N2a cells. To stabilize the degradation domain, trimethoprim was added to the cells 24 h before FACS analysis. As controls, the pSc1-DD plasmid was co-transfected with either (I) a nuclease inactive SpCas9 coding plasmid (dead); or (II) with an active SpCas9 and the TL1 gRNA expressing vector and thus, the pSc1 plasmid is linearized in-cell but the genome is not targeted (indicated as genome not targeted pSc1-DD in cell cut). Bars show the means ± S.D. of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections, which were normalized to the transfection efficiency [% mCherry positive cells (ranging between 44 and 52%) measured on the 2nd day after transfection].Shortening detection time with a degradation domain fused to GFP.

The approach is also validated by two PCR-based methods: TIDE and T7 endonuclease I assayTen spacer sequences targeting six genes in the mouse genome (four for Prnp, two for Pten, and one for Dcun1d2, Rbl2, Tp53, and Piwil4 genes), were selected for a comparison of this approach and indel detection methods such as Tracking Indels by Decomposition (TIDE33) and T7 endonuclease I assay. These 10 gRNA-Cas9 plasmids were used for co-transfection with the pSc1-DD plasmid into N2a cells. Genomic DNA from the FACS-analysed cells was extracted on the 8th day post transfection and the SpCas9 targeted sites were PCR amplified and indels were detected by both TIDE and T7 endonuclease I assay. All approaches, this reporter assay, TIDE and T7 endonuclease I assay identified the same five gRNAs as being the more efficient ones (pten, pten2, p53, Rb, and prp2) and the same five gRNAs to result low or no cleavage activities (prp8, prp9, prp10, piwi2, and dcun1d2) (Fig. 6). However, as expected, the relative efficiencies among the gRNAs slightly differed, likely reflecting the differences in the outcomes of the competing repair events they monitor.

In-cell cleavage of a linear plasmid does not recapitulate the same level of integration as in-cell cleavage of a circular plasmidIt is not clear why in-cell cleavage of circular plasmids promotes more efficient integration as compared to transfection of linear, i.e.: out-of-cell cleaved ones (we refer to this as pre-linearized plasmids). One explanation could be that linear DNA is more prone to degradation and a large proportion of the transfected DNA is digested before its targeted integration can take place. Alternatively, the end of the linear molecule might become integration incompetent with time, for example by concatemerization. It is also possible that NHEJ ligation may preferentially take place among DNA ends that are liberated at the same time. To get more insight into this problem we compared NHEJ-mediated targeted integration of pre-linearized plasmids either cleaving or not cleaving them again in-cell. in-cell cleavage of the pre-linearized plasmids apparently does not increase targeted integration whereas in-cell linearization of the circular plasmid (resulting in one fragment) facilitated twice as many targeted integrations as pre-linearization (Fig. 7). Integration efficiency of the in-cell cleaved pre-linearized plasmid is lower than that of the in-cell cleaved circular plasmid in N2a cells. The percentages of the cells harbouring stably integrated GFP-cassette are shown when targeting two different genes, Ttn or Rbl2 with the spacers Ttn or Rb, respectively, as indicated. In case of either of the targets, the cells were co-transfected by an expression vector for nuclease active SpCas9 (+) and the respective gRNA (Rb or Ttn) along with: (I) a circular GFP-plasmid containing two matching protospacers ( ++) before and after the GFP-cassette (dark green bars; as seen formerly in Fig. 1A); (II) a pre-linearized GFP-plasmid containing two matching protospacers ( ++) before and after the GFP-cassette (light green bars); (III) a pre-linearized GFP-plasmid containing no protospacers (magenta bars). For both spacers as a negative control a nuclease inactive SpCas9 (-) and gRNA expressing plasmid was co-transfected with a pre-linearized GFP-plasmid (grey bars). For the in-cell linearized plasmid, as a control, a circular plasmid with no matching protospacer was co-transfected with Rb spacer and SpCas9 expressing vector, therefore, the plasmid cannot be linearized in the cell (sky blue bar). As an additional control a circular GFP-plasmid was co-transfected with inactive SpCas9 nuclease expressing vector (orange). Bars show the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections which were normalized to the transfection efficiency (% GFP positive cells measured on 2nd day after transfection: ranging between 95 and 99%).Integration efficiency of the in-cell cleaved pre-linearized plasmid is lower than that of the in-cell cleaved circular plasmid in N2a cells.

Bars show the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of percentages measured in n = 3 independent transfections which were normalized to the transfection efficiency (% GFP positive cells measured on 2nd day after transfection: ranging between 95 and 99%).Since in-cell double cleavage (where the restriction enzyme linearized plasmid is cleaved both upstream and downstream the GFP-cassette), may effectively triple the number of DNA molecules with free ends, it might adversely affect the integration efficiency of the fragment containing the GFP-cassette having to compete for the available genomic DNA breaks. To account for this effect, we repeated the experiments, now using controls of pre-linearized plasmids digested into one, two or three pieces. The linear plasmids were also cleaved again once or twice in-cell generating either two or three fragments, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9). Pre-linearization of the plasmids into two or three pieces before transfection decreased targeted integration, as expected. in-cell cleavage of the pre-linearized plasmid into two or three pieces facilitated targeted integration twice as much as pre-linearization of the plasmids into two or three pieces before transfection. However, no significant differences were seen when the pre-linearized plasmid was cut once or twice in-cell (Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus, in-cell cleavage of pre-linearized plasmid failed to increase targeted integration to a similar level as the in-cell cleavage of a circular DNA. These experiments suggest that the major reason for the increased targeted integration of in-cell cleaved circular plasmids in N2a cells is the higher resistance to nucleases, although these experiments do not rule out a positive contribution from a synchronized in-cell cleavage.3.7. NHEJ-cloning employing SpCas9 and a self-cleaving plasmid is superior to random integrationTargeted integration of plasmids as large as 5 kb by NHEJ-cloning using SpCas9, had also been demonstrated in mammalian cells, although, with limited efficiency.45 We used a self-cleaving plasmid to assess if NHEJ-cloning is capable of targeted integration of 10 kb plasmids with sufficient efficiency. A 5 kb cassette was cloned to the self-cleaving plasmid (resulting in 10805 bp final size) and its integration was tested with the most effective spacer (pten) used in these studies. We found 30% and 18% targeted integration (without normalization for the transfection efficiency i.e.: without upscaling to 100%) of the 10 kb plasmid harbouring a GFP-cassette in N2a and HeLa cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S10A and B). These experiments suggest that the size of the plasmid in this range is not a limiting factor for NHEJ-cloning in these cell lines.The efficiencies we achieved here for targeted integrations are almost an order of magnitude higher than those reported earlier in HEK293 cells without using a self-cleaving plasmid.45 To see if the differences are attributable only to the different cell lines (N2a, NIH/3T3, HeLa vs. HEK293, and CHO) used, we tested our approach on HEK293 cells as well. The experiments presented on Supplementary Fig. S10C demonstrate that by using self-cleaving plasmids (either 5 or 10 kb large), efficient integrations are achievable in HEK293 cells, showing more than an order of magnitude higher efficiencies than seen in earlier studies [7% targeted integration here (Supplementary Fig. S10C) vs. 0.17% in Ref. 45]. These results were confirmed later exploiting more targets (Supplementary Fig. S7C).Our experiments suggest that NHEJ-cloning using SpCas9 nuclease with a self-cleaving plasmid could be a superior alternative to random integration of DNA cassettes. To establish an easy way for integration of DNA cassettes to safe-harbour locations, we identified 5 spacers targeting the Rosa26 locus in the mouse genome, as discussed earlier (Supplementary Fig. S6).We also examined whether NHEJ-cloning of a self-cleaving plasmid would result in coupled integration of two expression cassettes harboured on the same plasmid. This is a major concern exploiting random integration where selection for an antibiotic does not always result in expression of the target gene located on the same plasmid. N2a cells were co-transfected with two plasmids: one is a self-cleaving plasmid containing both a GFP and a puromycin expression cassette (pSc1-puro, Addgene #80438) and the other is a plasmid for SpCas9 and gRNA expression targeting the PTEN gene. The fraction of cells exhibiting GFP fluorescence was counted by FACS after 10 days of puromycin selection when the transient GFP expression had been decayed. These experiments demonstrated about 90% coupled integration of the puromycin and the GFP expression cassettes by NHEJ-cloning of a self-cleaving plasmid. By contrast, this value is 50% for coupled random integration in the same experimental setup but without cleaving the plasmid and the genome (Supplementary Fig. S11). This latter experiment resulted in two orders of magnitude less resistant cells indicating the higher efficiency of NHEJ-cloning.4. DiscussionIn the absence of accurate prediction tools for the efficiency of Cas9 spacers, suitable gRNAs can only be selected reliably by experimental testing. Although several approaches exist to measure the activity of SpCas9-gRNAs,24 there is an absence of simple fluorescence-based methods that would be able to assess the effectivity of gRNAs on targets in their genomic context while ensuring an easy and reliable detection by FACS. Here, we introduced a method that fulfils this gap and offers a simple alternative to existing approaches for testing gRNA efficiencies prior to executing more complex applications like generating specifically modified cell lines, transgenic animals or performing multiplex genome engineering tasks. As it requires only the ready gRNAs, our method can be applied by simply co-transfecting the Cas9-gRNA plasmids with a self-cleaving reporter plasmid. Thus, it does not require extra cloning steps for testing a particular gRNA in contrast to other fluorescent reporter-based methods.35,39,40,42 In Table 1, we compared the self-cleaving plasmid reporter method to other FACS- and PCR-based methods. Although, the exact numbers for some of the parameters may vary from lab-to-lab making an absolute comparison difficult, considering optimal instances for each, the self-cleaving method presents numerous advantages over the other methods. FACS-based methods are inherently less labor-consuming than PCR based methods. As far as optimization is concerned, here only a new cell line may present a need for optimization, which for our technique refers to adjusting the parameters of a FACS device. However, if the transfection efficiency is also measured when a PCR-based approach is applied (generally and most easily by exploiting a fluorescent protein and FACS), no extra optimization is necessary, in this sense, for our method. By contrast, PCR-based approaches require some optimization of the primers and PCR condition for each target region selected. Thus, it seems to be a favourable alternative approach for those who do not mind the longer time-frame in exchange for spending less effort on gRNA testing. Comparison of methods that can detect Cas9 nuclease induced DNA mutationsThe self-cleaving plasmid method is compared to some of the PCR- and FACS-based assays’ most relevant attributes, which can detect Cas9 nuclease induced mutations. The cost and time calculations are available in detail in Supplementary Data. Favourable conditions are marked with white and less favourable conditions are marked with grey backgrounds.Comparison of methods that can detect Cas9 nuclease induced DNA mutationsThe self-cleaving plasmid method is compared to some of the PCR- and FACS-based assays’ most relevant attributes, which can detect Cas9 nuclease induced mutations. The cost and time calculations are available in detail in Supplementary Data. Favourable conditions are marked with white and less favourable conditions are marked with grey backgrounds.Another built-in advantage of the method is that the transfection efficiencies can easily be determined by simply measuring the GFP fluorescence of a portion of each population on the second day post transfection. While the transfection efficiency influences the readout of any gRNA-testing method to a great extent, it is generally not monitored in most of the studies using either PCR- or fluorescence-based methods.58,59The targeted integration of the GFP-cassette can be assessed only after the transient expression has decayed. The use of an inducible degradation domain fused to GFP decreased this time to 6–8 days, a time-period that is less than what is usually needed for deep sequencing, but it is slightly longer than that required for measuring indel frequency by Surveyor/T7E1 assay (Table 1).24 The extent of the random integration also seems to vary with the condition of the cells; this makes necessary the use of appropriate negative controls such as non-targeted integration of the in-cell cleaved plasmid, in each experiment.The method measures the targeted integration to sites of genomic cleavage identified by the gRNA. Thus, it does not distinguish between on-target and off-target cleavage. However, off-target cleavage can generally be kept low with the careful design of the spacer sequence and using improved SpCas9 nucleases with reduced off-target effect, such as eSpCas9 (Supplementary Fig. S5) or SpCas9-HF.60,61The extent and nature of the correlation between generating double strand breaks and integrating exogenous DNA by NHEJ repair is difficult to assess since there is no easily available method to directly measure the formation of double strand breaks in the cells. Most approaches are based on detecting those outcomes of the repairs of double strand DNA breaks that result in altered sequences.24 However, the exact correlation between the number of double strand breaks and detectable repair events (i.e. repairs resulting in altered sequences) are not known for any of the approaches designed to monitor it. As such, they depend on many factors, for instance, the actual DNA sequence at the break and the position and presence of microhomologies that are thought to greatly influence the ratio of error-free to non-error-free NHEJ repair.62–64 The conditions and factors that influence the ratio of HR to NHEJ mediated repair are also difficult to account for.25 In addition, both main repair systems are capable of capturing foreign DNA at the break points, although the factors that may influence this are also poorly understood, for instance the ratio of NHEJ-mediated integration and indel generating NHEJ repair. In addition, the actual methods used might not accurately measure the frequency of mutations generated by the repair system. For example, it is not fully understood how the distribution and nature of the mutations in the indel population affect the outcome of the Surveyor/T7E1 nucleases assays.65,66 Furthermore, PCR-based methods generally ignore larger deletions or insertions of which frequencies might also influence the number of smaller indels detected.24 Thus, it is not apparent that the relative efficiencies of spacers would be identical when assessed with two different methods. Nevertheless, all approaches are likely to be suitable for a rough estimation to distinguish very poor from efficient spacers.Here, we measured NHEJ mediated and HR mediated targeted integration using the same sets of gRNAs (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S6). The gRNAs were designed to minimize the positional effects of the target position in relation to the homologous arms. Although there might be several other factors difficult to account for, this allowed a more direct comparison of the gRNA efficiencies to induce DNA repair by the two repair systems. The method was also compared to both TIDE and T7 endonuclease I assays that measure indel frequencies induced by SpCas9 cleavage employing an identical set of gRNAs. These experiments confirmed that our approach is capable of distinguishing poor and efficient spacer sequences and is a useful, effortless alternative for screening for more efficient gRNAs.The method absolutely requires in-cell cleavage of the GFP-plasmid to be integrated. Occasionally, we were able to detect targeted integration of pre-linearized plasmids above the background random integration with some spacers (Fig. 7); however, these were neither reproducible nor robust enough to base a method on. The underlying exact mechanism for the integration of the in-cell cleaved plasmids is not well understood. To distinguish between alternative scenarios, we in-cell re-cleaved the pre-linearized plasmid (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. S9). These experiments seem to indicate that the major factor for the difference is that circular DNAs are more resistant to cellular DNases than the linear ones are. However, it is still not clear that by increasing the linear DNA pool in the cell, available for integration to the competing double strand breaks, why the in-cell cleaved plasmid is preferred to be integrated (at proportionally higher rates) to nuclease-generated over to endogenous DSBs (Fig. 1B) when one compares this to circular or pre-linearized plasmids (Supplementary Fig. S2).The key step of the method is to use a self-cleaving plasmid that provides both controlled and standardized in-cell cleavage and enhanced integration of the plasmid. Another important feature lies in the use of targetless, low-background and effective spacers. The former characteristic was achieved by exploring some 30000 spacers and it is necessary for the low background we observed, as well as for general applicability. The latter probably increases the sensitivity of our method, that is in accord with Auer et al. showing that more efficient cleavage of the donor plasmid results in higher targeted integration in zebrafish.38Our work also demonstrates an efficient way for targeted integration of DNA cassettes in mammalian cells without laborious construction of homologous arms although without base pair precision. Based on earlier studies it was not clear if NHEJ-cloning is also effective in mammalian cells following SpCas9 cleavage that generates blunt ends. In attempts to enhance its efficiency, a few approaches used compatible overhangs or edited microhomology (8 bases-long) to the DSB site.43,44,52,67 Auer et al., building on the high activity of NHEJ in zebrafish embryos,68–70 demonstrated high efficiency of NHEJ-cloning without any overhangs or edited microhomology.38 However, when SpCas9 was used in mammalian cells for NHEJ-cloning of a donor plasmid without any overhangs or edited microhomology, none of the attempts demonstrated highly efficient targeted integration (0.17% and 0.45% or about 1%, in HEK and CHO or HAP1 cells, respectively).45,46 Here, we successfully demonstrated that NHEJ-cloning coupled with a self-cleaving donor plasmid without any pre-selection or FACS-enrichments can be effectively applied (with up to 20–30% efficiency of integration) to mammalian cells as well.A recent study demonstrated targeted integration of expression cassettes amplified by PCR, and reached targeted integration of mCherry-containing cassettes between 1 and 5%.59 this is in agreement with our results presented here using linear plasmids (Fig. 7; Supplementary Figs S2 and S9). Interestingly, using the smaller and brighter protein Clover, about 20% integrations were reported suggesting that transfection of a linear donor DNA less than 2 kilobase, might integrate more efficiently. While it is very promising, in the absence of measuring the actual transfection efficiencies, the widely different amounts of DNA used for transfections of samples and controls, and in the absence of monitoring the decay of the transient fluorescence with an appropriate inactive dCas9 control, it is difficult to assess the real impact of these results. Another work demonstrated homology independent integration, donor DNA knock-in not only in cell culture model systems but in vivo as well.71NHEJ-cloning is a useful tool for targeted integration when there is no need for absolute precise joining of the DNA ends or when a selection can be applied for the proper joining. Since the DNA fragment can be inserted in two orientations and in three frames, only some of the targeted integration events would result from in frame incorporation of the donor DNA, depending on whether precise NHEJ dominates over error-prone NHEJ or whether the actual sequences prefer certain deletions/insertion over others. Thus, it seems that it is generally not efficient enough for easy protein tagging without selection. Even so, a few studies reported successful application of NHEJ-cloning to tag endogenous proteins using fluorescent protein or other selectable markers.46,67,72 Nevertheless, it might be more suitable for IRES tagging that is without much sensitivity for base pair-precise insertion and thus, about every second targeted integration (one of the two orientations of the inserted DNA) is appropriate for proper tagging, provided that sufficiently high activity gRNAs are employed. It is important to note that, using only one site for in-cell linearization also results in the incorporation of bacterial, ‘junk’ DNA. In applications where avoiding the integration of ‘junk’ DNA is preferable, a more precise integration of the target gene/DNA cassette can also be achieved by employing the design on Figure 1A, using two cleavage sites as also demonstrated by Nakade et al. and Lackner et al.46,72 A specifically attractive approach, CRISPaint was developed recently, by which both the integration of the plasmid-cleaving gRNA into the target genomic site and, by applying DNA minicircles, the insertion of bacterial DNA can be avoided.73NHEJ-cloning is especially attractive for its potential as a superior substitute for random integration, to incorporate DNA cassettes to safe-harbour sites in the genome—avoiding the positional effects of the insertion—frequently encountered using random integration and the laborious work for constructing homologous arms. It can be more effective by at least one order of magnitude than random integration and provides stronger coupling between target and marker genes (Supplementary Fig. S11), facilitating a more reliable identification of the proper clones. Another attractive application of it is the creation of loss-of-function alleles by the easy targeting of DNA at endogenous loci. Using self-cleaving plasmids to disrupt genes is comparably effective to out-of-frame indel-generation methods with the added advantage of the invalidated alleles being labeled.5. ConclusionWe demonstrated a versatile, yet simple approach for the identification of the effective gRNAs using a fluorescent reporter assay with self-cleaving plasmids. The method is capable of testing targets in their genomic context and requires no extra cloning steps. While it needs about 4 days longer to get the results, the method requires considerably less hands-on time and it certainly will be favoured by researchers who wish to avoid the use of the ‘gold-standard’ T7/Surveyor assays. This method might generally be used for other RNA-guided designer nucleases as well, such as Cas9-s from other species and Cpf1 nucleases. Additionally, we showed that NHEJ-cloning can also be used in mammalian cells for targeted integration of donor plasmids up to 10 kb in size, with up to 30% efficiency, without any selection or enrichment. Its further advantages as compared to random integrations include being much more effective and being able to provide stronger coupling of two DNA cassettes, such as the one to be integrated and a selection marker.We would like to thank György Várady and Izabel Patik for helping with the FACS measurements, Lucia Illy, Judit Tálas and Zsófia Molnár for critical reading and suggestions to the manuscript and Ildikó Pulinka Szucsné, Judit Szucs and Luca Xénia Turgyán for technical assistance.

IntroductionTranslation initiation, elongation and termination involve many factors, that balance translation rate (speed) and accuracy.1,2 The final translation efficiency for a given protein is restricted by the cost of its production and organization.3 Therefore, evolving a genome-wide translation regulation regime can efficiently determine the translation rates of various genes under different conditions.1 Conventional computations of translation elongation efficiency refer to codon usage4 and tRNA availability.5 The relationship between codon usage and tRNA abundance predicts translation efficiency with reasonable accuracy.1Additional theories have been proposed with constantly emerging experimental technologies6,7 to cope with challenges to the simplified assumptions about translation described above. Thus, the effects of codon order,8–10 local tRNA availability,11–13 regulation of expression of the tRNA gene,14 the diverse demands of the transcriptomes,9,15 ribosomes,16 mRNA structures17–19 and folding energy20 were included in the translation efficiency models. Among these factors, tRNA availability repeatedly emphasized decides the supply of aminoacyl-tRNA,21 which influences the translocation of ribosomes on mRNA.22–25 Nutriment limitations, such as amino acid shortage, also have influences on the cellular supply of aminoacyl-tRNA.26 However, how the formation of aminoacyl-tRNA influences translation efficiency is still unclear.In the translation process, tRNAs can be thought of as tools and the amino acids as the raw materials. Each species of tRNA corresponds to a particular amino acid, and each of the former is responsible for carrying one of the latter. We hypothesize that the levels of the tRNAs and the corresponding amino acids should be well matched to synthesize proteins more efficiently. Such a consistency would maximize efficiency and minimize resource/energy costs.Here, we firstly examined the association between the tRNA gene copy numbers and amino acid compositions in various organisms. We sought to validate two points of reasoning: at the organismal scale, most organisms evolve co-adaption between tRNA gene copy number and amino acid composition; and at the second scale of individual proteins, the co-adaption intensity may vary among the proteins within an organism. Some proteins need to be expressed rapidly to maintain a high quantity or to satisfy the requirements of acute responses. We speculated that such proteins would have higher co-adaption to increase their translation efficiency. Computational analyses were employed to elucidate co-adaption between tRNA gene copy numbers and amino acid usage for proteins/proteomes in three domains of life, indicating the effects of maximum efficiency and the minimum cost principle. Then, we further correlated the co-adaption with proteins’ translation rates, which were validated by growth rates of bacteria and production rates of target proteins. The target proteins’ translation rates were observed to be lifted through changing the proportions of gene copy numbers of tRNAs, providing clues for applied biology.2. Materials and methods2.1. E. coli strain and methodsDNA amplification and expression were performed in E. coli Top10 cells (F- mcrA <U+0394>(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) F80lacZ<U+0394>M15 <U+0394> lacX74 recA1 araD139 <U+0394>(araleu)7697 galU galK rpsL (StrR) endA1 nupG). All bacterial media and methods used in this study were as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.272.2. Production of synthetic genesOligonucleotides were synthesized using PCR amplification. The fragments were recombined to generate the target coding sequences, which were inserted behind the arabinose promoter. Positive clones were screened by resistance screening and confirmed by PCR and sequencing.2.3. Detection of target polypeptidesCells were grown overnight at 30°C in Luria–Bertani (LB) culture medium, and were inoculated in LB culture medium with ampicillin at OD600 = 2. After hours of constant shaking (OD600 = 0.6), L-arabinose (0.05%) was added to the culture medium to induce heterologous expression. Samples were collected at different time points and put on ice. When all samples were prepared, aliquots of the cells were observed through confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP8, Germany), and the rest were collected by centrifugation (4000×g, 20 min). The cells were then washed three times with cold PB (4000×g, 10 min), and cell lysis buffer [phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) 0.1 mM, PB 10 mM, lysozyme 1 mg/ml] was added to lyse the cells for 15 min before sonication (3 min). After ultrasonic breakage, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. EGFP in the supernatants was measured using fluorospectro-photometer (Hitachi F7000, EX WL: 460.0 nm) and was quantified using a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (CWBIO) before adding loading buffer and boiling for five minutes. Thirty micrograms of the protein extract samples were loaded on 12% stain-free SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), subjected to electrophoresis, and transferred to 0.2 µm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline buffer with Tween 20 (TBS/T) for 4 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (Abmart GFP-tag mAb, 1:1000) for 18 h at 4 °C. Next, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000, ZSGB-BIO) was applied for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the signals were visualized using an Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Roche).2.4. TAAI2.5. Bioinformatics data sourceThis work requires tRNA gene annotation information that is as accurate as possible; therefore, we compared annotation information from three databases. We chose three widely used databases: GenBank,28 a comprehensive bioinformatics database; the Genomic tRNA Database,12 which uses tRNAscan-SE;29 and tRNAdb,30 which contains more than 12,000 tRNA genes. A total of 410 genomes have the same tRNA gene annotation information in all three databases. If the tRNA gene annotations for one organism were consistent in the three databases, we deemed it as reliable and then employed this organism in further analysis. Nucleotide and protein sequences were downloaded from GenBank,28 and protein abundance values were acquired from PaxDb.31 We further compared the co-adaption of specific gene categories. Further analysis employed housekeeping genes (expression-invariable ones) and tissue-specific genes (expressed only in one tissue) from Ma et al.32 The young and old genes of human were acquired from Yin et al.33 and Wei et al.34 The horizontal transfer gene lists for bacteria were downloaded from HGT-DB.35We employed 53 organisms’ growth times (Supplementary Table S2). Here, we chose those archaea and bacteria with growth times from Rocha et al.36 Among 410 organisms filtered for reliable tRNA gene annotation, 376 archaea and bacteria were chosen to perform the analysis of correlation between TAAI and genome sizes. When comparing the TAAIs among proteins within a specific genome, we analyzed the protein abundances and TAAIs in six model organisms, which have integrated abundances in PaxDb.313. Results3.1. At the genome scale the tRNA and corresponding amino acid co-adapt to maximize the efficiencyDuring translation, tRNAs transport amino acids to ribosomes, and co-operation between the two components has been reported in a few organisms.37 Previous researches demonstrated that the tRNA gene copy numbers were different among organisms/strains/species, and that the protein sequences varied greatly.38 To check whether the amino acid usage of proteins generally co-adapts with the corresponding organism’s tRNA gene copy number, we calculated and compared independent frequencies of the two in 410 genomes from three domains of life (17 archaea; 359 bacteria; 34 eukaryotes), using more accurate tRNA gene annotations in GenBank,28 the Genomic tRNA database12 and tRNAdb.30 First, the frequencies of 20 standard tRNA genes (Supplementary Table S1) were computed by counting cognate tRNA gene copies and being divided by the organism’s total tRNA gene counts. Second, frequencies of the 20 amino acids in the proteome (Supplementary Table S1) were computed by dividing the count of each amino acid by the sum of the twenty amino acid counts. After obtaining these two types of data for each organism, we performed linear fit and correlation analyses.The linear fit results showed variable co-adaption relationships (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1), illustrating that the two factors (tRNA gene copy number and the amino acid frequency) are not independent from each other. Indeed, although the slopes of the fitted lines differed, in all cases, the tRNA gene copy numbers showed positive correlations with corresponding amino acid usages. Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r) were calculated after least square fitting (Supplementary Table S1). Specifically, 99.27% had correlation coefficients greater than 0.1 (Fig. 1B), and 75.61% showed significant correlations (P < 0.05). Finally, a general linear relationship exists between tRNA gene copy and amino acid usage. For four representative organisms, the archaebacterium Methanosphaera stadtmanae (r = 0.17, P = 0.46), the bacterium Escherichia coli (r = 0.54, P = 0.01), and the eukaryotes Saccharomyces cerevisiae (r = 0.74, P = 1.67e-04) and Homo sapiens (r = 0.56, P = 0.01), the linear models presented different co-adaption intensities (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S1). Compared with the other three organisms, yeast had the best linear fit. However, for M. stadtmanae, having the most unbalanced constitution of tRNA genes, the observed points were not well fitted. In general, most organisms’ tRNA gene copy numbers and amino acid usages showed a positive linear relationship. Co-adaption between frequencies of tRNA gene copy numbers and amino acid usage.

(B) Corresponding Spearman rank correlation coefficients r for the linear fit of 410 genomes. (C) Linear fit of four model organisms.We measured the co-adaption intensity using a tRNA gene copy and amino acid usage accordance index (TAAI), which equals to the r value of the Spearman rank correlation. During protein production, tRNA genes will be transcribed to tRNAs, and then loaded with amino acids for protein translation. Resource allocation would be the most efficient if the supply of tRNAs just meets the required amount of amino acids. Based on the results, our species/strain/organism scale reasoning was confirmed. In other words, most genomes had significant co-adaption between the tRNA gene copy number and the frequencies of amino acid usage and hence maximized their translation efficiency and minimized their energy/resource costs.Different genomes (species/strain/organism) may face different translation selection pressure when translating different numbers of proteins in a given time. For example, large genomes have more proteins, and fast-growing bacteria need to synthesize more proteins simultaneously. In fact, large bacterial genomes are often associated with short generation times.36 According to the maximum efficiency/minimum cost principle, fast-growing/large bacteria should have higher TAAIs than slow-growing and/or small bacteria. To test this possibility, we compared the TAAIs of 53 bacteria (Supplementary Table S2) and grouped them by growth time.36 The fast, had growth times below the mean of the 53 ones; the slow, had growth times greater than the average. The two groups had similar variances and GC contents, while the slow group had significantly lower TAAIs than the fast group (Fig. 2A). Thus, co-adaption showed an effect on growth rate. This result is consistent with the idea that population growth rate is a fundamental ecological and evolutionary characteristic of living organisms.39 Similarly, larger bacteria have larger genomes and more proteins that need to be translated than bacteria with smaller genomes.39,40 Therefore, we also compared the TAAIs of prokaryotic organisms grouped by genome size (small, medium and large). These three groups had significantly divergent mean TAAIs of 0.37, 0.60 and 0.65 (the Student’s t test: P < 2.2e-16; Fig. 2B). That the relatively larger genomes have higher TAAIs supports the conclusion that bacteria under higher selective pressure have higher TAAIs, thus conforming to our first hypothesis based on the principle of efficiency described above. Bacteria with smaller genomes and slow growing speeds would suffer less pressure from protein translations and hence have lower TAAIs. Co-adaption at the genome scale. (A) TAAIs of bacteria divided into two groups based on their growth rates. The dataset includes 53 bacteria with available information on growth rates: which were classed into two groups by the mean growth time. The fast group has higher TAAIs than the slow. The GC content of the two groups are similar (The students’ t test: P = 0.42), their genome sizes varied non-significantly (The fast generally has larger genome than the slow: P = 0.07). (B) Prokaryotic organisms’ TAAIs, associated with corresponding genome sizes. The prokaryotic organisms were divided into three groups, showing significantly different TAAIs. Here, 376 prokaryotic genomes were involved in the analysis of correlation between TAAIs and genome sizes. In addition, the GC content also affect the TAAIs along with the increase of genome sizes: GC small < GC median < GC large (P < 2.2e-16).Co-adaption at the genome scale.

In addition, the GC content also affect the TAAIs along with the increase of genome sizes: GC small < GC median < GC large (P < 2.2e-16).Some genomes have non-significant TAAIs and it would be beneficial to understand why. In prokaryotes, genome size and TAAI correlated well (r = 0.49, P < 2.2e-16) and almost all the 96 prokaryotes with bad TAAI/co-adaption do have genome sizes smaller than 2.5 Mb, whereas almost all genomes with good co-adaption are larger than 2.6 Mb. The weak TAAI of smaller genomes is obviously caused by their deficiency in request of translation efficiency: less selection pressure, which could be measured based on the genome size in these organisms. However, in eukaryotes, alternative splicing of messenger RNA results in an inconsistency between genome size and the number of proteins produced. Using the quotient of the number of proteins divided by genome size should be a more reliable reflection of eukaryotes’ actual translation demand (also selection pressure). Consequently, four eukaryotes, Bos taurus (cow), Felis catus (cat), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sea urchin) and Plasmodium falciparum with non-significant TAAIs indeed have smaller quotient. Therefore, it is reasonable that the lower translation demand (also selective pressure) leads some genomes to have bad TAAIs.3.2. Highly expressed proteins and those connected to acute response tend to have higher TAAI for fast productionThe aforementioned results validated the maximum efficiency principle at the genome (species/strain/organism) scale. Next, we asked whether there are co-adaption divergences within genomes and what such divergences may signify. The proteins within a genome also have different adaptions (variable TAAIs) for their different amino acid compositions (Fig. 3A). Taking H. sapiens as an example, a distinct difference was noted when comparing the co-adaption of the four proteins with the highest TAAIs and the ones of four proteins with the lowest TAAIs, which belong to a gene set with similar GC content and gene lengths (Fig. 3B). The amino acid frequencies of the top four were more consistent with the corresponding genomic tRNA gene copy frequencies. Within a given genome, this co-adaption divergence generally occurred among proteins. Intra-genome variation and translation factors. (A) TAAI distribution in three model organisms. (B) For human proteins having similar backgrounds (GC%: 0.64–0.66; lengths: 14,300–14,700 bp), they have variable intensities of co-adaption. Amino acid compositions of the top four proteins (Black ones) linearly correlated with the tRNA gene copy numbers, and Amino acid compositions of the bottom four (Red ones) do not change with the growth of the tRNA gene copy numbers, the gene names were listed in the subfigures. (C) Analysis of six model organisms’ abundance shows that highly expressed proteins generally have higher TAAIs than proteins with lower expression levels. Proteins in the high and the low groups have the similar GC content and lengths (The students’ t test: P > 0.05). Their GC contents are: A. thaliana 0.41–0.42; C. elegans 0.34–0.35; S. cerevisiae 0.39–0.41; E. coli 0.50–0.53; B. subtilis 0.50~0.53; H. sapiens 0.5–0.53. We try to determine the most appropriate GC contents under which more proteins can be included into the analysis. (D) The housekeeping genes and old genes have higher TAAIs than those tissue specific and young genes. These results accord with the results by Ma et al. and Yin et al. that housekeeping and old genes suffered more translation selection.Intra-genome variation and translation factors.

(D) The housekeeping genes and old genes have higher TAAIs than those tissue specific and young genes. These results accord with the results by Ma et al. and Yin et al. that housekeeping and old genes suffered more translation selection.Selective pressure within genomes is reflected by the direct results of translation efficiency: proteins’ abundances, even though the two values are not entirely equivalent. Co-adaption should reflect the supply of aminoacyl-tRNA, which ultimately affects the final protein synthesis. We compared six model organisms’ TAAIs and found that proteins with higher expression levels had clearly higher TAAIs than proteins with lower expression levels by Student's t test, even these proteins are with similar GC content and gene lengths (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, when using a linear fit, the TAAIs and the protein abundances showed significantly positive correlations (P < 1e-6; Supplementary Table S3). This result is consistent with the idea that tRNA level has direct effects on translation efficiency.41 Thus, as a reflection of the translation rate, protein abundances correlate with TAAIs to a certain extent, and their relationship seems to be a consequence of selection pressure to keep a suitable translation rate.To further explore this finding, and considering that paralogous genes in the same family have similar molecular evolutionary stresses and changes,42 we compared the TAAIs in E. coli and yeast according to gene function groups: ribosome subunits, cell division,43 two-component system (including response regulators and sensors,44 mismatch repair45 and sugar metabolism.46 The average TAAIs and protein abundances for five groups of genes were calculated (Table 1). For the E. coli and yeast genomes, proteins from all these groups had average TAAIs higher than the genome average (Student’s t test: P = 3.54e-12). Three of the five groups correspond to acute responses (cell division, two-component system, and mismatch repair), and the other two groups are related to fast growth (ribosome subunits and sugar metabolism). Ribosome subunits are important participants in the translation process, and there is no doubt that ribosome subunits have the highest abundance, TAAI and codon usage bias index CAI.4 Sugar metabolism proteins, which includes proteins in ‘Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism’, also has higher TAAI and abundance than genome average. Although the abundances of proteins in the other three categories are lower than genome average, their TAAIs were higher. We further compared the protein abundance and TAAIs of experimentally determined upregulated yeast genes,47 and observed similar results (Supplementary Table S4). Thus, proteins involved in acute responses under more selective pressure, generally have good co-adaption relationships. Analysis of the potentially rapidly expressed proteins according to their functions in E. coli and S. cerevisiaeProteins in bold face had lower corresponding values than genome’s average values.Analysis of the potentially rapidly expressed proteins according to their functions in E. coli and S. cerevisiaeProteins in bold face had lower corresponding values than genome’s average values.According to Yin et al.33 and Ma et al.,32 old genes and housekeeping experience stronger translational selection. Thus, the co-adaption in these genes should be better. We employed the gene lists from this two papers and arrived at the expectant conclusion (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table S5). Additionally, those horizontally transferred genes experiencing less translation selection also have bad co-adaptions (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, our second reasoning was also validated: at the scale of individual proteins, co-adaption intensity may vary among the protein collective within a genome. Some proteins need to be expressed rapidly to maintain their quantity to be connected with an acute response.3.3. Experimentally optimizing co-adaption indeed lift the protein expressionAccording to the principle and the results above, co-adaption was associated with the translation rate, prompting us to examine whether the proteins with high TAAIs indeed have high translation rates in vivo. To test this conjecture, one copy of a specific tRNA gene that might increase or decrease the TAAI was introduced to E. coli along with a gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) after which EGFP protein synthesis was analyzed.Proteins with higher TAAIs might have higher translation rates, and thus higher production levels. EGFP is easy to express and detect, and constructs for tRNA overexpression have previously been designed and tested.48 Therefore, by combining the expression of EGFP with a tRNA gene, we can detect the effect of a specific tRNA on EGFP expression. Increasing the copy number of the corresponding tRNA gene may increase or decrease the TAAI for EGFP and the whole genome (Fig. 4A). EGFP had a TAAI of 0.45 when expressed with the original frequencies of E. coli tRNA genes. When one gene copy encoding either tRNAGUCAsp<U+2060>, tRNAGATIle or tRNAGTATyr was introduced, the corresponding <U+0394>TAAIs for EGFP were 0.03, 0.0008 or -0.007, respectively, and the cumulative <U+0394>TAAIs for all proteins of the genome were -28.68, -43.77 or 78.68, respectively. The following sequences were constructed in plasmids: EGFP (control group), tRNAGUCAsp-EGFP (tRNA-Asp), tRNAGATIle-EGFP (tRNA-Ile) and tRNAGTATyr-EGFP (tRNA-Tyr), which were used to transfer E. coli Top10 cells (Fig. 4B). In E. coli, there is only one type of tRNA (isoacceptor tRNA) for Asp, Tyr and Ile, which means that codon bias has no observable effect on the increase in EGFP expression. We observed fluorescence intensity with confocal microscopy and found that the EGFP yield of the experimental group expressing tRNAGUCAsp-EGFP was significantly higher than the others at the same time point (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Detailed fluorescence intensities of the four groups acquired with a fluorospectro photometer (Fig. 4C), showed that the EGFP production efficiency of the four groups from low to high was as follows: Control, tRNA-Ile, tRNA-Tyr and tRNA-Asp. The fluorescence intensities were consistent with western blotting results (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S2B). The experimental group tRNA-Asp produced ten times more EGFP than the Control. Considering the dynamic processes involved in EGFP abundance variation, the slope of tRNAGUCAsp-EGFP abundance was much higher than that of the control, indicating that the translation rate of the former was higher.

The corresponding electrophoretogram, shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B, reflects the loading volume of the total proteins.To further rule out the possibility of codon usage influence, we compared the number and coding order of codons for the three tRNAs in EGFP (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The EGFP mRNA sequence has one type of Ile codon (ATC), two types of Tyr codons (TAT: 9%, TAC: 91%), and two Asp codons (GAT: 11%; GAC: 89%). All preferred codons are the corresponding codons for the E. coli cognate tRNAs. Therefore, there should be no significant variant effect of varying from the preferred codon. Then, we calculated the dispersion degree by analysis of variance, as the order of tRNA can influence its recycling during translation.14 We analyzed the variance of amino acid sites both locally and globally. The variance of the first eleven sites for Ile, Tyr and Asp are: 53, 61 and 46. The corresponding recycling effects should be weakened when increasing specific tRNA gene copy numbers. In fact, increasing the Ile tRNA gene copy number does not significantly increase EGFP production. Together, the results do not indicate an influence of tRNA recycling or preferred codon usage. This experiment confirmed that co-adaption has a clear effect on translation rate. Thus, optimizing co-adaption could significantly promote translation production of foreign proteins.4. Discussion4.1. This co-adaption relationship benefits translation rate differently from codon usageCells are believed to evolve to maximize efficiency and minimize resource and energy cost.49,50 We hypothesized that this principle would affect translation mechanisms, and we tested this conjecture based on the basic translation ‘tool’ tRNAs and the ‘raw material’ amino acids. To maximally utilize the resources, we reasoned that the quantities of the 20 tRNAs and amino acids in a species should be consistent based on this principle. For simple and convenient analysis, we used the tRNA gene copy number as the proxy for the former, and used the amino acid frequency as the latter. The genome has an average vector of amino acid frequency and each protein also has its vector form of amino acid frequency. Hence, there would be a general co-adaption value for each genome and a specific co-adaption value for each protein. Using correlation and abundance (functional group) analyses we validated our two conjectures, which are logical outcomes of the maximum efficiency and minimum cost principle. Based on the results and analyses, the genome’s TAAI could be regarded as a proxy for general translation efficiency or actual translation needs. Proteins’ TAAIs reflect the highest translation efficiency or translation need in extreme conditions.Co-adaption is a global effect exerted on proteins and organisms. Each organism has a specific amino acid usage and a co-adapted tRNA gene copy number. This co-adaption maximizes the translation efficiency of the complete proteomes. The larger translation pressure the organism is exposed to, the higher average TAAI it has. In a genome, almost all the proteins have positive TAAI values (Fig. 3A). Hence, this co-adaption as a translation rate associated factor is applicable to all three domains of life and all proteins within an organism. However, facing multi rate-limiting factors, it is uncertain how much of the final translation rate can be determined by the TAAI.The fact that codons affect the expression is well-known.1,2,8,51,52 Then we wonder whether the adaption of codon usage to isoacceptor tRNA gene copy number resulted in co-adaption between amino acid composition and tRNA gene copy number. We computed the correlation index according to codon usage of multi-organisms from three domains and multi-genes, and detected very weak adaption for codon usage to important translation rate-limiting factor tRNA copy number (Supplementary Table S6, Supplementary Fig. S1B, S3A, S3B). On the contrary of codon effects, the amino acid compositions should suffer the translation selection independently.However, more and more researchers found that amino acid composition is under more translation selection than codon usage. Li et al. firstly reported that the codons decoded by rare transfer RNAs did not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions.17 Then, Subramaniam et al. showed that protein synthesis rates were highly similar across yellow fluorescent protein variants during amino acid-rich growth, while some synonymous codons were highly sensitive to environmental perturbation during limitation for corresponding amino acids.53 Zhou et al.54 lately reported that impacts of codon usage are mainly due to their effects on transcription and largely independent of translation. Williford and Demuth compared several expression related factors and introduced that highly expressed genes have stronger selection for amino acid composition than codon usage.55 It is proved that the cost minimization principle causes the amino acid relative abundances to connect with metabolic cost.56 In contrast to the consistency between the local effects of synonymous codon usage and tRNA gene copy number on translation rates,17,52 the TAAI is a translation rate associated factors with universal and global effects.4.2. Energy efficiency and selective pressure for co-adaptionCo-adaption arises from energy efficiency and selective pressure. Organisms evolve to maximize efficiency and minimize energy cost by adapting through genetic mechanisms.40,49 Such global co-adaption might raise the translation efficiency globally, coinciding with the energy efficiency/ecological dynamics principle.50 Previously, Higgs and Ran analyzed 80 bacterial genomes and found that tRNA gene copy numbers evolved in response to translational selection.57 It is notable that they observed consistency between synonymous codon usage and tRNA gene copy number and that the unequal usage of synonymous codons encoding the same amino acid was involved. However, our current study on co-adaption focuses on disequilibrium frequencies among the twenty standard amino acids. Here, the co-adaption reflects a balance between tRNA gene copy number and the amino acids needed by the proteome. Redundant excessive tRNA gene copies will ultimately be a waste of translation resources (<U+2060>tRNAGATIle did not increase the EGFP production in E. coli). Selective pressure drives the co-adaption at the protein level. Experiments showed that increasing the TAAI could indeed improve the translation speed of the proteins and hence validate that the co-adaption is caused directly by translation pressure. These results indicate that translation selection causes co-variation at the scale of organisms and individual proteins.If we expand our view to the domains of life, which have evolutionary connections58,59, such selection also exists. We found that eukaryotic genomes had much better adaption values than the other two domains (Fig. 5). The translation rate for eukaryotic genomes is ~3–8 amino acids per second,60 compared to 10–20 amino acids per second for bacterial genomes.61 In contrast, eukaryotes have much larger genomes and, hence, many more proteins. Thus, eukaryotic proteins would undergo stricter translation selective pressure. This higher pressure may be one of the reasons for the higher co-adaption observed in eukaryotes. Focusing on the bacterial domain, we observed that larger bacterial genomes tended to have higher TAAIs, and the TAAI value correlated positively with the genome size. Higher selective pressure may be the reason for this positive correlation. Taking all of the results into account, co-adaption is one effect of translation selection at all three levels (domain, genome and protein) and the selection complies with the maximum efficiency and minimum cost principle. Comparison of the co-adaption (TAAI) of three domains. The medians for Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya were 0.37, 0.61 and 0.69. Archaea had relatively low TAAIs, and Eukarya had the highest. Analysis of variance revealed that the three domains were significantly different, with a P value close to zero (P = 2.57e-06).Comparison of the co-adaption (TAAI) of three domains.

Analysis of variance revealed that the three domains were significantly different, with a P value close to zero (P = 2.57e-06).4.3. Potential application in lifting translation rate and hence protein productionThis co-adaption can be applied to enhance translation efficiency in practice. Traditionally, in industrial application, the yield of a specific protein is improved by optimizing its synonymous codon usage.62 A higher ratio of optimal codons could facilitate the transcription efficiency by frequent usage of abundant or efficient tRNAs.14 Here, the yield of EGFP was improved markedly in E. coli by optimizing TAAI through increasing the gene copy number of specific tRNAs, thus increasing the translation speed at least tenfold. This finding may be applied in industrial production. To obtain higher output of one protein, we could optimize its co-adaption between tRNA gene copy number and amino acid usage by adding specific tRNA gene copies. Thus, the protein’s translation could be accelerated quickly. One of the prominent advantages of such an operation is that the yields of multiple proteins could be improved in one round. The production of multiple proteins could be increased by adding specific tRNA gene copies corresponding to their amino acid usage. This ideal result is based on the supposition that adding a specific tRNA gene could increase the TAAIs of many proteins simultaneously. A more practical method would be to divide all target proteins into groups based on similar amino acid frequencies. If the tRNA genes to import are carefully chosen, the target group of proteins will have higher expression levels but the other proteins should remain almost unchanged.In the field of synthetic biology, it is hoped to devise and construct a general bacterial chassis cell that integrates functional synthetic parts, devices and systems. In practice, such a chassis has often been constructed or synthesized based on small and slowly growing bacteria.63,64 However, slow growth may limit their capacity to produce enough target molecules in a short time. Our strategy of importing certain tRNA genes may help to address this problem when designing chassis cells.We thank Mr. Lu-Wen Ning for suggestions, Juan Feng’s lab and Lixia Tang’s lab for providing help with experimental materials and methods, and our lab members for fruitful discussion.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31501063) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (ZYGX2016J117, ZYGX2015J144).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionUstilago esculenta is a basidiomycete fungus, which infects ancient wild rice, Zizania latifolia.1,Zizania latifolia belongs to the tribe Oryzeae within the Gramineae2 and was one of the six most important cereal crops in ancient China.3 After infection with U. esculenta around 2000 yrs ago,4,Z. latifolia formed a shuttle-like gall and was gradually domesticated as an aquatic vegetable called Jiaobai in East and Southeast Asia5 particularly in China, which has antioxidant properties and may prevent hypertension, cardiovascular disease.6 Similar to other crops domestication, Jiaobai plants were artificially selected to increase their suitability to human requirements: taste, yield, storage and cultivation practices. In some unfavourable conditions, like high-dose radiation, water deficiency, unsuitable application of fungicide or unfavourable growing temperature, or if the plants were abandoned, the plants may produce galls being full of dark teliospores (called grey Jiaobai) or escape from fungal infection (called male Jiaobai).7,8 It was the long-term artificial selection that effectively maximized the occurrence of favourable Jiaobai and enabled U. esculenta consecutively to be maintained in host plants. Since U. esculenta was the cause of the vegetable, the process of crop domestication actually was the process of artificially selection on interaction complex of fungus and host. A key question, then, is to understand how domestication has shaped U. esculenta from the plant pathogen to entophyte and how, in turn, these changes may influence the interaction between the fungus and the host.It has been shown that host domestication has driven the emergence of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae9 and the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici.10 In contrast to natural evolution, domestication is due to humans as selective agents; but, just like natural selection, domestication fully depends on genetic variation, mutations, inheritance and demography.11 The emerging consensus is that domestication causes a distinct imprint on genomes.12 Integrated and fully analyses of the genome will give insight into the underlying effect of domestication. The comparative genomic study on Mycosphaerella graminicola and its wild sister species showed that speciation of M. graminicola was associated with adaptation to domesticated wheat and its associated agro-ecosystem.13 And indeed, comparative genomics has revealed underlying mechanisms of genome evolution, for example, transposon-mediated gene loss driven the rapid evolution of M. oryzae,14,15 and gene loss rather than gene gain resulted in the host jump in the smut fungus Melanopsichium pennsylvanicum.16Smut fungi are biotrophic pathogens causing characteristic sympotoms, the replacement of plant organs by black masses of teliospores, in a number of agriculturally important crop plants, mostly grass family (Grmineae). These basidiomycete fungi belong to the order Ustilaginales containing over 50 genera. Several different smut diseases in cereal crops are mostly caused not only by species of the genus Ustilago but also by other genera such as Sporisorium.17,Ustilago esculenta together with Ustilago maydis, Ustilago hordei and Sporisorium reilianum are belonging to Ustilaginaceae family but owning some distinct characteristics. For instance, U. esculenta spend its entire life cycle in the host plant (Fig. 1),3,18 while most smut fungi infect and colonize the plant with the dikaryotic mycelium and are released from the host after spore formation. There has been found that the phytopathogenic fungi developed many infection mechanisms to be successfully colonized, including surface sensors like Sho1 and Msb2,19 intracellular signalling cascades like Cyclic Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),20 secreted proteins to penetrate host plant and establish biotrophy21 and transcription factors acting as key regulators of differentiation.22 Besides, for dimorphic fungi, mating reaction and filament formation are essentials of the morphogenetic switch, which should be prepared already before penetration. Although for U. esculenta, there might be some special characters considering its unique entophytic lifecycle evolving from a pathogen. In addition, U. esculenta inhibits host inflorescence formation and cause stem enlargement, and Z. latifolia is its only known host1 until now. Although many smut fungi are known to be non-host and -tissue specificity. For example, U. maydis cause symptom at any aboveground parts of host plant, which is coupled to secreted protein effectors23 and their organ-specific expression.24,25,Ustilago hordei and S. reilianum cause the grain, inflorescence develop into smut sori, respectively.25 Covered smut of barley and oats is caused by U. hordei, and head smut caused by S. reilianum is found in both maize and sorghum. Differentiated effectors being targeting different host molecules were responsible for varied infecting strategy of U. maydis and S. reilianum even they parasitized the same host.26 And a larger repeat content at important loci, including mating-type and effector loci, were identified for U. hordei to explain varied genome evolution on its host when comparing with U. maydis and S. reilianum.26Life cycle of U. esculenta in Z. latifolia.

Ustilago esculenta, which evolved as the result of crop domestication from plant pathogen to entophyte, offers the possibility to address several major questions in plant pathogen evolution. These include what general changes can be observed in genomes after a long-term domestication? To what extent are pathogenicity and the associated effectors affected by the crop domestication? What helps the smut fungi to sustain the suitable growth condition in the host with delayed teliospores formation? To address these questions, we determine the genome sequence of U. esculenta, highlight genomic comparison among U. esculenta, U. maydis, U. hordei and S. reilianum and perform transcriptome analysis to characterize the different stages of the U. esculenta life cycle in association with phenotype of host plant.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and growth conditionsUstilago esculenta strain was isolated from edible Jiaobai of Longjiao No 2 in 2011 in Zhejiang province of China. Longjiao No 2 is one of the most widely cultivated Jiaobai varieties in east China. The galls were harvested at 160 days after planting. The U. esculenta strain was isolated from non-sporulating gall by slice separation method and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. After 6–10 days, the white mycelia that grew out from the tissue were transferred to potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium. The mycelia (M) for further analysis were collected after shaking in PDB medium for 3 days at 28°C. Teliospores were isolated from sporulating gall of grey Jiaobai and old gall of edible Jiaobai and cultured on PDA medium. After 3–5 days, haploid strains were obtained by single sporidia selection with capillary pipet under microscopy and transferred to PDB medium for additional 3 days shake-culture at 28°C. Enriched sporidia were collected for further analysis. Haploid strains from edible Jiaobai called MT strain with deposited number CGMCC Nos. 11841 and11842 in China Center for Type Culture Collection, haploid strains from grey Jiaobai called T strain with deposited number CGMCC Nos. 11843 and11844.2.2. Mating assayTwo haploid strains with heterogametic types from U. esculenta were streak cultured on YEPS solid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% sucrose and 1.5% agar) separately, at 28°C. After 3 days, single colonies were picked into YEPS medium for further culture (28°C and 180 r.p.m). The sporidia cells were collected when OD600 reached 1 and re-suspended to OD600 of 1.5. The two cultures were mixed 1:1 Vol/Vol and spotted onto YEPS solid medium and cultured at 28°C. Microscopic observation and PCR confirmation of the mating loci were performed 4 days after incubation.2.3. Effect of amino acids on mating and hyphal growthMating assays were carried out and the mixed culture of two mating strains were spotted onto the basic medium (K2HPO4 1 g/l, MgSO4·7H2O 0.5 g/l, FeSO4·7H2O 0.01 g/l, KCl 0.5 g/l, glucose and agar 15 g/l) supplement with different amino acids (arginine, histidine, isoluceine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine or valine) as nitrogen source (20 mM) or as trace elements (0.2 mM) when KNO3 as nitrogen source (20 mM/l). With an interval 12 h, mating colonies were mounted for microscopy and after 3 days, hyphal length were measured.2.4. Effect of arginine on strain T and MT hyphal growthTwo haploid T strains and MT strains with heterogametic types were cultured and mixed as described in ‘Mating assay’ in method. The 3 µl 1:1 Vol/Vol mixed cultures were inoculated on YEPS solid medium and Arg medium (K2HPO4 1 g/l, MgSO4·7H2O 0.5 g/l, FeSO4·7H2O 0.01 g/l, KCl 0.5 g/l, Sucrose 68 g/l and arginine 13.9 g/l) individually. The cultures were incubated at 28°C. With an interval 12 h, hyphal length was measured. The measurement was repeated for three times.2.5. DNA, RNA preparation, genome sequencing and assemblyMycelia (M), sporidia from grey Jiaobai (T) and from edible Jiaobai (MT) were used to isolate DNA and RNA. All the materials were washed with sterile water for three times and centrifuged. After grounding in liquid nitrogen, genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method18 and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). The isolated RNA was then treated by RNAse-Free DNase and then subsequently treated using Illumina mRNA-Seq Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Four DNA sequencing libraries with different insert lengths (170 bp, 500 bp, 6 Kb and 10 Kb) and 7.7 Gb raw sequence data (Supplementary Table S1) were generated using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (BGI, Shenzhen, China).After removing low quality and adapter sequences, the reads were de novo assembled using the CLC workbench 5.5.1 (CLC bio). SSPACE BASIC (version 2.0)27 was used for scaffold construction and GapFiller (version 1.10)28 was applied for gap closure.Genome heterozygosity was first analysed by K-mer analysis and then confirmed by alignment between assembled scaffolds and original reads. Genome Analysis TK (Version 1.6) was used to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).Genome sequences of U. maydis were downloaded from the Broad institute of Harvard and MIT (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/ustilago_maydis/ (6 July 2017, date last accessed)). Sporisorium reilianum and U. hordei genomic sequences were downloaded and retrieved from the Munich information center for protein sequences (ftp://ftpmips.gsf.de/fungi/Sporisorium_reilianum/ and ftp://ftpmips.gsf.de/fungi/MUHDB/).2.6. Repeat annotationA de novo repeat database of U. esculenta was generated using RepeatModeler (Version 1.0.7, http://www.repeatmasker.org/ (6 July 2017, date last accessed)). RepeatMasker (Version 3.2.7, http://www.repeatmasker.org/ (6 July 2017, date last accessed)) was used to identify repeats from our de novo database and Repbase database (http://www.girinst.org/ (6 July 2017, date last accessed)). LTR_FINDER (version 1.0.5)29 was applied to identify the long terminal repeat (LTR) elements.2.7. Gene annotationWe predicted genes as follows: (i) de novo prediction. Genes were predicted using Augustus (Version 2.03)30 with training gene sets from the U. maydis genome. (ii) Homologue-based prediction. We mapped the protein sequences of U. maydis, S. reilianum and U. hordei to the U. esculenta genome using tBLASTn, with a cut-off E-value of 10-5. (iii) RNA-seq based prediction. All contigs from RNA-seq were mapped to the U. esculenta genome by TopHat (Version 2.0, http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/). (iv) All the gene predictions were combined using GLEAN (version 1.0.1)31 to produce consensus gene sets.Gene functions were assigned according to the best match of the alignments using BLASTp (E-value < 10-5)32 searching against the nucleotide database of NCBI. The motifs and domains of genes were determined by InterproScan (Version 4.5)33 against UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein database. All genes were classified according to Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Release 48.2) pathways. If the best hit of the genes in any of these processes was ‘function unknown’, the second best hit was used to assign the function until there were no more hits that met the alignment criteria, then this gene is determined as functionally unknown. OrthoMCL (version 2.0.9)34 was used to group U. esculenta genes into orthologue clusters.Genes were also analysed for carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes, http://www.cazy.org (6 July 2017, date last accessed)) using dbCAN.35 Genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were analysed using the JVI Secondary Metabolite Unique Regions Finder Web server.36 SignalP (version 3.0)37 was used for the prediction of secreted proteins. The candidates were analysed with ProtComp 6.0 (http://www.softberry.com (6 July 2017, date last accessed)) and TargetP (version 1.1)38 were used to predict protein localization. Information regarding the effects of virulence was retrieved from PHI-base (http://www.phi-base.org/ (6 July 2017, date last accessed)).The tRNA genes were identified by tRNAScan-SE (version 1.21).39 For rRNAs identification, the rRNAs from U. maydis were aligned against the U. esculenta genome using BLASTn (E-value < 10-5) to identify possible rRNAs. Other non-coding RNAs, including miRNA and snRNA, were identified using INFERNAL (version 1.1)40 by searching against the Rfam database.41Genome syntenic analysis of smut fungi were performed with MUMmer (version 3.0),42 the schematic representation of the genome synteny was generated with CIRCOS (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/).2.8. Transcriptome sequencing and analysisMycelia (M) and sporidia (MT) of MT strain and sporidia (T) of T strain were collected for transcriptome sequencing. Three samples of same culture were collected for sequencing company to guarantee the quality of RNA extracting and sequencing. The transcriptomes were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The reads from different sequenced samples (M, T and MT) were mapped to the whole-genome assembly using SOAP2.43 The expression quantification was calculated based on RPKM measurement.44 Only if the gene’s expression profile differs between two samples with a fold change > 2 and a P-value < 0.01 by edgeR,45 with estimateDispersions method as ‘blind’, this gene was considered to be significantly differentially expressed. The transcriptomic data have been deposited at GenBank under accession SRR1611140, SRR5234219 and SRR5234220 for M, T and MT, respectively. To understand the effect of long-term interaction between the host plant and U. esculenta, the transcriptomic data of stems from edible Jiaobai with U. esculenta in the plant and wild Z. latifolia (GenBank accession number, PRJNA187578)46 were downloaded and used.2.9. Phylogenetic analysisThe phylogenetic relationships of U. esculenta, U. maydis, U. hordei, S. reilianum and Cryptococcus neoformans were constructed using 45 single copy gene families (Supplementary File S3) by OrthoMCL. The alignments were performed using Clustal omega (version 1.2.0)47 with default parameters. One hundred bootstrap replicates were generated for each gene family alignment using the Seqboot package in PHYLIP (version 3.69, http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/). For each replicate, a maximum likelyhood phylogenetic tree was constructed using Promlk package of PHYLIP under Joes–Taylor–Thornton model with testing of a molecular clock. The consensus tree was built based on 4,500 trees from the bootstrap experiments by the Consense package in PHYLIP with an extended majority rule. The percentage of support by the 4,500 individual trees was indicated on each branch of the consensus tree.3. Results/discussion3.1. Sequencing of the U. esculenta genomeThe collected mycelia of U. esculenta were sequenced using Illumina Higseq2000 platform. Four different insert libraries (170 bp–10 kb) were sequenced to generate a total of 4.54 Mb trimmed data with a genome coverage of ×139 (Supplementary Table S1). The reads were de novo assembled into 1,869 contigs with a total size of 20.2 Mb (Table 1). Since the strain was diploid, we checked the heterozygosity by k-mer (Fig. 2) and SNP analysis (Supplementary File S1). Although some random sequencing errors exist, only one distribution was found by K-mers with volume peak at 85, indicating the high homozygosity of genome. To confirm the result, we aligned the assembled scaffolds with original reads. Totally, 2,118 SNPs including 228 homologous SNPs were found. Such a low SNP frequency and density further validated the genome homozygosity. The N50 lengths of contigs and scaffolds of the assembly were 101.8 and 404.8 kb, respectively. The assembled draft genome size of U. esculenta is moderately larger than U. maydis and S. reilianum but slightly smaller than U. hordei. In total, 6,654 candidates gene were identified based on homology to known proteins and the transcriptomic data (detailed annotations see Supplementary File S2), indicating that U. esculenta has similar proportion of protein-coding regions as the other three smut fungi. The proportion of genes encoding secreted proteins was around 10% (663 out of 6,654 genes) of the annotated genes. This whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession JTLW00000000. The version described in this article is version JTLW01000000. The genome statistics of U. esculenta compared with other sequenced smut fungiThe genome statistics of U. esculenta compared with other sequenced smut fungiThe volume of K-mers is plotted against the frequency at which they occur. The left, truncated peak at low frequency and high volume represents K-mers containing essentially random sequencing errors, whereas the right distribution represents proper (putatively error-free) data. The total K-mer number is 2,424,289,422 and the volume peak is 85. The genome size can be estimated as (total K-mer number)/(volume peak), which is 28.5 Mb.The volume of K-mers is plotted against the frequency at which they occur.

Higher intron number and varied genome defence were found in U. esculentaWe performed comparative genomic analysis on the four Ustilaginales, U. maydis, U. hordei, S. reilianum and U. esculenta. Ustilago esculenta shares a high degree of genomic synteny with U. hordei, U. maydis and S. reilianum (Fig. 3). Orthologue comparison of U. esculenta, U. maydis, U. hordei and S. reilianum identified 3,602 genes clusters that were common to all four species (Fig. 4). Ustilago esculenta had the highest orthologue similarity to U. hordei (88.6%, 4,166 out of 4,699). It shared 87.2% (4,102 out of 4,699) and 82.1% (3,860 out of 4,699) gene orthologue similarity with U. maydis and S. reilianum, respectively. The results are consistent with the phylogenetic analysis, which showed that U. esculenta is more closely related to U. hordei than to U. maydis and S. reilianum (Fig. 5). Specific U. esculenta gene cluster (number: 399) with classifications (number: 103) were enriched in genes associated with secreted proteins (number: 62).

Consensus phylogenetic tree was constructed from 4,500 trees (45 gene family × 100 bootstrap replicates). Trees were mid-point rooted. The numbers on the branches indicate the percentage of the 4,500 trees support the consensus tree. The fungus A.

Consensus phylogenetic tree was constructed from 4,500 trees (45 gene family × 100 bootstrap replicates). Trees were mid-point rooted. The numbers on the branches indicate the percentage of the 4,500 trees support the consensus tree. The fungus A. Nidulans is used as an out group.Unconserved regions still existed in the U. esculenta genome (white regions in the red Ue genome in Fig. 3). The length of these non-syntenic regions was 3.1 Mb, 15.1% of the whole genome. GC content of these regions was 55.63%, a little higher than that of syntenic regions (51.3%). Totally, 1,589 candidate genes were predicted on these regions (Supplementary File S5), which were spreading in 59 pieces (each piece containing at least 4 genes). Based on the synteny analysis of orthologous genes, 243 genes were found to be orphan genes, and 761 out of 1,346 orthologous genes were annotated as hypothetical protein or uncharacterized protein. No enriched function was found according to GO analysis.These four smut fungi have similar genome sizes, GC content and gene-coding percentages. The most obvious differences between our sequenced genome and the other three Ustilaginales are the number and average length of introns and exons. Ustilago esculenta has ~2,000 more exons and introns individually compared with the other three genomes. This results in higher ratio of exons or introns to genes in U. esculenta. The number of intron-free genes is the lowest and the number of introns per gene (0.84 intron per gene) is the highest in U. esculenta among all four genomes. However in comparison to Aspergillus nidulans (2–3 introns per gene) or C. neoformans (5 introns per gene), U. esculenta has fewer introns. Similar to other Ustilaginales, introns of U. esculenta were primarily distributed at the 5'-end of genes, likely due to the selective pressure during evolution.5 The number of introns may also be determined by the rates of evolution. Roy and Gilbert48 suggest that a large number of introns are often found in relatively earlier ancestors based on maximum likelihood reconstructions. Slow-evolving species may retain more introns than the fast-evolving species. This may explain the higher intron numbers in U. esculenta compared with other three Ustilaginales. Farmers keep selecting on the Ustilago–Zizania interaction complex every planting season to retain the vegetables that maintain the desired morphology of the variety. Only a few plants with the potential to produce high quality Jiaobai are kept for propagation. The artificial selection may reduce the selective pressure from nature, and consequently, slow down the evolution rate and result in higher intron numbers in U. esculenta.Analysis for repeating sequences showed that the repeated sequences did not cluster in a specific region but were randomly distributed across the draft genome of U. esculenta. The coverage of repeats (7%) and transposable elements (TEs) in the assembled contigs are similar to that in U. hordei (7.8%).25 It is nearly 3 and 10 times higher than in U. maydis and S. reilianum, respectively. Surprisingly, the coverage of unclassified repeats in the U. esculenta assembled scaffolds (2.9%) was 10 times higher than that reported in U. hordei (0.23%).25 TEs expansion in fungi may increase the size of the genomes but it could also help the species adapt to a new or challenging environment.49 However, two-thirds of the U. esculenta TEs have no known functions. The U. esculenta TEs showed low similarity with their counterparts found in U. hordei.Unlike U. hordei, we did not find a repeat-induced point (RIP) mutation mechanism in U. esculenta. The RIP mutation is a fungal-specific genome defence that repetitive elements mutated from CpN to TpN (GpN to ApN).50 RIP may be a limiting factor for TEs replication51 and it can control TEs activity. Ustilago maydis lacks genes responsible for RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. Similar to U. hordei and S. reilianum, genes related with RNAi mechanism were annotated in U. esculenta. Those included one sequence of Ago1 (g3793), one sequence encoding Dcl1 (g4220) and three sequences encoding RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRP1, g3276; RdRP2, g1610 and RdRP3, g4076). Chromodomain-coding HP1-like (Chp1, g238) and C5-cytosine methyltransferase (DNAme, g3112) that were detected in U. hordei and S. reilianum were found in U. esculenta as well. Ustilago esculenta showed highly conserved synteny with S. reilianum and U. hordei in Dcl1, DNAme and RdRP3. Only U. hordei carried additional genes with functions associated with retrotransposition in the Chp1 (UHOR_15241) and RdRP1 (UHOR_13400, UHOR_08875 and UHOR_13402). The RdRP1 locus of U. esculenta showed a distinct pattern compared with U. hordei and S. reilianum. There was one gene missing (homologue of UHOR_05573) in U. esculenta. It indicates that these four smut fungi have evolved differently regarding genome defence when they were under different selection pressure. The possession of RNAi-related genes and the lack of RIP may suggest that U. esculenta utilizes RNAi for genome defence to control TE proliferating and activity under high selection pressure. Although U. hordei balanced TE activity by combination of RNAi, methylation and RIP mutagenesis,49,U. maydis may maintain genome stability through highly efficient recombination system for lack of universal mechanisms for TE control and heterochromatin formation.49 Genome defence mechanism of S. reilianum, an intermediate between U. hordei and U. maydis, remains to be determined although silencing pathway components being represented in its genome.3.3. DEGs between different strainsTo further determine changes of gene expression between different life stages and different strains, digital gene expression profiling of M, T and MT were investigated (Supplementary File S2 and Table S2). Totally, 6,344, 6,307 and 6,335 genes were expressed at M, T and MT, respectively, and 97.7% (6,250 out of 6,394) were constitutively expressed, while only 52 genes were strain-specific and 92 genes were expressed at two strains (Fig. 6). Four hundred and seventy-seven differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (P-value < 0.01 and fold change of expression > 2.0) between mycelia and sporidia or between sporidia of T strain and MT strain were identified (Supplementary File S2). Clusters of expressed genes in M, MT and T strains. A expressed gene number was listed for each components and strains.Clusters of expressed genes in M, MT and T strains. A expressed gene number was listed for each components and strains.GO term enrichment analysis of the 477 DEGs indicated that the DEGs correlated with transport (transmembrane transport and transporter activity), localization, oxidation reduction, oxidoreductase activity, ion binding, cation binding, cofactor binding, co-enzyme binding, membrane and so on were enriched. Interestingly, when compared with sporidial cells, most of DEGs (394 out of 441) were up-regulated in mycelia cells. And similar pattern was observed for sporidia of T strain when compared with that of MT strain (Supplementary Table S3), indicating a more active status of T strain cells.3.4. Structure and function of mating-type lociGenes that have a strong effect on speciation are those involved in mating, hyphal fusion or dikaryon formation, and those associated with ecological adaptation.15 The a mating locus comprises a pheromone-receptor system, which is conserved in the sequenced smuts.52Ustilago maydis and S. reilianum have tetrapolar mating systems and their mating loci a and b locate in two different chromosomes. Whereas the mating loci a and b in U. hordei are in the same choromosome (bipolar).A gene cluster of a2-locus is found in U. esculenta on Scaffold 34 containing the left border gene lba (g4094), one mating pheromone gene mfa2.1 (g4096), the right border gene rba (g4097) and the panC (g4098) by bioinformatic analysis. Also the gene cluster of a3-locus is found on Scaffold 161, containing one mating pheromone gene mfa3.2 (g6433) and one pheromone receptor gene pra3 (g6434). Comparing to other smut fungi, the a locus should have at least two genes, pheromone gene and pheromone receptor gene. So we did the homologous comparison to the sequence from lba gene to rba gene on Scaffold 34, finding the pheromone receptor gene pra2, another mating pheromone gene mfa2.3 and the mitochondrial protein gene rga2 in the a2-locus, which was confirmed by PCR with the primers designed from lba and rba. Same works have been done in the a3-locus. However, the right border gene could not be found and, instead, a long sequence mainly encoding transposase were found at the end of the Scaffold 161. Additional PCR were carried out with the primers designed from lba, rba and the intermediates, and another mating pheromone gene mfa3.1 was found nearby the rba gene. The two a loci of U. esculenta were syntenic to that of S. reilianum, respectively, with conserved gene content, order and position, except for two remarkable characters (Fig. 7).

(B) Indicates the loci b structures which include the two homeodomain proteins bE and bW.First, a3 locus was distinctively enlarged in U. esculenta. The a2 locus encompassed 10-kb regions, while a3 locus extended to over 22-kb, with a transposase flanking to panC and a ~14-kb segment inserted between pra3 and mfa3.1 (Fig. 7). A comprehensive search of a3 locus for repetitive elements identified seven LTR (two Gypsy, three Copia and two DIRS) occupied 31.6% of this large region. And 76.9% of LTR located at a 14-kb insertion region. This was similar to MAT-1 of U. hordei, which accumulated repetitive elements (many were LTR) covering more than 50% of this region.25 TEs, having been proved to be implicated in the mating-type rearrangement in basidiomycete53,54 and yeast,55 are associated with steps in the evolution of sexual types.49 Selection pressure from the co-evolving hosts makes Ustilago and other obligate parasites continue adaptation and favour the presence of higher frequencies of TEs,49,56 which may explain the extended segment of mating locus in U. esculenta and U. hordei. Recent research found that Gypsy-like elements were related to ovule development in sexual but not apomictic (asexual) genotypes of plants57 and transposons drove sex chromosome evolution with the evidences from Drosophila Miranda.58 Therefore, the high frequency of TEs in mating locimay help U. esculenta to maintain adaptive potential with regulation of the mating-type rearrangement and the sexual reproduction stage but more in-depth analysis is needed.Second, the gene lga2, which ensuring uniparental mitochondrial DNA inheritance59 and being major component interfering with pathogenic,60 is missing from a2 locus and also is not present in the genome. Uniparental inheritance of mitochondria dominates among sexual eukaryotes and is influenced by the mating-type loci in many species, such as slime mold Physarum polycephalum, basidiomycete fungus C. neoformans and U. maydis, green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.61 The lga2 and rga2 genes are specific to the a2 mating-type locus and direct uniparental mtDNA inheriance by mediating elimination of the a1-associated mtDNA in U. maydis. Lga2 has a negative role on mitochondrial fusion and may functions on mtDNA elimination, whereas Rga2 can counteract the mtDNA elimination from Lga2-dependent.59 Besides rga2, important genes involved in mitochondria inheritance were found in U. esculenta, for example, dnm1 (g6223, a central component of mitochondrial fission), fis1 (g2409, involved in mitochondrial fission), fzo1 (g3102, key component of mitochondrial fusion) and mrb1 (g5377, mitochondrial p32 family protein). It was implied that U. esculenta might mediate its mitochondrial genome integrity and inheritance in a differentiated way compared with wild U. maydis strain, but a similar way to lga2 deletion strain, which leads to biparental inheritance. This may be benefit the fungi to maintain its entophytic life during artificial selection, for biparental inheritance, coupled with mitochondrial recombination, has been speculated to be a potentially adaptive strategy under challenging environmental situations.62In addition to the a locus, Ustilaginales have the b locus encoding two transcription factors that can form an active heterodimer, if they come from compatible mating partners. Scaffold 22 contained a cluster of the b mating-type genes bE2 (g2853) and bW2 (g2854), which were significantly up-regulated in sporidia. In S. reilianum, bW is separated from the neighbouring gene nat1 by a transposon. Similarly a transposon-related sequence was also found between bE and c1d1 in U. esculenta. As for the a locus, a second copy of the b locus was present in the mycelial culture containing bE3 and bW3. The main target of bW/bE is the transcription factor rbf1,63 which also has an orthologue in U. esculenta. To test if mating and filament induction occurs, we generated haploid sporidial cultures from U. esculenta teliospores. Mixing of two sporidial cultures led to induction of filaments showed compatible mating types recognized each other (Supplementary Fig. S1). This indicated that the genetic program for mating and induction of filaments was maintained in U. esculenta.In our genome assembly, the a and b mating-type genes were present in different scaffolds (Scaffolds 34 and 22). Without further experiments, it is difficult to conclude if U. esculenta has a bipolar or tetrapolar mating system. However, we found the left border gene lba existed in a2 and a3 loci and c1d1 gene in b2 locus, indicating the complete border genes existed in a and b loci in U. esculenta, similar to that of S. reilianum. Besides, two pheromone genes were detected in both a2 and a3 locus, indicating additional a locus existed to provide pheromone receptor to sense the pheromone (mfa3.1 and mfa2.1). So there should be three a loci in U. esculenta, although the third one were not found in our genome draft. Base on the mating loci comparison, we assume that the mating system of U. esculenta is more similar to S. reilianum than U. hordei.Recognition of the opposite mating partner leads to activation intracellular signal transduction network of a MAPK module and cAMP signalling pathway. Both have been shown to influence mating and later stages of the pathogenic development.64,65 Most genes reported to be involved in meiosis, MAPK and cAMP signalling cascades in pathogenic Ustilaginales were found in the U. esculenta genome. We also found orthologues of the transcription factors prf166 and clp1,67 which are required for cell fusion, filamentous growth and pathogenic development. The genes involved in the signalling network of U. maydis (Fig. 8) were also found in U. esculenta except sho1. All of these genes expressed and up-regulated expression were only detected for in strain M. Networks of signalling and transcription factors regulate the pheromone response. Key components of cAMP-mediated Protein Kinase A (PKA) signalling are heterotrimeric G protein a subunit Gpa3, b subunit Bpp1, adenylate cyclase Uac1 and regulatory and catalytic PKA subunits Ubc1 and Adr1, respectively.64 Lipopeptide pheromone activates its cognate seven-transmembrane domain receptor (Pra). The activated receptor triggers a signalling pathway containing the scaffold protein Ubc2 and a pheromone responsive MAPK module (MAPKKK Kpp4, MAPKK Fuz7 and MAPK Kpp2).67 The MAPK regulates Prf1 via phosphorylation and at the transcriptional level. At least four different transcription factors, Rop1, Crk1, Hap2 and Prf1, recognize defined cis-active elements in the prf1 promoter (RRS1-3: Rop1-responsive sequence; CCAAT: CAT box; PREs: pheromone response elements; UAS: upstream activating sequence; bent arrow: transcriptional start site). In addition, MAPK activity is counteracted by phosphatase Rok1, which is activated at the transcriptional level by the MAPK module, resulting in negative feedback regulation. Prf1 leads to expression of the b-mating type locus gene bE and bW. After cell fusion, sexual and pathogenic development is orchestrated by the bE/bW-heterodimer, coordinating the key players of important developmental steps: Clp1 is required for in planta proliferation; Rbf1 is the central transcriptional regulator, controlling appressoria formation and penetration of the host plant via the transcription factor Biz1 and the MAPK Kpp6, as well as filamentous growth and the G2 cell cycle arrest by concerted action of Biz1 and Hdp1.62Networks of signalling and transcription factors regulate the pheromone response.

And in sporidial cells (both in T and MT) the pheromone-receptor system mfa2.3, pra2 was higher expressed, while it was expressed lower in mycelia (M). Higher expression of the pheromone-receptor system in sporidial cells would be consistent with capacity of sporidial cells to mate resulting in mycelial growth.3.5. Distinct amino acids responding mechanism on balancing interaction between U. esculenta and Z. latifoliaNutrition is essential prerequisite for the onset and manifestation of an infection by pathogenic microorganisms, and the plant pathogenic fungi usually delayed to digest host cells to obtain a range of nutrients.68 Biotrophic fungi, including U. maydis, appear to absorb the nutrients available in the apoplast surrounding living host cells for much of its pathogenic growth phase, which helped to avoid plant defence systems throughout the infection process.69 It makes the fungi have to maintain sets of genes encoding biosynthetic and degradative enzymes for primary metabolism. To fully understand relationship between U. esculenta and its host, we checked the genes involved in central metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, ß-oxidation, glyoxylate cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and <U+03B3>-aminobutyricacid (GABA) shunt (Supplementary File S6). Nearly all enzymes can find orthologues in U. esculenta; however, ilvC (important for all branched amino acids) and certain genes for biosynthesis of tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, alanine and serine were missing in U. esculenta (Fig. 9). Ustilago maydis also lacks a couple of these genes but contains ilvC. Since U. esculenta was an entophyte, we checked the candidate genes of amino acid biosynthesis and its expression in the host plant, by RNA-seq analysis of stem tissues from edible Jiaobai and wild Z. latifolia (which had no U. esculenta inside). Remarkably, all the missing genes of amino acid biosynthesis in U. esculenta were found in Z. latifolia and most of them showed a higher expression level in edible Jiaobai (Fig. 9). This kind of cooperation was also found in symbiotic system of aphid host and its symbiont70; and in aphid, host gene expression and symbiont capabilities are closely integrated within bacteriocytes, whose function as specialized organs of amino acid production. Here, we deduced that U. esculenta is a strict biotrophic fungus, and a partial complementary mechanism had formed after 1000 yrs of symbiosis. However unlike insects and their symbionts, it was the host plant providing the intermediate amino acid production. Amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway in U. esculenta. Based on the amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway in plants and fungi, the putative amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway map of U. esculenta was drawn. Sets of genes encoding biosynthetic and degradative enzymes, which showed differences in the genome of U. maydis, U. esculenta and Z. latifolia, were marked in blue box. Therein, the red genes ID in the box filled with yellow indicated the genes cannot find in U. esculenta, the red genes ID in the box with white bottom colour showed the genes only can find in Z. latifolia, while the green genes ID indicated the genes cannot find in U. maydis. All the genes marked with * means the up-regulated expression during stem swollen progress based on transcriptome sequencing data basic analysis.Amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway in U. esculenta.

All the genes marked with * means the up-regulated expression during stem swollen progress based on transcriptome sequencing data basic analysis.The amino acid effect on mating and in vitro mycelium growth of U. esculenta and U. maydis are very attracting. We found when using arginine as main nitrogen source, it inhibited the fusion of yeast cells (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S2), which was contrary to the promoting effects on mycelia formation in Ceratocystis ulmi71 and Candida albicans.72 The arginine biosynthesis pathway was up-regulated in yeast/mycelia switching,72 which was the most essential response in the progression of infection. In U. esculenta, the presence of exogenous arginine may exhibit feedback inhibition on arginine biosynthesis.73 The host plant may conveniently employ this feedback mechanism to modulate U. esculenta infection. It was consistent with the results of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) detection for amino acids content in stems of grey Jiaobai and edible Jiaobai, that free arginine content is significantly higher in Jiaobai with disease symptom (grey Jiaobai) than in the edible Jiaobai (Supplementary Table S4). But more studies need to be done to show how the arginine regulated the dimorphism and what signalled the regulation-feedback system. Comparision of the mating response to the macro- or micro-amino acids effect in vitro between U. esculenta and U. maydisAll the hyphae length data were detected 3 days after mating assays of U. esculenta and U. maydis on basic solid medium with different kind and amount amino acid added. The capital letter as a superscript showed significant differences analysis between edible and grey jiaobai at P < 0.05 level, analysed by one-way ANOVA analysis with Duncan method. All the amino acids (AA) name were abbreviation listed in the table. Also, integrated mating ability analysed of the hyphae length and amount (Supplementary Fig. S3) were estimated. Therein, ‘-’ means no hyphae formation; ‘+’ means less hyphae or short hyphae length; ‘ ++’ means normal hyphae amount and length and ‘ +++’ means large amount hyphae and long hyphae length.Comparision of the mating response to the macro- or micro-amino acids effect in vitro between U. esculenta and U. maydisAll the hyphae length data were detected 3 days after mating assays of U. esculenta and U. maydis on basic solid medium with different kind and amount amino acid added.

Therein, ‘-’ means no hyphae formation; ‘+’ means less hyphae or short hyphae length; ‘ ++’ means normal hyphae amount and length and ‘ +++’ means large amount hyphae and long hyphae length.Also, results of mating assays indicated some distinct regulation mechanism of amino acids in U. esculenta. First, in mating progress, U. esculenta may reduce dependence on branched chain amino acids, which were defective in U. esculenta (Fig. 9, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S2 and File S7). For adding leucine, isoleucine or valine could promote mycelia formation in U. maydis but had little effect on U. esculenta (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S2). Second, U. esculenta may adapt to proline, methionine, lysine, phenylalanine and their metabolism, which were closely related to plant disease resistance reaction.74–80 In U. maydis, adding each of the four amino acids inhibited the mating progress, which related to fungal pathogenicity, but in U. esculenta, they had conspicuous promotion effect on mycelia formation (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S2). Besides, histidine, the reactive oxygen species scavenger,81 can also promote the yeast cells fusion in U. esculenta.Overall, we speculated that U. esculenta developed a partial complementary mechanism to gain the host’s nutrition while the hosts also utilize some nutrition metabolism pathways to defence infection. In addition, in vitro assays showed that His, Pro, Met, Lys and Phe, which host plant biosynthesized to respond fungus infection, were utilized by U. esculenta to promote its mating progress which was important for its successful infection, indicating that U. esculenta may change some amino acids response mechanism to regulate the balance of infection–resistance engineering for adapting the entophytic life, during 1000 yrs in Z. latifolia.3.6. Fewer surface sensors and CSEPs benefit economic entophytic life of U. esculentaThe basic requirement for pathogens to infect host is to perceive physical and chemical stimuli when contacting with host surface and then induce to penetrate host either by high turgor pressure, like M. oryzae and Colletotrichum spp.,82,83 or by secretion of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), like U. maydis and Cochliobolus carbonum.84,85 During the process, surface sensors, secreted proteins, CAZys and CWDEs are the indispensable factors.Sho1 and Msb2 are conserved upstream proteins of MAP kinase cascade not only in the phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum, M. oryzae and U. maydis but also in model fungus S. cerevisiae, and human fungal pathogen C. albicans, having been approved to recognize the surface signals, direct the central transcriptional network towards penetration.22 It is intriguing that there is no Sho1 orthologue in U. esculenta. We further investigated 61 genes (42 of which are secreted proteins) related with Sho1/Msb2 and also involved in filament and appressoria formation.22 Forty-two orthologues were found in U. esculenta, and more than 50% of them up-regulated in mycelium when compared with sporidial. Nineteen (17 of which are secreted protein genes) out of 61 genes were not found in U. esculenta (Supplementary File S8), including some important virulence factors, for example pit2 (protease inhibitor in conjunction with Pit1 to maintain biotrophy during plant infection), am1 (appressoria marker gene), mig2-5, mig2-6, dkh6 (a 7TM protein, which might function in plant/pathogen interaction).86The whole mig2 gene cluster, a maize-specifically expressed cluster, is missing in U. esculenta. The Ustilago scitaminea, pathogen of sugar cane, appears to lack the mig2 cluster too.87 And interestingly, some U. maydis strains isolated from South America lost the mig2-4 and were unable to trigger disease symptoms in regional maize variety.87 The mig2 cluster was related with host range,88 which may partially explain why U. esculenta cannot infect maize and has a narrow host range. Lanver et al.22 identified 139 plant surface cue-induced secreted proteins in U. maydis. Ustilago esculenta shares 112 these genes including 31 CWDEs and majority of b-induced genes (Supplementary File S9), loses 27 important secreted protein such as exg1,89,egl1 (cellulase gene expressed only in the filament),90,hum2 (the former hydrophobin gene in aerial hyphae formation)91 and tin2 (promotes virulence by targeting anthocyanin biosynthesis).92Fungi produce a variety of CAZys to facilitate infection and/or gain nutrition. A total of 237 genes including auxiliary activities, glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases (CEs) and glycosyl transferases as well as carbohydrate-binding modules were identified in U. esculenta (Fig. 10). Those genes belonging to the fungal CAZy families are presumably involved in nutritional uptake and infection mechanisms. The U. esculenta genome contains 55 genes (including 9 CEs and 46 GHs) involved in plant cell wall-degradation, which was similar to U. maydis,93,U. hordei25 and S. reilianum,26 but much fewer than hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi such as M. oryzae94 and Botrytis cinerea.95 The compositions of CEs and GHs are similar between the four Ustilagonales species. There is also no significant change in the total number or composition of enzymes coding for the digestion of the three major plant cell wall polysaccharides classes: cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin (Supplementary File S10).

Totally, 633 proteins were identified as secreted proteins. Of these secreted proteins, 300 were predicted to be candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) since they could not be assigned to enzymatic functions. Compared with U. maydis and U. hordei, the genome of U. esculenta has nearly 20% more predicted secreted proteins and a 10~20% fewer predicted CSEPs (554 secreted proteins and 386 CSEPs for U. maydis. 515 secreted proteins and 333 CSEPs for U. hordei).25 Ninety-two (15%) of 633 U. esculenta secreted proteins were species specific. Among them, 87 were CSEPs which were 29.6% of total predicted CSEPs. Four hundred and fifteen of 633 (66%) U. esculenta secreted proteins are shared among U. maydis, U. hordei and S. reilianum (Supplementary Table S5). Of them, 97 secreted proteins could be matched in pathogen–host interaction database (PHI-database)96 with an amino acid identity >30%. Of all PHI hits, 55 out of total proteins were characterized as increased or reduced virulence. The remaining hits were either characterized as unaffected virulence or loss of pathogenicity.There were 57 (11%) secreted proteins assigned to 14 clusters in U. esculenta, in comparison to 21, 7 and 22 clusters in U. maydis, in U. hordei and in S. reilianum. Seventy-six percent of Ue genes in clusters had orthologue Um genes, with amino acid identities ranging from 23.3 to 94.2%. Among the 14 clusters identified in this study, seven clusters were previously described Um effector gene clusters (Supplementary File S2), including all clusters whose deletion reduced virulence or non-pathogenic. Fungal secreted proteins are assumed to contribute to tumour formation,90 and organ-specific effectors in both host and pathogen are required for host tumour formations.24 In U. esculenta, the homologues with um3615 and um3616 secreted proteins were found, which were important genes of cluster 9A for tumour symptoms in adult tissue. When considering the responsible gene cluster 19A for tumour formation in U. maydis seedlings, only 4 out of 15 homologues of cluster 19A were present in U. esculenta. It may be the reason that U. esculenta could not trigger gall formation during seedlings. And more attention should be paid to find stem-specific gene clusters.Besides, when we compared 92 CSEPs being important for successfully colonization of grass hosts and a core set of 248 CSEPs needed for pathogenicity (PSEPs) which were concluded from genome comparison among smut fungi M. pennsylvanicum, U. maydis, U. hordei and S. reilianum,16 55 grass host-related CSEPs and 182 PSEPs can find orthologues in U. esculenta (Supplementary Files S11 and S12). But it is remarkable that some important host-related CSEPs, including um03223 (maize-induced gene mig1), um12216 (related to Mig1 proteins) and 9 Ustilago-specific proteins, were not found in U. esculenta (Supplementary File S11). Furthermore, nearly 95% of U. esculenta-specific secreted proteins were CSEPs, which was one-third of total CSEPs. Missing of host-related CSEPs can further confirmed the narrow host range of U. esculenta, and species-specific CSEPs may give more hints in explanation. It has been proposed that effector genes, as speciation genes in fungal plant pathogens,97 co-evolve with their host targets and reflect the host adaptation.98All in all, although the U. esculenta shared core set of secreted proteins with some smut fungi indicating the close relation, the fungus has evolved distinguish characters of fewer surface sensors, high percentage of species-specific CSEPs and fewer CSEPs, lost some important virulence factors and host range-related effectors. All these characters may be the nature need of maintaining lower cost endophytic life and limitation of small genome size, which was the obliged evolution under long time pressure on keeping the mycelia phase and making no need to re-infect the host.The authors thank Ying Rong for the preparation of the fungus collection, Cao Qianchao for mating assay, Gui Yijie for analysing assistant with host gene expression, Michael Feldbrügge for providing plasmids.

Out of the six, three proteins were originated from a single candidate sequence, AR19M-311. An amino acid sequence comparison suggested the amino acid residues that appeared to be crucial for thermal stability of the enzymes.1. Introductionß-Xylosidases, which cleave the ß-1,4-linkage of xylan from the non-reducing terminus to release d-xylose, have received attention in the past decade with respect to biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass due to their potential to degrade hemicellulose, the second most abundant lignocellulose biomass, coordinately with endoxylanases and some glycosidases, such as arabionosidases and gluclonidases.1 Although the sequences of over 800 ß-xylosidases have been registered in the enzyme database BRENDA,2 there is interest in the identification of thermostable ß-xylosidases, because enzymatic processing at high temperatures prevents contamination with saprophytic bacteria and lowers the viscosity of the reaction mixture, thus increasing the high reaction efficiency and reducing energy consumption during agitation of the mixture.3 Thermostable ß-xylosidases have been isolated from thermophilic micro-organisms from hot compost material and hot spring soils. The thermophilic bacteria Thermotoga maritima and T. thermarum produce ß-xylosidases active at temperatures above 90 °C.4,5 Thermostable ß-xylosidases from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii and Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus have also been reported.6,7 A thermostable ß-xylosidase exhibiting an optimum reaction temperature of 85 °C was isolated from the archea Sulfolobus solfataricus.8 A ß-xylosidase isolated from the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans was reported to be active at 80 °C.9 No amino acid sequence motifs clearly associated with the thermal stability of these thermostable enzymes have been identified, however. The characterization of additional thermostable ß-xylosidases will hopefully enhance our understanding of the molecular features associated with thermal stability, which in turn could facilitate genetic engineering of hydrolytic enzymes suitable for industrial use.Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now enable researchers to more easily access the vast stores of DNA sequence data for mixed micro-organisms, known as the metagenome. As such, the use of metagenomic approaches to identify enzymes of interest has increased in recent years in many areas of biological research.10 Although ß-xylosidases have been isolated from sources of mixed DNA (such as compost or yak rumen microbes, for example) using traditional screening of genomic libraries,11,12 no attempts have been made, to our knowledge, to isolate thermostable ß-xylosidases using an NGS-based metagenomic approach.In this study, we employed NGS to obtain an 84.2-Gbp sequence from a microbial community inhabiting a 70 °C hot spring. The sequence contained 168 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding ß-xylosidase/ß-glucosidase enzymes, most of which were active when expressed in Escherichia coli. Among the isolated enzymes, six ß-xylosidases, including ones originated from clones with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were highly thermostable, exhibiting activity at 90 °C. Interestingly, one protein, AR19M-311-27, lost activity at 90 °C, while three other homologous proteins were active at 90 °C. Based on these data, amino acid residues important for maintaining thermal stability were tentatively identified.2. Materials and methods2.1. Metagenomic DNA extraction and sequencingThe soil sample was collected by scratching the surface of a spout of a hot spring (70 °C and pH 7.2 when sampled) by a spatula in the Onikobe-onsen-kyo geothermal area at lat. 38°48’ and at long. 140°40’ (Miyagi, Japan) in June, 2009. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from microbes in 10 g of the soil using an ISOIL Large for Beads, ver. 2, DNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Five micrograms of the extracted DNA were sequenced using a GS FLX Titanium DNA sequencer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the supplier’s protocol. In addition, the genomic DNA was amplified using a GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and then sequenced using a Hiseq 2000 DNA sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the supplier’s protocol. Sequences with a total length of 1.11 Gbp and average length of 396 bp for each read were obtained from the former sequence, and sequences with a total length of 83.1 Gbp and average length of 92.7 bp for each read were obtained from the latter sequence. Uncertain sequences were trimmed from the raw sequences based on the quality score defined, and the resulting sequences were used for de novo assembly using CLC Genomics Workbench software, ver. 4.0.2.2. Prediction of the genes encoding ß-xylosidasesGenes and their ORFs in the assembled contigs were extracted using MetaGeneAnnotator software,13 with the multiple species option for metagenome analysis, as recommended by the software supplier. The homology to ß-xylosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.37) and ß-glucosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.21) amino acid sequences of the extracted ORFs were searched using BLAST (Supplementary Table S1) with sequences downloaded from the UniProt database, release date November 2011 (http://www.uniprot.org). The list contained 2,140 amino acid sequences, although the latest release (2017_06) contain 13,585 sequences for the enzymes, which could be useful for future research. ORFs exhibiting homology to the amino acid sequences of ß-glucosidases/ß-xylosidases with an expected value <1 × 10-20 were categorized as glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family members, with the hydrolase motifs defined in the Pfam database, version 23.0 (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk), using HMMER software, version 2.3 (hmmer.org).2.3. Cloning of the predicted genesPredicted gene sequences were amplified from the metagenomic DNA using KOD-FX DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with PCR primers shown in Supplementary Table S2. The PCR-amplified fragments with four additional bases (CACC) at the 5’-terminus for directional TOPO® cloning were then inserted into the pET101/D-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and introduced into E. coli TOP10, which was a host for the vector recommended by the supplier for efficient cloning. The recombinant plasmids were extracted from the E. coli culture using a Wizard plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). The inserted sequences of the plasmids were analysed on an ABI 3730 DNA analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientific).2.4. Preparation of cell-free extractsTo produce the proteins, the plasmids isolated from E. coli TOP10 were introduced into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which is designed to efficiently express foreign DNA. The E. coli colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin and cultivated until the optical density at 600 nm reached approximately 0.2 to 0.8. Isopropyl-ß-d(-)-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to the culture to induce expression of the foreign DNA encoded by the vector, and cultivation was continued for 16 h. The cells were harvested from the cultures by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8). The cell suspensions were homogenized using an Astrason 3000 homogenizer (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and filtered using a 0.45-µm pore-size filter to prepare cell-free extracts used for the initial assay shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.To assess the thermal stability of the all ß-xylosidases, recombinant E. coli cells were inoculated into 1 ml of Overnight ExpressTM instant LB medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 50 µg/ml of carbenicillin and cultivated for 20 h at 30 °C with rotary shaking at 1,000 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 10 min, washed twice with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and lysed by freeze-thaw cycling in 200 µl of the buffer. The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris and used for the assay.In the assay for determining the optimal reaction temperature and pH and thermal stability of the proteins originated from AR19M-311, recombinant E. coli cells were inoculated into 100 ml of Overnight ExpressTM instant LB medium containing 50 µg/ml of carbenicillin and cultivated for 20 h at 30 °C with rotary shaking at 180 rpm. The cells were then washed twice with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), homogenized using a Sonifier 250 homogenizer (Branson Ultrasonics, St. Louis, MO, USA), and heat-treated at 70 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatants were subjected to the ß-xylosidase activity assay.2.5. Enzyme purification by column chromatographyThe cell-free extract was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography using an ÄKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) system equipped a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer. The active fractions were collected and applied onto a HiTrap Phenyl HP column (GE Healthcare) for hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The enzyme was finally desalted by gel permeation chromatography using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare).2.6. Enzymatic activity assayHydrolysis of p-nitrophenylxylopyranoside (pNPX) by cell-free extracts containing the recombinant proteins was evaluated by determining p-nitrophenol release by measuring the absorbance at 400 nm. The portion (50 µl) of cell-free extracts were mixed with 1.7 mM of pNPX in 200 µl of 50 mM acetate or sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5 or 6.8) and incubated for 20 min. After the reaction, the same volume of 200 mM Na2CO3 was added to the reaction mixture, and the absorbance at 400 nm was determined.Thermal stability was evaluated at 50°C and 90 °C in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). pNPX was used as the substrate to assay ß-xylosidase activity in crude cell-free extract. Before the assay, the cell lysates were incubated at 50°C or 90°C for 15 min. The assay was performed by adding 50 µl of the cell lysates to 200 µl of buffer containing 1.0 mM pNPX at 50°C for 15 min. Following addition of the same volume of 200 mM Na2CO3, the release of p-nitrophenol was measured by determining the absorbance at 400 nm. Instead of the cell lysate, water was added to the reaction mixture for the blank assay. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme releasing 1 µmol of p-nitrophenol per minute.The optimal reaction temperature (50° C to 90° C) and pH (2 to 10) of the proteins originated from AR19M-311 were assayed in 50 mM GTA buffer, which consisted of 50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid, 50 mM 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, and 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. After the reaction, the amount of p-nitrophenol released was monitored using the same method described above. For assays of the thermal stability of the proteins originated from AR19M-311, the enzymes were incubated at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 90° C for 0 to 60 min in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). After incubation, the residual activity was measured at 90°C for 15 min using pNPX as the substrate.Concentrations of proteins were determined by Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.2.7. Phylogenetic analysisThe amino acid sequences of known ß-xylosidases were obtained from either UniProt database entries assigned as ß-xylosidases or the BRENDA database containing thermostable ß-xylosidases, and the sequences were then reviewed. These sequences and that of AR19M-311 were aligned using ClustalX ver. 2.014 with default parameters; subsequently, the phylogenetic tree was generated. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using FigTree ver. 1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).3. Results3.1. Sequencing the metagenomic DNA of a hot spring microbial communityMetagenomic DNA was extracted from a microbial community isolated from the soil of a hot spring (70 °C, pH 7.2) in Miyagi, Japan, and then subjected to NGS using a GS FLX Titanium DNA sequencer. The average length of the reads produced from each DNA fragment was 396 bp. The assembled sequences, totaling 1.1 Gbp, were searched against a list of amino acid sequences of ß-xylosidases/ß-glucosidases downloaded from the UniProt database (Materials and methods), resulting in the identification of 54 ORF sequences homologous to ß-xylosidases/ß-glucosidases. To find more genes, we then sequenced a portion of the DNA amplified from the metagenomic DNA using a Hiseq 2000 DNA sequencer, which has a higher sequencing output than the former sequencer. The resulting sequences (83.1 Gbp) were assembled with the previously generated 1.1 Gbp sequence. A total of 967,925 contigs with a length >500 bp were finally obtained, of which the longest contig was 287,641 bp.3.2. Isolation of a gene encoding a thermostable ß-xylosidaseFrom the assembled sequences, 168 genes potentially belonging to GH families 1, 3, 31, and 43 were obtained from ORF prediction using MetaGeneAnnotator, followed by homology searching of the ORFs using the programs BLAST and HAMMER. A total of 105 ORFs appeared to be full-length, and the remainder lacked 5’- and/or 3’-terminal sequences. The ORFs exhibited a wide distribution of amino acid sequence similarity with known sequences of ß-xylosidases and ß-glucosidases in the UniProt database, as shown in Fig. 1. Most of the ORFs exhibited <80% homology with known sequences, indicating that metagenomic approaches are useful for identifying novel sequences. Frequency distribution of the 168 ORFs identified by identity searches against known ß-xylosidases/ß-glucosidases contained in the UniProt database.Frequency distribution of the 168 ORFs identified by identity searches against known ß-xylosidases/ß-glucosidases contained in the UniProt database.Using PCR, we amplified DNAs corresponding to ORFs, and cloned the resulting products into the pET101/D-TOPO vector using E. coli TOP10 as a cloning host. The CACC sequence, necessary for TOPO® cloning, was added on the 5’-terminal of the forward primer. Each of the DNA primer set was designed to amplify the region from initial codon to terminal codon of each full-length ORF. However, when amplifying the ORFs lacking 5’- and/or 3’-terminal sequences, the DNA primer sets were designed to amplify the region of the longest in-frame sequences of the ORFs, and added lacking initial and/or terminal codons at the terminals. One to six independent clones for each ORF were isolated to confirm DNA insertion by partial sequencing. In total, 269 genes originating from 120 ORFs were successfully cloned. These 269 genes were consisted of the ones that were identical to the original ORF sequence and the others that possessed SNPs. Then we distinguished all of the genes by adding branch numbers. The host of the plasmids was then changed from E. coli TOP10 to E. coli BL21 Star (DE3), which was more suitable for protein production. Cell-free lysates of the new host were used for evaluating ß-xylosidase activity using pNPX as the substrate (Supplementary Table S2). When assayed at 50 °C, 82 crude cell-free extracts showed activity against the substrate (Fig. 2A). However, only six extracts retained the activity when assayed at 90 °C, indicating that most of the enzymes were not thermostable at higher temperatures (Fig. 2B). The highly thermostable enzymes included three proteins originated from AR19M-311 (AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M-311-21), each single protein originated from AR19M-319 (AR19M-319-21), AR19M-329 (AR19M-329-1), and AR19M-333 (AR19M-333-4). AR19M-311-27 originated from AR19M-311 was lost its activity at 90°C, while three other proteins were highly thermostable. Then, we further investigated the enzyme characteristics of proteins originated from AR19M-311 to reveal the relationship between thermostability and SNPs. The amount of p-nitrophenol released from the hydrolysis of pNPX by the crude cell-free extracts with the 82 ß-xylosidases isolated from the metagenomic DNA. The enzymes were incubated at 50 °C (A) or 90 °C (B) for 15 min, then subjected to the ß-xylosidase assay using pNPX as the substrate. After the reaction, the amount of p-nitrophenol was measured to detect the residual activity.The amount of p-nitrophenol released from the hydrolysis of pNPX by the crude cell-free extracts with the 82 ß-xylosidases isolated from the metagenomic DNA.

After the reaction, the amount of p-nitrophenol was measured to detect the residual activity.3.3. Effects of temperature and pH on the hydrolysis of pNPX by the ß-xylosidasesWe characterized the proteins originated from AR19M-311 further after removal of host-derived proteins by heat treatment at 70 °C, which caused most proteins in the lysate, except the heat-stable enzymes, to precipitate. A protein, AR19M-311-27, lost activity during incubation at 70 °C. AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M-311-21 showed similar optimum temperatures (Fig. 3A). These enzymes showed an optimal pH of 5.0, but no activity was detected at pH 4.5 when assayed at 90 °C, whereas AR19M-311-27 showed negligible activity at all pH values examined (Fig. 3B). The drastic difference in activity over such a narrow pH range (5.0 to 4.5) suggests that there are structural differences between the pH range, and this will be an interesting target of research when the three-dimensional structures of the enzymes become available. Similar pH dependency was reported for a ß-xylosidase from Enterobacter sp.15Optimal ß-xylosidase activity reaction temperature (A) and pH (B) for the proteins originated from AR19M-311. ß-Xylosidase activity was assayed at several temperatures in GTA buffer (pH 5.0) in (A) and in buffers adjusted to different pH values at 90 °C in (B). Activity was assessed by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm.Optimal ß-xylosidase activity reaction temperature (A) and pH (B) for the proteins originated from AR19M-311. ß-Xylosidase activity was assayed at several temperatures in GTA buffer (pH 5.0) in (A) and in buffers adjusted to different pH values at 90 °C in (B). Activity was assessed by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm.As the three enzymes AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11 and AR19M-311-21 showed almost the same optimum pH and temperature for the enzymatic reaction (Fig. 3), only AR19M-311-2 was further purified by column chromatography using HiTrap Q HP and HiTrap Phenyl HP columns to determine the kinetic parameters under the optimal reaction conditions using pNPX as the substrate. The kcat of AR19M-311-2 was 1.30 × 102 s-1, and the Km for pNPX was 0.872 mM. The lineweaver-Burk plot for the determination of the kinetic parameters was shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.3.4. Thermostability of the ß-xylosidasesWe analysed the thermal stability of AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M-311-21 by incubating the partially purified enzymes without substrate at 50°C, 60°C, 70°C, 80°C, and 90 °C and pH 5.0 for 0 to 60 min (Fig. 4). The enzymes retained above 80% of their initial activities at 50°C, 60°C, and 70°C for more than 60 min, except AR19M-311-2 whose activity was decreased to 50% after incubation at 70°C for 60 min. The three enzymes lost 50% of their activities within 10 min at 80°C. While the activity was immediately lost when the substrate pNPX was absent at 90°C, the hydrolysis proceeded at 90°C at least 15 min as shown in Fig. 3 when the substrate existed. Hence, it suggests that the substrate stabilize these enzymes. When the crude cell-free extracts were used, the activities were retained after incubation at 90°C without the substrate as shown in Fig. 2, indicating the enzymes were stabilized in the extract.

The enzymes were preincubated at 70°C for 10 min to precipitate host-derived proteins, subsequently, the enzymes were incubated at 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 °C for 0 to 60 min and then subjected to the ß-xylosidase assay using pNPX as the substrate.

Residual activity was assessed by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm.3.5. Classification of AR19M-311 and other ß-xylosidases based on sequence homologyWe searched for proteins similar to the ones originated from AR19M-311, which consisted of 752 amino acid residues, in the National Center for Biotechnology Information amino acid sequence database. The highest identity (71%) was exhibited by a predicted xylosidase/arabinosidase encoded by the genome of the bacterium Dictyoglomus thermophilum, although there is no experimental evidence confirming that this protein is a hydrolase. Among the known thermostable ß-xylosidases, the enzyme shared the highest homology (56%) with a ß-xylosidase from the archaeon S. solfataricus8 and the lowest homology (29%) with a ß-xylosidase from the fungus A. pullulans.9The phylogenetic relationship between AR19M-311 and other ß-xylosidases was determined using the ClustalX program (Fig. 5). AR19M-311 was classified in a thermostable ß-xylosidase cluster that included like enzymes from S. solfataricus and the bacteria T. thermarum, T. maritima, Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus, and Caldicellulosiruptor bescii.

Amino acid substitutions of proteins originated from AR19M-311The consensus amino acid sequence of AR19M-311 and those of the four proteins were compared, as shown in Fig. 6. Amino acid substitutions were observed for 11 residues (Thr57, Arg187, Val194, Ala206, Thr311, Val355, Ala451, Gly519, Ile625, Val635, and Lys739) of the consensus sequence. Comparing the thermostable proteins, AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M-311-21, and the non-thermostable protein AR19M-311-27, there were five residues that were substituted only with non-thermostable protein (Thr57 to Ile57, Ile311 to Thr311, Ala451 to Thr451, Gly519 to Ser519, and Lys739 to Asn739). AR19M-311-2 exhibited unique substitutions of Val355 with Ala and Val635 with Ile, but these substitutions might not be crucial for maintaining high activity because they were not found in the other thermostable proteins. Interestingly, Arg187, Val194, and Ala206 were only seen in the consensus sequence and not in the four proteins. Sequence alignment of AR19M-311 and its clones. The alignment was created by ClustalX version 2.0 and the residues substituted in any of the clone were highlighted by black background color and the residue numbers were indicated at the top of the residues. AR19M311 is the consensus sequence obtained from the ORF search. AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M-311-21 are the thermostable proteins, and AR19M-311-27 is the non-thermostable protein.Sequence alignment of AR19M-311 and its clones.

DiscussionHere, we carried out a comprehensive survey of thermostable ß-xylosidases using the metagenomic DNA of a microbial community isolated from the soil of a hot spring, which was 70 °C and pH 7.2 when sampled. Using two types of NGS analysers, a total of 84.2 Gbp of sequences were obtained from the metagenomic DNA. From 967,925 contigs calculated from the sequences, 168 ORFs were identified, most of which shared homology of less than 80% with known ß-xylosidases (Fig. 1). Of these 168 ORFs, 120 were successfully cloned from the metagenomic DNA. Including the SNPs that were identified by PCR-based cloning of the 120 ORFs, a total of 269 individual clones were obtained, and 82 proteins produced from these clones showed ß-xylosidase activity at 50 °C, demonstrating the usefulness of metagenomic approaches for identifying novel ß-xylosidases. Six genes, including three genes originated from AR19M-311, and genes originated from AR19M-319, AR19M-329, and AR19M-334, encoded enzymes showing thermal stability up to 90 °C (Fig. 2). This is a large-scaled survey for enzymatic activity of thermostable cellulases isolated from metagenomic DNA resources, which is, to our knowledge, the first report of thermostable ß-xylosidases isolated by a metagenomic approach.This study provided novel sequences of thermostable ß-xylosidases for further consideration of structure-activity relationships. AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M311-21 showed the highest activity at 90 °C and were stable at temperatures up to 70 °C for at least 1 h. As the ß-xylosidase from T. ethanolicus showed the highest optimal reaction temperature (93 °C),7 it was concluded that the three proteins are highly thermostable ß-xylosidases. Despite similarities in their thermal properties, the amino acid sequences shared 54% identity with T. ethanolicus ß-xylosidase. The ß-xylosidases from S. solfataricus and T. maritima, which have an optimal reaction temperature of 90 °C,4,8 are also considered highly thermostable ß-xylosidases. However, the sequence identity between these ß-xylosidases and the three proteins we describe was <60%. The sequence differences between these highly thermostable ß-xylosidases helped us identify a number of consensus and essential amino acids in the sequences of the highly thermostable ß-xylosidases, as discussed below.Analysis of the phylogenetic tree indicated that the prokaryotic thermostable ß-xylosidase cluster is more closely related to eukaryotic ß-xylosidases (which include those of plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago sativa and those of the fungi A. pullulans9 and Aspergillus sp.) than to the prokaryotic ß-xylosidases, which have not been reported as thermostable (Fig. 5). Therefore, comparative sequence analysis of these ß-xylosidases could also provide information that could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of high-temperature stability.From an integrated consideration of both the complete comparative sequence analysis and the local effects of amino acid substitutions, we identified some of the amino acid residues essential for the thermal stability of ß-xylosidases. Comparing the three thermostable proteins and the non-thermostable protein AR19M-311-27, the five residues were found as unique substitutions in AR19M-311-27 (Thr57 to Ile57, Ile311 to Thr311, Ala451 to Thr451, Gly519 to Ser519, and Lys739 to Asn739). In alignment of the sequences of the thermostable prokaryotic ß-xylosidases and eukaryotic ß-xylosidases (Supplementary Fig. S2), the Thr57 and the Ala451 was conserved in all of the thermostable enzymes, and the Gly519 was conserved in five of the six thermostable enzymes. Hence, the three substitutions of Thr57 to Ile57, Ala451 to Thr451 and Gly519 to Ser519 were considered to affect the low thermostability of AR19M-311-27 at 90°C. The alignment also showed that insertion of two amino acids, including Thr311 or the corresponding residues of other ß-xylosidases, occurs only in the thermostable prokaryotic ß-xylosidases and the moderately thermostable ß-xylosidase from Trichoderma koningii.16 The Thr residue is conserved in the four prokaryotic ß-xylosidases and substituted with Ile in the others. Therefore, we suggest that the insertion of the two amino acids contributes to the thermal stability of ß-xylosidases, which should be confirmed by future biochemical works. The contribution of the substitution of Lys739 to Asn739 on the thermostability is considered to be insignificant, because Lys739 is not conserved in thermostable enzymes. AR19M-311-2 also possessed the unique substitutions of Val355 with Ala and Val635 with Ile, substitutions not found in AR19M-311-11 and AR19M-311-21. These substitutions apparently have only a slight influence on thermostability, as Val, Ala, and Ile are all hydrophobic residues with similar properties.As shown by this study, PCR-based cloning of genes from metagenomic DNA is a useful method because it can lead to the identification of SNPs in consensus ORF sequences, which is advantageous for elucidating structure-activity relationships. There are two possible approaches to discover functional enzymes from metagenomic data. One is the homology search method demonstrated in this study, while the other is the activity-driven one. One of the advantages of the former method is that it could find highly homologous sequences with distinct activities from vast sequences, especially encoding active and non-active enzymes, which may lead speculation of function of each amino acid residue on the enzyme activity, as shown in our results of active forms, AR19M-311-2, AR19M-311-11, and AR19M-311-21 and a non-active form AR19M-311-27, which could not be obtained by the latter method alone. Recently, isolation of novel ß-galactosidases not predictable from gene sequences was reported,17 in which the enzymes were identified from a cosmid library with ~33 kbp metagenomic DNA in surrogate hosts by the activity-driven method. They emphasize the importance of developing of multi-host systems for functional screening to substantially extend the breadth of gene discovery. Therefore, either method may be used according to the purpose of research.
