PI489777, wild chickpea, genome sequence, annotation, diversity","Cicer reticulatum L. is the wild progenitor of the fourth most important legume crop chickpea (C. arietinum L.). We assembled short-read sequences into 416 Mb draft genome of C. reticulatum and anchored 78% (327 Mb) of this assembly to eight linkage groups. Genome annotation predicted 25,680 protein-coding genes covering more than 90% of predicted gene space. The genome assembly shared a substantial synteny and conservation of gene orders with the genome of the model legume Medicago truncatula. Resistance gene homologs of wild and domesticated chickpeas showed high sequence homology and conserved synteny. Comparison of gene sequences and nucleotide diversity using 66 wild and domesticated chickpea accessions suggested that the desi type chickpea was genetically closer to the wild species than the kabuli type. Comparative analyses predicted gene flow between the wild and the cultivated species during domestication. Molecular diversity and population genetic structure determination using 15,096 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed an admixed domestication pattern among cultivated (desi and kabuli) and wild chickpea accessions belonging to three population groups reflecting significant influence of parentage or geographical origin for their cultivar-specific population classification. The assembly and the polymorphic sequence resources presented here would facilitate the study of chickpea domestication and targeted use of wild Cicer germplasms for agronomic trait improvement in chickpea.1. IntroductionChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the only cultivated species in the genus Cicer. This is the fourth important legume crop after soybean (Glycine max), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and common pea (Pisum sativum). According to the seed morphology, chickpea is of two types; desi type with small dark brown seeds and kabuli with bold pale brown seeds. Recently, draft genome assemblies of both the chickpea types have been reported.1–3 Chickpea was domesticated with wheat, barley, peas and lentil as a member of West Asian Neolithic crops during the origin of agriculture around 10,000 years ago with the oldest archaeological evidence from 7500 B.C.4,5 The annual species C. reticulatum L. is considered to be the wild progenitor of the cultivated chickpea and both the species are interfertile, suggesting the wild as the primary gene pool of the cultigen. C. echinospermum D. is considered as the secondary gene pool and is crossable with both the wild progenitor and the cultivated chickpea, but shows a strong barrier to genic flux and the hybrids tend to be sterile. The other annual Cicer species may form the tertiary gene pool.6 In contrast to the wild progenitors of other Neolithic crops, C. reticulatum shows a narrow eco-geographic distribution indicating its limited adaptive variation, which caused the first bottleneck of genetic base of cultivated chickpea.4 Domestication of many crops occurred with a limited number of founding genotypes followed by subsequent selection. Selection of phenotypes included loss of dormancy, reduced pod dehiscence, larger plant and seed size with more erect habit (Fig. 1). However, the key feature of chickpea domestication was the change in the cropping season. While most of the crops with West Asian origin are autumn-sown, chickpea was transformed from an autumn-sown crop to a spring-sown crop to avoid Ascochyta blight caused by the fungus Ascochyta rabiei.7 This change in cropping season resulted in the separation of the reproductive phases of the cultivated species and the wild progenitor and caused another bottleneck in the genetic base. The major genetic difference that was selected for the change in cropping season was the loss of response to vernalization in the cultivated species.8Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideImages of field-grown wild (C. reticulatum L.)

The colour version of the figure is available online.Domestication process of most of the crops focused on improved yield, product size and organoleptic quality, however, tolerance to abiotic stresses and pathogen infection were compromised in this process. Naturally occurring resistant alleles in the wild relatives of the cultivated crops are an underexploited resource for plant breeding and can be introgressed into the elite cultivated genotypes to improve agricultural performance.9 Wild relatives are the vital source of higher natural allelic diversity, particularly for the improvement of cultivated crops with narrow genetic bases. They are also important for construction of high-density inter-specific genetic linkage maps and mapping of genes/QTLs (quantitative trait loci) governing agronomically important traits because of higher genomic polymorphism. Previously, genomes of the wild progenitors of some cultivated legume crops have been sequenced to decipher the genetic constitution of coding and non-coding components of their genomes and the process of domestication.10,11 An interspecies mapping population, generated by crossing a chickpea cultivar ICC4958 and its wild progenitor C. reticulatum PI489777, is being widely used as a reference to construct high-resolution genetic linkage maps for identification and mapping of genes/QTLs especially controlling important abiotic/biotic stress tolerance and domestication traits.12–15 Here, we report a draft genome assembly of the wild progenitor of cultivated chickpea C. reticulatum L. PI489777. Comparative analysis of wild and cultivated chickpea genome assemblies and the genomic resources would accelerate the understanding of molecular basis of selection during the domestication process and genetic enhancement of chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing and assemblyCicerreticulatum L. (accession PI489777) plants were grown in the plant growth chamber under controlled condition for 4 weeks before harvesting the fresh leaves for isolating genomic DNA using DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Cat no. 68163, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s protocol. The sequence data was generated by Illumina HiSeq1000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two individual whole genome shotgun (WGS) libraries with average insert size 180 base pair (bp), one WGS library with average insert size 500 bp and one mate-pair (MP) library each of 3,000 and 10,000 bp average insert sizes were prepared and sequenced in 100 baseX2 paired-end (PE) format following manufacturer’s protocol for the assembly. The raw sequence reads were filtered using NGS toolkit with default parameter for obtaining high-quality reads.16 Filtered reads were assembled by three tools namely, SOAPdenovo2, MaSuRCA and ALLPATHS-LG using a 512 GB RAM and 48 core server.17–19 Finally, the best assembly with ALLPATHS-LG version SL 2.0 with ploidy 2 and default parameters was used for analysis. The minimum scaffold size was kept as 1 kb. Scaffolds were ordered in the linkage groups following the marker sequences of a linkage map constructed using a bi-parental RIL (recombinant inbred line) mapping population (C. arietinum acc. ICC 4958 x C. reticulatum acc. PI 489777).20 The gaps of unknown sizes were joined with 100 N as per National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) guideline. Transcriptome coverage in the genome assembly was verified using BLAT.21 The assembly was submitted to NCBI under the Bioproject PRJNA263699. The sequence reads were submitted to the short read archive (SRA) of NCBI under the IDs SRR160365, SRR1640444, SRR1640451 and SRR1640455. Reference-based genome assemblies were generated by mapping the C. reticulatum WGS reads on ICC4958 (desi) and CDC Frontier (kabuli) genome assemblies using bwa mapping tool with default parameter and producing consensus sequence.1,3,222.2. Gene annotationGene annotation was performed following the pipeline described previously. Briefly, repeat sequences were identified and masked by the software packages REPEATMODELLER, PILER, REPEATSCOUT, LTR_FINDER REPEATMASKER (http://repeatmasker.org) and REPEATPROTEIN MASK.23–26 Repeat-masked assembly was used for annotating protein-coding genes by ab initio, homology-based and EST-based approaches. Augustus and GENESCAN tools trained with Arabidopsis data were used for ab initio prediction. EXONERATE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/) and PASA27 tools were used for the homology-based and EST-based annotations, respectively, using predicted proteome sequences of desi and kabuli chickpeas1,2 and assembled transcriptome of C. reticulatum.28 Outputs from these three approaches were integrated by EVIDENCEMODELLER (EVM)29 to generate consensus gene sets and the EVM output was run through PASA for prediction of spliced variants and various elements like untranslated regions. Filtering parameters of minimum coding sequence (CDS) of 150 base pairs (bp) and low N-content (<10%) were applied to arrive at the final predicted gene set. To resolve annotation differences between the orthologous gene pairs of wild and cultivated chickpeas during comparative analysis, corresponding gene sequences of both the genotypes were re-annotated using Augustus only for a better comparison. Gene annotation of the reference-based assembly was done by following the annotation files of the corresponding assemblies.For functional annotation, the predicted protein sequences were searched with various databases such as, ntdb of NCBI, TrEMBL, UniRef100, SwissProt, TAIR and KEGG with cut off E value 1e-5. Resistance gene homologues (RGH) were identified following a previously described method.3 Briefly, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles were created for different R gene families using sequences present in the plant resistance gene database. These HMM profiles were used to identify the primary RGH set. These sequences were further screened for the presence of specific RGH-protein domains using InterPro scan and a search in the NCBI conserved domain database.2.3. Mining of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletionsSequence reads were filtered with NGS tool kit.16 Filtered reads were mapped on the reference sequences using bwa mapping tool. Only uniquely mapped reads were considered for further analysis. The sam files were converted to bam files using samtools, and then to vcf format to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions (InDels). High quality SNPs were identified using only unique non-reference alleles supported by five or more reads (in case of C. reticulatum WGS reads) and/or three or more reads (in case of restriction-associated genotyping-by-sequencing reads). SNPs on pseudomolecules of eight linkage groups were plotted and visualized by Circos.30 Reference-based genome assemblies, reference-based gene annotation and the vcf files of the SNPs/InDels are curated at the website nipgr.res.in/WCGAP/.2.4. Pair-wise comparison of genomes and genesGene cluster analysis was performed by all-against-all BLASTP search of the proteomes of all the concerned plants followed by orthoMCL.31 Pair-wise sequence comparison between the pseudomolecules of wild and cultivated chickpea was performed using default parameters of SyMap v4.0.32 The whole genome dot plot with eight linkage groups of wild and desi chickpeas was generated by selecting hits with >90% identity. Inter-species gene order colinearity was detected by MCScanX33 with default parameter considering BLASTP =1e-5. Orthologous genes between the wild and cultivated chickpea were identified by BLASTP. Links of collinear gene blocks between the pseudomolecules of two species were shown by dual synteny or circle plot. Protein sequences of orthologous gene-pairs were aligned by ClustalW34. The output file and CDS sequences of the corresponding genes were used to determine synonymous substitution rate (Ks) by PAL2NAL and CODEML in PAML4.5.35,36 Species divergence was calculated using the equation T = Ks/2r. The value of r was taken as 6.1 × 10 - 9 per year.372.5. Diversity analysisStacks pipeline was used to build loci for restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequence reads.38 The SNP-based genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among cultivated and wild chickpea accessions were determined using cladogram interface of TASSEL5.0 (http://www.maizegenetics.net/#!tassel/c17q9). For assessment of population structure among chickpea accessions, the SNP genotyping data were analyzed in STRUCTURE following the methods of Kujur et al.39 For determining nucleotide diversity in the intergenic regions, 2 kb up- and downstream regions of gene sequences according to direction of their annotation in the genome were considered. Significance analysis was performed by Wilcoxon rank sum test and paired t-test using R stats package (https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html).3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyWe prepared 3 paired-end libraries; 2 with 180 bp and 1 with 500 bp insert sizes, along with 2 mate-pair (MP) libraries with 3 kb and 10 kb insert sizes and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq1000 platform to generate 100 × 2 bp short sequence reads. The filtered high quality 1,198,234,588 reads (~119 Gb) (Supplementary Table S1) were used for de novo assembly using ALLPATHS-LG, SOAPdenovo2 and MaSuRCA. ALLPATHS-LG produced a better output in comparison to other assembly tools in terms of number and lengths of the scaffolds, generating total scaffold length of 416,562,993 bp at 49X estimated genome coverage (Supplementary Table S2). ALLPATHS-LG predicted an estimated genome size of 817.64 Mb at k-mer 25 and 63% of the genome was estimated to be repetitive, while distribution frequency of k-mer 17 by Jellyfish predicted an estimated genome size of 802.003 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1)40. The assembly tool generated total 7,383 scaffolds with N50 and average sizes of 216.8 and 56.534 kb, respectively, from 35,261 contigs with N50 and minimum sizes of 23.2 and 1 kb, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Seventeen small scaffolds showing significant similarity with bacterial genome sequences were removed by us and NCBI. Approximately 1,651 scaffolds were anchored to eight linkage groups (LGs) using marker sequences of a linkage map constructed using a RIL mapping population of C. arietinum ICC4958 X C. reticulatum PI48977718 to generate eight pseudomolecules of total 327.07 Mb (Supplementary Table S4) within the total assembly of 416,658,930 bp distributed in 5,723 fragments. N50 length of the whole assembly was 39.84 Mb and the largest assembled pseudomolecule was LG6 with 58.23 Mb in length (Supplementary Table S5). Out of 1,651 anchored scaffolds, 1,081 scaffolds (~65%) covering 283.74 Mb (86.77% of total pseudomolecule length) were oriented. Less than 1,000 fragments contributed to more than 90% of the assembly (Supplementary Fig. S2). Approximately 74.64 and 48.33% reads of WGS and MP libraries, respectively, were mapped back and covered the whole genome assembly (Supplementary Table S6). Paired reads of the 3 and 10 kb MP libraries were mapped to the average distances of 2662 ± 496 bp and 9002 ± 1226 bp, respectively, as a validation of the assembly. Mapping of an earlier reported transcriptome assembly of C. reticulatum28 showed alignment of 90.74% (33,815 of 37,265 tentative contigs) assembled transcript on the genome assembly with =90% identity with =80% coverage. About 97% (1,136,248 of 1,171,453 reads) of high-quality transcriptome sequence reads could be mapped on the genome assembly. Core eukaryotic genes mapping approach (CEGMA)41 analysis was able to map 319 (~70%) of total 458 core eukaryotic genes with full coverage and 426 (~93%) genes with more than 90% coverage and E-value 1e-10. Both these data suggested that more than 90% of C. reticulatum gene space has been covered in the present genome assembly. For a better comparative analysis with the available chickpea genome assemblies,1,3 sequence reads of C. reticulatum were mapped on both the chickpea genome assemblies and two reference-based consensus genome assemblies of C. reticulatum were produced. The chickpea var. ICC4958 (desi) reference-based assembly was of 440,184,772 bp and the same for chickpea var. CDC Frontier (kabuli) was of 421,850,125 bp in lengths (Supplementary Table S7). Polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) between the wild and two domesticated chickpea draft assemblies and the flanking sequences were listed (Supplementary Table S8) as a resource for developing genetic markers. Salient features of the assembly are mentioned in Table 1. Assembly and annotation statistics of C. reticulatum genomeAssembly and annotation statistics of C. reticulatum genome3.2. Genome annotation and comparative analysis of protein-coding genesUsing repeat-masked assembly, the protein-coding genes were predicted by three approaches (ab initio, homology-based and EST-based), followed by generating a high confidence non-redundant set of consensus genes by merging their results. A total of 25,680 non-redundant consensus genes spanning 85.786 Mb with a gene density of 6.1 genes per 100 kb was predicted. A sum of 666 genes was predicted to have average 2.08 transcript isoforms resulting in total 26,404 protein coding DNA sequences (CDS). Average gene length was 3.34 kb with 5.76 exons per gene and the total CDS length was 30.622 Mb with an average length 1.192 kb. A total of 22,259 genes were located on the pseudomolecules (Supplementary Table S9). Annotation of the reference-based assemblies following the annotation coordinates of the reference assemblies resulted in identification of 27,722 and 23,656 genes for ICC4958- and CDC Frontier-based assemblies. The number of predicted genes by de novo annotation was less because of less availability of wild chickpea ESTs in the public databases. The ab initio and EST-based approaches predicted 27,151 and 25,946 gene models, respectively, resulting in annotation of 25,680 high confidence consensus gene models. A clustering analysis of the de novo protein sets showed that a total of 64,904 proteins belonging to 15,068 families were shared by wild, desi (ICC4958) and kabuli (CDC Frontier) chickpeas, while 17,314 and 15,695 protein families were shared by the wild and desi, and the wild and kabuli chickpeas, respectively. A sum of 131 proteins belonging to 59 families of the wild chickpea were not shared with either desi or kabuli chickpea (Supplementary Fig. S3). Notably, 97.64% (25,075) predicted proteins displayed significant sequence similarity (=1e-5 by BLAST search) with at least one of the public protein databases analyzed (Supplementary Table S10). 15.70% (4033) of the total wild chickpea CDSs did not show any sequence variation with those of desi chickpea, while sequences of 12.02% (3209) wild chickpea CDSs were identical with those of kabuli chickpea. Approximately 83.62% (21,475) of wild chickpea CDSs showed significant sequence similarity (=90% identity with =80% coverage) with the desi chickpea CDSs in contrast to 74.65% (19,170) with kabuli chickpea CDSs. In case of protein sequence, 73.50% (18,876) and 63.46% (16,296) of predicted proteins of C. reticulatum showed significant sequence similarity (=95% identity with =80% coverage) with the predicted protein sets of desi and kabuli chickpea, respectively (Supplementary Table S11). All these observations emphasized that the desi type chickpea was closer to the wild progenitor C. reticulatum in evolution as compared to the kabuli type chickpea.3.3. Genomic featuresPutative pericentromeric region in each linkage group of C. reticulatum assembly was delineated by comparing genetic and physical distances and mapping the repeat and gene densities (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S12). Gene density in the pericentromeric region was 5.1 genes/100 kb, in contrast to 9.3 genes/100 kb in the euchromatic region. Average recombination rate in the pericentromeric region (1,921 kb/cM) was similar to that in the desi chickpea assembly (1,691 kb/cM).3 This high pericentromeric recombination rate (4,350 kb/cM in Phaseolus vulgaris) indicated less anchoring of sequence scaffolds in the pericentromeric region due to lack of markers and scarcity of longer scaffolds. Poor gene density (3.8 genes/100 kb) in the un-anchored scaffolds indicated that those mostly belonged to the pericentromeric region. C. reticulatum genome shared a substantial synteny and conservation of gene orders with the genome of the model legume Medicago truncatula (Medicago) (Fig. 2). Total 17,154 genes of Medicago and C. reticulatum existed in 849 colinear blocks of 5 or more genes. The highest synteny was observed between Medicago chromosome 1 (Mt1) and C. reticulatum LG 4 (Cr4) with 82 colinear blocks comprising of 2,037 genes, followed by the synteny between Mt3 and Cr5 with 52 blocks of 1,475 genes and between Mt2 and Cr1 with 41 blocks of 1,445 genes (Supplementary Table S13). C. reticulatum genome assembly was compared with that of the desi chickpea (ICC4958). The same genetic map was used for both the assemblies and, therefore, pseudomolecules in both the assemblies shared an overall synteny at the sequence level (Supplementary Fig. S5) and gene order level (Supplementary Fig. S6) for LGs 2, 6 and 7. The other pseudomolecules showed a few disagreements. Although, extensive local gene collinearity was observed in all the pseudomolecules, incongruity in the positions and orientations of a few gene blocks between the corresponding pseudomolecules of LG1, 3, 5 and 8 were observed. The most disagreement was observed in the upper arm of LG4. These disagreements might have resulted from relatively more dependence on the genetic map for anchoring a large number of scaffolds in case of ICC4958. Comparatively larger scaffolds were anchored in case of C. reticulatum using a fewer genetic markers and most of them are oriented.

Therefore, the resistance gene homologues (RGH) of C. reticulatum were analyzed in detail in comparison to those of the domesticated chickpea. Total 116 RGH were identified in the wild chickpea assembly following stringent criteria described previously.3 However, when the gene sequences of 133 RGH, identified in the advanced draft genome of chickpea ICC4958, were mapped on the wild chickpea genome, four more RGH were obtained (Supplementary Text S1), which were not annotated before. Three clusters of R genes were observed in the wild chickpea genome each in LG3, 5 and 6. Among all identified RGH, 22 belong to TIR-NBS-LRR and 28 belong to CC-NBS-LRR families (Supplementary Table S14). One hundred four RGH of wild chickpea were orthologous to those of ICC4958, of which coding sequences of 80 orthologous pairs were of same length including 24 identical pairs. The remaining 24 orthologous pairs showed length differences due to InDels in the exons. Experimental validation of most of their sequence was not possible due to lack of the corresponding transcript sequences in the databases. Only two of them were verified by comparing the transcript sequences (Supplementary Text S2). One of those (Cr_03218) belonged to CC-NBS family and is orthologous to Ca_03824 of ICC4958 and XM_004490520.2 of CDC Frontier and showed 69 base-deletion in the exon 3. Cr_03218 is orthologous to RGA4 known for resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.42 The other (Cr_10687) belonged to NBS-LRR family and is orthologous to Ca_09490 of ICC4958 and XM_012715315.1 of CDC Frontier showed 9 base deletion in the exon1 of the gene. Cr_10687 is orthologous to RPM1 gene, well known for conferring resistance against bacterial leaf spot caused by Pseudomonus syringae pv. maculicola.43 Of the remaining 16 genes of total 120 RGHs, 3 genes were not found in the cultivated chickpea assemblies, 3 genes showed large deletions in the wild species as compared to the corresponding genes in the cultivated species and 10 genes showed deletion in the wild chickpea assembly due to the presence of ambiguous bases (N). Total 34 RGHs are present in 9 clusters (3 or more RGH within 2 Mb) in C. reticulatum genome assembly (Fig. 3a). LG6 showed the presence of total 9 RGHs in 2 clusters. Six RGHs were found present in LG1 in a cluster. Each of LG2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 showed the presence of 1 RGH cluster. Seven of these clusters were collinear with the CDC Frontier genome assembly. Colinearity of other two clusters could not be confirmed due to the presence of the orthologous genes in unanchored scaffolds of the CDC Frontier assembly. A cluster analysis of the predicted RGHs in the wild and desi chickpea assemblies showed high sequence conservation without any outlier group (Supplementary Fig. S7). Total 54 RGH of Medicago showed colinearity with C. reticulatum RGHs (Supplementary Table S15). Orthologues of some well-known RGH, such as RGA4, TMV resistance gene N44 and powdery mildew resistance gene RPW845 can be traced comparing C. reticulatum and Medicago genomes through syntenic relationship (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Sequence diversity between the wild and cultivated chickpeaSequence reads of C. reticulatum PI489777 were mapped on pseudomolecules of eight assembled linkage groups of chickpea cultivars CDC Frontier and ICC4958 to analyze genome-wide distribution of SNPs and InDels (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Table S16). LG4 of both the assemblies showed the presence of the highest number of SNPs and InDels supporting the previous observation that LG4 is the most variable among all the linkage groups.1,3 The rate of synonymous substitutions (Ks) were calculated for 15,403 and 12,780 orthologous gene pairs between wild-desi and wild-kabuli, respectively, to ascertain diversification periods of the domesticated species from the wild species. The plot of Ks values against the number of gene pairs showed two peaks of diversification, one sharp peak at 0.0001 and another diffused peak around 0.006 (Fig. 3b). Similar pattern was observed when the transcriptome sequences of the domesticated and wild chickpeas were compared.46 The diffused peak around Ks 0.006 corresponds to speciation around 0.5 million years ago, while the peak at 0.0001 possibly suggests recent gene flow from the wild during the domestication process as both the wild and domesticated species are interfertile. To investigate that, SNP frequencies were compared between the intergenic regions of the orthologous gene pairs constituting these peaks. The SNP frequencies in the intergenic regions of the corresponding gene pairs of the younger peak (0.0055 bp-1) was significantly lower (P-value < 0.0001) than that of the older peak (0.0090 bp-1) suggesting gene flow from the wild to cultivated chickpea. Linkage groups of the present wild chickpea genome assembly was used as the reference for mapping restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequence reads generated from 10 C. reticulatum, and 56 (28 each of desi and kabuli) cultivated chickpea accessions to assess sequence diversities. Total 15,096 SNPs discovered revealed high average pair-wise nucleotide diversity within the wild (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.338) as compared to that within the cultivated chickpeas (0.296). Nucleotide diversities were compared between the wild and domesticated accessions in the intergenic regions of the orthologous gene pairs representing two aforementioned younger and older peaks. The nucleotide diversity in the intergenic regions of the genes belonging to younger peak (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.33) was significantly lower (P-value < 0.0063) than that of the older peak (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.37) further implicating the occurrence of gene flow from the wild to the domesticated chickpea. Nucleotide diversities of the wild and domesticated chickpeas were plotted along the linkage groups (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S17). Expectedly, LG 4 showed the highest average nucleotide variation within the wild (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.389) and the domesticated chickpeas (<U+03B8><U+03A0> = 0.320). Out of total 7,185 SNPs within the wild chickpea accessions, 3,615 SNPs were found to be present in all 10 C.reticulatum accessions, and 1,083 and 611 of these were shared with all the desi and kabuli accessions, respectively. Four hundred and thirty-nine SNPs were found common in all the wild and domesticated chickpeas used in this study. Flanking sequences of the unique SNPs present within the wild, desi and kabuli chickpeas were provided as marker resource (Supplementary Table S18).Although, there are many contrasting phenotypic differences between wild and cultivated chickpeas and also between the desi and kabuli landraces such as, erectness, seed coat and flower colour, sizes of seed, leaf and whole plant, in contrast to other grain legumes, the major trait for chickpea domestication was the change in the cropping season and associated loss of vernalization response.47 In Arabidopsis, functional VRN1 and VRN2 genes are required to maintain vernalization response.48,49VRN1 and VRN2 orthologues in the wild and domesticated chickpea genome assemblies did not show any sequence variation in the CDS. However, 5'-upstream activating sequences (5'-UAS) of VRN1 orthologues in the desi and kabuli genome assemblies showed a 35 base insertion at around 1.1 kb upstream of the translation start codon as compared to their orthologue in the wild chickpea. Ten accessions each of desi and kabuli chickpea and 4 accessions of C. reticulatum were used to verify this sequence variation by PCR amplification followed by sequencing. All the 20 chickpea cultivars used showed 35 base larger amplification products than the 4 accessions of wild chickpea (Supplementary Fig. S10). On the other hand, in case of VRN2 orthologue located at LG8, a conversion of a dinucleotide repeat (TC)15, present around 200 bp upstream to the translation start codon in the wild genotype, to (TC)49 and (TC)25 was observed in the desi and the kabuli genome assemblies, respectively. This sequence variation was verified in 10 accessions each of desi and kabuli chickpea and 4 accessions of C. reticulatum. The extent of this repeat varied in the domesticated and wild accessions when investigated by PCR amplification. However, all the used wild accessions displayed shorter repeat sequence than the cultivated accessions (Supplementary Fig. S11). Further investigations are required to associate these structural variations with the vernalization response in chickpea.3.6 Molecular diversity, phylogeny and population genetic structureThe estimation of pair-wise genetic distance among 28 accessions each of desi and kabuli chickpea and 10 accessions of wild C. reticulatum (Supplementary Table S19) using 15,096 SNPs physically mapped over eight pseudomolecules of LGs of the present assembly depicted a wide range of distance coefficient from 0.13 to 0.56 with an average of 0.35. The genetic distance between the desi and kabuli cultivar groups (distance coefficient 0.35) was least as compared to that of desi versus wild (0.42) and kabuli versus wild (0.45). The genetic relationship among 56 cultivated and 10 wild chickpea accessions was depicted in an unrooted dendrogram (Fig. 4a). The SNPs clearly discriminated all the 66 accessions from each other resulting in a definite grouping among desi and kabuli and wild chickpeas. The accessions belonging to wild C. reticulatum were clustered together in a group distinctly from the desi and kabuli cultivars.

The colour version of the figure is available online. The population genetic structure was determined among the 66 cultivated and wild accessions using the physically mapped SNPs. The optimization of population structure at varying levels of K (K = 2–10) with 20 replications revealed that at K value of 3, all the 66 cultivated and wild accessions were classified majorly into three distinct populations, wild, kabuli and desi as per expected pedigree relationships and parentage (Fig. 4b). This was agreed-well with the clustering pattern as observed among 66 chickpea accessions by the phylogenetic tree analysis using pair-wise genetic distances (Fig. 4a). Based on population structure analysis, the population group I consisting of 10 accessions of wild C. reticulatum, group II with 26 and 4 accessions of kabuli and desi, respectively and group III having 24 and 2 accessions of desi and kabuli, respectively. The molecular genetic variation among and within the three populations based on the SNPs exhibited a wider level of quantitative genetic differentiation (FST varied from 0.17 to 0.54 with an average of 0.38) among three population groups. Among the three population groups, the divergence was maximum between group II (kabuli) and group I (wild) (FST = 0.47) and minimum between group III (desi) and group II (kabuli) (FST = 0.15). The proportion of FST and thus diversity between the population groups was higher as compared to that estimated within populations. Higher genetic differentiation was observed in kabuli than that of desi. All the 6 cultivated chickpea and 10 wild accessions clearly belonged to a single population in which about 81.3% of their inferred ancestry was derived from one of the model-based population and remaining ~18.7% contained admixed ancestry. Maximum admixture (~12%) was observed between group II (kabuli) and group III (desi) populations followed by group III (desi) and group I (wild) (~4%) and group II (kabuli) and wild (~2%) populations (Fig. 4b).DISCUSSIONWild relatives of chickpea are underexploited resource for introducing genomic variation in the domesticated species, which is suffering from a narrow genetic base. The draft genome assembly of the inter-crossable wild progenitor C. reticulatum would provide an excellent resource for studying allelic variation and domestication of chickpea. The assembled pseudomolecules of eight linkage groups in the present draft assembly are equivalent in length to those in the published assemblies of the cultivated species1,3 and were constructed with larger sequence scaffolds. Almost the whole gene spaces of the respective species have been covered in the corresponding assemblies and, therefore, the analyses presented in this report including the resource of polymorphic SSRs and SNPs between the wild and the domesticated species would provide a significant resource for genome-wide large-scale genotyping applications. The reference-based assemblies produced by mapping C. reticulatum reads on two chickpea draft genome assemblies could be used for direct comparison between the wild and the domesticated species. Domestication process of chickpea followed a different course from the other crops domesticated in Fertile Crescent.4 Geographical distributions of two domesticated chickpea types are distinctly separate. While the kabuli type is restricted mostly in the Western Mediterranean, the desi type is mostly grown in the Central Asia and Indian subcontinent. It is possible that the domestication traits were fixed before the evolution of agriculture and subsequent selection based on local adaptation occurred during domestication. Comparative analysis showed desi type chickpea genome was relatively closer to the wild as compared to the kabuli type. However, at present, selection of kabuli type from desi type chickpea50 appears unlikely because of extent of genomic variations between this two types considering separation of only a few thousand years. Additionally, molecular diversity analysis clearly separates these two types. Therefore, an early separation predating agriculture followed by domestication-associated selection according to local adaptability may provide an alternative hypothesis of chickpea domestication process.Detection of a wider molecular diversity and genetic base using genome-wide SNPs would be much relevant in establishing distinctness and selection of desirable plant types for varietal improvement in chickpea. As expected, the correspondence of clustering pattern obtained among the accessions belonging to desi, kabuli and wild chickpea groups with the pedigree relationship and parentage further suggests that the molecular diversity assessed by genome-wide SNPs is realistic and thus would be useful in chickpea genomics-assisted breeding. The admixed ancestry among three populations might be due to their complex breeding history involving inter-crossing and introgression among desi, kabuli and wild chickpea accessions along with strong selection pressure and evolutionary bottleneck during chickpea domestication.4,51 Higher admixture (~5%) among 2 wild C. reticulatum accessions (ILWC 247 and ILWC 242) and 1 each of desi (ICC 16374) and kabuli (ICC 11847) accessions originated from Syria is expected due to involvement of C. reticulatum as one of the parents in cross-breeding program for their varietal improvement. This reflects more influence of parentage/geographical origination rather than cultivar-specific classification especially in higher admixed 6 desi and kabuli and 3 wild C. reticulatum accessions. Collectively, the genome assembly and annotation of the wild progenitor of chickpea, and the comparative analysis with the domesticated species would increase opportunities for more strategic use of the wild germplasms for improved crop management.We acknowledge funding from the National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India.

While special attention is paid to comparative genomic analysis among clinical relevant isolates, in this study we performed an exhaustive comparative analysis of enterococcal genomes of food origin and/or with potential to be used as probiotics. Beyond common genetic features, we especially aimed to identify those that are specific to enterococcal strains isolated from a certain food-related source as well as features present in a species-specific manner. Thus, the genome sequences of 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, were examined and compared. Their phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed based on orthologous proteins and whole genomes. Likewise, markers associated with a successful colonization (bacteriocin genes and genomic islands) and genome plasticity (phages and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) were investigated for lifestyle specific genetic features. At the same time, a search for antibiotic resistance genes was carried out, since they are of big concern in the food industry. Finally, it was possible to locate 1617 FIGfam families as a core proteome universally present among the genera and to determine that most of the accessory genes code for hypothetical proteins, providing reasonable hints to support their functional characterization.1. IntroductionThe genus Enterococcus (E.) belongs to the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) group and includes nearly 50 species characterized for being facultative anaerobic, non-spore forming and catalase-negative.1,2 They can be associated with humans, animals, plants, water and fermented foods or used as probiotics. Their application in the production of artisanal fermented products such as cheeses, meats and olives, inter alia is founded on their contribution in the typical taste and flavor of the final products as well as on their hygienic quality.1,3 The genus has also the potential to promote health by stimulating the immune system, assisting digestion and maintaining normal intestinal microflora and is thus frequently used in probiotic preparations.4,5 Despite the aforementioned, they are also known for their potential to cause disease being the antimicrobial resistance transferability and virulence phenomena of paramount importance.6The advent of next-generation technologies has allowed the number of sequenced bacterial genomes to multiply and consequently, has given the possibility of carrying out numerous comparative studies seeking to establish patterns of behavior and evolutionary relationships.7 Tettelin et al.8 introduced the concept of pan-genome. This term refers to the global gene repertoire of a group of organisms consisting of a core genome (genes present in all members of the group) and a dispensable genome (unique and accessory genes present in one or more than one but not all organisms, respectively).8 Numerous studies evidenced that the gene content of a genome and it structure can be affected during organism’s adaptation to a specific niche9 and are the consequence, between others, of processes like horizontal gene transfer (HGT), genome rearrangement and gene loss. For the bacterial family Vibrionaceae, Kahlke et al. showed that unique core genes appear more often in groups of isolates with a common ancestor (monophyletic) and, in the particular case of Vibrio cholerae, play a fundamental role in its adaptation to the ecological niche. Likewise, they indicated that in genophyletic groups of isolates (with no closest common ancestor) core genes are mainly the result of HGT.9 In Pseudomonas putida, meanwhile, the presence of genomic islands carrying genes related to it specific lifestyle pointed out HGT as the driving force of it adaptation to a certain niche.10 In relation to LAB, Douillard and de Vos described that the enormous diversity in the members of this group, as evidenced by comparative genomics studies, is the result of genome-environment interactions. The availability of nutrients in a specific habitat have a direct impact on metabolic properties of LAB. Many species present an enrichment in genes encoding for transporters (ABC or PTS systems) to compensate the loss of genes of biosynthetic pathways.11The study of enterococcal genomes has grown considerably in recent years with special attention in comparative genomic analysis among clinical relevant isolates. In this sense, several studies have focused on the comparison of the safety aspects of clinical and non-clinical E. faecium and E. faecalis strains12 but, to our knowledge, Enterococcus species of food origin have not been investigated in detail so far, what is surprising given the abundance of these microorganisms in certain fermented food.Through an exhaustive comparative genomic analysis the goal of our manuscript was to identify common genetic features, features that are specific to enterococcal strains isolated from a certain food related source as well as those present in a species-specific manner. Furthermore, since several studies have shown that foodborne enterococci have a great potential as probiotics,13,14Enterococcus strains with probiotic properties were also incorporated to the analysis in spite of having or not food as natural niche. In this way, we sought to evaluate, at the genomic level, which were the shared traits between probiotics and food related strains. For this, the genome sequences of 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, who were the only one with full information about the isolation source by the time of data collection, were selected. Their phylogenetic relationship was determined at nucleotide and amino acid level comparing whole genome alignments and orthologous proteins, respectively. In addition, a search for markers associated with a successful colonization (bacteriocin genes and genomic islands) and genome plasticity (phages and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) was performed. Since antibiotic resistance is of big concern in the food industry, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes was also investigated.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequences and annotationAccording to their isolation source and probiotic potential 25 enterococcal genomic sequences, belonging to seven different species, were retrieved from the NCBI database from December 2014 to July 2015; these included: E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. mundtii, E. hirae, E. malodoratus, E. raffinosus and E. durans. In a next step, the strains were assigned to one of three major groups: dairy isolates, meat isolates and probiotics; and a fourth group was created: probiotics with dairy origin, for those strains with both properties. The dataset thus comprises 3 complete and 22 draft genomes.In order rely on a directly comparable annotation of genes, we performed a functional annotation combined with a metabolic reconstruction using the RAST (Rapid Annotation Subsystem Technology) webservice.15 For running the analyses the following settings were made: RAST for gene calling, FIGfam Release 70 as the collection of protein families, backfilling of gaps and automatic fixing of errors. Besides rRNAs and tRNAs, RAST identifies protein coding genes and allowed us to achieve a high quality assessment of the gene functions and their genomic context.2.2. Phylogenetic analysisWhole genomes of all enterococcal species and strains including Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, Lactococcus garvieae Lg2, Listeria monocytogenes HCC23 and Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 as outgroups were aligned using progressive Mauve.16 All reported alignment blocks present in at least two genomes were concatenated. As using all species and strains at once partially lead to weak bootstrap scores (<10%, probably due to much missing data for incomplete genomes, data not shown), the tree was constructed iteratively in two steps. At species level, we substituted species with multiple strains by a single representative strain that had a fully sequenced genome, namely E. faecalis str. Symbioflor 1 for E. faecalis, E. faecium NRRLB-2354 for E. faecium and E. mundtii ATCC882 for E. mundtii. The resulting 8,602,893 nt long multiple alignment was used in a rapid bootstrap analysis with RAxML v8.1.2017 with 1000 replicates to search for best-scoring maximum likelihood tree with respect to the GTR substitution model and the Gamma model of rate heterogeneity.18 We performed the same analysis at strain level separately for each species resulting in multiple alignments of lengths 3,336,408 nt for E. faecalis, 4,304,502 nt for E. faecium and 5,683,060 nt for E. mundtii. In the latter alignment, E. malodoratus had to be added as phylogenetic trees cannot be reconstructed from three instances (strains) only. It was removed from the resulting tree after reconstruction.We used Proteinortho v5.1.1219 to determine universally conserved 1:1-orthologs in all species and strains (including the four outgroup species as above) with respect to the proteins annotated through RAST (E-value: 1e-10, algebraic connectivity:0). Groups containing any paralogs were removed. Hence, the resulting 455 orthologous groups contained highly similar proteins present once in all species of interest. Amino acid sequences of orthologous proteins were aligned using ClustalOmega v1.2.1.20 The resulting alignment was cropped at both ends till leading and trailing gaps were removed. All alignments were concatenated to single sequences representing one species/strain each resulting in a multiple sequence alignment of 134,771 aa. Based on these, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using RAxML v8.1.2017. A rapid bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates to search for best-scoring maximum likelihood tree with respect to the LG matrix and the Gamma model of rate heterogeneity18 was performed. To make sure we did not observe effects due to over-representation of some species (E. faecium is present with 13 strains in the dataset comprising 29 genomes) the phylogenetic reconstruction was repeated using only one representative strain for species with multiple strains as described above. Their tree topologies were equivalent (data not shown) indicating no such effect.3. Niche-specific proteins and core proteomeWe directly used the FIGfam annotation classes provided by RAST to group predicted proteins according to their function. We want to note that these classes usually encapsulate multiple instances of different proteins (e.g. paralogs) and thus provide a rough approximation of function rather than reflecting fine-grained homology relations. For each enterococci group (dairy, meat, probiotics) and combination of groups (e.g. dairy and meat and so on), we set a filter such that only those classes remain that are present in at least a given percentage of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group. Thereby, the two strains that are probiotics but were extracted from a dairy origin, E. faecium L-3 and E. faecalis MB5259, were dynamically assigned to either group (e.g. to dairy when the dairy group was checked). In order to avoid species specific results, we removed all genes solely found in strains of a single species.Given the amount of incomplete genomes (missing data) and diversity of seven different species it was not surprising that no niche specific genes could be located when applying a presence threshold of 100–60%. At 50% a number of specific gene classes were located but not for dairy and the meat/probiotic combination. We decreased it further to 40% in order to recover specificities of all groups under this study. As statistical evaluation we repeated the analysis 1000 times with random group labels (fixed group sizes) and counted how often a gene family would be reported specific for any group. The results were used as expectation values (E-values), e.g. FIG00632402 was reported 26 times in random 1000 runs and therefore is represented with an E-value of 0.026.4. Genomic features4.1. Bacteriocin and antibiotic resistance genesBacteriocin-coding genes were searched using BAGEL 321. Mining for modified and non-modified bacteriocins was carried out following two different approaches, one based on the analysis of the gene context, and the other on the identification of the gene itself. Since the gene coding for Enterocin A, entA, could not be located by this program, it was manually assessed by BLAST22 using the sequence firstly described by Aymerich et al.23 (GI: 1296521) as a query and the enterococcal genomes as the database (E-value = 8e-100).Furthermore, a search for antibiotic resistance genes was performed through the ARG-ANNOT tool.24 For this a BLAST22 in Bioedit25 against the ARG-ANNOT database (April 2015, http://en.mediterranee-infection.com/article.php?laref=23%26titre=arg-annot) was carried out. We used moderately stringent conditions (E-Value  =  1e-5), the Blosum 62 substitution matrix26 and allowed for gapped blast hits. To reduce redundancy, only those results with = 70% of query coverage and = 90% sequence identity were taken into account. The antibiotics classes included in the database are: aminoglycosides, beta-lactamases, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, macrolide-lincosamid-estreptogramin, phenicols, rifampicin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim.4.2. Prophage sequences and CRISPRs—Cas systemsIntact and incomplete prophage regions were identified through the integrated search and annotation tool PHAST.27 This involved an ORF prediction and translation with GLIMMER 3.0228, a BLAST-based annotation (using a non-redundant bacterial protein library), a tRNA and tmRNA sites localization for attachment sites recognition (tRNAscan-SE29 and ARAGORN30), a phage sequence identification (BLAST against a custom phage/prophage sequence database available at http://phast.wishartlab.com/Download.html) and a density calculation of gene clusters via DBSCAN.27 Only intact regions were analyzed in depth.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) were predicted with the CRISPRFinder web service.31 In this way, the highly conserved regions known as direct repeats (DR) (23–55 bp long) and spacers (0.6–2.5 the repeated length) were localized. Putative CRISPR cassettes having at least three motifs (DR + spacer) and a minimum of two identical DRs were considered as confirmed CRISPRs, while the remaining candidates were named as questionable. CRISPRFinder databases are available at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr/(Database status: Last update 2014-08-05).4.3. Genomic islandsIslandViewer 332 was used for the identification of genes of probable horizontal origin. For localizing genomic islands (GEIs) this tool integrates three different methods: IslandPath-DIMOB,33 SIGI-HMM34 and IslandPick.35 The first two predict GEIs considering the sequence composition, while the latter uses a comparative genomics approach.36,37 For further analysis, the islands predicted for at least one method that were completely included in a contig (in the case of draft genomes), were taken into account. Next, in order to find which GEIs are the same in different organisms we run Proteinortho (all vs all blastp of protein sequences encoded on each GEI) with default options but omitting the final clustering step (algebraic connectivity: 0, E-value = 1e-10). Based on the resulting graph, we extracted the pairwise amount of shared proteins for the respective GEIs and plotted them in a heatmap using the gplots R-package.31 Thereby predicted paralogs could be assigned to a single gene in another GEI (e.g. if one GEI has two paralogs that are orthologous to a gene in another GEI, then both have a partner in this GEI resulting in a similarity of 2/2 = 100% in one direction and 1/1 = 100% vice versa). All islands that did not share at least 50% of their proteins with any other island were removed as were pairs of GEIs with less than four proteins. For sake of simplicity, the names of species were cropped to the end of the strain name followed by the number of the strain-specific genomic island. Thus 19116-i1 means E. faecalis 19116 genomic island 1. All groups of homologous GEIs present in at least four strains were investigated in more detail.5. Results and discussion5.1. Overview of the enterococcal genomesWe investigated 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, that had a food related origin and/or probiotic properties. Among them, a total of 13 E. faecium, 5 E. faecalis, 3 E. mundtii and 1 E. durans, E. hirae, E. malodoratus as well as E. raffinosus strains were included. Based on available data they were next incorporated into four major groups: dairy isolates (11 strains isolated from cheese or milk environment), meat isolates (6 strains of meat origin), probiotics (7 strains known for their ability or potential to be used as probiotics) and dairy isolates and probiotics (2 strains which were probiotics and had a dairy origin as well). In order to avoid erroneous conclusions, the members of the latter group were dynamically assigned to either group dairy isolates or probiotics when comparing.General genomic features of all the strains analyzed in this study are provided in Table 1. No significant differences (P = 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis statistical test) were observed between the groups in terms of the average number of genes and proteins (RAST annotation as stated above), genome size and GC content. Genome sizes ranged from approximately 2.5–4.6 Mb and GC contents from 36.8 to 39.9%. In agreement with our results, genomic similarities were previously described among E. faecalis strains irrespective of geographical, host temporal or clinical/non-clinical origin of the isolates.38 Singularly, the number of protein encoding genes and ncRNAs detected in E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 (dairy origin) and E. raffinosus CFTRI 2200 (probiotic) draft genomes were the highest, and this was in accordance with their genome sizes that were about 1.6 Mb bigger than the average size of the genomes of the rest of the organisms under study. Interestingly, the strains with the highest GC% in each group were those with a higher number of coding DNA sequence (CDS) in the respective group (E. faecium E1613 for meat isolates). Relevant genomic features and isolation source of the enterococcal species under studyAll Accession numbers are from genbank.Genomes sizes were calculated as the total length of contigs for each genome.Relevant genomic features and isolation source of the enterococcal species under studyAll Accession numbers are from genbank.Genomes sizes were calculated as the total length of contigs for each genome.5.2. PhylogenyThe phylogenetic relationships of all strains were determined using two independent approaches. First, a genome based phylogenetic tree was built obtaining two main groups at species level (Fig. 1A). One of them, the most ancient, included the E. malodorous and E. raffinosus species represented by the strains E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 and E. raffinosus CFTRI 2200, respectively; and the other was comprised by the rest of the species under study: E. faecalis, E. mundtii, E. durans, E. hirae and E. faecium. In the latter group, E. faecalis formed a separate branch at the very beginning, and later in evolution, the same was observed first with E. mundtti and then with E. faecium. For their part, E. durans IPLA 655 and E. hirae INF E1 clustered together having with E. faecium the last common ancestor. This topology is in line with that of the 16S rRNA tree presented in Bergey’s manual.39 In the same way, the relationships observed when comparing a 1,102-bp fragment of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of ATP synthase atpA, from 91 Enterococcus strains, were in agreement with the phylogeny inferred from whole genomes in our study.40 According to Naser et al.40 this gene has an optimal discriminatory power that enables enterococcal species differentiation.

For details, see Materials and Methods.To provide an in-depth phylogenetic reconstruction we iterated the procedure at strain level. The E. faecium strains were separated into two major subgroups of which one also exhibited a more diverged subgroup comprising the two probiotic and very similar strains L-X and T-110. These results are in agreement with those reported by Palmer et al.41 which describe the E. faecium strains separation into two clades using orthologous groups but without including the two probiotic strains used here. In addition, non-clinical E. faecium strains clustered into two clades according to an analysis carried out by Kim et al.12In a second approach, we used protein sequences commonly shared in the species and strains under this study (Fig. 1B). Both analyses are in good agreement. However, in contrast to the genome based analysis, E. faecalis is reported as the most ancient branch of enterococci followed by the E. raffinosus and E. maloduratus cluster. As both trees branch with fairly high bootstrap values (0.96 and 0.86) a different evolutional pattern at nucleic and amino acid level can be assumed, leading to this result. Similarly, we find minor differences in the topology of the E. faecium group. We want to note that these findings were highly reproducible in all genome- and protein-based bootstrap runs. As for the genome-based tree, E. mundtti branched separately before E. faecium who shared it last ancestor with E. durans IPLA 655 and E. hirae INF E1.Both approaches led to the conclusion that non correlations between isolation source/probiotic properties and phylogenetic signal exist neither at species or strain levels. This indicates that niche specific adaptations do not affect the genome and proteome as a whole. In this direction, and analyzing strains of the same species individually, it was only seen that E. faecalis 2924 and 19116 from meat on the one hand, and the probiotic strains E. faecium L-X and E. faecium T-110, but not L-3, on the other hand, clustered together. We thus suppose adaptations to be located in the part of the proteome and genome that is not commonly shared among all strains of a certain species.5.3. Functional annotationAs a result of the functional annotation conducted with RAST it was possible to determine the features, assigned to subsystems that were (i) present in all organisms, (ii) related to the isolation source or strain property and (iii) species-specific (Fig. 2, Dataset 1). Among the strains of diary origin the average number of annotated protein encoding genes (PEGs) was 2,968; 2,739 for the meat isolates and 2,960 for the probiotics. In addition, it was seen that, for the former group, an average of 46.64% of the identified CDS were assigned to subsystems, 48.50% in case of the strains isolated from meat products and 49.29% for probiotics (Fig. 2A). Of those CDS assigned to subsystems, carbohydrates metabolism was the most enriched metabolic category. This is in accordance with the enterococcís ability to grow in different environments motivated by their capability of metabolizing at least 13 different kinds of sugar.42 Over 30 more can be utilized by at least two members of the genus. These carbohydrates sources are not limited to monomers, they are also usable as polymers.42 The second highest percentage of PEGs was in the protein metabolism category for E. faecium, E. hirae and E. mundtii, strains some of which share the dairy environment as source of isolation; meanwhile for E. malodoratus, E. raffinosus and E. faecalis species it was in the amino acids and derivatives category (Fig. 2B). In this regard, the Lactobacillus adaptation to the dairy niche has been associated with an increase in genes for peptide transport and hydrolysis.43Figure 2Open in new tabDownload slideCoding sequences dispensed in subsystems and their distribution in categories of metabolic function.

B) Distribution of metabolic functions in categories based on the subsystems features counts.None of the features of a certain functional role were exclusive of the members of one of the three major groups (dairy isolates, meat isolates, probiotics) under consideration (Dataset 1). This observation was valid when taking into account the 100, 60 and 40% of the members of each group for the respective comparison. However, it should be emphasized that 115 of a total of 254 subsystems analyzed were present in all the organisms and can thus be regarded as basic equipment of this genus. The number of CDS for the beta-glucoside metabolism was the most abundant in all groups (Dataset 1). Two beta-glucosides operons were present in all strains, the Bgl (beta-glucoside) and Cel (cellobiose) operons. The genes alsS and alsD of the alpha-acetolactate operon, encoding for the acetolactate synthase and alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, respectively, were also found in all the Enterococcus strains; both genes are involved in acetoin production from piruvate.32 Seventy-four out of the 115 subsystems were highly conserved as there was a difference of = 1 in the average number of features assigned to the strains of the different groups (Dataset 1). Interestingly, a higher number of genes of the beta-glucoside metabolism, lactose and galactose uptake and utilization, and fructose utilization subsystems were found, in most cases, in the dairy isolates and in probiotics; meanwhile, meat isolates had a greater abundance of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Dairy bacteria had, at the same time, on average more CDS related to chitin and N-acetylglucosamine utilization than the member of the other groups and probiotics, for their part, were in general more enriched in genes coding for the ABC transporter alkylphosphonate and the energy-coupling factor transporters.In parallel, an analysis aimed at evaluating the existence of species-specific genomic fingerprints sheds more conclusive results. Specifically, for those species that included more than one strain, it was seen that E. faecalis, for instance, had several features nucleated in subsystems of five different categories, some of them part of the lactate and ethanolamine utilization machinery. Ethanolamine utilization is considered a survival advantage for bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract and was also related to pathogens virulence.44E. faecium strains had, on the other hand, genes for the late competence event, fundamental for exogenous DNA acquisition, not localized in any other species; and E. mundtii strains had CDS of the carotenoids subsystem, responsible of their particular color, and one gene encoding a NG, NG-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1.5.4. Niche-specific proteins and core proteomeWe used the RAST annotation to determine genes of certain classes that could be located in a niche specific pattern and that were present in all species, irrespective of their origin (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S1, Data set 2). The least specific group in this regard was represented by the strains isolated from meat (all belonging to E. faecium or E. faecalis). This group exclusively exhibited the protein IbrB, a co-activator of gene expression which is most likely derived from prophage, and a methyltransferase that modifies adenine bases of the 18S rRNA (in eukaryotes). Both genes must thus be results of horizontal gene transfer related to the environment. On the other hand, most genes specific to dairy and probiotic strains were hypothetical proteins. In the dairy group, these were most pronounced as homologs were located in strains of four different species. Among others, this included an E. faecium strain, a species that is otherwise present in all three groups (dairy, meat, probiotics), indicating these hypothetical proteins to be highly niche specific adaptations, however, of unknown function. Interestingly, one of the niche-specific genes codes for a membrane transport protein that passively transfer molecules or ions through the cell membrane and could thus be related to the peculiarities of the dairy environment. For probiotic strains we have additionally located a putative DNA methyltransferase. Homologs are mainly known from the Haemophilus genus.45Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideVenn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideVenn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Venn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Venn diagram showing i) the number of unique FIGfam protein classes that were present in at least 40% of the strains and in at least two different species of the respective group but in no species/strain of any other group (unique), ii) the number of classes that were similarly present in two or more groups (overlapped), iii) the number of protein classes that were similarly present in all groups (in the center of the diagram), and iv) the subset of classes that were found to be present in all groups and in at least four different Enterococci species rather than two (indicated in parentheses).Looking at the overlap of shared genes, the meat and probiotic group had the least in common. Above of a phage lysin found in both groups, the fumarate reductase probably represented a true functional finding. Fumaric acid is a food additive used for antimicrobial preservation of meat to reduce the spread of pathogens.46 With respect to this background, it is reasonable to conclude that the respective strains from the group are able to degrade this acid in their habitat (meat isolates). Probiotic strains, on the other hand, might be in contact with fumaric acid in the gastrointestinal habitat, while it does not play a role for strains from the dairy group.The overlap of the dairy and the probiotic groups can also be seen as set of genes that were not present in the meat group. It contained three phosphonate ABC transporter proteins, all found linked in the same strains, indicating that phosphonates play an important role here but not in meat related environments. In addition two proteins related to galactoside metabolism were located. Both were reported with an E-value slightly above the 0.05 significance threshold (0.076). Again, this energy-source is obviously not important for meat related strains. Alongside with galactoside related proteins, a not further specifiable membrane transporter was identified to be present. Similarly the alpha-glycosyltransferase was found solely in the dairy and probiotic groups.With 15 shared proteins, the overlap of the meat and the dairy group seems rather large. Most of them, however, were related to phages (six) or were hypothetical proteins (five) often exhibiting weaker E-values closer to or slightly above 0.05. The remaining specific proteins were the ATP-binding protein p271, an ATPase component of an uncharacterized ABC-type transport system and, most interestingly a probable extracellular solute-binding protein that was present in the same strains as an arabinofuranosidase. Both might thus be related, indicating that arabinose might not be as relevant for probiotic strains.Finally, we determined the core proteome of all enterococci used in this study by asking which genes were present in 40% of all strains in all groups (see Materials and Methods). As a result, 1617 FIGfam families were located to be universally present. Out of them 1457 were found to be present in at least four different enterococci species. A detailed list can be found in Supplementary Table S1.6. Genomic features among food-related and probiotic enterococcal strains6.1. BacteriocinsGenes encoding bacteriocins are widely disseminated among enterococci from different origins.47 For probiotic bacteria, the ability to successfully outcompete undesired species is often due to, or enhanced by, the production of bacteriocins.48 With this background, a search for genes related to bacteriocins was carried out through BAGEL 3 and BLAST (Table 2). Number of antibiotic resistance and bacteriocin genes in the enterococcal genomesARG: antibiotic resistance gene; AGly: aminoglycosides; Gly: glycopeptides; MLS: macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin; Tet: tetracyclines; Tmt: trimethoprim.Number of antibiotic resistance and bacteriocin genes in the enterococcal genomesARG: antibiotic resistance gene; AGly: aminoglycosides; Gly: glycopeptides; MLS: macrolide-lincosamidestreptogramin; Tet: tetracyclines; Tmt: trimethoprim.Of all species under examination, E. faecium was the one that harbored the larger number of bacteriocin genes in general, being the meat isolate E. faecium UC8733 the strain with the highest bacteriocinogenic potential with eight genes encoding for class II and two for class III bacteriocins. Reinforcing the idea, in previous studies we could identify six class II bacteriocin gene clusters in E. faecium CRL 187949 coincident with those found in NRRL B-2354, also of dairy origin. Moreover, and in agreement with our previous findings related to non-clinical and clinical E. faecium47, no correlations between the presence of enterocin structural genes and strains origin were observed in the present analysis. Özdemir et al.50 also described the same phenomenon among enterococcal species isolated from different origins (including river, treatment plant, spring and garbage water, soil, animal and vegetables).Enterocins A and B were always considered as hallmark of this genus. However, as we have shown previously, not all strains carrying enterocin A genes (entA) also harbor a enterocin B gene (entB).49 The first one (entA) was detected in CRL 1879, NRRL B-2354, UC8733, L-3, L-X and UC10237, all belonging to the E. faecium species. Surprisingly, the class III bacteriocin enterolysin A, a bacteriolysin, first characterized in E. faecalis, was not found in all strains belonging to this species. However, this gene was present in all E. faecium belonging to the three different groups (dairy isolates, meat isolates and probiotics) except in E. faecium UC10237 (Supplementary Table S2). Meanwhile, E. faecium E1613 (meat isolate) was the only with a CDS for Subtilosin A. As previously described51,52,E. mundtii CRL35 and E. mundtii CRL1656 (diary isolates) have the CDS for Enterocin CRL35 and Mundticin CRL1656, respectively. According to BAGEL, these were the only bacteriocin encoding genes that they carried within their genome (Supplementary Table S2). Regarding E. faecalis, the strains 19,116 and MB5259 (meat and dairy/probiotics, respectively) were the only harboring genes encoding for Cytolysin structural subunits CylLS and CylLL (Supplementary Table S2). In animal models of enterococcal infections it was observed that Cytolysin contributes to virulence,53 rendering this strain potentially pathogenic. Finally, no CDS related to bacteriocin production were found in the genomes of E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 (incomplete genome) and E. faecalis Symbioflor 1 (complete genome).6.2. Antibiotic resistance genesEnterococci have been defined as increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics in recent years.54 They have an intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics and can also acquire resistance to many others, including those of clinical use. E. faecium and E. faecalis are the most successful strains evolving as multi-resistant pathogens because of their ability to acquire and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes, encoded by mobile genetic elements.55 In this study, genes that conferred resistances to glycopeptides, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, tetracyclines and trimethoprim were detected. The in silico prediction of antibiotic resistance genes revealed that E. faecalis 2924, isolated from turkey meat in 2005, was the only strain carrying genes involved in vancomycin resistance, which is of high clinical importance. At the same time, this was the strain with the highest number of antibiotic resistance genes (14 protein-coding genes, see Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3). This finding is in line with the idea that the increased use of antibiotics in healthcare and animal husbandry is linked with the emergence, spreading and persistence of resistant strains in animal products.56 For example, some enterococci isolated from Portuguese traditional fermented meat products were resistant to erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin and tetracycline, but in this case none was to vancomycin.57 With ten resistance genes E. faecalis 19116 was the second in abundance (Table 2). In contrast, strains belonging to E. mundtii, E. durans and E. maloduratus species did not contain antibiotic resistance related CDS at all (Table 3). Remarkably, all of them were isolated from dairy origin indicating that at least in some instance, antibiotic resistances are of minor relevance in dairy environment compared to the other groups where no strain investigated completely lacks antibiotic resistance genes.

The aac(6')-Ii gene, is species-specific and encodes for a chromosomal aminoglycoside acetyltransferase specific for E. faecium strains.58 The 6'-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferases [AAC (6')s] are of particular interest because they can modify a number of clinically important aminoglycosides and some of them are often present in integrons, transposons, plasmids, genomic islands and other genetic structures. AAC (6')-I-type enzymes effectively acetylate amikacin but not gentamicin. To date 45 such genes have been characterized.59 On the other hand, msrC encodes a putative efflux pump of the ABC transporter family and it seems that the presence of this gene confers an advantage for the members of this species.58 Similarly, the genes lsaA and mphD were found exclusively in the E. faecalis strains (Supplementary Table S3). Lsa gene, encodes a putative ABC protein that confers resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and clindamycin60 and is located in the chromosome. The gen mphD codes for a phosphorylase and belongs to the group of inactivating enzymes61 (Supplementary Table S3). The meat isolate E. faecium UC7251, unlike the other strains of this species, additionally had genes for resistance to antibiotics of the tetracyclines class, apart from the MLS resistance genes ermB and lnuB, and aminoglycosides resistance genes aph3-III and sat4A (Supplementary Table S3).6.3. Prophage sequences and CRISPRs—Cas systemsLysogenic phages are an important source of information related to bacterial pathogenesis.62 Comparative genomic analysis evidenced that polylysogeny is a common phenomenon in the Enterococcus genus.62 Particularly, in E. faecalis V583 temperate phages constitute the main source of horizontally acquired DNA representing nearly 10% the size of the genome.62Within the scope of this study we search for prophage-like sequences in the genomes. In this sense, as a result of the analysis performed with PHAST, we evidenced in all strains but E. mundtii CRL1656, E. malodoratus ATCC 43197 and E. faecium L-3, several intact regions related to different prophages associated with the Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Listeria, Bacillus, among other genera (Table 3). The temperate bacteriophages EFC-1 and PhiEf11, originally described in E. faecalis, had the highest number of CDS. PhiEf11 contained 63 from a total of 68 phage CDS in the probiotic strain MB5259, and EFC-1 38 CDS from a total of 72 in the meat isolate 19116. At the same time, the fEf11 phage was present in organisms belonging to four different species: E. durans IPLA 655, E. faecalis MB5259, E. mundtii CRL35, E. faecalis Symbioflor 1, E. faecium L-X and E. faecium T-110. Additionally, E. faecalis MB5259, a strain with probiotic properties and a dairy origin had a total of five intact phage related regions with CDS from different phages (Table 3).It is interesting to note that all strains from meat origin harbored only one intact prophage region and that E. faecium UC7251 contained the largest intact phage-related region (70.1 kb) with the bacteriophage Lister 2389, isolated from Listeria monocytogenes strain Scott A,63 having 16 from a total of 64 CDS located in that region. In E. faecalis 2924 and PC1.1 another Listeria phage, LP-101, was located. Interestingly, this phage was first obtained from silage samples collected on a dairy farm.64 Then Listeria phage B025 related coding sequences were localized on the intact region of E. faecium UC10237 (Table 3). Bacillus phage BCJA1c had the highest protein counts in UC7267, ATCC-882, CRL35 and L-X, but none in those meat related strains and Lactococcus phages related proteins were the most abundant in E. mundtii CRL35 and E. faecium L-X intact phage regions (Table 3).Related to the acquisition of phages and other mobile elements, enterococci that possess CRISPR-Cas systems, are less likely to acquire phages and other mobile elements.65 We found that E. raffinosus CFTRI 2200, with four individual gene cassettes, was the strain with the highest number of these prokaryotic immune systems among all under evaluation (Table 4). At the same time, one of these four CRISPRs, with a size of 1215 bp, was the largest identified. E. faecium UC7256 and E. hirae INF E1, both dairy isolates, had two confirmed CRISPRS systems each. Regarding meat isolates, E. faecalis 2924, E. faecium E1613 and E. faecium UC7251, had confirmed clusters with five, three and three spacers, respectively. All members of the probiotics group but E. faecium T-110 had confirmed CRISPR systems (Table 4). Among the confirmed CRISPR systems of all organisms DR sizes ranged from 23 to 37 bp and the number of spacers from 3 to 18.

These are characterized by abundant mobile DNA, including phages, plasmids and transposons that carries multiple antibiotic resistances. Palmer et al. found that antibiotic resistance and possession of complete CRISPR loci are inversely related and that members of recently emerged high-risk enterococcal lineages lack complete CRISPR loci suggesting that antibiotic therapy inadvertently selects for enterococci with compromised genome defense.65 However, we cannot confirm these findings with our results regarding food-related strains. Especially for dairy isolates we frequently found no confirmed CRISPR system but also no antibiotic resistance genes (IPLA 655, ATCC 43197, ATCC 882, CRL1656). Vice versa the probiotic isolate CFTRI 2200 was heavily armed both with four confirmed CRISPR systems and at least four antibiotic resistance genes (see Tables 2 and 4), observations that are opposite to the findings described for the strains of clinical relevance.Interestingly, the analysis of the gene context of all confirmed CRISPR systems identified by CRISPRFinder evidenced the existence of CRISPR associated genes (cas) upstream the CRISPR cassette only in INF E1 (confirmed CRISPR #2) and CFTRI 2200 (confirmed CRISPR #3). The former has genes exclusive of a Type II CRISPR-Cas system subtype II-A, while the latter related to a Type I CRISPR-Cas system subtype I-B.66,67 These results suggest that the systems detected in the other strains might not be functional or their specific cas related genes are located further than 2000bp upstream or downstream the CRISPR cassette.On the other hand, No confirmed CRISPR system was detected in CRL1879, NRRL B-2354, UC7267, 19116, UC8733 and UC10237 strains.6.4. Genomic islandsHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the phenomena responsible of the diversification and adaptation of microorganisms, and has a direct impact on the genome plasticity and size; it is believed that the majority of the HGT has been facilitated by genomic islands (GEIs).68 In this respect, a detailed analysis of the enterococcal genomes allowed us to identify many GEIs and to correlate them according to the similarity of the encoded CDS (Fig. 4). From the GEI detected, all groups found in at least five different strains were further evaluated. With the exception of the GEI number 5, all four remaining islands were E. faecium-related to the major extend. A correlation with respect to the isolation origin cannot be observed nor can an exclusive occurrence in strains of a certain species (Supplementary Table S4).

Dark colour indicates nearly perfect overlaps while white means no detectable relation at all. GEIs play a crucial role in dissemination of variable genes, such us antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, and can contribute to the generation of the currently well-known named hospital ‘superbugs’. However, none of the five GEIs here evaluated contains CDS related to known pathogenic markers of clinical relevant enterococcal species. With 33 to 36 CDS GEI 1 (Supplementary Table S4a) was the biggest island containing mainly ribosomal proteins and translation factors along with accessory proteins for transcription and translation and protein secretion (e.g. RNA polymerase, Preprotein translocase secY).In agreement with one of the ideas that considers GEIs an overarching family of elements, as is the case of mobile DNA elements constituted by integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), conjugative transposons and some prophages, we found for instance integrases in GEI 2 (XerD, Supplementary Table S4b) and GEI 5 (Supplementary Table S4e) and phage-related proteins in GEI 4 (Supplementary Table S4d). It has been previously described that the coding capacity of GEIs is not limited to pathogenicity functions and can be very diverse including such traits as symbiosis, sucrose and aromatic compound metabolism, mercury resistance and siderophore synthesis.69,70 Thereof especially GEIs 2 and 3 (Supplementary Table S4b and c) encoded some interesting CDS. Among others, some examples were the ferric uptake regulation protein (oxidative stress), an enolase (pyruvate metabolism) and a triosephosphate isomerase (sugar metabolism). Finally, the third group of genes was that of hypothetical proteins with unknown function which was highly abundant in GEI 4 and 5 (Supplementary Table S4d and e) rendering any interpretation futile.7. ConclusionIn this work we performed a detailed comparative analysis of food-related and probiotic enterococcal genomes. As previously demonstrated by our group, bacteriocin genes were widely distributed among E. faecium strains. Interestingly, antibiotic resistance genes were predominant in those organisms of meat origin coincidentally with the notion of the unrestricted use of antibiotics in husbandry. A search for regions enriched in phage related coding sequences evidenced that they were extensively propagated throughout the genus. In dairy isolates, phages derived from bacteria commonly associated to the milk environment, such us Listeria, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. Interestingly, only two strains carried a complete CRISPR-Cas system (CFTRI 2200 and INF E1) but potential orphan cassettes were localized in the rest of the species. Importantly, five GEIs were found to be the same in different organisms and none of them contained CDS related with known pathogenic markers of clinical relevant enterococcus species.Our in-depth phylogenetic reconstruction yielded that strains form clusters in accordance to their species but not to their isolation origin or probiotic properties. While we determined a set of 1617 FIGfam families as core proteome universally present among the genera, we were also able to identify several proteins that seem to occur in a strain-overarching but niche-specific pattern. Besides some phage-related regions/genes that seemingly occur in a habitat-dependent fashion, there was a specific membrane transport protein found exclusively in dairy isolates. Moreover, our data indicated that only dairy isolates could be found without any antibiotic resistance genes. All strains from the other groups code for at least one such gene. On the other hand, all dairy isolates were missing a gene coding for fumarate reductase generally present in meat isolates and probiotics. Enterococci isolated from meat origins lacked three phosphonate ABC transporters and two proteins related to galactoside metabolism that were otherwise found in most dairy isolates and probiotics. Moreover, arabinose-related proteins were missing from probiotics. Finally, we located a number of additional niche-specific but hypothetical proteins, a finding that might nevertheless aid in their future functional characterization. In principal, any of these specific genes could be used as indicator for the original habitat of a species making it possible to trace e.g. the origin of a strain that developed pathogenicity.Based on the above described we can suggest that dairy isolates have greater potential than meat isolates for use as probiotics, at least at the genomic level, and their formal application in the future will require deep analysis including biochemical tests and in vitro as well as in vivo experiments.Other than that, we also observed niche-specific features at species level. For instance, the antibiotic resistance genes lsaA and mphD were found exclusively in the E. faecalis strains that belonged to the probiotics and meat isolates groups but not in those isolated from dairy. Also, only Enterococcus faecalis strains from meat origin and probiotics had a set of genes for ethanolamine utilization.Regarding the data, parallel evolution via horizontal gene transfer seems a likely cause for many specific genes reported here. We assume that most were acquired after speciation due to similar environments. This is certainly true for phage-related genes, likely being a result of the environment rather than a prerequisite. Also a number of specific genes were only present in less than half of all representatives of a niche and most were located mainly in E. faecalis and E. faecium strains specific to a certain niche (see Table 2). With respect to the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) one would expect them to occur in some species in between as well if they were already present in a common ancestor. There are, however, notable exceptions. Specific genes present in five or even six of the seven enterococci species under this study that occur in a niche-specific manner were likely present in the common ancestor and probably got lost in strains that did not gain advantage of them anymore due to specialization, e.g. to a different niche or habitat. Here we especially refer to the phosphonate ABC transporters and the genes related to galactoside metabolism.Altogether, our data demonstrated that while a few niche-specific genomic features of enterococci can be identified, relevant genomic idiosyncrasies mainly depend on the species in the first place rather than a specific niche or habitat.This study was carried out with the financial support from CONICET (PIP0406/12) and MinCyT (PICT2011 N°0175) from Argentina.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

Identification of promoters associated with different transcripts is necessary for characterization of the transcriptome. Promoter regions have been shown to have unique structural features as compared with their flanking region, in organisms covering all domains of life. Here we report an in silico analysis of DNA sequence dependent structural properties like stability, bendability and curvature in the promoter region of six different prokaryotic transcriptomes. Using these structural features, we predicted promoters associated with different categories of transcripts (mRNA, internal, antisense and non-coding), which constitute the transcriptome. Promoter annotation using structural features is fairly accurate and reliable with about 50% of the primary promoters being characterized by all three structural properties while at least one property identifies 95%. We also studied the relative differences of these structural features in terms of gene expression and found that the features, viz. lower stability, lesser bendability and higher curvature are more prominent in the promoter regions which are associated with high gene expression as compared with low expression genes. Hence, promoters, which are associated with higher gene expression, get annotated well using DNA structural features as compared with those, which are linked to lower gene expression.1. IntroductionAdvances in genome sequencing technology have resulted in a large amount of raw data in the form of whole genome sequences of organisms. This sequence data needs to be annotated, viz. identification of coding regions, non-coding regions and regulatory elements. Computational tools are the only viable option for fast and fairly reliable annotation of many genome sequences. Promoter prediction is an important step in the genome annotation process; not only for the validation of the predicted genes but also for the identification of novel genes, especially those associated with non-coding RNA, which are often missed by gene prediction programs. Identification of transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) and promoters is essential for understanding transcription and regulation of the genes. Regulatory regions that affect the transcription initiation process are beyond the target DNA sequence motifs.1–4 There are studies in which DNA structural features are integrated with motif search algorithms to identify TFBSs5,6. DNA shape determined by four distinct features—Minor groove width, Propeller twist, Roll and Helix twist has been found to be an important determinant in the identification of TFBSs and transcription start sites (TSSs).7–9 Physico-chemical properties of DNA double helix such as hydrogen bonding, stacking energy etc. show DNA sequence functional density signatures.10–12 Promoter regions have been found to be associated with some unique structural features (like low stability, lesser bendability and more curvature etc.) across organisms.13–16 Promoter annotation based on the relative stability of DNA duplex has been found to be more reliable and accurate for a wide range of prokaryotes, compared with sequence based approaches.17,18 PromBase is a comprehensive database which provides promoter predictions, based on relative stability, for whole genome sequences of bacteria and archaea with respect to their Translation Start Sites.19 Profiles of some other structural properties, such as bendability and curvature are also displayed in addition to stability. A previous study has shown that different categories of promoters (primary, secondary and internal promoters) display a gradation in their sequence dependent structural properties and which is mostly conserved for orthologous genes in ten strains of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.20 Non-B DNA structural motifs are preferentially located in the regulatory regions of operons in E. coli.21The recent study in Mycoplasma pneumonia shows that free energy of promoter region is an important determinant in the identification of true promoter from abortive and non promoters, apart from sequence elements such as -10, extended -10 and -35 box.22Whole genome transcriptome studies reveal the pervasive nature of transcription and suggest that transcription is not restricted to regions upstream of the annotated coding sequences (CDSs) but can initiate from almost any genomic location.23 The wide variety of transcripts like mRNA, internal, antisense and non-coding RNA have been found to exist in the prokaryotic genome. Large fractions of these non-coding RNAs are found to be functional and are involved in various regulatory activities in the cell.24 Antisense transcripts play an important role in gene regulatory networks and constitute a secondary layer of regulatory switch, which has great potential in genetic engineering.25,26 Hence, annotation of non-coding transcripts is crucial for a complete understanding of functional genomics and gene regulatory circuits.26,27 To address these issues, we have studied structural properties of the promoter regions in different categories of transcripts characterized in the transcriptome of six different model organisms, viz. H. pylori, Anabaena, Synechocystis, E. coli, Salmonella and Klebsiella. The genomic GC content for these organisms varies from 39% for H. pylori to 57% for Klebsiella (Table 1). We used the differences in these properties between promoter regions and the flanking sequences to predict promoters associated with the different categories of transcripts such as primary, internal, antisense and non-coding RNA. Ability to predict the strength of a promoter is the next challenge in promoter annotation process. Sequence motif based approaches have been reported for E. coli, which predict the strength of the promoter moderately well in an organism specific manner.28–30 DNA thermodynamics and supercoiling dynamics have been found to be associated with gene expression during different bacterial growth cycle.31,32 Following this up, we have analysed the relationship between DNA structural features and the strength of the promoter, in terms of gene expression in six different model organisms.  Genomic features and number of TSSs of various categories in six different model organisms used in this studyAbbreviations used: gTSS, primary TSS; iTSS, internal TSS; aTSS, antisense TSS; nTSS, non-coding TSS. Genomic features and number of TSSs of various categories in six different model organisms used in this studyAbbreviations used: gTSS, primary TSS; iTSS, internal TSS; aTSS, antisense TSS; nTSS, non-coding TSS.2. Material and methods2.1. Promoter sequence dataset preparationTSS information of H.pylori strain 2669533 (H.pylori), Anabaena sp. PCC712034 (Anabaena), Synechocystis sp. PCC 680335 (Synechocystis), E.coli K-12 MG165536 (E. coli), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium37 (Salmonella) and Klebsiella pneumoniae36 (Klebsiella) was obtained from the relevant published data. For each gene (protein/RNA), TSS with highest number of reads was selected for creating a unique dataset of primary/gTSS (transcribing mRNA), iTSS (TSSs present inside the gene), aTSS (corresponding to antisense transcripts, encompassed within the gene), whereas all available nTSS (non-coding transcripts) were taken (Table 1). Only those categories of TSSs, that had more than 100 TSSs, were selected for the study. Whole genome sequence and translation start site (TLS) information were downloaded from ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/) of NCBI. Genome sequences of 1001 nucleotides length (spanning 500 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the TSS positioned at 0) were extracted from the whole genome sequence using TSS information as provided in published data.Non-promoter sequence or negative dataset was created, by taking the CDS of the genes associated with gTSS (primary TSS).2.2. Estimation of structural properties of promoter sequencesWe have studied three sequence dependent structural properties stability, bendability and curvature. Stability of a piece of double stranded DNA sequence molecule can be calculated in terms of the free energy of its constituent dinucleotides. The free energy values of the 10 unique dinucleotides were taken from data based on melting studies of oligo and polynucleotides.38 Stability profile of 1001 nucleotides long promoter sequence was calculated by dividing each sequence in sliding windows of 15 base pairs each (or 14 dinucleotide steps) using the free energy values for the constituent dinucleotides. Average free energy (AFE) (in kcal/mol) was calculated at each nucleotide position after aligning all TSS at 0 position.39Bendability of promoter sequences was calculated by using two different trinucleotide models, DNase I sensitivity40 (DNase I) and nucleosomal positioning preference (NPP).41 Bendability profile was calculated using a 30 nucleotides window size.Curvature of promoter sequence was estimated by the calculated value of d/lmax (the ratio of minimum end to end distance ‘d’ to the length of a DNA fragment ‘lmax’)42 for the models generated using a set of dinucleotide values obtained from gel retardation mobility assay of multiple polymeric DNA sequences (BMHT).43 The DNA models were generated using 75 nucleotides window size and d/lmax vale was calculated by using in-house program NUCGEN.44 Values of d/lmax ranges from 0 (completely closed circle indicating high curvature) to 1 (perfectly linear DNA).2.3. Promoter prediction methodologyPromoter sequences of 1001 nucleotide length from six different bacteria were categorized on the basis of their GC composition (at 5% GC intervals). Sequence information was translated to numerical information in terms of structural properties mentioned above. The training set of promoter sequences were selected from the primary TSS promoters, associated with gTSS. A 5-fold analysis was performed, by selecting 80% as training dataset and it was applied on full dataset. Two independent cycles of cutoff derivation and promoter predictions were performed using 75 and 100 nucleotide long windows, respectively, for all given structural features.The more prominent low stability peak was observed in the vicinity of TSS across all bacterium species. Hence, the region -55 to + 20 (with respect to TSS) was selected to derive one of the cutoff values (STB1) for the first cycle while -80 to + 20 region was taken for the second cycle. Promoters were predicted by comparing structural properties of neighboring regions; hence a 75 nucleotides window from +200 to + 275 with respect to TSSs and 100 nucleotides window from +200 to + 300 with respect to TSSs were chosen to derive second cutoff value (STB2) for stability for cycle one and cycle two respectively. Less bendability and high curvature span were observed in the upstream regions of TSSs across all the organisms. Hence -100 to -25 and -125 to -25 nucleotides with respect to TSSs were considered for derivation of first cutoff values for bendability (both models BDC1 and BNC1) and curvature (CBC1), for the first and second cycle of predictions respectively. Similarly, the second set of cutoff values for bendability (BDC2 and BNC2) and curvature (CBC2) were derived from +200 to + 275 and +200 to + 300 nucleotides with respect to TSSs for the first and second cycle of predictions, respectively.The cutoff values derived at 5%GC interval for all DNA sequence dependent structural properties were applied within -200 to + 100 nucleotide region (R1) and +200 to + 500 nucleotide region (R2) with respect to TSS in the full dataset. A given sequence was identified as a promoter sequence if a particular sequence dependent structural property was found to be present and satisfies the following set of conditions. R1 = STB1 & R2 = STB2 for stabilityR1= BDC1 & R2 = BDC2 for bendability (DNase I)R1 = BNC1 & R2 = BNC2 for bendability (NPP)R1 = CBC1 & R2 = CBC2 for curvatureSequences satisfying the above conditions were assigned as true positive (TP) for the representative feature, else they were classified as false negative (FN). In the negative dataset, +200 to + 500 nucleotide region was scanned for conditions mentioned earlier. If a sequence from negative dataset was found to satisfy above criteria then it was designated as false positive (FP) for the respective property, else it was tagged as true negative (TN).TP and TN rates were defined by calculating sensitivity (also known as recall) and specificity respectively, to measure the performance of binary classification test. Fidelity of the search was determined by calculating precision. Evaluation of classifier was done, by calculating balanced–accuracy and F-score, which are arithmetic and harmonic means of sensitivity and precision respectively.2.4. Gene expression estimationMicroarray expression profiling data (RNA sample from wild type) H. pylori (GSM931753), Synechocystis (GSM1316725), E. coli (GSM1374996), Salmonella (GSM1102757) and Klebsiella (GSM877524) was downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), NCBI.45. Differential expression was calculated by using DESeq (R/Bioconductor package)46 to measure the change in the expression fold in the absence of Nitrogen from transcriptome data.34 Primary TSSs (gTSS) were sorted in descending order (in the terms of their expression level) and top 10 percentile were considered as high expression genes expected to be associated with strong promoters. The bottom 10 percentile was taken as a dataset for low expression genes with weak promoters. Structural features were calculated for the sequences extracted using TSS location and strand information from the whole genome sequence.2.5. Statistical methodsStatistical significance of structural properties enrichment in the promoter regions of highly expressed genes as compared with lowly expressed genes were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test). One-sided two-sample KS test was performed to test the significance of the difference in feature value between the two classes (here null hypothesis was that the both datasets have similar CDF distribution). Null hypothesis was rejected at the significance level of 1%. MATLAB was used for statistical analysis.3. Results and discussion3.1 Promoter regions corresponding to prokaryotic transcriptomes show distinct structural propertiesWe have characterized DNA duplex stability (AFE), bendability using two different models DNase I sensitivity (DNase I) and NPP and intrinsic curvature in the promoter region of different categories of TSSs in six different model organisms. DNase I sensitivity model gives the bending propensity of each trinucleotide in terms of bending towards major groove while NPP model gives the rotational preference of each trinucleotide towards histone core. The DNA structural profiles show that promoter (primary) regions are in general less stable, less bendable and more curved as compared to neighboring regions (Fig. 1). DNA duplex stability, expressed in the terms of AFE (kcal/mol) profile, shows a low stability peak in the vicinity of the TSS across organisms with varying genomic GC content. With increase in genomic GC% from H. pylori with 39% to Klebsiella with 57% the baseline shifts to higher stability (lower AFE) values, while the low stability peak splits. The secondary low stability peak is likely to be associated with -35 element. Bendability profiles as calculated using two different trinucleotide models (DNase I and NPP), show similar low bendability peaks in the region upstream of the TSS. Curvature profile shows that the promoter region is more intrinsically curved as compared with flanking regions.

The number of promoter sequences and whole genome GC% is mentioned along with the organism name, on the left of each row.The shuffled promoter sequences obtained by the randomization of native promoter sequences do not show these properties, even when they were estimated separately for three different regions: upstream (-500 to -100 nucleotide), promoter region (-80 to +20 nucleotide) and downstream region (+100 to +500) nucleotide with respect to TSS at 0 position in order to retain the GC composition of these regions. Interestingly genomic sequences in the promoter, as well as the non-promoter region, are overall less bendable and more curved than the shuffled sequences. On the other hand, while genomic promoter sequences are less stable than their shuffled counterparts, the flanking genomic sequences are more stable. The loss of special structural features in shuffled sequences suggests that these features arise due to specific base sequence patterns.Similar structural profiles were observed for internal promoters, antisense promoters and non-coding RNA gene promoters (Fig. 2). Stability profiles show sharp low stability peaks in the case of internal, antisense and non-coding RNA promoters as compared with primary promoters across all organisms. Bendability and curvature profiles also show distinct features in their promoter regions, but they are less prominent for these categories of promoters as compared with primary promoters. Base composition analysis shows that primary category of promoters (-100 to 0 nucleotide with respect to TSS at 0) show preference for several AT rich tetramers as compared with background region (-500 to +500 nucleotide with respect to TSS at 0) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Internal and antisense categories of promoters show less preference for AT rich tetramers and TATA sequence motifs as compared with primary and non-coding RNA promoters. Core promoter region (-35 and -10 element) shows poor sequence conservation even for promoters associated with primary category of TSSs (Supplementary Fig. S2) and becomes poorer for internal and antisense categories of promoters as compared with the primary category across the six different model organisms with varying genomic GC content. Interestingly no sequence motif signature was observed in their -35 region, while a secondary low stability peak was observed in the same region for primary category of TSSs across the organisms. The weak preference for AT rich tetramers and poor sequence motif conservation in core promoter elements (-35 and -10 elements) makes it difficult to predict these promoters by sequence motif based approaches.

Two cycles of predictions were performed using 75 and 100 nucleotides window size (using two different sets of cut-off values derived using 75 and 100 nucleotides fragment length for cycle one and two, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity achieved in each cycle, using the four different properties are shown in Figure 3 for all six organisms. Higher specificity was achieved at the cost of sensitivity in the second cycle of prediction, which uses larger fragment length of DNA sequence and most importantly, it was found to be valid for all structural features in primary category of promoters. Bendability (DNase I sensitivity model) and curvature were found to be equally sensitive but less specific in nature as compared with stability in all six model organisms.

Similarly, bendability (both models DNase I sensitivity and NPP) and curvature features were found to give high precision values in cycle two as compared with cycle one. Both prediction cycles were found to give an almost similar balanced-accuracy (BA), which is the mean of TP rate (sensitivity) and TN rate (specificity). Overall cycle one was found to be a better predictor, with better F-score (harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision) values across all the model organisms for all structural features.  Assessment of DNA structural features for their ability to differentiate between promoter and non-promoter sequences in six different model organismsOut of the total test dataset (promoters associated with the primary category of TSS), 1001 nucleotide long sequences with 30–65% GC content were considered. The sequences with promoter predictions falling in the 300 nucleotide region spanning -200 to +100 with respect to TSS at 0 were considered as TP while sequences with predictions falling in the coding region +200 to + 500 with respect to TSS were labelled as FP. Evaluation parameters precision (Prec.), BA and F-score were calculated using formulas explained in the ‘Material and methods’ section.

Evaluation parameters precision (Prec.), BA and F-score were calculated using formulas explained in the ‘Material and methods’ section.We categorized the predicted promoters based on the function performed by the associated gene, according to the Cluster of Orthologous Groups information obtained from NCBI (Supplementary Table S1). Promoters associated with genes involved in information storage and processing function (transcription, translation and replication), which are constitutively expressed in the cell are annotated well across the six different organisms. However, sensitivity values for an individual structural feature vary among the organisms, e.g. promoters associated with genes which have a role in replication and repair exhibit sensitivity values (using stability) ranging from a low of 38% for Synechocystis to a high of 72% for Klebsiella. Promoters of genes involved in cellular processing and cell signaling are relatively less well annotated. Genes involved in metabolism function show variation in the sensitivity values for different gene families. General function genes (which are based on prediction only) also get annotated reliably in all six prokaryotic organisms. Genes which are not characterized or with unknown function are found to be relatively less annotated in all organisms. Hence, prediction results suggest that structural features in the promoter regions are related to the function associated with the gene.Internal, antisense and non-coding RNA promoters were also predicted using the cut-off values derived from primary promoter sequences. Higher sensitivity values were obtained in the first cycle of prediction as compared with the second cycle. Bendability (both by DNase I sensitivity and NPP model) and curvature were found to be more sensitive for these categories of promoters, as compared with stability. The reduction in the sensitivity values for stability feature for internal and antisense promoters was due to sharp and narrow low stability peak in the AFE profile (Fig. 2). The narrower peaks can be attributed to these categories of promoters being present within the coding region while primary promoters are mostly present in the relatively AT rich intergenic region upstream of TSS.3.3 Promoter annotation using combination of structural featuresAlthough stability was found to be the most distinctive feature, differentiating the promoter from the flanking region for a given genomic sequence, it was able to achieve maximum 81% sensitivity for primary category of promoters in Klebsiella, in cycle one prediction (Fig. 3). In order to assess the number of promoter sequences that do not get identified by any structural feature, we applied a combinatorial approach. It was found that ˜95% primary category of promoter sequences get identified by at least one structural feature. Similar sensitivity values are obtained from a combinatorial approach using DNase I sensitivity and NPP models for bendability (as seen in Fig. 4). Likewise internal and antisense categories of promoters achieve ˜85 and ˜89% sensitivity, respectively. Further analysis of promoter prediction in the different categories of transcripts revealed several interesting facts. For example, ˜50% of the primary category of promoter sequences are characterized by all three structural features, viz. stability, bendability and curvature, while remaining promoter sequences lack either one or two structural features (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, majority of internal and antisense categories of promoters are characterized by bendability and curvature while promoters associated with non-coding RNA genes are similar to primary category of promoters (Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggests that the promoter sequences which occur in the coding region, such as internal and antisense promoters, are distinguishable by different structural features, when compared with the primary and non-coding RNA promoter sequences, which are present in the intergenic region.

For example DNA duplex has to be less stable to facilitate easier melting in the vicinity of the TSS during transcription initiation. Hence, in order to study the promoter architecture in terms of structural features, we characterized these features in two classes of promoters, viz. those associated with genes exhibiting high and low gene expression. Gene expression data was obtained from GEO, NCBI expression microarray profiling. The structural properties (stability, bendability and curvature) in the promoter regions associated with high gene expression are found to be more pronounced as compared with low gene expression. A violin plot drawn from the values of DNA structural features underscores the difference in the distribution of probability densities between the promoters associated with high and low expression categories of genes (Fig. 5). The promoters of highly expressed genes were less stable, less bendable and more curved as compared with promoters of lowly expressed genes. One-sided two sample KS test was performed to check if the difference in feature value between the two classes is significant enough for them to be compared (Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly curvature was found to be the only consistent property demarcating promoters from high and low gene expression classes, across all organisms, while other properties show one or more exceptions in case of Synechocystis, Salmonella and Klebsiella.

Plots with shaded background indicate the cases which failed to reject the null hypothesis using two sample KS test at the level of significance of P = 0.01.Trinucleotide preference analysis of the whole promoter region (UP elements and core promoter region) was performed in order to understand the underlying difference in terms of oligonucleotide composition. It showed that overall high expression genes favor rigid and minor groove facing histone preferring trimers, such as AAA/TTT and AAT/ATT while flexible or major groove facing histone preferring trinucleotides like GCC/GGC are less preferred (Supplementary Fig. S5). Preference for AAA/TTT reduces gradually as genomic GC% increases.Promoter prediction using DNA structural features shows that sensitivity for promoters associated with high gene expression is higher as compared with the low gene expression (Fig. 6). Interestingly it was found that promoters associated with higher gene expression are better characterized (higher sensitivity) by a combination of all structural features (stability, bendability and curvature) as compared with those associated with low gene expression. Correspondingly, promoters for low gene expression category are less likely to be predicted as compared with the high gene expression category. Moreover, this trend is present across organisms with varying genomic GC content.

ConclusionDNA sequence dependent structural properties like duplex stability, protein induced bendability and intrinsic curvature are well studied and physiologically relevant properties for the promoter region. Since there is very weak sequence (tetramer) preference and poor sequence motif conservation in the internal and antisense promoters as compared with primary promoters, it is very difficult to identify them using sequence based approaches. Characteristic structural features, on the other hand, are present in the promoter regions of all categories of promoters identified in prokaryotic transcriptomes. Significantly, these properties are not organism specific in nature. However, promoters associated with primary, internal, antisense and non-coding RNA category of transcripts show differences in the profiles of their structural properties. In particular, internal and antisense categories of promoters show distinctly different structural feature profiles as compared with the primary category of promoters. Since a single feature does not predict all promoters, transcriptome can be better annotated using a combinatorial approach. Annotation and analysis of promoters corresponding to the different transcripts present in the transcriptome can provide a better understanding of the complexity involved in gene regulation process. Finally, the promoter DNA structural features show good correlation with the level of expression of the associated gene. Hence by examining structural features associated with promoter regions, one can possibly estimate the level of gene expression.M.B. is the recipient of J. C.

High genomic plasticity allows its adaptation to changing host environments. Complete genomes of H. pylori clinical isolate UM032 and its mice-adapted serial derivatives 298 and 299, generated using both PacBio RS and Illumina MiSeq sequencing technologies, were compared to identify novel elements responsible for host-adaptation. The acquisition of a jhp0562-like allele, which encodes for a galactosyltransferase, was identified in the mice-adapted strains. Our analysis implies a new ß-1,4-galactosyltransferase role for this enzyme, essential for Ley antigen expression. Intragenomic recombination between babA and babB genes was also observed. Further, we expanded on the list of candidate genes whose expression patterns have been mediated by upstream homopolymer-length alterations to facilitate host adaption. Importantly, greater than four-fold reduction of mRNA levels was demonstrated in five genes. Among the down-regulated genes, three encode for outer membrane proteins, including BabA, BabB and HopD. As expected, a substantial reduction in BabA protein abundance was detected in mice-adapted strains 298 and 299 via Western analysis. Our results suggest that the expression of Ley antigen and reduced outer membrane protein expressions may facilitate H. pylori colonisation of mouse gastric epithelium.1. IntroductionHelicobacter pylori infects approximately half the world’s population. It is a Gram-negative microaerophilic pathogen that persistently colonises the human stomach. The bacterium is associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulceration, and less commonly, with gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.1,2 Hence, the organism was classified as a class 1 carcinogen by World Health Organisation in 1994.3Population analysis of H. pylori isolates from different geographical origins has revealed a high degree of genetic diversity within the species. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis has shown that identical alleles are extremely rare in H. pylori even when sampling a large population of the same geographical origin.4 This indicates that H. pylori is able to adapt to a new or rapidly changing environment by undergoing continuous genetic modification. Greater understanding of these modifications and the mechanisms by which they arise will improve the knowledge base from which we may develop new therapeutic targets.The high genetic variation in H. pylori appears to be generated through intragenic and intergenic recombinations, plus extensive mutations attributed to the lack of a nucleotide mismatch repair system, such as that provided in other bacteria by MutS, MutH and MutL.5 There are two families of MutS homologues: MutS1 and MutS2. The MutS1 family includes Escherichia coli MutS, which plays a role in post-replication mismatch repair. In the H. pylori genome, HP0621, a member of the MutS2 family has been identified. However, rather than participating in mismatch repairing, it suppresses homeologous recombination mediated by RecA.6,7 Compared to E. coli, H. pylori is also missing a number of elements responsible for direct repair of DNA damage such as Ada methyltransferase, AlkB oxidative demethylase and Phr/Spl photolyase, as well as several gylcosylases and endonucleases involved in base excision repair including MutM, Tag, AlkA, Mpg, YgjF, Nei and Nfo.8 On the other hand, the presence of a DNA polymerase I that lacks proof-reading activity also contributes to the generation of genomic plasticity in H. pylori.9Rapid phenotype switching is another strategy that enables pathogens to survive in diverse hostile environments and to establish persistent infections in novel hosts. Phenotypic switching can be achieved by epigenetic events, such as DNA methylation and gene silencing mediated by non-coding RNAs. It can also occur via phase-variation-associated genetic modifications, such as site-specific recombination, inversion of promoter elements, insertional inactivation mediated by insertion sequences and slipped-strand mispairing of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) including homopolymeric tracts.10,11Changes in homopolymeric tract length located in coding sequences are known to generate frameshift errors and hence result in expression of truncated and often non-functional proteins.12 While intragenic homopolymeric tract alterations turn protein expression on or off, intergenic variations may alter mRNA level to fine-tune protein expression. This has recently been shown in the adhesin-encoding gene sabA of H. pylori. Altering the length of a poly(T) tract found adjacent to its -35 promoter region changes the mRNA transcript and protein expression levels, as well as the binding to the sialyl Lex receptor.13To date, relatively little is known about H. pylori genetic adaptation in response to selective pressures from its host. It is important to identify these adaptive mutations to provide deeper insights into the exact mechanisms underlying H. pylori infection. Although H. pylori is highly adapted to the human gastric mucosa environment, several animal models comprising mice, gerbils and non-human primates have been used to advance understanding of H. pylori colonisation and pathogenesis.14–16 Whilst experimental studies in humans would be most likely to reveal clinically relevant details, studies in animal models are ethically superior to human challenge experiments, and can still tell us much about the genomic changes associated with host adaptation.Here, we report a follow-up investigation to our previously announced complete genomes of the H. pylori clinical strain UM032 and its mice-adapted derivatives designated 298 and 299. These were sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences RS sequencing technology using the C2 chemistry.17 PacBio RS sequencing technology produces extraordinarily long reads, thus increasing the likelihood of acquiring a complete genome sequence. As opposed to the current C5 chemistry, high error rates were observed in sequencing data generated using the earlier C2 chemistry.18 Therefore, for this study all three strains were also subjected to whole-genome sequencing using Illumina’s MiSeq platform. Hence, the comparative data presented here provide comprehensive information about the changes associated with host change in H. pylori. We reveal H. pylori genetic elements potentially required for host-adaptation and epigenetic regulation of gene expression mediated by homopolymeric tracts present both in the upstream regions of coding sequences, within or in close proximity to the promoter elements, and within the coding sequences.2. Methods2.1. Bacterial strainsThe acquisition of H. pylori clinical strain UM032 and its mice-adapted derivatives, designated 298 and 299 respectively, was as previously described.172.2. Illumina library preparation and sequencingPreparation of MiSeq library was performed using Illumina Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described with minor modifications.19 In brief, 1 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented in 5 µl of Amplicon Tagment Mix and 10 µl of Tagment DNA buffer. Tagmentation reaction was performed by incubation at 55 °C for 5 min followed by neutralisation with 5 µl of Neutralise Tagment Buffer for 5 min. Tagmented DNA (25 µl) was indexed in a 50 µl limited-cycle PCR (12 cycles) as outlined in the Nextera XT protocol and subsequently purified using 25 µl of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc, Australia). The fragment size distribution of the purified DNA was analysed utilising a 2100 Bioanalyser with a High Sensitivity DNA assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA libraries were adjusted to 2 nM, pooled in equal volumes and then denatured with 0.2 N NaOH according to the Nextera protocol. The libraries were sequenced using 2 × 300 paired-end protocols on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 for 600 cycles).2.3. Genome correctionThe generated MiSeq data were used for correction of homopolynucleotide errors present in the previously published H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 complete genomes generated using PacBio C2 chemistry. In brief, MiSeq raw reads were mapped against the complete genome using the Geneious R7 read mapper with the medium sensitivity option.20 Variants were subsequently called using the following parameters: minimum coverage = 10 and minimum variant frequency = 0.7. Reported errors in each reference genome sequence were corrected.2.4. Genome annotationInitially, the genome sequences were automatically annotated using the RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) pipeline.21 In addition to Glimmer (version 3.02) used in the pipeline, additional ORF prediction was performed using GeneMarkS (version 4.7a) and Prodigal (version 2.60).22–24 By majority ruling, the predicted start codons of ORFs predicted from multiple annotation engines were manually curated to enhance start codon accuracy. Genome annotations were further compared against gene sequences from 45 completely sequenced publicly available H. pylori genomes to allow identification of pseudogenes. In our context, a pseudogene can be a non-functional DNA sequence with a frameshift or premature stop codon, a sequence homologous to a protein-coding gene but without ORF or a full-length reference gene broken into two or more adjacent ORFs. Our manually curated genome annotations are available in Supplementary Tables S1–S3. NCBI accession numbers of 45 public genomes used for genome annotation comparison are as follows: 35A (NC_017360), 51 (NC_017382), 52 (NC_017354), 83 (NC_017375), 908 (NC_017357), 2017 (NC_017374), 2018 (NC_017381), 26695 (NC_000915), Aklavik86 (NC_019563), Aklavik117 (NC_019560), B8 (NC_014256), B38 (NC_012973), BM012A (NC_022886), BM012S (NC_022911), Cuz20 (NC_017358), ELS37 (NC_017063), F16 (NC_017368), F30 (NC_017365), F32 (NC_017366), F57 (NC_017367), G27 (NC_011333), Gambia94/24 (NC_017371), HPAG1 (NC_008086), HUP-B14 (NC_017733), India7 (NC_017372), J99 (NC_000921), Lithuania75 (NC_017362), OK113 (NC_020508), OK310 (NC_020509), P12 (NC_011498), PeCan4 (NC_014555), PeCan18 (NC_017742), Puno120 (NC_017378), Puno135 (NC_017379), Sat464 (NC_017359), Shi112 (NC_017741), Shi169 (NC_017740), Shi417 (NC_017739), Shi470 (NC_010698), SJM180 (NC_014560), SNT49 (NC_017376), SouthAfrica7 (NC_017361), SouthAfrica20 (NC_022130), v225d (NC_017355) and XZ274 (NC_017926).2.5. In silico genome analysisThe revised genome sequences of H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 were compared pairwise using progressiveMauve (version 2.3.1), followed by variants calling using Geneious R7.252.6. COG functional analysisCOG of H. pylori UM032 genes with amino acid substitutions detected in the mice-adapted strains 298 and 299 was annotated by rpsblast.262.7. Western immunodetectionWhole cell lysates were prepared from bacterial cells standardised to OD600 of 10. For each blot, 10 µl of sample was used for SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to an Immobilon®-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck Millipore). Blood group antigen-binding adhesin A (BabA) detected with polyclonal antibody, with detection by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualization by chemiluminescent signal using Clarity™ Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) on a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imaging system. H. pylori UreB was detected using rabbit anti-urease B polyclonal antibodies purchased from Sigma Aldrich. H. pylori Le antigen phenotypes were determined using monoclonal antibodies (Abcam) to Lea, Leb, Lex, or Ley. Bound immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma Aldrich) against IgM or IgG.2.8. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)Bacterial total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin® RNA (Macherey-Nagel). After RNA quantification, cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of RNA in a 20 µl reverse transcription reaction using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR analysis was subsequently performed in 20 µl reactions in 96-well plates using cDNA from 20 ng RNA as template, LuminoCt® SYBR® Green qPCR ReadyMixTM (Sigma Aldrich) and the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science). Cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, 56 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Following each run a melting curve analysis was performed in which the reactions were heated slowly from 55 °C to 95 °C (0.1 °C/s). The relative expression of each target gene was calculated using the 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method as described by Livak and Schmittgen27, after normalisation against the gyrA reference gene. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S4. 2.9. Statistical analysisPaired Student’s t-test was used to test for differences in relative quantification of gene expression. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.2.10. Genome sequence updateThe updated complete genomes of UM032, 298 and 299 are available in GenBank under the original accession numbers: NC_021215.3 (GI:685455742), NC_021882.2 (GI:687961717) and NC_021216.3 (GI:685456130).3. Results and discussion3.1. Global pairwise alignment of previously published UM032, 298 and 299 genomes revealed sequence duplications and homopolymeric tract errorsGenomic rearrangement via intragenic recombination is a powerful strategy of gene regulation employed by H. pylori to aid in adaption to host niches and successful colonisation of the gastric mucosa. To investigate the occurrence of chromosomal shuffling events in the mice-adapted UM032 derivatives, progressive Mauve alignment was performed after assigning a common starting point for all three genomes. No genomic rearrangement was observed. However, each genome was shown to harbour an insertion of a large DNA fragment, which measured 5659 bp, 9667 bp and 6578 bp in UM032, 298 and 299, respectively (Fig. 1). BLASTN search demonstrated that each fragment could be further divided into two different regions that closely resemble the neighbouring sequences as depicted in Figure 2. These insertions are probably due to misassembly of the original PacBio sequences, resulting in false segmental duplications.

The presence of homopolymeric tracts in H. pylori is known to play an essential role in phase variation through slipped-strand mispairing, leading to differential antigenic expression that facilitates host-adaptation and persistent colonisation.13 However, it is intriguing to observe such overwhelming mutational bias towards deletion in both 298 and 299 genomes, implying that there is potential sequencing and/or de novo assembly error in the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP) workflow (http://pacbiodevnet.com/) available in Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Analysis v2.0. Sanger sequencing was performed to verify the length of the homopolymeric tract in which variation occurs in 7 randomly chosen UM032 pseudogenes and their functional counterparts. Homopolymer insertion errors detected in selected UM032 pseudogenes could be due to sequencing errors in the original genomes. 3.2. Whole genome resequencing using MiSeqTo remove homopolymer-length sequencing errors and duplications in the original sequences, all three genomes were resequenced using the MiSeq platform with at least 100× sequencing depth. The reads generated were subsequently mapped to the corresponding reference genome as described in Materials and Methods.The analysis of read depth can be a useful approach to check for duplications. It is expected that the read depth at any location is equal to the global average coverage, given that the sequencing reads are randomly distributed across a genome. An average read depth of 135x, 122x and 174x, respectively, was determined for UM032, 298 and 299. The erroneously duplicated sequences, however, had substantially lower read depth than the global read depth and compared to that of the closely resembled upstream and downstream sequences, as summarised in Table 1, indicating they were misassembled and incorrectly present in two copies. The false duplication in each genome was therefore removed. This was followed by remapping of the sequencing reads to determine and compare the reads ratio (regional read depth divided by global read depth) of the previously duplicated sequences and their counterparts across all three genomes. These reads ratios are expected to be comparable among each other. As anticipated, the removal of duplication restored the reads ratio of these now single-copy sequences, as shown in Table 2. It is also now clear that what seemed to be the duplicated sequences are in fact near identical overlaps found at each end of the contig, which failed to be removed during sequence assembly to generate accurate circular consensus DNA sequence. Read depth of erroneous duplicate sequences Please refer to Figure 2 for the position of each sequence fragment described in this table.Read depth of erroneous duplicate sequences Please refer to Figure 2 for the position of each sequence fragment described in this table.Read depth analysis of correct sequences against counterpart sequences following removal of duplicationsRead depth analysis of correct sequences against counterpart sequences following removal of duplicationsAs indicated in Supplementary Table S6, 245 variants were detected in UM032, of which 243 were deletions found within homopolymeric runs. Surprisingly, there were significantly less errors in both 298 and 299 genomes, only seven and three variants being detected, respectively. Nonetheless, the reported errors, including all additional nucleotides found in the homopolymeric tracts, were corrected and the genomes were reannotated as stated in Methods. Table 3 summarises the general features of all three genomes, prior to and after the sequence error correction and reannotation. It is important to highlight that a number of false pseudogene candidates have been efficiently removed, especially in UM032, in which the number has been significantly reduced from 167 to 42, improving the reliability of comparative analysis. General features of pre- and post-correction H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 genomesGeneral features of pre- and post-correction H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299 genomes3.3. Whole genome comparisons of revised H. pylori UM032, 298 and 299The revised complete genome sequences of H. pylori clinical isolate UM032 and its mice-adapted derivatives 298 and 299 were compared against each other. A pairwise global alignment of the genome of UM032 with that of 298 and 299 revealed 99.9% identity at the nucleotide level. The 298 strain contained 89 variants relative to strain UM032, of which 32 were indels and the remaining were substitution mutations including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Supplementary Table S7). Nine indels affected ORFs. In addition to tandem repeats or homopolymeric tracts and additions or deletions to the 5’ or 3’ ends of ORFs, an insertion has introduced a complete ORF, which is annotated as UM298_1363 encoding a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis protein. Amongst the 57 substitutions detected, 16 were intergenic and 41 were located in protein coding sequences. Only 12 of the latter resulted in amino acid changes and the remaining were synonymous substitutions. Relative to 298, only two tandem repeat insertions and 1 deletion within a homopolymeric tract were identified in 299, of which the latter restores an open reading frame designated UM299_0755 (Supplementary Table S8). We further performed a COG (clusters of orthologous groups) analysis on genes with non-synonymous changes (Table 4). Genes without an inferred COG category were also analysed. Together it was shown that genes encoding for outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins are enriched for substitution mutations. COG analysis of UM032 genes with non-synonymous substitutions in its mice-adapted derivativesCOG analysis of UM032 genes with non-synonymous substitutions in its mice-adapted derivativesTaken together, our data have demonstrated an outburst of mutations when UM032 encounters a new host environment. The second round of mice infection using the mice-adapted strain 298 however resulted only in slight genomic alterations in the output strain 299, signifying that the bacterium has undergone sufficient genomic adaptations to establish a chronic infection. It is important to mention that our findings contrast the experimental outcome of Linz et al. who conducted a macaque infection study using the previously macaque-adapted H. pylori strain J166.28 In their study, J166output strains accumulated up to 12 SNPs within 1 week post infection. Our output strain 299, however, showed no SNPs 2 weeks after the infection. This suggests that there was a lack of acute inflammatory response, perhaps due to less variability between the gastric environments of mice, than between those of individual macaques.Of note is that an amino acid change was detected in UM298_1343 relative to UM032_1343. This protein is known as the antigenic membrane-associated tumour necrosis factor a-inducing protein. The change replaces the isoleucine at position 111 for valine. Previous studies have shown that H. pylori TNFa-inducing protein is able to induce interleukin-1a, TNFa, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1a productions in monocytes, as well as tumorigenesis in nude mice implanted with transfected Bhas 42 cells.29,303.4. Intragenomic recombination between babA and babBAmong 65 nucleotide substitutions detected in 298 and 299 relative to UM032, 24 were observed within ORF UM032_1223, which was identified as the babA gene by BLASTN search against the Helicobacter group in NCBI database. Such a high number of mutations could reflect the strong selective pressure for rapid adjustment of BabA-mediated adhesion to facilitate adaptation and colonisation of different host gastric niche. However, these mutations were all synonymous substitutions. Furthermore, rather than being arbitrarily distributed across the 2226 bp gene, they were confined within the C-terminal region, prompting us to investigate whether the mutations could arise due to a recombination event.Paralogous to babA are both babB and babC genes. Due to their extensive sequence identity at 5’ and 3’ regions, intragenomic recombination can occur within the babABC family, resulting in phenotypic change of Lewis b antigen binding capacity.31–34 The bab genes reside in three different chromosomal locations, downstream of the hypD gene (locus A), the rpsR gene (locus B) and hp0318 in H. pylori 26695 (locus C), respectively.31,35 Nevertheless not all bab genes are present within each H. pylori strain. There are some strains which do not possess the babA or babC gene and some harbour two copies of babA or babB gene.36,37 There has also been an interesting observation by Kawai et al. that the babC locus, corresponding to hp0317 in H. pylori 26695, is empty in all the hpEastAsia strains as a result of reductive evolution in the outer membrane protein families.38To test for a recombination event, we performed a BLASTN search of the C-terminal sequence fragment in UM032 genome and identified a complete match in the C-terminal region of a silent babB locus designated UM032_0908. Furthermore, pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of UM032 babA and babB, and 298 babA, along with their downstream sequence indicated the presence of a double crossover recombination event as highlighted in Fig. 3. As there is no conversion of any amino acid residue, no functional change is deduced. It is however unclear whether the synonymous mutations may affect the in vivo translational speed and thus the expression of BabA in strains 298 and 299. To evaluate the possible translational outcome of these synonymous changes in babA, we compared the codon usage of the babA genes to the codon usage of highly expressed genes, specifically the ribosomal genes and the elongation factors, in the measurement of codon adaptation index (CAI) computed using EMBOSS CAI application.39 The UM032 babA gene achieved a CAI score of 0.693, compared to a slightly lower value of 0.689 in the recombined version found in 298 and 299. Under such condition, the latter is less optimally encoded, by 0.4%, suggesting that there would only be marginal effect on protein expression levels.

Mutations in LPS biosynthesis genesAmong the 89 total variants identified in 298 relative to UM032, 10 were located in two genes designated UM298_1086 and UM298_1395. There is no genotypic difference present in these genes between strains 298 and 299. BLASTN comparison revealed that both genes encode for fucosyltranferase (FucT) that plays a substantial role in the synthesis of Lewis (Le) antigens of which the former gene product exhibits 75.9% amino acid sequence identity to HP0651 (FutB) whilst the latter harbours 78.3% identical amino acids to that of HP0379 (FutA). In H. pylori genomes, there are three phase-variable FucT-encoding genes, termed futA, futB and futC. FutA and FutB, both are paralogous and can fucosylate either Lec antigen (type I carbohydrate backbone) in a a-(1,4) linkage to generate Lea antigen, and/or N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc) (type II carbohydrate backbone) in a a-(1,3) linkage to create Lex antigen.40–42 Both Lea and Lex antigens can be further fucosylated by FutC in a a-(1,2) manner to create difucoslylated Leb or Ley (Fig. 5).43In addition to the nucleotide variations found in FucT encoding genes, a 1-kb insertion was identified upstream of the UM032_1363 counterpart in both the 298 and the 299 genomes, designated UM298_1364 and UM299_1364 respectively. UM032_1363 shares approximately 80% nucleotide sequence identity with HP0619 in H. pylori strain 26695, and jhp0563 in H. pylori strain J99. Jhp0563 is a ß-(1,3)galT gene with a product essential for the expression of Lec.44 The upstream homologous glycosyltransferase-encoding gene jhp0562, is however absent in several H. pylori strains including 26695.45 Due to a high degree of shared nucleotide sequence identity, it has been demonstrated that both jhp0562 and ß-(1,3)galT genes can undergo intragenic recombination within a single strain to generate functional chimeric alleles. This explains why certain strains do not possess a jhp0562 allele.45 Interestingly, the 1-kb insertion has introduced a gene which is 90.7% similar to jhp0562 in the mice-derivative strains, designated 298_1363 and 299_1363 respectively. In this study, the mice were inoculated intragastrically with a pool consisting of 12 H. pylori clinical strains including UM032. The jhp0562-like allele was probably acquired by homologous recombination from one of the other strains inoculated.To further examine how the genotypic changes above would affect Le antigen phenotypic expression, immunoblots were performed on proteinase K-treated whole cell lysates with antibodies detecting Lea, Leb, Lex and Ley (Fig. 4). All three strains reacted with the Leb antibody but differed in the sizes of decorated O-antigen chains. The immunoblot experiments also detected strong Ley expression in strains 298 and 299. However, only a trace level of Ley was detected in input strain UM032. Figure 5 shows the Le antigen synthesis model in UM032 with all anticipated glycosyltransferase-encoding genes listed. The detection of both Leb and Ley indicates the presence of the a-1,2-fucosylation process, which is expected since all three strains had an identical in-frame futC gene. Last but not least, none of these strains revealed any detectable levels of Lea and Lex (data not shown), suggesting that there is a relatively high activity of FutC in these strains, leading to complete a-1,2-fucosylation of these substrates once presented. In addition, terminal fucosylation could have masked internal Lea or Lex and therefore hindered antibody detection.

GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; LacNAc, N-acetyl-D-lactosamine.The minute expression of Ley in strain UM032 might be either due to low level of endogenous a-1,3-FucT activity or a low LacNAc content and thus a reduced expression of Lex. In strain UM032, the futA gene (UM032_1394) is switched off because its intragenic poly(C) tract located near the ATG start codon lacks one nucleotide, resulting in out-of-frame translation. The futB gene, by contrast, is in-frame, yielding correct full-length FucT enzyme in each strain. Given that FutA is inactive, the presence of both Leb and Ley in strain UM032 indicates that its FutB enzyme, encoded by UM032_1086, must contain both a-1,3 and a-1,4 properties. This is in agreement with our prediction by pairwise comparison that UM032_1086 displays extensive amino acid identity of 93.1% with a previously documented a-1,3/4-FucT found in H. pylori strain UA948 (GenBank accession number AF194963) (Table 5).40,46Amino acid sequence identities between H. pylori fucosyltransferasesThe enzymatic activity is predicted based on amino acid sequence comparison.Amino acid sequence identities between H. pylori fucosyltransferasesThe enzymatic activity is predicted based on amino acid sequence comparison.However, it has been demonstrated that UA948FucT exhibits a greater than 5-fold affinity towards the type II chain precursor to generate Lex. This does not support the hypothesis that a low level of a-1,3 activity is present within strain UM032. We next tested whether the minor changes in the amino acid composition could have altered the acceptor substrate affinity to make UM032_1086 favour the type I over the type II chain. To address this question, we performed protein structure modelling comparing both UA948FucT and UM032_1086. Figure 6 shows the models of UA948FucT and UM032_1086, each model based on the crystal structure of uncomplexed FucT (PDB ID: 2NZW). The catalytic sites accounting for interaction with the donor substrate, GDP-fucose, are highlighted. While it is accepted that structure modelling can be insensitive to minor amino acid changes, no structural differences were observed between the two models. Thus, it seems unlikely that there is distinct acceptor substrate specificity between UA948FucT and UM032_1086.

The catalytic sites accounting for interaction with the donor substrate, GDP-fucose, are highlighted.An alternative hypothesis is that the amount of LacNAc is inherently low within the UM032 strain, permitting FutB to utilise Lec for Lea synthesis once the LacNAc reservoir is depleted. To enhance LacNAc production and thus Ley expression in strains 298 and 299, an additional copy of gylcosyltransferase gene must be present. This is consistent with the acquisition of a jhp0562-like allele in both strains. jhp0562 has been demonstrated in previous mutagenesis and complementation studies as an essential component in both type I and type II Le synthesis pathways.45 Despite displaying only 21% nucleotide sequence similarity to known ß-(1,4)galT genes including jhp0765 and HP0826, our findings offer further support for the idea that the product of this acquired jhp0562-like allele contains ß-1,4-galactosyltransferase activity for the conversion of N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlyNAc) to LacNAc. Subsequently the expression of full-length FutA, which is expected to exhibit similar functions to that of FutB by conserving approximately 93.4% amino acids, in strains 298 and 299, provides additional a-1,3 enzymatic activity to produce Lex that is immediately converted into Ley by FutC.The occurrence of genotypic and phenotypic changes in Le antigens in strain 298 relative to the input strain UM032, but not between strains 298 and 299, reflects an initial event of host-driven Le antigen expression adaptation taking place in H. pylori upon its first encounter to a new host species. This would aid the bacterium in establishment of long-term colonisation. The acquisition of jhp0562-like allele further suggests that the product of this non-phase-variable allele may further confer an increase in competitive advantage among H. pylori strains.3.6. Intergenic homopolymeric tract length alterations affect gene expressionIn this study, a number of intragenic and intergenic homopolymeric tract length changes were detected in strains 298 and 299 (Tables 6 and 7). In order to verify if these variations in intergenic homopolymeric tract lengths influence the expression of adjacent genes, we performed qRT-PCR analysis to better understand how these transcriptional changes, if any, can possibly facilitate novel host colonisation. Data are shown as fold change relative to the transcriptional level of each corresponding gene in strain UM032, as depicted in Figure 7. Among nine tested gene candidates, five were significantly greater than four-fold down-regulated, including UM032_0212 (hypothetical protein), UM032_0548 (HopD), UM032_0781 (biotin synthase), UM032_0908 (BabB) and UM032_1223 (BabA). A less than two-fold change was observed between UM032_0213 (CTP synthase) and its counterparts. No amplification was detected for UM032_0025, UM032_0547 and UM032_1372 (data not shown), suggesting that these genes were either not expressed or were expressed at very low levels.

However, UM032_0212 transcription was significantly down-regulated at the poly(A) tract positioned 3 nucleotides upstream of the -35 element thatwas altered in length. The latter result was consistent with the findings of Åberg et al. that variation in the length of homopolymeric tracts located adjacent to the -35 element modulates promoter activity by changing local DNA structure and thereby binding of the RNA polymerase.13 Similarly, transcriptional activity was also reduced in both outer membrane protein-encoding UM032_0548 and UM32_0908 as the poly(T) tract situated ~20 nucleotides upstream of each -35 element was reduced by single base pair in both strains 298 and 299. This indicates that regulation via variation in homopolymeric tract is a fairly general mechanism in H. pylori.On the other hand, BabA-encoding UM032_1223 had an altered poly(A) tract located between the -35 and -10 elements. A Western immunoblot was further conducted using anti-BabA antibody and as expected, BabA expression was nearly lost in strains 298 and 299 (Fig. 8). We also performed another Western analysis with commercial polyclonal antibody against H. pylori urease B (UreB) to demonstrate that comparable amounts of proteins are loaded in each lane (Fig. 9). It has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies that variation in the distance between these two consensus elements can affect RNA polymerase binding and thus the efficiency of gene transcription.47,48 Last but not least, the altered poly(G) tract of down-regulated UM032_0781 was found to lie more than 150 nucleotides upstream of the -35 region. This is probably due to the presence of an unknown distal negative cis-acting element, similar to that found in the phase variable NadA adhesin of Neisseria meningitides.49Figure 8Open in new tabDownload slideWestern immunodetection of BabA in H. pylori strains UM032, 298 and 299.

Recently, it was reported that enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is able to regulate its adherence to intestinal epithelial cells by sensing surrounding biotin level.50 Upon its arrival in the low-biotin large intestine, EHEC down-regulates the expression of its biotin protein ligase BirA to remove the repression on the global regulator Fur, thereby activating LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) genes to promote bacterial adherence. In H. pylori, both BirA and Fur are also present (designated HP1140 and HP1027 in strain 26695, respectively).51 Nevertheless, it is uncertain in H. pylori if BirA may interact with Fur in a similar paradigm to that of E. coli as it lacks the N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix regulatory domain. It is tempting to hopothesise that the down-regulated expression of biotin synthase could possibly result in low intracellular biotin concentration, thus allowing derepression of Fur by BirA, which in turns activates genes involved in motility and chemotaxis to facilitate host colonisation.52 This warrants further investigation. The down-regulation of outer membrane protein genes, especially babA, however, is thought to increase bacterial dispersion and colonisation by preventing autoaggregation which might occur as a result of binding to LPS Leb antigen.3.7. Concluding remarksWhen H. pylori encounters a hostile foreign environment, the bacterium rapidly adapts to the new environment via a series of genomic alterations. Here, we demonstrated that a host change led to modification of the Lewis antigen profile of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide via acquisition of a jhp0562-like allele. In addition, expression levels of outer membrane proteins including BabA, BabB and HopD changed via altered homopolymeric tract lengths. These observations provide further evidence that rapid changes in membrane associated protein expressions play a major role in the early adaptation of bacterial populations to an individual host and these components are one of the key factors in H. pylori’s success as a pathogen.This project was supported by the University of Malaya-Ministry of Education (UM-MoE) High Impact Research (HIR) grant (reference UM.C/625/1/HIR/MoE/CHAN13/3; Account No. H-50001-A000030), the National Health and Medical Research Council (grant no. 572723), the Vice Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, and the Western Australian Department of Commerce and Department of Health.

In this study, the draft genome sequence of a monoecious bitter gourd inbred line, OHB3-1, was analyzed. Through Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly, scaffolds of 285.5 Mb in length were generated, corresponding to ~84% of the estimated genome size of bitter gourd (339 Mb). In this draft genome sequence, 45,859 protein-coding gene loci were identified, and transposable elements accounted for 15.3% of the whole genome. According to synteny mapping and phylogenetic analysis of conserved genes, bitter gourd was more related to watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) than to cucumber (Cucumis sativus) or melon (C. melo). Using RAD-seq analysis, 1507 marker loci were genotyped in an F2 progeny of two bitter gourd lines, resulting in an improved linkage map, comprising 11 linkage groups. By anchoring RAD tag markers, 255 scaffolds were assigned to the linkage map. Comparative analysis of genome sequences and predicted genes determined that putative trypsin-inhibitor and ribosome-inactivating genes were distinctive in the bitter gourd genome. These genes could characterize the bitter gourd as a medicinal plant.1. IntroductionBitter gourd (Momordica charantia, 2n = 2x = 221) is a dicot vine species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae originating in tropical Asia. Bitter gourd, also known as African cucumber, bitter cucumber, bitter melon, balsam pear, or karela in the region,2,3 is characterized by its warty-skinned fruit and is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The flesh of bitter gourd fruit tastes bitter owing to the presence of the cucurbitacin-like alkaloid, momordicine, and triterpene glycosides. Bitter gourd fruit are rich in vitamin C and phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity.4–7 Additionally, leaf decoction of bitter gourd is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of stomach pain, anemia, malaria, coughs, and fever.8 Recently, several studies have shown its antidiabetic effect in vitro and in vivo.9–11 Therefore, these properties have given the plant a high medicinal value and made it the subject of recent scientific research. Similar to other Cucurbitaceae crops, bitter gourd is a monoecious plant species. However, some gynoecious lines have been found,4 providing useful genetic resources (as maternal plants) in breeding programs for the production of F1 hybrids. Matsumura et al.12 succeeded in genetically mapping the locus responsible for gynoecy and identified restriction-associated DNA tag sequencing (RAD-seq) markers linked to the locus. In Cucumis spp., sex determination has been well studied, and ethylene has been shown to play a key role in its regulation. Genes encoding aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase have been shown to be responsible for gynoecy, unisexual flower development, and andromonoecy in cucumber or melon.13–15 Through silver nitrate mediated inhibition of ethylene, production of female flowers in the gynoecious bitter gourd was obstructed in favor of bisexual flowers, indicating the possible involvement of ethylene in the sex determination. However, because of the limited genome sequence information in comparison to cucumber,16 melon,17 and watermelon,18 the genes underlying sex determination in bitter gourd are yet to be identified.In this study, we determined the whole genome sequence of bitter gourd, which was generated through the Illumina next-generation sequencing platform followed by de novo assembly. Ab initio gene prediction and annotation of predicted genes were also carried out. Based on these assembled genome sequences and gene prediction, the bitter gourd genome was compared with known genome sequences of other Cucurbitaceae species. Additionally, through RAD-seq analysis, a linkage map was constructed onto which the assembled scaffolds were assigned. These results provided a basis for gene identification and DNA marker development in bitter gourd, and a platform for studying evolution in Cucurbitaceae species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA preparationA monoecious inbred line OHB3-1 developed by the Okinawa Prefectural Agricultural Research Center was used for de novo sequencing of the bitter gourd genome. Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using a NucleoSpin Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RAD-seq analysis, two parental bitter gourd lines, OHB61-5 and OHB95-1A, and their F2 progeny12 were used as materials.2.2. Library preparation and sequencingSequencing libraries were prepared from genomic DNA for Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq2500 platforms. A short insert (330 bp) paired-end (PE) library was constructed using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina), which reduced PCR amplification bias in library preparation. Mate-paired (MP) libraries with various insert sizes (2, 4, 6, and 8 kbp) were constructed using the Nextera Mate Pair Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). The PE library was sequenced using MiSeq (2 × 230 bp) and the four MP libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2500 (2 × 100 bp).2.3. Sequence assemblySequence reads in fastq files from MiSeq and HiSeq2500 were quality-filtered by FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). For de novo assembly, sequence reads with a PHRED quality score of = 30 comprising of = 90% of the reads were extracted. After adaptor trimming and removal of reads with inappropriate insert sizes in MP libraries using an in-house pipeline of scripts, qualified reads (Supplementary Table S3) were applied to de novo assembly using ALLPATHS-LG assembler version R4985619 with setting PLOIDY = 2 and HAPLOIDIFY = True. All the constructed scaffold sequences were aligned with each other using BLASTN, and perfectly identical scaffolds to others in entire sequences, were excluded as duplicated scaffolds. In the remaining scaffolds showing similarity to others, when the observed frequency of mismatch and indel sites per 1,000 bases was less than 1 in both aligned scaffold sequences, they were presumed to be allelic.For mitochondrial (Mt) or chloroplast (Cp) genome sequences, PE and MP reads were aligned to 80 and 697 Mt and Cp reference genome sequences in the NCBI database (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) version 0.6.1 with default parameters, respectively. Mapped reads to Mt or Cp reference sequences were extracted from the original fastq files, and applied to the assembly using ALLPATHS-LG as described above.2.4. Gene prediction and annotationGene prediction analysis in the bitter gourd scaffold sequences was carried out using ab initio prediction by FGENESH software ver 3.1.1 (Softberry)20 based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based gene prediction (Supplementary method). For annotating predicted genes, encoded protein sequences were applied to the BLASTP search against the non-redundant (NR) protein database in NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/) and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (http://www.uniprot.org), respectively. As domain searches of encoded proteins of predicted genes, all the amino acid sequences were applied to InterProscan version 5.19-58.0 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) with default settings (Supplementary method). Transposable elements in the predicted genes were identified using TransposonPSI (http://transposonpsi.sourceforge.net/), and only the top hits against individual library searches with default settings were employed for their annotation.2.5. Comparative analysis of genomes among Cucurbitaceae speciesComparison of the bitter gourd genome and other Cucurbitaceae genomes was performed by mapping OHB3-1 scaffold sequences to cucumber (cucumber_ChineseLong_v2_genome, http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi),16 melon (CM3.5.1_pseudomol, https://melonomics.net/),17 and watermelon (WCG_chromosome_v1, http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi)18 genome sequences using SyMap 4.2 (http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap/).212.6. Conserved genes among Cucurbitaceae species and unique genes in bitter gourd genomeBy comparing a list of anchors analyzed by the SyMap program, genes showing conserved synteny among all four Cucurbitaceae species were identified, and applied to phylogenetic analysis using Aminosan22 and RAxML23 as described in Supplementary method.To identify genes showing unique structures in the bitter gourd genome, anchor gene lists in the SyMap analysis were compared in all four Cucurbitaceae species. Unanchored genes to any predicted genes in melon, cucumber, or watermelon genomes, were found. Reversely, conserved (syntenic) genes among melon, cucumber, and watermelon genomes, but not in the bitter gourd genome, were also found. Functional annotation of these selected genes was determined by domain searches of encoded protein sequences using InterProScan as described above.2.7. RAD-seq analysisRAD-seq analysis was performed as described previously.12 Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with AseI restriction endonuclease, and a biotinylated adapter, harboring index sequences, was ligated to the digested DNA fragments. The adapter ligated genomic DNA fragments were then digested with NlaIII restriction endonuclease. Biotinylated fragments were collected using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M270, Thermofisher), and the additional adapter was ligated to the end of the fragments on the magnetic beads. These adapter-ligated fragments on the beads were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were then sequenced using the HiSeq2500 system. From the sequence reads, 80 bp sequences including AseI-recognition sites were extracted as RAD-seq tags. Tag extraction and counting was carried out using CLC Genomics Workbench software (Qiagen).2.8. Reference mapping of RAD-seq tagsTag sequences showing more than 20 counts in either parent line (OHB61-5 or OHB95-1A) were employed in further analysis. These tag sequences (80 bp) were mapped to the scaffold sequences of OHB3-1 as ‘reference sequences’ using BWA version 0.6.1 in DDBJ Read Annotation Pipeline (https://p.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/pipeline/). Procedures for detection of polymorphic or heterozygous loci were described in Supplementary method.2.9. Linkage map developmentAn RAD-seq analysis of 97 F2 plants derived from OHB61-5 and OHB95-1A was carried out as described above. Based on analyzed RAD-seq data in individual F2 plants, genotypes of bi-allelic tags as co-dominant markers were determined following a previously described method.12 Genotyping procedure and a linkage map construction using JoinMap4.1 (Kyazma)24 were described in Supplmentary method.2.10. Comparative analysis of orthologous and paralogous genesHomologues of genes for putative trypsin inhibitor, ribosome inactivating protein, ACC synthase and CmWip1 were identified by BLAST searches against predicted genes in melon, cucumber and watermelon genome. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA7.0.18.25 Detail of analysis was described in Supplementary method.2.11. RT-PCR analysisTotal RNA was extracted from flower buds of bitter gourd plant, and expression of sex determination-related genes was analyzed by RT-PCR as described in Supplementary method.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the bitter gourd genomeIn the current study, a monoecious inbred line (OHB3-1) of bitter gourd was used for genome sequencing using the Illumina platform. Paired-end (PE) and mate-pair (MP; with 2, 4, 6, and 8 kbp inserts) libraries were constructed from genomic DNA and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq2500 DNA sequencer. For PE library development, PCR amplification was avoided and long read sequencing (2×230 bp) was carried out. The total length of the analyzed sequence reads amounted to over 37 Gb (Supplementary Table S3), which was equivalent to approximately 110 times that of the estimated genome size (339 Mb) of bitter gourd,26 representing a sufficient quantity of sequence reads for whole genome assembly. Using these sequence reads, scaffolds were constructed using the ALLPATHS-LG assembler.19 Using BLAST analysis of the assembled scaffolds of each other, six pairs of putative allelic scaffolds (scaffold_617 and 614, 950, and 911, 988 and 901, 699 and 700, 690 and 691, 657 and 604), which contained mismatch and/or indel sites, were found. However, since it was difficult to discriminate between allelic and paralogous sequences in this study, they were included in the draft genome sequence data as independent scaffolds in this study. The total length of the assembled scaffolds was 285.5 Mb, which comprised 1,029 scaffolds (Table 1), corresponding to approximately 84% of the previously estimated genome size.26 The N50 value of these scaffolds was 1.1 Mb, and the longest scaffold sized was over 7 Mb (Table 1). According to previous studies, coverage (%) and N50 values of assembled sequences were 66% and 1.1 Mb in cucumber,16 83% and 4.7 Mb in melon,17 and 83% and 2.3 Mb in watermelon,18 respectively. The present genome assembly of bitter gourd is comparable to the assembly of other cucurbits genomes. However, 15% of the genome was undetermined in the present sequencing analysis. It is possible that the redundant regions of the genome, such as sequences encoding multiple copies of repeats or transposons, interfered with accurate assembly, resulting in shorter assembled scaffolds than the actual complete genome. Among the scaffolds of the OHB3-1 genome, sequences of 94,148 ambiguous degenerate bases (0.03%) were present, possibly owing to heterozygous loci or assembly of redundant regions (data not shown). Summary of assembly results in OHB3-1 genome sequenceSummary of assembly results in OHB3-1 genome sequenceBased on 80 mitochondrial and 697 chloroplast reference genome sequences (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), scaffolds for organelle genome were developed. Scaffold length of the mitochondrial genome was 312,781 bp, and the total length of three scaffolds of the chloroplast genome was 40,659 bp (Table 1). Through the BLAST search, the scaffold sequence of the bitter gourd mitochondrial genome showed high similarity to the watermelon mitochondrial genome sequence (Supplementary Table S4). In the assembled chloroplast genome, scaffold1, scaffold2, and scaffold3 showed the highest similarity to the plastid or chloroplast genome of five-leaf ginseng (Gynostemma pentaphyllum) or cucumber, bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and melon, respectively (Supplementary Table S4).3.2. Gene prediction and transposon explorationGenes in the scaffold sequence of OHB3-1 were inferred by an ab initio prediction using the FGENESH program.20 In total, 45,859 protein-coding genes were found as predicted genes in the OHB3-1 scaffold sequence (Table 2, Supplementary Table S5). Their average number of CDS (coding sequences) per a predicted gene was 4.41 and 8,512 genes constituted only a single CDS. Length of encoded protein in these predicted genes was 331 a.a on average. Transcription start sites and polyadenylation sites in the predicted genes were also found in 45,267 and 45,799 genes, respectively. Gene content in the bitter gourd scaffolds was more than that in the other sequenced Cucurbitaceae genomes (26,682 in cucumber,16 27,427 in melon,17 and 23,440 in watermelon18). This is possibly because transcript information, such as EST (expressed sequence tag) data, was also incorporated in the gene prediction in other Cucurbitaceae genomes. Annotation of predicted genes was performed by a BLASTP search of their encoded protein sequences against non-redundant (NR) protein and UniProt database (Supplementary Table S6). Consequently, encoded proteins of 34,986 and 25,348 predicted genes showed a similarity to the sequences in NR and UniProt databases, respectively. Most of them (25,268 proteins) showed hits to both the NR and UniProt databases, whereas 80 proteins showed only hits to sequences in the UniProt, but not the NR database. In these predicted genes, 8,839 genes encoded putative transposons as determined through TransposonPSI analysis (Supplementary Table S7, Table 2). Sequences of these putative transposons (43,834 kb) accounted for ~15.3% of the total scaffolds of the OHB3-1 genome. The majority (65%) of them belonged to the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, Ty1/copia or Ty3/gypsy. The Ty3/gypsy type was the most abundant (35.6%), covering 5.5% of the total genome. Considering class II transposons (DNA transposons), the CACTA family was the most abundant (24.7%), comprising 3.8% of the total scaffold. For annotating predicted genes, domain searching was also carried out by InterProscan. Domain search results of their encoded protein sequences against Pfam, SMART, ProDom, and PRINTS databases were indicated in Supplementary Table S8. In total, putative encoded proteins for 24,183 genes had any conserved domains (Table 2). Of the unannotated genes by BLAST, conserved domains were found in 23 predicted genes. Consequently, BLAST and conserved domain searching resulted in the annotation of 36,086 predicted genes (~75% of the predicted genes) in total. Summary of predicted genes in bitter gourd (OHB3-1) scaffold sequenceaPrediction of protein-coding genes and their translated sequences were conducted by FGENESH.bEncoded amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were applied to BLASTP searching against non-redundant protein database in NCBI and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database or InterProscan analysis for conserved domain searching.cTransposable elements in the predicted genes were surveyed by TranposonPSI.Summary of predicted genes in bitter gourd (OHB3-1) scaffold sequenceaPrediction of protein-coding genes and their translated sequences were conducted by FGENESH.bEncoded amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were applied to BLASTP searching against non-redundant protein database in NCBI and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database or InterProscan analysis for conserved domain searching.cTransposable elements in the predicted genes were surveyed by TranposonPSI.3.3. Similarity of genome sequences in bitter gourd with Cucurbitaceae speciesA comparison of the bitter gourd genome with those of other Cucurbitaceae crops was performed by synteny mapping of the OHB3-1 scaffolds (285.5 Mb) against pseudomolecule sequences of cucumber, melon and watermelon using the SyMap 4.2 program.21 In this analysis, genome or scaffold sequences of two species were aligned and ‘anchors’, which allowed the connection of two genomes, were determined by filtering based on annotated gene (predicted gene) information. Synteny blocks were defined as regions consisting of more than seven anchors between two species. Synteny blocks against the bitter gourd scaffolds covered 80–90% of each cucurbit genome sequence (Supplementary Table S9). In the watermelon genome, a few synteny blocks of a long length (>10 Mb) were observed, whereas only short (<1 Mb) fragmented blocks were mapped in the melon and cucumber genomes (Supplementary Table S9, Supplementary Figs S1–S3), implying relative structural similarities between the bitter gourd and watermelon. In the SyMap analysis, conserved genes connected between the bitter gourd scaffold and other cucurbit genomes were identified as anchors. In the bitter gourd predicted genes, 16,820, 16,063, and 16,083 genes were defined as anchors (Supplementary Table S10), which corresponded to genes in the watermelon, melon, and cucumber genome, respectively, and 14,775 loci presumed to be conserved in all compared Cucurbitaceae species. Of the genes at these loci, multiplicated (redundant) genes in each genome or scaffold sequences were eliminated, and 69 loci were defined as unique in each cucurbit genome and conserved among all four species (Supplementary Table S11). Based on the alignment of encoded amino acid sequences of these orthologous genes at each locus (Supplementary Table S12), phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by RAxML as described in Supplementary method. According to the constructed phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. S4), bitter gourd was related to watermelon, rather than Cucumis spp., but it was evolutionary distant from other species. Previous studies suggested bitter gourd was more closely related to watermelon than to cucumber or melon, according to the internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes27 or sequences of chloroplast genes.28 Our results of synteny mapping and phylogenetic analysis seemed to support these results, but further information of genome sequences in more Cucurbitaceae species is necessary to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships precisely.3.4. Unique gene finding in the bitter gourd genomeThe synteny mapping analysis by using SyMap allowed to identify unique genes and gene orders in bitter gourd scaffolds. By comparing anchor gene lists (Supplementary Table S10), 3,158 annotated genes in the bitter gourd scaffolds did not correspond to any genes in other cucurbits genomes. Reversely, 2,468 genes were conserved in the genome of three cucurbit species but absent in the bitter gourd scaffolds. Comparing the functional annotation of these characteristic genes (uniquely present or absent) in bitter gourd genome, two gene classes were distinguished. Predicted genes encoding putative trypsin inhibitor-like proteins were more frequently observed in the bitter gourd genome than other cucurbits genomes (Supplementary Table S13), and 29 genes encoding trypsin inhibitor-like proteins were clustered in the non-syntenic scaffold regions to the other three Cucurbitaceae genomes (Supplementary Table S14). No known conserved domain was found in encoded proteins of 10 genes (Supplementary Table S14), but showed a sequence similarity to cucumber trypsin inhibitor-like proteins by the BLAST search. Of these genes, three genes in scaffold_32 (MOMC32_28g, MOMC32_34g, and MOMC32_37g) encoded identical or homologous proteins to Mch-1 or Mch-2,29 which were isolated from bitter gourd seeds. Although the conserved domain as the trypsin inhibitor was not observed in these proteins, it was shown that they had trypsin inhibition activity.29 In another study, mcIRBP, corresponding to MOMC1_984, was isolated from bitter gourd seeds as an insulin receptor-binding protein, and its injection reduced blood glucose levels in mice,30 implying its possible application to anti-diabetic medication. Phylogenetic analysis of putative trypsin inhibitors in bitter gourd showed that proteins with the I7 protease inhibitor and I13 protease inhibitor domains were separated, and several proteins without conserved domains (Supplementary Table S14) were categorized in the I7 protease inhibitor group. MOMC32_27, MOMC32_28, MOMC32_34 (Mch-2), and MOMC32_37 (Mch-1) formed a monophyletic group, close to I7 protease inhibitors (Fig. 1).

Based on 34 amino acid sequences of trypsin inhibitor proteins and 18 amino acid sequences of ribosome inactivating proteins of bitter gourd (Supplementary Table S12, S14, and S15), phylogenetic tree for each protein family was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method by MEGA7.0.18. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site.

Additional notably unique genes in bitter gourd genome were ribosomal inactivating protein (RIP) genes. RIP is known as a plant toxin, which has N-glycosidase activity against adenine nucleotide in ribosomal RNA.31 Most RIPs were classified into two groups (type 1 and type 2).31 Type 1 RIP is a monomeric protein encoding the N-glycosidase activity domain (A-chain), and type 2 RIP consists of A-chain and B-chain (lectin-like domain). Multiple copies of RIP genes were observed in the Cucurbitaceae genome, but more paralogous genes, including both genes encoding A-chain (18 genes) and B-chain (8 genes), were present in the bitter gourd scaffolds than other cucurbit genomes (Supplementary Table S13). These bitter gourd RIP genes were clustered in six scaffolds, which were non-syntenic regions to other cucurbits genomes (Supplementary Table S15). Biological functions of RIPs in plants were not always well elucidated, but were possibly involved in the defense system against pathogenic fungi or bacteria via rRNA cleavage.32,33 On the other side, bitter gourd RIPs were well studied as a possible medically effective ingredient.34. Alpha-momorcharin and MAP30 were type-1 RIPs isolated from bitter gourd, and shown to have anti-viral and -tumor activity in mammalian cells.35,36 When these RIPs were used to treat HIV-infected cells, inhibition of viral replication was observed36 and additionally, MAP30 also inhibited integrase acitivty of HIV and topologically inactivated viral DNA37. Against tumor cells, it was demonstrated that both alpha-momorcharin and MAP30-induced apoptosis.35 Particularly, MAP30 caused little damage to normal cells,38 whereas cytotoxicity to normal liver cells was observed in alpha-momorcharin.39 Therefore, the clinical application of MAP30 was expected in cancers or protection for viral infection. Similarly, trichosanthin (TCS) from Trichosanthes kirilowii40 and balsamin from Momordica balsamina41 are known to have anti-viral activity. Alignment of amino acid sequences of balsamin showed that it was identical to MAP30 (data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis of TCS and the A-chain of RIPs in bitter gourd indicated TCS was closely related to alpha-momorcharin (Fig. 1). Although the biological functions of these trypsin inhibitors and RIPs are still unknown in bitter gourd plants, multiplication of genes for these proteins is unique to the bitter gourd genome, which might characterize bitter gourd as a medicinal plant.3.5. Mapping of RAD-seq tagsWe previously performed RAD-seq analysis to identify DNA polymorphisms between the two bitter gourd lines (OHB95-1A and OHB61-5).12 In this study, the RAD-seq tag sequences, represented by 80-base sequences from the AseI-digested ends of genomic DNA, were mapped to the OHB3-1 scaffolds as reference sequences for finding polymorphic loci at unique positions in the genome. As shown in Supplementary Table S16, ~90% of applied tags were mapped to unique positions of the OHB3-1 genome, whereas the other tags matched multiple loci on the genome. These uniquely mapped tags were distributed in 80% of the assembled scaffolds (Supplementary Table S16). Firstly, the RAD-tag mapping analysis determined the mismatches or indels between OHB61-5 or OHB95-1A and reference sequences (OHB3-1). As shown in Supplementary Table S16, ~3% of the uniquely reference-mapped tags in each inbred line contained mismatches and/or indels, representing an average frequency of these polymorphic loci as once per 2.7 kb in the bitter gourd genome. In addition, based on the tag-mapping results, putative heterozygous loci in each parent line were identified as described in the method, and 1,279 and 884 loci were predicted to be heterozygous in OHB95-1A and OHB61-5, respectively (Supplementary Table S16). The frequency of these putative heterozygous loci was < 1% of the uniquely tag-mapped loci, implying low heterozygosity in these inbred lines.3.6. Linkage map construction using RAD-seq markersFrom the RAD-seq results of two inbred lines and tag mapping to scaffold sequences of OHB3-1 as a reference, bi-allelic tags at polymorphic loci between OHB61-5 and OHB95-1A could be identified as described in Supplementary method. Totally, 1,507 pairs (loci) of bi-allelic tags polymorphic between the two parental lines were identified and employed as co-dominant markers in linkage mapping analyses (Supplementary Table S17). An F2 population derived from OHB61-5 × OHB95-1A was previously developed12 and employed to generate a linkage map. Genomic DNA from 97 F2 individuals was used in RAD-seq analysis using AseI, resulting in an average of 8,005,294 tags per an F2 plant. Genotypes of 1,507 bi-allelic tag markers in each F2 plant were determined based on the presence or absence of the allelic tag sequence. According to the genotype data of 1,507 markers in 97 plants, linkage positions of analyzed markers were determined using JoinMap4.1 software. At a cut-off LOD score = 7.0, 1,423 markers were separated into 11 linkage groups (Supplementary Table S18), which corresponded to the number of chromosomes in bitter gourd. The order of these markers in each linkage group was determined by calculating the genetic distances among markers, and a linkage map, encompassing 3,426 cM, was constructed (Supplementary Fig. S5). In accordance with the positions of the analyzed markers (bi-allelic tags) in the reference genome sequence, 255 scaffolds could be anchored to the constructed linkage map (Supplementary Table S18). Although analyzed RAD-seq tags were located in 80% of the assembled scaffolds, only 255 scaffolds (25%) were assigned on the linkage map, indicating that the frequency of bi-allelic tags were limited. Positions of RAD tag markers in each scaffold almost corresponded to their order in the linkage map, although inconsistency was occasionally observed in 473 loci. Nevertheless, the present result was far from developing pseudomolecules in the bitter gourd genome, since many scaffolds remained to be assigned on this linkage map. Considering the limited genetic diversity in bitter gourd lines, it might be difficult to increase marker density; thus, improving scaffold length by using a different assembly procedure and/or long read sequencing method such as PacBio, is necessary for completing its genome sequence analysis.3.7. Orthologous genes for sex determinationCucurbit crops are suitable models for elucidating sex determination in monoecious plant species.42 Since genes for sex determination have been identified in melon and cucumber, their orthologous genes were further explored in other Cucurbitaceae crops by BLAST searching, including bitter gourd. CmAcs11, encoding ACC synthase, responsible for female flower determination in melon.43 An additional ACC synthase gene, CmAcs-7,44 was also shown to regulate unisexual flower development in melon and putative orthologous genes were identified in related species. Amino acid sequences of these ACC synthases in cucurbits (Supplementary Table S12) were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was created including genes in Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup (Supplementary Fig. S6A). CmAcs-7 and its homologous proteins in cucurbits were phylogenetically distant from CmAcs11 and its homologs, suggesting the differentiation of these two ACC synthases. According to this analysis, the MOMC3_649 in bitter gourd (Supplementary Fig. S6A) was presumed to be an ortholog of CmAcs11. Two proteins similar to CmAcs-7 (MOMC46_189, MOMC518_1) were found in bitter gourd (Supplementary Fig. S6A), and grouped in the same clade in the phylogenetic tree.As the gene for male determination, CmWip1, encoding the zinc-finger domain protein, was identified in melon.45 Its putative orthologous genes were also searched in the genome of other Cucurbitaceae species and their phylogenetic relationship was also analyzed based on amino acid sequences of their encoded proteins as described above (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In this analysis, MOMC52-27 in bitter gourd (Supplementary Fig. S6B) was assumed to be an ortholog of CmWip1. These results showed that orthologous genes for known sex determination genes in melon or cucumber were also present in bitter gourd.RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7) demonstrated that MOMC518_1g(encoding CmAcs-7-like protein) and MOMC3_649g (encoding CmAcs11-like protein) were expressed in female flowers of bitter gourd plants more preferentially than male flower buds. This was in agreement with previous observations in melon or cucumbers, where both ACS11 and ACS-7 or ACS2 were highly expressed in female flower buds.43 Another gene encoding CmAcs-7-like protein in bitter gourd, MOMC46_89g, did not show specific expression in flower buds. Expression of the genes for MOMC52_27g (encoding CmWip1-like protein) was confirmed in flower buds, but significant differential expression among analyzed tissues was not observed, which was inconsistent with its male flower-specific expression in melon or cucumber.45 As shown by Switzenberg et al.46 in melon, specific expression of ACS gene in petal and stamen induced alternation of sex phenotype by ethylene production. Therefore, to elucidate functions in the sex determination of candidate genes in bitter gourd, their spatiotemporal expression patterns should be analyzed in flower buds.In Momordica, dioecious species, such as M. dioica or M. cochinchinensis, are also known. According to molecular phylogenetics, an African ancestor of Momordica species was predicted to be dioecious, and several conversions between dioecy and monoecy have occurred during its speciation and distribution from Africa to Asia.47 In M. dioica, it was suggested that ethylene was responsible for sex determination,48 although sex determination genes were undetermined. Therefore, molecular genetic studies of sex determination in Momordica species, including bitter gourd, will reveal the evolution of dioecy and monoecy. Boualem et al., succeeded in establishing dioecious mating system in melon by combining alleles of CmAcs11 and CmWip1.43,47 However, it was difficult to consider that these two independent genes had concerned to frequent conversion between monoecy and dioecy in Momordica species.5.

Since MIR elements ceased to amplify ~130 myr ago, previous studies primarily focused on their genomic impact, while the issue of their expression has not been extensively addressed. We applied a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to ENCODE RNA-Seq datasets of seven human cell lines and, for the first time, we were able to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single-locus resolution. While the majority of Pol III-transcribed MIR elements are cell-specific, we discovered a small set of ubiquitously transcribed MIRs mapping within Pol II-transcribed genes in antisense orientation that could influence the expression of the overlapping gene. We also identified novel Pol III-transcribed ncRNAs, deriving from transcription of annotated MIR fragments flanked by unique MIR-unrelated sequences, and confirmed the role of Pol III-specific internal promoter elements in MIR transcription. Besides demonstrating widespread transcription at these retrotranspositionally inactive elements in human cells, the ability to profile MIR expression at single-locus resolution will facilitate their study in different cell types and states including pathological alterations.1. IntroductionMammalian-wide Interspersed Repeats (MIRs) represent an ancient family of tRNA-derived Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) found in all mammalian genomes, whose amplification seems to have ceased in the ancestors of placental mammals.1–3 This is in contrast with Alu elements, the most abundant SINEs, which are still transpositionally active.4 It is thought that MIRs may have arisen following the fusion of a tRNA molecule with the 3'-end of an existing Long INterspersed Element (LINE).5 The complete MIR element is about 260 bp in length and comprises a tRNA-related 5' head, a 70-bp conserved central domain containing a 15-bp core sequence, and a LINE-related sequence located at the 3'-end5 (Fig. 1). In an earlier study first describing MIRs, two segments overlapping with the LINE-related region were described as separate interspersed repeats MER24 and DBR.2Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideRepresentation of the structure of a mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR).

Pol III is expected to terminate at the first encountered termination signal (Tn) which may be located at varying distances from the end of the MIR body.MIR elements were actively propagating prior to the radiation of mammals and before placental mammals separated. For this reason their age was originally estimated to be ~130 million years (myr) even if it has been suggested that the CORE-SINE6 may have originated ~550 myr ago due to the remarkable similarity between Ther-1 (the MIR consensus in placental mammals which corresponds to that revealed earlier in humans) and the OR2 SINE of octopuses.7 Intriguingly, there are observations suggesting that the core region may serve some general function in mammalian genomes, because the level of sequence conservation is higher than the 3' and 5'-flanking sequences.8In the human genome, there are more than 500,000 annotated MIRs.9 Based on their sequence similarity, they have been grouped into 4 subfamilies named MIR, MIRb, MIRc, and MIR3. Like all SINEs, MIRs are thought to be transcribed by the RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) machinery, with the assembly factor TFIIIC recognizing the A- and B-box internal control regions within the tRNA-derived portion of the element.2 As well established for tRNA gene promoters, once bound TFIIIC recruits TFIIIB [composed of Brf1, Bdp1 and the TATA box-binding protein (TBP)], which in turn recruits Pol III.10 The first experimental verifications of MIRs as Pol III targets in the human genome have come from the results of genome-wide location analyses of the Pol III machinery in human11,12 and mouse cells.13,14 Interestingly, one of these studies revealed that, in human immortalized fibroblasts, the Pol III machinery is consistently associated with a MIR located in the first intron of the POLR3E gene, coding for a specific subunit of Pol III (RPC5). A significant enrichment of components of the Pol III machinery was also observed at a dozen other MIRs, thus supporting the notion that MIRs, although transpositionally inactive, can undergo autonomous transcription.11,13,14Unlike Alus that, although non-autonomous in retrotransposition, nevertheless exploit the LINE-encoded machinery to amplify in the genome, MIRs have ceased to amplify by retrotransposition ~130 Myr ago. This could be due to many reasons, including for example the inactivation of L2 (the partner LINE for MIR elements) or mutations in LINE-related regions of MIRs. Nevertheless, it can be speculated that since part of these elements are still transcriptionally active at least in the human and mouse genome,11 changes in the 3' tail due to sequence mutations could potentially rescue the retrotransposition potential of some of them. Recent studies have shown that enhancers are a platform from which MIRs can exert a regulatory function in the human genome9 and that MIRs can also serve as insulators acting as chromatin barriers or enhancer-blocking elements.15 Nothing is known, however, about the possible involvement of MIR expression in their role at enhancers/insulators. In general, in spite of some advancement in our knowledge of how the massive presence of MIRs impacts genome biology, their contribution to the human transcriptome is still largely unexplored, as are their transcription mechanism and regulation. In particular, the cis-acting elements controlling MIR transcription have never been systematically studied.In this study, by applying a recently developed bioinformatics pipeline to ENCODE RNA-seq data, we define for the first time the MIR expression profiles of human cells, and we investigate on the in cis requirements for MIR transcription by biochemical analysis in vitro.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bioinformatic pipeline for MIR expressionFor MIR RNA identification we used the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) long RNA-seq data within ENCODE16 of seven human cell lines (GM12878, H1-hESC, HeLa-S3, HepG2, HUVEC, K562, and NHEK). The RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37/hg19 as previously described.17 PolyA+ and PolyA- datasets (bam files) were merged to streamline the analyses. We were not interested in the differences between these two features because MIR RNAs usually do not have a poly(A) tail.The bam files from each dataset, containing RNA-Seq reads aligned to the reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using TopHat aligner, along with the annotated MIRs, were submitted to a Python script that performs the identification of individual MIR transcripts. The script first builds stranded coverage vectors for the whole genome, using the bam file supplied and only considering uniquely mapped reads (tag NH:i:1 in the bam file). Then, for each annotated MIR having an expression coverage value over a calculated background noise threshold, the script calculates the coordinates of the corresponding expected full-length consensus element (see Supplementary Methods), to take into account the fact that many of the annotated MIR elements are truncated. Finally a flanking region filter is applied to the identified expected full-length element, as described in Supplementary Methods, in order to exclude false positives arising from MIR elements embedded in Pol II transcripts. The filter is designed to do this by imposing a significantly lower expression coverage value to the flanking regions immediately upstream and downstream of the expected full-length SINE, thus discriminating between genuine SINE RNAs and those that are ‘passengers’ of longer Pol II transcripts or part of their trailers extending downstream of their annotated 3'UTRs. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the pipeline, which is improved with respect to the one previously employed to distinguish genuine from ‘passenger’ Alu RNAs17 allowing us to control each step and to identify both Alu and MIR transcripts of the SINE class of retrotransposons.

Shown is a flow diagram of the improved bioinformatic pipeline for the identification of autonomously expressed SINE loci from RNA-seq data sets. See text and Supplementary Methods for details.Only MIRs which passed the final filter of the pipeline in both ENCODE RNA-Seq replicates were considered to represent autonomously expressed MIR loci and will be referred to as ‘expression-positive’. The complete list of expression-positive MIRs are reported in Supplementary Table S1.To further support the identification of unique MIR transcripts found in Hela-S3 and K562 cells we intersected the ChIP-seq peak data from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/) and Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) from ENCODE data uniformly processed by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wg EncodeRegTfbsClustered/wgEncodeReg TfbsClustered WithCells V3.bed.gz) for some Pol III transcription factors (TFs) binding sites with the coordinates of the expected full-length expression-positive MIRs, extended to 200 bp upstream. To identify other Pol II TFs associated with expression-positive MIR elements, we intersected, for each cell line, the 500 bp upstream of the expected full-length MIRs with the coordinates of the TF binding sites from ENCODE data, also uniformly processed by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group. The lists of Pol III-associated expression-positive MIRs and of those associated with other TFs are reported in Supplementary Table S2.2.2. Plasmid constructionFour human MIR loci (whose chromosome coordinates are reported in Table 3), together with their 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table S4. Constructs containing a targeted mutation of the B box internal control element were generated as described previously.17 Upstream deletion constructs employed forward PCR primers generating amplicons truncated at position -25 with respect to MIR A box at the 5'-end. Truncated amplicons were inserted into pGEM®-T Easy and the constructs selected for in vitro transcription contained the 5'-truncated insert in the same orientation as their wild-type MIR counterpart, to minimize the influence of vector sequence on transcription efficiency. 2.3. In vitro transcriptionAll recombinant plasmids for in vitro transcription reactions were purified with the Qiagen Plasmid Mini kit (Qiagen). Reaction mixtures (final volume: 25 µl) contained 500 ng of template DNA, 70 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 5 mM phosphocreatine, 2 µg/ml alpha-amanitin, 0.4 U/µl SUPERase-In (Ambion) as RNase inhibitor, 40 µg of HeLa cell nuclear extract,18 0.5 mM each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.025 mM UTP and 5µCi of [a-32P]UTP (Perkin-Elmer). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30 °C before being stopped by the addition of 75 µl of nuclease-free water and 100 µl of phenol:chloroform (1:1) pH 5.5. Purified labeled RNA products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and visualized, and quantified with a Cyclone Phosphor Imager (PerkinElmer) and the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).2.3. AvailabilityThe Python script allowing to identify individual MIR transcripts is available at the following URL: https://github.com/davidecarnevali/SINEsFind.3. Results3.1. A bioinformatic pipeline for the identification of transcriptionally active MIR loci from RNA-Seq datasetsTo leverage the potential of our previous work,17 we developed a pipeline in order to improve the identification of Pol III SINE transcripts (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Methods). We focused on the identification of MIR transcripts by applying the improved pipeline to the aligned Long RNA-Seq reads from ENCODE,17 considering for analysis a subset of the annotated MIR elements from the GRCh37/hg19 UCSC RepeatMasker track classified according to their genomic location: (i) MIRs mapping in intergenic regions (i.e. outside RefSeq, Ensembl, and lincRNA genes), (ii) MIRs mapping within RefSeq, Ensembl, and lincRNA genes but in antisense orientation, and (iii) MIRs fully contained within introns of RefSeq, Ensembl, and lincRNA genes in sense orientation and not overlapping with any exon. We refer to the first two groups together as ‘intergenic/antisense’.Figure 2 provides a schematic representation of our improved pipeline. The main improvements with respect to the previously described pipeline17 consist in the estimation of the ‘background’ coverage signal for each sample (instead using a fixed value for all the samples) and the definition of the flanking regions based on the global alignment of each annotated element with its consensus sequence (See Materials and Methods and Supplementary Methods).3.2. General features of MIR transcriptomes emerging from ENCODE RNA-seq data analysisA preliminary survey of the expression coverage of the MIR loci identified as expression-positive showed us both convincing MIR transcription profiles and less clearcut ones with noise background signals upstream and downstream of the MIR element probably deriving from the sequencing of introns or unknown Pol II transcripts. Even the latter cases, however, displayed expression coverage enrichment in the region of the annotated MIR element, suggesting the possibility of autonomous Pol III transcription as a pathway for their biogenesis, perhaps occurring in parallel with Pol II transcription of the host gene with intron-containing MIR RNAs generated by processing from longer Pol II transcripts. Since the tendency to high noise-to-background signals is more frequently observed in MIR element mapping within introns of Pol II genes in sense orientation, which constitute 79% of the expression-positive MIRs (see Supplementary Table S1), we decided to mainly focus on the expression of intergenic/antisense MIRs, while a few examples of gene-hosted sense-oriented MIRs will be addressed later in the Results section.The full list of MIRs identified as expression-positive by our search strategy is reported in Supplementary Table S1. As summarized in Table 1 each of the cell lines expressed a limited number of MIR elements (ranging from 145 in the case of GM12878 cells to 435 in the case of HUVEC cells). Of the whole set of 1301 expression-positive MIR loci a small percentage (~21%) were intergenic/antisense, which is in contrast with the global distribution of all the annotated MIRs regardless of their expression where the percentage of the intergenic/antisense MIRs is much higher (~68%) (see Supplementary Table S1). A significant fraction (~39%) of intergenic/antisense MIRs mapped in antisense orientation to annotated Pol II-transcribed genes. For comparison, the fraction of intergenic/antisense expression-positive Alus mapping in antisense orientation to the overlapping genes in the same cell lines was only 22%,17 suggesting that MIRs antisense to Pol II genes could have a more specific role, possibly correlated with the regulation of the overlapping gene. A small fraction (~20%) of all the expression-positive MIRs were found to be expressed in more than one cell line (see Supplementary Table S1), while this percentage decreased to 12% considering only the intergenic/antisense MIRs (Table 1). This suggests a marked cell line specificity in MIR expression (even though few MIRs seem to be ubiquitously expressed as will be further reported below) greater than the one found for Alu expression where the fraction of expression-positive Alus expressed in more than one cell line was higher (~24%).17Statistic of expression-positive MIR elements in selected cell linesaFor each cell line, the column reports the number of MIRs considered as autonomously expressed in both ENCODE RNA-seq replicates.bFor each cell line, the column reports the number of intergenic/antisense MIRs that are also expressed in one or more different cell lines.cReported in this column are the numbers of intergenic MIRs mapping with an antisense orientation to either protein-coding, non protein-coding or lincRNA genes.dThe numbers in this raw refer to individual MIRs expressed in one or more cell lines.Statistic of expression-positive MIR elements in selected cell linesaFor each cell line, the column reports the number of MIRs considered as autonomously expressed in both ENCODE RNA-seq replicates.bFor each cell line, the column reports the number of intergenic/antisense MIRs that are also expressed in one or more different cell lines.cReported in this column are the numbers of intergenic MIRs mapping with an antisense orientation to either protein-coding, non protein-coding or lincRNA genes.dThe numbers in this raw refer to individual MIRs expressed in one or more cell lines.As summarized in Table 2, no significant under- or over-representation of any particular MIR subfamily within the set of expressed MIRs was observed (see Supplementary Table S1).

Survey of expressed MIRs according to location and base-resolution expression profileThe ~6 × 105 annotated MIRs are not all complete in sequence, and represent only a portion of the canonical full-length MIR element. Among expression-positive MIRs, we found both complete and incomplete elements and, correspondingly, three main types of base-resolution expression profiles: (i) full-length or almost full-length MIRs (Fig. 3A and B), covered by sequence reads along all their extension; (ii) incomplete MIRs representing either the left or the right portion of the canonical full-length MIR but whose transcript coverage tends to correspond to the one of a fully transcribed canonical MIR [more specifically, transcript coverage tends to extend into the downstream MIR-unrelated region for incomplete MIRs lacking the 3' moiety (Fig. 3C), while it tends to start in an upstream MIR-unrelated region, possessing functional A and B-boxes, for incomplete MIRs lacking the 5' moiety (Fig. 3E)]; (iii) incomplete MIRs lacking the 3' moiety (thus containing A and B boxes) and producing transcripts that do not extend outside of the MIR sequence (Fig. 3D).

It also displayed a specific, yet very low coverage, below the threshold for a positive score, in H1-hESC, HeLa-S3, HepG2, and NHEK cells. This representative MIR is full-length and maps to intron 6 or 7 (depending on which transcript isoform is considered) of the NPAS3 gene, in antisense orientation. It has an expression profile that almost entirely covers the annotated element with uniquely mapped sequence reads. The double-humped expression coverage profiles shown in Figure 3 are due to cDNA size selection during library preparation and sequencing specifications, as previously reported.17 A- and B- boxes are conserved at 13 and 50 bp downstream of the TSS, respectively. Unusually, the annotated MIR contains a strong termination signal (T4) in its sequence 104 nt from the beginning of the element, which is clearly skipped by the Pol III machinery, given the coverage signal in the downstream moiety of the element. We investigated the possibility that the genomes of the cell lines analyzed had a sequence variation with respect to the reference GRCh37/hg19 sequence, in correspondence of these Pol III strong terminators. To this end, we reconstructed the corresponding consensus genome sequences from RNA sequence reads (see Supplementary Methods). We did not find any sequence variant, thus indicating the presence of a termination signal skipped by the Pol III machinery. Another terminator of 4Ts is present in the downstream moiety of the MIR, leading to a transcript of ~220 nt. Strong support for the genuine nature of this Pol III-derived MIR RNA comes from the association with this locus of the Pol III subunit RPC155 in K562 cells (Fig. 3A).Figure 3B shows a MIR fully contained within an intron of the PAMR1 gene in the sense orientation that has been found to be expressed in 5 cell lines. The Pol III-dependent character of this transcription unit is supported by its association with the Pol III subunit RPC155 and the Pol III transcription factor BDP1 in K562 and HeLa cell lines, also confirming the ability of Pol III machinery complex to access and transcribe Pol II genomic loci.Reported in Figure 3C is the transcript coverage profile of an incomplete MIR element of 159 bp (chr16:22309780-22309939 MIR_dup2285), which was expressed in all 7 cell lines. This element aligns to the left portion of the MIR consensus sequence, but its transcription continues downstream of the region annotated as MIR (in orange in Fig. 3C) for ~200 nt before encountering a non-canonical termination signal (T3CT). This previously characterized MIR11 is located in antisense orientation in the first intron of the POLR3E gene, encoding a subunit (RPC5) of human RNA polymerase III. Its transcription by Pol III is supported by the presence of canonical A- and B-boxes as well as by association with components of the Pol III machinery in HeLa-S3 and K562 cell lines. Here, again, the annotated MIR portion contains a strong termination signal (T4) early in its sequence, 121 nt downstream the 5' end of the element. Another potential terminator is located 82 nt downstream of the 3' end of the annotated element. In this case, the coverage signal tends to decrease temporarily but slightly increases again downstream, until a non-canonical terminator is encountered. The skipping of the first terminator by Pol III is supported by the expression coverage levels upstream and downstream, which are almost the same, strongly suggesting that they arise from the same transcript. In contrast, lower coverage downstream of the second terminator suggests the occurrence of only limited read through of this termination signal by Pol III. We also considered the possibility of a mutation in the strong terminator sequences in the DNA of these cells (see above), but we did not find any sequence variant, thus confirming the ability of Pol III to skip strong terminator signals within certain sequence contexts.19 This result was partially confirmed by in vitro transcription analysis (see Fig. 5).In Figure 3D, we report a MIR element (chr17:17863550-17863651 MIRb_dup1281), found to be expressed at low levels in in H1-hESC cell line, originating from an incomplete MIR element antisense to the TOM1L2 gene. By inspecting the coverage profile in other cell lines, we could find signals of much lower expression in at least one replicate of each of the analyzed cell lines. The source element of this transcript corresponds to a MIRb left fragment carrying in its sequence functional A- and B- boxes. The transcript coverage precisely spans the length of the annotated element up to a strong terminator (T10) right at the end of it, leading to a transcript of ~100 nt.Figure 3E shows a MIR, found as expression-positive in H1-hESC, K562 and NHEK cell lines, whose transcription initiates in an upstream MIR-unrelated region (chr14:89445565-89445634 MIRc_dup2189) and ends ~50 nt downstream of the annotated element corresponding with a strong termination signal (T5). By inspecting the MIR-unrelated upstream region we found canonical A- and B- boxes, indicating that this MIR element, lacking Pol III promoters in its sequence, is transcribed from an upstream MIR-unrelated region providing functional control elements. Also in this case we noted a termination signal (T3AT4) at the beginning of the annotated element which seems to be (partially) skipped in vivo by Pol III (as for MIR_dup2285 in POLR3E gene in Fig. 3C) and is located right at the end of the first coverage hump. Indeed the second hump has a slightly lower coverage signal (at least in H1-hESC and NHEK cells) suggesting a shorter primary transcript as confirmed by in vitro transcription (see below). The binding of Pol III TFs throughout this region in K562 cells, together with the transcript coverage profile, strongly support the Pol III-dependence of this MIR transcript.As a further note on the MIR in Figure 3C, a Polr3e antisense-oriented MIR with the same location and similar sequence of MIR_dup2285 is also present in the mouse genome, where it has also been shown to be transcriptionally active, and to be associated with an unusual second point accumulation of RNA Pol II, in addition to the expected one in the Polr3e promoter, which abuts precisely on the Pol III occupancy peak reflecting MIR transcription on the opposite strand.14 These observations, along with the fact that this MIR is conserved in human and mouse, led the authors to hypothesize a functional role of this MIR in POLR3E gene regulation. We therefore asked if this second RNA Pol II accumulation point also occurs in the ENCODE cell lines, and found Pol II peaks for all 7 cell types (see Supplementary Table S5) thus strengthening the hypothesis that this transcriptionally active MIR plays a regulatory role in Pol II transcription of POLR3E. Figure 4 shows Pol II in three of the seven cell lines along with the Pol III signals. Figure 4Open in new tabDownload slideSimultaneous Pol III and Pol II accumulation signals at MIR_dup2285.

Fig. 3C).Finally, we asked if there was a correlation between the expression of the 78 MIRs overlapping with Pol II protein-coding genes in antisense orientation and the expression of the overlapping genes themselves. To this end, we compared normalized read counts of the MIRs in each replicate with those of the overlapping Pol II genes using the Pearson correlation coefficient (See Supplementary Methods) and found only positive correlation (r > 0.7 with P  < 10 - 5) for few genes (ARHGEF3, DSCAM, GNA15, JAKMIP2, LRP2, NBPF10, PLXDC2, TMEM177) (data not shown). We also asked whether the protein-coding genes characterized by the presence of intronic MIRs (mapping in either antisense or sense orientation) are enriched in any particular gene ontology functional category. Interestingly, we found a strong enrichment (P < 10 - 139) for genes producing multiple proteins due to alternative splicing, suggesting a possible influence of intronic MIRs on this process. When expression-positive MIR only were considered, such a GO enrichment was less marked, although still remarkable (P value 1.8 × 10 - 24).3.4. Association of the Pol III machinery with expression-positive MIRsBefore the use of RNA-Seq data to help identify expression-positive SINEs, genome-wide studies based on ChIP-Seq approaches were used in humans and mouse models with the aim of producing inventories of loci inferred to be transcribed by Pol III from their association with one or more component of the Pol III machinery.11,12,14,20,21 Such studies revealed a limited number of Pol III-associated SINE elements, and most of them were Alus. The availability of genome-wide ChIP-Seq data from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard (SYDH) and from ENCODE data uniformly processed by the ENCODE Analysis Working Group for key components of Pol III transcription machinery (BDP1, BRF1/2, RPC155, and TFIIIC110) allowed us to readdress this issue, by investigating whether a significant enrichment of these TFs could be found in the expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs of HeLa and K562 cells. Supplementary Table S2 lists the expression positive MIRs found to be associated with Pol III components in HeLa and K562 cells. In HeLa cells, of the 32 intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs, only 5 were found associated with one or more Pol III TFs. The three transcription components whose association was found to be statistically significant, with a P  < 5.5x10 - 5 (calculated using Fisher’s exact test), were BDP1, TFIIIC-110 and RPC155 when considering the fraction of the intergenic/antisense expressed MIRs against the total intergenic/antisense annotated ones. When the Pol III component association with the 156 intron-hosted sense oriented expression positive MIRs was investigated, only one (MIR_dup2691 reported in Fig. 3B) was found associated with the Pol III subunit RPC155. When K562 cells were considered, a higher percentage (36%, 15 MIRs) of intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs where found bound by one or more Pol III components, while the percentage drop down to 3% (4 MIRs) when considering the 119 MIRs fully contained within introns of Pol II genes in sense orientation (data not shown). In K562 cells we found significant enrichment for BDP1, TFIIIC110 and RPC155 (P values 5.2 × 10 - 9, 9.7 × 10 - 6 and <2.2 × 10 - 16, respectively) in intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs. It is interesting to compare these results with those previously reported for Alus.17 K562 cells were found to have a higher number of Alu loci bound to components of the Pol III machinery complex than HeLa cells, thus suggesting a more permissive environment for Pol III association in K562 cells. The lower percentage of Pol III-associated elements among intronic sense-oriented expression-positive MIRs suggests that their expression is Pol II-dependent in most cases.Interestingly the MIR antisense to POLR3E, expressed in all 7 cell lines, is the one bound by the highest number of Pol III TFs in both HeLa and K562 cells (BDP1, BRF1, TFIIIC-110, RPC155) thus further confirming its genuine character of Pol III transcription unit.3.5. Association of expression-positive MIRs with TFsIn order to assess whether the upstream region of MIR elements could influence their transcription through TFs specifically interacting with it, we took advantage of the availability of ChIP-Seq data for several TFs within ENCODE datasets. We asked if intergenic/antisense MIRs identified as expressed through our pipeline tend to be associated with one or more Pol II TFs, in addition to the known components of the Pol III machinery. The results of this analysis are reported in detail in Supplementary Table S2. Highly variable TFs associations were observed among the 7 cell lines, both in terms of the total number of TF-bound MIRs (ranging from 7 to 21) and in terms of the number of TFs associated to each MIR, mostly depending on the number of available TF ChIP-seq data for each cell line (ranging from 3 in NHEK cells to 100 in K562 cells). Among the Pol II-related transcription proteins most significantly associated with expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs we found RNA polymerase II itself (POLR2A), TBP, MAX, MAZ, and YY1 (Supplementary Table S3). HeLa, HUVEC and NHEK cell lines are those with the lowest number of TFs being measured by ChIP-seq and therefore have very low numbers of intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs bound by TFs and with no significant enrichment.3.6. Expression-positive MIRs and chromatin statesA recent study, showing that MIR elements are highly enriched in the enhancer state of chromatin in K562 and HeLa cell lines9 prompted us to investigate whether our intergenic/antisense expression-positive MIRs found in the same cell lines were among those found by this study. We intersected the coordinates of our expression-positive MIRs with those of the MIR elements found to be enriched in enhancers (lifted over from NCBI36/hg18 to GRCh37/hg19), but we found only one overlapping MIR among the fully intronic sense-oriented dataset. We also tested for enrichment in the enhancer states of expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs by using the ENCODE Chromatin State Segmentation data. A Fisher’s exact test was performed against all the other annotated intergenic/antisense MIRs used in the pipeline. We found significant enrichment only in Gm12878 and HUVEC cell line in strong enhancer state (P values 6.35e - 06 and 1.08e - 05, respectively) (Supplementary Table S5). Extending the test to the fully intronic sense-oriented expression-positive MIRs, we did not find any significant enrichment in any of the seven cell lines.Considering the results from another study15 which shows that MIR sequences provide insulators in the genome of CD4+ T cells, we verified if any of our expression-positive MIRs found in all the seven cell lines analysed were among the MIR-derived insulators, but we found only three overlaps. Again, we decided to check if our expression-positive MIRs were enriched in the insulator state of chromatin but we found very few not statistically significant (using Fisher’s exact test) overlaps between the coordinates of our expression-positive MIRs, both intergenic/antisense (no overlaps) and fully intronic sense-oriented (one in GM12878, two in H1-hESC, three in HepG2, and two in NHEK cell lines), and those of genomic regions marked as insulators in ENCODE Chromatin State Segmentation by HMM data (data not shown).3.7. In vitro transcription analysis of expressed MIR elementsOur bioinformatic pipeline permitted us to detect in vivo expression of individual MIR elements that could be transcribed by the Pol III machinery. To confirm Pol III transcription and make a precise promoter characterization of these transcriptional units, we conducted their in vitro transcription in a HeLa nuclear extract. We focused our attention on a small subset of MIR loci, which are expressed in at least three cell types (listed in Table 3). One of them is MIR_dup2285 (chr16:22309780-22309939), expressed in all the seven investigated ENCODE cell lines and associated with at least 3 components of the Pol III machinery in both HeLa-S3 and K562 cells (see Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S2). Another locus subjected to in vitro transcription analysis, MIR_dup3493 (chr1: 34943459-34943727), was found to be expressed in four cells lines (GM12878, H1-hESC, K562 and NHEK) and has A- and B- boxes perfectly matching the consensus.22 The remaining two in vitro tested loci (MIRb_dup5848 chr2:71762977-71763215 and MIRc_dup2189 chr14:89445565-89445634) were found to be expressed in at least three cell types (GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG2, NHEK and H1-hESC, K562, NHEK respectively). Based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data, only MIRc_dup2189 is associated with two components of the Pol III machinery (RPC155 and BDP1). MIRs subjected to in vitro transcription analysisaThe column lists, for each MIR element, the cell lines in which it was found to be expressed by ENCODE RNA-seq data analysis.bThe reported transcript lengths were calculated by assuming as TSS the A or G residue closest to the position 12 bp upstream of the A box. To estimate the 3’ end of the transcript, both canonical (Tn with n = 4) and non-canonical T-rich Pol III terminators [17] were considered both within and downstream of MIR body sequence (indicated in parentheses after the transcript length). For canonical terminators, the four Us corresponding to the first four Ts of the termination signal were considered as part of the transcripts; for non-canonical terminators, all the nucleotides of the terminator were considered as incorporated into the RNA. In the case of MIR_dup2285, for which two possible A boxes could drive transcription, the expected lengths of both putative alternative transcripts are indicated (Supplementary Fig. S1).MIRs subjected to in vitro transcription analysisaThe column lists, for each MIR element, the cell lines in which it was found to be expressed by ENCODE RNA-seq data analysis.bThe reported transcript lengths were calculated by assuming as TSS the A or G residue closest to the position 12 bp upstream of the A box.

In the case of MIR_dup2285, for which two possible A boxes could drive transcription, the expected lengths of both putative alternative transcripts are indicated (Supplementary Fig. S1).The above MIRs were transcribed in vitro using a HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of a-amanitin (2 µg/ml) to completely inhibit RNA polymerase II activity (Fig. 5). Transcription reactions were also programmed in parallel with two mutant versions of each MIR element: one in which the B-box internal promoter element was inactivated by site-specific mutagenesis, and the other in which the upstream flanking region was deleted. Control transcription reactions were set with empty pGEM-T-Easy plasmid (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 10) and the same vector carrying either a previously characterized Alu (AluSq2 chr1:61523296–61523586)17 (lanes 2 and 11) or a tRNAVal (AAC) gene (TRNAV18, chr6) (lanes 3 and 12) whose transcription produces three different primary transcripts (of 87, 112 and 142 nt) because of heterogeneous termination at one of three consecutive termination signals.19 Each of the tested MIR elements produced a distinct pattern of transcription, in which the sizes of the most abundant transcripts agreed with those predicted on the basis of sequence inspection of the Pol III termination signals, either canonical (a run of at least four Ts) or non-canonical, both internal and in the 3'-flanking region (see Table 3). In particular, the MIR_dup2285 transcription unit has a predicted non-canonical terminator (T3CT) ~200 bp downstream the 3' end of the annotated element, as well as two strong early terminators, along with another non-canonical terminator, that seems to be skipped by the Pol III machinery (Supplementary Fig. S1). The first strong terminator (T4) is located within the annotated element 121 nt from the start coordinate, while the other one (T4), located 240 nt downstream of the 5' end, is downstream of the annotated element but still within the corresponding expected full-length MIR. As shown in Figure 5 (lane 4) all four transcripts, corresponding to the four termination signals, are identified during in vitro transcription, supporting the hypothesis of terminator skipping by Pol III. However it is worth noting that the most abundant signal arises from the transcript ending at the first strong Pol III terminator, suggesting a reduced tendency of the Pol III machinery complex to skip terminators of this MIR in vitro than in vivo (see profile in Fig. 3C). A fifth transcript, migrating between 112 nt and 142 nt markers, is also identified as likely corresponding to a transcript ending at the first strong terminator but using an alternative A-box (see Table 3).

Indicated by arrows on the gel image are the migration positions (with lengths) of bands corresponding to the expected transcripts in Table 3.The global transcription outputs of the four MIRs were roughly comparable (cf. lanes 4, 7, 13, and 16) indicating that their varying expression levels in cultured cells are not due to differences in cis-acting elements recognized by the basal Pol III transcription machinery. When the MIR B-box was mutationally inactivated (by substituting CG for the invariant TC dinucleotide of the B box consensus sequence GWTCRAnnC), a clear reduction in MIR transcription efficiency was observed in each case, thus confirming the importance of this element for MIR transcription. Remarkably, however, in no case was transcription abolished by B box inactivation. This was most evident for MIR_dup2285, whose B box-independent transcription was only 2.4-fold less than full transcription (cf. lanes 4 and 16). These data demonstrate that MIRs are efficiently transcribed by Pol III and confirms a key role for B box recognition by TFIIIC, even though the appreciable levels of residual transcription observed with B box-mutated MIRs provide evidence of a key role of A box (and possibly of 5'-flanking region) as a core promoter element in the assembly of the basal transcription machinery, even in the absence of a B box, as previously observed for other Pol III-transcribed genes in yeast.23To understand if upstream regions influence MIR transcription as they do in the case of Alus,17 we compared the in vitro transcriptional activity of the four isolated MIRs with that of the corresponding 5'-deletion mutants. As shown in Figure 5, upstream sequence deletion negatively affected transcription to different extents for the different MIRs. Transcription of upstream deleted MIRs was reduced by 1.8- to 2.5-fold in the case of MIR_dup2285, MIR_dup3493 and MIRb_dup5848 (cf. lanes 4, 7, and 13 with lanes 6, 9 and 15, respectively), while it was only moderately reduced (~1.3-fold) in the case of MIRc_dup2189 (cf. lanes 16 with 18). Overall these data reveal that MIR transcription is generally influenced by the upstream region, albeit at a lower extent than Alu transcription.DiscussionThis work provides, for the first time, a comprehensive account of transcriptionally active MIR loci in human cells and identifies MIR-derived transcripts representing novel ncRNAs in which a MIR fragment is fused with a MIR-unrelated, unique sequence. It also confirms the existence of ubiquitously transcribed MIR elements that could play a role in the regulation of their Pol II-transcribed overlapping genes.The analysis of publicly available ENCODE RNA-seq datasets using an improved bioinformatic pipeline derived from our previous work17 allowed us to define the Pol III-driven MIR transcriptome at single locus resolution using a search strategy that worked well especially for intergenic/antisense MIRs, whose coverage expression profiles where less biased than in the case of intronic sense MIRs by signals arising from sequencing of unknown ncRNA or hnRNA introns.While a few previous studies on MIR elements focused on their genomic role as regulatory sequences, none of them tried to asses MIR expression in vivo, presumably because the only known role of MIR transcripts was that of retrotransposition and they ceased to amplify ~130 myr ago.2 The only previous experimental evidence of MIR transcription by Pol III in mammals consists of the results of genome-wide localization analyses of the Pol III machinery in human cells11,12 and in mouse.13,14 Our results reveal that MIR elements, although retrotranspositionally inactive, are widely transcribed and thus contribute to the ncRNA transcriptome of human cells.Pol III transcription of MIRs occurs extensively both in intergenic regions and within introns of Pol II genes both in antisense and sense orientation. Pol III thus generates a MIR transcriptome composed mainly of cell-specific transcripts and, to a lesser extent, of a tiny subset of MIR-derived RNAs expressed in more than one cell line. Many of the observed MIR-derived transcripts arise from complete MIR elements that are transcribed along their entire length. However, we also found frequent cases of expressed MIRs corresponding to the left or right portion of the canonical full-length MIR whose transcription gives rise to chimeric RNAs composed of a MIR portion fused with a MIR-unrelated unique sequence from the genomic moiety downstream or upstream of the annotated MIR fragment. The genuine, Pol III-dependent character of expression-positive intergenic/antisense MIRs identified by our analysis is supported by their statistically significant enrichment of associated Pol III components within ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets for HeLa-S3 and K562 cells.As previously observed for Alus, we confirm the ability of the Pol III machinery to access SINE elements located in genomic regions transcribed by Pol II, both in the sense and antisense orientation, suggesting the possibility that Pol III-dependent MIR transcription might contribute to the regulation of the overlapping Pol II-transcribed genes. On the other hand, the high percentage of expression-positive MIRs within introns of both protein-coding and noncoding Pol II genes in antisense orientation (see Table 1) might explain their significant association with components of the Pol II machinery (see supplementary Tables S2–S3) and strengthens the notion of a close, functionally relevant association of Pol II and its TFs with Pol III genes.24Particularly intriguing in this respect is the MIR element located within the first intron of POLR3E gene. This MIR was found to be expression-positive in all the seven cell lines we analyzed, and its intronic location within this gene appears to be conserved in mouse and other mammals (data not shown). Furthermore, its Pol III transcription is conserved at least in mouse.14 This MIR produces a chimeric transcript containing a MIR-unrelated downstream moiety, and its Pol III transcription is confirmed by the high number of associated Pol III components (see Fig. 3C). Since the POLR3E gene codes for a subunit of Pol III (RPC5), it is tempting to speculate that a MIR-mediated negative autoregulation occurs at this locus, whereby Pol III transcribes the MIR element whose transcription in turn downregulates Pol III abundance through reduced Pol II-dependent expression of its RPC5 subunit.14In an effort to elucidate basic features of MIR transcription mechanism and control, we studied the in vitro transcription properties of four expression-positive MIR loci, and we could establish three distinctive features of Pol III-dependent MIR transcription: (i) the importance of B-box promoter recognition by TFIIIC, but also the possibility of some levels of B box-independent MIR transcription; (ii) the influence of 5'-flanking sequence on MIR transcription; (iii) the strong epigenetic control of MIR expression in vivo, allowing for cell type-specific expression of MIRs containing equally strong basal promoters. Of the four MIRs, whose transcription properties were analyzed in vitro in this study, all showed a marked reduction of transcription ranging from 2.4 to 5.2-fold following mutation of the B-box promoter. Moreover three of them exhibited a 1.8 to 2.5-fold reduction of transcription, while only one was almost unaffected, upon deletion of the 5'-flanking region. The impact of the 5'-flanking region on MIR transcription efficiency is less marked than in the case of Alus17 thus suggesting the possibility that the MIR internal promoter is intrinsically stronger.The appreciable levels of residual transcription upon B box disruption, together with the modest reduction of transcription upon deletion of the 5'-flanking sequence, suggests that the assembly of the Pol III transcription machinery on MIRs might take place through alternative pathways, involving either the 5' flank-A box pair or the A box-B box pair of cis-acting elements. We also cannot exclude that other factors, such as Pol II, TBP, and YY1, which were found to be enriched at expression-positive MIR loci, could take part in Pol III transcription of MIR elements in vivo.The idea of an epigenetic control used by the cell to domesticate transposable elements has been widely accepted and used to explain their overall low expression levels despite their genomic abundance (reviewed in25,26). Recently, SINE silencing has been proposed to more strictly depend on histone methylation rather than DNA methylation.27 This in vivo epigenetic silencing can be deduced from the same in vitro transcription levels of all the four cloned MIRs, whose expression profiles completely differ from each other in cell lines. Epigenetic control could also be responsible for the higher rate of strong terminator signals skipping by Pol III whose ability is only partially maintained in vitro.Until now, MIRs have been studied from a genomic perspective while no efforts have been carried out to obtain insight into their actual in vivo expression and the role of Pol III machinery in their transcription. The present work reveals that these ancient transposable elements that have lost their retrotranspositional activity million years ago, are still widely transcribed in human cells. Their genome-wide expression profiling at single locus resolution represents another step toward the understanding of the mechanisms through which the cells have domesticated them, as well as of the possible roles played by both the act and the products of MIR transcription. The differential expression in different cell types of a large fraction of expression-positive MIR elements is suggestive of a strong epigenetic control which is specific to each cell type and condition, thus opening the possibility to exploit MIR expression profiling to monitor and discover patterns of epigenomic alterations that may accompany pathological states. The ever-increasing availability of RNA-seq datasets for many cell types in different physiological and pathological states represents a valuable source of information for our bioinformatic pipeline to assess, as anticipated for Alu RNAs,28 MIR RNA profiles and their possible roles as a novel type of highly specific molecular signature of diseases.This work used computational and storage services associated with the Hoffman2 Shared Cluster provided by UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education’s Research Technology Group.

(rose of Sharon) is one of the most widespread garden shrubs in the world. We report a draft of the H. syriacus genome comprised of a 1.75 Gb assembly that covers 92% of the genome with only 1.7% (33 Mb) gap sequences. Predicted gene modeling detected 87,603 genes, mostly supported by deep RNA sequencing data. To define gene family distribution among relatives of H. syriacus, orthologous gene sets containing 164,660 genes in 21,472 clusters were identified by OrthoMCL analysis of five plant species, including H. syriacus, Arabidopsis thaliana, Gossypium raimondii, Theobroma cacao and Amborella trichopoda. We inferred their evolutionary relationships based on divergence times among Malvaceae plant genes and found that gene families involved in flowering regulation and disease resistance were more highly divergent and expanded in H. syriacus than in its close relatives, G. raimondii (DD) and T. cacao. Clustered gene families and gene collinearity analysis revealed that two recent rounds of whole-genome duplication were followed by diploidization of the H. syriacus genome after speciation. Copy number variation and phylogenetic divergence indicates that WGDs and subsequent diploidization led to unequal duplication and deletion of flowering-related genes in H. syriacus and may affect its unique floral morphology.1. IntroductionHibiscus syriacus (L.) (rose of Sharon) is a fast-growing deciduous shrub of the Malvaceae family, which includes species such as Gossypium raimondii and Theobroma cacao. Although its’ name indicates this species was first identified in Syria, H. syriacus likely originated from the Korean peninsula and southern China and has since spread to Western countries. In temperate zones, H. syriacus is a commonly grown ornamental species with attractive white, pink, red, lavender, or purple flowers displayed over a long blooming period, though individual flowers last only a day. Its Korean name, Mugunghwa, literally means ‘flowering forever’. In addition to its ornamental value, H. syriacus acts as an ozone bioindicator,1 and its dried flowers and root bark are used in Oriental herbal medicines. Specifically, a novel cyclic peptide (Hibispeptin A) and three naphthalene compounds (syriacusins A-C) isolated from the plant’s root bark have been used as anti-pyretic, anti-helminthic and anti-fungal agents.2,3Polyploidy is a well-established influence on plant genome evolution but is now recognized as a common phenomenon in diverse eukaryotes,4,5 as signs of whole-genome duplication (WGD) have been detected in many sequenced genomes. Recent genome analysis demonstrated that most eudicot plants descended from an ancient hexaploid ancestor and followed lineage-specific polyploidization6 and that two rounds of WGD occurred in ancestral vertebrates.7 In general, changes in ploidy are expected to be deleterious and an ‘evolutionary dead end’ for many species.8 However, polyploidization of plants mediated their survival during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event by increasing their genetic diversity.9 Each round of polyploidization was followed by many gene deletions (homeolog gene loss), interchromosomal rearrangements, neofunctionalization, and subfunctionalization.4,5 In Malvaceae plants, Gossypium includes five tetraploid taxa (AD1 to AD5, 2n= 4x) and 45 diploid taxa (2n= 2x).10 Among them, G. raimondii10 (DD, D-genome), G. arboreum11 (AA, A-genome) and G. hirsutum12 (AtDt) genomes were reported. Hibiscus also includes many polyploid species, such as H. syriacus (2n= 4x= 80), H. aspera (2n= 8x= 72), and H. rosa-sinensis (2n= 16x= 144) and diploid species [H. pedunculatus (2n= 2x= 30) and H. phoeniceus (2n= 2x= 22)].13Here, we report the genome sequence of H. syriacus and the possible correlation between polyploidization and its phenotypes. Comparative genomic analysis of Malvaceae species, including H. syriacus, T. cacao, and G. raimondii (DD), provides clues of the recent polyploidization in H. syriacus by WGDs and unequal regulation of gene dosage by subsequent paleopolyploidy. Our investigation of copy number variations of floral regulators in Malvaceae plants also offers insight into the evolution of flowering phenotypes in H. syriacus. Moreover, the reference genome of H. syriacus is an important resource for identifying relationships between polyploidization and gene diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first report on whole genome sequence analysis of polyploidy woody plants and the effects of WGD on their unique phenotypes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and whole genome sequencingLeaves of H. syriacus plants >100-years-old and nominated as National Monument of Korea trees (serial number 520) were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA for Paired-end (PE) and Mate-pair (MP) libraries was extracted, and libraries for next-generation sequencing were constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of each library was validated using the KAPA SYBR FAST Universal 2× qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA, USA). Each library was sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.2.2. Genome assembly, scaffolding and gap-closingGenome assembly was performed using both Platanus v1.2.114 and SSPACE v2.0.15 To generate longer initial contigs, single reads merged using FLASH v1.2.216 and reads from the PE libraries were assembled using Platanus with parameters to resolve heterozygosity in the H. syriacus genome (-u 0.2 -c 5 -d 0.3 -m 460). The scaffolding process was performed with Platanus and SSPACE. We first determined mapping seed length for scaffolding and then generated longer scaffolds using optimized Platanus parameters (-l 5 -s 41 -u 0.3). To extend scaffold length, SSPACE fulfilled serial scaffolding with hash parameters for the scaffolds generated by Platanus. Lastly, remaining gaps were filled with Platanus and GapCloser version 1.10 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/down/GapCloser_release_2011.tar.gz) using reads from the PE and MP libraries.2.3. Genome annotationAnnotation of the H. syriacus genome was performed using the KOBIC annotation pipeline (modified PGA pipeline17) consisting of repeat masking, mapping of different protein sequence sets, and ab initio prediction performed by AUGUSTUS v3.0.3.18 The protein sequences of A. thaliana (TAIR10, http://www.arabidopsis.org), T. cacao19 and G. raimondii10 were mapped using GeneWise v2.120 to generate protein-based gene models for consensus modeling. AUGUSTUS was used for gene prediction in H. syriacus. Then predicted gene models from AUGUSTUS were validated using BLASTp with protein sequences from the three genomes (T. cacao, G. raimondii and A. thaliana) as queries and erratic gene models were filtered with a BLASTp cut-off value of query coverage = 0.3. The predicted gene models from GeneWise were also filtered using query coverage = 0.3. Remaining gene models of GeneWise depicted as GeneWise format were reformatted as GFF3 data and used to determine the consensus gene model via EVidenceModeler (EVM),21 which combines ab initio gene predictions with protein alignments into weighted consensus gene structures (ab initio predictions = 1, protein alignment = 5, transcript alignment assemblies = 7). Biological functions of the final gene models were assigned using InterPro,22 plant protein sequences in the RefSeq23 and UniProt databases,24 which includes SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL data as described in previous study.17 For functional annotation, three quality criteria were concerned: (i) bit score of the BLAST result is >50 and e-value is <e-10; (ii) subject coverage of the BLAST result is >60%; and (iii) top token score from lexical analysis is >0.5. To infer function for the protein-coding genes, we used InterProScan25 version 5.4 to scan protein sequences against the protein signatures from InterPro.2.4. RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assemblyTotal RNA was extracted from plant leaves, petals, ovaries, and roots using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-Seq libraries were generated using purified total RNA and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Thirty-six gigabases of raw reads were generated and preprocessed using DynamicTrim and LengthSort in SolexaQA.26 The preprocessed raw reads were then used for transcriptome assembly and DEG analysis. Velvet v1.2.07 was used to assess k-mer sizes and assembled contigs, which were then merged using Oases v0.2.08. Assembled transcripts were validated using BLASTx (e-value < e-10, best hit) against 1,917,424 protein sequences from 39 plant genomes selected from each family including Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum phureja, T.cacao, G.raimondii, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Cucumis sativus, Vitis vinifera.2.5. Evaluation of genome assemblyFor validation of the assembled genome sequence, CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Apporoach) v2.527 and BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) v1.2228 were used in H. syriacus genome using default parameters. The CEGMA mapped a gene structures to new genomic sequence using a set of highly conserved protein family in eukaryotes by Hidden Markov Model. We evaluated 248 core eukaryotic genes defied by CEGMA to our genome sequence. The BUSCO provides completeness assessment of assembled genome based on orthologous group with single copy from OrthoDB (http://www.orthodb.org) using hidden Markov model for profile of amino acid alignments. For BUSCO assessments, we used 429 gene sets of conserved orthologs in eukaryotes.2.6. Detection of gene families in the H. syriacus genomeOrthoMCL v2.0.229 was used to identify gene family clusters in H. syriacus and the other four sequenced genomes which are G. raimondii, T. cacao, A. trichopodaand A. thaliana (In the first step, a set of high quality of gene models was obtained by rejecting low-quality sequences based on default parameters in OrthoMCL. The default parameters of rejecting low quality protein sequences were (i) shorter than 10 amino acids (ii) >20% stop-codons (iii) >20% non-standard amino acids. Pairwise sequence similarities between all input protein sequences were calculated by all-by-all BLASTp with an e-value cut-off of 1e-05 and a minimum match length of 50%. To define ortholog cluster structure, a Markov clustering algorithm was applied with an inflation value (-I) of 1.5 (default value in OrthoMCL). Putative splice variants were removed from the data set; longest protein sequences were kept and subsequently filtered for premature stop codons and incompatible sequences.2.7. Detection of collinearity blocks in Malvaceae plantsMCScanX30 was used to construct synteny and collinearity blocks between H. syriacus and G. raimondii against T. cacao.19 First, homologous gene pairs were identified using protein sequences from the three genomes and then scanned inter- and intra-species by BLASTp (options with -e 1e-10 –b 5 –v 5). The BLASTp output was used with merged GFFs of three species to perform MCscanX with default parameters. We generated gene synteny and collinearity data to align proteins of the two species against reference chromosome of T. cacao. Collinearity blocks containing fewer than five proteins were excluded. To search a candidate of duplicated regions, we made the groups of collinear block from multiple collinear blocks which have similar protein members (>80%), and the same chromosome in T. cacao. Then, each block in H. syriacus and G. raimondii was counted by overlap against the cluster blocks of T. cacao. The duplicated regions in H. syriacus and G. raimondii were identified, if the number of blocks was more than two.2.8. Estimation of speciation time in Malvaceae plantsTo construct a phylogenetic tree of the five species (A. trichopoda, A. thaliana, G. raimondii, T. cacao and H. syriacus), we extracted 941 single-copy gene sets from all genomes in the OrthoMCL clusters. We performed multiple alignments of the CDSs of each gene set using Prank (-f = nexus -codon).31 The alignment file was used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on calculations of divergence time for the five species.32 For accurate tree construction, we assigned taxon sets based on previously calculated speciation of A. thaliana, G. raimondii and T. cacao. The Bayesian software package BEAST32 (v1.8.2) was used to estimate divergence times and construct the final tree. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses in BEAST was conducted for 10 million generations with samples every 1,000 steps and the effective sampling size was over 150 for all of parameters. We used SRD0633 as a substitution model and the Yule process34 as a traditional speciation model.2.9. Identification of TF candidatesWe identified TF candidates as previously described.17 Briefly, predicted proteins containing TF domains were screened by InterProScan22 search against Pfam35 databases. The TF candidates were classified based on rules as indicated at PlnTFDB (http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/rules.php, Rules for the classification of TFs).36 In the case of TF gene families that don’t have Pfam ID, domain alignments as Clustal format were downloaded from PlnTFDB and Hidden Markov Model profiles were built and screened using HMMER.37 The assigned TF candidates were confirmed by BLASTp against plant TF protein sequences downloaded from PlnTFDB (http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/downloads.php).2.10. Identification of genes encoding nucleotide-binding site proteinsTo identify nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-encoding genes, representative genes from each plant genome were screened using the raw Hidden Markov Model (HMMER3.0)38 to search for the Pfam NBS family PF00931 domain (e-value cut-off of 1.0). All putative NBS protein sequences were analysed and manually curated by a BLASTp search against known R gene sequences in GenBank. To further identify TIR homologs and sequences encoding CC and LRR motifs, candidate NBS-LRR protein sequences were characterized using SMART,39 the Pfam database40 and the COILS programme41 with a threshold of 0.9 to detect CC domain specifically.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyH. syriacus plants over 100-years-old were selected for genome sequencing. Illumina whole-genome shotgun sequencing generated 233.3 Gb (122.8× coverage) of genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S1). PE libraries (250–500 bp) were generated, and 2 kb and 5 kb MP libraries were sequenced with a read length of 101 or 151 bp. Pre-processing analysis of raw sequences was performed to remove extraneous sequences for accurate genome assembly as described in the previous report.17 After filtering, 156.6 Gb (82.4× coverage) of H. syriacus genome sequences were used for further analysis (Supplementary Table S2). K-mer distribution analysis, which provides information related to low frequencies, sequencing depth, level of heterozygosity, and genome size42 was then applied using Jellyfish (Supplementary Fig. S1). The estimated genome size of 1,901 Mb was calculated by dividing the total volume by the peak of distribution as described previously.17Validation of the assembled genome was performed using 128,888 representative transcripts derived from de novo assembly of a combined transcriptome from all libraries (Supplementary Table S3). To confirm sequence alignment between transcriptome assembly and scaffolds, we performed BLAST comparisons for the transcriptome assembly and scaffolds as queries and subjects, respectively. We found that 117,431 (91.1%) assembled transcripts as query sequences matched to scaffolds based with 98% identity. In addition, 93,688 (79.8%) transcripts matched to genome sequence with query coverage over 80%, and 82,394 (70.2%) transcripts matched over 90% coverage by the assembled scaffolds (Supplementary Fig. 2). The quality of the assembly was also evaluating using CEGMA27 (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) and BUSCO28 (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs). These analyses showed 92.74% of completeness (230 of 248 CEGs) from CEGMA and 92% of complete BUSCOs. These results suggested that H. syriacus genome assembly was high quality. As a result, 1,748 Mb (91.9% of 1,901 Mb) of genomic sequences were assembled into 77,492 scaffolds. The assembled genome was comprised of 33 Mb (1.9%) gap sequences and 1,715 Mb of contigs with N50 = 30 kb (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Summary of H. syriacus genome assemblySummary of H. syriacus genome assembly3.2. Genome annotationAnnotation of the H. syriacus genome was performed using the KOBIC Genome Annotation pipeline (Supplementary Fig. S3), including masking repetitive sequences, transcriptome mapping, reference protein mapping using GeneWise, ab initio gene prediction, and determination of consensus gene models using EVM.Before masking repetitive sequences, repeat annotation was performed by RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) for the assembled genome. Due to a lack of repeat sequence information for this genome, we constructed a de novo repeat library using RepeatModeler, and RepeatMasker was applied for annotation of the constructed repeat library. Repeat sequences, except for unknown transposable elements (TEs), were masked so we could identify essential gene families, such as those that encode receptor-like kinases and nucleotide-binding proteins. TEs comprised 1,095.8 Mb (57.6%) of the genome (Supplementary Table S5) and mostly included long terminal repeats (LTRs), which accounted for approximately 30% of total TEs. Gypsy and Copia retrotransposons were the most common LTRs detected.Transcripts mapping was performed using TopHat and Cufflinks, and protein alignment was performed by GeneWise. The protein sequences of A.thaliana (TAIR10), T. cacao and G. raimondii were mapped to generate protein-based gene models. For annotation of duplicated genes or gene families, mapping regions of a reference protein in the H. syriacus genome were determined from tBLASTn (default e-value 10) results using custom Perl scripts. These steps prevented mis-annotation of duplicated genes due to lack of mapping data for reference proteins from parsing single best-matched regions in the H. syriacus genome. We annotated 87,603 genes using KOBIC annotation prediction with an average CDS length of 1,188 bp, similar to that for G. raimondii (Table 2). Consensus gene models were evaluated using 88.4 Gb of Illumina-derived RNA-Seq data. Overall, 91.76% of the predicted coding sequences were supported by Illumina data, demonstrating the high accuracy of KOBIC annotation prediction. The H. syriacus genome contains two times more genes than G. raimondii and three times more genes than T. cacao (Table 2), suggesting a polyploid genome as first indicated in a previous report.13Statistics of H. syriacus gene modelsaCacao genome paper19bCotton genome paper10cTAIR10 annotation (http://www.arabidopsis.org)Statistics of H. syriacus gene modelsaCacao genome paper19bCotton genome paper10cTAIR10 annotation (http://www.arabidopsis.org)We also performed OrthoMCL analysis to detect orthologous genes among Malvaceae plants, A. thaliana, and Amborella trichopoda. We identified 21,472 orthologous gene sets containing 164,660 genes, 5,300 of which were H. syriacus-specific (Fig. 1). Interestingly, these genes were the number of gene was three times larger than those of G. raimondii and T. cacao, further indicating H. syriacus’ polyploidy. In addition, relatively large numbers of singletons in the genomes of A. thaliana and A. trichopoda suggest that the Malvaceae lineage diverged long ago and now shows a high degree of evolutionary distance from other eudicots. For further analysis, estimation of speciation time and comparison of genome structures among Malvaceae plants were performed using paired gene sets.

Genome structure and polyploidization of H. syriacusTo compare genome structures among Malvaceae plants, collinearity blocks were detected using MCScanX.30 Two WGDs or a triplication event have occurred in G. raimondii (DD),43,44 while none have occurred in T. cacao. Therefore, the T. cacao genome was used as a template to detect collinearity blocks in G. raimondii and H. syriacus (Fig. 2A). We detected T. cacao collinearity blocks in G. raimondii and H. syriacus with frequencies ranging from 2 to 7. The H. syriacus genome contains four times as many collinearity blocks than G. raimondii and blocks two times larger, indicating WGD events in H. syriacus. Duplication patterns were identified using phylogenetic analyses, which revealed single-copy flowering regulator genes in the diploid genomes of A. thaliana, A. trichopoda and T. cacao (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Duplication of the GIGANTEA (GI) gene indicated WGDs occurred three times in H. syriacus but that many descendant genes since the first WGD have been lost (Fig. 2B), such as the CONSTANS and SOC1 genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, diploidization and homeolog loss in H. syriacus, first proposed in previous studies,5 included duplication of distinct, individual gene families stemming from random homeolog gene loss after each WGD. Paleohexaploidy has occurred in the G. raimondii genome,10,43,44 and duplication patterns we observed were consistent with these previous results.

Red (H. syriacus) and green (G. raimondii) stars indicate WGD and blue circles indicate diploidization events.To estimate divergence time among Malvaceae plants, we calculated synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and constructed phylogenetic trees via the BEAST package using single-copy genes in OrthoMCL clusters. The trees revealed that the Malvaceae family diverged from a Brassicae-Malvaceae common ancestor approximately 91.91 MYA (Fig. 2C) and that H. syriacus, G. raimondii and T. cacao belong to a common subclade that diverged from a common ancestor approximately 30.88 MYA, which corroborates earlier studies.10 Occurrence of duplications in G. raimondii genes ranged from 24.46 to 45.46 MYA (Fig. 2B), while H. syriacus individual gene duplications before speciation and WGD events ranged from 25.23 to 48.23 MYA and from 4.61 to 21.15 MYA, respectively (Fig. 2B and C). These results suggest that one WGD occurred in H. syriacus before speciation and two WGDs occurred after speciation.Previous reports indicate transcriptional factors (TFs) were retained as duplicated genes, while other genes remained singletons.5 We investigated the duplication status of TFs in H. syriacus, and other Malvaceae plants and identified 9,642 TFs and transcriptional regulators in 81 families in the H. syriacus genome. Eighteen H. syriacus TF gene families, including AP2-ERF, AUX/IAA, and FAR1, contained more genes than those in diploid genomes (Supplementary Table S6). In particular, the H. syriacus genome contains 10 times more FAR1 family genes than the other genomes we analysed, although 19 TF genes showed convergent evolution patterns, and the proportions of other major TF family genes were similar across species. Thus, complex WGD events followed by diploidization led to unequal regulation of gene dosage and caused gene family copy number variations in H. syriacus.3.4. Flowering-time and disease-resistance genes in H. syriacusGenetic and molecular mechanisms of floral development in different plant species is highly conserved45 and include four major flowering pathways (photoperiod, autonomous, vernalization and gibberellin) well-characterized in A. thaliana. Main flowering signals are regulated by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the photoperiod pathway, while the vernalization pathway acts via removal of an FT repressor after exposure to certain stimuli. H. syriacus is a long-day flowering plant with a long blooming period and can express a multivoltinism phenotype with 20–30 blossoms per day. However, the flowers of H. syriacus open daily and last for only one day. To uncover the genetic mechanisms controlling these phenotypes, we investigated genes involved in the four major flowering pathways of A. trichopoda, A. thaliana, T. cacao, G. raimondii and H. syriacus and their expression pattern in H. syriacus tissues (flowers, ovaries, roots and leaves) (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic analysis of flowering-time genes identified H. syriacus-specific clusters (Fig. 3B). Because flowering time is frequently dependent on gene copy number,46 we used reference genes from Arabidopsis species to determine copy number variation of these genes among diverse plant genomes (Table 3) and found that copy numbers of H. syriacus were two to seven times greater than those in the other four genomes analysed. Among the flowering-time regulatory genes examined in our study, numbers of genes involved in circadian rhythm regulation (CO, ELF4, FKF1, GI, LHY, PHYs) and flower initiation (FCA, FLK, FT, LFY, VIN3, SOC1, TFL, SVP) were significantly higher in H. syriacus than in the other genomes. Moreover, the copy number of FAR1 family genes that modulate phytochrome A signaling showed high copy numbers in H. syriacus compared to other genomes (Supplementary Table S6). Plants with spike inflorescence, such as barley, rice, and wheat, also contain high copy numbers of FAR1 genes; thus, high copy numbers of FAR1 may also affect the flowering phenotype of H. syriacus.

(B) Expression patterns of photoperiod/circadian clock genes in petals, ovaries, roots, and leaves.Comparison of flowering-time gene copy numbersComparison of flowering-time gene copy numbersMost disease-resistance (R) family genes encode intracellular proteins with a NBS and leucine-rich repeats (LRR).47–51 The NBS-encoding R gene family is one of the largest in the H. syriacus genome, with 472 genes, approximately three times greater than A. trichopoda and A. thaliana. These genes are divided into two clades based on presence of the distinct toll interleukin receptor (TIR) domain.50 TIR genes in H. syriacus (n= 76, 17%) are markedly over-represented compared to those of S.lycopersicum (25 genes, 9%), G. raimondii (27 genes, 9%) and T. cacao (17 genes, 6%) (Table 4 and Fig. 4). More than 70% of NBS-encoding genes in Malvaceae plants (H. syriacus, T. cacao, and G. raimondii) are shared among 26 subclasses, indicating that most R genes are derived from a common ancestor (Supplementary Table S7). In addition, 125 NBS-encoding genes in H. syriacus from four subclasses are expanded approximately five time more than other Malvaceae and 18 NBS-encoding genes from seven subclasses are unique to H. syriacus (Supplementary Table S8). Notably, genes in TIR and RPW8 motif-encoding subclasses (NBS cluster 11 and NBS cluster 20, respectively) exhibited extensive expansion in the H. syriacus genome, underwent unequal duplication events, and displayed great diversity among plant genomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S8). The different R gene repertoires in the H. syriacus genome suggest that expansion and diversity of clustered R genes might involve lineage-specific gene duplication events, eventually leading to divergent evolution in close relatives. These results provide useful preliminary information to support further comparative analysis of flowering-time and disease-resistance genes in other perennial plant species.

Comparative NBS-LRR gene family numbersComparative NBS-LRR gene family numbers4. DiscussionPolyploidy is an important mechanism of plant speciation that occurs in many angiosperms5 and leads to increased genetic diversity compared to their diploid progenitors. Initial polyploidy events were followed by successive paleopolyploidy or diploidization events to stabilize the newly expanded genomes. Paleopolyploidy or diploidization returns a polyploidy genome to a diploid-like state and is characterized by loss of duplicated genes, chromosomes, and repetitive DNA, gene silencing, and altered chromosome pairings.4,5 The newly formed polyploids may experience rapid homeolog gene loss, genome reconstruction post-polyploidization, and altered patterns of gene expression.5 Retained diploid genes are less often duplicated due to cumulative losses of the homeologous copy in a duplicated gene pair. Consequently, some genes are consistently returned to singleton status, while others, such as those encoding TFs, are retained in duplicate.5,52 Duplicated TF genes were commonly found in the H. syriacus genome, although 25% of these genes showed evidence of convergent evolution, and their copy numbers varied greatly. Our phylogenetic analysis of individual genes in H. syriacus also indicated that homeolog gene loss events and diploidization occurred after WGD. Recent studies have suggested that one duplicate gene may be more susceptible to loss than others,4 which could account for unequal gene dosage and corresponding phenotypic changes in H. syriacus.The flowering phenotype of H. syriacus is characterized by multivoltinism, a long blooming period, and high blossom turnover. We found that the copy numbers of most flowering-related genes, such as GIGANTEA, CONSTANS, and ELF4 (but not FT), were higher in H. syriacus than in the diploid genomes of T. cacao, A. trichopoda, and A. thaliana. In addition, FAR1 genes, which modulate phytochrome A signaling by directly activating transcription of FHY1 and FHL and lead to accumulation of nuclear phytochrome A, were significantly increased in H. syriacus. FAR1 regulates the circadian clock, and its high copy number could directly affect the flowering phenotype of H. syriacus as seen in plants with spike inflorescence.The investigation of duplication event timing in H. syriacus genome showed that two recent WGDs occurred after speciation. In the past 50 million years, the average global temperature has been <20°C,53 which is far below the optimal flowering temperature for H. syriacus. Lower temperatures, especially between 5 and 20 MYA, could have been an environmental suppressor of H. syriacus pollination that prompted polyploidization to overcome these unfavourable conditions and unreduced gamete formation.5 Furthermore, low temperatures could have exerted selective pressure on H. syriacus to extend its blooming period for increased chance of pollination.Perennial plants are prone to invasion by pathogens before reproduction, and many fungal and bacterial diseases often threaten the life cycle of H. syriacus. Aside from primary defenses, such as thickened cell walls and secondary metabolites, plants have numerous disease resistance (R) genes that confer protection against various pathogens. In H. syriacus, NBS-containing R genes account for ~0.53% of its total predicted genes, which is lower than other plant genomes studies, whose R gene proportions ranged from 0.63 to 1.35%. However, subsets of these genes, including those with TIR- and RPW8-encoding motifs, are markedly over-represented in the H. syriacus genome compared to those of other plants. Genes in the RPW8-NBS-LRR subclass provide broad-spectrum resistance against powdery mildew pathogens in Arabidopsis,54 and genes in TIR-NBS subclasses are conserved in basal angiosperms and eudicots, such as A. trichopoda (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5), but are absent in most monocots.55,56 Their greater dominance in the H. syriacus genome indicates divergent evolution of TIR- and RPW-containing NBS genes from an ancestral origin may have led to more extensive expansion of this gene family. Moreover, the long life cycle of woody plants makes it difficult for them to adapt to pathogens undergoing more rapid evolution, thus favouring R gene maintenance and expansion for the plants’ survival.Polyploidization in plants is a common mechanism for their adaptation to environmental change. After divergence from the H. syriacus-G. raimondii common ancestor, two WGDs and subsequent diploidization occurred in the H. syriacus genome to promote the plants’ survival in unfavourable environments. During the diploidization events, low temperatures may have selected for the maintenance of duplicate flowering-related genes whose high copy numbers led to the multivoltinism and long blooming period phenotypes expressed by H. syriacus. Further analyses H. syriacus, T. cacao and G. raimondii (DD) genomes with another diploid genome, G. arboretum (AA)11 and allotetraploid genome, G. hirsutum (AtDt)12 will provide more information of evolution of Malvaceae plants.AvailabilityThis Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession MBGJ00000000.

Here, we present SUPER-CAP, a bioinformatics web tool aimed at handling Sequence Capture data, fine calculating the allele frequency of variations and building genotype-specific sequence of captured genes. The dataset used to develop this in silico strategy consists of 378 loci and related regulative regions in a collection of 44 tomato landraces. About 14,000 high-quality variants were identified. The high depth (>40×) of coverage and adopting the correct filtering criteria allowed identification of about 4,000 rare variants and 10 genes with a different copy number variation. We also show that the tool is capable to reconstruct genotype-specific sequences for each genotype by using the detected variants. This allows evaluating the combined effect of multiple variants in the same protein. The architecture and functionality of SUPER-CAP makes the software appropriate for a broad set of analyses including SNP discovery and mining. Its functionality, together with the capability to process large data sets and efficient detection of sequence variation, makes SUPER-CAP a valuable bioinformatics tool for genomics and breeding purposes.1. IntroductionIdentifying sequence polymorphisms responsible for phenotypic variation and understanding the genetic basis of complex traits have been two major challenges of plant molecular genetics since the development of the first molecular markers up to the impressive high-throughput genomics technologies available today.1,2 The process of genotype-phenotype association is one of the central goals in the path towards plant improvement, and this requires the use of all the genetic and genomic information available for a given individual and/or population. The association of the genomic variation with traits of interest requires the reliable detection and the systematic investigation of the entire spectrum of DNA variability, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (INDELs) as well as copy number variations (CNVs) and presence/absence of variations (PAV). Substantial progress towards this goal was made in the last few years. Large germoplasm collections have been characterized using SSR,3,4 SNP markers and SNP arrays.5–9 However, most of these approaches had known disadvantages that limited the power of the detection, in particular because the SNPs used in these studies were selected from a limited number of divergent sources and were commonly chosen to exceed a minimum frequency of the rare allele. Whole genome sequencing has also been used to explore individual variation at the genomic level in plants10–13 but, due to its high cost and complexity in data analysis, it is not expected to be widely applied for investigation of variants underlying specific traits of interest at a sufficient coverage. Recently, the development of microarray based or liquid-based genomic selection methods, commonly referred to as ‘Sequence Capture’, provided an affordable way to produce high-quality variants, thus solving most of the ascertained bias reported.14–16 Combining the recently developed targeted sequence enrichment with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, Sequence Capture methodology represents a powerful strategy for enhancing data generation to assess genetic variation of target regions, and it is likely to replace PCR as the main target enrichment method in both plants and animals.17 In addition, setting the experiments to obtain a sufficient depth of coverage would support the detection of rare functional variants and allow the discovery of complete haplotypes of genes, as well as CNV and PAV. With the ever-decreasing costs of sequencing and the advances in Sequence Capture technologies, these approaches are nowadays largely applied in different fields. Thanks to its high reliability and moderate cost per experiment, Sequence Capture is becoming an affordable diagnostic tool for medical and personalized medicine purposes.18 Despite its large employment in the medical field, the use of Sequence Capture in plant science is still emerging. Sequence Capture experiments were carried out for few species, including maize,19 strawberry,20 rapeseed canola,21,22 black cottonwood,23 potato,24 wheat,25,26 medicago17 and cassava.27The work herein proposed, which investigates the sequence variation of a group of 378 genes and the related regulative regions in a collection of 44 landraces, represents the first study of Sequence Capture in tomato species. Although software tools are available for variant calling and variant mining, their application is not straightforward, requiring users to install various packages and to convert data into different formats. This lack of easily accessible software pushed us to propose a web-based tool, named SUPER-CAP (http://supercap.sequentiabiotech.com/), to boost quick, proficient and affordable analysis of sequence capture data. This tool, benefitting from SUPER-W pipeline28 and combining different software and customizable procedures, assists the user in sequence capture experiments from the identification of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) to the reconstruction of genotype-specific (hereafter referred to as ‘private’) sequences/gene features for each target region of each sample.In addition, in this study, an explorative investigation on different aspects affecting sequence capture data was also carried out. For instance, since one of the major challenges in the enrichment/capture technologies are to avoid spurious variants calling for heterozygous (He) loci, this work evaluated how the depth of the reads and the procedure set-ups impact the variant calling of He variants. In fact, being the tomato a highly homozygous (Ho) species, it represents a good model for testing He variant calling into the gene set considered. In addition, spurious callings are frequently referred to multi-copy gene families (duplicated region/high homologous regions).29 The gene set considered in this study represents a large range of variability in terms of gene families. This allowed for suitable assessment and estimation of the effective presence of He variants among the multi-copy genes.As a final point, the variant set was also used to investigate: (i) the level and the type of sequence polymorphism in captured genes across the 44 tomato samples, (ii) the pattern of variants distribution among the lines, with respect to the identification of rare variants, (iii) the number of genes CNV, PAV and (iv) the functional annotation of the variants in order to prioritize the study of highly relevant variants. The work herein proposed represents a framework for easy Sequence Capture-related experiments that will promote similar studies, as well as in differing species. 2. Material and methods2.1. Plant material and selection of target genesA panel of 44 genetically diverse Solanumlycopersicum genotypes was selected from a wide collection of tomato landraces30 available at the University of Naples, department of Agricultural Sciences. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under controlled conditions at the aforementioned Department; detailed information, including source and geographic origin for each genotype, is presented in Supplementary Table S1.Genomic DNA from the 44 genotypes was isolated from young tomato leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNA quantity and purity/degradation was firstly checked on 1% agarose gel. In order to fit the standard parameters for Sequence Capture analyses, DNA concentration and quality were determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s requirements.An inventory of 378 candidate genes representing possible targets for antioxidant metabolism in tomatoes was compiled from published literature, previous research31,32 and exploration of metabolic pathway databases (LycoCyc at http://solgenomics.net/and KEGG at http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Genes were also selected to represent different gene family sizes. In total 235 out of the 378 genes completely represent 25 gene families. In particular, 171 genes belong to eight large gene families (we declared a big family if composed by more than 10 copies in the genome), 40 belong to seven medium gene families (between nine and four gene copies), and 24 belong to 10 small gene families (two or three copies). Six out of the 378 genes represent single copy genes. Moreover, in order to take into account variations in the regulatory region of each selected gene, a 3 Kbp promoter region was also included in the analysis. For genes with an intergenic distance shorter than 3 Kbp, only the related shorter portion of the promoter was considered. Supplementary Table S2 shows detailed information of the genomic regions considered.2.2. Sequence capture design and sequencingProbe design and gene enrichment were performed following the protocol provided with the solution-based Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Library (Roche-NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA). Loci coordinates of the genic and promotor regions were identified and submitted to Roche Diagnostics for probe design using NimbleDesign and SignalMap software (http://www.nimblegen.com/products/software/index.html). This probe set contains probes with up to 20 close matches in the genome as determined by the Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/ssaha/). Acco rding to NimbleGen specification, we considered a probe to match the genome if the variation ratio was <0.05. Following the SeqCapEZ protocol, 44 paired-end libraries were prepared using the Illumina Kapa Library Prep Kit and were multiplexed and sequenced with HiSeq 1,500 (read size:100 bp) according to Illumina specifications.2.3. SUPER-CAP usage and proceduresSUPER-CAP is a bioinformatics tool specifically designed for accurate mapping, variant calling and reconstruction of private sequences using the variations detected from Sequence Capture data. SUPER-CAP includes an updated version of SUPER-W (release 4).28 SUPER-CAP is a user-friendly web tool which only needs two input files to work: the captured region file in BED format and the filtered NGS reads in FASTQ format. The main steps and procedure underlying the SUPER-CAP tool, including the calling variants, the variants filtering and the targeted sequence reconstruction are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideThe SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideThe SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.The SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.The SUPER-CAP tool. The main steps and procedures underlying the tool are graphically reported in the workflow.SUPER-W has been modified to specifically handle sequence capture data. In this new version, SUPER-W uses as input the BED file of capture probe design (it can also handle a whole exome) and the filtered NGS reads. The first step is to map all the samples against a reference genome (specified by the user) with BWA (version 0.7.5; options used: mem:BWA-MEM algorithm).33 The mapped files are processed for PCR duplicates (Picard, MarkDuplicates tool, version 1.118), filtered for quality (minimum quality required: 30), sorted and indexed.34 The resulting BAM file is then used for the variant calling step. Small variations (SNPs and short deletion and insertion polymorphisms), large variations (deletions, inversions and duplications), or both, can be set for detection. The small variations are called with SAMtools34 through an accurate and sensitive double calling step, while the structural variants are detected using LUMPY (version 0.0.11; options used: -mv 4 –tt 0 –pe –sr).35Once the variant calling step has been successfully completed, statistics on sequence capture experiment are calculated. The statistics report can be considered as a checkpoint, allowing the user to check the IN/OFF target read count, which highlights the specificity or sensitivity of the sequence capture experiment.Raw genomic variants annotated by SUPER-W are then classified and filtered out. As default, only variants with a coverage >6× and a Phred quality >30 were used for subsequent analysis. Furthermore, variants overlapping each other are removed from downstream analysis as they cause a low confidence region. Moreover, a special option has been released to allow calling variants according to customized allele frequency (AF). As default value, variants with an AF between 0 and 0.2 are considered Ho for the reference allele, variants with a AF between 0.4 and 0.6 are considered He while variants with an AF between 0.8 and 1 are considered Ho for the alternative allele. Variants with an AF ranging out of boundaries set (i.e. between 0.2 and 0.4 and between 0.6 and 0.8) are called with an alert comment in the output VCF file. Coverage and quality filters as well as the AF parameters can be manually modified by the user. Finally, the filtered variants were classified according to type (SNP or INDEL). For SNP variants the breakdown into transitions and transversions was also determined. To improve the variant features, SnpSift and SnpEff36 were implemented in the workflow, which allows imputing the gene region in which the variants fall (promoter, intron, exon, Untranslated regions (UTRs)) and the putative impact of the variants on protein functionality.The high-quality variants, the reference genome and the BED file of the captured regions were used to perform a targeted sequence reconstruction. Using bcftools37 and BEDtools38 utilities, a new consensus sequence was created by applying the filtered variants to the reference sequence. He SNPs were introduced using IUPAC ambiguity codes and He INDELs were discarded. Through a liftover process, which recalculates the gene coordinates after the insertion or deletion of INDELs, a FASTA file with reconstructed sequences was created. Variants reconstructed were also displayed in the SUPER-CAP’s browser results page, allowing the user to explore the type and the number of variants easily.2.4. Web tool development and designWith the aim of supplying SUPER-CAP with a graphical user interface, we developed a NodeJS-based web tool (version 4.4.1. Available at https://nodejs.org/), available at ‘http://supercap.sequentiabiotech.com/’. Using this tool, the user can upload the two required files (the BED file of the target regions and the FASTQ files of the sequenced reads) and choose the analysis parameters (i.e. the quality thresholds for the filtering procedure and the AF range for the He /Ho assignation). An ID is given after completion of the procedure, which is required for accessing the results page. Both the reconstructed sequences in FASTA format and the whole variants in VCF format can be downloaded from the ‘Download section’. In addition, the visualization of the reconstructed sequence is also shown in an interactive graphical interface in the results page. Here the user can explore, for each gene in each genotype, the type and the number of variants that have been incorporated and the effect they produced on the reference protein. General mapping statistics, including IN/OFF targets, as well as the sensitivity of the experiment, are displayed in the same page.2.5. Use of SUPER-CAP on tomato experimental dataThe reads obtained by sequencing the tomato DNA samples were quality checked using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Then, reads were filtered for quality and trimmed with the Trimmomatic tool (version 0.30; options used: –windowsSize 3 –requiredQuality 22 –MINLEN 30).39 By using the filtered reads, the following procedures were undertaken: reads falling in the designed regions with a PHRED quality >30 and a minimum length of 30 bp were mapped onto the tomato genome SL2.50.40 Then, PCR duplicates and multiple mapped reads were removed by filtering on a meaningful MAPQ score of 30. Once the variants were called, in order to reduce the number of false positives calls, an additional filter was applied and only variants with coverage higher than 6× and a PHRED quality >30 were selected. The total numbers of He and Ho variants, as well as their ratio, were calculated with default parameters (0.4–0.6 as optimal AF range for the He calling). A Neighbour-joining dendrogram was built in TASSEL v.541 by using the detected filtered variants, and the related tree was graphically refined using the Fig-tree software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). SNPs and INDELs were also structurally and functionally annotated with SnpEff v4.236 using the tomato iTAG2.40 annotation.2.6. Validation of variantsTo test the reliability of the adopted procedures, a validation of the variants detected was achieved by exploring publicly available data for tomato. In particular, data from a previous genotyping experiment which detected variants for 7,720 SNPs through the SolCAP array,30,32 as well as data concerning the resequencing of 360 tomato genomes,42 were considered. Of the 44 genotypes used in this study, 37 were common to those used in the SolCAP experiment and 9 in the 360 genome project. The validation was performed by comparing the number and the concordance of shared variations among the common genotypes. Only Ho variations were used for the validation. Intersection of the sets was carried out by intersectBed tool38 and the comparison analysis by using VCFtools.432.7. CNV and PAV identificationThe coverage and total number of reads were evaluated for each sample. Alignments were visualized using the IGV browser version 2.3.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). CNV was computed following a modified procedure of Schiessl et al. (2014)22 using a normalized read coverage for each captured region. CNV in a given target region was assumed if the ratio of normalized coverage (genotype)/normalized coverage (all genotypes) was <0.5 or >1.5, respectively. PAV was assumed if the ratio was <0.05.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequence capture experimentWe designed a custom capture probe experiment by using a customizable and cost-effective approach based on Roche-NimbleGen SeqCap EZ technology. This framework helped to set up an in silico approach (SUPER-CAP) with the aim of facilitating further sequence capture studies.This study investigated the sequence variation of a group of 378 genes and related regulative regions. The total size of the sequenced region was 2,338,578 bp, of which 1,353,817 bp corresponded to genic regions and 984,761 bp to their related promoter regions. Capturing probes were developed by Roche NimbleGen to target the specific regions. The final design was non-redundant and covered about 92.6% of the targeted regions. The 7.4% of non-covered regions represents those that did not match the minimum parameters for the capture and in the majority of the cases (>95%) these were promoter regions. It has already been reported that the cover design slightly varies depending on different factors, including the commercial technology adopted.44After the enrichment of the targeted regions, each capture library was sequenced in one Illumina HiSeq lane. The number of raw reads generated per sample varied between 1,103,352 and 2,683,868 (Table 1). Sequenced reads were analyzed in order to remove low-quality regions. After quality trimming, between 71 and 93% of the reads were retained and then used as input for SUPER-CAP. Data were then statistically evaluated for: (i) alignment rates, the number of mapped reads on the total reads, (ii) specificity, the number of reads that map to the targeted sequence and (iii) sensitivity, the percentage of targeted bases covered by sequence reads. The reads from samples 21A, 1A and 64A showed the highest alignment rates (>98%). In contrast, the lowest alignment rate was observed in genotypes 85A, 79A and 38A (<78%). The alignment success was however independent of the total number of reads. Specificity of the capture was imputed considering the number of reads in the target interval on the number of mapped reads. It showed an average value of 74.80%. The minimum value 67.2% was detected for the genotype 14A and the maximum (77.02%) for the genotype 43A. In addition, considering an extension of flanking regions of 200 bp, the specificity was found to vary only slightly, showing an average increase of <1%. The range, considering flanking regions, was indeed from 67.75 to 77.59%. Alignment statistics for the 44 individual captures (Sample ID)The number of raw reads (Raw reads), mapped reads (Mapped reads), mapped reads with quality Q > 30 (Mapped reads Q>30) and without duplications (Mapped reads Q > 30 WD) were reported. For each sample, the alignment rate (Alignment rate), the specificity (On target reads), the specificity including the flanking regions of 200 bp (On target reads + 200 bp) and the average depth of coverage (Mean depth of coverage ) are also reported.Alignment statistics for the 44 individual captures (Sample ID)The number of raw reads (Raw reads), mapped reads (Mapped reads), mapped reads with quality Q > 30 (Mapped reads Q>30) and without duplications (Mapped reads Q > 30 WD) were reported. For each sample, the alignment rate (Alignment rate), the specificity (On target reads), the specificity including the flanking regions of 200 bp (On target reads + 200 bp) and the average depth of coverage (Mean depth of coverage ) are also reported.Even though investigators are seeking experimental designs that generate robust scientific findings at the lowest sequencing cost, an adequate depth of coverage is very important in order to reduce the variant-error rate and the assembly gaps, and to obtain the correct call of variants, in particular for the He ones.45 It has indeed been demonstrated that for short Illumina reads a coverage comprised between 30× and 55× appears necessary to correctly identify SNVs and small INDELs with a proper degree of reliability.45,46In our experiment, the normalized mean coverage of the total targeted regions showed an average value of 53.89×, allowing very accurate detection of variants. Analysing the sensitivity of the experiment (Supplementary Fig. S1), which shows how well the targeted region is covered for reads at depths from 1× to the max depth (>150×), we observed that at a minimum coverage of 1× about 95% of the designed target regions resulted completely covered. Between 91 and 94% of the target was covered when a minimum coverage of ten reads was applied. At 20×, 76–93% of the target regions was still covered.Although Sequence Capture experiments represent a promising technology, only few studies have used Sequence Capture in plants (<20 in PubMed in April 2016). Probably the lacking of straightforward procedures for data analysis makes this technology still emerging. For this reason, SUPER-CAP, representing a user-friendly tool, could boost the use of this technology also for plant organisms. Moreover, in this study, the high rates reached for the capture parameters, in particular for the specificity (>74%), highlighted the high efficiency reached by combing an accurate probe design with a high performant aligner included in the pipeline (BWA), for which high confidence of sequence alignments has been already reported.19 This makes the performances obtained in this study in terms of alignment rate and sensitivity in line with performances reported for other organisms, for example humans.443.2. Variant calling and reconstruction of private sequencesSUPER-CAP allowed to detect 25,654 unfiltered variants in the targeted regions considered. Then the filtering procedure allowed to reduce the number of false positives/low-quality variants. Only variants exhibiting coverage higher than 6× and PHRED quality higher than 30 were selected. Even if a different threshold could be applied to the filtering procedure, we observed that in our experiment a depth coverage of six represented the minimum coverage to maximize the PHRED quality (Supplementary Fig. S2). Subsequent criteria were adopted to appropriately detect the number of He variants. A preliminary survey was carried out in order to estimate the number of He variants in accordance with the range of the AF (AF of mapped reads for each locus) (Supplementary Fig. S3). As expected, an inverse correlation between the range of AF and number of He variants was observed. This indicated that the set-up of the AF-range deeply affects the estimation of the He variants in the calling procedure. In order to make this sensitive phase of the variant calling easily customizable, we allow the SUPER-CAP user to set their own AF range. In this study, we set an AF range of 0.4-0.6 for the He variants, in line with a previous study in tomato.10 At this threshold, 86,120 variants in 14,116 sites were scored. Only 5% (4,970) of the total variants in 2,543 sites resulted to be He. Looking at the distribution of the He variants, we observed that they were not uniformly distributed across the chromosomes and genotypes. Chromosome 11 harboured the highest number of He variants per Mbp of captured region (Supplementary Fig. S4) while chromosomes 10 and 0 harboured the lowest number. Considering the 44 samples analysed, the heterozygosity ranged from 1.1 to 47% (Fig. 2), with a minimum value for sample 99A and a maximum value for sample 85A. Sample 85A showed an unexpected high percentage of residual heterozygosity, suggesting a possible sampling error of the plant material for this genotype (which could be mixed with other genotypes or to a residual segregation during the germoplasm conservation). For this reason, the sample was excluded from subsequent analyses. Figure 2Open in new tabDownload slideDistribution of variants detected for each genotype according to the type of variants.

A dendrogram built by using the complete set of variants shows the relationship among the genotypes.Figure 2 shows the number of variants detected for each sample, with respect to the proportion of SNPs and INDELs at both Ho and He level. Although INDELs are present at lower rates than SNPs, small INDELs represent functionally important types of genomic variation.47,48 It is reported that, compared with other sequencing technologies, Illumina does not appear to have high error rates in homopolymer regions.49 However, in this study the INDELs surveyed were obtained after discarding positions overlapping with homopolymers >7 bp, both in the tomato reference and in resequencing sequences. This allowed to avoid possible errors due to technical bias and enabled to collect a final high-quality set of variants.As a whole, the sample with the highest number of variants was 42A, which harbours >4,000 SNPs and about 1,000 INDELs. The sample with the lowest number of variants was 102A which exhibits 1,123 variants between SNPs and INDELs. On average, 1,357 SNPs per sample were scored, of which 6.8% turned out to be He. The average of INDELs per sample turned out to be about 600, and only 3% were He.The high depth of coverage reached in this experiment supported the detection of rare variants. It has been suggested that rare or low-frequency variants, which are not fully captured using other conventional genotyping technology, could largely contribute to explain the effects of some traits50 or to characterize their genetic architecture.51 In this study 5,441 Ho and 442 He genotype-specific variants were identified. Among these, 1,965 Ho and 216 He variants resulted still private variants when compared with external public repository for SNPs in tomato (360 tomato genomes42). This could be of interest when designing specific SNP markers or for studying the potential functionality of specific haplotypes in the landraces collection used in this survey. However, the rare variants identified alone do not seem to explain the phylogenetic differences observed (Fig. 2). The genetic divergence was associated with the high number of private alleles only in a few samples (i.e. 103A and 97A).The possibility of reconstructing private sequences from high-throughput resequencing data is still a challenge today.28 For this reason, the last step in the SUPER-CAP workflow allows to specifically insert the detected variants into the sequence of each sample. This step, which integrates the single information of the variants in a genotype-specific gene-based view, enables to obtain a necessary starting point for further functional validation analyses. In this study, a total of 16,254 regions (378*43), each including the gene and the related promoter region, were reconstructed. In order to easily exploit the combined effect of multiple variants in the same protein, reconstruction of the CDS was also performed. Future works, benefitting from this effort, will evaluate the combined effect of the variants for each gene in order to find relevant association with antioxidant content in tomato.3.3. Validation of variantsIn order to validate the variants detected, we performed a survey by exploring the available resources already present for tomato. About 8,600 variant sites detected in the present study overlapped with those reported in the genome resequencing data of 360 tomatoes.42 Most of the non-overlapping variants were excluded since they classified as rare variants in the experiment, being present only in specific samples. Moreover, by using nine common accessions, an analysis on the concordance of the variant calling was performed. Each of the nine samples shared a different number of variants, ranging from 191 to 985. Taking into account the Ho alternative variants only, an average of 95% concordance was found. Another validation was carried out by comparing SNPs detected on a tomato population genotyped using a SolCAP arrays,30,32 which included 7,720 SNPs. Only 170 of the 7,720 SNPs fall in the targeted region considered in the present study, since the targeted regions represent ~1% (378/34,725) of the tomato genes. Of these 170 SNPs, a subset of 97 belongs to common accessions and was used for validation. On average, a concordance >95% was observed. In most cases the discrepancies were genotyped as He either on the SolCAP array (2.5%) or in the Sequence capture (0.6%). When excluding the He cases, the similarity increased to 98%.3.4. CNV and PAVCNV and PAV have been recently reported as sources of important phenotypic variation in plants.52–54 The adequate depth coverage reached in this study allowed to hypothesize on the possible structural variations occurring among the samples considered. To do this, CNV and PAV analyses were performed to detect additional or deleted homologous loci of the 378 genes among the 43 samples, by analysing the normalized depth coverage of each sample. The comparison of read depths along the loci revealed at least 10 loci with a significant variation in depth in at least one line. In particular, nine genes (four Pectinesterases, two Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, one Reductase, one Inositol-3-phosphate synthase, one Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase) showed a CNV, and one gene (Dehydroascorbate reductase) showed a PAV (Supplementary Table S3). Three genes showed a putative reduction of the CNV (ratio <0.5) while six showed an increase (ratio >1.5). The very low number of reads captured for two samples (103A and 15A) for the gene Solyc09g056180 was associated with a PAV and we assumed that this gene was deleted in the two samples. In addition, an experimental validation by genomic PCR corroborated this result, highlighting that no amplification of the Solyc09g056180 was present for these two genotypes as showed in Supplementary Figure S5. The analysis of the coverage revealed a uniform high level of coverage across all the samples for seven genes (Solyc00g027770, Solyc00g282510, Solyc00g030510, Solyc02g075620, Solyc03g042560, Solyc03g036470, Solyc03g07 1860). Indeed, these seven genes showed levels of coverage ranging between 104.58× and 192.48×, representing an increase of two to four fold compared with the average coverage encountered among all the genes (53.89×). This could be due to the lack of regions in the current release of tomato. A high number of reads collapsing on specific regions could be caused by unassembled/misassembled regions in the genome.29 To validate this unexpected high coverage, we evaluated the depth of coverage of these genes in two further independent resequencing experiments (Heinz and Moneymaker) by using publicly available data (variation data from SGN databases). We observed that significant high coverage was obtained for three genes in at least one of the two resequencing experiments and one gene in both the resequencing experiments (data not shown). This corroborates that the reference genome could carry misleading sequences. An additional indication of this hypothesis, as also discussed below, come from the high ratio of He observed for these genes, showing that similar but not identical reads were mapped on the reference regions.3.5. Heterozygous variants into gene familiesHe variant assignments represent one crucial difficulty in sequence experiments.10,29,55 Since one of the causes of spurious He call was hypothesized to derive from duplicated genes, a specific investigation was carried out, aided by the high quality of variants detected by SUPER-CAP. Previous studies reported that false-positive signals could arise in regions with low complexity,56 or result from misalignment of multiple copies of genes, paralogues, or pseudogenes57 but, to our knowledge, no study has analysed the behaviour of the He variants in the gene family context.In our collection, 235 out 378 genes completely represent 25 gene families. In particular, 171 genes belong to eight large gene families, 40 belong to seven medium gene families, 24 belong to 10 small gene families and six are single copy genes. In order to estimate the number of He variants in each group we evaluated (Fig. 3) the average He density (number of He variants for Kbp) for each gene family. On average, a lower number of He variants was identified in the single genes compared with the gene family groups. Significant differences were observed at t-test between single genes and Large, Medium and Small gene families (P = 0.007) but not among gene families themselves (P > 0.05). Although these results evidence that gene families, despite the number of copies, are more prone to produce He variants compared with single genes, the high standard deviation detected showed that differences seem to be associated with specific cases in each gene family and not due to a general behaviour. It appears evident that in each gene family only specific genes showed a very high level of heterozygosity in almost all the genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S6). In particular it was evident that Solyc00g282510, Solyc03g042560, Solyc00g027770 and Solyc01g091060 (belonging to large gene families) and Solyc12g098090 (belonging to a medium gene family) showed a skewed rate of He variants. Some possible explanations of this result were hypothesized. In particular, exploring if neighbouring regions of these genes showed a similar rate of heterozygosity (by using information from the 360 genome project), we evidenced that a similar high rate of He variants was found only for Solyc03g042560 in a region spanning ~300 Kbp.

He density is expressed as the average number of He variants for 10 Kbp. Bar errors represent SD of the mean.Another source of false positive He variants might be due to duplicated regions found in the samples that are not found in the reference genome. In such cases, the variants will be due to reads from the two copies (or more) that are piled in the only copy found in the reference genome. Such biases could occur because of the limited number of genotypes on which the original reference sequence was based, or sequencing and alignment errors (Lander et al., 2001). Fortunately, these cases can be highlighted looking at excesses of depth of coverage. Three out of the five genes (Solyc00g282510, Solyc00g027770, Solyc01g091060) exhibiting a high He density showed a high depth of coverage in parallel (as also evidenced in the previous paragraph), generally doubled or tripled in comparison to the average value of all the samples. This proves that the tomato reference genome might carry misleading sequences for those regions and that the He calls observed are likely to be false-positives.3.6. Variants classification and annotationAs an additional step, the functional annotation of the variants has also been investigated by using SnpEff and SNPsift programs. The SNPs discovered were classified according to their type (transition vs transversion and insertions vs deletion) and the genomic region they were found in. A significant number of the SNPs discovered (6,098, 44.2%) were located in the genic region and, among these, about 21% were found within exons, 73% within introns, 1.73% within the 5'-UTR and 3.68% within the 3'-UTR (Fig. 4). The remaining 7,674 (55.8%) were found to be within the promoter region. Considering the number of variants per Kbp, eight variants per Kbp were found in the promoter region on average, while only 2.2 variants per Kbp were found in the exonic regions. Introns and UTRs showed more than double the number of variants per Kbp compared with exonic regions. Genic and intergenic variants were classified as transition/transversion and insertion/deletion typologies. Transitions represent approximately 64.54% of all post-filtered SNPs (11,495), with 44.2% (5,160) of them being located in genic regions. Deletions in average were more represented than insertions, particularly in promoter and intron regions. Then, the 6,098 variants of the genic regions were annotated according to their putative effect on the protein by using SnpEff v4 (Table 2). The goal of annotating variants is to provide a prediction of which ones are functionally relevant. Our detected variants were assigned to a diverse range of functional classes, with the majority (78%) classified as ‘modifier’, therefore without predictable effects being located in the UTR regions or in the introns. These may have little or no effect on the phenotype. Among the remaining variants, about 12% showed a ‘low effect’, since they were variants in coding regions that did not change the amino acid sequence (synonymous variant). About 9% showed a ‘moderate’ effect. These variants are predominantly non-synonymous amino acid changes (missense variant) and in few cases in-frame deletion/insertion. They are the most likely candidates for causal mutations, since they could alter the structure and function of relevant proteins. Last, about 1% of the variants were predicted to have a ‘high effect’. In particular, 14 variants were predicted to cause a frameshift: two of them a splice site acceptor modification, and nine and three a start or stop codon gain or loss, respectively. On average, we observed that the percentage of INDELs with ‘high effect’ was higher than for SNPs, since an INDEL may rapidly cause a frameshift in the sequence. The list of the variant with a moderate or a high effect with respect to the gene they affected is provided in Supplementary Table S4.

The variants selected or prioritized in this way would be highly preferred marker sets to be subjected to association studies using suitably larger populations, for which panels with considerable genotype and phenotype information has already been collected.30,32The authors wish to thank the Genomix4Life S.r.l (http://www.genomix4life.com) for the genotyping analyses performed with ILLUMINA Infinium Technology.Conflict of interestNone declared.

To understand the molecular basis of chromosome structure in lampreys, we performed chromosome C-banding and silver staining and chromosome mapping of the 18S–28S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and telomeric TTAGGG repeats in the Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum). In addition, we cloned chromosome site-specific repetitive DNA sequences and characterized them by nucleotide sequencing, chromosome in situ hybridization, and filter hybridization. Three types of repetitive sequences were detected; a 200-bp AT-rich repetitive sequence, LCA-EcoRIa that co-localized with the 18S–28S rRNA gene clusters of 3 chromosomal pairs; a 364-bp AT-rich LCA-EcoRIb sequence that showed homology to the EcoRI sequence family from the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which contains short repeats as centromeric motifs; and a GC-rich 702-bp LCA-ApaI sequence that was distributed on nearly all chromosomes and showed significant homology with the integrase-coding region of a Ty3/Gypsy family long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon. All three repetitive sequences are highly conserved within the Petromyzontidae or within Petromyzontidae and Mordaciidae. Molecular cytogenetic characterization of these site-specific repeats showed that they may be correlated with programed genome rearrangement (LCA-EcoRIa), centromere structure and function (LCA-EcoRIb), and site-specific amplification of LTR retroelements through homogenization between non-homologous chromosomes (LCA-ApaI).1. IntroductionLampreys (Petromyzontiformes) and hagfishes (Myxiniformes), which are known as cyclostomes or agnathans, occupy a basal position in the phylogeny of extant vertebrates and possess anatomical and developmental features that are quite different from those of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Therefore, these animals are excellent models for understanding the evolution of vertebrates in a wide range of scientific <U+FB01>elds, including genomics, immunology, endocrinology, neurobiology, and developmental biology. Molecular phylogenetic analyses have shown that extant lampreys and hagfishes diverged from the common ancestors of jawless vertebrates ~480 million years ago (MYA).1–3 All extant lamprey species are classified into a single order, Petromyzontiformes, which is composed of three families, Geotriidae, Mordaciidae, and Petromyzontidae.4 Geotriidae and Mordaciidae are distributed in the southern hemisphere, whereas Petromyzontidae are distributed in the Northern Hemisphere.5,6 Their karyotypes are very different from those of other vertebrates and are characterized by almost all dot-shaped chromosomes (regarded as microchromosomes). Species of Geotriidae and Petromyzontidae have 142–184 chromosomes, whereas Mordaciidae species have 76 chromosomes.7–14 However, the chromosome number in hagfishes is much smaller and variable (2n = 14, 28, 34, or 36).11,13 The GC-content of 4-fold degenerate sites (GC4) in the protein-coding regions also differ greatly between lampreys and hagfishes; GC4 is much higher in lampreys than in hagfishes.2 These results suggested that drastic chromosomal and genomic rearrangements occurred in either or both of the lineages after divergence from the common ancestor of cyclostomes.13Highly repetitive DNA sequences are classified into two categories based on their genomic organization and chromosomal distribution.15 The first category consists of interspersed repetitive sequences such as short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), which are distributed throughout the genome. The second category is chromosome site-specific and highly repetitive sequences such as satellite DNA, which are associated with constitutive or centromeric heterochromatin. Chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences generally show a high rate of nucleotide substitution and are divergent between even closely related species.16,17 Thus, identification and comparison of site-specific repetitive sequences aids in tracing the evolutionary process of speciation. An EcoRI family of satellite DNA sequences identified in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus (Petromyzontidae) was the first reported in lampreys18 and was shown to be distributed in the centromeric regions of 12 or 34 chromosomes.14,18 This repetitive sequence has high AT content and contains short repeat units. Sequences from the same family of EcoRI satellite DNA were later identified in two other Petromyzontidae species Lampetra planeri and Lampetra zanandreai, and these DNA sequences were localized to only two chromosomes in La. zanandreai.12 In lampreys, molecular and cytogenetic characterization of chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences is limited to this EcoRI satellite DNA.The Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum, Petromyzontidae) is the most common and widespread lamprey in the arctic region from Lapland in the north to Kamchatka in the east and Japan and Korea in the south. To our knowledge, there has been only one study on the karyotype of this species, whose chromosome number has been reported to range from 144 to 162.19 In this study, we aimed to characterize the molecular basis of its chromosome structure through conventional and molecular cytogenetic approaches and to clone chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences associated with the heterochromatin of Le. camtschaticum. We performed conventional Giemsa staining of chromosomes, chromosome banding (C-banding and silver staining), and chromosome mapping of the 18S–28S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and telomeric TTAGGG repeats. Next, we isolated three different chromosome site-specific repetitive sequences, determined their nucleotide sequences and chromosomal distribution, and examined the conservation of these nucleotide sequences in other lamprey species. Based on the results, we discuss the process of chromosomal evolution in lampreys.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsThe Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum; synonym Le. japonicum, Petromyzontidae) was used for chromosome preparation and molecular cloning of repetitive sequences. After decapitation of two male and three female Le. camtschaticum, 5 ml of whole blood was collected from each individual in a test tube containing 20 µl of sodium heparin (final concentration: 10 IU/ml) (Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) from each individual using a syringe and was used for cell culture and extraction of genomic DNA. All experimental procedures using animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Animal Care Committee of Hokkaido University.2.2. Lymphocyte cultureHeparinized blood of Le. camtschaticum was added to Medium 199 (Thermo Fisher Scientific-Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 60 µg/ml kanamycin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a ratio of 1:5. After centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min, lymphocytes were obtained with a sterile Pasteur pipette from the buffy coat layer that is situated between the plasma and erythrocyte layers. The lymphocytes were suspended in culture medium [Medium 199 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma-Aldrich), 18 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin, M form (Thermo Fisher Scientific-Gibco), 60 µg/ml kanamycin sulfate, and 1% of Antibiotic–Antimycotic liquid (PSA, Thermo Fisher Scientific-Gibco)] and cultured in plastic bottles at 20 °C under CO2-free condition.2.3. Chromosome preparation and bandingLymphocytes were cultured for 6 days and exposed to 500 ng/ml colcemid for 2.5 h before harvest. The cells were collected by centrifugation (300×g, 7 min) and treated with 0.075 M KCl for 20 min at room temperature. The suspension was then fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and spread on clean glass slides using an air-drying method. For karyotyping, the slides were stained with 3% Giemsa solution (pH 6.8) for 10 min. The chromosomes were counted on printed pictures using a colony counter. C-bands were obtained by the barium hydroxide/saline/Giemsa (BSG) method.20 C-banding and Ag-NOR staining21 were performed on slides previously used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.2.4. Molecular cloning of repetitive sequenceExtraction of genomic DNA and molecular cloning of repetitive sequences were performed as previously described.22 Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and DNA bands containing repetitive sequences were isolated from the gel and cloned into vectors. After the nucleotide sequences of the cloned repetitive sequences were obtained, their chromosome distribution, genomic organization, and sequence conservation in other lamprey species were examined. For detailed information, see Supplementary data.2.5. Molecular phylogenyPhylogenetic trees of the repetitive DNA sequences were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method as implemented in MEGA 6.0 software.23 We used the Kimura-2-parameter model for nucleotide sequences and the Poisson model for amino acid sequences with Gamma distribution parameter a = 4 for rates and pattern settings. The bootstrap branch-supporting statistic was calculated for 1,000 replicates.2.6. FISHTo examine the chromosomal distribution of the repetitive sequences isolated in this study, 18S–28S and 5S rRNA genes, and telomeric TTAGGG repeats, FISH analysis was performed as previously described.24 For detailed information, see Supplementary data.2.7. Hybridization analysis of DNA blotsThe genomic organization of repetitive sequences and their sequence conservation were examined by Southern blot hybridization and slot-blot hybridization, respectively. For detailed methods, see Supplementary data.3. Results3.1. Karyotype of Le. camtschaticum and the chromosomal location of the major rRNA genes and telomeric repeat sequencesFigure 1A shows a Giemsa-stained metaphase spread of Le. camtschaticum, which consists of mostly small acrocentric or dot-shaped chromosomes and several pairs of small submetacentric chromosomes. The modal diploid chromosome number for 81 metaphase spreads was 168 (Supplementary Table S1). We collected chromosome samples from five individuals (two males and three females), and no differences in chromosome number and size were found between males and females. C-banding detected distinctive C-positive heterochromatin blocks on ~30 pairs of chromosomes (Fig. 1B and C). Large C-bands were localized to the centromeric regions of the largest pair of submetacentric chromosomes and the centromeric regions of three other pairs of chromosomes. Distinctive C-bands were also located in other many small acrocentric and dot-shaped chromosomes.

To identify the active sites of the 18S–28S rRNA genes, we performed silver staining on the same chromosome slides used for FISH analysis of the 18S–28S rRNA genes.25 Ag-NORs were observed in the pericentromeric region of one submetacentric chromosome pair, but not on the other four acrocentric chromosomes bearing 18S–28S rRNA signals (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Only slight variations in the size of the Ag-NOR signals were observed among the individuals examined (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The 5S rDNA signals were detected on a single pair of small chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1D), which was different from the chromosomes on which the 18S–28S rRNA signals and C-positive bands were localized (data not shown). FISH signals for TTAGGG repeat sequences were detected on the terminal ends of all chromosomes, and there were large differences in the size of signals between chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1E).3.2. Nucleotide sequences of the repetitive sequence families in the Le. camtschaticum genomeWe isolated repetitive sequences of the Le. camtschaticum genome by agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA digested with restriction endonucleases (Supplementary Fig. S2). Nine clones obtained from a 200-bp EcoRI band were grouped into the same repetitive sequence family, named LCA-EcoRIa (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The lengths of the nine fragments (LC149791–LC149799) were 200–202 bp, and the sequence similarity between the fragments ranged from 93.7 to 100.0%. The average GC content of the fragments was 47.5% (range 47.0–48.0%). Another EcoRI sequence family, LCA-EcoRIb, was isolated from a 360-bp EcoRI band (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The length of all 11 isolated fragments (LC149800–LC149810) was 364 bp, and the sequence similarity between fragments ranged from 96.1 to 99.7%. The sequences were AT-rich, and the average GC content was 41.5% (range 40.4–42.0%). Seven clones of the LCA-ApaI sequence family were isolated from a 700-bp ApaI band. The lengths of the seven fragments (LC149811–LC149817) ranged from 700 to 702 bp, and the consensus length was 702 bp (Supplementary Fig. S3C). The sequence similarity between the fragments ranged from 91.3 to 99.4%. In contrast to the LCA-EcoRIa and LCA-EcoRIb sequences, the LCA-ApaI sequences were GC-rich, and the average GC content was 57.2% (range 56.7–57.8%).3.3. Similarity of the repetitive sequence families to other nucleotide sequencesHomology searches using the three repetitive sequence families were performed using the NCBI non-redundant sequence database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Repbase (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/).26 The 200-bp LCA-EcoRIa consensus sequence showed high sequence identity with the nucleotide sequence of a BAC clone (KF318012) isolated from this species, with 94.5% identity at positions 6–205 and 97.6% identity from 206 to 371 in KF318012. The search also identified two partial sequences in a tandem repeat element, rpt200, in Germ1 (GQ215662) of P. marinus, which is a genomic DNA sequence that is eliminated from germ cells by a programmed genome rearrangement.27 The sequences showed 76.8% identity at positions 5,133–5,283 (named as the rpt200_1 fragment) and 80.9% identity at positions 7,489–7,556 (rpt200_2) in the rpt200 element (Fig. 2A). The LCA-EcoRIb consensus sequence showed 84.8, 89.4, and 89.1% identity to the EcoRI family of satellite DNA sequences in P. marinus (X92515), La. planeri, and La. zanandreai, respectively (Fig. 2B).12,18 Short repeats, such as centromeric motifs, that appear in the centromeric sequences of several eukaryotic species,28–31 were detected in the consensus sequences of LCA-EcoRIb as well as the EcoRI satellite DNA sequences of the three lamprey species12,18 (Fig. 2B). A search using the LCA-ApaI sequence identified a partial sequence of the P. marinus long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon Gypsy-26_PM-I in Repbase (Fig. 2C). A search using the InterProScan tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) revealed that LCA-ApaI shared 70.7% identity with a partial region of the integrase domain at position 4,252–4,954 of Gypsy-26_PM-I (Fig. 3).

Chromosomal distribution of the repetitive sequencesLCA-EcoRIa 2 (LC149792), LCA-EcoRIb 4 (LC149803), and LCA-ApaI 1 (LC149811) fragments were used for FISH analysis as representative probes of each repetitive sequence family. The results showed that the LCA-EcoRIa sequences were localized to the pericentromeric regions of six chromosomes (Fig. 4A), and the hybridization signals completely overlapped the signals for the 18S–28S rRNA genes (Fig. 4B and C). Hybridization signals for the LCA-EcoRIb sequence were observed in the centromeric regions of six chromosomes (Fig. 4D), which differed from the chromosomes bearing the 18S–28S rRNA genes (Fig. 4E and F). The LCA-ApaI sequence was localized to the centromeric and/or pericentromeric regions of almost all chromosomes. C-band positive bands were also located in the centromeric regions of many small acrocentric and dot-shaped chromosomes (Fig. 1B and C), indicating that the C-positive heterochromatin regions overlapped or partially overlapped the signals of LCA-ApaI sequence. However, the size of signals differed among the chromosomes (Fig. 4G and H). The signals were generally located in the centromeric regions on PI-positive blocks and/or in pericentromeric regions. Approximately 10 chromosomes showed large signals, and several large submetacentric chromosomes had more than 1 hybridization site. Two-color FISH analysis of LCA-ApaI and the 18S–28S rRNA genes showed that the LCA-ApaI sequences were located adjacent to the 18S–28S rRNA gene cluster but hardly overlapped it (Fig. 4I). However, the LCA-ApaI signals partially overlapped the LCA-EcoRIb signals (Fig. 4J). Figure 4Open in new tabDownload slideChromosomal distribution of the LCA-EcoRI and LCA-ApaI sequences.

LCA-EcoRIb 4 (LC149803) and LCA-ApaI 1 (LC149811) fragments were used as probes.3.5. Molecular phylogeny of the LCA-EcoRIb and LCA-ApaI sequencesWe performed phylogenetic analyses to examine the evolutionary relationships between the LCA-EcoRIb sequence and the EcoRI satellite sequences of other lamprey species as well as the LCA-ApaI sequence and Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons of other species (Supplementary Fig. S4). No sequences homologous to LCA-EcoRIa were found other than the rpt200 sequence of P. marinus; therefore, we did not perform molecular phylogenetic analysis of this sequence. NJ tree analysis of the EcoRI satellite repeats of lampreys revealed that all fragments of LCA-EcoRIb formed a clade supported by a high bootstrap value (100%), which was distinct from the clade containing the other three lamprey species (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Phylogenetic analysis of the LCA-ApaI sequences was performed using sequences encoding the integrase domain of the LTR retrotransposons obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; Supplementary Table S2), most of which were used in a previous phylogenetic study.32 A close phylogenetic relationship between the LCA-ApaI sequences and Gypsy-26_PM-I of P. marinus was supported by a high bootstrap value (100%; Supplementary Fig. S4B).3.6. Genomic organization of the repetitive sequencesFISH data revealed that LCA-EcoRIa is located in the spacer region of the 18S–28S rRNA gene cluster and tandem duplicated with the 18S–28S rDNA; therefore, we did not study the genomic organization of this repeated sequence. To examine the organization of the LCA-EcoRIb and LCA-ApaI sequences in the Le. camtschaticum genome, we performed Southern blot hybridizations using genomic DNA digested with AluI, ApaI, EcoRI, HpaII, MspI, and PstI (Supplementary Fig. S5). In a blot probed with LCA-EcoRIb, polymeric ladder bands of the 364-bp monomer units were detected in the EcoRI and AluI digests, which are characteristic of tandem repeat satellite DNA sequences (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Additional hybridization bands were observed interstitially in the ladder bands of the 364-bp monomer units in the AluI digests, which were derived from internal AluI cleavage sites in the monomer unit (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In contrast to the EcoRI and AluI digests, intense hybridization signals were observed at higher molecular weights in the ApaI, PstI, and MspI (HpaII) digests, indicating that these restriction sites are not highly conserved. Genomic DNA digested with the methylation-sensitive HpaII and methylation-insensitive MspI enzymes produced the same hybridization patterns, which indicates that their cleavage sites are not methylated.Hybridization with LCA-ApaI also resulted in a ladder of signals consisting of multiples of the 702-bp monomer in the ApaI digest (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The intensity of ladder bands increased for higher-order repeating structures, indicating that the ApaI site was less conserved in the tandem arrays. In contrast, AluI and MspI sites in the tandem arrays were highly conserved because no multimeric bands were detected in the AluI and MspI digests. The hybridization bands at lower molecular weight than the 702-bp band in the AluI and MspI digests were derived from the internal cleavage sites contained in the monomer unit (Supplementary Fig. 3C). The interstitial band positioned between the monomeric and dimeric bands in the ApaI digest suggested that the ApaI site was highly conserved in another additional unit of the LCA-ApaI sequence. The hybridization bands smaller than the monomer unit were observed in the MspI digest, whereas higher molecular weight bands were observed in the HpaII digest blot, indicating that the LCA-ApaI sequence was highly methylated.3.7. Sequence conservation of the repetitive sequencesConservation of the LCA-EcoRIb and LCA-ApaI sequences was examined by slot-blot hybridization using genomic DNA from four Petromyzontiformes species [Le. camtschaticum and P. marinus (Petromyzontidae), Geotria australis (Geotriidae), and Mordacia mordax (Mordaciidae)], inshore hagfish (Eptatretus burgeri, Myxinidae, Myxiniformes), lesser spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula, Scyliorhinidae, Carcharhiniformes), and medaka (Oryzias latipes, Adrianichthyidae, Beloniformes) (Fig. 5). Using the LCA-EcoRIb probe, intense chemiluminescent hybridization signals were detected in P. marinus, which is in the same family (Petromyzontidae) as Le. camtschaticum. No signals were detected in the other species (Fig. 5A). Using the LCA-ApaI probe, an intense hybridization signal was detected in Le. camtschaticum, and less intense signals were observed in P. marinus and M. mordax (Fig. 5B).

DiscussionHere, we determined the chromosome number and C-banded karyotype of Le. camtschaticum in somatic cells obtained from lymphocyte cultures. The diploid chromosome number was 168, which was not consistent with that reported in a previous study (2n = 144–162).19 This discrepancy may be due to technical artifacts owing to the extremely small size and high number of tiny chromosomes in lampreys. The chromosome number of Le. camtschaticum determined in this study was similar to those reported in somatic cells of Lampetra (La. fluviatilis [2n = 164], La. lamottenii [2n = 166], La. planeri [2n = 164], La. zanandreai [2n = 164]),8,12 and Petromyzon marinus (2n = 164–168).7,10,14 C-positive bands were distributed in the centromeric regions of ~30 pairs of chromosomes, which was more than the 20 pairs reported in La. zanandreai.12 In this study, the 18S–28S rRNA genes were localized to six chromosomes; however, the gene copies were only active in a single pair of submetacentric chromosomes. In other species, the 18S–28S rRNA genes were localized to the pericentromeric regions of four and two chromosomes in somatic cells of La. zanandreai12 and P marinus,14 respectively. These results suggest that the chromosomal location of the 18S–28S rRNA genes in lampreys is variable. However, the chromosomal location of the 5S rRNA genes has not been reported for any other lampreys than Le. camtschaticum, in which, these genes are localized to two chromosomes. The 5S rRNA genes are generally localized to a single pair of chromosomes in fishes, amphibians, and mammals,33 suggesting that chromosomal distribution of the 5S rRNA genes is conserved in vertebrates.We isolated three families of repetitive sequences from Le. camtschaticum, two AT-rich sequences (LCA-EcoRIa and LCA-EcoRIb) and one GC-rich sequence (LCA-ApaI). The LCA-EcoRIa sequence, which co-localized with the 18S–28S rDNA, showed significant homology with the tandem rpt200 repeat of P. marinus. This sequence is located in the spacer regions between the intact 18S rDNA and fragmented 28S rDNA sequences in P. marinus, which are found in the Germ1 sequence (GQ215662) that is eliminated from germ cells by a programmed genome rearrangement.27 In the primary spermatocytes of P. marinus (2n = 198) at meiotic prophase I, FISH signals for rpt200 and 28S rDNA were distributed on about 20/99 and 10/99 chromosome pairs, respectively, and the signals co-localized on some chromosomes.14 However, in somatic cells of P. marinus (2n = 164–168), the rpt200 signals were localized to ~14 pairs of chromosomes, and 28S rDNA signals were observed on only one pair of chromosomes, to which the rpt200 signal co-localized.14 This result indicates that most 18S–28S rDNA copies and several rpt200 copies are eliminated in somatic cells.14,27 The germline DNA loss in somatic cells has also been reported in the Korean lamprey (Lampetra morii, Petromyzontidae) recently.34 Therefore, the presence and co-localization of the rpt200-related LCA-EcoRIa sequence and 18S–28S rDNA in a small number of chromosome pairs in somatic cells of Le. camtschaticum might be related to a programmed genome rearrangement in this species.The LCA-EcoRIb sequence is a homolog of an EcoRI satellite DNA sequence that has been isolated from three lamprey species (La. planeri, La. zanandreai, and P. marinus).12,18 These AT-rich EcoRI sequence families, including LCA-EcoRIb, range from 362 to 370 bp, and the sequence divergence between LCA-EcoRIb and the EcoRI satellite DNAs is relatively low (10.6–15.2%). These sequences contain short repeats, such as centromeric motifs, which are also observed in the centromeric sequences of several eukaryotic species such as bream, trout, mouse, and human,28–31 suggesting that these satellite DNAs and the LCA-EcoRIb sequence could be important for centromere structure and function in lampreys. A zoo-blot hybridization revealed that the EcoRIb sequence is conserved within Petromyzontidae, and it is distributed on six chromosomes in the somatic cells of Le. camtschaticum, on two chromosomes in La. zanandreai,12 and on 34 chromosomes in P. marinus.14 These results suggest that the EcoRI satellite sequence might have been acquired in the Petromyzontidae lineage and amplified on many more chromosomes in Petromyzon than in Lampetra and Lethenteron through homogenization between non-homologous chromosomes, called concerted evolution (reviewed in Elder and Turner35 and Plohl et al.36).A search of RepBase revealed that the LCA-ApaI sequence showed significant homology with a partial integrase-coding region of the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon of P. marinus (Gypsy-26_PM-I), indicating that the LCA-ApaI sequence might be a LTR retrotransposon-derived repeat. LTR retrotransposons of the Ty3/Gypsy superfamily have been isolated from fungi, plants, and animals.37–39 The results of the slot-blot analysis indicate that the LCA-ApaI sequence is well conserved in Petromyzontidae and Mordaciidae, but not in Geotriidae. Mordaciidae, which is distributed in the southern hemisphere, has a lower chromosome number (2n = 76) than Petromyzontidae (2n = 142–174) in the northern hemisphere and Geotriidae (~180 chromosomes) in the southern hemisphere, suggesting that extensive centric fusions occurred in Mordaciidae.9,13 Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested that Mordaciidae is in a separate clade from Petromyzontidae and Geotriidae,40–43 which is reflected by the difference in chromosome numbers between Petromyzontidae/Geotriidae and Mordaciidae. The phylogenetic relationship among these three families strongly suggests that the LCA-ApaI sequence appeared in the common ancestor of Petromyzontiformes and amplified in Petromyzontidae and Mordaciidae but not in Geotriidae, in which no hybridization signal was detected by slot blot, although it is also possible that the LCA-ApaI sequence disappeared in the Geotriidae lineage.A draft genome assembly of P. marinus has been reported, and 7,752 distinct families of repetitive sequences were identified, accounting for 34.7% of the genome.44 The genome sequence of P. marinus will facilitate cloning of repetitive sequences from another lamprey species and their comparison, which is needed to provide further insights into the molecular basis of chromosome structure and evolution in lampreys.Accession numbersLC149791–LC149817Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (No. 23113004) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (No. 22370081) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.
