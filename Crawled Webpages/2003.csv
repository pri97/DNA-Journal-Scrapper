To create a reliable and comprehensive data set for the elucidation of transcription regulation networks, we conducted systematic genome-wide disruption expression experiments of yeast on 118 genes with known involvement in transcription regulation. We report several novel regulatory relationships between known transcription factors and other genes with previously unknown biological function discovered with this expression library. Here we report the downstream regulatory subnetworks for UME6 and MET28 . The elucidated network topology among these genes demonstrates MET28 's role as a nodal point between genes involved in cell division and those involved in DNA repair mechanisms.

Chlamydial Inc proteins are known to be a major component of the inclusion membrane, but little is known about the gene number and function. The Inc proteins share very low sequence similarity but a similar hydropathy profile among them. Using the hydropathy profile, we computationally searched the open reading frames (ORFs) having a similar profile and predicted 90 and 36 ORFs (Inc-like ORFs) as candidates for Inc proteins in Chlamydia pneumoniae J138 and Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D, respectively. On the other hand, only a few Inc-like ORFs were found in organisms other than chlamydiae, suggesting that the Inc-like ORFs are specific to chlamydiae. Comparative genome analysis also revealed that the Inc-like ORFs have multiplied and diverged as paralogues and orthologues in the chlamydial genomes, and that some Inc-like ORFs lacked the N-terminal portion or encoded the split form. The data suggest that these gene products constitute a large protein family and may play an important role in chlamydial infection, growth and survival in the host cell.

By using a random oligonucleotide selection assay and the electromobility gel shift assay, we have revealed that the ZNF219 protein recognizes two copies of CCCCCA. The DNA binding core element is CCCCC. 3′ flanking A residues enhance binding of the ZNF219 protein. Use of the various truncated ZNF219 constructs demonstrated that zinc finger 1 to 3 or zinc finger 5 and 6 domains are sufficient to allow specific DNA binding.

This array was used as a probe to hybridize target RNAs prepared from normally grown callus of rice and from callus treated for 6 hr or 3 days with the hormones abscisic acid (ABA) or gibberellin (GA). We identified 509 clones, including many clones that had never been annotated as ABA- or GA-responsive. These genes included not only ABA- or GA-responsive genes but also genes responsive to other physiological conditions such as pathogen infection, heat shock, and metal ion stress. Comparison of ABA- and GA-responsive genes revealed antagonistic regulation for these genes by both hormones except for one defense-related gene, thionin. The gene for thionin was up-regulated by both hormone treatments for 3 days. The upstream regions of all the genes that were regulated by both hormones had cis -elements for ABA and GA response. We performed a clustering analysis of genes regulated by both hormones and various expression profiles that showed three notable clusters (seed tissues, low temperature and sugar starvation, and thionin-gene related). A comparison of the cis -elements for hormone response genes between rice and Arabidopsis thaliana , we identified cis -elements for dehydration-stress response or for expression of amylase gene as Arabidopsis gene-specific or rice gene-specific, respectively.

Two strains that are commonly used in gene-targeting research today are the 129 substrains, which are used to produce ES cell lines, and C57BL/6J, which is used for the extensive backcrosses required to produce isogenic knockout mice. When F 2 nonisogenic littermates are assessed using DNA microarrays, one must determine whether the expression profiles obtained resulted either from specific alteration(s) induced by the targeted gene mutation or from gene expression differences related to the genetic background of the parent mouse strains. In the present study, we report the differential expression profile of genes expressed in neonatal brains and adult spleen and liver of 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J strains of mice. These comprehensive profiles were assessed using two types of Agilent Mouse Oligo Microarrays (development and standard) and were compiled into a publicly available database. Researchers can use this database to determine whether their microarray findings represent strain-specific differences in gene expression by comparing their data with those cataloged in our database. This database is useful for effectively analyzing DNA microarray data from nonisogenic littermates, and would help researchers avoid time-consuming backcrosses and confirmatory experiments requiring the use of many mice.
