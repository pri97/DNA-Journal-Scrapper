IntroductionPerennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is one of the most widely cultivated grass species in Europe. It is of interest for grazing, hay and silage production as it has a long growing season, and relatively high yield and nutritive value. Because of its outbreeding nature, individual plants are highly heterozygous and the diploid perennial ryegrass genome is highly heterogeneous both within and across breeding populations and wild accessions. As genomic variation forms the foundation of phenotypic variation, revealing DNA sequence variation within the genepool is important for genetic analysis and development of breeding applications.1Several studies used a candidate gene-based approach to associate sequence polymorphisms with phenotypic variation. Examples include the association of Late embryogenesis abundant 3 (LEA3) with drought tolerance,2,Brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) with shoot morphology,3,Gibberellic acid insensitive (GAI) with organ growth,4,Heading date 1 (HD1) with carbohydrate content5 and Flowering locus T (FT) with flowering time.5–7 While these studies show the power of testing gene–trait associations, the limited number of genes per study was mostly due to the high cost of genotyping at the time. However, this approach is not amenable to study complex traits related to plant development and phenology, which are typically regulated by the interaction of many genes. Therefore, we need versatile and cost-efficient methods to characterize the genetic variation in parallel for hundreds of candidate genes and hundreds of genotypes. This enables breeders to perform higher resolution screening of genetic diversity in their material and link genotypic and phenotypic variation.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most prevalent type of genomic variation and are convenient molecular markers. Two complementary SNP genotyping arrays are available for high-throughput screening in perennial ryegrass.8,9 These arrays target SNPs in genic regions, but do not allow discovery of new sequence variants. In contrast, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) allows for simultaneous discovery of genome-wide SNPs and genotyping of a large number of individuals or pools, thereby avoiding ascertainment bias. Therefore, GBS has broad applications in plant breeding and genetics studies, including linkage maps, genome-wide association studies, genomic selection and genomic diversity studies.10 Only short fragments (range about 100–300 bp) are sequenced and there is no a priori control over which genes are tagged. In combination with a local short linkage disequilibrium that is typical for an outbreeding species as L. perenne,3,11 it can be very difficult to identify SNPs that are causal for the phenotype of interest.The large size of the L. perenne genome (2 Gbp) and high repetitive sequence content (76%)12 currently precludes whole genome sequencing at sufficient depth in hundreds of accessions as has been done in e.g. Arabidopsis, rice and soybean. To study trait genetics in forage and turf grasses, we identified hundreds of candidate genes in genetic pathways that control plant development and quality traits, and analysed their genome sequence using probe capture enrichment for targeted resequencing in a large germplasm collection of 736 genotypes. We specifically focussed on genes involved in pathways related to interesting agronomic traits, such as plant growth and architecture (important for biomass yield), development and transition to flowering (important for seasonal control of growth), cell wall biogenesis (important for digestibility) and phytohormone biosynthesis, signalling and response [including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellic acid and strigolactones]. Identifying sequence variants in these genes provides insights in the range of naturally occurring genomic diversity that can be expected in gene-rich regions of the genome. The variants can be used as markers for association genetics studies (as previously described for LEA3, BRI1, GAI, HD1 and FT3), and/or to identify alleles with altered amino acid sequence, mRNA splicing or mRNA stability, hence altered gene function or regulation possibly resulting in an altered physiology and thereby affecting the phenotype.Multiple bioinformatics methods are available to identify sequence variants using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, but defining a complete and reliable variant set remains difficult. De novo discovery of genomic polymorphisms commonly relies on mapping reads to a single reference genome sequence. Although the GATK best practices are the most commonly used variant calling (VC) pipeline, there is no single best VC pipeline available with both good sensitivity and precision. Moreover, there is low concordance between VC pipelines, even with the same input data.13–16 In addition, each VC pipeline returns different variant annotations that can be used for quality filtering. Choosing the appropriate filtering criteria and thresholds [for instance, minimum read depth (RD)] is not straightforward as NGS data typically has a non-uniform distribution of coverage17 and estimated quality values may be dataset dependent so that optimal settings need to be calibrated for each dataset. The high density of sequence polymorphisms in the germplasm collection with respect to the L. perenne genome sequence could also hamper variant identification. More divergent alleles could contain the most interesting genomic variation, but are also the most difficult to detect as reads that are highly divergent from the reference genome may fail to map if the parameters for short read alignment are too stringent.18 Hence, if capture and/or mapping efficiency of highly divergent sequences precludes their detection, it is to be expected that routine workflows of mapping and VC lead to an underestimation of the genetic diversity at highly divergent regions, a known problem in genome resequencing studies.19Here, we present the identification and annotation of 503 L. perenne orthologues of known genes that regulate plant growth and development. These genes were resequenced in a germplasm collection of 736 genotypes to describe the genomic variation in L. perenne. Two complementary strategies were used to obtain a reliable and complete catalogue of genomic variation. First, four VC pipelines were compared and automatically integrated to reach maximal sensitivity. The influence of mapping algorithms was assessed and hard filtering was compared with precision-based filtering to reach sufficient specificity. Additionally, an alternative strategy consisting of de novo assembly followed by overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) clustering was used to circumvent read mapping bias and to construct alternative alleles for each gene. This reference independent allele reconstruction is particularly important for gene families with highly divergent alleles. We demonstrated the benefit of this approach for LpSDUF247 and identified 28 novel alleles that were not detected using traditional VC pipelines. This approach is broadly applicable to other highly heterozygous outbreeding species. Finally, we used all this information to create a comprehensive catalogue of functionally annotated genetic variation across many pathways that control growth, development and agricultural traits.2. Materials and methods2.1 Candidate gene identification and manual curationGene families of A. thaliana candidate genes were identified using the comparative genomics platform PLAZA 3.0 Monocots.20,Brachypodium distachyon family members were used to identify homologous loci in the draft genome sequence of L. perenne12 using BLASTx analysis (E-value 10e-5). At each L. perenne locus, predicted protein sequences were added to the corresponding PLAZA 3.0 Monocots gene family. Using protein sequences of all gene family members of A. thaliana, B. distachyon and L. perenne, a phylogenetic tree was built with MUSCLE (v3.8.31)21 and PhyML22 using default settings, and for each A. thaliana candidate gene the closest orthologous L. perenne gene was selected for further manual curation. The L. perenne gene models were evaluated using multiple protein sequence alignments with MUSCLE using orthologous proteins from B. distachyon, O. sativa, Z. mays and S. bicolor according to PLAZA 3.0 Monocots. Additional RNA-seq data23–25 mapped with TopHat (v2.0.13)26 using default settings, was used to refine gene models and delineate untranslated regions, or to design a new gene model if required (Supplementary Data S1).2.2 Probe design, library construction and sequencingThe coding strand of each of the 503 target regions (gene model and 1,000 bp upstream promoter region) was tiled with 120 bp probes, starting every 40 bp using OligoTiler.27 Probes showing high sequence similarity to non-targets, other probes, repetitive sequences, mitochondrial or chloroplast sequences, or with extreme GC content (<25% or >65%) were removed. Finally, 57,693 SureSelect probes of 120 bp (Agilent) were retained, covering 2.3 Mb of the intended 2.8 Mb target region, at around 3× tiling.Genomic DNA was extracted from freeze-dried leaf material from 736 L. perenne genotypes representing current cultivars, breeding material and wild accessions using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method.28 DNA concentration was measured using the Quantus double-stranded DNA assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For each genotype, an indexed shotgun sequencing library was prepared from 100 ng DNA by (i) Adaptive Focused Acoustic fragmentation on a Covaris S2 instrument (Covaris, Inc.), (ii) adapter ligation and (iii) magnetic bead purification using an adapted protocol of Uitdewilligen et al.29 The libraries were pooled without normalization into eight pools, each containing 96 libraries of individual genotypes. Each pool was used for a probe capture hybridization reaction according to the SureSelect protocol (Agilent SureSelectXT2 Target Enrichment for Illumina Paired-End Sequencing Library Protocol, v. 1.0). After PCR amplification of purified enriched pooled libraries, each pool of 96 libraries was sequenced on one lane of a HiSeq2000 instrument using 2 × 91 PE sequencing (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The raw data is available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject PRJNA434356, Accessions SRR6812717–SRR6813075).2.3 Read mapping and variant callingRaw reads were trimmed and quality filtered by Trimmomatic (v0.32)30 and mapped onto the draft perennial ryegrass genome sequence12 with default settings of BWA-MEM (version 0.7.8-r455)31 and GSNAP (version 2016-09-23).32 Duplicate reads were marked using Picard-tools (release 1.113). Local realignment around indels was performed according to the best practices workflow of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (v.3.7).36,37 RD and coverage were calculated on the resulting BAM files using BEDTools (v2.25.0).33Four different VC pipelines were used: SAMtools (version 1.2-115-gb8ff342),34 Freebayes (v1.0.2-2-g7ceb532),35 GATK Unified Genotyper (GATK UG) and GATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK HC).36,37 Multi-allelic variants were removed using VCFtools (v0.1.14).38 For hard filtering, a custom Python script was used to remove variant positions and genotype calls with a RD lower than 6 and a genotype quality (GQ) lower than 30. SNPs and indels were automatically integrated by the VMC (v1.0),39 in 10 and 2 partitions, respectively. The estimated precision (EP) was calculated using a custom Python script based on the formulas given in Gézsi et al.39 The concordance of SNP and indel sets identified by four VC pipelines was determined using information in the INFO field of the VCF file returned by VMC and visually represented using Upset,40 before and after precision-based filtering (EP > 80%). Functional effects of sequence variants were predicted with SnpEff (version 4.3T).41 To validate consistency of genotype calls in an F1 segregating population, Mendelian inheritance errors (MIE) were defined after precision-based filtering (EP > 80%) using PLINK (v1.90b2t), for two parents and their F1 progeny of 29 individuals. Variants with a missing genotype call in either one of the parents were excluded from analysis, as were MIEs derived from a missing genotype call in one of the 29 F1 progeny.2.4 Hi-Plex amplicon sequencingTo generate an independent variant set, 78 genotypes were selected for resequencing of 171 amplicon regions of 80–140 bp. Of these, 147 amplicons overlap with 28 candidate genes. Primers were designed with Primer342 and divided into two highly multiplex (Hi-Plex) PCR-reactions according to their amplification efficiency (Supplementary Data S4). DNA was extracted using the CTAB method28 and DNA concentration was measured using the Quantus double-stranded DNA assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Per sample, the final DNA concentration was adjusted to 40 ng/µl and the amplicons were PCR-amplified while adding sample specific indices. Libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep PCR-free Kit according to manufacturer directions (Kapa Biosystems, USA). Hi-Plex amplification reactions and library preparations were done by Floodlight Genomics LLC (Knoxville, TN, USA). The libraries were sequenced with 2 × 150 PE on a HiSeq3000 instrument (OMRF, Oklahoma City, OK, USA). Paired-end reads were merged with PEAR (v0.9.8)43 and adapter sequences were removed. The read data is available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject PRJNA437219, Accessions SRR6813540–SRR6813585). BWA-MEM was used for read mapping, and VC was done by running the four VC pipelines. Bi-allelic variants were extracted using VCFtools and combined by VMC and the EP was calculated as described above.2.5 Identification of divergent alleles of LpSDUF247Per genotype, all reads were used for De Bruijn Graph assembly without scaffolding (CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5.3, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com (date last accessed 14 september 2018)). Contigs of at least 200 bp were retained and mapped onto the reference genome with BWA-MEM using default parameters, to group all contigs of the 736 genotypes per candidate gene. Per candidate gene, sequences of overlapping allelic fragments were extracted from the BAM files using BEDtools and clustered with the OLC assembler CAP3 (version date 02/10/15).44 Singlet sequences returned by CAP3 were removed from further analysis. All resulting alleles are assigned to their respective candidate gene and are available as (Supplementary Data S5), allowing the reader to repeat the analyses described below for any other candidate gene.One of the candidate genes of the 503 gene set, LpSDUF247, is known to be highly polymorphic and was selected to demonstrate in-depth reconstruction of divergent alleles. The 34 contigs of LpSDUF247 were aligned using MUSCLE and six highly similar sequences (>98% identity) were removed. The reference gene model of LpSDUF247 was projected onto the contigs using GenomeThreader (v 1.6.6)45 to identify CDS regions (Supplementary Data S6) and corresponding protein sequences (Supplementary Data S7).All B. distachyon members of the DUF247 gene family (HOM03M000101) were used in a tBLASTn search against the perennial ryegrass genome sequence, and 25 LpDUF247 genes were identified and manually annotated (Supplementary Data S8). After multiple sequence alignment of all 25 LpDUF247 protein sequences with B. distachyon and H. vulgare gene family members using MUSCLE, a phylogenetic tree was built with PhyML using 100 rounds of bootstrapping (Supplementary Fig. S5). Similarly, a phylogenetic tree was built using the reference protein sequences of LpDUF247-01, LpSDUF247, LpDUF247-03 and LpDUF247-04, the protein sequences of the LpSDUF247 alleles, and five LpSDUF247-02 alleles identified by Manzanares et al.46 (Supplementary Fig. S6).The 28 novel alleles were added to the reference genome sequence and read mapping was repeated for all 736 genotypes onto this multi-allelic reference genome. A matrix was created with the average RD per LpSDUF247 allele per genotype using BEDtools. This matrix was normalized per genotype, by dividing the RD per LpSDUF247 allele by the sum of RDs across all LpSDUF247 alleles, to identify alleles with the highest relative RD for each genotype while correcting for differences in library size and capture efficiency across the set of 736 samples.3. Results and discussion3.1 Identification, classification and curation of target genesTo identify L. perenne genes putatively involved in the regulation of plant growth and development, plant architecture, induction of flowering, cell wall biogenesis and phytohormone biosynthesis, signalling and response, we first searched the literature for Arabidopsis thaliana genes with a well-defined molecular and physiological function (Supplementary Table S1). Next, the corresponding 174 gene families were identified with the comparative genomics platform PLAZA 3.0 Monocots.20 For each of the A. thaliana candidate genes, a comprehensive list of orthologous loci in the draft genome sequence of L. perenne12 was delineated. A phylogenetic tree was built for A. thaliana and B. distachyon gene family members of the 174 PLAZA gene families, to select the closest orthologous L. perenne sequences of the candidate genes. When no clear one-to-one orthologous pairs were found due to lineage-specific gene duplication or gene loss events, the best two or three L. perenne loci were selected from the respective clades. The final selection contained 503 L. perenne candidate genes (Supplementary Table S1). For 407 of these loci, an annotated gene model was available.12 For the other 96 loci, a gene model needed to be annotated ab initio, in line with previous observations that the annotated gene space of L. perenne is 76% complete.47 The available gene models were evaluated using multiple protein sequence alignments with all their monocot gene family members according to PLAZA 3.0 Monocots. In addition, mapped RNA-seq data23–25 was used to refine gene models and delineate untranslated regions. Taken together, manual curation of 503 gene models (Supplementary Data S1), showed that previously available gene models12 were correct for 272 loci (54%) and needed small adaptations for 135 loci (27%). A completely new gene model was annotated at 96 loci (19%) using RNA-seq data. The length of the protein sequences corresponds well to that of their closest B. distachyon orthologs (Supplementary Fig. S1), showing that the 503 manually curated L. perenne gene models are of high quality (HQ). This was required to delineate regions for probe design and to correctly position variants relative to the reading frame in the CDS to functionally interpret the consequences of sequence polymorphism in the genic regions. Finally, the 503 candidate genes were assigned to biological processes based on the known function of their A. thaliana orthologs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). This HQ gene set can also be used to train and validate gene prediction algorithms to improve genome-wide gene annotation. Assignment of 503 candidate genes to pathways and distribution of high impact mutations per pathwayAssignment of 503 candidate genes to pathways and distribution of high impact mutations per pathway3.2 Design and efficacy of targeted resequencing by probe capture enrichmentFor each candidate gene, a target region was delineated spanning the curated gene model and an additional 1,000 bp upstream promoter region, as described previously.48 Probes were designed for a total length of 2.3 Mbp, corresponding to a coverage of 85% of each target region on average, as probes targeting repetitive regions were excluded (Supplementary Data S2). Targeted resequencing of 736 genotypes resulted in 3.2 million reads per genotype on average (range 20 thousand–31 million). After duplicate read removal, a mean of 1.9 million reads was retained per genotype, corresponding to a mean RD of 80× per position within the target regions. For VC analysis in heterozygous diploid species, a coverage of at least 6–10× is desirable to avoid false negative heterozygous calls.49 Saturation curves show a non-linear relationship between number of reads per library and target region coverage at a given RD threshold, as expected for probe capture enriched shotgun sequencing libraries (Fig. 1). At least 550,000 uniquely mapped reads per genotype were required to reach the probe region coverage plateau at 95% for RD = 1. Further increasing the number of reads per sample did not substantially increase probe region coverage (see Ruttink et al.48). The probe region coverage was slightly lower at higher RD thresholds (89% for RD = 6 and 85% for RD = 10 (boxplots in Fig. 1). Target region coverage per genotype. For each of the 503 candidate genes, the target region was delineated as the gene model and an additional 1,000 bp upstream promoter region. The mean fraction of the target region covered per genotype is shown in function of the number of uniquely mapped reads using BWA-MEM after duplicate removal, using different RD thresholds [RD = 1 (blue), RD = 6 (green) and RD = 10 (orange)].Target region coverage per genotype.

Read mapping algorithm BWA-MEM31 was compared to GSNAP,32 which is able to handle short and long insertions and deletions. Two alignment based VC pipelines were selected for their strength in SNP calling50: GATK Unified Genotyper (GATK UG)36,37 and SAMtools.34 Additionally, two haplotype-based VC pipelines were chosen for their strength in indel detection: GATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK HC) and Freebayes.35 We compared the resulting variant sets and assessed the performance of hard filtering to improve the precision of variant sets. Finally, the four individual variant sets and corresponding variant quality annotations were merged by the VMC,39 allowing for precision-based filtering as an alternative to hard filtering.3.4 Influence of read mapping algorithms and variant calling pipelinesFor each VC pipeline, the similarity of SNP and indel sets identified using BWA-MEM or GSNAP mappings was calculated using the Jaccard Index (Fig. 2). The similarity of SNPBWA and SNPGSNAP sets was lowest for Freebayes (0.73) and highest for SAMtools (0.83). The similarity of indelBWA and indelGSNAP sets was lower than that of SNPBWA and SNPGSNAP, independent of the VC pipeline. Jaccard index between indelBWA and indelGSNAP sets ranged from 0.47 (Freebayes) to 0.70 (GATK HC). On average, 11% of the SNPs were uniquely identified in the SNPBWA set and 9% of the SNPs were uniquely identified in the SNPGSNAP set. Likewise, on average, 17% of the indels were uniquely identified in the indelBWA set and 19% of the indels were uniquely identified in the indelGSNAP set. In summary, the choice of read mapper did not affect the SNP and indel sets as much as the choice of VC pipeline. For results presented below, only variants identified on BWA-MEM mappings are shown, as the same trend was observed for GSNAP mappings. Overlap of variant sets generated using BWA-MEM and GSNAP mappings as input for four VC pipelines. SNPs and indels were determined for 503 candidate genes in 736 genotypes for BWA-MEM and GSNAP mappings using four VC pipelines. The intersect of variants sets was calculated to determine common variants (dark grey) and uniquely identified variants using BWA-MEM mappings (light grey) or GSNAP mappings (black) as input. The Jaccard index value indicates the corresponding similarity.Overlap of variant sets generated using BWA-MEM and GSNAP mappings as input for four VC pipelines.

The number of SNPs was highest for GATK UG and SAMtools and considerably lower for Freebayes. The number of indels was at least four times lower than the number of SNPs identified by the same VC pipeline. GATK UG and GATK HC identified the highest number of indels, and SAMtools the least. The concordance of all four VC pipelines was low: only 150k SNPs (33% of the total number of SNPs identified) and 6.8k indels (5% of the total number of indels identified) were commonly identified, in line with previous reports.14Size and concordance of bi-allelic SNP and indel sets of four VC pipelines, before and after precision-based filtering. SNPs and indels were identified for 503 candidate genes in 736 genotypes using four VC pipelines and concordance was calculated for bi-allelic SNPs (a) and indels (b). Per Upset plot, the lower left panel shows the total number of variants per VC pipeline; the lower right panel shows the overlap in call sets between the four VC pipelines.

The bar graph shows the size per concordance group before (black) and after integration by VMC and precision-based filtering (EP > 80%) (light grey).3.6 Precision-based filtering is more reliable than hard filteringHard filtering on e.g. minimal RD and GQ is a commonly used strategy to improve the precision of variant sets. As expected, both number of variant positions and call rate (number of genotype calls per position across 736 genotypes) decreased by filtering on minimal RD of six and minimal GQ score of 30 (Fig. 4a and b). Notably, hard filtering did not increase the concordance between VC pipelines (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that true variants were not necessarily identified by multiple VC pipelines. These results corroborate that it is difficult to build a reliable catalogue of sequence variation using a single VC pipeline and applying hard filtering.51Effect of hard filtering and precision-based filtering on the saturation of genotype calls across the 736 genotypes. SNPs and indels were determined for 503 candidate genes in 736 genotypes using four VC pipelines and integrated using the VMC. The genotype call rate was calculated as the number of genotype calls present for each variant, over the total number of genotypes, and plotted cumulatively to estimate the genotype call saturation. This was done for bi-allelic variant sets: (a) before and (b) after hard filtering (RD > 6, GQ > 30) of the variant sets returned by the four VC pipelines and (c) before and (d) after precision-based filtering (EP > 80%) of the VMC output.Effect of hard filtering and precision-based filtering on the saturation of genotype calls across the 736 genotypes.

The unfiltered, VMC integrated probe capture variant set contained 444,222 SNPs and 132,766 indels, determined in 736 genotypes and 503 candidate genes. By ordering the variants according to their probability, an EP was calculated for each variant, which can be used for precision-based filtering. In general, variants identified by multiple VC pipelines were assigned higher EP scores. As precision in this context refers to the number of true called variants, choosing an EP threshold is equivalent to finding a dataset- and aim-specific balance between sensitivity and precision of VC.393.7 Empirical determination of the EP thresholdInstead of using an arbitrary EP threshold, we reasoned that the EP threshold should be determined empirically, based on the distributions of EP values of HQ and low quality variants (LQ). In the absence of a published reference set of variants for the genotypes and genes used in this study, we generated an independent variant set for a subset of 78 genotypes using a Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing assay52 of 171 amplicons, of which 147 overlap with 28 out of the 503 candidate genes. Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing resulted in 126,000 reads per genotype on average (range 11,000–418,000), corresponding to an average RD of 619 reads per amplicon (range 24–20,000).Using the four VC pipelines integrated by the VMC resulted in a Hi-Plex variant set containing 813 SNPs and 184 indels, compared with 775 SNPs and 246 indels in the probe capture variant set that overlap with these amplicons. In total, 593 SNPs and 60 indels were commonly identified by the two independent sequencing-based genotyping methods. Together, these variants were defined as the HQ subset of variants. Conversely, SNPs and indels that were unique to either set (i.e. non-reproducible and more likely to be random artefacts), were defined as the LQ subset of variants per genotyping method.To further validate HQ variants, we compared genotype calls of two methods (probe capture vs Hi-Plex) at the individual genotype level. The mean genotype call consistency, calculated as percentage of identical genotype calls on the total of 593 HQ SNPs and 60 HQ indels, over all 78 genotypes was 97% (range 93–100%). This high level of genotype call consistency confirmed the HQ of commonly identified variants. Inconsistent genotype calls are most likely the result of failed probe capture, low RD, the complexity of the region potentially hampering read mapping, allele specific amplification bias in the amplicon sequencing data, or combinations thereof.Comparison of EP value distributions of HQ and LQ variant positions (Fig. 5) revealed that EP values of the Hi-Plex variant set were generally lower than those of the probe capture variant set, possibly because of higher RD and lower complexity of amplicon reads. Furthermore, EP values associated with HQ SNPs were higher than EP values of LQ SNPs for both Hi-Plex and probe capture SNP sets. Taken together, these data show that an EP threshold of 80% differentiates most HQ variants from LQ variants in the probe capture SNP set, whereas the EP threshold needs to be set at 70% to remove LQ variants from the Hi-Plex SNP set. This further indicates that different EP thresholds ought to be used depending on the genotyping method. In contrast to SNPs, there was no clear differentiation between EP values associated with HQ or LQ indels (Fig. 5). This shows that indel detection remains challenging because of mapping and/or realignment errors, and errors near repetitive regions,53 thus leading to an incomplete indel set and underestimation of frameshift variants. Distribution of EP values in HQ and LQ variant sets. For variants present in 78 genotypes and 147 amplicons, box plots show the distributions of EP values for commonly identified (HQ) and uniquely identified variants (LQ) in the probe capture and Hi-Plex variant sets.Distribution of EP values in HQ and LQ variant sets. For variants present in 78 genotypes and 147 amplicons, box plots show the distributions of EP values for commonly identified (HQ) and uniquely identified variants (LQ) in the probe capture and Hi-Plex variant sets.Using the empirically validated EP threshold of 80% for the probe capture variant set containing variants of 736 genotypes and 503 candidate genes resulted in 252,406 SNPs and 5,074 indels (Supplementary Data S3). The high genotype call consistency indicates that the VMC, at least for SNPs, was able to reliably integrate variant sets without losing genotype call quality. Moreover, using the VMC for precision-based filtering led to a higher genotype call rate compared with hard filtering of individual VC pipelines (Fig. 4c and d).3.8 Validation of the resulting variant set in an F1 progenyMendelian inheritance in a segregating F1 progeny derived from a bi-parental cross was used as an accuracy measurement for the precision-based filtered variant set: MIEs are most likely the result of erroneous genotype calls. The set of 736 individuals contained 2 parents and their respective F1 progeny of 29 individuals. The genotype calls of these individuals were used to calculate the number of MIEs. Out of the 257,480 variants, 10,669 contained a missing genotype call in either one or both parents (4%) and could not be tested. For the 246,881 remaining variants and 29 individuals, 89,789 MIEs were identified, of which 57,326 (63%) were due to a missing genotype call. The other 32,463 MIEs represent a genotype call error in only a fraction of all genotype calls among the 246,881 variants in this F1 progeny (<0.5%). Moreover, these MIEs corresponded to 9,440 variant positions (4%) of which most had a MIE in a single individual (Supplementary Fig. S3).3.9 Effects of sequence variation on gene functionWe investigated the consequences of sequence variants on predicted gene function, using the manually curated HQ gene models to annotate the variants with SnpEff.41 The complete annotation of functional effects for each of 252,406 SNPs and 5,074 indels is available as Supplementary Data S3. Out of the 257,480 variants, 65,225 resided in exon regions (25%) and 116,274 in intron regions (45%) corresponding to a density of 8.6 and 10.1 variants per 100 bp, respectively. Among the SNPs in coding regions, 38% were non-synonymous substitutions, which is consistent with previous observations in L. perenne transcriptomes.23–25A general overview of the abundance of high impact effects on gene function, listed per functional category or pathway is presented in Table 1. These include gain of stop codons, frame shifts and alterations in splice sites, as they are most likely to disrupt protein function, possibly leading to loss of function (LOF), and causing phenotypic variation. For instance, the variant set contained 256 stop gain variants, affecting 144 out of the 503 candidate genes. The position of each stop gain relative to the total CDS length could indicate the degree to which the protein is affected (Supplementary Fig. S4). Most of these stop gain variants occur at low allele frequency across the germplasm collection. Additionally, 72 candidate genes were affected by splice site variants: 40 variants affected donor splice sites and 47 variants affected acceptor splice sites. In line with the relatively low number of indels (5,074), only 20 frameshift variants were identified in 19 genes. In summary, naturally occurring LOF alleles could be readily identified in as much as one-third of the genes tested across various pathways that are important for plant growth and development.This variant catalogue can be exploited in a dual fashion: (1) to associate genomic variation with phenotypic variation using an association mapping approach, which we are currently performing for architectural traits and cell wall digestibility, or (2) to mine for rare defective alleles, i.e. variants that disrupt gene function or regulation, and to subsequently select carriers of these variants for detailed phenotypic analysis. For example, we observed naturally occurring alleles for the single copy genes GIGANTEA (LpGI-01) and ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABSCISIC ACID 1 (LpERA1-01), in which a premature stop codon truncates translation at 5% and 23% of the protein length, respectively. Crosses with the carriers of these putative null alleles could help to clarify the function of LpGI-01 in the regulation of flowering time, circadian clock, and/or hypocotyl elongation54 and LpERA1-01 in meristem organization and the ABA-mediated signal transduction pathway.55Sequence variants were determined in a germplasm collection representing commercial cultivars, breeding populations and wild accessions, so as to ensure the downstream application in current breeding programs. For instance, the 170 amplicons used to estimate the EP threshold, and to validate the genotype calls of the probe capture set, were designed to cover the genetic diversity in 28 genes putatively involved in flowering time and other phenotypic traits of interest to breeders. Design and validation of these amplicons is a clear illustration of the application of the variant set. Since a comprehensive set of SNPs and indels are now known for our breeding materials, detailed and customised design of PCR primers targeting specific SNPs in candidate genes spread across the genome, while avoiding polymorphisms in the flanking primer binding site, becomes feasible. Similar methods and criteria apply to the design of hybridization probes for high density SNP arrays. We are currently using Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing as a very cost- and time-efficient method to screen hundreds of variants simultaneously in a few thousand genotypes, a scale required to screen for putative associations with phenotypic traits in our current breeding populations.3.10 Reconstruction of divergent alleles enables better characterization of genetic variationThe prime goal of targeted resequencing is to de novo discover alleles that are divergent from the reference genome sequence. However, the capture efficiency of a divergent sequence is reduced with increasing sequence dissimilarity to the reference sequence for which the probes were designed. Additionally, reads may fail to map to highly divergent regions if the parameters for short read alignment are too stringent.18 To circumvent mapping short reads to a single reference sequence, on which classical VC pipelines rely, we devised a de novo assembly strategy to reconstruct full-length alleles. First, de novo assembly of the captured reads was performed per individual genotype to reconstruct alleles for each of the 503 candidate genes in parallel. Next, all de novo assembled contigs from all 736 genotypes were aligned to the reference genome to sort out and extract all corresponding allelic fragments per candidate gene. Per gene, all contigs were clustered using the OLC assembler CAP344 to collapse allelic redundancy and resolve fragmented gene sequences. This three-step approach results in a collection of alternative alleles assigned to each of the 503 candidate genes (on average 58 contigs per gene, range 4–203). The entire set of 29,320 CAP3 contigs is available as Supplementary Data S5. The value of this approach is that we can now characterize genetic variation in regions of high sequence diversity where traditional short read mapping-based VC pipelines fail.We demonstrate the value of this approach for LpSDUF247, but all analyses described below may be repeated for any of the other 502 candidate genes, using the sequence data supplied as Supplementary Data S5. LpSDUF247 is a highly polymorphic gene co-segregating with the S-locus that determines the grass self-incompatibility system.46 CAP3 clustered the allelic diversity present in the 736 genotypes into 34 separate contigs. Alignment of CAP3 contigs identified a central region of the protein with high sequence divergence, while this region is virtually free from SNPs in the VC dataset, showing the limitations of read mapping-based VC. Six contigs displayed high sequence similarity (98%) to the reference sequence or to other contigs and were removed. Within the remaining allelic contigs, a single exon encoded for the DUF247 protein. The translated proteins showed only 73–84% global sequence identity with each other (Fig. 6a). These data are consistent with the previously reported identification of at least five unique alleles of LpSDUF247 with 80–90% protein sequence identity.46 Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that de novo assembled contigs were indeed novel alleles of LpSDUF247 at the S-locus, and not of any of the 24 other DUF247 paralogs in the L. perenne genome (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). Sequence diversity and distribution of 28 newly identified alleles of LpSDUF247 across breeding populations and wild accessions. A similarity matrix (a) and phylogenetic tree (b) were built using the protein sequences of 28 alleles and reference sequence (R) of LpSDUF247, together with three additional DUF247 genes. Panel c gives an overview of the distribution of the LpSDUF247 alleles across the gene pool. The alleles present per genotype were identified by mapping the reads to a multi-allelic reference genome, and calculating the ratio of average RD per allele over the total number of reads mapping to LpSDUF247 alleles.Sequence diversity and distribution of 28 newly identified alleles of LpSDUF247 across breeding populations and wild accessions.

The alleles present per genotype were identified by mapping the reads to a multi-allelic reference genome, and calculating the ratio of average RD per allele over the total number of reads mapping to LpSDUF247 alleles.Next, we analysed the distribution of LpSDUF247 alleles across the L. perenne germplasm collection. The 28 novel alleles were added to the reference genome sequence, thus complementing the reference LpSDUF247 allele, and giving reads the opportunity for near-perfect mapping at their respective allele. Differential read mapping across the alleles in a multi-allelic context was then used to score which alleles are present in each genotype. Mapping reads in a multi-allelic context eliminates the need for VC, but only if alleles are sufficiently divergent so that differential RD can be used to identify which alleles are present per genotype. Near-perfect mapping of the raw reads onto the newly constructed LpSDUF247 alternative alleles confirmed their existence in the L. perenne germplasm collection, except for allele 31 which had no read support (Fig. 6c). This also shows that the capture efficiency of 120 bp probes was sufficient to detect alleles with as little as 80% sequence identity to the reference genome sequence.In the vast majority of genotypes (501 out of 736) the reads almost exclusively mapped onto a combination of two LpSDUF247 alleles, often at similar RD, and only a minor fraction (<5%) of reads mapped to additional alleles (Fig. 6c). There was no bias for combinations of alleles across wild accessions, breeding populations and cultivars, and clear segregation of alleles was observed in the F1 progeny (n = 29) of a bi-parental cross that was included in the set of 736 individuals (Supplementary Fig. S7). Furthermore, 57 genotypes displayed reads mapping only to a single allele, suggesting either homozygosity or the failure to capture and sequence yet undiscovered alternative alleles with even stronger sequence divergence to the reference genome sequence used to design the probes. Finally, 177 genotypes displayed RD spread over three or more alternative alleles. In 65 of them, the higher allele count could be explained by a consistent co-segregation of LpSDUF247-04 with LpSDUF247-28 suggesting a gene duplication, in combination with an additional, variable third allele. In the remaining 112 genotypes, the observation that reads map to more than two alleles in a multi-allelic reference genome, could indicate ambiguity of read mapping between closely related alleles, or the presence of additional alleles derived from cross-over events at the LpSDUF247 locus.Although LpSDUF247 was the most extreme case of sequence divergence in alternative alleles, Supplementary Figure S8 presents four other candidate genes with different levels of divergence, global or local. The alternative alleles of LpMAX3-01 and LpETR1-01 showed only local sequence divergence, at the introns and 5'UTR regions, respectively. The sequence variation of LpFT-04 was captured in only four contigs, explaining why the variant density across the gene region was low, especially when low frequent SNPs were filtered out. Taken together, the analysis of LpSDUF247 demonstrates the rich sequence diversity that can be mined for in this catalogue of genomic diversity across 503 candidate genes.We thank the breeders of ILVO, Barenbrug and Eurograss for providing plant material, András Gézsi for support and advice for running the VMC and Kurt Lamour (Floodlight Genomics) for his services provided for the Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing assay.

IntroductionHigh-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and associated bioinformatics are transforming the study of evolutionary and comparative genetics, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize and understand diversity and function in both model and non-model organisms.1–3 In this context, one recent revolution is the use of HTS technologies to analyse sets of RNA molecules, transcriptomes, on a massively parallel scale.4,5 The transcriptome is a snapshot in time of genes transcribed in the tissue or cells sampled. Investigation of transcriptomes can allow the identification of functional elements of genomes, reveal molecular constituents of cells and tissues, help understand organismal development and disease,6 and has the potential to uncover the role of tissue-specific evolution in biological diversity.7 Having entered the phylogenomics era, RNA-seq has also become a powerful complement of de novo genome sequencing, particularly helping with functional annotation8 and gene expression assessment, and is sometimes the only practical approach to scan and survey gene diversity in organisms with large genomes that still lack reference genomic data.9 A general strategy for this approach is to pool the mRNA data from a wide range of tissues (from different individuals and/or stages of development) to assemble a reference dataset of the genes of the species (i.e. a proxy of the reference genome of the species).We have applied the pooling of tissue-specific reads from RNA-seq to the study of tissue-specific transcriptomic landscapes of five species of caecilian amphibians (order Gymnophiona) representing four of the ten currently recognized families (Caeciliidae, Rhinatrematidae, Siphonopidae and Typhlonectidae) and a range of ecologies and degrees of evolutionary divergence (including coverage of both branches of the basal evolutionary divergence within the order).10 Caecilians are, along with frogs and salamanders, one of the three orders of extant amphibians. They are a highly specialized group with elongate, annulated, limbless bodies, reduced visual systems and with paired bilateral sensory tentacles on the snout.11 There are 207 currently recognized extant species classified in 32 genera, with mainly tropical distributions and mainly burrowing habits.12–14 Most are terrestrial as adults, living in soil, but several species of the Typhlonectidae (including the one sampled here) are fully aquatic. Caecilians are an old group, with at least 250 million years (myr) of separate evolution from their sister-group, the frogs and salamanders.15–19 Due to their specialized body form, ecological distinctiveness and phylogenetic position in the vertebrate tree of life, caecilians are interesting for macro-evolutionary, life history and evolutionary developmental biology research.11We provide a first large-scale characterization of caecilian genomes using multi-tissue transcriptomic landscapes generated with RNA-seq. We use two complementary approaches to investigate features of caecilian protein-coding sequences in a vertebrate comparative framework. First, we assess the degree to which homologous elements of caecilian functional genes of varying tissue specificity can be identified across 51 other vertebrates. This reveals a high number of unclassified candidate gene families that are transcribed differentially across tissue types in caecilians. Comparisons between the already known vertebrate gene families and the potentially novel gene families found in caecilians highlight the relevance of skin-specific genes and the poor characterization of the molecular elements of caecilian skin. Here, we start addressing this knowledge gap by identifying protein domains for the caecilian skin-specific genes. Second, we infer the phylogenetic relationships of the five sampled caecilian species and the same set of 51 vertebrates based on candidate orthologous genes. This study provides new information about the functional elements of the genome and phylogenomics of caecilians and highlights distinctive and singular genes for the most neglected amphibian order.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample preparation and high-throughput sequencingThis study includes novel data from five caecilian species: Rhinatrema bivittatum (Guérrin-Méneville, 1838), Caecilia tentaculata Linnaeus, 1758, Typhlonectes compressicauda (Duméril & Bibron, 1841), Microcaecilia unicolor (Duméril, 1861) and Microcaecilia dermatophaga Wilkinson, Sherratt, Starace & Gower, 2013. Different tissues (skin, posterior skin [from the posterior end of the body], foregut, muscle, liver, kidney, lung, heart, spleen and testis) were collected from freshly sacrificed, captive (but wild caught, in French Guiana) maintained specimens anesthetized with tricaine methanesulphonate (MS222). Biopsy samples were cut into pieces thinner than 0.25 cm in any single dimension, immediately soaked in RNAlater stabilization solution (Qiagen), incubated at 4°C overnight (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue) and stored at -20°C. Numbers of specimens and of tissues sampled per species, voucher and sampling information are given in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1. Information on the species-specific caecilian transcriptome assemblies and their annotationN: number of specimens; T: number of tissues; % CEGs: percentage completeness core eukaryotic genes; veNOG annotation: number of genes with similarity match in veNOG database; KVGF annotation: number of known vertebrate gene families with caecilian genes.Information on the species-specific caecilian transcriptome assemblies and their annotationN: number of specimens; T: number of tissues; % CEGs: percentage completeness core eukaryotic genes; veNOG annotation: number of genes with similarity match in veNOG database; KVGF annotation: number of known vertebrate gene families with caecilian genes.RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer’s instructions, following tissue disruption and homogenization with TissueRuptor (Qiagen). RNA quantity and quality was assessed with Qubit 2.0 fluorometer, NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (RNA Nano Chip). Forty RNA extractions with RNA integrity number, RIN,20 values ranging from 7.8 to 10 were selected for RNA-seq. These 40 selected samples included RNA extractions of skin, liver and kidney for all five caecilian species, as well as a selection of other tissues (foregut, muscle, lung, heart, spleen, testis) each available for only a subset of the species (see Supplementary Table S1). Unstranded paired-end sequencing after poly-A enrichment and TruSeq library preparation was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform at Macrogen (16 RNA extraction samples) and BGI Tech Solutions (24 RNA extraction samples) using ten dual flow cells, two lanes per sample. All RNA extractions from the same tissue were sequenced by the same company.2.2. Raw data processing and de novo assemblyPaired-end RNA-seq raw reads (100 nucleotides long) of each of the 40 tissue samples were trimmed individually and filtered by PRINSEQ 0.20.321 after inspection of the FastQC 0.11.222 quality control report. In all cases, the first 15 bases from the 5' end of the reads, optical duplicates and reads with an average Phred quality score23 below 25 were removed. Separate de novo assemblies were performed for each of the five caecilian species employed in the study (species-specific transcriptome assemblies). These were carried out by pooling together all reads (filtered and trimmed) for tissue samples belonging to the same species (Supplementary Table S1). Reads were also pooled for all (both) specimens for each of the two species for which multiple specimens were sampled. A few preliminary de novo assembly runs of separate tissue samples (single-tissue transcriptome assemblies) were conducted on the TRUFA platform24 to explore parameter settings and run times.De novo species-specific assemblies were performed with Trinity r2014071725 using 60 Gb of RAM (–max_memory 60G) and prior in silico normalization (with otherwise default settings26). TransDecoder 2.026 was used with default settings to identify candidate protein-coding genes from the subsets of contigs with open reading frame (ORFs) in the five caecilian species-specific transcriptomes. Reads were mapped back to each assembly with Bowtie 2.0.2,27 post-processed with SAMtools28 and gene expression was estimated using the counts of reads mapping to each assembly with HTSeq 0.6.1.29 Multiple measures (N50, median contig length, average contig length, alignment percentage) were used for assessing the accuracy of each of the five caecilian species-specific assemblies.30,31 Likewise, we used a computational method, CEGMA 2.4,32 to estimate the percentage completeness of each caecilian transcriptome, and compared these with the completeness percentages of the genome assemblies of the frog Xenopus tropicalis Gray, 1864 v9.0 and v4.1.33 Finally, we compared our species-specific transcriptomes to other transcriptomes recently generated for four species of caecilians, including for two of our sampled species (R. bivittatum, T. compressicauda, T. natans [Fischer, 1880] and Geotrypetes seraphini [Duméril, 1859]).34 These previously published caecilian transcriptomes are not associated with tissue-expression information and they contain fewer ORFs than do our transcriptomes for the same species. Using similarity searches, we determined that the vast majority (89.83%) of the protein-coding genes from the previous transcriptomes occur also in our transcriptomes (using BLAST, blastp version 2.2.2835 with e-value threshold of 1e-20: data not shown). Thus, the previously published caecilian genomic data were not used in our subsequent analyses.2.3. Multigene family analysisContigs of the five new species-specific caecilian transcriptomes containing ORFs were aligned against predefined vertebrate-specific gene families (veNOGs) from the EggNOG 4.1 database36 using blastp, applying a conservative e-value threshold of 1e-20 (applying less conservative 1e-10 or 1e-5 cutoffs does not result in substantially greater annotation percentages: data not shown). Contigs with expression levels below 100 total read counts were discarded and not used in subsequent analyses. We classified all caecilian annotations (from the pooled contigs of the five species) according to the gene-expression presence across the tissues sampled. For tissue expression analysis, contigs were postulated as being expressed in a particular tissue of a particular transcriptome if they had a minimum of 10 reads aligning to them. This allowed a scale of ‘tissue presence’ to be generated, ranging from those genes found expressed in every tissue type to those found expressed in only one tissue type. The distribution of all homologues of the caecilian protein-coding genes on the vertebrate taxonomy tree from the NCBI taxonomy database was generated and visualized using phyloT and ITOL,37 respectively. Vertebrate taxonomy tree was built using the unique identifier, taxids, of the species that are included in the EggNOG database.Where possible, caecilian gene families were annotated with the same function as those vertebrate gene families with the best BLAST match (smallest e-value and highest BIT score) in EggNOG identified above. Transcripts with no hits to the known vertebrate gene families in EggNOG were clustered using CD-HIT 4.6.438 with a threshold of 90% amino acid sequence identity to ensure same function of the sequences clustered. These clusters were compared against protein-coding genes from currently available amphibian genomes (Ambystoma mexicanum [Shaw & Nodder, 1798], Nanorana parkeri [Stejneger, 1927], Rana catesbeiana Shaw 1802 and Xenopus laevis [Daudin, 1802])33,39–41 that are not included in the EggNOG database, using blastp, with an e-value threshold of 1e-20. Clusters that remained without similarity hits after the searches against the amphibian genomes were classified as potentially (candidate) novel caecilian gene families. Of these, we calculated the number of tissues in which any gene family was expressed (as described earlier). In addition, to characterize the different tissues with a more restrictive approach than the previously used tissue presence classification, tissue specificity was postulated when 95% of total read counts in each caecilian contig belonged to a single tissue for both unclassified and known vertebrate gene families. To test if there was a greater number of candidate novel genes specific to a particular tissue type than expected by chance, the relative abundance of known vertebrate gene families versus those of candidate novel caecilian gene families were compared using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test conducted with R 3.3.0,42 with the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the numbers of tissue-specific candidate novel genes. Finally, our characterization of tissue specificity expression was completed with the inference of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and functional enrichment pathways using STRING43 with the option of auto-detect organism for the known vertebrate gene families; and the Pfam44 annotation of the uncharacterized, candidate novel caecilian gene families using HMMER 3.045 with default parameters to identify protein domains.2.4. Orthology prediction and phylogenomic analysisTo carry out a phylogenomic analysis we identified candidate orthologous genes from across vertebrates, including our caecilian samples. To do this we used OrthoFinder 0.2.846 and used as input all predicted protein-coding genes from the caecilian transcriptomes and all protein-coding sequences for the 51 vertebrates represented in the EggNOG database. From the results of OrthoFinder analysis we filtered out any groups (orthogroups) that had more than one gene copy in one species (co-orthologues for different species and paralogues for the same species). Multiple-sequence alignments were performed individually for each of the resulting filtered orthogroups using MAFFT 7.24547 with default settings, and individual gene trees were inferred using approximately maximum-likelihood with FastTree 2.1.848 and the JTT+CAT model of amino acid substitutions.49 We reconstructed a supertree using ASTRAL 4.10.11, which provides statistically consistent species tree inference from gene trees subject to incomplete lineage sorting,50,51 and computed posterior probabilities and quartet support for the internal branches of the main recovered topology.3. Results and discussion3.1. De novo transcriptome assembliesIn total, RNA sequencing yielded nearly two billion reads (1,963,110,986), averaging 49 million reads per library. The five species-specific assemblies from pooled reads of all tissues of each species resulted in transcriptomes of a mean of 146,227 contigs with N50 values of 1,263–1,884 (Supplementary Table S2). Tissue-specific RNA-seq reads and species-specific de novo transcriptome assemblies are available from NCBI through BioProject ID number PRJNA387587. The maximum and minimum contig lengths were 27,126 and 201 (default minimum size parameter used in the assembly program) bases, respectively. The longest contig was reconstructed from the R. bivittatum transcriptome and only a few very long (see Supplementary Fig. S1) contigs were present in any of the species-specific caecilian transcriptomes. In addition to transcriptome metrics, we assessed the quality of the de novo assemblies by the extent to which each pair of raw reads (more than 95%) could be mapped to the same contig (Supplementary Table S2). On average, 27,600 protein-coding genes were identified from the contigs with ORFs, (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Our caecilian transcriptome reconstructions were supported also by the annotation. At least 241 of 248 ultra-conserved core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) occur in all five species-specific transcriptomes (Table 1). For the sake of comparison, we checked also the presence of CEGs in two different genome assemblies of X. tropicalis and found 225 CEGs in the most recent (v9.0) and 219 in an earlier version (v4.1).On the basis of the quality of our transcriptome assembly reconstructions, we obtained useful reference genomic records for caecilian amphibians, the first to our knowledge that are broad and diverse in terms of species and tissues sampled. Although the metrics used to assess the quality of assemblies of transcriptomic data are controversial30 our caecilian transcriptome sequences contain more CEGs than the two genome assemblies of X. tropicalis used for comparison, suggesting that our reference species-specific transcriptomes are fairly complete (Table 1). Even so, the generated reference transcriptomes are not fully complete, missing specific genes related to developmental stages and to tissues not sampled in our study. As with estimates for other vertebrates, the number of protein-coding genes identified in the species-specific caecilian transcriptomes is approximately 25,000 (Table 1), and a relatively high percentage of such proteins were annotated, which is also indicative of accurate transcriptome reconstruction. Gene identification is one of the major challenges of de novo transcriptome assembly, even for Trinity assembly of paired-end sequence data that enables potentially confounding sources of variation such as alternative splicing and paralogous genes to be overcome.25 Thus, the numbers of protein-coding genes could be overestimated. An additional problem is that the transcriptomes are not composed solely of transcripts from protein-coding genes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that almost the entire genome is transcribed.52 Accordingly, caecilian contigs that are not protein-coding genes or degradation products of the same, nor possible chimeras, are postulated to be long non-coding RNAs and potentially important regulatory elements.3.2. Vertebrate gene families and unclassified gene familiesThe vast majority of the annotated caecilian genes that are homologous with those vertebrate genes in the EggNOG database, are expressed in most of the (up to nine) sampled caecilian tissue types. This could be interpreted as indicative of constitutive expression and many might be housekeeping genes. Only a small proportion (see Fig. 1, one tissue fraction) of the caecilian genes with matches to EggNOG (and thus annotated) are tissue specific. This same pattern was found when comparing the pooled caecilian sample (all five species) with each of the 51 EggNOG database vertebrates, with no obvious phylogenetic pattern (Fig. 1). The number of caecilian contigs with matches to known vertebrate genes ranged from 17,099 to 19,863 per caecilian species (Table 1), representing 57.32–77.52% (mean 67.70%) of all caecilian protein-coding genes. We found that 38.75–52.91% (mean 46.36%) of the annotated caecilian genes were classified into vertebrate gene families from EggNOG. Numbers and tissue presence of the annotated genes found in caecilian transcriptomes. Genes were pooled for the five sampled species-specific transcriptomes and annotated in the 51 vertebrate species available on the EggNOG database, and mapped onto a vertebrate phylogeny inferred from the NCBI’s taxids (using phyloT and ITOL). For each vertebrate taxon, the number of caecilian annotated genes is subdivided to show the number of caecilian tissue types in which those genes are expressed.Numbers and tissue presence of the annotated genes found in caecilian transcriptomes.

For each vertebrate taxon, the number of caecilian annotated genes is subdivided to show the number of caecilian tissue types in which those genes are expressed.To investigate and quantify the importance of the uncharacterized genes in caecilians, we grouped these protein-coding sequences into multigene families and filtered them by excluding clusters with close similarity to genes from the available amphibian genomes. If caecilian genomes did not contain genes novel for vertebrates, it would be expected that the vast majority of their genes would belong to some already described, known vertebrate gene family or have homologous sequences in the reported amphibian genomes. However, our results indicate that less than half of the caecilian gene families belong to known vertebrate gene families. Given the sparse taxon sampling and the currently poor genomic reference record for amphibians, at least some of the unclassified gene families in caecilians could contain genes from other vertebrate taxa or be amphibian rather than caecilian specific. The absence of homologues of these caecilian gene families in other vertebrate species might reflect gene loss events53,54 or, alternatively, faster sequence evolution in some caecilian genes. Either way, caecilians likely have many functional elements that are novel for vertebrates.A total of 177 known vertebrate and 422 novel caecilian gene families exhibit tissue-specific expression (Table 2). A significantly greater number of novel caecilian genes were expressed only in skin (P-value = 4.5e-05, Fisher’s exact test). In contrast, caecilian spleen transcripts had significantly lower than expected tissue-specific novel gene families (P-value = 0.01935, Fisher’s exact test). Among the tissue-specific known vertebrate gene families, we found significantly more predicted protein–protein interactions (PPIs) than expected by chance and functional enrichment of metabolic pathways in five caecilian tissues (foregut, kidney, liver, spleen and testis, see Supplementary Table S3). The functional enrichments observed tend to relate to well-characterized processes in these tissues such as nutrient absorption in the foregut samples (GO: 0007586), organic acid, anion and amino acid transmembrane transport in the kidney samples (GO:1903825, GO:0098656, GO:0003333), and regulation of fibrinolysis in the liver (GO:0051918), (see Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, in skin samples we did not observe significantly more PPIs than expected by chance, or functional enrichment of pathways in the genes with known annotations. This may be because the vast majority (87%) of genes with tissue-specific gene expression in skin did not match any known vertebrate gene families, the highest of any of the tissues examined (Table 2). This analysis suggests that skin-specific vertebrate gene families remain poorly characterized in general and likely have unknown, innovative functions and interactions. Novel tissue-specific genes in caeciliansThe number of transcriptomes determined for each tissue, and the tissue-specific gene families (caecilian gene families that are already known vertebrate gene families, caecilian gene families shared with the other four sampled non-caecilian amphibians, and candidate caecilian-specific gene families) are shown. The last row shows the P-value (significant values in bold font) for Fisher’s exact test of the difference between the abundance of known vertebrate gene families and those of uncharacterized candidate novel caecilian gene families. Skin tissue includes skin samples from different parts of the body: skin and posterior skin samples, see Supplementary Table S1.Novel tissue-specific genes in caeciliansThe number of transcriptomes determined for each tissue, and the tissue-specific gene families (caecilian gene families that are already known vertebrate gene families, caecilian gene families shared with the other four sampled non-caecilian amphibians, and candidate caecilian-specific gene families) are shown.

Skin tissue includes skin samples from different parts of the body: skin and posterior skin samples, see Supplementary Table S1.3.3. Skin-specific genes of caeciliansPotentially novel caecilian gene families (those without hits to known genes) expressed in skin were annotated with protein domains that might be associated causally with specializations of caecilian skin.55,56 From the uncharacterized tissue-specific clusters (108 in the skin), a total of 91 different protein domains were identified (Supplementary Table S4), including 16 domains occurring exclusively in the skin in our analysis, such as diverse proteases, amino acid storage receptors and toxin-like domains. Skin forms the barrier between the organism and the environment both physically and biochemically. It is genetically and physiologically very active throughout an animal’s life. Amphibian skin is multifunctional with additional roles in respiration, water regulation, and in defence against predators and pathogens.57,58 The defensive properties of amphibian skin rely mainly on biochemical substances secreted from specialized skin granular glands.59 These secretions can contain numerous bioactive components, including alkaloids, biogenic amines, peptides and proteins,60 some of which have been isolated and studied, particularly in frogs and salamanders.61–63 The diversity of functions and biochemical activities of amphibian skin makes it unsurprising that caecilians present specific expression patterns of novel genes, particularly considering their 250+ myr of separate evolutionary history from the other major amphibian lineages15–19 and the sustained contact between the skin and soil for most caecilian species. Indeed, some of the protein domains found exclusively in caecilian skin-specific novel gene families, such as proteases and toxin-like domains (Asp_protease_2, gag-asp_proteas, Toxin_TOLIP, UPAR_LY6, see Supplementary Table S4) point to novel skin defensive mechanisms.The maternal skin of some caecilian species plays another unique role: in provision of nutrition to newborns (maternal dermatophagy).64,65 This behaviour occurs in several of the species sampled in this study (observed in M. dermatophaga, likely also present in M. unicolor and C. tentaculata).10 This phenomenon is especially interesting for understanding the evolution of viviparity because it is possibly a precursor of the oviduct feeding by fetuses that occurs in viviparous caecilians.62 Maternal dermatophagy involves structural and histochemical changes in the mothers’ epidermis, it becomes hypertrophied and heavily invested with energy reserves,64 and hence expanded gene machinery is likely needed. Amino acid storage receptor (PhaP_Bmeg, see Supplementary Table S4) is another protein domain found in skin-specific novel gene families that might be related to the unique parental care of caecilian amphibians. A final feature of caecilian skin that makes it so distinctive is the presence of scales.66 Scales are absent in other extant amphibians but are present, concealed in dermal pockets, in many caecilians (all except T. compressicauda of those sampled in our study). Some of the skin-specific gene families with domains of unknown function (DUF, see Supplementary Table S4) might be involved in the production and maintenance of scales.Further data and analyses are required to identify the taxonomic distribution, diversity and function of these candidate skin-specific gene families. Greater tissue sampling in the future may reveal similar patterns in other tissues, such as testis or gut, that present particularities in caecilians with respect to other amphibians that may be reflected in their genomes. For example, caecilians differ from other amphibians in that males have a copulatory organ formed from the eversible final part of the gut,67 as well as other autapomorphies of the sperm and internal fertilization specializations such as the Müllerian gland and the ejaculate.683.4. Phylogenomic datasetWe obtained a total of 23,761 groups or orthogroups, of which 1,955 were groups comprising genes with only one copy in at least four vertebrate taxa. The filtered orthogroups seemingly contain no paralogous genes, at least from the same species, and are straightforward for use in phylogenomics and the study of evolutionary processes that depend upon inferred phylogenetic relationships.69 The number of analysed genes found in each species is detailed in Supplementary Table S5. For each of the 1,955 orthogroups phylogenetic gene trees were inferred. A supertree was retrieved from the gene trees under a multi-species coalescent model, maximizing the number of induced quartet trees (the supertree is presented in Supplementary Fig. S2). The normalized quartet score of the main topology was 0.798 (i.e. 79.8% of the quartet trees displayed by our gene trees are displayed by the supertree). The supertree constructed from the gene trees of the candidate orthologous groups recovered the main known topology of this subset of the Tree of Life (Supplementary Fig. S2). Branches within the caecilian part of the supertree are well supported as judged by both posterior probabilities and quartet support values. Among the sampled vertebrates, Lissamphibia and Gymnophiona are recovered as monophyletic, and the inferred relationships among the five caecilian species are fully congruent with those inferred in other (non-phylogenomic and phylogenomic) molecular analyses.10,34 Our results indicate that combining the information from putative orthologous genes using supertree approach is adequate to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the sampled caecilians, and vertebrates in general.4. Concluding remarksAs with other studies that have characterized transcriptomes,9 this study has a strong descriptive component, but it has yielded novel discoveries and represents an important turning point for genomic studies in caecilians (and vertebrates), improving prospects for future research. The species-specific de novo transcriptomes of caecilian amphibians presented here could be improved by additional sequencing of different tissues, individuals and developmental stages (e.g. the transcriptome of M. dermatophaga was built from only four tissue-type samples). In terms of sampling and biological replicates, only the species-specific transcriptomes of R. bivittatum and M. unicolor were reconstructed using more than one (two) specimen each. Obtaining fresh biological samples has been a limiting step for research on many caecilian species,70 and dedicated fieldwork will likely be required to investigate broadly the genomic potential of this neglected, but important group of vertebrates.Genome science has irreversibly changed the landscape of biological research. Understanding life processes and their evolutionary changes by reading the complete set of encoded instructions that each species holds is increasingly becoming a reality. Nonetheless, achieving this goal thoroughly still remains a challenge for most groups of organisms. Of the almost 6,600 eukaryotic genomes available on the NCBI database, only six records are of amphibian species: A. mexicanum, N. parkeri, R. catesbeiana, Rhinella marina Linnaeus, 1758, X. laevis and X. tropicalis (21 September 2018, date last accessed). Despite the great effort made by initiatives such as the Genome 10 K Project71,72 and other genome-scale studies (e.g. Xenbase,33 Salamander Genome project73), amphibians are the major group of vertebrates with fewest genomic resources available, and, importantly, there are none for the order Gymnophiona.74 The lack of at least one representative organism of each of the three extant amphibian orders has compromised the diversity of comparable genomic resources for vertebrates, as well as the opportunities for evolutionary and phylogenomic research. To start filling this gap, here we have reported transcriptomic data for five caecilian amphibian species, including first genomic records for three species (C. tentaculata, M. unicolor and M. dermatophaga), and characterized several unclassified candidate gene families with tissue-specific expression, especially in the skin. This provides insights into the evolution of vertebrate protein-coding genes, and further establishes the basis for gene-discovery work as well as investigation of the molecular elements underlying the singular biology of caecilian amphibians.We thank Ainhoa Agorreta, Cristina Frías-López, Julio Rozas, Rafael Zardoya, Kim Roelants, Karen Siu-Ting, Jeff Streicher and Iván de la Hera for insightful comments, help, and advice on this project.

IntroductionCo-linearity among closely related genomes erodes over time due to the accumulation of mutations including gene duplication, deletion, and transposition.1 Gene duplication affects gene dosage, which may lead to divergence of expression and functions among duplicates.2,3 Gene transposition events modify expression strength and tissue-specificity through changes in regulatory sequences,4,5 local epigenetic environment,6 and proximity to enhancers and chromatin structural contexts.7–9 Such events have been associated with variation in copy numbers of genes and transcripts,5,10 as well as localization11 and functions12–14 of encoded proteins among orthologous genes. A large number of studies have reported examples of gene level duplications and transpositions as key underlying sources for adaptations to specific environments or speciation.15–21Comparative analysis of co-linearity and its erosion identifies modes of gene duplications22,23 and traces the origin of genes or gene families and their evolutionary history.24–26 Such comparative analyses are facilitated by de novo assembled genomes released at unprecedented rates today,27–30 enabling detection of gene gain and loss as well as duplication and transposition among closely related taxa. These resources also call for novel methods and tools for systematic comparative analysis of genomes.A number of tools are available for identification of gene blocks or large genomic regions co-linear among multiple genomes.31–33 Another set of tools can identify orthologues in related genomes for a gene of interest and visualize synteny and evolutionary events, such as gene duplication and transposition, associated with them.34–38 However, currently we do not have a method that can retrieve all orthologue loci within multiple genomes that have likely undergone the same set of evolutionary events without a prior assignment of a gene of interest.To address this, we introduce the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline, which identifies co-linearity (CL) in the gene order among multiple genomes, identify ‘orthologue groups’ based on co-linearity, and encodes genes in each orthologue group as a network of orthologues (OrthNet). Each orthologue group includes orthologues and paralogues likely derived from a single ancestral locus in multiple target genomes. All evolutionary events in each orthologue group, such as gene duplication, deletion, transposition, and any combination of them, in addition to gene synteny conservation, are captured as the topology of an OrthNet. Our pipeline enables detection of all orthologue groups from multiple genome that seemingly underwent the same evolutionary events, by searching OrthNets essentially based on their topologies.As a proof-of-concept, we applied the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline to six Brassicaceae (crucifer) genomes that share the same whole genome duplication history.39 The six Brassicaceae genomes included the model species Arabidopsis thaliana40 and extremophytes Schrenkiella parvula41 and Eutrema salsugineum,42,43 the two most salt-tolerant Brassicaceae species so far tested.44,S. parvula and E. salsugineum are biogeographicaly seperated and represent taxa adapted to multi-ion salt strsses in soils near a hypersaline lake in central Anatolia5 and combined salt and freezing stresses in salt pans of high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere,45,46 respectively. These two extremophytes provide optimal models for comparative analyses to study plant adaptations to environmental challenges.47,48The CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline detects any combination of gene synteny conservation, duplications, deletions, and transpositions. For this study, we focused on the relatively under-studied transposition–duplication (tr–d) events within the six Brassicaceae genomes. A tr–d is an event where a single non-transposon gene is duplicated and relocated to a position where all evidence of common ancestry (i.e. synteny) is lost, i.e. ‘Duplication mode IV’ as defined by Freeling.22 A tr–d event results in variations in both copy numbers and co-linearity and, unlike other types of gene duplications, requires a systematic comparison of multiple genomes for detection.22,49 Our pipeline identified tr–d events unique to a genome or shared by any subset of the six Brassicaceae genomes, as well as the original donor and duplicate loci in each tr–d event including loci with truncated coding regions. Using this pipeline, we aim to identify the landscape of lineage-specific and shared tr–d events among the target genomes; test whether there is a signature of selective retention among lineage-specific tr–d events; and characterize tr–d events unique to the extremophyte genomes, which may have contributed to their adaptive evolution.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome and gene modelsWe obtained genome annotations of Arabidopsis lyrata (Aly, version 1.0), A. thaliana (Ath, v. ‘TAIR10’), Capsella rubella (Cru, v. 1.0), and E. salsugineum (Esa, v. 1.0) from Phytozome v. 11 (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), while genomes of Sisymbrium irio (Sir, v. 0.2; CoGE genome id 19579) and S. parvula (v. 2.0) were downloaded from CoGE (https://genomevolution.org/coge/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)) and thellungiella.org (http://thellungiella.org/data/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), respectively. For S. irio annotation, we used a combination of RepeatMasker, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Nucleotides (BLASTN)50 search vs Repbase v. 20170127 (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), and OrthoMCL51 to further filter out gene models most likely unannotated transposable elements (TEs). This step was added to remove the large number of repetitive lineage-specific genes (34.9% of 49,956 gene models), many of them showing sequence similarities with known TEs, in the S. irio genome annotation. To generate a species tree of Brassicaceae genomes including the six target species (Fig. 1), we used Agalma52 which built a maximum likelihood tree based on 14,614 alignments of homologous protein-coding gene clusters. Each cluster contained sequences from more than four crucifer genomes. We listed in Supplementary Table S1 additional genome resources used for the Brassicaceae species tree.

Boxes and stars indicate the six Brassicaceae species selected for this work and halophytes, respectively. The tree was based on an alignment of 14,614 homologous gene clusters, as described in Materials and Methods.For the analysis of co-linearity erosion (Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1), we compared all protein-coding gene loci in five crucifer genomes to those in A. thaliana using BLASTN. Four degenerate site (4d) substitution rate distributions were analysed for all reciprocal BLASTN pairs of protein-coding genes between the five crucifer genomes and A. thaliana, using codeml53 and custom scripts. TE contents were determined using RepeatMasker v. 4.0.7 and RepeatModeler v. 1.0.8 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), for all six target species.2.2. Detecting co-linearity in gene orders among Brassicaceae genomesWe developed the CLfinder process to scan the order of homologous gene loci between a pair of genomes and detect co-linearity among them. The CLfinder module performs this process automatically for all pairs among multiple closely related genomes. The CLfinder uses three inputs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2), for which we used only primary transcript models for protein-coding gene loci. Input 1: A custom script (‘parse_gtf.py’) parsed genome annotation in Genomic Transfer Format (GTF). Input 2: Intra-species paralogous loci detected by clustering primary protein-coding gene model sequences within each species using OrthoMCL,51 as previously described in ref. 5. Input 3: Results of pairwise reciprocal BLASTN (e < 10-5) between all primary protein-coding gene model ORFs to obtain the ten most similar BLASTN hits (‘best-hits’) in the target species, for each gene model in the query species. The CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline consists of two modules, CLfinder (Co-Linearity finder) and ONfinder (OrthNet finder). In the cartoon next to the box for the CLfinder module, blue squares indicate gene loci with disrupted co-linearity due to mutations and indels in neighbouring loci, while orange squares are those transposed and lost the synteny. See Supplementary Fig. S1 for details. Next to the box for the ONfinder module is an exemplary OrthNet. (A) For the detailed method to determine co-linearity (CL) relationship between the query loci and their most homologous counterpart (‘best-hits’) in the target genome, see Materials and Methods (2.2) and Figs S2 and S3.

(B) See Figures 3–6, for examples of OrthNets with different evolutionary histories represented as different network topologies, e.g. transposition (tr) and transposition–duplication (tr–d) unique to each species or a group of species.The sensitivity and stringency of the CLfinder process are adjustable based on three user-defined parameters, the window size (W), the number of co-linear loci-in-chain threshold (N), and the maximum gap allowed between co-linear loci-in chain (G) (Supplementary Fig. S2). For each query locus (from Input 1), CLfinder scans and counts the number of ‘loci-in-chain’, whose best-hits (from Input 3) are separated by the same or less than G from the best-hit of their immediate neighbours. The scan starts from the query locus and moves towards both up- and downstream of the query genome. If more than N loci-in-chain, including the query locus, are found within a window size of 2 × W (i.e. W to the up- and downstream), the query locus is declared co-linear (cl) with its best-hit locus in the target species. When loci-in-chain were found only towards one direction, the query-target best-hit pair is considered to represent an end of a co-linear genome segment derived from inversions, indels, and segmental duplications involving multiple gene loci, and designated as ‘cl_end’. We excluded lineage-specific (ls) loci that did not have a best-hit in the target species from the search for co-linear loci-in-chain. Tandem duplicated (td) loci, defined as adjacent loci separated by the same or less than T loci (Supplementary Fig. S2) and in the same paralogue cluster defined in Input 2, were counted as a single locus during the co-linearity search step. A query locus neither co-linear (cl) nor lineage-specific (ls) was considered to be transposed (tr). If the query locus is in a genome assembly scaffold that contains less than W loci, the pipeline will mark the query locus as not-determined (nd) instead of transposed (tr). Segmental rearrangements such as local inversion are identified based on loci-in-chain detected exclusively in either up- or down-stream. In such cases, CLfinder declares the query and its best-hit as cl_end.For the analysis of six crucifer genomes, CLfinder parameters (W = 20, N = 3, G = 20, and T = 4) were decided based on the distribution of protein-coding gene locus content in the scaffolds of the most fragmented genome and the results from the analysis of co-linearity erosion. The window size (W) was chosen based on the most fragmented S. irio genome, where >63% of total genes were in scaffolds that contained at least 20 gene loci. Maximum gap between co-linear loci-in-chain (G = 20) was decided to distinguish gene order displacements likely caused by local indels from those by transpositions, based on the result of co-linearity erosion analysis (Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1). With W and N parameters set, we tested multiple number of co-linear loci-in-chain threshold (N) parameters to detect co-linear genes between simulated genomes of 27,000 gene loci, assuming a complete random shuffling and lack of a common ancestor between genomes. With N = 3, after 10,000 simulations comparing randomly shuffled simulated genomes, CLfinder found on average only 39.43 ± 9.85 genes (0.15 ± 0.04% of the simulated genome) as false-positive co-linear genes, indicating that the selected parameters can effectively rule out co-linearity by chance and without a common ancestry (Supplementary Table S2). We determined the maximum tandem duplication distance (T = 4) to enable detection of nested tandem duplication events while filtering out tandem duplications with too many unrelated genes inserted in between. The CLfinder process (Supplementary Fig. S3) was performed for all possible query-target pairs for the six crucifer species using a wrapper script in the CLfinder module (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘CLfinder_multi.py’). The results are combined into a single table and given as Supplementary Dataset S1.2.3. Construction of OrthNets for Brassicaceae genomesThe second module of the pipeline, ONfinder (OrthNet finder), combines the output of the CLfinder module and produces networks of orthologous loci (OrthNet). OrthNets represent primary protein-coding gene loci from all species (nodes) connected with their best-hits with directional edges, and the co-linearity relationship (i.e. either cl, tr, or nd) between them as the edge property. In addition, OrthNets include tandem duplicated paralogues connected with undirected edges (td) among themselves. The ONfinder module also compares the ORF size of a node to the median ORF size of all neighbouring nodes to detect truncated ORFs (i.e. of sizes less than 40 and 80% of the median ORF size) in each OrthNet.ONfinder first clusters all nodes from all species connected with an edge (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘create_OrthNet.py’). This process often results in an aggregation of multiple loci connected with unidirectional edges in a single large OrthNet, due to duplicated paralogues, lineage-specific deletions, and partial gene models that lead to non-reciprocal best-hit pairs. We employed two methods to alleviate this issue. First, for all unidirectional edges from node A to node B, ONfinder searches for an alternative best-hit for B, among the list of the ten best-hit candidates, that makes A and B a reciprocal best-hit pair (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘update_BestHitPairs.py’). The best-hit candidates were obtained by running BLASTN with the ‘-max_target_seqs 10’ option when creating the Input 2 for the CLfinder module. The ONfinder module records how many best-hit candidates it tested before identifying a reciprocal best-hit pair (Supplmentary Dataset S1, legend). Only when a reciprocal best-hit does not exist among all ten alternatives, the OrthNet will have a unidirectional edge. Second, each OrthNet is subjected to further clustering to finer OrthNets using Markov Chain Clustering (MCL),54 with an inflation parameter (1.2) and a higher edge weight given in the order of td (1.5), reciprocal cl (1.2), unidirectional cl (0.6), reciprocal tr (0.5), and unidirectional tr (0.25) edges (default edge weight values used in this study are in parentheses). Edge weights for the MCL process were decided as detailed in Supplementary Text S2 and Fig. S4, with the following aims: (i) to separate networks of out-paralogues derived from multiple loci duplicated prior to the divergence of the six target genomes (as exemplified in Supplementary Fig. S4), while (ii) keeping paralogues that underwent tandem duplication (td), transposition–duplication (tr–d), and combinations of td and tr–d, together with the core set of co-linear orthologues in the same OrthNet. Once an OrthNet was separated into multiple smaller OrthNets, any edge removed by MCL was replaced by an alternative edge connecting nodes within each of new OrthNets, by searching for an alternative best-hit pair among the list of ten best-hit candidates (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The ONfinder module records the number of best-hit candidates tested before the final edge was decided (Supplementary Dataset S1). The MCL process effectively removed spurious unidirectional edges that connect nodes from different loci (Supplementary Fig. S2. ‘update_OrthNet_afterMCL.py’, see also Supplementary Text S2 and Fig. S4 for detailed discussion and an example). The final network units (OrthNets) were converted to the Simple Interaction File (SIF) format for visualization using Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)). All OrthNets derived from this analysis are included as archived SIFs (Supplementary Dataset S2).2.4. Searching OrthNets that share an evolutionary historyWhile CLfinder and ONfinder can operate independently, when used in a pipeline, the ONfinder module adds the results of its analysis to the CLfinder result for each locus (Supplementary Dataset S1). For each gene locus that belonged to an OrthNet, ONfinder adds the unique ID of the OrthNet that includes the locus, number of nodes derived from each genome (i.e. gene copy numbers) in the OrthNet, and the edge types connecting the locus to its best-hit nodes in other genomes (Supplementary Dataset S1). This information enabled identifying OrthNets with the same or similar topologies that represent the same set of evolutionary events.The ONfinder module offers two methods to search OrthNets (Supplementary Fig. S2). To systematically identify OrthNets including tr–d events uniquely found in subsets of the six crucifer genomes, we searched for OrthNets that (i) showed a node copy number pattern consistent with duplications specific to the subset and (ii) contain nodes that are connected to all of their orthologous neighbours through unidirectional tr edges. We used the ‘search_OrthNet_pattern.py’ script (Supplementary Fig. S2) and searched for node copy number and edge property patterns as listed in Supplementary Table S3, in the CLfinder-OrthNet output (Supplementary Dataset S1). For evolutionary history patterns presented in Fig. 3A, the second script, ‘search_OrthNet_topology.py’ (Supplementary Fig. S2), found all OrthNets with either exactly the same or similar topologies with the query OrthNet. The ONfinder module encodes the evolutionary history of an orthologous gene group into an OrthNet. (A) OrthNet examples representing five different evolutionary histories of orthologous gene groups derived from the six Brassicaceae genomes (Fig. 1, highlighted with boxes).

Analysis of transposition–duplication (tr–d) eventsWithin an OrthNet with a tr–d event, the tr–d donor or ‘CL copy’ was the node connected to orthologous nodes with the most cl edges, while the remaining were tr–d acceptors or ‘Tr copies’. When multiple CL copies existed due to tandem duplication, we used the one with the longest ORF as the representing CL copy. Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) were detected between the gene and ±5 kb intergenic regions of the CL copy and each of Tr copies, using LASTZ with chaining as previously described in ref. 5. A tr–d event was ‘complete’ if the HGS included the entire CL copy gene. A ‘gene-only’ tr–d was defined as a complete tr–d event with the size of HGS less than 120% of the coding region of the CL copy gene. We determined the expected occurrences of complete and gene-only tr–d by random shuffling and overlapping of HGSs and CL copy genes. Specifically, we assumed a random HGS selected among the observed HGS length distribution occurred at a random position in the vicinity of a CL copy gene, with a minimum 60 bps overlap between the genic region and a HGS. The distribution of such occurrences from 10,000 iterations was fitted to a normal distribution to calculate the P-value of the observed occurrence, using the fitdistr function in R MASS package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS (10 October 2018, date last accessed)).The four degenerate site (4d) substitution rates were calculated for all CL and Tr copy pairs where the Tr copy contained a complete ORF, using codeml53 and a custom script (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘pairwiseKs_by_codeml.py’). All custom scripts used in this study are available at the CLfinder-OrthNet GitHub page (https://github.com/ohdongha/CL_finder). To determine Tr copies with expression evidence, we used RNA-seq data for leaf and root tissues obtained from Wang et al.13 for A. lyrata, A. thaliana, and C. rubella, and Oh et al.5 for A. thaliana and S. parvula as well as samples prepared for this study (for E. salsugineum, BioProject ID PRJNA63667) as previously described in Oh et al.5 FPKM values of representative transcript models were estimated using Stringtie (v. 1.3.1c) with the ‘-e’ option,55 after RNAseq reads were aligned to the genome using HISAT2 (v. 2.0.5).553. Results3.1. Patterns of co-linearity erosion within the six Brassicaceae genomesWe selected a set of six genomes with the same whole genome duplication history sampled from the Brassicaceae Lineages I and II for this study (Fig. 1). This set includes the model plant A. thaliana (Ath) and its relatives in Lineage I, A. lyrata (Aly) and Capsella rubella (Cru), as well as Sisymbrium irio (Sir) and the two extremophytes, E. salsugineum (Esa) and S. parvula (Spa), in Lineage II. Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic relationships of the target species with other published genomes in Brassicaceae based on amino acid sequence alignments of 14,614 homolog clusters (see Materials and Methods, 2.1).Before applying the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline, we analysed the degree of co-linearity erosion among the target Brassicaceae genomes by comparing gene orders, as detailed in Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1. Our analysis revealed that two-thirds of genes identified as non-transposable element (non-TE) and non-lineage-specific (non-LS) genes in the Brassicaceae genomes showed a conservation of gene order with their immediate neighbours when compared with the genome of A. thaliana (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1 =1). The proportion of non-TE and non-LS gene loci showing a proximal (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1 = 2–20) and distal (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1 >20 and ‘Diff Chr’) gene order displacement, compared with their immediate neighbours, was correlated with the divergence time between genomes and their TE contents, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This suggested two different models for co-linearity erosion, as summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1E. The proximal gene order displacements were likely resulted from mutations and indels accumulated in the neighbouring loci over time (Supplementary Fig. S1A, blue loci). In this model, larger gene order displacements requiring multiple mutations in the neighbouring gene loci are rarer, which explains the rapid decline of genes in Supplementary Fig. S1B as dn,n+1 increases from 1, i.e. perfect co-linearity, to larger values (Supplementary Fig. S1E, blue line and arrow). The second model involves transposition of mostly single locus (Supplementary Fig. S1A, orange loci), which may have been initiated by the presence of repetitive sequences and TE activities. Transposition based on mechanisms such as the repair of double strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining (DSB-NHEJ)1 can occur ubiquitously between any pair of genomic locations with a frequency lower than that of point mutations (Supplementary Fig. S1E, orange line and arrow). Genes showing larger dn,n+1 with their neighbours in both directions are most likely transposed via the second model. We used the result from co-linearity erosion (Supplementary Fig. S1B) to determine parameters suitable for detecting co-linear loci between a pair of genomes, as detailed in Materials and Methods (2.2) and Supplementary Text S1.3.2. Development of the CLfinder-OrthNet pipelineOur pipeline consists of two modules: CLfinder and ONfinder (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The first module, CLfinder, compares all possible pairs of query and target genomes and test whether each homologous gene pair (i.e. ‘best-hit’ pair, Supplementary Text Glossary) is co-linear (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3, and Dataset S1). CLfinder accepts three inputs: representative gene models for all loci in each genome, clusters of paralogues within each genome, and lists of best-hits between all possible query-target genome pairs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Users can select the methods and criteria for defining paralogue clusters and best-hit pairs, as well as the sensitivity and stringency for the co-linearity detection by controlling three parameters: the window size (W), the number of co-linear loci-in-chain threshold (N), and the maximum gap allowed between co-linear loci-in chain (G) (see Materials and Methods, 2.2). Based on these parameters, the CLfinder module searches both up- and downstream of each locus in the query genome for ‘loci-in-chain’ based on the order of their best-hits in the target genome, to determine whether a query-target best-hit pair is either co-linear (cl), transposed (tr), or not able to determine (nd) due to the query genome assembly scaffold being too short. When co-linearity was detected only towards one direction, the query-target best-hit pair is considered representing an end of a co-linear genome segment (cl_end) derived from inversions, indels, and segmental duplications involving multiple gene loci. A query locus without a best-hit in the target genome is marked lineage-specific (ls) (Supplementary Fig. S3).The second module, ONfinder, combines all pairwise comparisons by CLfinder and encodes co-linearity relationships among orthologues into networks (OrthNets), with gene loci as nodes connected by an edge to their best-hits in other genomes (Figs 2 and 3). Each edge has a property of either co-linear (cl), transposed (tr), or not determined (nd). The cl and tr edges can be either reciprocal or unidirectional (Fig. 3A, ‘rc’ and ‘uni’, respectively). OrthNets also include tandem duplicated (td) paralogues, connected by undirected edges [e.g. panel (4) in Fig. 3A]. ONfinder uses Markov clustering (MCL),54 based on edge weights assigned according to edge properties, to divide large networks that are often a result of expanded gene families with a large number of paralogues into smaller clusters likely derived from a single ancestral locus (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Text S2). Each cluster of orthologues, separated by MCL, is given an OrthNet ID and represented as an orthologue network or an OrthNet. Finally, ONfinder can search with a user-defined pattern of orthologue copy numbers, edge characteristics, and network topology, to retrieve all OrthNets sharing a given set of evolutionary events (see Materials and Methods, 2.4). Several selected examples of OrthNets representing different evolutionary histories are shown in Fig. 3A.3.3. Identification of OrthNets among six Brassicaceae genomesWe tested the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline on the six Brassicaceae genomes using parameters and input files as described in Materials and Methods. The CLfinder module summarizes all reciprocal query-target genome pairwise analyses as exemplified for the six Brassicaceae genomes in Table 1. For simplicity, we considered cl_end loci pairs as cl in this summary. All query-target genome pairs showed a comparable number of cl loci pairs, ranging from 19,015 (Table 1, Sir–Aly) to 24,296 (Table 1, Aly–Ath). The number of cl pairs follows the division of the Lineage I (Table 1, Aly, Ath, and Cru) and II (Table 1, Esa, Sir, and Spa), with higher numbers observed between query-target pairs within each Lineage. The number of tr loci pairs was proportional to the repeat contents of the query genomes. For example, A. lyrata and E. salsugineum are the query genomes with the highest content of tr pairs (Table 1, Aly and Esa), which correlated with the higher content of repeats in these two genomes than in A. thaliana, C. rubella, or S. parvula genomes [‘TE(%)’ row in Supplementary Table S4]. When S. irio was the query, the proportion of nd pairs was higher than all other genomes (Table 1, Sir), because it had the most fragmented genome assembly among the six genomes. The entire CLfinder results for all query-target genome pairs are in Supplementary Dataset S1. Summary of CLfinder results showing pairwise comparisons among 6 crucifer speciesCo-linear (cl), transposed (tr), lineage-specific (ls), or not determined due to too small genome scaffold (nd), with CLfinder parameters {window_size, num_CL_trshld, gap_CL_trshld} = { 20, 3, 20 }.Tandem duplication (td) detected using the parameter max_TD_loci_dist = 4.Summary of CLfinder results showing pairwise comparisons among 6 crucifer speciesCo-linear (cl), transposed (tr), lineage-specific (ls), or not determined due to too small genome scaffold (nd), with CLfinder parameters {window_size, num_CL_trshld, gap_CL_trshld} = { 20, 3, 20 }.Tandem duplication (td) detected using the parameter max_TD_loci_dist = 4.The ONfinder module combined all pairwise CLfinder analyses and developed OrthNets representing the evolutionary history of each set of orthologous loci as the network topology (Fig. 3). For an analysis of N genomes, a perfect polygon (e.g. hexagon in this study) with each of N nodes connected to other nodes by N-1 bidirectional solid grey edges represents a single-copy co-linear orthologous gene in all genomes [Fig. 3A, panel (1)]. We identified a total of 7,034 OrthNets that showed single-copy loci co-linear to each other in all genomes. Panel (2) of Fig. 3A is an example from 50 OrthNets with co-linearity found within each of the Lineages I and II while loci between the two Lineages were transposed, representing a transposition event following the lineage divergence. Panel (3) shows one of the nine OrthNets with only the locus in S. parvula transposed compared with all other species. We found 44 OrthNets with the same evolutionary history depicted in panel (4), i.e. E. salsugineum-specific tandem duplication, and 86 OrthNets for S. parvula-specific transposition–duplication (tr–d) events shown in panel (5) of Fig. 3A. ONfinder also compares the ORF size of a node with the median ORF size of all other orthologous nodes to which the node is connected, to identify truncated ORFs [e.g. panels (3), (4), and (5) in Fig. 3A]. We included all OrthNets together with the CLfinder results identified among the six Brassicaceae genomes in Supplementary Dataset S1.An OrthNet may include a disproportionately large number of duplicated gene loci in specific genomes. For example, an OrthNet showing A. lyrata-specific tr–d events included 82 nodes representing additional A. lyrata transposed–duplicated paralogue copies (Supplementary Fig. S5). Such duplication events, as well as large gene families where exact reciprocal orthologue pairs were hard to identify among multiple paralogues, may result in an OrthNet with a large number of nodes. However, more than 85% of OrthNets contain the same or less than 12 nodes per OrthNet (14,849 out of total 17,432 OrthNets), likely derived from single ancestral loci with duplications restricted in a subset of the six Brassicaceae genomes (Fig. 3B). The size distribution of OrthNets was also comparable with that of orthologous gene clusters detected based on sequence homology by OrthoFinder56 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The majority of OrthNets was matched 1-vs-1 with an OrthoFinder cluster (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In all OrthNet-OrthoFinder cluster pairs, 70.1% total OrthNets contained the set of genes identical to, and additional 12.3% OrthNets showed more than 80% overlap with, their corresponding OrthoFinder clusters (Supplementary Fig. S6C, dashed box). An example of OrthNet different from the orthologous gene cluster detected by OrthoFinder is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 and Text S2, respectively.3.4. Characterization of lineage-specific and shared tr–d events among Brassicaceae genomesWe used the ‘search_OrthNet_pattern.py’ script in the ONfinder (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3) to detect OrthNets representing tr and tr–d events either unique to each of the six Brassicaceae genomes or shared by more than one genome (Figs 4 and 5 and Supplementary Dataset S3). The number of OrthNets that showed tr events was smaller than those with tr–d events for all subsets of genomes including lineage-specific events (Supplementary Table S4). This observation agrees with the postulation that a tr event is a result of a deletion of the original/donor copy after a tr–d event.1Characterization of lineage-specific transposition–duplication (tr–d) events among the six Brassicaceae genomes. (A) Examples of OrthNets with tr–d events specific for S. parvula (WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 72/WRKY72) and C. rubella (AGAMOUS-LIKE 87/AGL87).

(A) Example OrthNets with tr–d events shared by E. salsugineum and S. parvula, representing two categories: (i) independent-parallel (‘Ind-parallel’) tr–d events and (ii) tr–d events with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Nodes and edges are as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Number of OrthNets shared by pairs of genomes in ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ categories, with the cladogram of the six crucifer genomes on the top. Heatmap colours visualize the rank of each cell based on the number of OrthNets in each category. (C) Proportion of Tr copies with complete ORFs (i.e. ORF size ±20% of the CL copy in proportion) within OrthNets presented in (B). The genome 1 (row)-genome 2 (column) position shows the number of Tr copies with complete ORF/total Tr copies in the genome 1, found in all OrthNets with tr–d shared by genomes 1 and 2. For example, the Aly–Ath and Ath–Aly positions in ‘Ind-parallel’ category indicate 6 out of 29 A. lyrata (Aly) Tr copies and 6 out of 22 A. thaliana (Ath) Tr copies, respectively, have complete ORFs in the 17 OrthNets with ‘Ind-parallel’ tr–d events shared by A. lyrata and A. thaliana.

(A) Example OrthNets with tr–d events shared by E. salsugineum and S. parvula, representing two categories: (i) independent-parallel (‘Ind-parallel’) tr–d events and (ii) tr–d events with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Nodes and edges are as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Number of OrthNets shared by pairs of genomes in ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ categories, with the cladogram of the six crucifer genomes on the top. Heatmap colours visualize the rank of each cell based on the number of OrthNets in each category. (C) Proportion of Tr copies with complete ORFs (i.e. ORF size ±20% of the CL copy in proportion) within OrthNets presented in (B). The genome 1 (row)-genome 2 (column) position shows the number of Tr copies with complete ORF/total Tr copies in the genome 1, found in all OrthNets with tr–d shared by genomes 1 and 2. For example, the Aly–Ath and Ath–Aly positions in ‘Ind-parallel’ category indicate 6 out of 29 A. lyrata (Aly) Tr copies and 6 out of 22 A. thaliana (Ath) Tr copies, respectively, have complete ORFs in the 17 OrthNets with ‘Ind-parallel’ tr–d events shared by A. lyrata and A. thaliana. Heatmap colours indicate the percentage of Tr copies with complete ORFs, for cells with >5 total Tr copies.In OrthNets including tr–d events, we identified the original donor or co-linear (CL) copy, or copies if the donor locus included tandem duplications, and the acceptor or transposed (Tr) copies, based on properties of edges connecting each of the duplicated paralogues to its neighbouring nodes in other genomes (Figs 4A and 5A). Figure 4A represents OrthNets with S. parvula and C. rubella lineage-specific tr–d events for orthologues of the WRKY72 and AGL87, respectively. The CL copy (Fig. 4A, ‘CL copy’) was a part of the hexagon and mostly reciprocally co-linear to its orthologue nodes (Fig. 4A, ‘Orthologs’) from other genomes. A Tr copy was connected to orthologue nodes in the hexagon through unidirectional tr edges (Fig. 4A, ‘Tr copies’). An OrthNet may contain a single lineage-specific tr–d event as in the OrthNet for WRKY72 (Fig. 4A, left) or multiple events featuring one CL copy associated with multiple Tr copies. Also, Tr copies may further undergo tandem duplication as shown in the OrthNet for AGL87 (Fig. 4A, right).We compared the ORF sizes between CL and Tr copies with the median ORF size of the orthologues from other genomes in the hexagon for all OrthNets representing lineage-specific tr–d events. We observed a conservation of ORF sizes between most CL copies and their co-linear orthologues (Fig. 4B, blue/filled dots), while the majority of Tr copies had truncated ORFs (Fig. 4B, grey dots). We also found a small proportion of Tr copies which had ORFs that were of similar size to their respective CL copy (Fig. 4C and D, pink shades). The distribution of the ORF size ratio between Tr and the CL copy showed peaks at 80–120% (Fig. 4D, pink shades). These Tr copies that showed conservation in maintaining the original size of the ORFs were more abundant in A. thaliana, C. rubella, E. salsugineum, and S. parvula. These contributed to more than 24% of all Tr copies found in lineage-specific tr–d events in these genomes (Fig. 4D).For tr–d events shared between any pair within the six genomes, we identified two categories with different evolutionary contexts: (i) parallel tr–d events independently occuring in two genomes (Fig. 5, ‘Ind-parallel’) and (ii) tr–d events where Tr copies from two genomes showing co-linearity between them (Fig. 5, ‘Tr–cl’). Figure 5A depicts examples of OrthNets including tr–d events in the two categories. We found a total of seven and six OrthNets with tr–d events in ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ categories, respectively, shared between E. salsugineum and S. parvula. Genomes with higher TE and repetitive sequence contents, such as A. lyrata, S. irio, and, to a lesser extent, E. salsugineum, included more ‘ind-parallel’ tr–d events shared with other genomes (Fig. 5B, left panel). Among Tr copies in ‘ind-parallel’ tr–d events, the proportion of complete ORFs (i.e. ORF size within ±20% of the ORF of the corresponding CL copy) were comparable with Tr copies in LS tr–d events (Fig. 5C, left panel and Fig. 4D).The ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d events were mostly found between pairs of more recently diverged genomes, e.g. A. lyrata–A. thaliana and S. irio–S. parvula. The number of ‘Tr–cl’ tr–d events detected between Lineages I and II genomes were very low (Fig. 5B, right panel). This observation was consistent with the notion that such a rare event must involve a tr–d event before the divergence of the two Lineages followed by deletions in all species except for the two genomes compared. The proportion of Tr copies that retained complete ORFs compared with the CL copy in ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d events was higher (=50%) than that found for ‘ind-parallel’ type tr–d events (Fig. 5C).3.5. Tr copies with complete ORFs were rare, but significantly more frequent than random chanceWe hypothesized that selection has favoured conservation of beneficial Tr copies to preserve the ORF in additional gene copies (Fig. 4C and D, pink shades; Fig. 5C), while majority of the Tr copies was either originally duplicated incompletely or have undergone mutations over time that had led to truncated ORFs. An alternative hypothesis is that these Tr copies with complete ORFs may have been easier to duplicate in their complete form by random chance due to their smaller gene size. Indeed, genes associated with Tr copies with complete ORFs were significantly shorter than those with Tr copies that had truncated ORFs (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7). Characterization of duplicated genomic regions in transposition–duplication (tr–d) events. (A) We identified Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) between the CL and Tr copy genes and adjacent genomic regions (±5 kb) in a tr–d event as described in Materials and Methods (2.5). A tr–d event is either complete or incomplete, based on whether the HGS included the full CL copy gene or not. A subset of complete tr–d events had HGS coinciding with the start and end of the CL copy gene without extending to the intergenic regions (‘gene-only’ tr–d). (B) Histograms and box-and-whisker plots (inlets) showing size distributions of HGSs and CL copy genes for complete and incomplete tr–d events. (C) Comparison of observed (Obs.) and expected (Exp.) occurrences of complete and gene-only tr–d events. Upper panel shows the distribution of expected occurrences from 10,000 random shuffling of HGSs and CL copy genes for A. lyrata (Aly)-specific complete and gene-only tr–d events. Fitting the random shuffling results to normal distributions (upper panel, blue curves) generated P-values of observed occurrences for tr–d events unique to each genome and the genus Arabidopsis (lower panel). (D) Four degenerate site (4d) substitution rates between ORFs of CL and Tr copy genes in different types of complete tr–d events. Complete tr–d events were either gene-only (‘go’) or with HGSs detected in both gene and intergenic regions (‘g+i’). We compared lineage-specific (LS) and shared tr–d events that are either independent-parallel (‘Ind-par’) or with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Lines and ‘x’ marks in the box indicate medians and means, respectively. (E) Proportion of Tr copy genes with expression evidences (RNA-seq FPKM>0) in all tr–d events either lineage-specific or shared by a pair of genomes. The tr–d type is as described in (A) and Tr copy ORF type is as in Fig. 4C and D (pink shade) and Fig. 6C. S. irio genes were excluded due to the lack of RNA-seq data.Characterization of duplicated genomic regions in transposition–duplication (tr–d) events. (A) We identified Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) between the CL and Tr copy genes and adjacent genomic regions (±5 kb) in a tr–d event as described in Materials and Methods (2.5).

Upper panel shows the distribution of expected occurrences from 10,000 random shuffling of HGSs and CL copy genes for A. lyrata (Aly)-specific complete and gene-only tr–d events. Fitting the random shuffling results to normal distributions (upper panel, blue curves) generated P-values of observed occurrences for tr–d events unique to each genome and the genus Arabidopsis (lower panel). (D) Four degenerate site (4d) substitution rates between ORFs of CL and Tr copy genes in different types of complete tr–d events. Complete tr–d events were either gene-only (‘go’) or with HGSs detected in both gene and intergenic regions (‘g+i’). We compared lineage-specific (LS) and shared tr–d events that are either independent-parallel (‘Ind-par’) or with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Lines and ‘x’ marks in the box indicate medians and means, respectively. (E) Proportion of Tr copy genes with expression evidences (RNA-seq FPKM>0) in all tr–d events either lineage-specific or shared by a pair of genomes. The tr–d type is as described in (A) and Tr copy ORF type is as in Fig. 4C and D (pink shade) and Fig. 6C. S. irio genes were excluded due to the lack of RNA-seq data.To test our hypotheses, we shuffled duplicated genomic regions and duplicated genes in tr–d events. Then, we compared the occurrences of randomized tr–d events showing complete duplication of the entire CL copy gene with those observed among actual tr–d events (Fig. 6). First, to detect duplicated genomic regions in a tr–d event, we compared adjacent genomic regions, i.e. 5 kb up- and downstream regions, including the gene, of the CL copy and each of Tr copies. In this comparison, we searched for Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) between the CL and Tr copy loci. As depicted in Fig. 6A, an incomplete tr–d event results in a HGS carrying only a part of the CL copy gene (HGS <U+2285> CL copy), while in a complete tr–d, the HGS encompasses the entire CL copy gene (HGS <U+2287> CL copy). Interestingly, we found a subset of complete tr–d events where the start and end positions of the HGS appeared to overlap with the start and end of the CL copy gene (HGS ˜ CL copy). We named this subset ‘gene-only’ tr–d (Fig. 6A) since the sequence homology was not detectable in the intergenic region further from the CL copy coding regions by more than 20% of the CL copy coding region size. A total of 224 complete tr–d events showed a shift towards longer HGSs, while their CL copy genes (coding regions) were significantly shorter (P < 0.001, two-tailed t-test), compared with those in the 1,166 incomplete tr–d events (Fig. 6B).Following random shuffling of all HSGs and CL copy genes as described in Materials and Methods (2.5), we counted the occurrences of incomplete, complete, and gene-only tr–d events for each iteration. Figure 6C shows the comparison between the observed and expected occurrences of complete and gene-only tr–d events, where expected values were the mean values from 10,000 iterations. Assuming a normal distribution for the expected values, we estimated the P-value for the observed numbers of complete and gene-only LS tr–d events for each genome. Both complete and gene-only tr–d events were much more frequent than expected due to random chance. The gene-only tr–d events had smaller P-values than complete tr–d events in all categories tested except in A. thaliana lineage-specific tr–d events (Fig. 5C, table in the lower panel). We observe a smaller number of lineage-specific tr–d events in A. thaliana than in any other target genome. This may be a result of A. thaliana and A. lyrata being the closest among all pairs, included in the same genus. Hence, we included the Arabidopsis genus-specific tr–d events into consideration, which led to numbers and enrichment of complete and gene-only tr-d events comparable to other genomes (Fig. 5C, ‘Aly–Ath’).Random occurrence of duplications cannot explain the observed proportion of complete tr–d events, which in >90% of the cases also resulted in complete ORFs in the Tr copy loci (e.g. Fig. 4C and D, pink shades). More likely, the observed proportion of complete and gene-only duplications was the sequential result of random duplications and selective retention of beneficial coding regions over time. This explanation is consistent with 4d substitution rates between complete ORFs of Tr copies and CL copies in tr–d events. Higher 4d substitution rates, as a proxy for older duplications, were found between ORFs of Tr and CL copy pairs in gene-only tr–d events (Fig. 6D, ‘go’). This was contrasting to tr–d events where HGSs comprised both gene and intergenic regions (Fig. 6D, ‘g + i’), for both lineage-specific (Fig. 6D, ‘LS’) and indepedent parallel (Fig. 6D, ‘Ind-par’) shared tr–d events. The 4d substitution rates associated with ‘Tr–cl’ type shared tr–d events (Fig. 6D, ‘Tr–cl’) showed median values comparable or higher than the median 4d substitution rates that represent the divergence between A. thaliana and Lineage II genomes (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This further agreed with the notion that a ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d event was derived from duplications dated prior to the divergence of genomes that shared the events.Complete tr–d events also included a higher number of Tr copy genes that showed evidence of expression compared with incomplete tr–d events (Fig. 6E). Incomplete tr–d was associated with most of the Tr copies with truncated ORFs, which comprised the majority of Tr copies in both lineage-specific tr–d (Fig. 4C and D) and independent parallel tr–d events shared by a pair of genomes (Fig. 5C). Out of total 1,706 Tr copies with truncated ORFs, only 135 were derived from complete tr–d events, in which the ORFs were most likely truncated by null mutations after the duplication (Fig. 6E). We found no enrichment of single exon genes, a signature of retrotransposons, among tr–d events (Supplementary Fig. S8).3.6. Genes associated with lineage-specific and shared tr–d eventsSupplementary Table S5 presents a partial list of OrthNets associated with lineage-specific tr–d events for each of the six Brassicaceae genomes, selected based on the most number of Tr copies with complete ORFs and expression evidences, except for S. irio, for which RNAseq data was not available. For each OrthNet listed in Supplementary Table S5, we included numbers of Tr copies tandem duplicated, with complete ORFs, and with expression evidences, as detailed in Supplementary Text S3. The complete list of OrthNets including lineage-specific tr–d events is available in Supplementary Dataset S3. We described genes and gene ontology terms enriched among them in lineage-specific tr–d events in Supplementary Text S3 and Dataset S4.We selected the largest OrthNets with E. salsugineum-specific tr–d events (Supplementary Table S5) and independently visualized the extent of gene duplications using the GEvo tool in the CoGE database35 (Fig. 7). The E. salsugineum genome included six copies of SALT TOLERANCE 32 (SAT32), which exists as a single copy in each of the other Brassicaceae genomes. Among five Tr copies detected for EsSAT32, we found three tandem duplicates (Fig. 7A, ‘Tr copies’). Four of the Tr copies had complete ORFs and three of them showed expression in either root or shoot tissues (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Table S5). The GEvo plot illustrates extensive sequence similarity among all loci and adjacent genomic regions that are reciprocally co-linear among them (Fig. 7B, AtSAT32, SpSAT32, and EsSAT32;1). Similar patterns were observed in comparisons with the S. irio, C. rubella, and A. lyrata co-linear orthologues (data not shown). The EsSAT32 Tr copies (Fig. 7B, EsSAT32;2/3/4/5) represented examples of gene-only tr–d events (Fig. 6A), where sequence similarities were restricted to the expected border regions of the gene models (i.e. ±20% of the coding region size). Interestingly, the Tr copies EsSAT32;3/4/5 also exhibited intron losses, resulting in 9, 1, and 1 exons, respectively, compared with the 13 exons in the CL copy EsSAT32;1 (Fig. 6B), while maintaining high deduced amino acid similarities over most of the coding region (Supplementary Fig. S9). Among all EsSAT paralogues, the highest average expression was observed for one of the Tr copies, EsSAT32;2 (Supplementary Dataset S1, OrthNet ID ON_2516 and gene ID 20188564).

The yellow arrow marks the position of Esa|20181274, which contains a truncated ORF. EsSAT32;3/4/5 showed intron losses without compromising gene products (see text and Supplementary Fig. S9 for details).For tr–d events shared by multiple genomes, we present the entire list of such OrthNets for all pairs of genomes, as well as those associated with Lineages I- and II-specific tr–d events, in Supplementary Dataset S3. The tr–d events shared by E. salsugineum and S. parvula were of particular interest, because they may indicate signatures of convergent evolution between these two species independently adapted to high salinity.47,48Supplementary Table S6 lists all OrthNets with ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d events (as defined in Fig. 5A) shared between these two extremophytes. We also included all Lineage II (i.e. E. salsugineum, S. irio, and S. parvula)-specific tr–d events that had truncated Tr copy ORFs only for S. irio (Supplementary Table S6, marked by superscript ‘e’). Among the ‘Ind-parallel’ tr–d events detected, three out of eight events were associated with stress signalling or response-related functions (Supplementary Table S6, CDPK1, 5PTASE11, and ABI1). However, none of them included complete Tr copy ORFs in both E. salsugineum and S. parvula. Interestingly, the ‘Tr–cl’ category included more loci with Lineage II-specific tr–d followed by truncation of the Tr copy ORF in S. irio, leaving complete ORFs in the Tr copy loci only for E. salsugineum and S. parvula. Here, we found loci encoding orthologues of a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) type transcription factor, a NAC transcription factor (NAC058), and a calcineurin B-like protein 10 (CBL10). All Tr copies encoding these regulatory proteins showed expression evidence in both halophytes (Supplementary Table S6).4. Discussion4.1. A systematic identification of orthologous loci with the same evolutionary historyWhile a number of tools are available to detect co-linearity or synteny blocks among multiple genomes,32,33,49,57,58 there has been a lack of methods which can systematically identify all groups of orthologous gene loci among multiple genomes that underwent the same set of evolutionary events, such as gene duplications and transpositions in a certain lineage or multiple lineages that are either mono-, para-, or polyphyletic. In an attempt to fill this gap, we developed the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline. The CLfinder module detects co-linearity and transposition for individual loci, rather than for synteny blocks, to facilitate identification of single-gene transposition that consist the majority of transposition events1,22 and automatically generates a summary of all pairwise genome comparisons as exemplified in Table 1. The ONfinder module follows the CLfinder and produces OrthNets connecting orthologous genes with edges representing the presence or absence of co-linearity among them, enabling a search based on the network topology for all orthologous gene groups sharing an evolutionary history.Previous works have suggested network representation of synteny among orthologues as an effective method to combine and summarize synteny blocks identified by all-to-all pairwise comparisons among multiple genomes.59 Synteny networks connecting co-linear orthologues from multiple genomes with undirected edges traced the evolutionary path of a gene family.25 This approach has been used to compare the extent of gene duplications and lineage-specific expansion of gene families between mammalian and plant genomes.26 While the CLfinder module similarly performs all-to-all pairwise analyses to detect co-linearity in gene order, OrthNets detected by the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline are different from synteny networks59 in a number of ways. For example, while synteny networks connected co-linear nodes with undirected edges, OrthNets connected nodes with directional edges with co-linearity or lack of it (i.e. transposed) encoded as edge properties. An OrthNet includes orthologues connected by reciprocal edges as well as paralogues derived from duplications connected by unidirectional edges to their neighbouring nodes found in other genomes [Fig. 3A, panels (4) and (5); Figs 4A and 5A]. We aimed to separate each OrthNet into a unit that represents a group of orthologues and paralogues likely derived from a single ancestral locus, by employing Markov clustering (MCL) (Supplementary Text S2). We chose MCL to control edge weights to prefer undirected tandem duplicated edges and reciprocal edges over unidirectional edges during the clustering process. In this way, each of the majority of OrthNets, e.g. >85% of all OrthNets in case of the six Brassicaceae genomes (Fig. 3B), represents the evolutionary history of genes derived from a single ancestral locus as the network topology. Essentially, OrthNets enable detection of all loci from multiple genomes that share the same evolutionary history by a search using a given network topology as the query (e.g. Figs 3A and 5A). We used this functionality to characterized transposition–duplication (tr–d) events in six Brassicaceae genomes, as a proof-of-concept.4.2. Transposition–duplication as a major mechanism for erosion of co-linearityFor the transposition and transposition–duplication (tr–d) of non-TE gene loci, two types of models, retrotransposon-associated and DNA repair or replication-associated models have been suggested as the main mechanisms.60,61 A tr–d event derived from retrotransposons often leads to duplication of single exon genes.62–64 Transposition–duplication may also arise during the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair process of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), where a short sequence motif may act as an anchor to a foreign sequence to fill-in a gap.1 In agreement with this model, a previous comparison of A. lyrata and A. thaliana found a significant enrichment of flanking repeats, as short as 15 bps, among transposed genes.65 The correlation between the proportion of query gene loci showing distal displacement (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1>20 or ‘Diff Chr’) and overall TE contents of the query genome, rather than divergence time (Supplementary Fig. S1D), supports the DSB-repair model. Higher TE contents likely provide a higher frequency of short repeat anchors required for the NHEJ DSB-repair, and TE activities themselves may also cause the DSB that lead to such repairs.1 The DSB-repair model can explain tr–d of multi-exon genes, which constitute the majority of tr–d events found in this study (Supplementary Fig. S8).Among lineage-specific tr–d events captured in OrthNets, we found a subset of transposed–duplicated gene loci (Fig. 4A, Tr copies) retaining similar ORF sizes compared with their respective donor locus (Fig. 4A, CL copy), as well as to orthologues in other species (Fig. 4B–D). The DSB repair model of tr–d suggests that the duplicated region may start and end virtually at any random position in a genome, given that the short sequence motif needed for the repair is likely ubiquitously available and can be as short as several nucleotides.1,65 However, our simulation reveled that both ‘complete’ and ‘gene-only’ tr–d events were far more frequent than what was expected from a random duplication model alone (Fig. 6C). We are not aware of a gene duplication mechanism that preferably duplicates non-TE, protein-coding, multi-exon genes as entire units. Rather, our observation common to all six tested crucifer genomes is likely a result of random tr–d events (e.g. through DSB repair), followed by accumulation of mutations throughout the duplicated regions, except where the complete coding sequences were selectively retained. Supporting this notion, Tr copy genes with complete ORFs were more frequent among shared tr–d of older ‘Tr–cl’ type events (Figs 5C and 6D). These were also more likely to be expressed, hence less likely to be pseudogenes, compared with Tr copies with truncated ORFs (Fig. 6E). See Supplementary Texts for further discussions on the age of ‘gene-only’ tr–d events (Supplementary Text S4) and on tr–d frequencies and TE contents (Supplementary Text S5). Overall, our analyses depicted the landscape of tr–d events among Brassicaceae genomes, where the majority of tr–d was incomplete, while small numbers of tr–d including complete Tr copy ORFs and gene-only tr–d were likely to have resulted from random duplication events followed by selective retention of coding sequences over time.4.3. Search for extremophyte-specific tr–d events using CLfinder-OrthNetOne possible application of the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline is to retrieve orthologues sharing evolutionary events unique to a lineage with a specific trait or multiple lineages exhibiting a convergent trait, e.g. the two extremophyte S. parvula and E. salsugineum. As detailed in Supplementary Text S6, these two genomes have been identified with gene copy number and structural variations compared with A. thaliana that were associated with stress-adapted traits.10,66,67 In this study, CLfinder-OrthNet identified 63, 26, and 14 orthologue groups, represented as OrthNets, showing gene copy number increases through tr–d events specific to E. salsugineum, S. parvula, and both, respectively (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Table S6, and Dataset S3). These numbers are orders of magnitude fewer than previous searches from a pairwise comparison with A. thaliana,5 signifying the vastly improved resolution in finding extremophyte-specific events.The OrthNet for the SALT-TOLERANCE 32 (SAT32) locus (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Table S5, ON_2516) represents the largest E. salsugineum-specific tr–d event. SAT32 encodes a transcription regulator, whose expression level positively correlated with the survival rate of the model plant A. thaliana under salt stress.68 Three of the four EsSAT32 paralogues with complete ORFs exhibited intron losses (Fig. 7B andSupplementary Fig. S9). Intron losses and smaller transcript sizes are reported to enable regulation of expression timing in Drosophila and mouse.69,70 It is not clear whether ‘gene-only’ tr–d events (Fig. 7B) among EsSAT32 paralogues is indicative of reverse transcriptase-mediated duplication leading to intron losses71 or different rate of mutation between gene and intergenic regions. Either way, such variation in intergenic regions including promoter regions may lead to sub-functionalization.2 At least three EsSAT32 paralogues exhibited different basal expression strengths in root and shoot tissues (data not shown).A notable example of S. parvula-specific tr–d, with copy number increases in complete ORFs, is the ZRT/IRT-LIKE PROTEIN 3 (ZIP3) locus encoding a zinc transporter (Supplementary Table S5). This particular tr–d may be a signature of an adaptation in S. parvula, to soils that are highly saline and also depleted in micronutrients such as zinc and iron in central Anatolia.72,73 See Supplementary Text S7 and S8 for discussions on genes involved in tr–d unique to each extremophyte, as well as tr–d shared by the two extremophytes.4.4. Concluding remarks: CLfinder-OrthNet, a flexible toolkit for comparative genomicsThe CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline, in a proof-of-concept application, successfully encodes more than 85% of entire loci among six Brassicaceae genomes into OrthNet units in which evolutionary histories of genes derived from single ancestral loci can be traced (Fig. 3B). Using a network topology-based search, we identified groups of orthologues, represented as OrthNets that share the same evolutionary histories (Fig. 3A), including tr–d unique to any subset of the six Brassicaceae genomes (Figs 4 and 5, Supplementary Dataset S3).As detailed in Supplementary Text S9, CLfinder-OrthNet offers multiple options to apply the pipeline flexibly depending on target genomes and goals of the study. The sensitivity and stringency of co-linearity detection are adjustable by controlling parameters depending on the range of target genomes. The CLfinder module can use results from any method of sequence clustering and comparison, as well as genomic features other than protein-coding genes, as inputs. Moreover, the two modules can be used separately. For example, researchers can use the CLfinder module to quickly summarize the distribution of co-linear, tandem duplicated, and transposed genes among multiple genomes (e.g. Table 1), while the ONfinder module can accept locus-level synteny information from other methods to generate OrthNets.Overall, the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline offers a flexible toolkit to compare the arrangement of gene and other genomic features among multiple genomes. Future applications include, but not limited to, tracing evolutionary histories of a gene or gene families; inference of orthology based on both sequence homology and co-linearity; studying incongruence between sequence homology and synteny; and identification of candidate gene copy number variations associated with specific hypothesis-driven evolutionary mechanisms or traits.FundingThis work was supported by National Science Foundation (MCB 1616827) and the Next Generation BioGreen21 Program (PJ01317301) of the Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.Supplementary dataSupplementary data (Supplementary Texts S1-S9, Tables S1-S6, Figures S1-S9, and Dataset S2-S4) are available at DNARES online.

IntroductionThe prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide and currently 10–15% of the global population suffer from CKD and its devastating complications.1 Although the adult human kidney has some ability to recover from acute kidney injury through cellular proliferation of the damaged intrarenal tissues, regenerating nephrons through de novo nephron development is considered unlikely, as the formation of new nephrons in humans is terminated at the embryonic stages. However, renal regeneration through nephron neogenesis in the event of renal injury has been described in some fish species and the possibility of this happening in mammalian species has not been excluded. Members of the bear family (Ursidae) might be such species and studying how they deal with periods of decreased kidney function during hibernation (biomimicry) could be a new approach to understand kidney disease and develop new treatments.2The American black bear hibernates for up to 7 months annually. During this period, they do not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate. Bear hibernation is a state similar to prolonged sleep during which body temperature is reduced by 1–8°C,3 there is a 20–50% reduction in metabolic rate with a depressed heart rate,4 and the volume of urine produced is reduced by 95%.5 The small volumes of urine and urea that enter the bladder during hibernation are reabsorbed across the bladder epithelium,5 and the urea is recycled for production of new protein.6 Throughout hibernation the kidney continues to concentrate urine and produces renin,7 erythropoietin,5 and vitamin D 1-a-hydroxylase.8 Hibernating bears have the ability to prevent azotemia (high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood, common in human patients with renal function), but the mechanism is unknown.Understanding these processes could lead to creating novel therapies for treating human conditions related to resistance to the complications of CKD and recovery from acute kidney injury. The studies aforementioned suggest unique kidney features in the American black bear allowing them to endure lower functioning during hibernation and recovery soon after hibernation. They are likely in part encoded in the genome sequence and gene expression patterns unique to the bear. To address this, we have performed high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA and RNA isolated from kidneys of wild black bears. We generated a de novo assembly and annotation of the complete genome and compared transcription profiles of kidneys collected in the spring (within weeks after hibernation) and in the fall (before hibernation).2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collection, library preparation and sequencingBear samples were obtained by hunters during the hunting seasons in Maine. Hunters were asked to participate on a voluntary base and no bears were killed for the specific purpose of this study. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The whole-genome library was prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wilmington, MA) with a bead-based size selection to select for inserts with an average size of 400 bp and 6 cycles of PCR. Sequencing was done on two 2 × 125 bp Illumina 2500 lanes. The mate pair library was prepared using the Illumina Nexera Mate Pair Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a gel-based size selection to select for inserts with an average size of 10 kb and 14 cycles of PCR. Sequencing was done on two 2 × 100 bp Illumina HiSeq 2500 lanes. The PacBio library was prepared using the Pacific Biosciences SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using the ‘20-kb Template Preparation Using BluePippin Size-Selection System (15-kb Size cutoff)’ protocol obtained from PacBio SampleNet. The BluePippin was set to collect from 7 to 50 kb. Sequencing was done on 23 PacBio SMRT cells. For RNA-Seq, hunters collected kidneys and stored them in liquid nitrogen. Kidneys were first homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) and an aliquot was used for RNA isolation using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturers’ protocols, including the optional DNase digest step. Quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip assay (Agilent). We prepared total RNA for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq methodology (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold). The first step involves the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using biotinylated, target-specific oligos, combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. After individual samples were bar-coded they were pooled and sequencing was done on two 2 × 75 bp Illumina NextSeq 2500 lanes. All raw data have been submitted to the NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under accession number SRP075217.2.2. Sequence assemblyAll data were subjected to quality control check9 and samples with base qualities greater =30 over 70% of read length were used in the downstream analysis. KmerFreq_HA v2.0 and Corrector_HA v2.01 tools of SOAPec_v2.0110 were further used to perform K-mer frequency generation and error correction of paired-end and mate-pair data, respectively. SOAPdenovo-127mer (v2.04)10 was used to perform the contig and scaffold assembly from paired end and mate-pair libraries (avg_ins = 350 and 10 K for paired-end and mate-pair, respectively). After the assembly, gaps in scaffolds were closed with the GapCloser tool (v1.12)10 (with -l 125) of the soap module. Smaltmap, perfectfrombam and pipeline tools of the reapr module (v 1.0.17)11 was used to recognize the errors in the assembly by re-mapping of paired-end and mate-pair data to the de novo assembled genome. The assembly was broken at potential misassembled points. The broken assembly was further used as an input for the jelly tool of the PBSuite12 (v15.2.20) with blasr (v1.3.1) at parameters [—minMatch 8—minPctIdentity 80—bestn 1—nCandidates 20—maxScore—500]. This tool was used to upgrade the existing Illumina assembly with low-pass PacBio data. Repeat masking was performed by downloading the Repbase TE library from the repbase server (http://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/). To identify known TE elements, we used repeat masker and repeat protein mask software in the Repeat Masker package (www.repeatmasker.org), which identifies TEs by aligning the genome sequence to a defined TE database. Tandem repeats were predicted using TRF13 by using the default parameters ‘Match = 2, Mismatch = 7, Delta = 7, PM = 80, PI = 10, Minscore = 50, and MaxPeriod = 12’. The completeness of the assembly was estimated by using CEGMA.14 The assembly was screened against a collection of 248 universal eukaryotic single-copy genes. Core eukaryotic gene datasets were downloaded and a blast database was made from the assembly before running CEGMA. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession LZNR00000000. Version LZNR01000000 is described in this work. It is also available at ftp://ftp.jax.org/maine_blackbear_project/.2.3. AnnotationThe black bear genome assembly was annotated using Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT—https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/Comparative-Annotation-Toolkit). CAT uses whole genome alignments generated by progressiveCactus15 to project gene annotations from a high quality reference genome on to one or more target genomes. This process leverages previously curated annotation sets to rapidly construct a set of orthologues in the target genomes. After transcript projection,16 the protein coding projections are provided to the ab-initio gene finding tool AUGUSTUS17 with additional extrinsic information derived from RNA-Seq. AUGUSTUS then enforces a coding gene model that allows for shifts in splice sites to maintain frame. This process can also rescue exons that did not align in the whole genome alignment. CAT also performs true ab-initio gene prediction by using a new method of running AUGUSTUS called Comparative Augustus, or AugustusCGP.18 This parameterization simultaneously predicts genes in all species in a progressiveCactus alignment, using RNA-Seq data in one or more species to help guide the annotation process. After projection, clean-up and ab-initio prediction, CAT combines these separate transcript sets into one final gene set through a consensus finding process. For orthologous transcripts, the transcript with the best fidelity to the reference with the best extrinsic support is chosen. In the case where multiple paralogous projections are found, CAT selects the most likely orthologue through a combination of splice junction fidelity, synteny and alignment identity. Finally, ab-initio predictions from AugustusCGP are evaluated for providing new information. If significant overlap with an orthologous projection is found, and the transcript provides a new splice junction or exon, then it is included as a new isoform of the orthologue. Otherwise, the locus is considered a candidate for a novel gene, often a gene family expansion. In addition to an annotation set on target genomes, CAT produces a UCSC Assembly Hub.19 This assembly hub has tracks for the raw transMap projections, the post-filtering projections, the various modes of AUGUSTUS employed, the final consensus annotation set, as well as the input RNA-Seq information including a filtered splice junction track. All annotations are stored in a modified bigBed format with a wide variety of various additional features annotated on each entry, which can be accessed from the details page for that entry. Additional features include RNA-Seq support for specific splice junctions and binary classifiers such as having a frame-shifting indel relative to the source transcript. In addition to the genome-specific tracks, an alignment track (snake track) shows the cactus alignment between the current species and other species. Browsing this assembly hub provides the opportunity to visualize the relationship between all aligned species and the various ways the transcript projections were filtered and combined with ab-initio predictions. Assembly hub can be visualized by visiting UCSC ‘Track Data Hubs’ (https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html) and then adding URL ftp://ftp.jax.org/maine_blackbear_project/assemblyHub/hub.txt under the ‘My Hubs’ tab. For the black bear project, the cactus alignment generated contained black bear, horse (equCab2), dog (canFam3), polar bear (GCA_000687225.1), elephant (loxAfr3), human (hg38), and mouse (mm10) using the following guide phylogenetic tree: ((Human: 0.145908, Mouse: 0.356483)human_mouse_anc: 0.020593,(Horse: 0.109397,(Dog: 0.052458,(Polar_bear: 0.01, Maine_black_bear: 0.01)bear_anc: 0.08)dog_bear_anc: 0.069845)horse_dog_bear_anc: 0.043625)root; CAT was run using the Dog Ensembl V87 annotation set as the reference. RNA-Seq was obtained from SRA for dog (SRR2960309, SRR2960315, SRR2960317, SRR2960319, SRR2960320, SRR2960321, SRR2960328, SRR3727716, SRR3727717, SRR3727718, SRR3727719, SRR3727720, SRR3727722, SRR3727723, SRR3727724, SRR3727725, SRR5018836) and for polar bear (SRR950076, SRR950074) and aligned to their respective genomes. In addition, RNA-Seq was generated for Maine black bear as part of this project.2.4. Gene expression analysis and RNA editingSamples were aligned to the soft masked Bear Assembly using STAR aligner (v2.5.3) (—sjdbOverhang 75—quantMode GeneCounts—twopassMode Basic) with known annotation. STAR provided the expression count matrix was used for differential expression analysis with DESeq2. The genes with FDR <= 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed between spring and fall Samples. STAR generated bam were further processed by picard MarkDuplicates and GATK SplitNCigarReads to remove the duplicates and split reads into exonic segments and hard clip any reads hanging into the intronic region, respectively. The final bam of all 12 samples were used to perform the join variant calling by HaplotypeCaller (v3.4-0). The output of HaplotypeCaller was further processed to identify the sites showed alternate allele in all 12 samples or that were genotype as reference in all six samples of one season and as alternate allele in the other season. We further filtered variants to set of canonical editing sites (and their reverse complementary). RNA editing prediction tool-REDItools was used to confirm the filtered sites, strand identification and its count was used as final count to estimate the editing frequency. These sites were subjected to confirmation in DNA-seq data generated for six samples. The whole genome sequence data of these bears were subjected to quality trimming and aligned by bwa-mem (v0.7.9a). The alignments were converted to bam and processed by Picard-MarkDuplicates to remove the duplicates from the data. Afterwards, the Genome Analysis tool kit module IndelRealigner was used to pre-process the alignments. The realigned bam file was processed to identify the coverage at potential editing sites. The sites with at least one DNA-seq sample support were included in final set for experimental validation. Gene expression profiles from embryonic mouse kidneys were downloaded from NCBI GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi? acc=GSE3808).20 Six samples representing three time points (two replicates each) were used in the analysis. For the analysis, E12.5, E13.5, and E16.5 were considered early & late age samples, respectively. GEO samples accessions of array data are GSM87387, GSM87388, GSM87389, GSM87390, GSM87391, and GSM87392. Samples were normalized using the affy package21 and GenBank accession for the probs (Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A Array) were downloaded from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi? acc=GPL339). We extracted the MGI Gene IDs corresponding to GenBank accession using mouse genome informatics database (http://www.informatics.jax.org), performed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the mouse array data and created a PCA biplot (Supplementary Table S10). To map the differentially expressed (DE) bear genes on the PCA biplot, we first extracted the corresponding dog gene Ensembl id from the bear generic feature format file (gff) and extracted the Ensembl id of mouse gene orthologues of dog from biomart.22 Only genes with homology type: ‘ortholog_one2one’, orthology confidence: high and Query: target & target: query identity (=50%) between dog and mouse were selected (153 genes remaining at the end) for mapping. Finally, we extracted the MGI:ID for the mouse ensembl id and mapped it on the mouse PCA biplot to create an eggogram (Fig. 5) and performed an analysis for significance (Supplementary Fig. S4).3. Results3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the black bear genomeThe ability to explore the black bear genome for unique features and to facilitate gene expression analysis depends on an assembled and well-annotated genome. High-throughput sequencing of the black bear genome has been previously reported,23 but only using Illumina short-read sequencing to a ~30× average depth of coverage. We improved this coverage by extracted DNA from a single male Maine black bear (JAX001) and sequencing it using three methods: paired-end sequencing and mate-pair sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and single molecule sequencing using the PacBio RSII system (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Raw reads were assembled into 113,759 scaffolds and contigs =1,000 bases with an N50 length of 190 kb, totalling 2.59 Gb in length (Supplementary Table S4). This is slightly larger than the estimated size of the panda bear assembly (2.46 Gb)24 and the polar bear assembly (2.53 Gb).23We estimated the quality of the assembled sequence by mapping all paired-end reads back to the assembled genome with Burrows–Wheeler Aligner25 to determine the mappability and median coverage of the assembled genome. Approximately 90% of reads mapped back to the assembly with a mapping quality of =30 and with a median coverage of 43×. The peak sequencing depth was 50×, and more than 20 reads covered over 85% of the assembled sequences (Fig. 1a). The completeness of our assembly was estimated using CEGMA by screening against 248 highly conserved core eukaryotic genes. Our black bear assembly covers 212 out of 248 genes completely and 241 out of 248 genes partially. Figure 1b shows this 85.5% completeness compared with 88.7% for the panda bear assembly and 90.7% for the polar bear assembly, which are all comparable. GC content in mammals is correlated with a number of genomic features that are functionally relevant, for example, gene density, transposable element distribution, and methylation rate. The GC-content distribution in the black bear covers a narrower range compared with the panda bear and the polar bear (Fig. 1c). This might be a consequence of the lower amount of repetitive sequences that is present in the black bear genome (Fig. 2). Thus, we were able to establish a genome assembly of good coverage and quality for the black bear, comparable with polar bear and panda bear.Sequencing depth and comparison of several characteristics of the black bear, panda, and polar bear genome assemblies.

Annotation of the black bear genomeSimilar to the panda genome,26 our black bear genome assembly was annotated using the Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT). CAT identified 29,624 genes (18,091 coding) in our black bear assembly, representing 88% of the genes present in the dog annotation. In addition, 2,995 transcripts with at least 2 splices were predicted by AugustusCGP, which also had at least one intron junction supported by RNA-Seq and not supported by transMap. Of these, 1,730 were associated with a transMapped gene and assigned as a novel isoform of that gene. The remainder were evaluated for being putatively novel loci. Six hundred and fifty-three loci were identified as being possibly paralogous, which is defined as overlapping a paralogous transMap projection, which was dropped in paralogue resolution. Twenty-eight loci were identified as possible false fusions, defined as having >80% overlap with more than one transMap projection. Four hundred and fifty-eight loci were identified as poor alignments, which are predictions in regions, which have alignment to a known gene but did not pass transMap filtering. This left 126 putatively novel loci. Of the 22,081 orthologous protein coding transcripts identified, pairwise codon-aware alignments of coding sequences identified frame-shifting indels in 7,848 transcripts. A slight enrichment of frame-shifting deletions was seen relative to insertions, suggesting a systematic bias in the assembly process.3.3. High-throughput sequencing of renal RNA and differential expression between fall and springKidneys were collected in the fall (animals JAX118, JAX134, JAX141, JAX146, JAX160, and JAX165), before hibernation, and in the spring (animals JAX101, JAX 103, JAX106, JAX113, JAX136, and JAX140), shortly after the bears emerged from hibernation (three males and three females for each time point). The timing of sample collection was (in part) driven by practicality. It was only possible to collect samples during a few specific periods, which were the late fall, before hibernation, and early spring, approximately 1 or 2 weeks after the animals come out of hibernation. Approximately 60 million RNA-Seq reads were obtained from each sample before quality control (Supplementary Table S5). After appropriate quality control and correction for batch effect, we performed a PCA (Supplementary Fig. S1a) and determined that sample 101 (from a male in the spring) was an outlier (see Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S9). After removing this sample and repeating the analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1b) we compared the spring samples to the fall samples. We identified 169 differentially expressed protein-coding genes with an adjusted P-value below 0.05, of which CISH, SLCO1C1, and NDST3 showed a >2-fold change (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S6). Of these, 101 genes were downregulated and 68 genes were upregulated after hibernation. Fold changes ranged only from 1.8-fold downregulation (RTN4RL2) to 2.4-fold upregulation (CISH). Figure 4 shows a heatmap for all 11 bears with the 50 most significant genes (Supplementary Fig. S2 shows all 169 genes). Pathway enrichment analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) of the 169 genes did not identify any specific pathways. However, most notable was the upregulation of three cytokine suppression genes (SOCS2, CISH, and SERPINC1) and the lack of increased cytokine expression (e.g. IL6, CCL2, CCL6) and damage markers (LCN2 and HAVCR1) normally seen in lower functioning or recovering kidneys of other species.27Volcano plot of the differential gene expression between spring and fall with CISH, SLC01C1, and NDST3 being upregulated >2-fold in the spring compared with the fall.Volcano plot of the differential gene expression between spring and fall with CISH, SLC01C1, and NDST3 being upregulated >2-fold in the spring compared with the fall.Cluster analysis of the gene expression profiles showing the 50 genes with the lowest P-value.Cluster analysis of the gene expression profiles showing the 50 genes with the lowest P-value.Because of the lack in inflammatory response, we asked whether the differentially expressed genes matched a particular development stage of the kidney. We used a method previously employed to place human cancers on a developmental landscape.28 First, we obtained gene expression profiles from mouse kidneys at different developmental stages (from E12.5 through E16.5) that were deposited in NCBI GEO and plotted the developmental expression profile in their first two temporal principal components (PC1-2). The high-dimensional expression profiles are simplified into a developmental timeline, ordering the genes in a linear array based on their temporal pattern of expression. Early genes are localized on the left end, genes with no bias towards early or late expression centre in the middle and late genes localize the right end. Thus, the unique order of genes on the timeline represents a summary of early and late states for each developmental process. Next, we matched the differentially expressed bear genes with their mouse orthologues (153 out of 169 genes) and plotted their location on the developmental timeline for the genes that were expressed in the developing kidney (109 genes). We observed clustering of downregulated genes with the early mouse genes (E12.5) and clustering of upregulated genes with the late mouse genes (16.5) (Fig. 5). The processes that take place in the E12.5 kidney are focused on progenitor cell dynamics, FGF, and Wnt signaling, which we know are pro-fibrotic in the adult. In contrast, E16.5 is very different as it involves glomerulogenesis, tubulogenesis and maturation.The mouse kidney developmental expression profile at E12.5–E16.5 in their first two temporal principal components (PC1-2) with the mouse orthologues of genes that are downregulated after hibernation in blue and genes that are upregulated in red.

Color figure is available at online version.Taken together, despite the many months of reduced renal function and downregulated metabolism during hibernation, the gene expression differences between spring and fall bears is limited both in number of genes that are differentially expressed, fold-change, and the lack of upregulation of genes that are typically seen in other species after a period of low function or damage. In fact, the expression profile of bears coming out of hibernation resembles a developmental stage.3.4. Identification of RNA-editing in the black bear kidneyOur RNA-Seq data identified possible RNA-editing in a small set of genes when aligning the reads to our assembled genome sequence. To rule out the possibility of variation in the transcripts due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomes of the bears for which we performed the RNA-Seq, we sequenced the genomes of bears 101, 103, 113, 118, 134, and 160 at a low coverage (Supplementary Table S7). After comparing with the genome sequences and filtering for protein-coding transcripts we identified 38 transcripts containing a different variant (between 10% and 95% of the total reads) from the genome sequence (Supplementary Table S8). Of these 38 transcripts, 30 (79%) show A-to-I editing, while the other sites have C-to-U editing. Almost half of the edited sites are in the coding region and five are predicted to lead to an amino acid change.According to the REDIportal (http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/) RNA-editing has been observed in four of the genes in the human kidney (although not at the same base pair) and for one gene, FLNB, RNA-editing also occurs both in the human and the mouse kidney. Interestingly, RNA-editing in 37 of the transcripts is observed in most or all 12 bears, but for ZNF688 we find editing in all 6 spring bears and no editing in the 6 fall bears.To confirm our observations in the high-throughput sequencing data, we randomly selected eight editing sites and designed primers flanking these sites that could discriminate between RNA and possible genomic DNA contamination. Subsequent Sanger sequencing confirmed all eight editing sites (Supplementary Table S8).4. DiscussionPrevious studies in bears suggest they have unique features in the kidney that allow them to endure lower renal functioning during hibernation and recovery soon after hibernation. As these features are likely in part encoded in the genome sequence and gene expression patterns unique to the bear, we set out to explore the genome sequence and renal gene expression of the American black bear (Ursus americanus).A first important step was to establish the complete annotated genome sequence. To accomplish this, we used three approaches for sequencing a single male bear with 100× coverage before filtering. This resulted in a final, high quality, assembly. This current genome is comparable in quality and size to the published panda genome24 and polar bear genome.23 A comparison between the three genomes shows a narrower range in GC-content in the black bear (Fig. 1c), likely the result of fewer repetitive sequences caused by transposon integration (Fig. 2).The new Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT) pipeline allowed us to establish a high-quality annotation of the genome with 22,081 protein coding transcripts and identification of 126 putative novel loci that warrant further investigation as to their uniqueness and possible function.Based on the reported changes in the bear kidney function during hibernation,5 we expected we would find a signature of these changes in the gene expression of kidneys collected soon after hibernation when compared with kidneys collected before hibernation. We therefore collected samples from 3 male and 3 female bears (samples were collected within 10 days from each other) soon after hibernation and from 3 male and 3 female bears before hibernation. One limitation is that the time between waking up from hibernation and sample collection is unknown and we assumed it was similar for all animals. Deviation from this assumption is expected to lead to more variation in the gene expression profile. RNA-Seq analysis identified 169 protein coding genes that were differentially expressed between the two time points. Of these, 101 genes were downregulated and 68 genes were upregulated after hibernation. Fold changes only ranged from 1.8-fold downregulation (RTN4RL2) to 2.4-fold upregulation (CISH) and only three genes showed a >2-fold change (CISH, SLCO1C1, and NDST3). Little is known about the function in the kidney of these genes: CISH is a member of the SOCS family and involved in suppression of cytokine signaling through the JAK-STAT5 pathway. SLCO1C1 is a member of the organic anion transport family and best known for mediating sodium-independent uptake of thyroid hormones in brain tissue. NDST3 is a member of the heparan sulphate/heparin GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulphotransferase family and increased expression indicates an increase in N-sulphation of heparin sulphate in the kidney. Since kidney glucosaminoglycans have been shown to be related to the ability of turtles to conserve water,29 it can be speculated that the increased expression of NDST3 in hibernating black bear kidneys protect the animals during the long period of dehydration during winter sleep. Moreover, since the endothelial glycocalyx on the vascular endothelial cells plays a major role in albuminuria and kidney disease,30 it could be speculated that upregulation of NDST3 may protect the endothelial glycocalyx in bear kidneys during the anuric hibernation.Most notable among the differentially expressed genes was the upregulation of cytokine suppression genes (SOCS2, CISH, and SERPINC1) in the post-hibernating bears and the lack of increased cytokine expression (such as IL6 and CCL2) and damage markers such as HAVCR1 (KIM-1) and LCAN (NGAL). Pathway enrichment analysis (IPA) did not identify any pathways that were significantly overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. These findings support previous observation that despite several pro-inflammatory risk factors during the hibernation period (such as kidney dysfunction and immobilization), there are no signs of systemic inflammation.31 This is further supported by our PCA in which the genes that are downregulated after hibernation cluster with a developmental stage in which FGF and Wnt signaling, which we know are pro-fibrotic in the adult kidney, play an important role and genes that are upregulated after hibernation cluster with a developmental stage in which glomerulogenesis, tubulogenesis and maturation are important. In patients with CKD, systemic inflammation is a common finding that promotes premature aging and predicts poor outcome.32Although this is the first study in which gene expression is analysed in kidney tissue, it is not the first in which gene expression in bears has been examined. Fedorov et al. analysed samples from captive bears that were either kept in hibernating or non-hibernating conditions with a custom microarray. They analysed heart and liver samples and found 245 differentially expressed genes in the heart and 319 genes in the liver.33 We were able to map the majority (85.2%) of their ESTs onto our genome assembly and match them to our transcripts. However, none of the genes that were found to be differentially expressed in heart and liver overlapped with differentially expressed genes in the kidney. The lack of overlap could be due to difference in experimental conditions such as the timing of tissue harvest. Alternatively, it may indicate that while nearly every tissue adapts to hibernation, the ensemble of genes involved is highly tissue-specific.Overall, both the number of differentially expressed genes and the fold-changes are low, but are in line with the findings of Federov et al. Although it has been shown that American black bears maintain a reduced metabolic rate for up to 3 weeks after emerging from their dens,3 a possible explanation for our results is that the kidneys already completely recovered from hibernation within the short time between emerging from hibernation and sample collection. Another explanation is that the reduction in metabolic rate and urine production has a much smaller impact on the kidney than would be predicted.Our RNA-Seq data also identified the presence of RNA editing, which was confirmed for all sites that were tested with Sanger sequencing. Several of the genes that are edited also show RNA-editing in mouse and human, but at different positions (Supplementary Table S8). The most interesting is the RNA editing in the 3' UTR of the transcriptional regulator ZNF688, which only seems to happen in the spring. This suggests season-dependent RNA-editing and a possible mechanism through which gene expression is altered.In conclusion, we established a high-quality and well-annotated genome sequence of the black bear (U. americanus). RNA-Seq of kidney samples before and after hibernation shows RNA-editing and the modest differential expression of a set of 169 genes that might be involved in the unique stress response due to hibernation in the bear. Our results suggest that during hibernation, changes in gene expression favours anti-inflammatory pathways. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of these expression differences in the kidney.The authors thank Heidi Munger, Ryan Lynch, Edith Schriever, Lucy Rowe, and Xiaoan Ruan, for technical assistance, and Carol Bult, Peter Stenvinkel, Leif Oxburgh, and Paul Shiels for discussion and critical review of the manuscript.

IntroductionLigases repair breaks in nucleic acids, and this activity is essential for cell viability and vitality. DNA ligases catalyse the formation of a phosphodiester bond between DNA ends and play crucial roles in DNA repair, recombination, and replication in vivo.1–3 RNA ligases join the 5'-phosphoryl (5'PO4) and 3'-hydroxyl (3'OH) RNA termini via phosphodiester bonds and are involved in RNA repair, splicing, and editing.4 Ligases from all three kingdoms of organisms (bacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes) can be utilized in vitro as important molecular tools for applications such as cloning, ligase-based amplification or detection, and synthetic biology.5–7One of the most widely used ligases in vitro is bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, which is a single 55-kDa polypeptide that requires ATP as an energy source.8 T4 DNA ligase typically joins the adjacent 5'PO4 and 3'OH termini of duplexed DNA. In addition to sealing nicks and ligating cohesive ends, T4 DNA ligase can also efficiently catalyse blunt-end joining, which has not been observed for any other DNA ligases9 (http://www.epibio.com/enzymes/ligases-kinases-phosphatases/dna-ligases/ampligase-thermostable-dna-ligase? details (15 October 2018, date last accessed)). Some unusual catalytic properties of this ligase were reported previously, such as sealing single-stranded gaps in duplex DNA, sealing nicks adjacent to abasic sites in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), promoting intramolecular loop formation with partially double-stranded DNA, and joining DNA strands containing 3' branch extensions.10–12 Researchers also observed template-independent ligation mediated by T4 ligase, such as mis-paired nick sealing in dsDNA13 or even single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ligation, albeit at very low efficiency.14 These results suggest that perfect complementary base pairing at or adjacent to the ligation junction is not critically needed for some unconventional T4 DNA ligase activities. T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2 are the products of genes 63 and 24, respectively, of T4 phage. Both require an adjacent 5'PO4 and 3'OH end for a successful ligation with the concurrent hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and PPi. The substrates for T4 RNA ligase 1 include single-stranded RNA and DNA, whereas T4 RNA ligase 2 preferentially seals nicks on dsRNA rather than ligating the ends of ssRNA.15,16Here, we demonstrate a non-conventional end-joining event mediated by T4 DNA ligase that we call 3'-branch ligation (3'BL). This method can join DNA or DNA/RNA fragments at nicks, single-stranded gaps, or 3'-recessive ends to form a branch structure. This report includes extensive study of a wide variety of ligation cofactors and activators and the optimization of the ligation conditions for this type of novel ligation. With our 3'BL protocol, no base pairing was required, and the ligation can reach 70–90% completion in most cases, including for a 1-nt gap. One application of this method is the attachment of adapters to DNA or RNA during NGS library preparation. Several genomic structures that were previously considered unligatable can now be used as substrates for 3'BL, resulting in a high conversion rate of input DNA into adapter-ligated molecules while avoiding chimeras. We demonstrate that 3'BL can be coupled with transposon tagmentation to increase library yield. The directional tagmentation strategy we propose will theoretically produce templates 100% of which can be utilized for sequencing. Our study demonstrated the value of this novel technique for NGS library preparation and the potential to advance many other molecular applications.2. Materials and methods2.1. 3'-Branch ligation for duplex DNAThe substrates for 3'BL were composed of 2 pmol of ON1 or ON9 mixed with 4 pmol each of one or two additional oligos in pH 8 Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (Life Technologies) as follows: substrates 1 and 5 (nick), ON-1/2/3 and ON-9/10/11; substrates 2 and 6 (1-nt gap), ON1/2/4 and ON9/10/12; substrate 3 (8-nt gap), ON1/4/5; substrates 4 and 9 (3'-recessive end), ON1/2 and ON9/10; substrate 7 (2-nt gap), ON9/10/13; substrate 8 (3-nt gap), ON9/10/14; blunt-end control, ON1 and ON6 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). The template was ligated to 1.5–5 µM of adapter (Ad-G: ON7/8, Ad-T: ON15/16, Ad-A: ON17/8, Ad-GA: ON19/20) using 20 units/µl of T4 ligase (Enzymatics, Inc.) in 3'BL buffer [0.05 mg/ml BSA (New England Biolabs), 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.8 (Amresco), 10 mM MgCl2 (EMD Millipore), 0.5 mM DTT (VWR Scientific), 10% PEG-8000 (Sigma Aldrich), and 1 mM ATP (Sigma Aldrich)]. The reaction volume was 30, 40, or 60 µl. The optimization tests were conducted by altering the ATP concentration from 1 µM to 1 mM, the Mg2+ concentration from 3 to 10 mM, the pH value from 3 to 9, temperature from 12 to 42°C, and adjusting additives such as PEG-8000 from 2.5% to 10% and SSB from 2.5 to 20 ng/µl. The ligation mixture was prepared on ice and incubated at 37°C for 1–12 h before heat inactivation at 65°C for 15 min. Ligation products were assayed on TBE gels without further purification (Fig. 2). The samples run on denaturing polyacrylamide gels were purified using either home-made PEG32 beads [Axygen beads (Corning) mixed with 32% PEG] or Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo research). All gels were visualized on an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech). An input control was loaded at either an equal quantity or half the quantity of the template used for ligation. A ligation efficiency rate was estimated by dividing the intensity of ligated products by the total intensity of ligated and unligated products using ImageJ Software (NIH). Optimized reaction conditions were used unless otherwise noted.3' Branch ligation by T4 DNA ligase at non-conventional DNA ends formed by nicks, gaps, and overhangs.

For T4 DNA ligase-mediated 3'BL, the substrate was incubated with Ad-T (ON15/16) in 3'BL buffer as described above and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. 3'BL using T4 RNA ligase 1 or 2 was performed in 1× RNA ligase buffer (NEB) with either 20% DMSO or 25% PEG. All ligation products were assayed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.2.3. Directional tagmentation library constructionThe transposon oligonucleotides used in this experiment were synthesized by Sangon Biotech. For the 2 transposon experiments using TnA/TnB, oligos for TnA (ON24), TnB (ON25), and MErev (ON26) were annealed at a 1:1:2 ratio. For the single transposon experiment with TnA, ON24 and ON26 were annealed at a 1:1 ratio. For the Y (TnA&TnB) transposon experiment, ON24 and ON27 were annealed at a 1:1 ratio.Transposon assembly was performed by mixing 100 pmol of pre-annealed adapters, 7 µl of Tn5 transposase, and sufficient glycerol to obtain a total 20 -µl reaction, which was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. Tagmentation of genomic DNA (Coriell 12878) was performed in 20 -µl reactions containing 100 ng of gDNA, TAG buffer (homemade), and 1 µl of the assembled transposon. The reaction was incubated at 55°C for 10 min; 40 µl of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma) was then added to remove the transposon complex from tagmented DNA, and DNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). The gap ligation of AdB (ON28 and ON29) to the tagmented DNA was performed at 25°C for 1 h in reactions containing 100 pmol of the adapter, 600 U of T4 DNA ligase (Enzymatics, Inc.), and 3'BL buffer. Reactions were purified using AMPure XP beads. PCR amplification of tagmented and gap-ligated DNA was performed in 50 -µl reactions containing 2 µl of the tagmented or gap-ligated DNA, TAB buffer, 1 µl TruePrep Amplify Enzyme (Vazyme), 200 mM dNTPs (Enzymatics, Inc.), and 400 mM each of primers Pr-A and Pr-B. Tagmented reactions were incubated as follows: 72°C for 3 min; 98°C for 30 s; 8 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min; and 72°C for a 10-min extension. 3'BL-ligated reactions were run using the same program without the initial 3 min extension at 72°C. PCR reactions using either prA (ON30) or both prA and prB (ON31) were purified using AMPure XP beads. Purified products were quantified using the Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Invitrogen).3. Results3.1. 3' Branch ligation: a novel method to ligate non-complementary DNA endsConventionally, DNA ligation involves the joining of the 5'PO4 and 3'OH DNA ends of cohesive or blunt-ended fragments. Cohesive-end ligation is generally faster and less dependent on enzyme concentration compared with blunt-end joining. Both processes can be catalysed by bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, which uses ATP as an energy-yielding cofactor and requires Mg2+.8 T4 DNA ligase was also reported to ligate specific or degenerate single-stranded oligos to partially single-stranded substrates through hybridization.17,18 Here, we demonstrated a non-conventional T4 DNA ligase-mediated ligation that does not require complimentary base pairing and can ligate a blunt-end DNA donor to the 3'OH end of a duplex DNA acceptor at 3'-recessed strands, gaps, or nicks (Fig. 1a). Therefore, we use the term 3'-branch ligation (3'BL) to describe these ligations. The synthetic donor DNA we used contained a 5' blunt duplex end and a 3' ssDNA end. The acceptor substrates contained one of the following structures: a dephosphorylated nick, a 1- or 8-nt gap, or a 3' 36-nt 3'-recessed end (Supplementary Table S1). T4 ligase helps to join the 5'PO4 of the donor strand to the sole ligatable 3'OH of the acceptor strand to form a branch-shaped ligation product.To optimize the ligation efficiency, we extensively tested a number of factors that affect general ligation efficiency, including the adapter: DNA substrate ratio, T4 ligase quantity, final ATP concentration, Mg2+ concentration, pH, incubation time, and different additives, such as polyethyleneglycol-8000 (PEG-8000) and single-stranded binding protein (SSB) (Supplementary Fig. S2, data not shown). Adding PEG-8000 to a final concentration of 10% substantially increased the ligation efficiency by 2- to 10-fold (Supplementary Fig. S1). A large range of ATP concentrations (from 1 µM to 1 mM in Supplementary Fig. S2a) and Mg2+ concentrations (3–10 mM, data not shown) were compatible with the 3'BL. The ligase quantity needed for 3'BL was comparable with that for blunt-end ligation. In our optimized conditions, we used donor: substrate DNA molar ratios of 30–100, and we performed the reactions at 37°C for 1 h at pH 7.8 with 1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 10% PEG-8000. The ligation of the same donors to blunt-end substrates and ligase-free reactions were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The ligation donor (Ad-G) is double-stranded on one end (5' phosphorylated and 3' dideoxy protected) and single-stranded (3' dideoxy protected) on the other end (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table S1). The ligation substrates are composed of the same bottom strand (ON1) with different top strands to compose nick, gap, and overhang structures. To quantify ligation product yields, the reaction products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1b). Ligation efficiency was calculated as the ratio of product to substrate intensity using ImageJ (Fig. 1b and c). The experiments were repeated multiple times with very similar ligation efficiency (data not shown). The 3'-recessive ligation (lane 11 in Fig. 1b) appeared ~90% complete, which is even higher than the blunt-end ligation control (lane 14, 72.74%) and suggests remarkably high ligation efficiency with 3'-recessive DNA ends. The 1- or 8-nt gap substrates (lanes 5 and 8) showed good ligation efficiency of ~45%. Nick ligation (lane 2) efficiency was the lowest at ~13%. However, this ligation yield was improved when the nick ligation reaction was incubated longer (data not shown), suggesting slower kinetics for the nick ligation reaction.We also extended our study to different adapter and substrate sequences using the optimized reaction condition (Fig. 2). The 5'PO4 ends of three different adapters (Ad-T, Ad-A, or Ad-GA in Supplementary Table S1) contained either a single T or A or the dinucleotide GA at the ligation junction before a consensus CTGCTGA sequence. These 5'PO4 ends were individually ligated to the 3'OH ends of acceptor templates with a T at the ligation junction. Overall, high ligation efficiency (70–90%) was seen in most cases except for nick ligations or 3'BL using Ad-GA (Fig. 2f), thus indicating some nucleotide preference of T4 DNA ligase at the ligation junctions. Independent of the adapter and substrate sequences, the 3'-recessive end or gap ligations always showed better efficiencies (60–90%), whereas the nick ligation was fairly inefficient, in a 1-h incubation. We hypothesize that these discrepancies in ligation efficiency are due to the DNA bending where the nick/gap/overhang starts and exposes the 3'OH group for ligation. The longer ssDNA region likely makes the 3' termini more accessible in the ligation and results in higher ligation efficiency. We also tested whether a similar end-joining event could occur as 5' branch ligation. In contrast to 3'BL, no obvious ligation of a blunt-end adapter to the 5'PO4 end at the gap or the 5'-recessive end was observed (data not shown). This result suggests greater steric hindrance of T4 DNA ligase at the donor’s 5' termini compared with 3' termini.3.2. 3' Branch ligation to ligate DNA to RNAWe further investigated 3'BL on DNA/RNA hybrids (ON-21/ON-23 in Supplementary Table S1) that form one DNA and one RNA 3'-recessive end (Fig. 3a). Ligation on DNA/DNA hybrids served as a positive control, whereas negative ligation controls included DNA/RNA hybrids, ssDNA, or ssRNA oligos incubated individually or with adapters (lanes 3, 4, and 5 in Fig. 3c and data not shown). Interestingly, when DNA/RNA hybrids were incubated with a blunt-end dsDNA donor, we observed a size change of the RNA oligo from the original 29–49 nt upon ligation. However, the DNA substrate remained unchanged (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3c). This result suggests that the blunt-end dsDNA donor ligated to the 3'-end of RNA but not to the 3'-end of DNA. As a positive control, DNA/DNA hybrids with 3'-recessive ends on each side showed band shifts to larger species on both strands with nearly 100% efficiency (data not shown). To confirm that the 3'-recessive structure was needed for 3'BL, we performed the same ligation reaction while replacing the original DNA oligo (ON-21) with another long DNA template (ON-23) that is not complimentary to ON-22 RNA (Fig. 3b). Unsurprisingly, no ligation was observed using the ON-23 DNA template (lanes 10–13 in Fig. 3c). Our finding indicates that T4 DNA ligase can promote 3'BL on DNA/RNA hybrids in our optimal conditions and that this activity has certain steric substrate preferences that may be affected by differences in T4 DNA ligase–substrate binding affinities.3' Branch ligation at the 3' end of RNA in DNA/RNA hybrid.

In both tests, T4 RNA ligase 1 and T4 RNA ligase 2 slightly ligated the blunt end adapters to the 3' end of RNA in a DNA/RNA hybrid. Notably, in the RNA-only controls, T4 RNA ligase 2 could join a blunt-end dsDNA adapter to ssRNA. In conclusion, T4 DNA ligase, but not T4 RNA ligases, is competent to efficiently ligate blunt-end dsDNA to the 3' end of RNA through 3'BL.3.3. Directional tagmentation library constructionBecause 3'BL is useful for ligating adapters to several genomic structures with high efficiency, we explored its application in NGS workflows. Transposon-based library construction is rapid and consumes less input DNA compared with conventional NGS library preparation. However, using commercial transposon-based library preparation systems, only half of tagged molecules are flanked by two different adapter sequences (Fig. 4a), and tagged DNA is flanked by self-complementary regions that could form stable hairpin structures and compromise sequencing quality.19 In addition, the PCR-mediated incorporation of adapter sequences has not been adapted for whole-genome sequencing or PCR-free NGS library construction.(a–c) Schematic representation of three transposon tagmentation methods followed by PCR amplification using Pr-A (blue arrow) and Pr-B (green arrow). Two-transposon method (a); one Y transposon tagmentation with 3'-gap filling (b); one-transposon method with adapter ligation at 3'-gap (c).

(d) Graph of amplification signal after purification using pr-A or pr-A with pr-B after the various tagmentation and gap ligation conditions.To overcome these limitations, we developed a new protocol for transposon-based NGS library construction by incorporating 3'BL. Both Tn5 and MuA transposons work through a ‘cut and paste’ mechanism, in which a transposon adapter sequence is end-joined to the 5'-end of target DNA to create a 9 or 5-bp gap, respectively, at the 3'-end of the genomic DNA (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, 3'BL can be used to add another adapter sequence to the 3'-end of genomic DNA at the gap to complete the directional adapter ligation (Fig. 4c). We used Tn5 transposons in this manuscript to compare the efficiency of the single-tagmentation + 3'BL approach (Fig. 4c) to that of a double-tagmentation approach, which uses the two different Tn5-based adapters TnA and TnB (Fig. 4a), and to that of another directional single-tagmentation strategy using Y adapters that contain two different adapter sequences (Fig. 4b). Human genomic DNA was incubated with equimolar amounts of TnA and TnB transposome complexes, with the TnA transposome complex alone, or with the TnY (TnA/B) transposome complex. The product of TnA transposome-only fragmentation was further used as a template for 3'BL with the blunt-end adapter AdB, which shares a common adapter sequence with TnB. PCR amplification was performed using two primers, Pr-A and Pr-B, designed to recognize the TnA and AdB/TnB adapters, respectively. The quantification data suggested that TnA&AdB had the highest efficiency compared with TnA&TnB and TnY (TnA/B) (Fig. 4d). No significant amplification was observed when only one primer specific to TnA adapter was used (Fig. 4d). As expected due to PCR suppression, the TnA 3'BL approach, the double-tagmentation approach, and the TnY approach all showed significantly higher PCR efficiency than the tagmentation reaction with only the TnA or TnB transposome complex alone (Fig. 4d).We also sequenced these libraries using BGI’s DNA nanoball-based sequencing platform and compared the base-positional bias among the transposon-interfered end, the 3'BL end, and the regular TA ligation end (Fig. 5). It is obvious that the positional bias at the 3'BL end is less than that at the Tn5 end (Fig. 5a and b), which occurs because the 3'BL end is influenced by both transposon interruption and 3'BL. Because only the first 6 nt (positions 1–6) of the 3'BL end showed base bias and the bias was similar to but not exactly the same as that of its hybridized Tn5 end (positions 30–35, after the 9-nt overhang), we conclude that the positional bias we observed at the 3'BL end is mainly caused by the Tn5 transposon. Therefore, 3'BL causes minimal bias and is similar to regular TA ligation (Fig. 5c).Base distribution bias of Tn5-gap ligation (a), two transposons (b), and regular TA ligation (c).

DiscussionOne important property of T4 DNA ligase is its efficient joining of blunt-end dsDNA,20,21 which has not been observed with other DNA ligases. This ligase was also reported to mediate some unusual catalytic events, such as ligating single-strand gaps or mismatched bases in duplex DNA,10,11 forming a stem-loop molecule from partially double-stranded DNA,12 or inefficiently ligating ssDNA in a template-independent manner.14Here, we demonstrated that T4 DNA ligase catalysed the joining of blunt-end dsDNA to the 3'OH end of dsDNA with a nick and the joining of partially single-strand duplex DNA with a gap or 3'-recessed end. In contrast, no ligation to the 5'PO4 end at the 5'-recessed ends or in the gaps was observed (data not shown). This indicates that after binding to the 5'PO4 end of the dsDNA adapter, T4 DNA ligase can access the recessed 3' end in the target DNA when DNA bends and exposes the 3'OH end. Unlike the mismatched or gapped ligation in previous reports,10–13 no base pairing of the donor DNA to the acceptor DNA was required with our 3'BL method. Moreover, even for a 1-nt gap, greater than 70% completion was accomplished using optimized conditions, while other template-independent ligation was of very low yield and was only detected by qPCR measurement.14However, different 3'BL ligation efficiencies were observed for ligating 5' T, A, or GA to 3' T (Fig. 2), which indicates some sequence preference at the ligation junction. Despite the recognized ligation bias,22 T4 DNA ligase is commonly used in the adapter addition step during NGS library preparation. With its ability to perform 3'BL, T4 ligase can ligate adapters to several genomic structures that were previously considered unligatable, resulting in a higher template usage rate. For example, 3'BL can be coupled with single transposon tagmentation. The traditional double-transposon strategy has only 50% of the tagmented molecules that are amenable for the following amplification step. However, when DNA tagmentation is performed using one transposon with subsequent 3'BL, an increased yield of molecules with different adapters on each insert end can be acquired (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the tagmented 3'BL products can be directly loaded on Illumina’s flow cell as PCR free WGS libraries, which was difficult to achieve using double-transposon strategy. Other directional transposon protocols have been proposed using a Y transposon composed of two different adapter sequences23 or replacing the unlinked strand from a single transposon with a second adapter oligo followed by gap filling and ligation.24,25 However, these approaches continue to preserve the inverted adapter sequences and/or cannot insert sample barcodes adjacent to genomic DNA as the tagmented 3'BL protocol can. We performed a proof-of-concept study of a new directional tagmentation protocol for NGS library construction that eliminates inverted adapters and allows sample barcode insertion adjacent to genomic DNA. 3'BL after single transposon tagmentation can theoretically achieve 100% usable template, and our empirical data demonstrate that the new approach produced higher yield compared with traditional double transposon or Y transposon tagmentation. There are several explanations that the actual efficiency in Fig. 4d did not achieve 100%: The products of TnA&TnB contained not only the correct PCR products from Primer A and B, but also the incorrect ones from single primer A or B (blue bars from Fig. 4d). Therefore, the process efficiency increase might be underestimated, if we directly compare the PCR yield of TnA&TnB to that of TnA&AdB. On top of that, The AdB used in this test was not the adapters (Ad-T or Ad-A) with highest ligation efficiency, because we had to match the sequences from TnA/TnB and TnY for direct comparison. Wang et al. later changed the adapter sequence to achieve better process efficiency and described it in their stLFR paper. Based on NGS data, the 3'BL ligated genomic ends also demonstrated fewer positions with positional base composition bias, and the first 6-nt bias was mild and mainly caused by transposon insertion, suggesting that 3'BL has minimal positional bias. Using this new library construction method, Wang et al. successfully achieved highly accurate and complete variant calling in WGS and near-perfect phasing of variants into long contigs with N50 size up to 23.4 mb for long fragment reading (BioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/324392). 3'BL was also incorporated in a novel mate-pair NGS library workflow to effectively cut down the laboratory steps and costs by Dong et al. (BioRxiv, http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/400689).In this study, we also investigated 3'BL using templates of a chimeric DNA/RNA duplex that forms a 5' DNA and a 5' RNA overhang (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, blunt-ended dsDNA was efficiently ligated to the 3' termini of RNA, but not DNA, suggesting that T4 ligase has a ternary complex formation preference. The ligation efficiency was greatly reduced if T4 RNA ligase I or II was used to join the ends. Some preliminary yet important applications of 3'BL with T4 DNA ligase are 3' end labelling of RNA, the enrichment of mRNA or the construction of targeted RNA libraries, especially for miRNAs, the small regulatory RNAs whose uncontrolled expression leads to a number of diseases.26,27 Thus, our 3'BL technique can be readily applied to the detection of cancer or Alzheimer’s disease by monitoring targeted miRNA. Hybridization with DNA probes targeting the Poly(A) tail or specific miRNA sequences can be used to create DNA-RNA hybrids with a RNA 3'-recessive end, which is followed by ligation of RNA to adapter sequences with sample and/or UID barcodes through 3'BL. These common sequences can then be reverse transcribed to produce the cDNA of targeted RNA sequences. Compared with current miRNA capture technologies, the use of 3'BL mediated by T4 DNA ligase could potentially provide several advantages for NGS RNA library construction. First, hybridization with a DNA strand would prevent secondary structure formation by the RNA strand and therefore mitigate the bias introduced by other protocols. Second, T4 DNA ligase enables high-efficiency adapter addition through 3'BL, which avoids intramolecular RNA interactions that can be promoted by RNA ligases. Third, adapter dimers can be effectively eliminated, possibly rendering undesirable gel purification unnecessary. This new method could lead to improved unbiased microRNA expression profiling with simple and scalable workflows, and thus, large-scale research studies would become more affordable.The findings of this study add to the growing understanding of T4 DNA ligase activities. We envision 3' branch ligation becoming a general tool in molecular biology that will advance the development of new nucleic acid engineering methods beyond described NGS applications.We would like to acknowledge the ongoing contributions and support of all Complete Genomics and BGI-Shenzhen employees, especially Benjamin Allred for commenting the manuscript.This work was supported by Shenzhen Peacock Plan (No. KQTD20150330171505310).Employees of BGI and Complete Genomics have stock holdings in BGI.Supplementary data"

IntroductionRNA-Seq has revolutionized transcriptome analysis. Without detailed information for each of the transcripts, that is, comprehensive information on the transcripts, the transcriptome information can be obtained by massively parallel sequencing of mRNA fragments.1 Indeed, there are numerous successful examples of the application of RNA-Seq for measuring gene expression levels and detecting splicing variants and mutations in transcripts.2,3 However, there is a large flaw in this method: it requires prior fragmentation of the mRNA molecules. When the entire transcript structure of a given transcript is studied, the fragmented sequence reads should be computationally assembled to form an ‘isoform’.4 However, precise isoform information is not always represented in the assembled transcripts. If repetitive sequences are included in its internal sequence or its expression level is low, providing an insufficient number of sequence tags, the obtained results are occasionally unreliable without further validation analyses. Moreover, it is essentially impossible to analyse the relationship between multiple sites of splicing, if any.Recently, to overcome the limitations of the current short-read sequencing approach, several new long-read technologies have been developed, such as RSII and Sequel of Pacific Biosciences, MinION of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and the linked-read method of 10X Genomics.5 In several aspects of genomic studies, long-read sequencing has appeared to have particular advantages. Namely, while it is occasionally difficult to align short reads uniquely to repetitive and duplicated regions, long reads can be effectively aligned even to these regions. Taking advantage of this feature, complementary use of long-read sequencing data analyses have now become authentic methods when de novo genome assembly or analysis of structural variations is contemplated. Since the long reads occasionally cover multiple SNPs in a single sequence, the mutual relationship of SNPs can also be obtained as ‘phasing information’.6For the transcriptome study, PacBio RSII has been used for long-read sequencing of transcripts. In the ‘Iso-Seq’ method, the mRNAs are subjected to cDNA synthesis and amplification by the template-switching method.7 From the sequence data obtained from PacBio RSII, it is possible to determine the entire structure of the transcripts. However, in this protocol, extensive prior size fractionation is necessary, perhaps because of the bias of the sequencer toward reading shorter fragments.8 The procedure, including the sequencing reaction itself, is sometimes technically difficult and cannot be performed in a small laboratory. More importantly, current or provisioned sequencing throughput is inadequate to obtain sufficient numbers of sequences to extract the gene expression information.9The MinION sequencer is a newly developed portable long-read sequencer. After several rounds of updates, its sequence accuracy has now exceeded 90%, and the expected number of reads per flow cell is over hundreds of thousands per flow cell.10 The read length has also been improved, having achieved a N50 read length of more than 100 kb.11 Pioneering work on the application of MinION to RNA-Seq using R7.3 MinION flow cell and single-cell RNA-Seq using R7.3 and 9.4 flow cells has been reported.12,13 However, in these study, the number of mapped reads was limited to only ~100,000. Throughput of MinION is growing by improvement of squenecing chemistry and software, and further evaluation is needed.In this study, we evaluated and optimized the RNA-Seq procedure using the MinION sequencer and applied the update procedure for transcriptome analyses for various purposes. First, we used seven lung cancer cell lines and MinION R9, R9.4, and R9.5 for developing the experimental and computational procedure. We employed LAST for mapping MinION reads to RefSeq transcripts or directly to the human genome. We demonstrate that reasonably accurate information on gene expression levels as well as unique information on the entire transcript structure, including the transcript products of fusion genes in cancers, can be obtained using this approach. We also successfully attempted phasing of SNP, which were identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS), using a series of RNA materials obtained from representative organs of particular male and female individuals.2. Materials and methods2.1. Total RNA and DNATotal RNA purified from seven lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC-7, PC-9, H1975, H2228, VMRC-LCD, LC2/ad, and A549) were used. We purchased 14 total RNAs from seven organs, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, colon, heart, and lung, derived from two individuals (BioChain Institute). We also purchased two genomic DNAs derived from them. We conducted a quality check of the total RNA using the Agilent RNA Nano Kit.2.2. FL-cDNA synthesis and amplificationTotal RNA (50 ng) was used for FL-cDNA synthesis and amplification. We employed the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara Bio), except for the template switching oligo, poly-dT primer, and PCR primer. We used custom oligos with the same sequences as Smart-Seq2, instead of them.14 The synthesized first-strand cDNA was amplified by 16 cycles of PCR. FL-cDNA was quantified using the Agilent DNA 7500 Kit (Agilent Technologies).2.3. FL-cDNA preparation from a single cellLC2ad were dissociated to single cells by Accumax treatment (Innovative Cell Technologies). We employed the C1 single-cell auto prep system (Fluidigm) and SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit with oligo DNA, identically to Smart-Seq2. We executed the C1 protocol ‘SMART-Seq v4 Rev B’. We acquired approximately 1 ng of FL-cDNA. As a control, we also conducted cDNA synthesis from bulk cells using a general thermal cycler with the same reaction conditions. Using SeqAmp DNA Polymerase (TAKARA Bio), we conducted a further amplification (1 cycle of 1 min at 96 °C, 5 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 65 °C for 30 s, 7 min at 68 °C, 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C). We purified the re-amplified cDNA using Agencourt AMPureXP (Beckman Coulter). Approximately 300 ng of FL-cDNA was obtained.2.4. MinION sequencing of FL-cDNAFor 2D sequencing of FL-cDNA generated from total RNA, 1 µg of FL-cDNA was applied for library preparation of MinION with the protocol ‘2D genomic DNA by ligation’ and the Sequencing kit (SQK_MAP007), and the R9 flow cell (FLO-MAP104 or FLO-MIN105) or Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK208), and the R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106). R9 flow cells were used for FL-cDNA-Seq of PC-7, PC-9, H1975, H2228, and VMRC-LCD. Both R9 and R9.4 flow cells were used for FL-cDNA-Seq of LC2ad. For 1D2 sequencing of FL-cDNA, 1 µg of FL-cDNA of A549 was applied for library preparation of MinION using the protocol ‘1D°2 sequencing of genomic DNA’ with some modifications with the 1D2 sequencing kit (SQK-LSK308) and R9.5 flow cell (FLO-MIN107). For the purification steps after ligation of the 1D2 adapter and Barcode Adapter Mix, the same volume of AMPure XP beads was added to the sample, instead of adding 40% of its volume. For single cell samples, 300 ng of re-amplified FL-cDNA was applied using the protocol ‘Native barcoding genomic DNA’ with the Native Barcoding Kit (EXP-NBD002), Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK208), and R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106). We conducted multiplex sequencing of 11 samples.For direct RNA-Seq, we performed direct RNA-Seq of LC2/ad using the R9.5 flow cell, Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA001), and 500 ng polyA-selected RNA of LC2/ad, following the manufacturer’s instructions.2.5. Data analysis of MinION readsWe aligned the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of LC2/ad sequenced by R9.4 flow cells to all RefSeq transcripts of mRNA (NM) and ncRNA (NR) or the longest coding isoforms of each RefGene. BWA-MEM version 0.7.15 had the following parameters: ‘-x ont2d’. We also aligned the MinION reads to these references by lastal and last-split of LAST version 833 with the parameter tuned by last train. To calculate the coverage and identity, we used the MinION reads aligned to all RefSeq transcripts. Coverage was defined as the fraction of RefSeq transcript length covered by the single read. Identity was defined as the percentage of matched bases to the sum of matched bases, substitutions, insertions, and deletions. For gene expression estimation, we used all the MinION reads aligned to the longest coding isoforms of each RefGene. The number of reads mapped to each isoform was counted. We calculated the rpm (reads per million) value for each gene as the expression unit. MinION reads were also aligned to the hg38 analysis set by LAST with the parameter of lastal tuned by last-train and ‘-d90 -m50 -D10’ and last-split ‘-m1 -d2’.For splice isoform detection, we used the alignments of all pass 2d reads of LC2/ad (R9.4) to the reference genome by LAST. To remove pseudogene mapping, low-quality reads and alignment results, we discarded the aligned reads with any of the following five conditions. (1) Reads did not have an intron, which was defined as a gap of more than 50 bp. (2) Strand score of LAST was zero. (3) Unmapped length of reads within splice junctions was more than 10 bp. (4) Reads overlapped with pseudogenes of Genocode v27. (5) Isoforms with the same exon–intron structures existed on the reverse strand. Junctions of the remaining reads compared with RefSeq transcripts allowed a gap within 20 bp. If the corresponding RefSeq transcripts did not exist and the isoform was covered by more than ten reads, we judged the read to be derived from a novel isoform.For detection of fusion transcript, we mapped all pass 2d reads to the reference genome by Blat with the following parameter: ‘-noHead -mask=lower’.5,15We extracted reads with multiple alignments to multiple chromosomes, different strands of the same chromosome, or more than 1 Mb away from the same chromosome without an alternative alignment within 1 Mb of the same chromosome strand. If both ends of the reads were aligned with exons of RefSeq transcripts, we judged it as a fusion candidate.For hetero SNP phasing of lung cancer cells, we used all pass 2d reads aligned to the genome by LAST and the hetero SNP data from our previous study.16 We selected reads with possible patterns of multiple SNP according to hetero SNPs and counted the number of reads with each SNP pattern. For each gene, we selected two major SNP patterns that did not mutually contradict one another, and were covered by more than five reads, respectively.To detect differential allelic expression of two individuals, we used all 2d reads aligned to the genome by LAST and the hetero SNP data from this study (see also Supplementary Methods).17 First, we used all tissue-merged reads of each individual. We called the two major patterns of single or multiple SNPs from these reads as performed for the lung cancer cell line data. We counted the number of reads in each organ according to each phased pattern. To detect genes with significant differential allelic expression, we employed the binomial test.3. Results and discussion3.1. Optimization of the cDNA-Seq procedureUsing the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit from Takara Bio, which is based on the Smart-Seq2 method, we synthesized full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) from 50 ng total RNA isolated from seven lung adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines: PC-7, PC-9, H1975, H2228, VMRC-LCD, LC2/ad, and A549 (Fig. 1A).14 In these cell lines, we have previously performed RNA-Seq and WGS.16 By cDNA amplification via 16 cycles of PCR, we obtained 5–9 µg of double-stranded FL-cDNA, starting from 50 nanograms of total RNA. Although we also conducted cDNA preparation by Smart-Seq2, the yield of FL-cDNA was lower than that of SMART-Seq v4 (data not shown). We used 1 µg of FL-cDNA for library preparation of the MinION sequencing. We conducted one or two runs of 2D sequencing for approximately each six cell lines except for A549 by R9 flow cells (Supplementary Table S1). We used four R9.4 flow cells for 2D sequencing of LC2/ad. Averages of all runs using the R9 and R9.4 flow cells were 161,325 and 302,059 reads of total reads and 42,761 and 180,938 reads of pass 2d reads, respectively. We used only pass 2d reads, which had a higher quality in the following analyses. As a result, we obtained 723,750 reads of pass 2d from four runs of LC2/ad by R9.4 flow cells in total. We also conducted a single run of 1D2 sequencing for A549 and obtained 994,111 1d reads and 931 pass 1dsq reads (Supplementary Table S2). Statistics for the FL-cDNA-Seq analysis of the other cell lines are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For the following analyses, we mainly focused on the data obtained from LC2/ad but obtained essentially similar results from the other cell lines. MinION sequencing of full-length cDNA.

The average coverage or identity and percentages of reads with a coverage or identity greater than 0.8 is shown on the graphs. The coverage was defined as the ratio of the length of the RefSeq transcript covered by a single MinION read.First, we compared the results of LC2/ad between R9 and R9.4. The read lengths of R9 and R9.4 were distributed similarly to the average read lengths of 908 and 917 bp, respectively (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). The average read length of the other cell lines, which were sequenced by R9, was also approximately 1 kb long (Supplementary Table S1). We also compared the distributions of read length with the electropherogram of the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Fig. 1B). We found that the distributions mostly overlapped, except for short fragments. These results might indicate that base calling of short fragment is unfavorable for the base caller of MinION. These results collectively suggested that transcriptome information can be read on the MinION sequencer without imposing serious length bias.3.2. The analytical pipelineTo associate the obtained sequences to the reference genes or transcripts, we constructed a computational pipeline. Currently, most alignment programs are optimized for short and accurate reads, assuming the process of Illumina reads. We examined and found that these programs, as they are, are not suited for mapping the longer and less-accurate MinION reads.First, to select an appropriate mapping software for this purpose, the pass 2d reads of LC2ad sequenced by R9.4 were aligned to the RefSeq transcripts by LAST and BWA.18–20 For LAST, we employed the parameters tuned by LAST-TRAIN and aligned using last-al and -split. For BWA, we used the parameter optimized for pass 2d reads of MinION (-x ont2d option) and aligned them using BWA-MEM.20 The 532,956 reads (74%) and 690,528 reads (95%) were first aligned to the RefSeq transcripts using both LAST and BWA (Supplementary Table S3). We evaluated the obtained data regarding their coverages as the RefSeq coverage (the fraction of RefSeq transcript length covered by a single read). For LAST and BWA, the average coverage was 38.3% and 33.9% of the mapped reads, respectively, showing a RefSeq coverage of more than 0.80 (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that LAST could align the greater part of the read sequence to the RefSeq transcript, although the mapping rate of BWA was higher than LAST. Concomitantly, it is suggested that many of the transcripts were sequenced in their full-length forms. Based on these results, we decided to employ LAST as a default alignment software in the following analyses. When considering such alignment results, it is important to bear in mind that we can trivially obtain more and/or longer alignments, by using less-stringent alignment criteria.3.3. The overall sequence accuracyBased on the obtained sequence alignments, we evaluated the sequence accuracy (Fig. 1D). We found that the pass 2d reads obtained an overall accuracy of 92.3%. The mismatches consisted of 12.4%, 14.2%, and 73.4% base substitutions and insertions and deletions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). We examined the base substitution pattern and found that (G to A) substitutions were the most frequent (29.4%), although the preference was not substantial. We further compared the accuracy and RefSeq coverage between the 2d of 2 D sequencing, 1d and pass 1dsq reads of recent 1D2 sequencing (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S3). Although the pass 1dsq reads (95.1%) were the most accurate compared with pass 2d reads (92.3%) and 1d reads (87.2%), there was no significant difference in the RefSeq coverage between them. However, the rate of pass 1dsq reads was quite low on this sequencing run (0.1%). In a typical run of FL-cDNA-Seq by 1D2 sequencing, the rate of pass 1dsq reads was 0.4-0.9% (data not shown).3.4. Gene expression informationTo evaluate the precise representation of the transcriptome in MinION reads, we compared the gene expression levels in LC2/ad between those measured by the MinION reads and by the conventional Illumina TruSeq RNA method, which had been read by HiSeq2500 in our previous study.16 To minimize the influence of multi-mapped reads and differences in alignment software, both reads were aligned to the longest RefSeq transcripts of each gene by LAST (Supplementary Table S3). We calculated the rpm (reads per million) and tpm (transcripts per million) as the gene expression unit for the MinION and Illumina data sets. A high correlation coefficient (R = 0.88) was observed between them (also see Supplementary Fig. S4, showing that similar results were also obtained for the BWA-processed data; R = 0.88). To further examine the influence of the mRNA fragmentation process, which is unique to TruSeq of Illumina, we used the same cDNA amplicons that were used for MinION sequencing and prepared an Illumina library by using the SMART-Seq v4 and the Nextera XT kits, referred to as SMART-Seq (Supplementary Table S4 and see also Supplementary Methods). The comparison revealed a higher correlation (R = 0.91), suggesting that an influence of the difference in template preparation procedure could partly explain the difference in the represented expression information (Fig. 2A). To further validate the influence regarding the generally smaller numbers of MinION reads (‘shallow sequencing depth’), we randomly sampled the reads of FL-cDNA-Seq and SMART-Seq and calculated the correlation efficiencies and number of detected genes as >1 rpm or tpm. On MinION, the correlation efficiency with TruSeq roughly reached a plateau at a sequencing depth of 40,000 reads, although the number of detected genes continued to increase thereafter (Fig. 2B). We also performed a similar comparison with SMART-Seq. SMART-Seq showed almost the same trend as FL-cDNA-Seq. Comparison of FL-cDNA-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq. (A) The gene expression of FL-cDNA-Seq of LC2/ad (R9.4) was compared with that of TruSeq RNA (left) and SMART-Seq (right). Pearson correlation coefficients are shown on the graph. (B) Influence of sequencing depth on the estimation of gene expression level and gene detection. Reads for each method were randomly sampled in triplicate.

Pearson correlation coefficients are shown on the graph. qRT-qPCR data of LC2/ad was obtained as in our previous study.16Then, we validated the gene expression levels of 44 genes by RT-qPCR.16 We compared the obtained results with FL-cDNA-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq methods. Although the number of FL-cDNA-Seq reads was generally smaller than that of Illumina reads, the FL-cDNA-Seq data showed a comparably high correlation efficiency with the RT-qPCR data [R = 0.82 (TruSeq), 0.81 (SMART-Seq), and 0.82 (FL-cDNA-Seq), respectively] (Fig. 2C). Taken together, we concluded that FL-cDNA-Seq is effective for the purposes of quantitative transcriptome analysis.3.5. Comparison with direct RNA sequencingWe also conducted recent direct RNA-Seq of LC2/ad21 (Supplementary Table S5). We obtained 556,195 1d reads from a single run. The average length of the direct RNA-Seq reads was 926 bp, which was comparable to the average length of the above RNA-Seq. Similarly, the direct RNA-Seq reads were aligned to all RefSeq transcripts using LAST. The direct RNA-Seq reads showed comparable coverage (57.0%) of the reference transcripts to FL-cDNA-Seq (58.4%) (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Furthermore, the direct RNA-Seq showed a high correlation (R = 0.92 and 0.90) with TruSeq and the FL-cDNA-Seq, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5B). In contrast, direct RNA-Seq showed lower fidelity (83.2%) than FL-cDNA-Seq (92.3%) (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Based on these results, we conclude that direct RNA-Seq is also useful to estimate expression levels of the whole transcriptome. An obvious advantage of direct RNA-Seq is that it is free from PCR bias and may be able to analyse mRNA for which reverse transcription is not efficient. However, there is a limitation to this method, which is that 500 ng of polyA RNA is required as starting material, which may limit its application to rare samples, such as the subtle amounts of RNA present in some clinical samples.3.6. Applications of MinION transcriptome sequencingIn addition to the above applications, we found that FL-cDNA-Seq may have several applications that are not easily performed using Illumina RNA-Seq.We examined whether the FL-cDNA-Seq reads could be used to detect transcript variants and mutations. For this purpose, the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of LC2/ad (R9.4) were aligned to the reference genome by LAST. We calculated the distance between the detected and RefSeq transcript TSS (transcription start site) and TTS (transcription termination site), and 82% and 63% of the TSS and TTS detected by MinION were located within ±500 bp from those of the RefSeq transcripts, respectively (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). We compared the detected transcripts with transcript models of RefSeq. Although 6,018 of the detected transcripts matched the RefSeq models, 158 of them represented unannotated isoforms (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). We also compared the detected transcripts by FL-cDNA-Seq and RNA-Seq. Although only 33 (21%) of the novel isoforms detected by FL-cDNA-Seq were detected by cufflinks with guide of RefSeq annotation from the RNA-Seq data, all the splice junctions of 137 (87%) of them were covered by the RNA-Seq reads (Table 1). Examples are novel isoforms of STARP and ACTG1 genes that were difficult to detect by Illumina reads alone (Fig. 3A).

The phased SNP pattern and number of reads covering all the SNPs are shown at the bottom.We further attempted to detect fusion transcripts in cancer cells. We aligned the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of six cell lines to the reference genome using BLAT (Supplementary Table S7). The transcripts with two or more alignments that were mapped to different chromosomes, or those that were mapped to regions that were mutually separated by more than 1 Mb, were considered. A total 151 fusion transcript candidates were detected from the LC2/ad reads of R9.4 (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S8). The detected fusion transcripts included the previously reported cancer driver fusion transcript of the CCDC6-RET gene. As shown in Fig. 3B, seven reads directly represented the junction of the CCDC6-RET fusion transcript. Interestingly, the fusion point harbored a hetero germline SNP, which gave us a clue regarding the identities of the alleles in which the fusion event occurred. Considering all six cell lines together, we identified 194 fusion gene candidates (Table 2). For example, WAC-SFMBT2 and ZSCAN22-CHMP2A fusion transcripts were detected from LC2/ad and PC-9, respectively (Fig. 3B). These genes could be validated using Sanger sequencing (Fig. 3C and see also Supplementary Methods). These results indicate that MinION sequencing is a convenient method to detect fusion gene transcripts. Application of MinION transcriptome sequencing: number of fusion gene candidatesApplication of MinION transcriptome sequencing: number of fusion gene candidatesIn lung cancer, there are well-known driver mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene, which are targets for molecular target drugs such as gefitinib. There are also several secondary mutations known for resistance to drugs in the proximal region.22 For those mutations, it is important to obtain phase information (allele context of the mutations) since the clinical relevance will be distinct regardless of whether the mutations are located on the same allele. We expected long MinION reads to overcome the difficulties in phasing using Illumina reads. To avoid false detection due to the relatively high error rates of MinION, we employed the heterozygous SNV information for lung cancer cell lines previously detected from WGS using Illumina HiSeq.16 Considering all the cell lines together, multiple SNVs were phased on 291 genes (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S9). Interestingly, the mutual distance between those SNVs was occasionally greater than 100 kb because of the intron between them. This approach may enable rather efficient SNP phasing than that at the genomic level as far as the location in transcript regions (Fig. 3D). Application of MinION transcriptome sequencing: phased gene number and heterozygous site distanceApplication of MinION transcriptome sequencing: phased gene number and heterozygous site distanceBy using FL-cDNA-Seq, we attempted to detect allele-biased expression in various organs of given individuals. We obtained a total of 14 total RNA sets from seven organs of two healthy individuals, one male and one female. We also obtained their corresponding genomic DNAs. We performed FL-cDNA-Seq for these 14 RNA samples and aligned the reads to the human reference genome by LAST (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11). We also performed whole exome sequencing of two genomic DNA samples by Illumina (Supplementary Table S12 and see also Supplementary Methods). Using GATK best practices, 437,646 and 395,486 hetero SNPs were called from the genomic DNAs of the male and the female samples, respectively. Using the obtained hetero SNP data, we phased the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of all tissue-merged data. We phased 2,928 genes, and 306 genes showed significant allelic expression based on the binomial test (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S13). For instance, the UBXN4 gene was showed differential allelic expression in the female. Although the C allele showed higher expression than the A allele in most tissues of the female, only the liver showed the opposite allelic expression pattern (Fig. 4A). In the male, we also detected the GNAS gene, which has a known complex allelic imbalance expression pattern23,24 (Fig. 4B). This gene has one maternal chromosome-specific first exon, two paternal chromosome-specific first exons, and neutral first exons. Paternal first exons and the maternal first exon were only detected on the C allele and T allele, showing that the C and T alleles are on the paternal chromosome and maternal chromosome, respectively.

To obtain sufficient amounts of input template for FL-cDNA-Seq, five additional cycles of PCR were employed. Approximately 250–450 ng of cDNA templates were obtained from each of the single cells and subjected to FL-cDNA-Seq. The libraries obtained from one bulk and one doublet cell, as well as nine single cells, were barcoded and loaded onto a single R9.4 flow cell. A total of 24,817 reads (469–6,522 per samples) were obtained (Supplementary Table S14). For comparison, we also conducted Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT-processed cDNA obtained from the C1 platform (Supplementary Table S15). We compared the Illumina SMART-Seq and FL-cDNA-Seq of single cells. When we considered the correlation between SMART-Seq and FL-cDNA-Seq of the aggregated reads of nine single cells (‘virtual bulks’), the correlation was reasonably high (R = 0.63) (Fig. 5A). However, when calculated at the single cell level, the correlation was R = 0.32–0.69 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The low correlation efficiencies reflected the fact that the number of reads was small for the FL-cDNA-Seq reads (Fig. 5B). We also compared the single cell data and bulk data of FL-cDNA-Seq, prepared using the same protocol. Between the virtual bulk of single cells and bulk, the correlation was moderately high (R = 0.69) (Supplementary Fig. S9A). When calculated between the single cells and bulk, the correlation was R = 0.11–0.67 (Supplementary Fig. S9B). The overall accuracy and RefSeq coverage of FL-cDNA-Seq reads were 93.2% and 43.2% (Fig. 5C). Although the still limited throughput of the MinION sequencer is not suitable for gene expression analysis at the single cell level, we found that some full-length transcript variants were over-represented in particular individual cells. MinION sequencing can be complementarily used for this purpose. Single cell FL-cDNA-Seq using C1.

ConclusionsIn this article, we evaluated current MinION sequencing and incorporated some modifications depending on the various applications. To our knowledge, this is the first article to survey the potential application of FL-cDNA-Seq, which may not be consistently easy with the current Illumina RNA-Seq. Indeed, our current knowledge regarding the transcriptome is almost limited to that obtained from Illumina or microarrays, which generally only represents information about fragmented transcripts. In contrast, FL-cDNA-Seq has enabled analysis of the entire transcript with respect to expression and base information at the isoform level. In this article, we demonstrated that these features first could enable one to take advantage of MinION long reads to gain novel insights in addition to the current transcriptome view. A no less important unique feature of the MinION sequencer is that it permits on-site sequencing without requiring any laboratory instruments for the sequencing. Because the flow cell as well as the data process software have been improved, now the sequencing yield has reached to more than 1 million reads. In our previous study, MinION sequencing of PCR amplicon from cDNA of clinical samples was performed.27 We could detect fusion genes and phase the hetero SNVs. It is assumed that FL-cDNA-Seq is also applicable for clinical samples. These advantages with the portable feature will further accelerated the compilation of transcriptome data. With the expansion of transcriptome information, we will be able to understand how the code of the genome and its mutations are linked to gene expression.We sincerely thank Hiroyuki Wakaguri, Terumi Horiuchi, and Yuta Kuze for assistance with the data analysis, and Kazumi Abe, Kiyomi Imamura, Yuni Ishikawa, Mari Tsubaki, Sachie Shimazu, Megumi Kombu, Etsuko Kobayashi, and Yusuke Ogishi for their experimental support.Accession numbersThe raw sequence reads generated in this study have been deposited at DDBJ under accession numbers RA006943D and DRA006942.FundingThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16H06279 and JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR15G3.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionWine fermentation is a complex biochemical process in which yeasts are the pivotal players. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the leading microorganism in conducting alcoholic fermentation of the grape must, it is being increasingly acknowledged the critical role of the remaining microbiota in shaping the properties of the produced wines giving rise to the concept of ‘microbial terroir’.1–3 In particular, the activity of many other yeast species belonging to various non-Saccharomyces genera has been found to greatly influence the course of the fermentation and also the sensory characteristics of the final wine.4,5 Apiculate yeasts of the Hanseniaspora genus are among the non-Saccharomyces species more abundant in grape-musts, particularly in the early stages of the fermentation.3,6–10 Although H. uvarum is usually the more abundant species,6,9,11 several studies also report a high abundance of H. guilliermondii.8,9,12–15 As observed with other Hanseniaspora species, the presence of H. guilliermondii has a positive effect in the aroma profile of wines16–19 as well as of other fermented beverages.20,21 In general, the positive contribution of non-Saccharomyces species (and of H. guilliermondii in particular) to the aroma profile of the wine is believed to result from their ability to produce esters, higher alcohols or glycerol, but also through the synthesis of enzymes (such as ß-glucosidases) that release flavor and aroma compounds (usually terpenols) present in the grapes as flavourless glycoconjugate precursors.4,5,Hanseniaspora species have also been used to improve the content in glycerol or mannoproteins22,23 or to reduce acidity or alcohol level.24–26When co-inoculated with S. cerevisae in grape-must H. guilliermondii predominates in an initial stage, however, as the fermentation proceeds its abundance decreases prominently.8,27–29 The low tolerance to ethanol has been suggested to account for the reduced fitness of H. guilliermondii in the later stages of the fermentation (in analogy to what was proposed for other non-Saccharomyces yeasts); however, the relatively high tolerance observed in some strains30 along with the demonstration that death of H. guilliermondii cells occurred in the presence of S. cerevisiae regardless of the amount of ethanol present in the fermentation broth,29 puts in question this simple model by which S. cerevisae and H. guilliermondii interact.31 Indeed, it was recently demonstrated that H. guilliermondii death in the presence of S. cerevisiae results from this latter species producing antimicrobial peptides that induce loss of cell viability in the H. guilliermondii cells upon cell–cell contacts.32Although it is clear that the presence of H. guilliermondii affects the performance of alcoholic fermentation, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying its interaction with S. cerevisiae cells are still elusive questions. In a first attempt to address this issue, Barbosa et al. have studied the effect exerted by H. guilliermondii on the genomic expression of S. cerevisiae during a mixed-culture fermentation of a natural grape-must.27 The expression of about 300 S. cerevisiae genes was altered by the presence of H. guilliermondii, in comparison with the corresponding transcript levels registered in single-cultures.27,Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in the biosynthesis of vitamins were enriched among those found to be more up-regulated in the mixed S. cerevisiae–H. guilliermondii fermentation, while genes related with the uptake and biosynthesis of amino acids were enriched among those more expressed in the single-culture.27 Notably, the differences in the aroma profiles of the wines obtained in mixed-culture fermentations, appeared to be tightly correlated with the changes observed in the transcript profile of S. cerevisae genes related with formation of the aroma compounds observed in mixed-culture fermentations and attributable to the presence of H. guilliermondii.27The first annotated genomic sequence of a H. guilliermondii strain (the UTAD222 strain, also focused in this work) was recently released33 accompanying the releases of genomic sequences for H. uvarum (strains AWRI3580 and DSM2768)34,35 and H. opuntiae (strain AWRI3578).34 However, in those short studies, the information coming from the release of these genomic sequences was not explored, this being an essential aspect to better understand the biology and physiology of the Hanseniaspora species, specially in the context of wine fermentation. In this work, a thorough analysis of the H. guilliermondii genomic sequence was performed, involving not only extensive functional analysis of the H. guilliermondii genome but also a comparative analysis with H. uvarum, H. opuntiae and also S. cerevisiae. Exploring those comparative genomic results a chromosomal map for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain is proposed, this being the first time that this information is given for a strain of this species.2. Materials and methods2.1. StrainsIn this work, 33 indigenous strains from the UTAD culture collection having a presumptive identification of belonging to the Hanseniaspora genus were used, these being listed in Supplementary Table S1. The strains were recovered from 10 different wineries of the Douro Demarcated Region in Portugal and were isolated from grapes, grape-must or wine. Pre-selection of these autochthons was based on the ability to grow on l-lysine agar selective medium followed by microscopic examination of the size, morphology and reproduction mode of the cells. Although two non-Saccharomyces genera associated with winemaking environment are characterized by bipolar budding, Hanseniaspora and Saccharomycodes, the first can be easily distinguished from the second by the smaller size of the cells. Seven reference strains were also used: H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECTT 11206, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T, from the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT); and H. guilliermondii CBS465T and H. opuntiae CBS8733T obtained from CBS-KNAW fungal collection (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. Genotypic characterization of a cohort of indigenous Hanseniaspora strainsThirty-two autochthonous Hanseniaspora strains along with the above-mentioned reference strains were subjected to (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting for species identification. To extract the DNA from the isolates, two loopfulls of freshly grown cultures were resuspended in 500 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 250 mM. NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.3% SDS, pH 8.0). After adding one volume of phenol (pH 8.0), cells were disrupted by bead-beating for 30 s at speed 4.0 using a Fastprep cell disrupter (Bio101, Inc), followed by standard phenol: chloroform extraction. Total DNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by the addition of 2 vol of ice-cold ethanol and of 1/10 volume of 3 M Na-acetate for 60 min at -70°C. The precipitated DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C; the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in water. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 µl reaction volumes containing ~10 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer, 0.4 mM of each of the four dNTPs, 1 µM primer (GTG)5 5'-GTGGTGGTGGTGGTG-3' and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The amplification conditions used were: initial template denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing at 31°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 2 min. A final elongation at 72°C for 7 min was performed in the end. PCR products were separated on a 1.2% TBE agarose gel and were visualized after staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/ml) and the DNA banding patterns analysed using the BioNumerics software (Applied Maths). Similarities among isolates were estimated using the Pearson coefficient and clustering was based on the UPGMA method. The identification of the autochthonous isolates was achieved by comparing their genotype profiles with those of the reference strains. To further support the results obtained, representatives of each cluster identified in the PCR fingerprinting were selected for 26S rDNA D1/D2 sequencing using primers NL-1 (5'-GCA TAT CAA TAA GCG GAG GAA AAG-3') and NL-4 (5'-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG G-3'). The obtained 26S rDNA D1/D2 sequences were deposited at NCBI under accession numbers (MG832576 to MG832583, MG877743 and MG87744). The sequences obtained were compared with other sequences reported in the GenBank using the BLAST algorithm and a phylogenetic tree was obtained using a neighbor-joining algorithm. Species identification was ascribed to an isolate if its 26S rDNA D1/D2 sequence differed by no more than 2–3 base substitutions (i.e.  = 99.0% sequence identity) to that of a taxonomically accepted species type strain. Differentiation of H. opuntiae and H. guilliermondii was achieved by 5.8S-ITS-RFLP analysis, in which ITS1/ITS4 amplification products were digested with restriction enzyme DraI, and separated on 2% agarose gel on 1× TBE buffer as previously described.362.3. Phenotypic screening of the cohort of indigenous Hanseniaspora strainsThe autochthonous Hanseniaspora strains were phenotypically profiled for relevant oenological traits, including their ability to excrete ß-glucosidases, proteases and pectinases, potential to produce H2S and resistance to ethanol, sulphur dioxide (SO2), cerulenine and 5,5,5-trifluoro-dl-leucine (TFL). All assays were performed using 3 µl of a cell suspension (at an OD600nm of 0.1) prepared from an overnight pre-culture in YPD growth medium (containing, per liter, 20 g of glucose, 10 g yeast extract and 20 g bactopeptone). ß-glycosidase activity was tested as previously described.37 Briefly, yeast cells were grown in a medium containing 0.5% of arbutine as the sole carbon source, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% agar (adjusted at pH 5.0 prior sterilization) and supplemented with 2 ml (per 100 ml of medium) ferric ammonium citrate solution (1% w/v). The plates were incubated at 30°C and ß-glycosidase activity was observed after 2, 4, 6 and 8 h by the appearance of a dark brown color in the colonies. A non-inoculated plate of arbutin agar was used as a negative control. Proteolytic activity was determined assessing growth on skim milk agar plates, after incubation for 3–8 days at 30°C38 while the potential ability to produce H2S was evaluated by growing yeast cells in Biggy agar.37 The strains were classified in different categories according with the appearance of a brown-black coloration of the colonies, which is directly correlated with sulfite-reductase activity. Resistance to SO2 and ethanol were evaluated on YPD agar medium (buffered at pH 3.5), supplemented with increasing concentrations of SO2 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 mM) or ethanol (5.0, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0 and 10% v/v). Susceptibility phenotypes were registered after incubation at 30°C during 3 days, after visual inspection of colonies growth and comparison with growth observed in non-supplemented YPD agar. Resistance to TFL and cerulenin was assessed by determining growth on agar plates containing 0.67% of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% of agar supplemented with glucose (2% w/v) in combination with TFL (1 mM) or cerulenin (25 or 100 µM). The plates were maintained at 30°C for 5 days and colonies that developed on the plates containing the inhibitors were considered resistant to TFL or cerulenin.39 Based on all the phenotypic data gathered, cluster analysis was carried out using SAS JMP 11.0 (JMP, 2011, Cary, NC) and a phenogram of yeast strains was obtained with Euclidean distance as an association measure and complete linkage as the agglomeration method.2.4. Genome sequencing, assembly and comparison of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genome with those available for other Hanseniaspora speciesThe genome of the UTAD222 strain was sequenced at StabVida (Portugal) using a whole-genome shotgun approach that explored paired-end Illumina MiSeq platform, as briefly described before.33 In specific, the genomic DNA of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 was extracted and used to construct a DNA library having inserts in the range of 250–350 bp. Library amplification was performed on the cluster generation station of the GAIIx and using the Illumina cluster generation kit. To obtain the paired-end reads, primers were designed to hybridized with Illumina specific adaptors resulting in reading of each end as a separate run. The sequencing reaction was run for 100 cycles (tagging, imaging and cleavage of one terminal base at a time), and four images of each tile on the chip were taken in different wavelengths for exciting each base-specific fluorophore. The obtained reads were afterwards assembled into contigs using the de novo assembler available on the CLC Genomics Workbench (version 9; Quiagen) set at default parameters. The obtained 208 contigs were organized into seven chromosomes, based on the identification of seven chromosomal bands in PFGE analysis of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genomic DNA and using as a reference the proposed organization for the genome of H. uvarum DSM2768.35 To perform this organization, an iterative process was used: at first, whole-genome alignments of the UTAD222 contigs and the contigs available described for H. uvarum AWRI3580 and H. opuntiae AWRI357834 were performed using Mauve Contig Mover.40 These whole-genome alignments were performed using the default parameters (match seed weight 15, min LBC weight 200, scoring matrix HOXD). Whenever possible the whole-genome alignments were also performed using the contigs available for the H. uvarum DSM2768 strain.35 To reinforce the organization proposed by the whole-genome alignments, it was investigated colinearity between the genomes of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum AWRI3580 and H. opuntiae AWRI3578. For this, pairwise alignments between the proteins predicted for the three species were performed and the best hits selected. These best hit pairs were then mapped in the contig organization proposed by the whole-genome alignments giving rise to the figures shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. As shown, in the vast majority of the cases it was possible to confirm colinearity with the best gene orthologues between the three species being located contiguously. To get further confirmation that the proposed organization for UTAD222 contigs was correct a number of junctions (chosen in all chromosomes) were experimentally validated by PCR. While some these PCR reactions were randomly chosen, others aimed at solving divergences identified in the whole-genome alignments. This is, for example, the case of contigs 4 and 5 which were mapped to chromosomes G and F, respectively, in H. guilliermondii, but that in H. uvarum and H. opuntiae are located in other genomic regions (as highlighted in Supplementary Fig. S3). All contig junctions experimentally verified are highlighted in Supplementary Fig. S3.2.5. Annotation of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genome and subsequent comparison with the proteome described for other Hanseniaspora species and for S. cerevisiaePrimary structural annotation of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genome was achieved by applying three de novo prediction programs: (i) Fgenesh with different matrices (trained on Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora crassa and a mixed matrix based on different species);41 (ii) GeneMark-ES42 and (iii) Augustus.43 The different gene structures and evidences were displayed in GBrowse allowing manual validation and, whenever needed, correction of the predicted coding sequences. In specific, gene models differently predicted by the algorithms were manually curated based on the structure obtained for homologues found in related annotated genomes including H. uvarum, H. opuntiae and S. cerevisiae. The final call set comprises 4,070 protein coding genes. tRNA-encoding genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE.44 The protein coding genes were analysed and functionally annotated using the Pedant system.45 The genome and annotation were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive, ENA at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/FQNF01000001–FQNF01000208. Metabolic reconstruction of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 metabolic network was performed using KEGG Koala reconstruction tool,46 choosing Fungi as the taxonomy group of the genome and allowing the KEEG database to be searched for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. The comparison of the proteomes of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 with the proteomes of H. uvarum, H. opuntiae or S. cerevisae EC1118 was based on BLASTP using the sets of proteins available for each one of these species. Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 proteins were consider similar to those present in other Hanseniaspora spp (or in S. cerevisiae EC1118) when the associated alignment had an associated e-value below e-20 and a minimum of identity of 30%. Pairwise alignments between H. uvarum/H. guilliermondii (or H. opuntiae/H. guilliermondii) having an identity between 30 and 50% were considered similar, while those having an associated identity >50% were considered highly similar. Under these conditions, we could identify 3,958 highly similar and 65 similar H. guilliermondii/H. opuntiae protein pairs; 3,790 highly similar and 169 similar H. guilliermondii/H. uvarum protein pairs; and 1,906 highly similar and 771 similar H. guilliermondii/S. cerevisiae protein pairs.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genotypic screening of a cohort of autochthonous Hanseniaspora strainsPrior studies have addressed the genetic diversity of Hanseniaspora strains in French and Italian wine producing regions, for example,8,10,15 however, no equivalent information was available for Portuguese wine producing areas. Recent reports describing the microbiomes of Portuguese wine regions have unveiled a high frequency for members of the Hanseniaspora genus,47,48 but the data gathered did not allowed discrimination at the strain level. To get insights into this, we have examined the distribution of species in a cohort of 30 strains presumptively identified as belonging to the Hanseaniaspora genus, and that also included the UTAD222 strain focused in this work. These presumed Hanseniaspora strains were isolated from grapes, grape-must or wine obtained in different wineries across the Demarcated Douro region (details in Supplementary Fig. S1) and that also included the herein focused UTAD222 strain. To characterize the genetic diversity of the strains, PCR fingerprinting was used. As controls, five reference strains from the Spanish Culture Collection representative of Hanseniaspora species already described to be present in grape-musts were included in this screening: H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECT11206T, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T. The results obtained clearly showed that the strains under examination could be divided in six groups (at a cut-off value of 50% similarity, Fig. 1A). The method used had a good discriminating power at the species level since the five reference strains were clustered separately (Fig. 1A). To obtain further information concerning the identification of the strains, the conserved ITS region of a randomly selected set of strains representative of each one of the groups (UTAD53, UTAD222, UTAD617, UTAD618 e UTAD621) was obtained and compared with sequences attributed to Hanseniaspora strains deposited at NCBI generating the phylogenetic tree that is shown in Fig. 1B. Strains UTAD53 and UTAD618 were identified as belonging to the H. uvarum species, while strain UTAD222 was identified as H. guilliermondii (Fig. 1B), this being in agreement with the results of the PCR fingerprinting (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, sequencing of the D1/D2 region of strain UTAD617 that clustered with the H. guilliermondii reference strain in the PCR fingerprinting, identified this strain as belonging to the H. opuntiae species (Fig. 1B). Previous reports showed a close genetic relatedness between H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae,36,49 which could account for a difficulty in discriminating these two species with the PCR fingerprinting used. Thus, we have compared the profile of bands obtained upon digestion with DraI of the ITS region of strains UTAD616, UTAD617, UTAD620, UTAD621, UTAD222 since this method allows a clear distinction between H. opuntiae (three bands with expected sizes of 420, 300 and 30 bp) and H. guilliermondii (four bands with expected sizes of 420, 150, 130 and 30 bp).49 The reference strains H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. opuntiae CBS8733T and H. guilliermondii CBS465T were also used in this assay as controls (Fig. 1C). The pattern of bands obtained for strain UTAD222 is similar to the one of CBS465T, confirming the identification of the isolate as H. guilliermondii (Fig. 1C). UTAD616 and UTAD621 isolates, whose species identification could not be achieved in the PCR fingerprinting, were also identified as H. guilliermondii. UTAD617 and UTAD620 were identified as H. opuntiae (Fig. 1C), as well as the reference strain CECT11027T, which is in accordance with the close similarity of these three strains observed by PCR fingerprinting (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the reference strain CECT11027T was identified as H. opuntiae. The genetic analysis performed rendered clear the higher predominance of H. uvarum strains in our small cohort of strains, this predominance being in line with what is reported in Iberian wine producing regions.6,12,48 It was also clear the absence of a correlation between the genotype affiliation and the geographical origin of the Hanseniaspora isolates recovered, indicating that grape-musts from a particular grape variety or winery do not appear to be preferentially colonized by a specific strain (Fig. 1A). Consistently, the absence of a specific genetic signature in a given winery or in grape varieties was also reported in other studies focusing the genetic diversity of H. uvarum and H. guilliermondii isolates.10,50Genetic characterization, based on PCR-fingerprinting, of the 33 UTAD Hanseniaspora strains recovered from the Douro demarcated region and of the selected reference strains H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECT 11206T, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T; (A) Dendrogram obtained by hierarchical analysis of PCR (GTG)5 patterns using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and UPGMA clustering method; (B) Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of selected Hanseniaspora strains (marked with an asterisk in A), inferred from the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the LSU RNA gene.

The squares designate the different wineries from where the isolates were retrieved.3.2. Phenotypic screening of the autochthonous Hanseniaspora strains for interesting oenological propertiesThe set of strains previously used in the genotypic screening was subjected to a phenotypic characterization focused on relevant oenological properties such as tolerance to sulphur dioxide and ethanol, ability to grow in presence of 5,5,5-trifluoro-dl-leucine (TFL) or cerulenin and activity of sulphite reductase, proteases or ß-glucosidases (Fig. 2). The results obtained showed a significant variation in the phenotypic profile of the H. uvarum isolates tested (e.g. strains showed a marked difference in tolerance to ethanol or to SO2), while the three H. guilliermondii isolates (UTAD616, UTAD621, UTAD222) exhibited, in general, a more similar phenotypic profile (Fig. 2). The H. opuntiae isolates exhibited similar phenotypic traits to those exhibited by the H. guilliermondii isolates, with the exception of the reference strain CECT11027T that differed by having lower sulphite reductase activity and higher resistance to ethanol (Fig. 2). Another aspect that emerged from this phenotypic analysis was the considerably low protease activity and low tolerance to ethanol of most H. uvarum isolates, in comparison with the isolates gathered from the other Hanseniaspora species and, in particular, with the H. guilliermondii isolates (Fig. 2). This observation is in line with previous studies reporting a higher resilience of H. guilliermondii to ethanol stress, specially when compared with other non-Saccharomyces species.30 The interesting oenological properties herein observed for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain, namely the low activity of sulphite reductase, the high protease activity and the high tolerance to ethanol, reinforce the interest in deepening the study of this strain specially in what concerns to the analysis of its genome sequence. Phenomic characterization of the Hanseniaspora indigenous strains concerning relevant oenological properties. Besides the isolates, the type strains H. opuntiae CECT11027T (formerly designated as H. guilliermondii but herein demonstrated to be H. opuntiae), H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECT 11206T, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T. After conducting the phenotypic tests (in triplicate), the results were used to build the heat map shown in the figure and used for the subsequent clustering analysis shown. Strains classification was based on the results of the PCR fingerprinting and, in some cases, also based on results of the D1/D2 sequencing and subsequent analysis of the DraI restriction profile (to distinguish between the H. opuntiae and H. guilliermondii strains). Hanseniaspora uvarum strains are identified in light blue, H. opuntiae strains in green and H. guilliermondii in red.Phenomic characterization of the Hanseniaspora indigenous strains concerning relevant oenological properties.

Hanseniaspora uvarum strains are identified in light blue, H. opuntiae strains in green and H. guilliermondii in red.To obtain the genome sequence of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain, two independent rounds of paired-end MiSeq Illumina-sequencing were used.33 The assembly of the ca. 54 million reads obtained resulted in 208 contigs, yielding a total of 9,037,850 assembled bases (Table 1). This size predicted for the genome of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain is in line with the genome size described for H. uvarum (ranging between 8.8. and 9.7 Mb34,35) and H. opuntiae (8.8 Mb).34 The predicted GC content of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 is ~31%, also in line with the percentages reported for other Hanseniaspora species (34.7% for H. opuntiae and 31.6% for H. uvarum) and for S. cerevisiae strains (38%). Prior karyotyping of H. guilliermondii wine strains from different geographical origins suggested that that this species is equipped with seven chromosomes, the same number that was attributed to most H. uvarum strains.35,51,52 In line with these results, karyotyping of the UTAD222 strain also revealed seven chromosomal bands (Supplementary Fig. S2). Using this information and also taking advantage of the recently proposed chromosomal map for H. uvarum DSM2768 strain35 and the close similarity between H. guilliermondii, H. opuntiae and H. uvarum species, we have built an organized chromosomal map of the 208 contigs obtained for the UTAD222 strain (Fig. 3 and further information provided in Supplementary Fig. S3). With this approach 192 out of the 208 contigs obtained for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain were assigned to the 7 H. guilliermondii chromosomes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Among the non-assigned contigs was contig 141 (with an approximate size of 12 kb) which is predicted to be the mitochondrial chromosome, based on the high similarity with the mitochondrial sequence described for H. uvarum.53 Comparison with the genomes H. uvarum AWRI3580 and H. opuntiae AWRI3578 proteins evidenced a significant colinearity since in the large majority of the cases orthologues between these species were found to be located contiguously. Despite the large genomic similarity, two relevant genomic alterations were observed in the genome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 corresponding to presumable translocations in chromosomes C, G and F, as detailed in Supplementary Fig. S3. Another aspect that was also rendered clear by our comparative analysis was a higher divergence of the H. uvarum DSM2768 strain, comparing to H. opuntiae AWRI3578, H. guilliermondii UTAD222 and even to H. uvarum AWRI3580 (Supplementary Fig. S3). With the data available, it is not possible to conclude if this divergence corresponds to a different genomic architectures of this strain or if it result from misleading attribution of contigs in the DSM2768 chromosomes since this assignment was very much based on adjusting the size of the chromosomes to the size of the contigs, thereby differing from the herein presented comparative genome analysis.

In yellow, the contig including information predicted to harbour viral DNA is highlighted, while in green, the mitochondrial chromosome is highlighted.Automatic annotation of the genome sequence of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 was firstly performed using ab initio gene detection, afterwards manually curated to refine the results obtained by the informatics analysis. The predicted ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 is estimated in 4,070 protein-encoding genes and 79 tRNAs (Table 1). The incidence of introns is ~1.8%, in line with the low percentages described for other yeast species.54 In specific, 98% (corresponding to 3,998 genes) of the genes were predicted to be intron-free, 69 genes predicted to have two exons and three genes predicted to have three exons. The 4,070 genes that compose the predicted UTAD222 ORFeome were clustered according to their physiological function using MIPS-based Functional Catalogue. As depicted in Fig. 4, the number of H. guilliermondii genes (as well as of H. opuntiae and H. uvarum) included in each functional category was, on an average 70% the number of genes considered for S. cerevisiae, used herein as reference considering the extensive information available on gene functional analysis for this yeast species. This observation along with the fact that many of the H. guilliermondii proteins are similar to more than one S. cerevisiae protein (as detailed in Supplementary Table S5), strongly indicates that H. guilliermondii is a pre-genome duplication species, a trait that has been proposed for this species55 and recently demonstrated for H. uvarum.35Functional clustering of the proteins predicted to be encoded by H. guilliermondii UTAD222. Using the annotated and manually validated H. guilliermondii gene models (Hg), functional clustering was performed using MIPS functional catalogue. For the sake of comparison, a similar analysis was also performed for H. uvarum AWRI3578 (Hu), H. opuntiae AWRI3580 (Ho) and S. cerevisiae S288c (Sc) proteomes. For this, the different sets of proteins predicted to be encoded by the genomes of these three species were imported into Pedant database and then clustered, based on physiological function, using MIPS functional catalogue.Functional clustering of the proteins predicted to be encoded by H. guilliermondii UTAD222.

The results show that the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain is equipped with genes encoding enzymes involved in all major pathways of central carbon metabolism including glycolysis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway as well as the anaplerotic enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme (Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably, no genes encoding the key neoglucogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase could be found among H. guilliermondii predicted proteins (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Homologues of these proteins have also not been identified in the predicted proteomes of H. uvarum, H. opuntiae, H. vineae, H. osmophila and H. valbensys (results not shown) suggesting that the absence of a functional neoglucogenesis is a feature of the Hanseniaspora genus. This is a particular interesting trait since robust orthologues for these enzymes are present in members of all the other families that compose the Saccharomycetales order including Saccharomycetaceae, Metschnikowiaceae and Pichiaceae that, like Hanseniaspora, also harbour wine species (results not shown). Consistent with the described ability of H. guilliermondii to use fructose,18,27,56 genes involved in catabolism of this hexose were predicted in the metabolic network of the UTAD222 strain, as well as genes involved in utilization of mannose and starch (Fig. 5). Conversely, genes required for the catabolism of xylose, galactose, lactate, acetate or glycerol were absent from H. guilliermondii genetic repertoire (and also from H. uvarum and H. opuntiae) including isocitrate lyase, galactokinase and glycerol or lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 5). The lack of these genes is consistent with the inability of UTAD222 cells to grow using these carbohydrates as the sole sources of carbon and energy (Supplementary Fig. S6). Although up to now the preferences of Hanseniaspora species concerning carbon sources have essentially focused their ability to consume glucose and/or fructose, it was recently reported the inability of H. uvarum wine isolates to use glycerol as the sole carbon source.50 Overall, the reconstruction of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 complemented with further analysis on the genome of other species having the genome sequenced shows that Hanseniaspora species appear to have a narrow range of carbon sources that can be used among those available in grape-musts, this being a factor that may contribute to reduce their competitiveness in the grape-must environment in which a strong competition for carbon sources is expected to occur. Predicted metabolic network of H. guilliermondii focused on carbon (A) or on nitrogen/sulphur metabolism (B), as suggested by in silico metabolic reconstruction of the gathered genomics data. The gene models predicted for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 were clustered according with the biochemical pathways they are predicted to be involved in using KEGG reconstruction tool. These results (shown in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4) along with the in silico comparative proteome analyses performed with H. opuntiae, H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae (described below) were used to draw the schematic representation herein presented.Predicted metabolic network of H. guilliermondii focused on carbon (A) or on nitrogen/sulphur metabolism (B), as suggested by in silico metabolic reconstruction of the gathered genomics data.

These results (shown in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4) along with the in silico comparative proteome analyses performed with H. opuntiae, H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae (described below) were used to draw the schematic representation herein presented.Genes encoding enzymes required for the biosynthesis of all proteinogenic amino acids could be predicted from the proteome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222, as well as those genes involved in the incorporation of ammonia to glutamine via a NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase similar to ScGdh2 (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5). Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 is also equipped with a functional transsulfuration pathway for sulphate assimilation, although no genes could be detected for the methionine salvage pathway (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5). This observation is consistent with the lack of genes predicted to be involved in synthesis of polyamines (Supplementary Fig. S5) considering that one of the functions of the methionine salvage pathway is to supply precursors for the synthesis of spermine and spermidine (Fig. 5B). The fact that H. guilliermondii (and also H. opuntiae and H. uvarum) do not encode genes for synthesis of spermidine is interesting considering that this is an essential nutrient for S. cerevisiae growth.57 Spermine and spermidine are among the biogenic amines known to be present in grape-musts and they can also be produced along the alcoholic fermentation,58 which thereby turns possible for Hanseniaspora spp to eventually scavenge these nutrients from the environment rather than prompting their synthesis.Another relevant observation that emerged from the reconstruction of the metabolic network of the UTAD222 strain was the absence of genes involved in biosynthesis of thiamine, pyridoxal, pyridoxine, biotin and for the de novo synthesis of nicotinic acid (Fig. 5B). The absence of these genes is consistent with the previously described auxotrophy of H. guilliermondii for thiamin, niacin, biotin and pyridoxine.59 The inability of Hanseniaspora species to synthesize these vitamins is likely to be a relevant factor in the described low fermentative capacity of these species, particularly in the case of thiamine whose abundance was found to determine the glycolytic flux and, consequently, the fermentation rate of S. cerevisiae cells.60,61 To respond to the depletion of thiamine, S. cerevisiae genes involved in biosynthesis of this vitamin are strongly up-regulated in stationary phase and wine yeast strains were found to evolve adaptive responses to improve the expression of these genes and, consequently, to improve the fermentation rate in grape-musts.61 Consistent with the idea that H. guilliermondii scavenges vitamins from the environment, S. cerevisiae genes involved in synthesis of thiamine (ScTHI20 and ScTHI21), biotin (ScBIO3) or pyridoxine (e.g. ScSNO1), were among those found to be more strongly up-regulated during cultivation in the presence of H. guilliermondii UTAD222.273.3. The ‘transportome’ of H. guilliermondii UTAD222Around 600 genes are predicted to have a transport-related function in H. guilliermondii UTAD222, similar to the number of H. uvarum and H. opuntiae proteins predicted to have this function (Supplementary Table S2). A closer analysis into this ‘transportome’ of H. guilliermondii UTAD222, revealed that it is equipped with 22 predicted sugar transporters, 10 of these being predicted to be hexose transporters (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5). All these putative H. guilliermondii hexose transporters were found to harbour a very high similarity with the high-affinity glucose transporter ScHxt262 or with ScGal2, the galactose permease that has also been shown to transport glucose with a moderate affinity.62 Although H. guilliermondii strains (including UTAD222, Supplementary Fig. S6) are fructophilic56,63,64 there was no orthologue of the fructose specific transporters Ffz1 or Fsy1.65,66 This observation is consistent with results of a previous study that pinpointed the H. guilliermondii NCYC2380 strain as exhibiting fructophilic behaviour but not harbouring Ffz-like genes.56 A large survey for Ffz-like genes in Fungi has also failed to identify robust orthologues for these transporters in the genome of H. uvarum, another reported fructophilic yeast,64,67 as well as in H. vineae and H. valbensyis.68 Interestingly, the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 protein showing a higher similarity with Z. bailii Ffz1 (e-value of the associated alignment of -56, 27% identity) is HGUI01014, predicted to be a polyamine exporter based on its high degree of similarity with the MFS multi-drug resistance transport ScTpo1 (e-value of the associated alignment of -156, 57% identity) (Supplementary Table S2). Further studies are required to better understand what could be the function of predicted hexose transporters in H. guilliermondii and, in specific, if they are somehow able to contribute for the fructophilic behaviour of the species by mediating fructose transport. Phosphorylation of fructose mediated by hexokinases is another critical parameter that was shown to determine the capacity of wine S. cerevisiae strains to use fructose in detriment of glucose.69,70 Thus, it can also be hypothesized that the two hexokinases predicted to be encoded by H. guilliermondii UTAD222 (HGUI_01771, 47% identity with glucokinase ScGlk1 and HGUI_03922, 72% identity) could have a higher affinity for fructose than for glucose. Indeed, preliminary results have shown that Z. bailii encodes a hexokinase having a preference for fructose (over glucose) phosphorylation,71 the hexokinases encoded by H. guilliermondii showing a very high similarity (99% identity at the amino acid level) with those encoded by Z. bailii strains having their genome sequenced (results not shown).Thirty-two H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genes are predicted to encode transporters of nitrogenous compounds (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 5) including permeases for amino acids, ammonium, allantoin, urea and GABA (Fig. 5). Remarkably, 13 of the predicted H. guilliermondii amino acid permeases bear the highest similarity with the general amino acid permeases ScGAP1 and ScAGP1, only being possible to identify specific permeases for lysine and methionine (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5). Indeed, almost all S. cerevisiae amino acid-specific permeases were found to be absent in H. guilliermondii and also in H. opuntiae and in H. uvarum (Supplementary Table S5 and Table 4). This observation suggests that Hanseniaspora species favor the utilization of permeases with a broader range of substrates in detriment of using specific permeases, which is a reasonable adaptive mechanism since the amount of nitrogen present in wine musts is largely variable and composed by different amino acids.3.3.1. The H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ‘flavorome’It is known that H. guilliermondii affects the production of volatile compounds of wines when in consortium with S. cerevisiae.16–18,27 Other studies have also reported the ability of H. guilliermondii itself to produce compounds having an impact in wine aroma even in single-culture including 2-phenyl ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isobutyric acid, ethyl esters and higher alcohols, albeit in most of these cases the production titers are below those reported for S. cerevisiae.16–19,72 Consistent with these observations, reconstruction of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 metabolic network shows that this strain is equipped with four genes encoding ß-glucosidases, as well as genes required for synthesis of acetaldehyde, ethyl esters and higher alcohols (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S3). Notably, it was not found within the UTAD222 ORFeome proteins similar to the S. cerevisae acetyl transferases involved in synthesis of acetate esters ScATF1, ScATF2 and ScAYT1, although it is known that these are precisely the aroma compounds whose production is more strongly impacted by the presence of H. guilliermondii.17,19,72 Four proteins (HGUI_00697, HGUI_00952, HGUI_01907 and HGUI_01910) harboring motifs conserved within the alcohol acetyltransferase enzyme family were identified in the predicted proteome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222, these proteins only having orthologues in other species of the Hanseniaspora genus (Supplementary Table S3). Further studies are required to confirm if these proteins do represent a novel set of acetyl transferases involved in synthesis of aroma compounds. Another observation of remark was the absence of aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases required for synthesis of higher alcohols from corresponding aldehydes in H. guilliermondii, which could contribute for the reported lower ability of this species to produce these compounds, specially when compared with S. cerevisiae. Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 genes predicted to be involved in formation of aroma compounds. Based on results of metabolic reconstruction and also on orthology with S. cerevisiae genes, the set of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genes predicted to be involved in pathways leading to the production of aroma compounds was identified. Further details on these genes involved in the ‘flavorome’ of H. guilliermondii are provided in Supplementary Table S4. No genes encoding acetyl transferases involved in synthesis of acetate esters could be predicted in the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ORFeome and comparative analysis with the proteins having such a function in S. cerevisiae also did not produce results. Nonetheless, four proteins (HGUI_00697, HGUI_00952, HGUI_01907 and HGUI_01910) with motifs found in acetyl transferases were identified in H. guilliermondii suggesting that these could represent a new class of these enzymes.Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 genes predicted to be involved in formation of aroma compounds.

Nonetheless, four proteins (HGUI_00697, HGUI_00952, HGUI_01907 and HGUI_01910) with motifs found in acetyl transferases were identified in H. guilliermondii suggesting that these could represent a new class of these enzymes.3.3.2. Comparative analysis of the predicted proteomes of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum and H. opuntiaeTo contribute for a better understanding of the differences and similarities existing among H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum and H. opuntiae, the UTAD222 predicted proteins were compared with those predicted for H. opuntiae AWRI3578 and for H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM2768 strains). This comparative analysis rendered clear a very high similarity between the predicted ORFeomes of these three Hanseniaspora species, more evident for H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table S4). Fourteen H. guilliermondii proteins had no orthologue in H. opuntiae AWRI3578 or H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM2768 strains), these being listed in Table 2. Nine of these proteins had a robust homologue in H. valbyensis indicating that their presence is not specific of the H. guilliermondii species (Table 2). The remaining five proteins could not be identified in the genome of any other species of the Hanseniaspora genus, although homologues could be identified in the genome of other fungal species such as Rhizopus microspores, Zygosaccharomyces bailii or Saitoella complicate (Table 2). These five proteins are all of viral origin including components necessary for the formation of capsid and spike and also a protein required for replication of viral dsDNA (Table 2). The fact that the genes encoding these proteins are contiguous and located in the same genomic region (contig 168) and also the observation that this genomic region exhibits a very strong homology (>95% identity at the nucleotide level) with the genomic sequences of bacteriophages, suggest that H. guilliermondii UTAD222 harbors a viral genome. The existence of viral DNA has been well documented in other wine yeast species including S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and Z. bailii,73 this being responsible for the killer phenotype that allows cells to secrete toxin(s) to the growth medium that will cause death of sensitive species. In the cases of the three above referred yeast species, the killer phenotype is mediated by non-infectious dsRNA viruses,73 but this phenotype can also be chromosomally encoded or associated with dsDNA plasmids.73 Up to now the ability of H. guilliermondii to induce the killer phenotype has not been studied and the viral genomic sequence herein uncovered does not provide enough information to understand if a toxin can indeed be produced by UTAD222 cells. Nonetheless, this is a topic deserving further investigation considering the role that the killer phenotype has in shaping competitiveness of wine yeast species. Results obtained from the comparative analysis of the predicted H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ORFeome with the set of proteins predicted for H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM7210 strains) or H. opuntiaeIn this table, a selected set of proteins was chosen to illustrate those only found in H. guilliermondii, those found in H. guilliermondii and in H. opuntiae and those found in H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum. A more comprehensive list including all the results is provided in Supplementary Table S5.Results obtained from the comparative analysis of the predicted H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ORFeome with the set of proteins predicted for H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM7210 strains) or H. opuntiaeIn this table, a selected set of proteins was chosen to illustrate those only found in H. guilliermondii, those found in H. guilliermondii and in H. opuntiae and those found in H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum. A more comprehensive list including all the results is provided in Supplementary Table S5.Another aspect of relevance that emerged from the comparative analysis between the H. guilliermondii, H. opuntiae and H. uvarum proteomes was the identification of 26 proteins only shared by H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum and of 87 proteins only shared by H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae. A full list of these proteins is provided in Supplementary Table S4 and a selected set in Table 2. From the functional point of view, the proteins apparently absent in H. opuntiae include an enzyme predicted to be involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (HGUI_00394), several proteins involved in post-translational modifications (HGUI_03286, HGUI_03882, HGUI_03882, HGUI_03514) and in intracellular protein trafficking (HGUI_03532, HGUI_03531, HGUI_02284) (Supplementary Table S3 and Table 2). Within the data set of proteins apparently absent in H. uvarum, it was possible to identify an homologue of a putative vacuolar membrane copper transporter (HGUI_03602), two proteins involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (HGUI_02076, HGUI_01086) and a putative ß-glucosidase (HGUI_00707). Considering the lack of information concerning the functionality of these proteins, it is hard to link the presence/absence of these proteins with physiological traits of the different Hanseniaspora species, although this is certainly a topic deserving further attention.3.3.3. Comparative analysis of the predicted proteomes of Hanseniaspora spp. and S. cerevisiae: emphasis on genes associated with tolerance to oenological relevant stressesHanseniaspora spp. are known to have multiple phenotypic traits different from those observed in S. cerevisiae wine strains (e.g. different fermentation rates and ability to use terpene-like molecules for the production of aroma compounds)4 and thus, we have hypothesized whether this could result from divergences in the proteomes of the different species. To scrutinize this, the set of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 predicted proteins was compared with those described for the S. cerevisiae wine strain EC1118, widely used for wine-making and having a well annotated genomic sequence.74 The results of this in silico proteomic analysis are detailed in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. Approximately 1,294 H. guilliermondii proteins had no robust homologue in the S. cerevisiae strains examined (listed in Supplementary Table S5). This could occur either because the S. cerevisiae strains do not encode these proteins or because the proteins with a corresponding function are highly divergent from those one found in H. guilliermondii. These H. guilliermondii proteins that had no orthologue in S. cerevisiae were present in H. uvarum and in H. opuntiae (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table S5), suggesting that they comprise specific proteins of the Hanseniaspora genus. The majority of these ‘Hanseniaspora-specific’ proteins (879) have a poorly characterized function but we could identify ß-glucosidases (e.g. HGUI_02084, HGUI_02647 and HGUI_02781), flocculins (e.g. HGUI_01978, HGUI_03264, HGUI_04053, HGUI_01804, HGUI_03963 and HGUI_03989), proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and in translation, as well as proteins involved in respiration and in metabolism of various carbohydrate and nitrogen compounds (Supplementary Table S5). The identification of ß-glucosidase-encoding genes within the set of the putative ‘Hanseniaspora-specific’ genes was expected considering the demonstration of the influence of members of this species, including H. guilliermondii, in increasing the amount of terpenes present in wines;75 a phenotypic trait that is absent in S. cerevisiae strains.76 It was also interesting the emergence in this comparative analysis of several enzymes predicted to be involved in metabolism of tyramine, histamine, histidine or tyrosine (Supplementary Table S5), these being biogenic amines that are known to be present in grape-musts and whose content increases along alcoholic fermentation.58,77 This observation suggests that the presence of H. guilliermondii (and also H. uvarum and H. opuntiae) may play a role in controlling the levels of tyramine and histamine obtained in wines counter-acting, at least in part, the production prompted by S. cerevisiae and other microbiota present in musts.58 Consistent with this idea, previous studies have reported a decrease in the level of biogenic amines produced during the early stages of wine fermentations conducted in the presence of Kloeckera apiculata, the anamorph of H. uvarum, this effect being alleviated as the fermentation proceeds and the abundance of this non-Saccharomyces yeast is reduced.78 This is a particular relevant aspect since the level of tyramine and histamine is a critical parameter determining wine quality and consumers’ health and recommended levels for the amount of these compounds that can be present in wine has been established in a variety of countries.58The comparative analysis performed also led to the identification of about 2,797 S. cerevisiae proteins for which we could not identify an orthologue in the predicted ORFeomes of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum or H. opuntiae (Supplementary Table S6). This data set of S. cerevisiae proteins absent in Hanseniaspora is enriched in proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, in nitrogen metabolism, in cell cycle, in DNA processing, in RNA synthesis, in transcriptional regulation, in protein synthesis and in intracellular trafficking (Supplementary Table S6). Consistent with the results of the metabolic reconstruction described earlier, among the S. cerevisae genes missing in the Hanseniaspora species were ICL1 encoding isocitrate lyase, PCK1, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FBP1, encoding fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, as well as the genes involved in biosynthesis of thiamine, niacin, biotin or polyamines (Supplementary Table S6). Among the large set of S. cerevisiae proteins involved in transcriptional regulation that were not found in H. guilliermondii were Msn2 and Msn4 transcription factors, essential for control of environmental stress response in the budding yeast79 (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S6). No protein showing similarity to ScMsn2 or ScMsn4 could also be identified in the genome of the other Hanseniaspora species having a genome disclosed indicating that this is a feature of the genus and not specific of the H. guilliermondii species. This observation is intriguing as it leaves open the elucidation of the mechanisms by which Hanseniaspora spp respond to environmental stress, specially taking into account that robust homologues of Msn2 and of its target genes had been identified in the genome of other wine Non-Saccharomyces species such as Z. bailii.80 The existence of a general response to stress showing similarities to the one described in the budding yeast has been characterized in distant fungal species including Lachancea kluyveri, Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe, albeit this transcriptional response was found to be mediated by regulators having little homology with ScMsn2.81–83 Thus, the absence of Msn2/Msn4 orthologues within the Hanseniaspora genus does not per se means that these yeasts will not be equipped with a general stress response. Conservation in the ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 of S. cerevisiae genes identified to be required for tolerance of this species against relevant oenological stresses. Based on results from large-scale phenotypic screenings the S. cerevisiae genes required for tolerance against high concentrations of glucose or ethanol were identified, as well, as the genes required for maximal fermentation in grape-juice medium (also called the ‘fermentome’). The predicted ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 was searched for orthologues of these determinants of stress tolerance being the number of conserved genes identified in each horizontal bar. A selected set of the conserved and non-conserved genes is also shown while the full result is available in Supplementary Table S6. Since Hanseniaspora are highly tolerant to high-glucose concentrations it was not considered of interest to specify the set of non-conserved genes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes mediating multidrug resistance are underlined. *Although Ssu1 was not identified within the set of genes belonging to the fermentome, the absence of this sulphite efflux pump in the Hanseniaspora species is also highlighted in the figure since tolerance to SO2 is generally accepted as a highly relevant trait for oenological strains.Conservation in the ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 of S. cerevisiae genes identified to be required for tolerance of this species against relevant oenological stresses.

Similar numbers were also obtained for H. uvarum or H. opuntiae (Supplementary Table S6). Among the genes found to be conserved in the Hanseniaspora species is the protein kinase Hog1 (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S6) as well as most members of the HOG-pathway indicating that this signalling pathway, essential for S. cerevisiae response to stress induced by vinification,89 is conserved in the Hanseniaspora genus. Despite this, we could not identify orthologues within the Hanseniaspora species similar to ScMsn2/ScMsn4, ScHot1 or ScSko1, the known mediators of Hog1-dependent response (Supplementary Table S6). Proteins involved in the assembly and function of the vacuolar ATPase, also identified for S. cerevisae tolerance to vinification-stress, comprised another group of proteins for which we could not identify orthologues in H. guilliermondii (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S7). Among the S. cerevisiae ethanol-resistance genes that had no orthologue in H. guilliermondii are several proteins with peroxisomal function, as well as proteins of the respiratory chain and involved in intracellular protein trafficking (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S7). It remains to be established if the absence of these genes and eventually of others mediating tolerance to ethanol in S. cerevisae contributes for the reduced tolerance of Hanseniaspora species to stressful concentrations of ethanol. An interesting observation that emerged from this comparative analysis was the absence within the three Hanseniaspora species examined of an orthologue for the sulphite efflux pump Ssu1, an essential determinant of S. cerevisiae tolerance to SO2, which is in line with the observed low resilience of these species to SO2-stress in the phenotypic screening shown in Fig. 2 and also reported before.8Overall, the comparative genomic analysis herein performed shows significant differences in the way by which S. cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora spp respond to environmental stress and, in particular, in the response to relevant stresses in the context of wine fermentation with emphasis on the toxicity imposed by high concentrations of ethanol. The release of the genomic sequence of H. guilliermondii as well as the annotation and the comparative analysis herein presented also focusing H. opuntiae and H. uvarum is expected to contribute for a better elucidation of the physiology and biology of these species, essentially by boosting gene and genomic functional analyses. Necessarily, the results of this research will foster the design (or re-design) of Hanseniaspora strains to be used not only in wine-making but also in other relevant biotechnological industrial processes, such as production of aroma compounds, where these species have been identified as potentially interesting cell-factories.90,91This work was financed by FEDER through POCI-COMPETE 2020 and by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (BI/PTDC/AGR-TEC/3315/2014_2016, Project SMARTWINE-‘Smarter win fermentations: integrating omic-tools for development of novel mixed-starter cultures for tailoring wine production’), and supported by FCT to Biosystems and Integrative Sciences Institute (BioISI; FCT/UID/Multi/04046/2013) and to iBB-Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences (through contract UID/BIO/04565/2013).

IntroductionGenomic imprinting results in parent-of-origin expression of genes and controls normal development and maternal behaviour.1–3 Disruption of imprinting leads to developmental defects in humans.4 Imprinting occurs in both groups of therian mammals, the eutherians and marsupials, but there is, as yet, no evidence for imprinting in monotremes.5,6 DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine; 5 mC) is the best known epigenetic mark that plays a critical role in genomic imprinting and regulates retrotransposon activity.7,8 This DNA modification is catalysed by the well characterized DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) family of enzymes including DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT3L.9–11 The DNMT3 family is present in eutherians, marsupials and all non-mammalian vertebrates examined so far.5,12 DNMT3L has no catalytic domain but it is needed to establish DNA methylation.13–15 It is thought to act as a cofactor with other DNMT3 family members to establish DNA methylation and genomic imprinting.16,17Genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation can be observed during both gametogenesis and early embryogenesis in mammals.11 These changes are mediated by a global re-methylation following demethylation known as epigenetic reprogramming. In early embryogenesis, demethylation is necessary for acquisition of totipotency.18–22 Gametogenesis requires global demethylation to ensure the erasure of parent-specific imprinting.7,23 This allows resetting of sex-specific imprinting marks in the male and female germ cells.2,7,23 Most of our understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is based on studies in mice, but much less is known about this in marsupials. In mice there is only a short pre-natal period when germ cells proliferate, but in marsupials there is an extended period of post-natal development. In the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, germ cells continue proliferation for at least 25 days after birth before beginning to enter meiotic and mitotic arrest,24,25 giving an extended window of time in which to examine the relative roles of the somatic environment versus intrinsic germ cell programming in controlling the imprinting. Using a marsupial that diverged from eutherian mammals over 160 Mya to highlight the similarities and dissimilarities in the epigenetic control of germ cell maturation and epigenetic reprogramming can provide new understanding of the evolution and control of mammalian epigenetic processes. As yet, just one gene, H19, has been examined for epigenetic reprogramming of germ cells. This study established that the sequence of events and the relative timing of epigenetic reprogramming of H19 in males is conserved between these mammals.26 However, genome-wide changes in methylation levels in either sex of marsupials are still unknown.In this study, we hypothesized that germ-line methylation is an intrinsic and conserved property of mammalian germ cells and is independent of germ cell migration, proliferation or absolute time of birth. We also hypothesized that the timing of 5 mC emergence and DNMT3L expression coincides with critical stages of germ cell development and maturation and not with the time of birth. To test these hypotheses, we examined the timing of 5 mC emergence in marsupial male and female germ cells and measured the gene expression and localization patterns of DNMT3L in developing tammar gonads of both sexes throughout the duration of their post-natal development in the pouch.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and tissue collectionTammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) originally from Kangaroo Island were collected from our colony at the University of Melbourne. Post-natal samples were collected at appropriate times of postpartum (pp) and were aged based on head length growth curves.27 Pouch young (PY) smaller than 5 g are heterothermic,28 and were cooled on ice then killed by decapitation. PYs over 5 g were anaesthetized with Zoletil (Virbac, Australia) i.m. before killing by decapitation. Gonads were dissected immediately after death and one gonad was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for expression analysis and the other was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH7.4) for immunohistochemistry. All animal experimentation followed the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (2013) guidelines and were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Experimental Ethics Committees. 2.2. Immunofluorescence (IF)Extensive testing of different antibody concentrations and pre-treatments was performed on tammar tissue to optimize each antibody. The DNMT3L antibody chosen (Ab3493, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was based on the BLAST search of amino acid sequence that was specific to DNMT3L. PFA fixed samples were washed in 1×PBS and re-hydrated through an ethanol series before being embedded in paraffin. Embedded samples were serially sectioned at 6 µm on a Rotary Microtome CUT 4060 microtome (microTec Laborgeräte GmbH, Waldorf, Germany) and mounted on poly-lysine coated slides (Thermo Fisher scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Sections were de-waxed, rehydrated through an ethanol-PBS series and then incubated in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 15 min at room temperature to permeabilize the tissue. Sections of testes and ovaries of young aged between day 10 and 70 pp were then treated for 3 min with 4 M HCl, for 10 min at day 100–120 pp and for 20 min at day 200 pp to adult, then washed in PBS and treated for 1.5 min with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin in young aged day 10–25 pp, for 2 min at day 45–70 pp and for 4 min at day 100 pp–adult. Next, the sections were incubated for 1 h with 10% (w/v) horse serum diluted in PBST for blocking. After blocking, sections were incubated with primary antibody solution at 4 °C for 16 h (Table 1). For SOX9 and 5 mC double-staining, we treated sections with 4 M HCl for 10 min after boiling Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) treatment for 20 min. The following day, sections were washed three times with PBST and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 h (Table 1). Sections were washed three times with PBST again and then incubated for 10 min with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). DAPI treated sections were washed with PBST and mounted with DAKO fluorescence mounting solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). The control for all treatments was no primary antibody. These slides were treated in the same manner as described above except primary antibody treatment was omitted. Images were collected on an Olympus DP70 Microscope Digital Camera System (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies used for this studyAntibodies used for this study2.3. Quantitation of 5 mC stainingGenome-wide changes in DNA methylation levels were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF) using a DNA methylation specific antibody to 5-methylcytosine (5 mC). We also performed H&E staining using the same samples to distinguish germ cells from somatic cells on the basis of their distinctive morphology as described previously.25,29–31 Intensity of fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The intensity of 5 mC staining in germ cells was normalized to that of somatic cells in adjacent areas of the section: Sertoli cells in males and pre-granulosa/granulosa cells in females. Differences in levels of 5 mC between stages were analysed by Tukey–Kramer’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test after analysis of variance (ANOVA) with R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).2.4. Gonadal RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisSnap-frozen gonads were used for RNA extraction using the GenElute Mammalian total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was treated with the DNA free DNase treatment and removal kit (Thermo Fisher scientific, Massachusetts, USA) to remove residual genomic DNA and then used as a template for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III First strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).2.5. Sequencing of cDNA encoding the partial tammar DNMT3LA BLAST search of the new tammar genome database (Wallabase 4.0 O’Neill, Fujiyama, Heider, Renfree, Pask et al. personal communication) was performed using the mouse Dnmt3l sequence and then a putative DNMT3L gene was identified. Tammar DNMT3L specific primers were made on the basis of the putative sequence (Table 2). PCR reactions were performed using GoTaq Green master mix (Promega Corporation, USA). PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and directly sequenced (Micromon Sequencing Facility, Monash University, Clayton) using the PCR primers. Primers used for this studyPrimers used for this study2.6. Bioinformatics analysisDNA sequences of various mammalian DNMT3s (koala, grey short-tailed opossum, Tasmanian devil, mouse and human) and human DNMT2 were obtained by BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Amino acid sequences retrieved from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank/RefSeq database were used to generate a phylogenetic tree. The alignment of the translated sequences was performed by Muscle with MEGA7 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Genetic distances were calculated using the Poisson model. A phylogenetic tree of the DNMT3 family members was produced with MEGA7 using the Neighbour joining method. Accession numbers were: Phascolarctos cinereus predicted DNMT3L, RefSeq Accession XM_020995934.1; Monodelphis domestica predicted DNMT3L, RefSeq Accession XM_007493298.2; Sarcophilus harrisii predicted DNMT3L, RefSeq Accession XM_012544408.2; Mus musculus Dnmt3a, AF068625; M. musculus Dnmt3b, BC083147; M. musculus Dnmt3l, BC083147; Homo sapiens DNMT3A, AF331856; H. sapiens DNMT3B, AF176228; H. sapiens DNMT3L, BC002560 and H. sapiens DNMT2, AF045888.2.7. Reverse-transcription quantitative RT-PCRReverse-transcription quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) primers (Table 2) were designed from the known tammar partial sequence and amplified a 133 base pairs product. RT-qPCR was performed on a MX3000P (STRATAGENE, California, USA) on gonadal cDNA of both sexes from day 10 pp to adult using the SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were selected as the housekeeping genes. The DNMT3L gene expression levels were normalized to the geometric mean of the expression levels of housekeeping genes. Differences in the gene expression levels between stages were analysed by Tukey–Kramer’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test after ANOVA in R as described above.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation during spermatogenesisMale germ cells in developing testes migrated from the centre to the periphery of tubules, while Sertoli cells were always located around the periphery of tubules. In H&E and DAPI staining, nuclei of Sertoli cells had a more intense and darker staining than that of germ cells. The nuclei of germ cells were large and ovoid. The nuclei of Sertoli cells were positive for 5 mC at all developmental stages. At day 10 postpartum (pp), the intensity of 5 mC staining in germ cells was almost identical with Sertoli cells (Fig. 1A). At day 25 pp, the intensity of 5 mC in germ cells decreased so that some of germ cells were negative for 5 mC (Fig. 1B). At day 50 pp, all germ cells were stained and the intensity of 5 mC in the germ cells had increased (Fig. 1C). By day 70 pp, germ cell staining was similar to that seen at day 50 pp (Fig. 1D). From day 100 pp onwards, approx. 54% of germ cells were intensely stained (Fig. 1E). The average number of intensely stained germ cells increased by 34% at around day 200 pp (Fig. 1F).

Genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation during oogenesisFemale germ cells had large and ovoid nuclei. From day 10 pp to day 50 pp, germ cells formed germ cell nests. Somatic cell nuclei stained darker with both H&E and DAPI. DNA methylation of developing ovaries were also tested by IF with the 5 mC specific antibody. Around day 10 pp, nuclei of oogonia were more intensely stained by 5 mC antibody than those of pre-granulosa cells (Fig. 2A). From day 25 pp to day 50 pp, intensities of 5 mC staining in germ cells were similar to each other (Fig. 2B and C). At day 70 pp, several primordial follicles were observed and nuclei of oogonia were still intensely stained at this stage (Fig. 2D). Around day 120 pp, intensities of 5 mC staining in germ cells were weaker than in pre-granulosa and granulosa cells (Fig. 2E). At this stage, there was a larger number of primary follicles. Around day 200 pp, nuclei of oocytes were intensely stained by 5 mC antibody (Fig. 2F). The intensity of 5 mC in oocyte nuclei increased between day 120 and day 200 pp, and granulosa cells were also stained. In adults, there were some secondary follicles and tertiary follicles and 5 mC staining in germ cells was intense (Fig. 2G and H). 5mC localization during oogenesis.

Quantitation of DNA methylation levels during gametogenesisRegardless of sex, levels of 5 mC in late-stage germ cells were relatively high. In males during testicular differentiation, 5 mC in germ cells significantly decreased between day 10 pp and day 25 pp (P < 0.05) and then gradually increased to day 200 pp (Fig. 3A). In females during ovarian differentiation, levels of 5 mC in germ cells were constant until day 25 pp and then slowly demethylated. At that time, levels of 5 mC in somatic cells decreased slightly and there was no significant difference between stages (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although there was no significant difference in levels of 5 mC in germ cells between day 10 pp and day 70 pp, there was significant demethylation (P < 0.05) by linear regression analysis based on the ages of the individual PYs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The speed of demethylation was effectively increased in female germ cells after day 70 pp. Levels of 5mC significantly decreased between day 70 pp and day 120 (P < 0.05). Compared with day 25 pp, methylation levels in germ cells had decreased by ~36% between day 70 pp and day 120 pp. Based on the two different demethylation rates, we divided DNA demethylation into two phases, I and II. After day 120 pp when oogenesis and follicular formation was beginning, levels of 5 mC in germ cells then increased by day 200 pp (Fig. 3B). At these stages, levels of 5 mC in somatic cells were almost identical (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Quantitation of 5mC during gametogenesis.

Isolation and sequencing of the partial tammar DNMT3LOverall 1245 bp of full tammar DNMT3L candidate sequence was identified from BLAST. The tammar DNMT3L appears to be highly conserved with that of other mammals. Although we could not amplify the full coding sequence of the predicted tammar DNMT3L, a partial sequence was obtained by PCR with DNMT3L primers described in Table 2. The partial nucleotide sequence was identical with our predicted tammar DNMT3L, and the amino acid sequence included partial ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain. The amino acid sequence of predicted full tammar DNMT3L was generated (Supplementary Fig. S3), and it was 60% identical with Homo sapiens DNMT3L. Tammar DNMT3L lacks the consensus residues which are necessary for the formation of the catalytic centre of cytosine methyltransferases, similar to mouse Dnmt3l. Amino acid sequences were aligned against several DNMT3s including both human and mouse DNMT3 family members to produce a phylogenetic tree of the family members (Fig. 4). All the marsupial DNMT3Ls clustered into one branch, clearly distinct from the eutherian species such as mouse and human. Within the marsupials, the South American didelphid Monodelphis grouped with the Australian dasyurid Sarcophilus. The dasyurids are thought to be close to the ancestral Australian marsupials, from which the diprotodont species (tammar and koala, Phascolarctos) derived. The tammar DNMT3L clustered together with that of another marsupial, the koala, Phascolarctos cinereus predicted DNMT3L. DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT2 all occupy separate branches of this tree.

Gene expression patterns of tammar DNMT3L during gametogenesisDuring tammar testicular differentiation, DNMT3L gene expression was significantly up-regulated at day 40 pp (P < 0.05) and gradually down-regulated from 40 pp to adult. In adults, DNMT3L expression was low (Fig. 5A). In contrast, during ovarian differentiation DNMT3L gene expression was gradually up-regulated from day 25 pp to day 120 pp and then rapidly up-regulated from day 120 pp to adult (Fig. 5B).

Immunolocalization of tammar DNMT3LA single band was detected between 37 kDa and 50 kDa of molecular weight marker in western blotting. Thus, the predicted size of full length tammar DNMT3L is approx. 45 kDa, similar to eutherian DNMT3L. During male testicular differentiation, DNMT3L was predominantly cytoplasmic in male germ cells (Fig. 6A–D). By day 200 pp, weak DNMT3L staining was detected in the nuclei of germ cells (Fig. 6E). Interestingly, DNMT3L localized in the nuclei of germ cells and heads of spermatozoa in the adult testis (Fig. 6F). Nuclei of female germ cells stained more intensively than those of males. In the early stages, up to day 50 pp, DNMT3L was predominantly cytoplasmic in female germ cells and nuclear staining was detected in a few germ cells (Fig. 7A and B). By day 70 pp, DNMT3L staining was now predominant in the nuclei of germ cells (Fig. 7C). From day around 100 pp, DNMT3L staining in the nuclei was quite intense (Fig. 7D–F).

DiscussionGlobal DNA methylation levels in the developing germ cells in the developing tammar changed dynamically during the extended period of gametogenesis in this marsupial. In addition, the timing of methylation events differed between males and females. This correlated with sex-specific patterns for both mRNA expression and protein localization of the key DNA-methyltransferase DNMT3L. This is the first study to report the expression patterns of the DNMT3L gene in the developing gonads of any marsupial and suggests that DNA methylation-reprogramming in tammar is mediated by processes that have been highly conserved for at least 160 million years. The phylogenetic tree also suggests that the marsupial and eutherian genes had a common ancestor at the time of divergence of the therian mammals.In the tammar, most primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate to the gonadal ridge just before birth.25 Female germ cells do not begin to enter meiosis until 25 days postpartum (pp) and all have not entered meiotic arrest until around day 70 pp. Similarly, male germ cells do not enter mitotic arrest until 25 days pp and this process is also not complete until after day 70 pp.25,32 At day 10 and day 25 pp, 5 mC expression levels were similar in female germ cells, but it rapidly decreased in male germ cells between day 10 and day 25 pp. Rapid PGC proliferation occurs in both sexes at this stage24 so it is possible that DNA replication-dependent passive demethylation was operative at this time in males but not in females. During mouse spermatogenesis, genome-wide demethylation occurs during PGC migration and is complete before mitotic arrest.33 Tammar male germ cells also showed genome-wide demethylation before mitotic arrest, indicating that the relative timing of demethylation during spermatogenesis is conserved between the mouse and tammar. DNA methylation levels in male germ cells rapidly increased from day 25 pp to day 200 pp. Male germ cells enter mitotic arrest from day 25 pp.32 During mouse spermatogenesis, DNA re-methylation begins during mitotic arrest,33 similar to the tammar. Before oocyte growth, mouse female germ cells have very low levels of DNA methylation.34 In the female tammar, rapid loss of DNA methylation was detected between day 70 pp and day 120 pp, before oocyte growth and ovarian maturation, when the methylation level was significantly lower than other stages. Thereafter, DNA methylation levels rapidly increased between day 120 pp and day 200 pp. During tammar oogenesis, rapid oocyte growth and follicle expansion begins around day 120 and continues to day 250 pp.35 In mice, re-establishing DNA methylation also occurs during oocyte growth.34,36 Thus, the relative timing of completion of demethylation and initiation of re-methylation during oogenesis is also conserved between the tammar and mouse, but the duration is greatly extended in the tammar. The genome-wide changes in DNA methylation occurs during post-natal stages of tammar, while it occurs during the very short prenatal stages of mouse, but the patterns and relative timing of demethylation and re-methylation are identical as described above.During mouse gametogenesis, demethylation of the H19 imprinted gene locus is mediated by both active and passive mechanisms and active demethylation is necessary for the completion of imprint erasure.37 Due to the rapid development of mice, the genome-wide demethylation process is complete within a few days, making it difficult to observe the active and passive mechanisms separately. In contrast, the timing of demethylation in female germ cells is extended in the tammar. A significant but small linear decrease in 5 mC was detected between day 25 pp and day 70 pp in the female tammar. At that time, somatic 5 mC levels also decreased slightly, but there was no significant difference between the developmental stages. This data coincided with previous reports about DNA methylation of gonadal somatic cells in developing ovaries in mouse and human.38,39 Between day 70 pp and day 120 pp, when almost all germ cells have entered meiotic arrest, there was a significant demethylation. The two different demethylations observed before and after day 70 pp suggest that demethylation in female tammar germ cells occurs in two phases, I and II. The first demethylation phase occurred during germ cell proliferation and onset of meiosis when this process may be mediated by DNA replication-dependent passive demethylation. The second demethylation phase occurred after the germ cells were in meiotic arrest and before oogenesis, suggesting this process may be mediated by DNA replication-independent active demethylation mechanisms. In mice, there is an enzyme-linked active demethylation mechanism during gametogenesis,40–42 and the putative poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway may act as a candidate mechanism through transcriptional regulation and/or histone modification.37,43 We hypothesize that two demethylation phases in tammar reflects a passive phase followed by an active phase, possibly controlled by a PARP pathway.Mouse Dnmt3l is clearly involved in the re-establishment of DNA methylation patterns in the germ cells.13,15,44 However, expression patterns of other DNMT3 family members such as Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are not correlated with methylation dynamics or germline development in mice45 so it is difficult to compare the relative timing between mouse and tammar based on developmental events. Thus, from expression studies observed here, it is likely that tammar DNMT3L also has a critical role for re-establishing DNA methylation. During spermatogenesis, tammar DNMT3L was highly expressed around day 40 pp, at which time a global re-methylation occurred in male germ cells and then expression levels were gradually decreased. Similarly, mouse and rat Dnmt3l is up-regulated at the time of re-methylation and then expression levels are gradually decreased during spermatogenesis.44,46 In contrast, during tammar oogenesis, both genome-wide DNA re-methylation and up-regulation of tammar DNMT3L expression in female germ cells coincided with the time of rapid oocyte growth that occurs from day 12035 in a similar way to that in the mouse.47 In the mouse, these sex-specific expression patterns are regulated by sex-specific promoters.48 Since the expression pattern of tammar DNMT3L was similar to that of the mouse, it is likely that sex-specific promoters may be conserved between the mouse and tammar. Analysis of promoter regions of tammar DNMT3L would be interesting to discover whether the regulatory mechanisms have also been conserved though mouse Dnmt3l has some sex-specific isoforms.48Several studies report that mouse Dnmt3l localizes in the nuclei of germ cells in the perinatal testes,49,50 but tammar DNMT3L was detected predominantly as a cytoplasmic protein until the later stages of pouch life in the tammar developing testis, consistent with the greatly extended duration of post-natal development compared to that of the mouse. DNMT3L was also strongly localized in the heads of spermatozoa in the adult. During early ovarian differentiation, DNMT3L protein was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of germ cells and its nuclear localization was detected only in a few germ cells up to day 50 pp. After day 50 pp, DNMT3L became predominantly localized in the nuclei of female germ cells. During mouse oogenesis, Dnmt3l is essential for the establishment of maternal imprints and acts as an accessary protein of Dnmt3a to recruit target gene loci15,16 presumably from a nuclear location. The gene expression patterns of tammar DNMT3L corresponded to the time of re-methylation during oogenesis, and significantly the protein in germ cells was strongly nuclear at the time of re-methylation. These results suggest that tammar DNMT3L may act in the establishment of maternal imprints during oogenesis as in other mammals.Although the expression patterns of tammar DNMT3L in male germ cells corresponded with the timing of re-methylation, tammar DNMT3L was predominantly cytoplasmic in male germ cells. This raises the possibility that not only tammar DNMT3L but also other molecular machineries are necessary for re-establishing methylation in developing testes. Although mouse Dnmt3l is required for the establishment of normal paternal methylation imprints during spermatogenesis, there is some methylation present in Dnmt3l deficient male germ cells but not in female germ cells.51 Therefore, a DNMT3L-independent methylation pathway may exist in male germ cells during spermatogenesis. The present results support the idea that the DNMT3L-independent mechanism may act in re-methylation processes during spermatogenesis. Interestingly, DNMT3L changed its localization and became nuclear in adult germ cells, suggesting it might regulate methylation in later stages of spermatogenesis. Dnmt3l deficient male mice have meiotic ‘catastrophes’ during which there is reactivation of retrotransposons in the male germ cells.13 In addition, mouse Dnmt3l establishes DNA methylation not only at paternally imprinted gene loci but also at non-pericentric heterochromatic sequences and interspersed repeats, and it affects chromatic compaction in later stage testes.51 In Dnmt3l deficient adult mice, there is a loss of chromatin compaction which leads to apoptosis.51,52 Since Dnmt3l transcripts are almost absent in adults, it was assumed that there is no Dnmt3l protein in adults.13 Although the expression levels of tammar DNMT3L were very low, similar to that of mouse Dnmt3l, tammar DNMT3L was detected in the nuclei of germ cells in adults. Therefore, it is possible that tammar DNMT3L has an un-documented function which may be required for the chromatin condensation in differentiating male germ cells.Our findings clearly show that the basic mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming must have been established before the marsupial-eutherian split over 160 Mya and open new perspectives for identifying a novel active demethylation mechanism in female germ-line. In addition to these, our data point towards a major role of a key enzyme, DNMT3L, in the process of epigenetic reprogramming and gametogenesis with respect to its protein localization. Since epigenetic reprogramming in the tammar occurs over such an extended period of time and whilst the young are accessible in the mother’s pouch, further study of the marsupial will allow for more precise manipulation of the processes to elucidate the mechanisms of control.The authors thank Chris Lucas for assistance with the animals, all members of the wallaby research group for help with the animals and the dissections, and Dr. Stephen Frankenberg for assistance with the analysis of the tammar DNMT3L sequence.FundingThis study was supported by funds from the Norma Hilda Schuster (nee Swift) Scholarship from the University of Melbourne to T.I. and the School of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAspergillus flavus is a major plant pathogen that is widely distributed throughout the world. This organism is the causative agent of aspergillosis, an important zoonotic mycosis. Worldwide, A. flavus is the second leading cause of invasive and non-invasive aspergillosis.1,2 Tashiro et al. reported that about ~5% of respiratory positive Aspergillus spp. cultures in Japan are identified as A. flavus.3 However, clinical A. flavus isolates have not been sufficiently investigated, and its virulence factors remain largely unknown.Aspergillus flavus is also a well-known aflatoxin producer. Aflatoxins have serious hepatotoxic, hepatocarcinogenic, and immunosuppressive effects on humans and animals.4,5 Aflatoxigenic A. flavus is not prevalent in the environment in Japan,6 and as such, aflatoxin production in Japanese clinical A. flavus isolates has not been investigated and the genome characteristics and pathogenicity of these strains are unknown. The present study aims to determine the genome sequences and phenotypes, including pathogenicity, of A. flavus strains clinically isolated in Japan.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and preparation of conidiaThe ten strains of A. flavus used in this study (Table 1) were obtained from the Medical Mycology Research Center (MMRC), Chiba University, through the National BioResource Project (http://www.nbrp.jp (15 November 2018, date last accessed)). rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequence (ITS) or partial ß-tubulin (benA) sequence of A. flavus IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60519, IFM60655, IFM61224, and IFM61226 were analyzsed to identify as A. flavus in MMRC. Other strains might be identified as A. flavus based on the morphology. Genome sequence data for A. flavus strains NRRL33577 and Aspergillus oryzae RIB408 were used in this study. These strains were routinely cultured at 25°C for 2 weeks on potato dextrose agar, followed by conidia collection as described previously.9 We observed very little A. flavus IFM59975, IFM61224, or IFM61226 conidia formation. Recovered conidia were used in further experiments. Source of strains investigated in this studySource of strains investigated in this study2.2. Whole-genome sequencingA ZR Fungal/Bacterial DNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) was used to prepare genomic DNA from A. flavus and A. oryzae strains. Five micrograms of genomic DNA were broken into fragments of, on average, 500 bp using a Covaris S2 sonication system (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were prepared using a NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). A total of 300 cycles of paired-end sequencing were carried out using a MiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The sequencing reads were trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench ver. 6.5 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the following parameters: Phred quality score > 30; remove 15 terminal nucleotides from the 5’ end and 2 terminal nucleotides from the 3’ end; remove truncated reads less than <100 nucleotides in length. Trimmed reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench ver. 6.5 (Qiagen). Accession numbers in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive and the scaffold accession number are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Assembled scaffolds were mapped to the genome data of A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40 using MUMmer. Trimmed read data sets by ea-utils10 were mapped to the assembled scaffolds or reference genomes using Bowtie2 v.2.3.211 with ‘–very-sensitive’ option. The number of reads is shown in Supplementary Table S2. Scaffold data were analysed using b-MiGAP12; assembled scaffold numbers, total read lengths, and the number of CDS regions are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. For genome-wide phylogenetic analysis, trimmed reads including SRR1835311 as the short read of A. oryzae RIB40 were mapped to the reference genome of A. flavus NRRL3357 using Bowtie2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using samtools v. 1.813, and filtered with 10-fold coverage, 30 mapping quality, and 75% consensus using in-house scripts.14,15. Repetitive regions of A. flavus NRRL3357 identified by RepeatMasker v. open-4.0.7 (http://repeatmasker.org (15 November 2018, date last accessed)) were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. A maximum likelihood tree of 12 strains including A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40 was constructed based on 268, 510 SNPs using RAxML v. 8.2.1116 with 1, 000 bootstrap, and visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (11 July 2017, date last accessed)).2.3. Partial sequencing of a-amylase geneA partial a-amylase gene, including mismatches between the original copy and extra copies in A. oryzae, was amplified with a forward primer (5'-CTAACCATCACATAGTTGGACTATATCCAG-3'), a reverse primer (5'-GTCGGTCGGGTAGCCCGAGAGCCAGGTTGC-3'), and EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Amplified fragments were purified with FastGene Gel and a PCR Extraction Kit (NIPPON Genetics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and sequenced using a BigDye terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Prediction of gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesisSecondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster sequences were predicted using antiSMASH (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/ (21 April 2017, date last accessed)) from annotated data for non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS), PKS, dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase(DMTS), and terpene synthase. A total of 87 clusters were found (Supplementary Table S3). In 34 of the 87 clusters in A. oryzae RIB40, almost the entirety of each region was covered with reads obtained from each strain.2.5. Detection of aflatoxinTo prepare A. flavus and A. oryzae extracts, conidia were inoculated on sterilized maize grain and cultured for 4–5 days at 25°C. After cultivation, each grain covered with fungal cells was dipped into 1 ml 70% wt/vol, methanol, and secondary metabolites, including aflatoxins, were extracted by mixing vigorously. The supernatants obtained from each strain were used in the following analyses. Extract aflatoxin content was estimated using a MycoJudge Total Aflatoxin ELISA kit (NH Foods Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF) as described below. Samples were separated by LC using the Agilent 1260 infinity system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (Agilent Technologies) maintained at 40°C. Ammonium acetate (5 mM) (A) and methanol (B) were used as mobile phases. Each 3 µLµl sample was separated with LC, using a gradient of 10% A/90% B to 100% B over 30 min with a flow rate of 0.2 mLml/min. The Agilent 6550 iFunnel QTOF LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies) was used for MS analysis.2.6. Detection of ustiloxin B by LC-MS/MSThe procedures used to prepare extracts and detect ustiloxin B produced by each strain are the same as those used for aflatoxin detection, as described above. Because we could not obtain a standard sample of ustiloxin B, we used an estimation based on the measured accurate mass of the protonated molecular ion [M + +H]+ that indicated relative mass errors within ± 2 ppm and high isotope scores (> 85%).2.7. Visualization of sequence dataSequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA7.17 The Integrative Genomic Viewer18, 19 (Broad Institute) was used to search the mapped reads and scaffolds of reference genomes. J-Circos (Australian Prostate Cancer Research Centre)20 was used to visualize the mapped reads for each strain. The Artemis Comparison Tool (Sanger Institute) was used for visualization by synteny plot.213. Results and discussion3.1. Mapping of A. flavus data on the reference genomes of A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40The read data from each clinical isolate of A. flavus were mapped to A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357 reference genome data and scaffolds of ten  A. flavus strains. Mapping rates are shown in Table 2. Mapped reads on A. oryzae RIB40 chromosomes were visualized with J-Circos,20 as shown in Fig. 1. Some large gaps were found compared with A. oryzae RIB40. Additional notes about large gaps are included in the Supplementary Text. Mapping of reads to scaffold and reference genomeaThe sequence reads of the isolates were mapped onto their scaffolds as well as onto the genome sequence of RIB40, and the percentages of successful mapping are shown. The highest mapping (black cells) and the second highest mapping (grey cells) are indicated.Mapping of reads to scaffold and reference genomeaThe sequence reads of the isolates were mapped onto their scaffolds as well as onto the genome sequence of RIB40, and the percentages of successful mapping are shown.

Solid circles indicate putative centromeres and centripetal solid lines on the outermost grey circle indicate chromosome boundaries.Phylogenic analysis was performed based on identified 268, 510 SNPs, which indicated ten strains used in this study were roughly divided into three groups (Fig. 2). Aspergillus flavus NRRL3357 was grouped in a same group with A. flavus IFM55053, IFM58503, and IFM61226 (Fig. 2, shaded with green). On the other hand, A. oryzae RIB40 was grouped in a same group with A. flavus IFM54693, IFM59894, IFM59975, IFM60655, and IFM61224 (Fig. 2, shaded with blue). Aspergillus flavus IFM57535 and IFM60519 were away from both groups.An unrooted phylogenetic tree of ten clinical isolates of A. flavus, along with A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40, calculated on the basis of SNPs identified. The light gray-shaded strains include A. flavus NRRL3357, while the gray-shaded ones include A. oryzae RIB40.An unrooted phylogenetic tree of ten clinical isolates of A. flavus, along with A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40, calculated on the basis of SNPs identified. The light gray-shaded strains include A. flavus NRRL3357, while the gray-shaded ones include A. oryzae RIB40.More unmapped reads were observed in A. flavus IFM54693 than in the other strains (Table 2). One possible reason for this is that the total scaffold length of A. flavus IFM54693 was shortest of all ten strains and ~1.5 Mb shorter than the average of the other nine strains. A possible cause of short total scaffold length is that scaffolds smaller than 1 kb were not included in this analysis. The impaired region, therefore, might be a cause of reads unmapped to the strain’s own scaffold and to those of other strains. Additionally, many unmapped reads were across two different scaffolds (data not shown). Consistent with this finding, most unmapped reads were mapped on strains’ own scaffolds using the ‘local’ option in Bowtie2 (which improved the mapping rate from 74.90% to 96.16%), suggesting that A. flavus IFM54693 has some rearrangement regions, which could be a cause of the low mapping rate. Further investigation using long-read sequence technologies is warranted to determine the precise reason for many unmapped A. flavus IFM54693 reads.3.2. Comparison of strains by molecular phylogenetic analysis of cmdAPartial gene sequences of ß-tubulin (benA), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2), and a calmodulin gene (cmdA) similar to the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1–5.8S-ITS2 region) have been used as molecular identification markers to distinguish species, and the calmodulin gene has been proposed as a secondary identification marker.22 The partial benA and rpb2 genes of the ten  A. flavus strains used in this study were identical or had single base substitutions compared with the sequences of A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40. The partial cmdA sequences were more diverse than those of benA or rpb2 among the ten strains. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the ten strains could be divided into three groups (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the findings of Okoth et al.23Molecular phylogenic analysis of partial cmdA sequences by the maximum likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model.37 The tree with the highest log likelihood (-817.8602) is shown. The number at each of the branch points indicates percentage of association of the clustered sequences listed. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying neighbour-joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood approach and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete <U+03B3> distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites [5 categories (+G, parameter = 0.0500)]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths based on the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 20 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 516 positions in the final data set.

Two clinical isolates possess one or two extra copies of the a-amylase geneAspergillus oryzae RIB40 possesses one original a-amylase gene and two extra identical a-amylase gene copies.8 On the other hand, A. flavus NRRL3357 has only an original a-amylase gene. Three nucleotide mismatches have been identified between the original a-amylase gene and the two extra a-amylase copies.24 To detect the extra a-amylase copies, we performed sequencing a partial region of a-amylase genes. As shown in Fig. 4, the 791st nucleotide residue of A. flavus NRRL3357, indicating that the strain did not contain extra a-amylase copies (Fig. 4, top). No clinical isolates, except A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655, included these mismatches, suggesting that they do not possess the extra a-amylase copies found in the A. oryzae RIB40 strain. On the other hand, A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655 showed thymine and cytosine peaks at the 791st nucleotide residue in the a-amylase gene (Fig. 4). As consistent with that, we found reads possessing thymine or cytosine at the residue of both strains. The peak heights of the thymine and cytosine nucleotides of A. flavus IFM60655 were similar each other, suggesting that an extra a-amylase gene was presence in the genome of A. flavus IFM60655 similarly to A. oryzae NBRC30105.24 On the other hand, the thymine peak was higher than the cytosine peak at the same site in A. flavus IFM54693 similar to A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 4), suggesting that A. flavus IFM54693 has two extra a-amylase copies. As shown in Fig. 2, A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655 are phylogenetically close to A. oryzae RIB40, suggesting that these strains might be classified as A. oryzae. Although A. flavus IFM59975 is also included in a group with A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655, the strain did not possess extra a-amylase gene, suggesting that A. flavus IFM59975 is closer to native strain in Japan than the other extra-a-amylase acquired strains or lose extra a-amylase genes spontaneously.Sanger sequencing revealed a difference between the original and a secondary a-amylase gene.Sanger sequencing revealed a difference between the original and a secondary a-amylase gene.3.4. Most clinical isolates possess the RIB40-type aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusterThe clusters homologous to the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster in ten clinical isolates were compared with those of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357. As shown in Fig. 5, the region from fas-1 to norB could clearly be divided into three groups: A. flavus NRRL3357-type, A. oryzae RIB40-type, or another group including A. flavus IFM59894 and IFM60655. The clusters from hypA to norB in A. flavus IFM57535 and IFM60519 are nearly identical to those in A. oryzae RIB40. Those strains were separated from each other in the phylogenetic (Fig. 2). The clusters in A. flavus IFM54693, IFM59975, and IFM61224 are highly similar to those in A. oryzae RIB40 in the region from avnA to norB, and these strains were included in a group with A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the A. flavus IFM61226 cluster from hypA to norB is highly similar to that of A. flavus NRRL3357. The A. flavus IFM58503 cluster and the A. flavus IFM55053 show high identity from ver-1 to norB and hypA to aflR in the A. flavus NRRL3357 aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster, respectively. As shown in phylogenetic analysis based on SNPs, those A. flavus strains, IFM55053, IFM58503, and IFM61226 were included in a group with A. flavus NRRL3357 (Fig. 2). The clusters in IFM55053, IFM59894, and IFM60655 are partially deleted (Fig. 5).Comparison of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters.

Dotted lines corresponding to the region containing cypA and norB indicate a 612-base deletion including the start codons for cypA and norB.As shown by Tominaga et al.25 and Kiyota et al.,26 some of the genes that differ between A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357 play roles in aflatoxin production. In A. oryzae RIB40, AflT has a large deletion of the C-terminal region due to a TC nucleotide insertion. All of the A. flavus strains, except IFM58503 and IFM61226, also have the AflT C-terminal deletion, as does A. oryzae RIB40. In norA of A. oryzae RIB40, a frameshift mutation was reported to be the cause of truncation.25 Among A. flavus clinical strains, this frameshift mutation was not found. The intergenic region and 5’-coding sequences of cypA and norB, which are deleted in A. oryzae strains, including RIB40 and several A. flavus strains,25,27 are retained in A. flavus IFM58503, IFM61226, and NRRL3357. AflJ is an aflatoxin pathway regulator that binds to another regulator, AflR,28 to cooperatively regulate genes in the aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster.26,29 Kiyota et al. reported that AflJ in A. oryzae had four unique amino acid substitutions as compared with A. flavus strains, indicating that these substitutions induce inactivation of AflJ.26 As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, A. flavus IFM54693, IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60519, and IFM61224 share four amino acids with A. oryzae RIB40 at the 8th, 22nd, 268th, and 354th nucleotide residues of AflJ, suggesting that AflJ is inactivated in those strains.Production of aflatoxin or its intermediates were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mass spectrometry. Consistent with grouping with the region from fas-1 to norB, aflatoxins were not detected in the extracts from the strains with an RIB40-type cluster (Fig. 5). In A. flavus IFM58503 extracts, two aflatoxin intermediates, sterigmatocystin and O-methylsterigmatocystin (OMST), were detected by mass spectrometry (data not shown). OMST is converted into aflatoxin B1 and G1 by OrdA. OrdA of A. flavus IFM58503 has an A110E substitution, which is conserved among A. flavus NRRL3357, A. oryzae RIB40, and nine other isolates. Because the amino acid is also conserved among OrdA homologues in Aspergillus ochraceoroseus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus nomius, the mutation might contribute to the non-aflatoxigenicity of the strain. Aflatoxin B1 was detected in A. flavus IFM61226 extracts by mass spectrometry but not by ELISA (data not shown). The aflatoxin production of A. flavus IFM61226 was significantly lower than that of A. flavus NRRL3357, suggesting that some factors inside or outside of the A. flavus IFM61226 cluster affect production.Aflatoxin production was not detected in the studied strains, except in A. flavus IFM61226. This result reflects the prevalence of non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus in the environment in Japan. Aspergillus flavus IFM61226 possesses an aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster sequence highly similar to that of A. flavus NRRL3357. Aspergillus flavus IFM55053, IFM59894, and IFM60655 have lost a part of this cluster, as shown in Fig. 5. Although A. flavus IFM54693, IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60519, and IFM61224 possess the entire cluster region, aflatoxin production was impaired in these strains. The clusters in these strains show high identity with A. oryzae RIB40 suggesting that the substitutions identical to A. oryzae RIB40 are the cause of the loss of aflatoxin production in these strains.3.5. RIB40-type sesquiterpene cluster is prevalent among A. flavus clinical isolatesNext, we focussed on the sesquiterpene cluster described by Gibbons et al.30 This cluster differed markedly between A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357.30 All A. oryzae strains and three of eight A. flavus strains are reported to carry the ‘9-gene cluster’ allele.30 In contrast, other A. flavus strains, including NRRL3357, contain the ‘6-gene cluster’ allele. The clusters of the ten clinical isolates investigated in this study were divided into 3 groups. Seven of the ten strains maintained a 9-gene cluster similar to that of A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 6). No 6-gene clusters were found among the ten A. flavus strains. Aspergillus flavus IFM59975 retained the longest cluster among the studied clinical isolates. In comparison with A. flavus IFM59975, the A. flavus IFM55053 and IFM58503 clusters lacked the region containing AFL2G_05186, AFL2G_05187, and AFL2G_05186 genes (Fig. 7). These three strains retained a unique region in the cluster. Analysis using Augustus (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/(9 March 2018, date last accessed)) predicted a large gene in the unique region (Supplementary Fig. S2). Preliminary transcriptomic analysis of A. flavus IFM58503 showed that the region was transcribed to mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3). Three protein sequences of those predicted genes are highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. S4). BLAST homology analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4) identified an ankyrin repeat protein in A. parasiticus (accession number: KJK61165) and a hypothetical protein in Aspergillus bombycis (accession number: OHM48268).Phylogenetic analysis of sesquiterpene biosynthesis gene clusters in 13 nucleotide sequences containing a total of 14,081 positions.

The unique regions shared by IFM55053, IFM58503, and IFM59975 are hatched.Seven of the ten isolates were classified as carrying a 9-gene cluster allele comparable to that of A. oryzae RIB40. Interestingly, three A. flavus strains possessing the 9-gene cluster allele, SRRC1357, SRRC2112, and SRRC2524 described by Gibbons et al.30 were of Eurasian origin. Together with their data, our findings suggest that the 9-gene cluster, but not the 6-gene cluster, are prevalent in Eurasia and Japan. Three strains share a unique region that encodes a hypothetical protein homologous to an Ankyrin repeat protein. The products of these clusters remain unknown. The cluster that includes a unique gene is expected to produce a novel sesquiterpene. Further investigation is warranted to identify the product.3.6. Intergenic region between ustT and ustR is conserved in all studied clinical strainsThe ustiloxin biosynthesis gene cluster was found in all clinical A. flavus isolates. Ustiloxin, originally found as a secondary metabolite of Ustilaginoidea virens, inhibits microtubule assembly.31,32 Umemura et al. have identified a gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of ustiloxin B in A. flavus.33,34 As shown previously,33 the intergenic region between ustT and ustR is absent in A. oryzae RIB40, which leads faults in ustiloxin B production. Our sequence data indicate that the intergenic region is retained in all strains. Transcriptomic analysis of A. flavus IFM58503, a strain confirmed by mass spectrometry to be involved in ustiloxin B production, indicated that ustR transcription starts about ~200 bp upstream of the start codon (data not shown). This region is missing in the A. oryzae RIB40 genome, suggesting that the absence of ustiloxin B production in this strain is induced during domestication and causes the fault in ustR transcription.3.7. Other clusters and regions showing important differences between A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40Nine regions with clear differences between A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357 are listed in Table 3. AFL2G_11806 and AFL2G_04006 are NRPS in cluster #34 and PKS in cluster #52, respectively. These genes are found in neither the ten clinical isolates nor A. oryzae RIB40. A ~23 kb region containing cluster #34 of A. flavus NRRL3357 was not found in the ten clinical isolates or in A. oryzae RIB40. Instead, A. oryzae RIB40 and the ten clinical isolates have a shared region. In cluster #52, a ~13 kb region was found in neither the ten clinical isolates nor in A. oryzae RIB40. Cluster #49 is known as a homologue of the 10, 11-dehydrocurvularin biosynthetic cluster in A. terreus35 and was not found in A. oryzae RIB40. The cluster is located in the telomeric region of the left arm of chromosome 3 (Supplementary Fig. S5a). Two PKS genes, afcurS2 and afcurS1, are encoded by the cluster.35 All strains except for A. flavus IFM60655 retained these genetic regions (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Among these, the A. flavus IFM57535, IFM58503, and IFM61226 clusters were highly conserved compared with that of A. flavus NRRL3357 (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Half or more strains did not retain the A. flavus NRRL3357-unique region in four other clusters, except in cluster #75, as shown in Table 3. Additionally, ~63 and ~19 kb regions were retained in only one and two clinical strains, respectively. On the other hand, some A. oryzae RIB40-specific regions were found on the genome. A ~25 kb region, including an NRPS AO090026000585, (cluster #61) was only found in A. flavus IFM54693. On chromosome 8 of A. oryzae RIB40, reads from each strain were mapped infrequently to a ~300-kb region from AO090010000234 to AO090010000317, which was also not found in A. flavus NRRL3357. Those differences might become a factor of strain individuality.

Conclusive remarksThis study provides the genome sequences of A. flavus isolated from clinical specimens in Japan. The phylogenetic analysis based on identified SNPs showed that five of the ten isolates were grouped with A. oryzae RIB40, while other 3 isolates with A. flavus NRRL3357. Two isolates, A. flavus IFM57535 and IFM60519, were placed between the two groups. To distinguish between A. flavus and A. oryzae is difficult by partial sequencing of regions such as ITS. As shown in the review by Frisvad36, A. oryzae is a domesticated strain of A. flavus. The fact that A. flavus IFM59975, IFM59894, and IFM61224 were grouped with A. oryzae RIB40 in phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are likely to be wild forms of A. oryzae in Japan and perhaps the causative agent of aspergillosis.Specimens isolated through the oral cavity, such as gingival and sputum samples, may possess the risk of contamination of oral fungi, because ‘koji’-based foods are commonly consumed in Japan and might result in contamination in oral specimens. As discussed previously, the presence of multiple copies of a-amylase is a common characteristic of A. oryzae24.oryzae.24 Although A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655 have previously been identified as A. flavus based on the ITS sequences, those strains might be reclassified as domesticated A. oryzae because of their possession of multiple a-amylase genes. The difference in sequence between the original and additional copies of a-amylase genes would be useful to discriminate between the wild and domesticated strains.In summary, the genome data obtained in this study will be useful for further analysis of the genomes of clinical isolates of A. flavus and A. oryzae obtained from oversea and Japanese environments. The phylogenetic analysis based on SNPs might enable us to differentiate between A. flavus and A. oryzae.We would like to thank the editor for his valuable suggestions to improve expressions in our manuscript.
