IntroductionPerennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is one of the most widely cultivated grass species in Europe. It is of interest for grazing, hay and silage production as it has a long growing season, and relatively high yield and nutritive value. Because of its outbreeding nature, individual plants are highly heterozygous and the diploid perennial ryegrass genome is highly heterogeneous both within and across breeding populations and wild accessions. As genomic variation forms the foundation of phenotypic variation, revealing DNA sequence variation within the genepool is important for genetic analysis and development of breeding applications.1Several studies used a candidate gene-based approach to associate sequence polymorphisms with phenotypic variation. Examples include the association of Late embryogenesis abundant 3 (LEA3) with drought tolerance,2,Brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) with shoot morphology,3,Gibberellic acid insensitive (GAI) with organ growth,4,Heading date 1 (HD1) with carbohydrate content5 and Flowering locus T (FT) with flowering time.5–7 While these studies show the power of testing gene–trait associations, the limited number of genes per study was mostly due to the high cost of genotyping at the time. However, this approach is not amenable to study complex traits related to plant development and phenology, which are typically regulated by the interaction of many genes. Therefore, we need versatile and cost-efficient methods to characterize the genetic variation in parallel for hundreds of candidate genes and hundreds of genotypes. This enables breeders to perform higher resolution screening of genetic diversity in their material and link genotypic and phenotypic variation.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most prevalent type of genomic variation and are convenient molecular markers. Two complementary SNP genotyping arrays are available for high-throughput screening in perennial ryegrass.8,9 These arrays target SNPs in genic regions, but do not allow discovery of new sequence variants. In contrast, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) allows for simultaneous discovery of genome-wide SNPs and genotyping of a large number of individuals or pools, thereby avoiding ascertainment bias. Therefore, GBS has broad applications in plant breeding and genetics studies, including linkage maps, genome-wide association studies, genomic selection and genomic diversity studies.10 Only short fragments (range about 100–300 bp) are sequenced and there is no a priori control over which genes are tagged. In combination with a local short linkage disequilibrium that is typical for an outbreeding species as L. perenne,3,11 it can be very difficult to identify SNPs that are causal for the phenotype of interest.The large size of the L. perenne genome (2 Gbp) and high repetitive sequence content (76%)12 currently precludes whole genome sequencing at sufficient depth in hundreds of accessions as has been done in e.g. Arabidopsis, rice and soybean. To study trait genetics in forage and turf grasses, we identified hundreds of candidate genes in genetic pathways that control plant development and quality traits, and analysed their genome sequence using probe capture enrichment for targeted resequencing in a large germplasm collection of 736 genotypes. We specifically focussed on genes involved in pathways related to interesting agronomic traits, such as plant growth and architecture (important for biomass yield), development and transition to flowering (important for seasonal control of growth), cell wall biogenesis (important for digestibility) and phytohormone biosynthesis, signalling and response [including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellic acid and strigolactones]. Identifying sequence variants in these genes provides insights in the range of naturally occurring genomic diversity that can be expected in gene-rich regions of the genome. The variants can be used as markers for association genetics studies (as previously described for LEA3, BRI1, GAI, HD1 and FT3), and/or to identify alleles with altered amino acid sequence, mRNA splicing or mRNA stability, hence altered gene function or regulation possibly resulting in an altered physiology and thereby affecting the phenotype.Multiple bioinformatics methods are available to identify sequence variants using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, but defining a complete and reliable variant set remains difficult. De novo discovery of genomic polymorphisms commonly relies on mapping reads to a single reference genome sequence. Although the GATK best practices are the most commonly used variant calling (VC) pipeline, there is no single best VC pipeline available with both good sensitivity and precision. Moreover, there is low concordance between VC pipelines, even with the same input data.13–16 In addition, each VC pipeline returns different variant annotations that can be used for quality filtering. Choosing the appropriate filtering criteria and thresholds [for instance, minimum read depth (RD)] is not straightforward as NGS data typically has a non-uniform distribution of coverage17 and estimated quality values may be dataset dependent so that optimal settings need to be calibrated for each dataset. The high density of sequence polymorphisms in the germplasm collection with respect to the L. perenne genome sequence could also hamper variant identification. More divergent alleles could contain the most interesting genomic variation, but are also the most difficult to detect as reads that are highly divergent from the reference genome may fail to map if the parameters for short read alignment are too stringent.18 Hence, if capture and/or mapping efficiency of highly divergent sequences precludes their detection, it is to be expected that routine workflows of mapping and VC lead to an underestimation of the genetic diversity at highly divergent regions, a known problem in genome resequencing studies.19Here, we present the identification and annotation of 503 L. perenne orthologues of known genes that regulate plant growth and development. These genes were resequenced in a germplasm collection of 736 genotypes to describe the genomic variation in L. perenne. Two complementary strategies were used to obtain a reliable and complete catalogue of genomic variation. First, four VC pipelines were compared and automatically integrated to reach maximal sensitivity. The influence of mapping algorithms was assessed and hard filtering was compared with precision-based filtering to reach sufficient specificity. Additionally, an alternative strategy consisting of de novo assembly followed by overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) clustering was used to circumvent read mapping bias and to construct alternative alleles for each gene. This reference independent allele reconstruction is particularly important for gene families with highly divergent alleles. We demonstrated the benefit of this approach for LpSDUF247 and identified 28 novel alleles that were not detected using traditional VC pipelines. This approach is broadly applicable to other highly heterozygous outbreeding species. Finally, we used all this information to create a comprehensive catalogue of functionally annotated genetic variation across many pathways that control growth, development and agricultural traits.2. Materials and methods2.1 Candidate gene identification and manual curationGene families of A. thaliana candidate genes were identified using the comparative genomics platform PLAZA 3.0 Monocots.20,Brachypodium distachyon family members were used to identify homologous loci in the draft genome sequence of L. perenne12 using BLASTx analysis (E-value 10e-5). At each L. perenne locus, predicted protein sequences were added to the corresponding PLAZA 3.0 Monocots gene family. Using protein sequences of all gene family members of A. thaliana, B. distachyon and L. perenne, a phylogenetic tree was built with MUSCLE (v3.8.31)21 and PhyML22 using default settings, and for each A. thaliana candidate gene the closest orthologous L. perenne gene was selected for further manual curation. The L. perenne gene models were evaluated using multiple protein sequence alignments with MUSCLE using orthologous proteins from B. distachyon, O. sativa, Z. mays and S. bicolor according to PLAZA 3.0 Monocots. Additional RNA-seq data23–25 mapped with TopHat (v2.0.13)26 using default settings, was used to refine gene models and delineate untranslated regions, or to design a new gene model if required (Supplementary Data S1).2.2 Probe design, library construction and sequencingThe coding strand of each of the 503 target regions (gene model and 1,000 bp upstream promoter region) was tiled with 120 bp probes, starting every 40 bp using OligoTiler.27 Probes showing high sequence similarity to non-targets, other probes, repetitive sequences, mitochondrial or chloroplast sequences, or with extreme GC content (<25% or >65%) were removed. Finally, 57,693 SureSelect probes of 120 bp (Agilent) were retained, covering 2.3 Mb of the intended 2.8 Mb target region, at around 3× tiling.Genomic DNA was extracted from freeze-dried leaf material from 736 L. perenne genotypes representing current cultivars, breeding material and wild accessions using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method.28 DNA concentration was measured using the Quantus double-stranded DNA assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For each genotype, an indexed shotgun sequencing library was prepared from 100 ng DNA by (i) Adaptive Focused Acoustic fragmentation on a Covaris S2 instrument (Covaris, Inc.), (ii) adapter ligation and (iii) magnetic bead purification using an adapted protocol of Uitdewilligen et al.29 The libraries were pooled without normalization into eight pools, each containing 96 libraries of individual genotypes. Each pool was used for a probe capture hybridization reaction according to the SureSelect protocol (Agilent SureSelectXT2 Target Enrichment for Illumina Paired-End Sequencing Library Protocol, v. 1.0). After PCR amplification of purified enriched pooled libraries, each pool of 96 libraries was sequenced on one lane of a HiSeq2000 instrument using 2 × 91 PE sequencing (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The raw data is available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject PRJNA434356, Accessions SRR6812717–SRR6813075).2.3 Read mapping and variant callingRaw reads were trimmed and quality filtered by Trimmomatic (v0.32)30 and mapped onto the draft perennial ryegrass genome sequence12 with default settings of BWA-MEM (version 0.7.8-r455)31 and GSNAP (version 2016-09-23).32 Duplicate reads were marked using Picard-tools (release 1.113). Local realignment around indels was performed according to the best practices workflow of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (v.3.7).36,37 RD and coverage were calculated on the resulting BAM files using BEDTools (v2.25.0).33Four different VC pipelines were used: SAMtools (version 1.2-115-gb8ff342),34 Freebayes (v1.0.2-2-g7ceb532),35 GATK Unified Genotyper (GATK UG) and GATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK HC).36,37 Multi-allelic variants were removed using VCFtools (v0.1.14).38 For hard filtering, a custom Python script was used to remove variant positions and genotype calls with a RD lower than 6 and a genotype quality (GQ) lower than 30. SNPs and indels were automatically integrated by the VMC (v1.0),39 in 10 and 2 partitions, respectively. The estimated precision (EP) was calculated using a custom Python script based on the formulas given in Gézsi et al.39 The concordance of SNP and indel sets identified by four VC pipelines was determined using information in the INFO field of the VCF file returned by VMC and visually represented using Upset,40 before and after precision-based filtering (EP > 80%). Functional effects of sequence variants were predicted with SnpEff (version 4.3T).41 To validate consistency of genotype calls in an F1 segregating population, Mendelian inheritance errors (MIE) were defined after precision-based filtering (EP > 80%) using PLINK (v1.90b2t), for two parents and their F1 progeny of 29 individuals. Variants with a missing genotype call in either one of the parents were excluded from analysis, as were MIEs derived from a missing genotype call in one of the 29 F1 progeny.2.4 Hi-Plex amplicon sequencingTo generate an independent variant set, 78 genotypes were selected for resequencing of 171 amplicon regions of 80–140 bp. Of these, 147 amplicons overlap with 28 candidate genes. Primers were designed with Primer342 and divided into two highly multiplex (Hi-Plex) PCR-reactions according to their amplification efficiency (Supplementary Data S4). DNA was extracted using the CTAB method28 and DNA concentration was measured using the Quantus double-stranded DNA assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Per sample, the final DNA concentration was adjusted to 40 ng/µl and the amplicons were PCR-amplified while adding sample specific indices. Libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep PCR-free Kit according to manufacturer directions (Kapa Biosystems, USA). Hi-Plex amplification reactions and library preparations were done by Floodlight Genomics LLC (Knoxville, TN, USA). The libraries were sequenced with 2 × 150 PE on a HiSeq3000 instrument (OMRF, Oklahoma City, OK, USA). Paired-end reads were merged with PEAR (v0.9.8)43 and adapter sequences were removed. The read data is available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject PRJNA437219, Accessions SRR6813540–SRR6813585). BWA-MEM was used for read mapping, and VC was done by running the four VC pipelines. Bi-allelic variants were extracted using VCFtools and combined by VMC and the EP was calculated as described above.2.5 Identification of divergent alleles of LpSDUF247Per genotype, all reads were used for De Bruijn Graph assembly without scaffolding (CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5.3, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com (date last accessed 14 september 2018)). Contigs of at least 200 bp were retained and mapped onto the reference genome with BWA-MEM using default parameters, to group all contigs of the 736 genotypes per candidate gene. Per candidate gene, sequences of overlapping allelic fragments were extracted from the BAM files using BEDtools and clustered with the OLC assembler CAP3 (version date 02/10/15).44 Singlet sequences returned by CAP3 were removed from further analysis. All resulting alleles are assigned to their respective candidate gene and are available as (Supplementary Data S5), allowing the reader to repeat the analyses described below for any other candidate gene.One of the candidate genes of the 503 gene set, LpSDUF247, is known to be highly polymorphic and was selected to demonstrate in-depth reconstruction of divergent alleles. The 34 contigs of LpSDUF247 were aligned using MUSCLE and six highly similar sequences (>98% identity) were removed. The reference gene model of LpSDUF247 was projected onto the contigs using GenomeThreader (v 1.6.6)45 to identify CDS regions (Supplementary Data S6) and corresponding protein sequences (Supplementary Data S7).All B. distachyon members of the DUF247 gene family (HOM03M000101) were used in a tBLASTn search against the perennial ryegrass genome sequence, and 25 LpDUF247 genes were identified and manually annotated (Supplementary Data S8). After multiple sequence alignment of all 25 LpDUF247 protein sequences with B. distachyon and H. vulgare gene family members using MUSCLE, a phylogenetic tree was built with PhyML using 100 rounds of bootstrapping (Supplementary Fig. S5). Similarly, a phylogenetic tree was built using the reference protein sequences of LpDUF247-01, LpSDUF247, LpDUF247-03 and LpDUF247-04, the protein sequences of the LpSDUF247 alleles, and five LpSDUF247-02 alleles identified by Manzanares et al.46 (Supplementary Fig. S6).The 28 novel alleles were added to the reference genome sequence and read mapping was repeated for all 736 genotypes onto this multi-allelic reference genome. A matrix was created with the average RD per LpSDUF247 allele per genotype using BEDtools. This matrix was normalized per genotype, by dividing the RD per LpSDUF247 allele by the sum of RDs across all LpSDUF247 alleles, to identify alleles with the highest relative RD for each genotype while correcting for differences in library size and capture efficiency across the set of 736 samples.3. Results and discussion3.1 Identification, classification and curation of target genesTo identify L. perenne genes putatively involved in the regulation of plant growth and development, plant architecture, induction of flowering, cell wall biogenesis and phytohormone biosynthesis, signalling and response, we first searched the literature for Arabidopsis thaliana genes with a well-defined molecular and physiological function (Supplementary Table S1). Next, the corresponding 174 gene families were identified with the comparative genomics platform PLAZA 3.0 Monocots.20 For each of the A. thaliana candidate genes, a comprehensive list of orthologous loci in the draft genome sequence of L. perenne12 was delineated. A phylogenetic tree was built for A. thaliana and B. distachyon gene family members of the 174 PLAZA gene families, to select the closest orthologous L. perenne sequences of the candidate genes. When no clear one-to-one orthologous pairs were found due to lineage-specific gene duplication or gene loss events, the best two or three L. perenne loci were selected from the respective clades. The final selection contained 503 L. perenne candidate genes (Supplementary Table S1). For 407 of these loci, an annotated gene model was available.12 For the other 96 loci, a gene model needed to be annotated ab initio, in line with previous observations that the annotated gene space of L. perenne is 76% complete.47 The available gene models were evaluated using multiple protein sequence alignments with all their monocot gene family members according to PLAZA 3.0 Monocots. In addition, mapped RNA-seq data23–25 was used to refine gene models and delineate untranslated regions. Taken together, manual curation of 503 gene models (Supplementary Data S1), showed that previously available gene models12 were correct for 272 loci (54%) and needed small adaptations for 135 loci (27%). A completely new gene model was annotated at 96 loci (19%) using RNA-seq data. The length of the protein sequences corresponds well to that of their closest B. distachyon orthologs (Supplementary Fig. S1), showing that the 503 manually curated L. perenne gene models are of high quality (HQ). This was required to delineate regions for probe design and to correctly position variants relative to the reading frame in the CDS to functionally interpret the consequences of sequence polymorphism in the genic regions. Finally, the 503 candidate genes were assigned to biological processes based on the known function of their A. thaliana orthologs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). This HQ gene set can also be used to train and validate gene prediction algorithms to improve genome-wide gene annotation. Assignment of 503 candidate genes to pathways and distribution of high impact mutations per pathwayAssignment of 503 candidate genes to pathways and distribution of high impact mutations per pathway3.2 Design and efficacy of targeted resequencing by probe capture enrichmentFor each candidate gene, a target region was delineated spanning the curated gene model and an additional 1,000 bp upstream promoter region, as described previously.48 Probes were designed for a total length of 2.3 Mbp, corresponding to a coverage of 85% of each target region on average, as probes targeting repetitive regions were excluded (Supplementary Data S2). Targeted resequencing of 736 genotypes resulted in 3.2 million reads per genotype on average (range 20 thousand–31 million). After duplicate read removal, a mean of 1.9 million reads was retained per genotype, corresponding to a mean RD of 80× per position within the target regions. For VC analysis in heterozygous diploid species, a coverage of at least 6–10× is desirable to avoid false negative heterozygous calls.49 Saturation curves show a non-linear relationship between number of reads per library and target region coverage at a given RD threshold, as expected for probe capture enriched shotgun sequencing libraries (Fig. 1). At least 550,000 uniquely mapped reads per genotype were required to reach the probe region coverage plateau at 95% for RD = 1. Further increasing the number of reads per sample did not substantially increase probe region coverage (see Ruttink et al.48). The probe region coverage was slightly lower at higher RD thresholds (89% for RD = 6 and 85% for RD = 10 (boxplots in Fig. 1). Target region coverage per genotype. For each of the 503 candidate genes, the target region was delineated as the gene model and an additional 1,000 bp upstream promoter region. The mean fraction of the target region covered per genotype is shown in function of the number of uniquely mapped reads using BWA-MEM after duplicate removal, using different RD thresholds [RD = 1 (blue), RD = 6 (green) and RD = 10 (orange)].Target region coverage per genotype.

Read mapping algorithm BWA-MEM31 was compared to GSNAP,32 which is able to handle short and long insertions and deletions. Two alignment based VC pipelines were selected for their strength in SNP calling50: GATK Unified Genotyper (GATK UG)36,37 and SAMtools.34 Additionally, two haplotype-based VC pipelines were chosen for their strength in indel detection: GATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK HC) and Freebayes.35 We compared the resulting variant sets and assessed the performance of hard filtering to improve the precision of variant sets. Finally, the four individual variant sets and corresponding variant quality annotations were merged by the VMC,39 allowing for precision-based filtering as an alternative to hard filtering.3.4 Influence of read mapping algorithms and variant calling pipelinesFor each VC pipeline, the similarity of SNP and indel sets identified using BWA-MEM or GSNAP mappings was calculated using the Jaccard Index (Fig. 2). The similarity of SNPBWA and SNPGSNAP sets was lowest for Freebayes (0.73) and highest for SAMtools (0.83). The similarity of indelBWA and indelGSNAP sets was lower than that of SNPBWA and SNPGSNAP, independent of the VC pipeline. Jaccard index between indelBWA and indelGSNAP sets ranged from 0.47 (Freebayes) to 0.70 (GATK HC). On average, 11% of the SNPs were uniquely identified in the SNPBWA set and 9% of the SNPs were uniquely identified in the SNPGSNAP set. Likewise, on average, 17% of the indels were uniquely identified in the indelBWA set and 19% of the indels were uniquely identified in the indelGSNAP set. In summary, the choice of read mapper did not affect the SNP and indel sets as much as the choice of VC pipeline. For results presented below, only variants identified on BWA-MEM mappings are shown, as the same trend was observed for GSNAP mappings. Overlap of variant sets generated using BWA-MEM and GSNAP mappings as input for four VC pipelines. SNPs and indels were determined for 503 candidate genes in 736 genotypes for BWA-MEM and GSNAP mappings using four VC pipelines. The intersect of variants sets was calculated to determine common variants (dark grey) and uniquely identified variants using BWA-MEM mappings (light grey) or GSNAP mappings (black) as input. The Jaccard index value indicates the corresponding similarity.Overlap of variant sets generated using BWA-MEM and GSNAP mappings as input for four VC pipelines.

The number of SNPs was highest for GATK UG and SAMtools and considerably lower for Freebayes. The number of indels was at least four times lower than the number of SNPs identified by the same VC pipeline. GATK UG and GATK HC identified the highest number of indels, and SAMtools the least. The concordance of all four VC pipelines was low: only 150k SNPs (33% of the total number of SNPs identified) and 6.8k indels (5% of the total number of indels identified) were commonly identified, in line with previous reports.14Size and concordance of bi-allelic SNP and indel sets of four VC pipelines, before and after precision-based filtering. SNPs and indels were identified for 503 candidate genes in 736 genotypes using four VC pipelines and concordance was calculated for bi-allelic SNPs (a) and indels (b). Per Upset plot, the lower left panel shows the total number of variants per VC pipeline; the lower right panel shows the overlap in call sets between the four VC pipelines.

The bar graph shows the size per concordance group before (black) and after integration by VMC and precision-based filtering (EP > 80%) (light grey).3.6 Precision-based filtering is more reliable than hard filteringHard filtering on e.g. minimal RD and GQ is a commonly used strategy to improve the precision of variant sets. As expected, both number of variant positions and call rate (number of genotype calls per position across 736 genotypes) decreased by filtering on minimal RD of six and minimal GQ score of 30 (Fig. 4a and b). Notably, hard filtering did not increase the concordance between VC pipelines (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that true variants were not necessarily identified by multiple VC pipelines. These results corroborate that it is difficult to build a reliable catalogue of sequence variation using a single VC pipeline and applying hard filtering.51Effect of hard filtering and precision-based filtering on the saturation of genotype calls across the 736 genotypes. SNPs and indels were determined for 503 candidate genes in 736 genotypes using four VC pipelines and integrated using the VMC. The genotype call rate was calculated as the number of genotype calls present for each variant, over the total number of genotypes, and plotted cumulatively to estimate the genotype call saturation. This was done for bi-allelic variant sets: (a) before and (b) after hard filtering (RD > 6, GQ > 30) of the variant sets returned by the four VC pipelines and (c) before and (d) after precision-based filtering (EP > 80%) of the VMC output.Effect of hard filtering and precision-based filtering on the saturation of genotype calls across the 736 genotypes.

The unfiltered, VMC integrated probe capture variant set contained 444,222 SNPs and 132,766 indels, determined in 736 genotypes and 503 candidate genes. By ordering the variants according to their probability, an EP was calculated for each variant, which can be used for precision-based filtering. In general, variants identified by multiple VC pipelines were assigned higher EP scores. As precision in this context refers to the number of true called variants, choosing an EP threshold is equivalent to finding a dataset- and aim-specific balance between sensitivity and precision of VC.393.7 Empirical determination of the EP thresholdInstead of using an arbitrary EP threshold, we reasoned that the EP threshold should be determined empirically, based on the distributions of EP values of HQ and low quality variants (LQ). In the absence of a published reference set of variants for the genotypes and genes used in this study, we generated an independent variant set for a subset of 78 genotypes using a Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing assay52 of 171 amplicons, of which 147 overlap with 28 out of the 503 candidate genes. Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing resulted in 126,000 reads per genotype on average (range 11,000–418,000), corresponding to an average RD of 619 reads per amplicon (range 24–20,000).Using the four VC pipelines integrated by the VMC resulted in a Hi-Plex variant set containing 813 SNPs and 184 indels, compared with 775 SNPs and 246 indels in the probe capture variant set that overlap with these amplicons. In total, 593 SNPs and 60 indels were commonly identified by the two independent sequencing-based genotyping methods. Together, these variants were defined as the HQ subset of variants. Conversely, SNPs and indels that were unique to either set (i.e. non-reproducible and more likely to be random artefacts), were defined as the LQ subset of variants per genotyping method.To further validate HQ variants, we compared genotype calls of two methods (probe capture vs Hi-Plex) at the individual genotype level. The mean genotype call consistency, calculated as percentage of identical genotype calls on the total of 593 HQ SNPs and 60 HQ indels, over all 78 genotypes was 97% (range 93–100%). This high level of genotype call consistency confirmed the HQ of commonly identified variants. Inconsistent genotype calls are most likely the result of failed probe capture, low RD, the complexity of the region potentially hampering read mapping, allele specific amplification bias in the amplicon sequencing data, or combinations thereof.Comparison of EP value distributions of HQ and LQ variant positions (Fig. 5) revealed that EP values of the Hi-Plex variant set were generally lower than those of the probe capture variant set, possibly because of higher RD and lower complexity of amplicon reads. Furthermore, EP values associated with HQ SNPs were higher than EP values of LQ SNPs for both Hi-Plex and probe capture SNP sets. Taken together, these data show that an EP threshold of 80% differentiates most HQ variants from LQ variants in the probe capture SNP set, whereas the EP threshold needs to be set at 70% to remove LQ variants from the Hi-Plex SNP set. This further indicates that different EP thresholds ought to be used depending on the genotyping method. In contrast to SNPs, there was no clear differentiation between EP values associated with HQ or LQ indels (Fig. 5). This shows that indel detection remains challenging because of mapping and/or realignment errors, and errors near repetitive regions,53 thus leading to an incomplete indel set and underestimation of frameshift variants. Distribution of EP values in HQ and LQ variant sets. For variants present in 78 genotypes and 147 amplicons, box plots show the distributions of EP values for commonly identified (HQ) and uniquely identified variants (LQ) in the probe capture and Hi-Plex variant sets.Distribution of EP values in HQ and LQ variant sets. For variants present in 78 genotypes and 147 amplicons, box plots show the distributions of EP values for commonly identified (HQ) and uniquely identified variants (LQ) in the probe capture and Hi-Plex variant sets.Using the empirically validated EP threshold of 80% for the probe capture variant set containing variants of 736 genotypes and 503 candidate genes resulted in 252,406 SNPs and 5,074 indels (Supplementary Data S3). The high genotype call consistency indicates that the VMC, at least for SNPs, was able to reliably integrate variant sets without losing genotype call quality. Moreover, using the VMC for precision-based filtering led to a higher genotype call rate compared with hard filtering of individual VC pipelines (Fig. 4c and d).3.8 Validation of the resulting variant set in an F1 progenyMendelian inheritance in a segregating F1 progeny derived from a bi-parental cross was used as an accuracy measurement for the precision-based filtered variant set: MIEs are most likely the result of erroneous genotype calls. The set of 736 individuals contained 2 parents and their respective F1 progeny of 29 individuals. The genotype calls of these individuals were used to calculate the number of MIEs. Out of the 257,480 variants, 10,669 contained a missing genotype call in either one or both parents (4%) and could not be tested. For the 246,881 remaining variants and 29 individuals, 89,789 MIEs were identified, of which 57,326 (63%) were due to a missing genotype call. The other 32,463 MIEs represent a genotype call error in only a fraction of all genotype calls among the 246,881 variants in this F1 progeny (<0.5%). Moreover, these MIEs corresponded to 9,440 variant positions (4%) of which most had a MIE in a single individual (Supplementary Fig. S3).3.9 Effects of sequence variation on gene functionWe investigated the consequences of sequence variants on predicted gene function, using the manually curated HQ gene models to annotate the variants with SnpEff.41 The complete annotation of functional effects for each of 252,406 SNPs and 5,074 indels is available as Supplementary Data S3. Out of the 257,480 variants, 65,225 resided in exon regions (25%) and 116,274 in intron regions (45%) corresponding to a density of 8.6 and 10.1 variants per 100 bp, respectively. Among the SNPs in coding regions, 38% were non-synonymous substitutions, which is consistent with previous observations in L. perenne transcriptomes.23–25A general overview of the abundance of high impact effects on gene function, listed per functional category or pathway is presented in Table 1. These include gain of stop codons, frame shifts and alterations in splice sites, as they are most likely to disrupt protein function, possibly leading to loss of function (LOF), and causing phenotypic variation. For instance, the variant set contained 256 stop gain variants, affecting 144 out of the 503 candidate genes. The position of each stop gain relative to the total CDS length could indicate the degree to which the protein is affected (Supplementary Fig. S4). Most of these stop gain variants occur at low allele frequency across the germplasm collection. Additionally, 72 candidate genes were affected by splice site variants: 40 variants affected donor splice sites and 47 variants affected acceptor splice sites. In line with the relatively low number of indels (5,074), only 20 frameshift variants were identified in 19 genes. In summary, naturally occurring LOF alleles could be readily identified in as much as one-third of the genes tested across various pathways that are important for plant growth and development.This variant catalogue can be exploited in a dual fashion: (1) to associate genomic variation with phenotypic variation using an association mapping approach, which we are currently performing for architectural traits and cell wall digestibility, or (2) to mine for rare defective alleles, i.e. variants that disrupt gene function or regulation, and to subsequently select carriers of these variants for detailed phenotypic analysis. For example, we observed naturally occurring alleles for the single copy genes GIGANTEA (LpGI-01) and ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABSCISIC ACID 1 (LpERA1-01), in which a premature stop codon truncates translation at 5% and 23% of the protein length, respectively. Crosses with the carriers of these putative null alleles could help to clarify the function of LpGI-01 in the regulation of flowering time, circadian clock, and/or hypocotyl elongation54 and LpERA1-01 in meristem organization and the ABA-mediated signal transduction pathway.55Sequence variants were determined in a germplasm collection representing commercial cultivars, breeding populations and wild accessions, so as to ensure the downstream application in current breeding programs. For instance, the 170 amplicons used to estimate the EP threshold, and to validate the genotype calls of the probe capture set, were designed to cover the genetic diversity in 28 genes putatively involved in flowering time and other phenotypic traits of interest to breeders. Design and validation of these amplicons is a clear illustration of the application of the variant set. Since a comprehensive set of SNPs and indels are now known for our breeding materials, detailed and customised design of PCR primers targeting specific SNPs in candidate genes spread across the genome, while avoiding polymorphisms in the flanking primer binding site, becomes feasible. Similar methods and criteria apply to the design of hybridization probes for high density SNP arrays. We are currently using Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing as a very cost- and time-efficient method to screen hundreds of variants simultaneously in a few thousand genotypes, a scale required to screen for putative associations with phenotypic traits in our current breeding populations.3.10 Reconstruction of divergent alleles enables better characterization of genetic variationThe prime goal of targeted resequencing is to de novo discover alleles that are divergent from the reference genome sequence. However, the capture efficiency of a divergent sequence is reduced with increasing sequence dissimilarity to the reference sequence for which the probes were designed. Additionally, reads may fail to map to highly divergent regions if the parameters for short read alignment are too stringent.18 To circumvent mapping short reads to a single reference sequence, on which classical VC pipelines rely, we devised a de novo assembly strategy to reconstruct full-length alleles. First, de novo assembly of the captured reads was performed per individual genotype to reconstruct alleles for each of the 503 candidate genes in parallel. Next, all de novo assembled contigs from all 736 genotypes were aligned to the reference genome to sort out and extract all corresponding allelic fragments per candidate gene. Per gene, all contigs were clustered using the OLC assembler CAP344 to collapse allelic redundancy and resolve fragmented gene sequences. This three-step approach results in a collection of alternative alleles assigned to each of the 503 candidate genes (on average 58 contigs per gene, range 4–203). The entire set of 29,320 CAP3 contigs is available as Supplementary Data S5. The value of this approach is that we can now characterize genetic variation in regions of high sequence diversity where traditional short read mapping-based VC pipelines fail.We demonstrate the value of this approach for LpSDUF247, but all analyses described below may be repeated for any of the other 502 candidate genes, using the sequence data supplied as Supplementary Data S5. LpSDUF247 is a highly polymorphic gene co-segregating with the S-locus that determines the grass self-incompatibility system.46 CAP3 clustered the allelic diversity present in the 736 genotypes into 34 separate contigs. Alignment of CAP3 contigs identified a central region of the protein with high sequence divergence, while this region is virtually free from SNPs in the VC dataset, showing the limitations of read mapping-based VC. Six contigs displayed high sequence similarity (98%) to the reference sequence or to other contigs and were removed. Within the remaining allelic contigs, a single exon encoded for the DUF247 protein. The translated proteins showed only 73–84% global sequence identity with each other (Fig. 6a). These data are consistent with the previously reported identification of at least five unique alleles of LpSDUF247 with 80–90% protein sequence identity.46 Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that de novo assembled contigs were indeed novel alleles of LpSDUF247 at the S-locus, and not of any of the 24 other DUF247 paralogs in the L. perenne genome (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). Sequence diversity and distribution of 28 newly identified alleles of LpSDUF247 across breeding populations and wild accessions. A similarity matrix (a) and phylogenetic tree (b) were built using the protein sequences of 28 alleles and reference sequence (R) of LpSDUF247, together with three additional DUF247 genes. Panel c gives an overview of the distribution of the LpSDUF247 alleles across the gene pool. The alleles present per genotype were identified by mapping the reads to a multi-allelic reference genome, and calculating the ratio of average RD per allele over the total number of reads mapping to LpSDUF247 alleles.Sequence diversity and distribution of 28 newly identified alleles of LpSDUF247 across breeding populations and wild accessions.

The alleles present per genotype were identified by mapping the reads to a multi-allelic reference genome, and calculating the ratio of average RD per allele over the total number of reads mapping to LpSDUF247 alleles.Next, we analysed the distribution of LpSDUF247 alleles across the L. perenne germplasm collection. The 28 novel alleles were added to the reference genome sequence, thus complementing the reference LpSDUF247 allele, and giving reads the opportunity for near-perfect mapping at their respective allele. Differential read mapping across the alleles in a multi-allelic context was then used to score which alleles are present in each genotype. Mapping reads in a multi-allelic context eliminates the need for VC, but only if alleles are sufficiently divergent so that differential RD can be used to identify which alleles are present per genotype. Near-perfect mapping of the raw reads onto the newly constructed LpSDUF247 alternative alleles confirmed their existence in the L. perenne germplasm collection, except for allele 31 which had no read support (Fig. 6c). This also shows that the capture efficiency of 120 bp probes was sufficient to detect alleles with as little as 80% sequence identity to the reference genome sequence.In the vast majority of genotypes (501 out of 736) the reads almost exclusively mapped onto a combination of two LpSDUF247 alleles, often at similar RD, and only a minor fraction (<5%) of reads mapped to additional alleles (Fig. 6c). There was no bias for combinations of alleles across wild accessions, breeding populations and cultivars, and clear segregation of alleles was observed in the F1 progeny (n = 29) of a bi-parental cross that was included in the set of 736 individuals (Supplementary Fig. S7). Furthermore, 57 genotypes displayed reads mapping only to a single allele, suggesting either homozygosity or the failure to capture and sequence yet undiscovered alternative alleles with even stronger sequence divergence to the reference genome sequence used to design the probes. Finally, 177 genotypes displayed RD spread over three or more alternative alleles. In 65 of them, the higher allele count could be explained by a consistent co-segregation of LpSDUF247-04 with LpSDUF247-28 suggesting a gene duplication, in combination with an additional, variable third allele. In the remaining 112 genotypes, the observation that reads map to more than two alleles in a multi-allelic reference genome, could indicate ambiguity of read mapping between closely related alleles, or the presence of additional alleles derived from cross-over events at the LpSDUF247 locus.Although LpSDUF247 was the most extreme case of sequence divergence in alternative alleles, Supplementary Figure S8 presents four other candidate genes with different levels of divergence, global or local. The alternative alleles of LpMAX3-01 and LpETR1-01 showed only local sequence divergence, at the introns and 5'UTR regions, respectively. The sequence variation of LpFT-04 was captured in only four contigs, explaining why the variant density across the gene region was low, especially when low frequent SNPs were filtered out. Taken together, the analysis of LpSDUF247 demonstrates the rich sequence diversity that can be mined for in this catalogue of genomic diversity across 503 candidate genes.We thank the breeders of ILVO, Barenbrug and Eurograss for providing plant material, András Gézsi for support and advice for running the VMC and Kurt Lamour (Floodlight Genomics) for his services provided for the Hi-Plex amplicon sequencing assay.

IntroductionHigh-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and associated bioinformatics are transforming the study of evolutionary and comparative genetics, offering an unprecedented opportunity to characterize and understand diversity and function in both model and non-model organisms.1–3 In this context, one recent revolution is the use of HTS technologies to analyse sets of RNA molecules, transcriptomes, on a massively parallel scale.4,5 The transcriptome is a snapshot in time of genes transcribed in the tissue or cells sampled. Investigation of transcriptomes can allow the identification of functional elements of genomes, reveal molecular constituents of cells and tissues, help understand organismal development and disease,6 and has the potential to uncover the role of tissue-specific evolution in biological diversity.7 Having entered the phylogenomics era, RNA-seq has also become a powerful complement of de novo genome sequencing, particularly helping with functional annotation8 and gene expression assessment, and is sometimes the only practical approach to scan and survey gene diversity in organisms with large genomes that still lack reference genomic data.9 A general strategy for this approach is to pool the mRNA data from a wide range of tissues (from different individuals and/or stages of development) to assemble a reference dataset of the genes of the species (i.e. a proxy of the reference genome of the species).We have applied the pooling of tissue-specific reads from RNA-seq to the study of tissue-specific transcriptomic landscapes of five species of caecilian amphibians (order Gymnophiona) representing four of the ten currently recognized families (Caeciliidae, Rhinatrematidae, Siphonopidae and Typhlonectidae) and a range of ecologies and degrees of evolutionary divergence (including coverage of both branches of the basal evolutionary divergence within the order).10 Caecilians are, along with frogs and salamanders, one of the three orders of extant amphibians. They are a highly specialized group with elongate, annulated, limbless bodies, reduced visual systems and with paired bilateral sensory tentacles on the snout.11 There are 207 currently recognized extant species classified in 32 genera, with mainly tropical distributions and mainly burrowing habits.12–14 Most are terrestrial as adults, living in soil, but several species of the Typhlonectidae (including the one sampled here) are fully aquatic. Caecilians are an old group, with at least 250 million years (myr) of separate evolution from their sister-group, the frogs and salamanders.15–19 Due to their specialized body form, ecological distinctiveness and phylogenetic position in the vertebrate tree of life, caecilians are interesting for macro-evolutionary, life history and evolutionary developmental biology research.11We provide a first large-scale characterization of caecilian genomes using multi-tissue transcriptomic landscapes generated with RNA-seq. We use two complementary approaches to investigate features of caecilian protein-coding sequences in a vertebrate comparative framework. First, we assess the degree to which homologous elements of caecilian functional genes of varying tissue specificity can be identified across 51 other vertebrates. This reveals a high number of unclassified candidate gene families that are transcribed differentially across tissue types in caecilians. Comparisons between the already known vertebrate gene families and the potentially novel gene families found in caecilians highlight the relevance of skin-specific genes and the poor characterization of the molecular elements of caecilian skin. Here, we start addressing this knowledge gap by identifying protein domains for the caecilian skin-specific genes. Second, we infer the phylogenetic relationships of the five sampled caecilian species and the same set of 51 vertebrates based on candidate orthologous genes. This study provides new information about the functional elements of the genome and phylogenomics of caecilians and highlights distinctive and singular genes for the most neglected amphibian order.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample preparation and high-throughput sequencingThis study includes novel data from five caecilian species: Rhinatrema bivittatum (Guérrin-Méneville, 1838), Caecilia tentaculata Linnaeus, 1758, Typhlonectes compressicauda (Duméril & Bibron, 1841), Microcaecilia unicolor (Duméril, 1861) and Microcaecilia dermatophaga Wilkinson, Sherratt, Starace & Gower, 2013. Different tissues (skin, posterior skin [from the posterior end of the body], foregut, muscle, liver, kidney, lung, heart, spleen and testis) were collected from freshly sacrificed, captive (but wild caught, in French Guiana) maintained specimens anesthetized with tricaine methanesulphonate (MS222). Biopsy samples were cut into pieces thinner than 0.25 cm in any single dimension, immediately soaked in RNAlater stabilization solution (Qiagen), incubated at 4°C overnight (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue) and stored at -20°C. Numbers of specimens and of tissues sampled per species, voucher and sampling information are given in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1. Information on the species-specific caecilian transcriptome assemblies and their annotationN: number of specimens; T: number of tissues; % CEGs: percentage completeness core eukaryotic genes; veNOG annotation: number of genes with similarity match in veNOG database; KVGF annotation: number of known vertebrate gene families with caecilian genes.Information on the species-specific caecilian transcriptome assemblies and their annotationN: number of specimens; T: number of tissues; % CEGs: percentage completeness core eukaryotic genes; veNOG annotation: number of genes with similarity match in veNOG database; KVGF annotation: number of known vertebrate gene families with caecilian genes.RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer’s instructions, following tissue disruption and homogenization with TissueRuptor (Qiagen). RNA quantity and quality was assessed with Qubit 2.0 fluorometer, NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (RNA Nano Chip). Forty RNA extractions with RNA integrity number, RIN,20 values ranging from 7.8 to 10 were selected for RNA-seq. These 40 selected samples included RNA extractions of skin, liver and kidney for all five caecilian species, as well as a selection of other tissues (foregut, muscle, lung, heart, spleen, testis) each available for only a subset of the species (see Supplementary Table S1). Unstranded paired-end sequencing after poly-A enrichment and TruSeq library preparation was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform at Macrogen (16 RNA extraction samples) and BGI Tech Solutions (24 RNA extraction samples) using ten dual flow cells, two lanes per sample. All RNA extractions from the same tissue were sequenced by the same company.2.2. Raw data processing and de novo assemblyPaired-end RNA-seq raw reads (100 nucleotides long) of each of the 40 tissue samples were trimmed individually and filtered by PRINSEQ 0.20.321 after inspection of the FastQC 0.11.222 quality control report. In all cases, the first 15 bases from the 5' end of the reads, optical duplicates and reads with an average Phred quality score23 below 25 were removed. Separate de novo assemblies were performed for each of the five caecilian species employed in the study (species-specific transcriptome assemblies). These were carried out by pooling together all reads (filtered and trimmed) for tissue samples belonging to the same species (Supplementary Table S1). Reads were also pooled for all (both) specimens for each of the two species for which multiple specimens were sampled. A few preliminary de novo assembly runs of separate tissue samples (single-tissue transcriptome assemblies) were conducted on the TRUFA platform24 to explore parameter settings and run times.De novo species-specific assemblies were performed with Trinity r2014071725 using 60 Gb of RAM (–max_memory 60G) and prior in silico normalization (with otherwise default settings26). TransDecoder 2.026 was used with default settings to identify candidate protein-coding genes from the subsets of contigs with open reading frame (ORFs) in the five caecilian species-specific transcriptomes. Reads were mapped back to each assembly with Bowtie 2.0.2,27 post-processed with SAMtools28 and gene expression was estimated using the counts of reads mapping to each assembly with HTSeq 0.6.1.29 Multiple measures (N50, median contig length, average contig length, alignment percentage) were used for assessing the accuracy of each of the five caecilian species-specific assemblies.30,31 Likewise, we used a computational method, CEGMA 2.4,32 to estimate the percentage completeness of each caecilian transcriptome, and compared these with the completeness percentages of the genome assemblies of the frog Xenopus tropicalis Gray, 1864 v9.0 and v4.1.33 Finally, we compared our species-specific transcriptomes to other transcriptomes recently generated for four species of caecilians, including for two of our sampled species (R. bivittatum, T. compressicauda, T. natans [Fischer, 1880] and Geotrypetes seraphini [Duméril, 1859]).34 These previously published caecilian transcriptomes are not associated with tissue-expression information and they contain fewer ORFs than do our transcriptomes for the same species. Using similarity searches, we determined that the vast majority (89.83%) of the protein-coding genes from the previous transcriptomes occur also in our transcriptomes (using BLAST, blastp version 2.2.2835 with e-value threshold of 1e-20: data not shown). Thus, the previously published caecilian genomic data were not used in our subsequent analyses.2.3. Multigene family analysisContigs of the five new species-specific caecilian transcriptomes containing ORFs were aligned against predefined vertebrate-specific gene families (veNOGs) from the EggNOG 4.1 database36 using blastp, applying a conservative e-value threshold of 1e-20 (applying less conservative 1e-10 or 1e-5 cutoffs does not result in substantially greater annotation percentages: data not shown). Contigs with expression levels below 100 total read counts were discarded and not used in subsequent analyses. We classified all caecilian annotations (from the pooled contigs of the five species) according to the gene-expression presence across the tissues sampled. For tissue expression analysis, contigs were postulated as being expressed in a particular tissue of a particular transcriptome if they had a minimum of 10 reads aligning to them. This allowed a scale of ‘tissue presence’ to be generated, ranging from those genes found expressed in every tissue type to those found expressed in only one tissue type. The distribution of all homologues of the caecilian protein-coding genes on the vertebrate taxonomy tree from the NCBI taxonomy database was generated and visualized using phyloT and ITOL,37 respectively. Vertebrate taxonomy tree was built using the unique identifier, taxids, of the species that are included in the EggNOG database.Where possible, caecilian gene families were annotated with the same function as those vertebrate gene families with the best BLAST match (smallest e-value and highest BIT score) in EggNOG identified above. Transcripts with no hits to the known vertebrate gene families in EggNOG were clustered using CD-HIT 4.6.438 with a threshold of 90% amino acid sequence identity to ensure same function of the sequences clustered. These clusters were compared against protein-coding genes from currently available amphibian genomes (Ambystoma mexicanum [Shaw & Nodder, 1798], Nanorana parkeri [Stejneger, 1927], Rana catesbeiana Shaw 1802 and Xenopus laevis [Daudin, 1802])33,39–41 that are not included in the EggNOG database, using blastp, with an e-value threshold of 1e-20. Clusters that remained without similarity hits after the searches against the amphibian genomes were classified as potentially (candidate) novel caecilian gene families. Of these, we calculated the number of tissues in which any gene family was expressed (as described earlier). In addition, to characterize the different tissues with a more restrictive approach than the previously used tissue presence classification, tissue specificity was postulated when 95% of total read counts in each caecilian contig belonged to a single tissue for both unclassified and known vertebrate gene families. To test if there was a greater number of candidate novel genes specific to a particular tissue type than expected by chance, the relative abundance of known vertebrate gene families versus those of candidate novel caecilian gene families were compared using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test conducted with R 3.3.0,42 with the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the numbers of tissue-specific candidate novel genes. Finally, our characterization of tissue specificity expression was completed with the inference of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and functional enrichment pathways using STRING43 with the option of auto-detect organism for the known vertebrate gene families; and the Pfam44 annotation of the uncharacterized, candidate novel caecilian gene families using HMMER 3.045 with default parameters to identify protein domains.2.4. Orthology prediction and phylogenomic analysisTo carry out a phylogenomic analysis we identified candidate orthologous genes from across vertebrates, including our caecilian samples. To do this we used OrthoFinder 0.2.846 and used as input all predicted protein-coding genes from the caecilian transcriptomes and all protein-coding sequences for the 51 vertebrates represented in the EggNOG database. From the results of OrthoFinder analysis we filtered out any groups (orthogroups) that had more than one gene copy in one species (co-orthologues for different species and paralogues for the same species). Multiple-sequence alignments were performed individually for each of the resulting filtered orthogroups using MAFFT 7.24547 with default settings, and individual gene trees were inferred using approximately maximum-likelihood with FastTree 2.1.848 and the JTT+CAT model of amino acid substitutions.49 We reconstructed a supertree using ASTRAL 4.10.11, which provides statistically consistent species tree inference from gene trees subject to incomplete lineage sorting,50,51 and computed posterior probabilities and quartet support for the internal branches of the main recovered topology.3. Results and discussion3.1. De novo transcriptome assembliesIn total, RNA sequencing yielded nearly two billion reads (1,963,110,986), averaging 49 million reads per library. The five species-specific assemblies from pooled reads of all tissues of each species resulted in transcriptomes of a mean of 146,227 contigs with N50 values of 1,263–1,884 (Supplementary Table S2). Tissue-specific RNA-seq reads and species-specific de novo transcriptome assemblies are available from NCBI through BioProject ID number PRJNA387587. The maximum and minimum contig lengths were 27,126 and 201 (default minimum size parameter used in the assembly program) bases, respectively. The longest contig was reconstructed from the R. bivittatum transcriptome and only a few very long (see Supplementary Fig. S1) contigs were present in any of the species-specific caecilian transcriptomes. In addition to transcriptome metrics, we assessed the quality of the de novo assemblies by the extent to which each pair of raw reads (more than 95%) could be mapped to the same contig (Supplementary Table S2). On average, 27,600 protein-coding genes were identified from the contigs with ORFs, (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Our caecilian transcriptome reconstructions were supported also by the annotation. At least 241 of 248 ultra-conserved core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) occur in all five species-specific transcriptomes (Table 1). For the sake of comparison, we checked also the presence of CEGs in two different genome assemblies of X. tropicalis and found 225 CEGs in the most recent (v9.0) and 219 in an earlier version (v4.1).On the basis of the quality of our transcriptome assembly reconstructions, we obtained useful reference genomic records for caecilian amphibians, the first to our knowledge that are broad and diverse in terms of species and tissues sampled. Although the metrics used to assess the quality of assemblies of transcriptomic data are controversial30 our caecilian transcriptome sequences contain more CEGs than the two genome assemblies of X. tropicalis used for comparison, suggesting that our reference species-specific transcriptomes are fairly complete (Table 1). Even so, the generated reference transcriptomes are not fully complete, missing specific genes related to developmental stages and to tissues not sampled in our study. As with estimates for other vertebrates, the number of protein-coding genes identified in the species-specific caecilian transcriptomes is approximately 25,000 (Table 1), and a relatively high percentage of such proteins were annotated, which is also indicative of accurate transcriptome reconstruction. Gene identification is one of the major challenges of de novo transcriptome assembly, even for Trinity assembly of paired-end sequence data that enables potentially confounding sources of variation such as alternative splicing and paralogous genes to be overcome.25 Thus, the numbers of protein-coding genes could be overestimated. An additional problem is that the transcriptomes are not composed solely of transcripts from protein-coding genes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that almost the entire genome is transcribed.52 Accordingly, caecilian contigs that are not protein-coding genes or degradation products of the same, nor possible chimeras, are postulated to be long non-coding RNAs and potentially important regulatory elements.3.2. Vertebrate gene families and unclassified gene familiesThe vast majority of the annotated caecilian genes that are homologous with those vertebrate genes in the EggNOG database, are expressed in most of the (up to nine) sampled caecilian tissue types. This could be interpreted as indicative of constitutive expression and many might be housekeeping genes. Only a small proportion (see Fig. 1, one tissue fraction) of the caecilian genes with matches to EggNOG (and thus annotated) are tissue specific. This same pattern was found when comparing the pooled caecilian sample (all five species) with each of the 51 EggNOG database vertebrates, with no obvious phylogenetic pattern (Fig. 1). The number of caecilian contigs with matches to known vertebrate genes ranged from 17,099 to 19,863 per caecilian species (Table 1), representing 57.32–77.52% (mean 67.70%) of all caecilian protein-coding genes. We found that 38.75–52.91% (mean 46.36%) of the annotated caecilian genes were classified into vertebrate gene families from EggNOG. Numbers and tissue presence of the annotated genes found in caecilian transcriptomes. Genes were pooled for the five sampled species-specific transcriptomes and annotated in the 51 vertebrate species available on the EggNOG database, and mapped onto a vertebrate phylogeny inferred from the NCBI’s taxids (using phyloT and ITOL). For each vertebrate taxon, the number of caecilian annotated genes is subdivided to show the number of caecilian tissue types in which those genes are expressed.Numbers and tissue presence of the annotated genes found in caecilian transcriptomes.

For each vertebrate taxon, the number of caecilian annotated genes is subdivided to show the number of caecilian tissue types in which those genes are expressed.To investigate and quantify the importance of the uncharacterized genes in caecilians, we grouped these protein-coding sequences into multigene families and filtered them by excluding clusters with close similarity to genes from the available amphibian genomes. If caecilian genomes did not contain genes novel for vertebrates, it would be expected that the vast majority of their genes would belong to some already described, known vertebrate gene family or have homologous sequences in the reported amphibian genomes. However, our results indicate that less than half of the caecilian gene families belong to known vertebrate gene families. Given the sparse taxon sampling and the currently poor genomic reference record for amphibians, at least some of the unclassified gene families in caecilians could contain genes from other vertebrate taxa or be amphibian rather than caecilian specific. The absence of homologues of these caecilian gene families in other vertebrate species might reflect gene loss events53,54 or, alternatively, faster sequence evolution in some caecilian genes. Either way, caecilians likely have many functional elements that are novel for vertebrates.A total of 177 known vertebrate and 422 novel caecilian gene families exhibit tissue-specific expression (Table 2). A significantly greater number of novel caecilian genes were expressed only in skin (P-value = 4.5e-05, Fisher’s exact test). In contrast, caecilian spleen transcripts had significantly lower than expected tissue-specific novel gene families (P-value = 0.01935, Fisher’s exact test). Among the tissue-specific known vertebrate gene families, we found significantly more predicted protein–protein interactions (PPIs) than expected by chance and functional enrichment of metabolic pathways in five caecilian tissues (foregut, kidney, liver, spleen and testis, see Supplementary Table S3). The functional enrichments observed tend to relate to well-characterized processes in these tissues such as nutrient absorption in the foregut samples (GO: 0007586), organic acid, anion and amino acid transmembrane transport in the kidney samples (GO:1903825, GO:0098656, GO:0003333), and regulation of fibrinolysis in the liver (GO:0051918), (see Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, in skin samples we did not observe significantly more PPIs than expected by chance, or functional enrichment of pathways in the genes with known annotations. This may be because the vast majority (87%) of genes with tissue-specific gene expression in skin did not match any known vertebrate gene families, the highest of any of the tissues examined (Table 2). This analysis suggests that skin-specific vertebrate gene families remain poorly characterized in general and likely have unknown, innovative functions and interactions. Novel tissue-specific genes in caeciliansThe number of transcriptomes determined for each tissue, and the tissue-specific gene families (caecilian gene families that are already known vertebrate gene families, caecilian gene families shared with the other four sampled non-caecilian amphibians, and candidate caecilian-specific gene families) are shown. The last row shows the P-value (significant values in bold font) for Fisher’s exact test of the difference between the abundance of known vertebrate gene families and those of uncharacterized candidate novel caecilian gene families. Skin tissue includes skin samples from different parts of the body: skin and posterior skin samples, see Supplementary Table S1.Novel tissue-specific genes in caeciliansThe number of transcriptomes determined for each tissue, and the tissue-specific gene families (caecilian gene families that are already known vertebrate gene families, caecilian gene families shared with the other four sampled non-caecilian amphibians, and candidate caecilian-specific gene families) are shown.

Skin tissue includes skin samples from different parts of the body: skin and posterior skin samples, see Supplementary Table S1.3.3. Skin-specific genes of caeciliansPotentially novel caecilian gene families (those without hits to known genes) expressed in skin were annotated with protein domains that might be associated causally with specializations of caecilian skin.55,56 From the uncharacterized tissue-specific clusters (108 in the skin), a total of 91 different protein domains were identified (Supplementary Table S4), including 16 domains occurring exclusively in the skin in our analysis, such as diverse proteases, amino acid storage receptors and toxin-like domains. Skin forms the barrier between the organism and the environment both physically and biochemically. It is genetically and physiologically very active throughout an animal’s life. Amphibian skin is multifunctional with additional roles in respiration, water regulation, and in defence against predators and pathogens.57,58 The defensive properties of amphibian skin rely mainly on biochemical substances secreted from specialized skin granular glands.59 These secretions can contain numerous bioactive components, including alkaloids, biogenic amines, peptides and proteins,60 some of which have been isolated and studied, particularly in frogs and salamanders.61–63 The diversity of functions and biochemical activities of amphibian skin makes it unsurprising that caecilians present specific expression patterns of novel genes, particularly considering their 250+ myr of separate evolutionary history from the other major amphibian lineages15–19 and the sustained contact between the skin and soil for most caecilian species. Indeed, some of the protein domains found exclusively in caecilian skin-specific novel gene families, such as proteases and toxin-like domains (Asp_protease_2, gag-asp_proteas, Toxin_TOLIP, UPAR_LY6, see Supplementary Table S4) point to novel skin defensive mechanisms.The maternal skin of some caecilian species plays another unique role: in provision of nutrition to newborns (maternal dermatophagy).64,65 This behaviour occurs in several of the species sampled in this study (observed in M. dermatophaga, likely also present in M. unicolor and C. tentaculata).10 This phenomenon is especially interesting for understanding the evolution of viviparity because it is possibly a precursor of the oviduct feeding by fetuses that occurs in viviparous caecilians.62 Maternal dermatophagy involves structural and histochemical changes in the mothers’ epidermis, it becomes hypertrophied and heavily invested with energy reserves,64 and hence expanded gene machinery is likely needed. Amino acid storage receptor (PhaP_Bmeg, see Supplementary Table S4) is another protein domain found in skin-specific novel gene families that might be related to the unique parental care of caecilian amphibians. A final feature of caecilian skin that makes it so distinctive is the presence of scales.66 Scales are absent in other extant amphibians but are present, concealed in dermal pockets, in many caecilians (all except T. compressicauda of those sampled in our study). Some of the skin-specific gene families with domains of unknown function (DUF, see Supplementary Table S4) might be involved in the production and maintenance of scales.Further data and analyses are required to identify the taxonomic distribution, diversity and function of these candidate skin-specific gene families. Greater tissue sampling in the future may reveal similar patterns in other tissues, such as testis or gut, that present particularities in caecilians with respect to other amphibians that may be reflected in their genomes. For example, caecilians differ from other amphibians in that males have a copulatory organ formed from the eversible final part of the gut,67 as well as other autapomorphies of the sperm and internal fertilization specializations such as the Müllerian gland and the ejaculate.683.4. Phylogenomic datasetWe obtained a total of 23,761 groups or orthogroups, of which 1,955 were groups comprising genes with only one copy in at least four vertebrate taxa. The filtered orthogroups seemingly contain no paralogous genes, at least from the same species, and are straightforward for use in phylogenomics and the study of evolutionary processes that depend upon inferred phylogenetic relationships.69 The number of analysed genes found in each species is detailed in Supplementary Table S5. For each of the 1,955 orthogroups phylogenetic gene trees were inferred. A supertree was retrieved from the gene trees under a multi-species coalescent model, maximizing the number of induced quartet trees (the supertree is presented in Supplementary Fig. S2). The normalized quartet score of the main topology was 0.798 (i.e. 79.8% of the quartet trees displayed by our gene trees are displayed by the supertree). The supertree constructed from the gene trees of the candidate orthologous groups recovered the main known topology of this subset of the Tree of Life (Supplementary Fig. S2). Branches within the caecilian part of the supertree are well supported as judged by both posterior probabilities and quartet support values. Among the sampled vertebrates, Lissamphibia and Gymnophiona are recovered as monophyletic, and the inferred relationships among the five caecilian species are fully congruent with those inferred in other (non-phylogenomic and phylogenomic) molecular analyses.10,34 Our results indicate that combining the information from putative orthologous genes using supertree approach is adequate to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the sampled caecilians, and vertebrates in general.4. Concluding remarksAs with other studies that have characterized transcriptomes,9 this study has a strong descriptive component, but it has yielded novel discoveries and represents an important turning point for genomic studies in caecilians (and vertebrates), improving prospects for future research. The species-specific de novo transcriptomes of caecilian amphibians presented here could be improved by additional sequencing of different tissues, individuals and developmental stages (e.g. the transcriptome of M. dermatophaga was built from only four tissue-type samples). In terms of sampling and biological replicates, only the species-specific transcriptomes of R. bivittatum and M. unicolor were reconstructed using more than one (two) specimen each. Obtaining fresh biological samples has been a limiting step for research on many caecilian species,70 and dedicated fieldwork will likely be required to investigate broadly the genomic potential of this neglected, but important group of vertebrates.Genome science has irreversibly changed the landscape of biological research. Understanding life processes and their evolutionary changes by reading the complete set of encoded instructions that each species holds is increasingly becoming a reality. Nonetheless, achieving this goal thoroughly still remains a challenge for most groups of organisms. Of the almost 6,600 eukaryotic genomes available on the NCBI database, only six records are of amphibian species: A. mexicanum, N. parkeri, R. catesbeiana, Rhinella marina Linnaeus, 1758, X. laevis and X. tropicalis (21 September 2018, date last accessed). Despite the great effort made by initiatives such as the Genome 10 K Project71,72 and other genome-scale studies (e.g. Xenbase,33 Salamander Genome project73), amphibians are the major group of vertebrates with fewest genomic resources available, and, importantly, there are none for the order Gymnophiona.74 The lack of at least one representative organism of each of the three extant amphibian orders has compromised the diversity of comparable genomic resources for vertebrates, as well as the opportunities for evolutionary and phylogenomic research. To start filling this gap, here we have reported transcriptomic data for five caecilian amphibian species, including first genomic records for three species (C. tentaculata, M. unicolor and M. dermatophaga), and characterized several unclassified candidate gene families with tissue-specific expression, especially in the skin. This provides insights into the evolution of vertebrate protein-coding genes, and further establishes the basis for gene-discovery work as well as investigation of the molecular elements underlying the singular biology of caecilian amphibians.We thank Ainhoa Agorreta, Cristina Frías-López, Julio Rozas, Rafael Zardoya, Kim Roelants, Karen Siu-Ting, Jeff Streicher and Iván de la Hera for insightful comments, help, and advice on this project.

IntroductionCo-linearity among closely related genomes erodes over time due to the accumulation of mutations including gene duplication, deletion, and transposition.1 Gene duplication affects gene dosage, which may lead to divergence of expression and functions among duplicates.2,3 Gene transposition events modify expression strength and tissue-specificity through changes in regulatory sequences,4,5 local epigenetic environment,6 and proximity to enhancers and chromatin structural contexts.7–9 Such events have been associated with variation in copy numbers of genes and transcripts,5,10 as well as localization11 and functions12–14 of encoded proteins among orthologous genes. A large number of studies have reported examples of gene level duplications and transpositions as key underlying sources for adaptations to specific environments or speciation.15–21Comparative analysis of co-linearity and its erosion identifies modes of gene duplications22,23 and traces the origin of genes or gene families and their evolutionary history.24–26 Such comparative analyses are facilitated by de novo assembled genomes released at unprecedented rates today,27–30 enabling detection of gene gain and loss as well as duplication and transposition among closely related taxa. These resources also call for novel methods and tools for systematic comparative analysis of genomes.A number of tools are available for identification of gene blocks or large genomic regions co-linear among multiple genomes.31–33 Another set of tools can identify orthologues in related genomes for a gene of interest and visualize synteny and evolutionary events, such as gene duplication and transposition, associated with them.34–38 However, currently we do not have a method that can retrieve all orthologue loci within multiple genomes that have likely undergone the same set of evolutionary events without a prior assignment of a gene of interest.To address this, we introduce the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline, which identifies co-linearity (CL) in the gene order among multiple genomes, identify ‘orthologue groups’ based on co-linearity, and encodes genes in each orthologue group as a network of orthologues (OrthNet). Each orthologue group includes orthologues and paralogues likely derived from a single ancestral locus in multiple target genomes. All evolutionary events in each orthologue group, such as gene duplication, deletion, transposition, and any combination of them, in addition to gene synteny conservation, are captured as the topology of an OrthNet. Our pipeline enables detection of all orthologue groups from multiple genome that seemingly underwent the same evolutionary events, by searching OrthNets essentially based on their topologies.As a proof-of-concept, we applied the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline to six Brassicaceae (crucifer) genomes that share the same whole genome duplication history.39 The six Brassicaceae genomes included the model species Arabidopsis thaliana40 and extremophytes Schrenkiella parvula41 and Eutrema salsugineum,42,43 the two most salt-tolerant Brassicaceae species so far tested.44,S. parvula and E. salsugineum are biogeographicaly seperated and represent taxa adapted to multi-ion salt strsses in soils near a hypersaline lake in central Anatolia5 and combined salt and freezing stresses in salt pans of high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere,45,46 respectively. These two extremophytes provide optimal models for comparative analyses to study plant adaptations to environmental challenges.47,48The CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline detects any combination of gene synteny conservation, duplications, deletions, and transpositions. For this study, we focused on the relatively under-studied transposition–duplication (tr–d) events within the six Brassicaceae genomes. A tr–d is an event where a single non-transposon gene is duplicated and relocated to a position where all evidence of common ancestry (i.e. synteny) is lost, i.e. ‘Duplication mode IV’ as defined by Freeling.22 A tr–d event results in variations in both copy numbers and co-linearity and, unlike other types of gene duplications, requires a systematic comparison of multiple genomes for detection.22,49 Our pipeline identified tr–d events unique to a genome or shared by any subset of the six Brassicaceae genomes, as well as the original donor and duplicate loci in each tr–d event including loci with truncated coding regions. Using this pipeline, we aim to identify the landscape of lineage-specific and shared tr–d events among the target genomes; test whether there is a signature of selective retention among lineage-specific tr–d events; and characterize tr–d events unique to the extremophyte genomes, which may have contributed to their adaptive evolution.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome and gene modelsWe obtained genome annotations of Arabidopsis lyrata (Aly, version 1.0), A. thaliana (Ath, v. ‘TAIR10’), Capsella rubella (Cru, v. 1.0), and E. salsugineum (Esa, v. 1.0) from Phytozome v. 11 (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), while genomes of Sisymbrium irio (Sir, v. 0.2; CoGE genome id 19579) and S. parvula (v. 2.0) were downloaded from CoGE (https://genomevolution.org/coge/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)) and thellungiella.org (http://thellungiella.org/data/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), respectively. For S. irio annotation, we used a combination of RepeatMasker, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Nucleotides (BLASTN)50 search vs Repbase v. 20170127 (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), and OrthoMCL51 to further filter out gene models most likely unannotated transposable elements (TEs). This step was added to remove the large number of repetitive lineage-specific genes (34.9% of 49,956 gene models), many of them showing sequence similarities with known TEs, in the S. irio genome annotation. To generate a species tree of Brassicaceae genomes including the six target species (Fig. 1), we used Agalma52 which built a maximum likelihood tree based on 14,614 alignments of homologous protein-coding gene clusters. Each cluster contained sequences from more than four crucifer genomes. We listed in Supplementary Table S1 additional genome resources used for the Brassicaceae species tree.

Boxes and stars indicate the six Brassicaceae species selected for this work and halophytes, respectively. The tree was based on an alignment of 14,614 homologous gene clusters, as described in Materials and Methods.For the analysis of co-linearity erosion (Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1), we compared all protein-coding gene loci in five crucifer genomes to those in A. thaliana using BLASTN. Four degenerate site (4d) substitution rate distributions were analysed for all reciprocal BLASTN pairs of protein-coding genes between the five crucifer genomes and A. thaliana, using codeml53 and custom scripts. TE contents were determined using RepeatMasker v. 4.0.7 and RepeatModeler v. 1.0.8 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)), for all six target species.2.2. Detecting co-linearity in gene orders among Brassicaceae genomesWe developed the CLfinder process to scan the order of homologous gene loci between a pair of genomes and detect co-linearity among them. The CLfinder module performs this process automatically for all pairs among multiple closely related genomes. The CLfinder uses three inputs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2), for which we used only primary transcript models for protein-coding gene loci. Input 1: A custom script (‘parse_gtf.py’) parsed genome annotation in Genomic Transfer Format (GTF). Input 2: Intra-species paralogous loci detected by clustering primary protein-coding gene model sequences within each species using OrthoMCL,51 as previously described in ref. 5. Input 3: Results of pairwise reciprocal BLASTN (e < 10-5) between all primary protein-coding gene model ORFs to obtain the ten most similar BLASTN hits (‘best-hits’) in the target species, for each gene model in the query species. The CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline consists of two modules, CLfinder (Co-Linearity finder) and ONfinder (OrthNet finder). In the cartoon next to the box for the CLfinder module, blue squares indicate gene loci with disrupted co-linearity due to mutations and indels in neighbouring loci, while orange squares are those transposed and lost the synteny. See Supplementary Fig. S1 for details. Next to the box for the ONfinder module is an exemplary OrthNet. (A) For the detailed method to determine co-linearity (CL) relationship between the query loci and their most homologous counterpart (‘best-hits’) in the target genome, see Materials and Methods (2.2) and Figs S2 and S3.

(B) See Figures 3–6, for examples of OrthNets with different evolutionary histories represented as different network topologies, e.g. transposition (tr) and transposition–duplication (tr–d) unique to each species or a group of species.The sensitivity and stringency of the CLfinder process are adjustable based on three user-defined parameters, the window size (W), the number of co-linear loci-in-chain threshold (N), and the maximum gap allowed between co-linear loci-in chain (G) (Supplementary Fig. S2). For each query locus (from Input 1), CLfinder scans and counts the number of ‘loci-in-chain’, whose best-hits (from Input 3) are separated by the same or less than G from the best-hit of their immediate neighbours. The scan starts from the query locus and moves towards both up- and downstream of the query genome. If more than N loci-in-chain, including the query locus, are found within a window size of 2 × W (i.e. W to the up- and downstream), the query locus is declared co-linear (cl) with its best-hit locus in the target species. When loci-in-chain were found only towards one direction, the query-target best-hit pair is considered to represent an end of a co-linear genome segment derived from inversions, indels, and segmental duplications involving multiple gene loci, and designated as ‘cl_end’. We excluded lineage-specific (ls) loci that did not have a best-hit in the target species from the search for co-linear loci-in-chain. Tandem duplicated (td) loci, defined as adjacent loci separated by the same or less than T loci (Supplementary Fig. S2) and in the same paralogue cluster defined in Input 2, were counted as a single locus during the co-linearity search step. A query locus neither co-linear (cl) nor lineage-specific (ls) was considered to be transposed (tr). If the query locus is in a genome assembly scaffold that contains less than W loci, the pipeline will mark the query locus as not-determined (nd) instead of transposed (tr). Segmental rearrangements such as local inversion are identified based on loci-in-chain detected exclusively in either up- or down-stream. In such cases, CLfinder declares the query and its best-hit as cl_end.For the analysis of six crucifer genomes, CLfinder parameters (W = 20, N = 3, G = 20, and T = 4) were decided based on the distribution of protein-coding gene locus content in the scaffolds of the most fragmented genome and the results from the analysis of co-linearity erosion. The window size (W) was chosen based on the most fragmented S. irio genome, where >63% of total genes were in scaffolds that contained at least 20 gene loci. Maximum gap between co-linear loci-in-chain (G = 20) was decided to distinguish gene order displacements likely caused by local indels from those by transpositions, based on the result of co-linearity erosion analysis (Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1). With W and N parameters set, we tested multiple number of co-linear loci-in-chain threshold (N) parameters to detect co-linear genes between simulated genomes of 27,000 gene loci, assuming a complete random shuffling and lack of a common ancestor between genomes. With N = 3, after 10,000 simulations comparing randomly shuffled simulated genomes, CLfinder found on average only 39.43 ± 9.85 genes (0.15 ± 0.04% of the simulated genome) as false-positive co-linear genes, indicating that the selected parameters can effectively rule out co-linearity by chance and without a common ancestry (Supplementary Table S2). We determined the maximum tandem duplication distance (T = 4) to enable detection of nested tandem duplication events while filtering out tandem duplications with too many unrelated genes inserted in between. The CLfinder process (Supplementary Fig. S3) was performed for all possible query-target pairs for the six crucifer species using a wrapper script in the CLfinder module (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘CLfinder_multi.py’). The results are combined into a single table and given as Supplementary Dataset S1.2.3. Construction of OrthNets for Brassicaceae genomesThe second module of the pipeline, ONfinder (OrthNet finder), combines the output of the CLfinder module and produces networks of orthologous loci (OrthNet). OrthNets represent primary protein-coding gene loci from all species (nodes) connected with their best-hits with directional edges, and the co-linearity relationship (i.e. either cl, tr, or nd) between them as the edge property. In addition, OrthNets include tandem duplicated paralogues connected with undirected edges (td) among themselves. The ONfinder module also compares the ORF size of a node to the median ORF size of all neighbouring nodes to detect truncated ORFs (i.e. of sizes less than 40 and 80% of the median ORF size) in each OrthNet.ONfinder first clusters all nodes from all species connected with an edge (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘create_OrthNet.py’). This process often results in an aggregation of multiple loci connected with unidirectional edges in a single large OrthNet, due to duplicated paralogues, lineage-specific deletions, and partial gene models that lead to non-reciprocal best-hit pairs. We employed two methods to alleviate this issue. First, for all unidirectional edges from node A to node B, ONfinder searches for an alternative best-hit for B, among the list of the ten best-hit candidates, that makes A and B a reciprocal best-hit pair (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘update_BestHitPairs.py’). The best-hit candidates were obtained by running BLASTN with the ‘-max_target_seqs 10’ option when creating the Input 2 for the CLfinder module. The ONfinder module records how many best-hit candidates it tested before identifying a reciprocal best-hit pair (Supplmentary Dataset S1, legend). Only when a reciprocal best-hit does not exist among all ten alternatives, the OrthNet will have a unidirectional edge. Second, each OrthNet is subjected to further clustering to finer OrthNets using Markov Chain Clustering (MCL),54 with an inflation parameter (1.2) and a higher edge weight given in the order of td (1.5), reciprocal cl (1.2), unidirectional cl (0.6), reciprocal tr (0.5), and unidirectional tr (0.25) edges (default edge weight values used in this study are in parentheses). Edge weights for the MCL process were decided as detailed in Supplementary Text S2 and Fig. S4, with the following aims: (i) to separate networks of out-paralogues derived from multiple loci duplicated prior to the divergence of the six target genomes (as exemplified in Supplementary Fig. S4), while (ii) keeping paralogues that underwent tandem duplication (td), transposition–duplication (tr–d), and combinations of td and tr–d, together with the core set of co-linear orthologues in the same OrthNet. Once an OrthNet was separated into multiple smaller OrthNets, any edge removed by MCL was replaced by an alternative edge connecting nodes within each of new OrthNets, by searching for an alternative best-hit pair among the list of ten best-hit candidates (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The ONfinder module records the number of best-hit candidates tested before the final edge was decided (Supplementary Dataset S1). The MCL process effectively removed spurious unidirectional edges that connect nodes from different loci (Supplementary Fig. S2. ‘update_OrthNet_afterMCL.py’, see also Supplementary Text S2 and Fig. S4 for detailed discussion and an example). The final network units (OrthNets) were converted to the Simple Interaction File (SIF) format for visualization using Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/ (10 October 2018, date last accessed)). All OrthNets derived from this analysis are included as archived SIFs (Supplementary Dataset S2).2.4. Searching OrthNets that share an evolutionary historyWhile CLfinder and ONfinder can operate independently, when used in a pipeline, the ONfinder module adds the results of its analysis to the CLfinder result for each locus (Supplementary Dataset S1). For each gene locus that belonged to an OrthNet, ONfinder adds the unique ID of the OrthNet that includes the locus, number of nodes derived from each genome (i.e. gene copy numbers) in the OrthNet, and the edge types connecting the locus to its best-hit nodes in other genomes (Supplementary Dataset S1). This information enabled identifying OrthNets with the same or similar topologies that represent the same set of evolutionary events.The ONfinder module offers two methods to search OrthNets (Supplementary Fig. S2). To systematically identify OrthNets including tr–d events uniquely found in subsets of the six crucifer genomes, we searched for OrthNets that (i) showed a node copy number pattern consistent with duplications specific to the subset and (ii) contain nodes that are connected to all of their orthologous neighbours through unidirectional tr edges. We used the ‘search_OrthNet_pattern.py’ script (Supplementary Fig. S2) and searched for node copy number and edge property patterns as listed in Supplementary Table S3, in the CLfinder-OrthNet output (Supplementary Dataset S1). For evolutionary history patterns presented in Fig. 3A, the second script, ‘search_OrthNet_topology.py’ (Supplementary Fig. S2), found all OrthNets with either exactly the same or similar topologies with the query OrthNet. The ONfinder module encodes the evolutionary history of an orthologous gene group into an OrthNet. (A) OrthNet examples representing five different evolutionary histories of orthologous gene groups derived from the six Brassicaceae genomes (Fig. 1, highlighted with boxes).

Analysis of transposition–duplication (tr–d) eventsWithin an OrthNet with a tr–d event, the tr–d donor or ‘CL copy’ was the node connected to orthologous nodes with the most cl edges, while the remaining were tr–d acceptors or ‘Tr copies’. When multiple CL copies existed due to tandem duplication, we used the one with the longest ORF as the representing CL copy. Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) were detected between the gene and ±5 kb intergenic regions of the CL copy and each of Tr copies, using LASTZ with chaining as previously described in ref. 5. A tr–d event was ‘complete’ if the HGS included the entire CL copy gene. A ‘gene-only’ tr–d was defined as a complete tr–d event with the size of HGS less than 120% of the coding region of the CL copy gene. We determined the expected occurrences of complete and gene-only tr–d by random shuffling and overlapping of HGSs and CL copy genes. Specifically, we assumed a random HGS selected among the observed HGS length distribution occurred at a random position in the vicinity of a CL copy gene, with a minimum 60 bps overlap between the genic region and a HGS. The distribution of such occurrences from 10,000 iterations was fitted to a normal distribution to calculate the P-value of the observed occurrence, using the fitdistr function in R MASS package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS (10 October 2018, date last accessed)).The four degenerate site (4d) substitution rates were calculated for all CL and Tr copy pairs where the Tr copy contained a complete ORF, using codeml53 and a custom script (Supplementary Fig. S2, ‘pairwiseKs_by_codeml.py’). All custom scripts used in this study are available at the CLfinder-OrthNet GitHub page (https://github.com/ohdongha/CL_finder). To determine Tr copies with expression evidence, we used RNA-seq data for leaf and root tissues obtained from Wang et al.13 for A. lyrata, A. thaliana, and C. rubella, and Oh et al.5 for A. thaliana and S. parvula as well as samples prepared for this study (for E. salsugineum, BioProject ID PRJNA63667) as previously described in Oh et al.5 FPKM values of representative transcript models were estimated using Stringtie (v. 1.3.1c) with the ‘-e’ option,55 after RNAseq reads were aligned to the genome using HISAT2 (v. 2.0.5).553. Results3.1. Patterns of co-linearity erosion within the six Brassicaceae genomesWe selected a set of six genomes with the same whole genome duplication history sampled from the Brassicaceae Lineages I and II for this study (Fig. 1). This set includes the model plant A. thaliana (Ath) and its relatives in Lineage I, A. lyrata (Aly) and Capsella rubella (Cru), as well as Sisymbrium irio (Sir) and the two extremophytes, E. salsugineum (Esa) and S. parvula (Spa), in Lineage II. Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic relationships of the target species with other published genomes in Brassicaceae based on amino acid sequence alignments of 14,614 homolog clusters (see Materials and Methods, 2.1).Before applying the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline, we analysed the degree of co-linearity erosion among the target Brassicaceae genomes by comparing gene orders, as detailed in Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1. Our analysis revealed that two-thirds of genes identified as non-transposable element (non-TE) and non-lineage-specific (non-LS) genes in the Brassicaceae genomes showed a conservation of gene order with their immediate neighbours when compared with the genome of A. thaliana (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1 =1). The proportion of non-TE and non-LS gene loci showing a proximal (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1 = 2–20) and distal (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1 >20 and ‘Diff Chr’) gene order displacement, compared with their immediate neighbours, was correlated with the divergence time between genomes and their TE contents, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This suggested two different models for co-linearity erosion, as summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1E. The proximal gene order displacements were likely resulted from mutations and indels accumulated in the neighbouring loci over time (Supplementary Fig. S1A, blue loci). In this model, larger gene order displacements requiring multiple mutations in the neighbouring gene loci are rarer, which explains the rapid decline of genes in Supplementary Fig. S1B as dn,n+1 increases from 1, i.e. perfect co-linearity, to larger values (Supplementary Fig. S1E, blue line and arrow). The second model involves transposition of mostly single locus (Supplementary Fig. S1A, orange loci), which may have been initiated by the presence of repetitive sequences and TE activities. Transposition based on mechanisms such as the repair of double strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining (DSB-NHEJ)1 can occur ubiquitously between any pair of genomic locations with a frequency lower than that of point mutations (Supplementary Fig. S1E, orange line and arrow). Genes showing larger dn,n+1 with their neighbours in both directions are most likely transposed via the second model. We used the result from co-linearity erosion (Supplementary Fig. S1B) to determine parameters suitable for detecting co-linear loci between a pair of genomes, as detailed in Materials and Methods (2.2) and Supplementary Text S1.3.2. Development of the CLfinder-OrthNet pipelineOur pipeline consists of two modules: CLfinder and ONfinder (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The first module, CLfinder, compares all possible pairs of query and target genomes and test whether each homologous gene pair (i.e. ‘best-hit’ pair, Supplementary Text Glossary) is co-linear (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3, and Dataset S1). CLfinder accepts three inputs: representative gene models for all loci in each genome, clusters of paralogues within each genome, and lists of best-hits between all possible query-target genome pairs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Users can select the methods and criteria for defining paralogue clusters and best-hit pairs, as well as the sensitivity and stringency for the co-linearity detection by controlling three parameters: the window size (W), the number of co-linear loci-in-chain threshold (N), and the maximum gap allowed between co-linear loci-in chain (G) (see Materials and Methods, 2.2). Based on these parameters, the CLfinder module searches both up- and downstream of each locus in the query genome for ‘loci-in-chain’ based on the order of their best-hits in the target genome, to determine whether a query-target best-hit pair is either co-linear (cl), transposed (tr), or not able to determine (nd) due to the query genome assembly scaffold being too short. When co-linearity was detected only towards one direction, the query-target best-hit pair is considered representing an end of a co-linear genome segment (cl_end) derived from inversions, indels, and segmental duplications involving multiple gene loci. A query locus without a best-hit in the target genome is marked lineage-specific (ls) (Supplementary Fig. S3).The second module, ONfinder, combines all pairwise comparisons by CLfinder and encodes co-linearity relationships among orthologues into networks (OrthNets), with gene loci as nodes connected by an edge to their best-hits in other genomes (Figs 2 and 3). Each edge has a property of either co-linear (cl), transposed (tr), or not determined (nd). The cl and tr edges can be either reciprocal or unidirectional (Fig. 3A, ‘rc’ and ‘uni’, respectively). OrthNets also include tandem duplicated (td) paralogues, connected by undirected edges [e.g. panel (4) in Fig. 3A]. ONfinder uses Markov clustering (MCL),54 based on edge weights assigned according to edge properties, to divide large networks that are often a result of expanded gene families with a large number of paralogues into smaller clusters likely derived from a single ancestral locus (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Text S2). Each cluster of orthologues, separated by MCL, is given an OrthNet ID and represented as an orthologue network or an OrthNet. Finally, ONfinder can search with a user-defined pattern of orthologue copy numbers, edge characteristics, and network topology, to retrieve all OrthNets sharing a given set of evolutionary events (see Materials and Methods, 2.4). Several selected examples of OrthNets representing different evolutionary histories are shown in Fig. 3A.3.3. Identification of OrthNets among six Brassicaceae genomesWe tested the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline on the six Brassicaceae genomes using parameters and input files as described in Materials and Methods. The CLfinder module summarizes all reciprocal query-target genome pairwise analyses as exemplified for the six Brassicaceae genomes in Table 1. For simplicity, we considered cl_end loci pairs as cl in this summary. All query-target genome pairs showed a comparable number of cl loci pairs, ranging from 19,015 (Table 1, Sir–Aly) to 24,296 (Table 1, Aly–Ath). The number of cl pairs follows the division of the Lineage I (Table 1, Aly, Ath, and Cru) and II (Table 1, Esa, Sir, and Spa), with higher numbers observed between query-target pairs within each Lineage. The number of tr loci pairs was proportional to the repeat contents of the query genomes. For example, A. lyrata and E. salsugineum are the query genomes with the highest content of tr pairs (Table 1, Aly and Esa), which correlated with the higher content of repeats in these two genomes than in A. thaliana, C. rubella, or S. parvula genomes [‘TE(%)’ row in Supplementary Table S4]. When S. irio was the query, the proportion of nd pairs was higher than all other genomes (Table 1, Sir), because it had the most fragmented genome assembly among the six genomes. The entire CLfinder results for all query-target genome pairs are in Supplementary Dataset S1. Summary of CLfinder results showing pairwise comparisons among 6 crucifer speciesCo-linear (cl), transposed (tr), lineage-specific (ls), or not determined due to too small genome scaffold (nd), with CLfinder parameters {window_size, num_CL_trshld, gap_CL_trshld} = { 20, 3, 20 }.Tandem duplication (td) detected using the parameter max_TD_loci_dist = 4.Summary of CLfinder results showing pairwise comparisons among 6 crucifer speciesCo-linear (cl), transposed (tr), lineage-specific (ls), or not determined due to too small genome scaffold (nd), with CLfinder parameters {window_size, num_CL_trshld, gap_CL_trshld} = { 20, 3, 20 }.Tandem duplication (td) detected using the parameter max_TD_loci_dist = 4.The ONfinder module combined all pairwise CLfinder analyses and developed OrthNets representing the evolutionary history of each set of orthologous loci as the network topology (Fig. 3). For an analysis of N genomes, a perfect polygon (e.g. hexagon in this study) with each of N nodes connected to other nodes by N-1 bidirectional solid grey edges represents a single-copy co-linear orthologous gene in all genomes [Fig. 3A, panel (1)]. We identified a total of 7,034 OrthNets that showed single-copy loci co-linear to each other in all genomes. Panel (2) of Fig. 3A is an example from 50 OrthNets with co-linearity found within each of the Lineages I and II while loci between the two Lineages were transposed, representing a transposition event following the lineage divergence. Panel (3) shows one of the nine OrthNets with only the locus in S. parvula transposed compared with all other species. We found 44 OrthNets with the same evolutionary history depicted in panel (4), i.e. E. salsugineum-specific tandem duplication, and 86 OrthNets for S. parvula-specific transposition–duplication (tr–d) events shown in panel (5) of Fig. 3A. ONfinder also compares the ORF size of a node with the median ORF size of all other orthologous nodes to which the node is connected, to identify truncated ORFs [e.g. panels (3), (4), and (5) in Fig. 3A]. We included all OrthNets together with the CLfinder results identified among the six Brassicaceae genomes in Supplementary Dataset S1.An OrthNet may include a disproportionately large number of duplicated gene loci in specific genomes. For example, an OrthNet showing A. lyrata-specific tr–d events included 82 nodes representing additional A. lyrata transposed–duplicated paralogue copies (Supplementary Fig. S5). Such duplication events, as well as large gene families where exact reciprocal orthologue pairs were hard to identify among multiple paralogues, may result in an OrthNet with a large number of nodes. However, more than 85% of OrthNets contain the same or less than 12 nodes per OrthNet (14,849 out of total 17,432 OrthNets), likely derived from single ancestral loci with duplications restricted in a subset of the six Brassicaceae genomes (Fig. 3B). The size distribution of OrthNets was also comparable with that of orthologous gene clusters detected based on sequence homology by OrthoFinder56 (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The majority of OrthNets was matched 1-vs-1 with an OrthoFinder cluster (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In all OrthNet-OrthoFinder cluster pairs, 70.1% total OrthNets contained the set of genes identical to, and additional 12.3% OrthNets showed more than 80% overlap with, their corresponding OrthoFinder clusters (Supplementary Fig. S6C, dashed box). An example of OrthNet different from the orthologous gene cluster detected by OrthoFinder is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 and Text S2, respectively.3.4. Characterization of lineage-specific and shared tr–d events among Brassicaceae genomesWe used the ‘search_OrthNet_pattern.py’ script in the ONfinder (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S3) to detect OrthNets representing tr and tr–d events either unique to each of the six Brassicaceae genomes or shared by more than one genome (Figs 4 and 5 and Supplementary Dataset S3). The number of OrthNets that showed tr events was smaller than those with tr–d events for all subsets of genomes including lineage-specific events (Supplementary Table S4). This observation agrees with the postulation that a tr event is a result of a deletion of the original/donor copy after a tr–d event.1Characterization of lineage-specific transposition–duplication (tr–d) events among the six Brassicaceae genomes. (A) Examples of OrthNets with tr–d events specific for S. parvula (WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 72/WRKY72) and C. rubella (AGAMOUS-LIKE 87/AGL87).

(A) Example OrthNets with tr–d events shared by E. salsugineum and S. parvula, representing two categories: (i) independent-parallel (‘Ind-parallel’) tr–d events and (ii) tr–d events with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Nodes and edges are as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Number of OrthNets shared by pairs of genomes in ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ categories, with the cladogram of the six crucifer genomes on the top. Heatmap colours visualize the rank of each cell based on the number of OrthNets in each category. (C) Proportion of Tr copies with complete ORFs (i.e. ORF size ±20% of the CL copy in proportion) within OrthNets presented in (B). The genome 1 (row)-genome 2 (column) position shows the number of Tr copies with complete ORF/total Tr copies in the genome 1, found in all OrthNets with tr–d shared by genomes 1 and 2. For example, the Aly–Ath and Ath–Aly positions in ‘Ind-parallel’ category indicate 6 out of 29 A. lyrata (Aly) Tr copies and 6 out of 22 A. thaliana (Ath) Tr copies, respectively, have complete ORFs in the 17 OrthNets with ‘Ind-parallel’ tr–d events shared by A. lyrata and A. thaliana.

(A) Example OrthNets with tr–d events shared by E. salsugineum and S. parvula, representing two categories: (i) independent-parallel (‘Ind-parallel’) tr–d events and (ii) tr–d events with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Nodes and edges are as described in Fig. 3A. (B) Number of OrthNets shared by pairs of genomes in ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ categories, with the cladogram of the six crucifer genomes on the top. Heatmap colours visualize the rank of each cell based on the number of OrthNets in each category. (C) Proportion of Tr copies with complete ORFs (i.e. ORF size ±20% of the CL copy in proportion) within OrthNets presented in (B). The genome 1 (row)-genome 2 (column) position shows the number of Tr copies with complete ORF/total Tr copies in the genome 1, found in all OrthNets with tr–d shared by genomes 1 and 2. For example, the Aly–Ath and Ath–Aly positions in ‘Ind-parallel’ category indicate 6 out of 29 A. lyrata (Aly) Tr copies and 6 out of 22 A. thaliana (Ath) Tr copies, respectively, have complete ORFs in the 17 OrthNets with ‘Ind-parallel’ tr–d events shared by A. lyrata and A. thaliana. Heatmap colours indicate the percentage of Tr copies with complete ORFs, for cells with >5 total Tr copies.In OrthNets including tr–d events, we identified the original donor or co-linear (CL) copy, or copies if the donor locus included tandem duplications, and the acceptor or transposed (Tr) copies, based on properties of edges connecting each of the duplicated paralogues to its neighbouring nodes in other genomes (Figs 4A and 5A). Figure 4A represents OrthNets with S. parvula and C. rubella lineage-specific tr–d events for orthologues of the WRKY72 and AGL87, respectively. The CL copy (Fig. 4A, ‘CL copy’) was a part of the hexagon and mostly reciprocally co-linear to its orthologue nodes (Fig. 4A, ‘Orthologs’) from other genomes. A Tr copy was connected to orthologue nodes in the hexagon through unidirectional tr edges (Fig. 4A, ‘Tr copies’). An OrthNet may contain a single lineage-specific tr–d event as in the OrthNet for WRKY72 (Fig. 4A, left) or multiple events featuring one CL copy associated with multiple Tr copies. Also, Tr copies may further undergo tandem duplication as shown in the OrthNet for AGL87 (Fig. 4A, right).We compared the ORF sizes between CL and Tr copies with the median ORF size of the orthologues from other genomes in the hexagon for all OrthNets representing lineage-specific tr–d events. We observed a conservation of ORF sizes between most CL copies and their co-linear orthologues (Fig. 4B, blue/filled dots), while the majority of Tr copies had truncated ORFs (Fig. 4B, grey dots). We also found a small proportion of Tr copies which had ORFs that were of similar size to their respective CL copy (Fig. 4C and D, pink shades). The distribution of the ORF size ratio between Tr and the CL copy showed peaks at 80–120% (Fig. 4D, pink shades). These Tr copies that showed conservation in maintaining the original size of the ORFs were more abundant in A. thaliana, C. rubella, E. salsugineum, and S. parvula. These contributed to more than 24% of all Tr copies found in lineage-specific tr–d events in these genomes (Fig. 4D).For tr–d events shared between any pair within the six genomes, we identified two categories with different evolutionary contexts: (i) parallel tr–d events independently occuring in two genomes (Fig. 5, ‘Ind-parallel’) and (ii) tr–d events where Tr copies from two genomes showing co-linearity between them (Fig. 5, ‘Tr–cl’). Figure 5A depicts examples of OrthNets including tr–d events in the two categories. We found a total of seven and six OrthNets with tr–d events in ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ categories, respectively, shared between E. salsugineum and S. parvula. Genomes with higher TE and repetitive sequence contents, such as A. lyrata, S. irio, and, to a lesser extent, E. salsugineum, included more ‘ind-parallel’ tr–d events shared with other genomes (Fig. 5B, left panel). Among Tr copies in ‘ind-parallel’ tr–d events, the proportion of complete ORFs (i.e. ORF size within ±20% of the ORF of the corresponding CL copy) were comparable with Tr copies in LS tr–d events (Fig. 5C, left panel and Fig. 4D).The ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d events were mostly found between pairs of more recently diverged genomes, e.g. A. lyrata–A. thaliana and S. irio–S. parvula. The number of ‘Tr–cl’ tr–d events detected between Lineages I and II genomes were very low (Fig. 5B, right panel). This observation was consistent with the notion that such a rare event must involve a tr–d event before the divergence of the two Lineages followed by deletions in all species except for the two genomes compared. The proportion of Tr copies that retained complete ORFs compared with the CL copy in ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d events was higher (=50%) than that found for ‘ind-parallel’ type tr–d events (Fig. 5C).3.5. Tr copies with complete ORFs were rare, but significantly more frequent than random chanceWe hypothesized that selection has favoured conservation of beneficial Tr copies to preserve the ORF in additional gene copies (Fig. 4C and D, pink shades; Fig. 5C), while majority of the Tr copies was either originally duplicated incompletely or have undergone mutations over time that had led to truncated ORFs. An alternative hypothesis is that these Tr copies with complete ORFs may have been easier to duplicate in their complete form by random chance due to their smaller gene size. Indeed, genes associated with Tr copies with complete ORFs were significantly shorter than those with Tr copies that had truncated ORFs (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7). Characterization of duplicated genomic regions in transposition–duplication (tr–d) events. (A) We identified Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) between the CL and Tr copy genes and adjacent genomic regions (±5 kb) in a tr–d event as described in Materials and Methods (2.5). A tr–d event is either complete or incomplete, based on whether the HGS included the full CL copy gene or not. A subset of complete tr–d events had HGS coinciding with the start and end of the CL copy gene without extending to the intergenic regions (‘gene-only’ tr–d). (B) Histograms and box-and-whisker plots (inlets) showing size distributions of HGSs and CL copy genes for complete and incomplete tr–d events. (C) Comparison of observed (Obs.) and expected (Exp.) occurrences of complete and gene-only tr–d events. Upper panel shows the distribution of expected occurrences from 10,000 random shuffling of HGSs and CL copy genes for A. lyrata (Aly)-specific complete and gene-only tr–d events. Fitting the random shuffling results to normal distributions (upper panel, blue curves) generated P-values of observed occurrences for tr–d events unique to each genome and the genus Arabidopsis (lower panel). (D) Four degenerate site (4d) substitution rates between ORFs of CL and Tr copy genes in different types of complete tr–d events. Complete tr–d events were either gene-only (‘go’) or with HGSs detected in both gene and intergenic regions (‘g+i’). We compared lineage-specific (LS) and shared tr–d events that are either independent-parallel (‘Ind-par’) or with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Lines and ‘x’ marks in the box indicate medians and means, respectively. (E) Proportion of Tr copy genes with expression evidences (RNA-seq FPKM>0) in all tr–d events either lineage-specific or shared by a pair of genomes. The tr–d type is as described in (A) and Tr copy ORF type is as in Fig. 4C and D (pink shade) and Fig. 6C. S. irio genes were excluded due to the lack of RNA-seq data.Characterization of duplicated genomic regions in transposition–duplication (tr–d) events. (A) We identified Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) between the CL and Tr copy genes and adjacent genomic regions (±5 kb) in a tr–d event as described in Materials and Methods (2.5).

Upper panel shows the distribution of expected occurrences from 10,000 random shuffling of HGSs and CL copy genes for A. lyrata (Aly)-specific complete and gene-only tr–d events. Fitting the random shuffling results to normal distributions (upper panel, blue curves) generated P-values of observed occurrences for tr–d events unique to each genome and the genus Arabidopsis (lower panel). (D) Four degenerate site (4d) substitution rates between ORFs of CL and Tr copy genes in different types of complete tr–d events. Complete tr–d events were either gene-only (‘go’) or with HGSs detected in both gene and intergenic regions (‘g+i’). We compared lineage-specific (LS) and shared tr–d events that are either independent-parallel (‘Ind-par’) or with Tr copies co-linear to each other (‘Tr–cl’). Lines and ‘x’ marks in the box indicate medians and means, respectively. (E) Proportion of Tr copy genes with expression evidences (RNA-seq FPKM>0) in all tr–d events either lineage-specific or shared by a pair of genomes. The tr–d type is as described in (A) and Tr copy ORF type is as in Fig. 4C and D (pink shade) and Fig. 6C. S. irio genes were excluded due to the lack of RNA-seq data.To test our hypotheses, we shuffled duplicated genomic regions and duplicated genes in tr–d events. Then, we compared the occurrences of randomized tr–d events showing complete duplication of the entire CL copy gene with those observed among actual tr–d events (Fig. 6). First, to detect duplicated genomic regions in a tr–d event, we compared adjacent genomic regions, i.e. 5 kb up- and downstream regions, including the gene, of the CL copy and each of Tr copies. In this comparison, we searched for Homologous Genome Segments (HGSs) between the CL and Tr copy loci. As depicted in Fig. 6A, an incomplete tr–d event results in a HGS carrying only a part of the CL copy gene (HGS <U+2285> CL copy), while in a complete tr–d, the HGS encompasses the entire CL copy gene (HGS <U+2287> CL copy). Interestingly, we found a subset of complete tr–d events where the start and end positions of the HGS appeared to overlap with the start and end of the CL copy gene (HGS ˜ CL copy). We named this subset ‘gene-only’ tr–d (Fig. 6A) since the sequence homology was not detectable in the intergenic region further from the CL copy coding regions by more than 20% of the CL copy coding region size. A total of 224 complete tr–d events showed a shift towards longer HGSs, while their CL copy genes (coding regions) were significantly shorter (P < 0.001, two-tailed t-test), compared with those in the 1,166 incomplete tr–d events (Fig. 6B).Following random shuffling of all HSGs and CL copy genes as described in Materials and Methods (2.5), we counted the occurrences of incomplete, complete, and gene-only tr–d events for each iteration. Figure 6C shows the comparison between the observed and expected occurrences of complete and gene-only tr–d events, where expected values were the mean values from 10,000 iterations. Assuming a normal distribution for the expected values, we estimated the P-value for the observed numbers of complete and gene-only LS tr–d events for each genome. Both complete and gene-only tr–d events were much more frequent than expected due to random chance. The gene-only tr–d events had smaller P-values than complete tr–d events in all categories tested except in A. thaliana lineage-specific tr–d events (Fig. 5C, table in the lower panel). We observe a smaller number of lineage-specific tr–d events in A. thaliana than in any other target genome. This may be a result of A. thaliana and A. lyrata being the closest among all pairs, included in the same genus. Hence, we included the Arabidopsis genus-specific tr–d events into consideration, which led to numbers and enrichment of complete and gene-only tr-d events comparable to other genomes (Fig. 5C, ‘Aly–Ath’).Random occurrence of duplications cannot explain the observed proportion of complete tr–d events, which in >90% of the cases also resulted in complete ORFs in the Tr copy loci (e.g. Fig. 4C and D, pink shades). More likely, the observed proportion of complete and gene-only duplications was the sequential result of random duplications and selective retention of beneficial coding regions over time. This explanation is consistent with 4d substitution rates between complete ORFs of Tr copies and CL copies in tr–d events. Higher 4d substitution rates, as a proxy for older duplications, were found between ORFs of Tr and CL copy pairs in gene-only tr–d events (Fig. 6D, ‘go’). This was contrasting to tr–d events where HGSs comprised both gene and intergenic regions (Fig. 6D, ‘g + i’), for both lineage-specific (Fig. 6D, ‘LS’) and indepedent parallel (Fig. 6D, ‘Ind-par’) shared tr–d events. The 4d substitution rates associated with ‘Tr–cl’ type shared tr–d events (Fig. 6D, ‘Tr–cl’) showed median values comparable or higher than the median 4d substitution rates that represent the divergence between A. thaliana and Lineage II genomes (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This further agreed with the notion that a ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d event was derived from duplications dated prior to the divergence of genomes that shared the events.Complete tr–d events also included a higher number of Tr copy genes that showed evidence of expression compared with incomplete tr–d events (Fig. 6E). Incomplete tr–d was associated with most of the Tr copies with truncated ORFs, which comprised the majority of Tr copies in both lineage-specific tr–d (Fig. 4C and D) and independent parallel tr–d events shared by a pair of genomes (Fig. 5C). Out of total 1,706 Tr copies with truncated ORFs, only 135 were derived from complete tr–d events, in which the ORFs were most likely truncated by null mutations after the duplication (Fig. 6E). We found no enrichment of single exon genes, a signature of retrotransposons, among tr–d events (Supplementary Fig. S8).3.6. Genes associated with lineage-specific and shared tr–d eventsSupplementary Table S5 presents a partial list of OrthNets associated with lineage-specific tr–d events for each of the six Brassicaceae genomes, selected based on the most number of Tr copies with complete ORFs and expression evidences, except for S. irio, for which RNAseq data was not available. For each OrthNet listed in Supplementary Table S5, we included numbers of Tr copies tandem duplicated, with complete ORFs, and with expression evidences, as detailed in Supplementary Text S3. The complete list of OrthNets including lineage-specific tr–d events is available in Supplementary Dataset S3. We described genes and gene ontology terms enriched among them in lineage-specific tr–d events in Supplementary Text S3 and Dataset S4.We selected the largest OrthNets with E. salsugineum-specific tr–d events (Supplementary Table S5) and independently visualized the extent of gene duplications using the GEvo tool in the CoGE database35 (Fig. 7). The E. salsugineum genome included six copies of SALT TOLERANCE 32 (SAT32), which exists as a single copy in each of the other Brassicaceae genomes. Among five Tr copies detected for EsSAT32, we found three tandem duplicates (Fig. 7A, ‘Tr copies’). Four of the Tr copies had complete ORFs and three of them showed expression in either root or shoot tissues (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Table S5). The GEvo plot illustrates extensive sequence similarity among all loci and adjacent genomic regions that are reciprocally co-linear among them (Fig. 7B, AtSAT32, SpSAT32, and EsSAT32;1). Similar patterns were observed in comparisons with the S. irio, C. rubella, and A. lyrata co-linear orthologues (data not shown). The EsSAT32 Tr copies (Fig. 7B, EsSAT32;2/3/4/5) represented examples of gene-only tr–d events (Fig. 6A), where sequence similarities were restricted to the expected border regions of the gene models (i.e. ±20% of the coding region size). Interestingly, the Tr copies EsSAT32;3/4/5 also exhibited intron losses, resulting in 9, 1, and 1 exons, respectively, compared with the 13 exons in the CL copy EsSAT32;1 (Fig. 6B), while maintaining high deduced amino acid similarities over most of the coding region (Supplementary Fig. S9). Among all EsSAT paralogues, the highest average expression was observed for one of the Tr copies, EsSAT32;2 (Supplementary Dataset S1, OrthNet ID ON_2516 and gene ID 20188564).

The yellow arrow marks the position of Esa|20181274, which contains a truncated ORF. EsSAT32;3/4/5 showed intron losses without compromising gene products (see text and Supplementary Fig. S9 for details).For tr–d events shared by multiple genomes, we present the entire list of such OrthNets for all pairs of genomes, as well as those associated with Lineages I- and II-specific tr–d events, in Supplementary Dataset S3. The tr–d events shared by E. salsugineum and S. parvula were of particular interest, because they may indicate signatures of convergent evolution between these two species independently adapted to high salinity.47,48Supplementary Table S6 lists all OrthNets with ‘Ind-parallel’ and ‘Tr–cl’ type tr–d events (as defined in Fig. 5A) shared between these two extremophytes. We also included all Lineage II (i.e. E. salsugineum, S. irio, and S. parvula)-specific tr–d events that had truncated Tr copy ORFs only for S. irio (Supplementary Table S6, marked by superscript ‘e’). Among the ‘Ind-parallel’ tr–d events detected, three out of eight events were associated with stress signalling or response-related functions (Supplementary Table S6, CDPK1, 5PTASE11, and ABI1). However, none of them included complete Tr copy ORFs in both E. salsugineum and S. parvula. Interestingly, the ‘Tr–cl’ category included more loci with Lineage II-specific tr–d followed by truncation of the Tr copy ORF in S. irio, leaving complete ORFs in the Tr copy loci only for E. salsugineum and S. parvula. Here, we found loci encoding orthologues of a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) type transcription factor, a NAC transcription factor (NAC058), and a calcineurin B-like protein 10 (CBL10). All Tr copies encoding these regulatory proteins showed expression evidence in both halophytes (Supplementary Table S6).4. Discussion4.1. A systematic identification of orthologous loci with the same evolutionary historyWhile a number of tools are available to detect co-linearity or synteny blocks among multiple genomes,32,33,49,57,58 there has been a lack of methods which can systematically identify all groups of orthologous gene loci among multiple genomes that underwent the same set of evolutionary events, such as gene duplications and transpositions in a certain lineage or multiple lineages that are either mono-, para-, or polyphyletic. In an attempt to fill this gap, we developed the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline. The CLfinder module detects co-linearity and transposition for individual loci, rather than for synteny blocks, to facilitate identification of single-gene transposition that consist the majority of transposition events1,22 and automatically generates a summary of all pairwise genome comparisons as exemplified in Table 1. The ONfinder module follows the CLfinder and produces OrthNets connecting orthologous genes with edges representing the presence or absence of co-linearity among them, enabling a search based on the network topology for all orthologous gene groups sharing an evolutionary history.Previous works have suggested network representation of synteny among orthologues as an effective method to combine and summarize synteny blocks identified by all-to-all pairwise comparisons among multiple genomes.59 Synteny networks connecting co-linear orthologues from multiple genomes with undirected edges traced the evolutionary path of a gene family.25 This approach has been used to compare the extent of gene duplications and lineage-specific expansion of gene families between mammalian and plant genomes.26 While the CLfinder module similarly performs all-to-all pairwise analyses to detect co-linearity in gene order, OrthNets detected by the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline are different from synteny networks59 in a number of ways. For example, while synteny networks connected co-linear nodes with undirected edges, OrthNets connected nodes with directional edges with co-linearity or lack of it (i.e. transposed) encoded as edge properties. An OrthNet includes orthologues connected by reciprocal edges as well as paralogues derived from duplications connected by unidirectional edges to their neighbouring nodes found in other genomes [Fig. 3A, panels (4) and (5); Figs 4A and 5A]. We aimed to separate each OrthNet into a unit that represents a group of orthologues and paralogues likely derived from a single ancestral locus, by employing Markov clustering (MCL) (Supplementary Text S2). We chose MCL to control edge weights to prefer undirected tandem duplicated edges and reciprocal edges over unidirectional edges during the clustering process. In this way, each of the majority of OrthNets, e.g. >85% of all OrthNets in case of the six Brassicaceae genomes (Fig. 3B), represents the evolutionary history of genes derived from a single ancestral locus as the network topology. Essentially, OrthNets enable detection of all loci from multiple genomes that share the same evolutionary history by a search using a given network topology as the query (e.g. Figs 3A and 5A). We used this functionality to characterized transposition–duplication (tr–d) events in six Brassicaceae genomes, as a proof-of-concept.4.2. Transposition–duplication as a major mechanism for erosion of co-linearityFor the transposition and transposition–duplication (tr–d) of non-TE gene loci, two types of models, retrotransposon-associated and DNA repair or replication-associated models have been suggested as the main mechanisms.60,61 A tr–d event derived from retrotransposons often leads to duplication of single exon genes.62–64 Transposition–duplication may also arise during the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair process of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), where a short sequence motif may act as an anchor to a foreign sequence to fill-in a gap.1 In agreement with this model, a previous comparison of A. lyrata and A. thaliana found a significant enrichment of flanking repeats, as short as 15 bps, among transposed genes.65 The correlation between the proportion of query gene loci showing distal displacement (Supplementary Fig. S1C, dn,n+1>20 or ‘Diff Chr’) and overall TE contents of the query genome, rather than divergence time (Supplementary Fig. S1D), supports the DSB-repair model. Higher TE contents likely provide a higher frequency of short repeat anchors required for the NHEJ DSB-repair, and TE activities themselves may also cause the DSB that lead to such repairs.1 The DSB-repair model can explain tr–d of multi-exon genes, which constitute the majority of tr–d events found in this study (Supplementary Fig. S8).Among lineage-specific tr–d events captured in OrthNets, we found a subset of transposed–duplicated gene loci (Fig. 4A, Tr copies) retaining similar ORF sizes compared with their respective donor locus (Fig. 4A, CL copy), as well as to orthologues in other species (Fig. 4B–D). The DSB repair model of tr–d suggests that the duplicated region may start and end virtually at any random position in a genome, given that the short sequence motif needed for the repair is likely ubiquitously available and can be as short as several nucleotides.1,65 However, our simulation reveled that both ‘complete’ and ‘gene-only’ tr–d events were far more frequent than what was expected from a random duplication model alone (Fig. 6C). We are not aware of a gene duplication mechanism that preferably duplicates non-TE, protein-coding, multi-exon genes as entire units. Rather, our observation common to all six tested crucifer genomes is likely a result of random tr–d events (e.g. through DSB repair), followed by accumulation of mutations throughout the duplicated regions, except where the complete coding sequences were selectively retained. Supporting this notion, Tr copy genes with complete ORFs were more frequent among shared tr–d of older ‘Tr–cl’ type events (Figs 5C and 6D). These were also more likely to be expressed, hence less likely to be pseudogenes, compared with Tr copies with truncated ORFs (Fig. 6E). See Supplementary Texts for further discussions on the age of ‘gene-only’ tr–d events (Supplementary Text S4) and on tr–d frequencies and TE contents (Supplementary Text S5). Overall, our analyses depicted the landscape of tr–d events among Brassicaceae genomes, where the majority of tr–d was incomplete, while small numbers of tr–d including complete Tr copy ORFs and gene-only tr–d were likely to have resulted from random duplication events followed by selective retention of coding sequences over time.4.3. Search for extremophyte-specific tr–d events using CLfinder-OrthNetOne possible application of the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline is to retrieve orthologues sharing evolutionary events unique to a lineage with a specific trait or multiple lineages exhibiting a convergent trait, e.g. the two extremophyte S. parvula and E. salsugineum. As detailed in Supplementary Text S6, these two genomes have been identified with gene copy number and structural variations compared with A. thaliana that were associated with stress-adapted traits.10,66,67 In this study, CLfinder-OrthNet identified 63, 26, and 14 orthologue groups, represented as OrthNets, showing gene copy number increases through tr–d events specific to E. salsugineum, S. parvula, and both, respectively (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Table S6, and Dataset S3). These numbers are orders of magnitude fewer than previous searches from a pairwise comparison with A. thaliana,5 signifying the vastly improved resolution in finding extremophyte-specific events.The OrthNet for the SALT-TOLERANCE 32 (SAT32) locus (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Table S5, ON_2516) represents the largest E. salsugineum-specific tr–d event. SAT32 encodes a transcription regulator, whose expression level positively correlated with the survival rate of the model plant A. thaliana under salt stress.68 Three of the four EsSAT32 paralogues with complete ORFs exhibited intron losses (Fig. 7B andSupplementary Fig. S9). Intron losses and smaller transcript sizes are reported to enable regulation of expression timing in Drosophila and mouse.69,70 It is not clear whether ‘gene-only’ tr–d events (Fig. 7B) among EsSAT32 paralogues is indicative of reverse transcriptase-mediated duplication leading to intron losses71 or different rate of mutation between gene and intergenic regions. Either way, such variation in intergenic regions including promoter regions may lead to sub-functionalization.2 At least three EsSAT32 paralogues exhibited different basal expression strengths in root and shoot tissues (data not shown).A notable example of S. parvula-specific tr–d, with copy number increases in complete ORFs, is the ZRT/IRT-LIKE PROTEIN 3 (ZIP3) locus encoding a zinc transporter (Supplementary Table S5). This particular tr–d may be a signature of an adaptation in S. parvula, to soils that are highly saline and also depleted in micronutrients such as zinc and iron in central Anatolia.72,73 See Supplementary Text S7 and S8 for discussions on genes involved in tr–d unique to each extremophyte, as well as tr–d shared by the two extremophytes.4.4. Concluding remarks: CLfinder-OrthNet, a flexible toolkit for comparative genomicsThe CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline, in a proof-of-concept application, successfully encodes more than 85% of entire loci among six Brassicaceae genomes into OrthNet units in which evolutionary histories of genes derived from single ancestral loci can be traced (Fig. 3B). Using a network topology-based search, we identified groups of orthologues, represented as OrthNets that share the same evolutionary histories (Fig. 3A), including tr–d unique to any subset of the six Brassicaceae genomes (Figs 4 and 5, Supplementary Dataset S3).As detailed in Supplementary Text S9, CLfinder-OrthNet offers multiple options to apply the pipeline flexibly depending on target genomes and goals of the study. The sensitivity and stringency of co-linearity detection are adjustable by controlling parameters depending on the range of target genomes. The CLfinder module can use results from any method of sequence clustering and comparison, as well as genomic features other than protein-coding genes, as inputs. Moreover, the two modules can be used separately. For example, researchers can use the CLfinder module to quickly summarize the distribution of co-linear, tandem duplicated, and transposed genes among multiple genomes (e.g. Table 1), while the ONfinder module can accept locus-level synteny information from other methods to generate OrthNets.Overall, the CLfinder-OrthNet pipeline offers a flexible toolkit to compare the arrangement of gene and other genomic features among multiple genomes. Future applications include, but not limited to, tracing evolutionary histories of a gene or gene families; inference of orthology based on both sequence homology and co-linearity; studying incongruence between sequence homology and synteny; and identification of candidate gene copy number variations associated with specific hypothesis-driven evolutionary mechanisms or traits.FundingThis work was supported by National Science Foundation (MCB 1616827) and the Next Generation BioGreen21 Program (PJ01317301) of the Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.Supplementary dataSupplementary data (Supplementary Texts S1-S9, Tables S1-S6, Figures S1-S9, and Dataset S2-S4) are available at DNARES online.

IntroductionThe prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide and currently 10–15% of the global population suffer from CKD and its devastating complications.1 Although the adult human kidney has some ability to recover from acute kidney injury through cellular proliferation of the damaged intrarenal tissues, regenerating nephrons through de novo nephron development is considered unlikely, as the formation of new nephrons in humans is terminated at the embryonic stages. However, renal regeneration through nephron neogenesis in the event of renal injury has been described in some fish species and the possibility of this happening in mammalian species has not been excluded. Members of the bear family (Ursidae) might be such species and studying how they deal with periods of decreased kidney function during hibernation (biomimicry) could be a new approach to understand kidney disease and develop new treatments.2The American black bear hibernates for up to 7 months annually. During this period, they do not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate. Bear hibernation is a state similar to prolonged sleep during which body temperature is reduced by 1–8°C,3 there is a 20–50% reduction in metabolic rate with a depressed heart rate,4 and the volume of urine produced is reduced by 95%.5 The small volumes of urine and urea that enter the bladder during hibernation are reabsorbed across the bladder epithelium,5 and the urea is recycled for production of new protein.6 Throughout hibernation the kidney continues to concentrate urine and produces renin,7 erythropoietin,5 and vitamin D 1-a-hydroxylase.8 Hibernating bears have the ability to prevent azotemia (high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the blood, common in human patients with renal function), but the mechanism is unknown.Understanding these processes could lead to creating novel therapies for treating human conditions related to resistance to the complications of CKD and recovery from acute kidney injury. The studies aforementioned suggest unique kidney features in the American black bear allowing them to endure lower functioning during hibernation and recovery soon after hibernation. They are likely in part encoded in the genome sequence and gene expression patterns unique to the bear. To address this, we have performed high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA and RNA isolated from kidneys of wild black bears. We generated a de novo assembly and annotation of the complete genome and compared transcription profiles of kidneys collected in the spring (within weeks after hibernation) and in the fall (before hibernation).2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collection, library preparation and sequencingBear samples were obtained by hunters during the hunting seasons in Maine. Hunters were asked to participate on a voluntary base and no bears were killed for the specific purpose of this study. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The whole-genome library was prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wilmington, MA) with a bead-based size selection to select for inserts with an average size of 400 bp and 6 cycles of PCR. Sequencing was done on two 2 × 125 bp Illumina 2500 lanes. The mate pair library was prepared using the Illumina Nexera Mate Pair Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a gel-based size selection to select for inserts with an average size of 10 kb and 14 cycles of PCR. Sequencing was done on two 2 × 100 bp Illumina HiSeq 2500 lanes. The PacBio library was prepared using the Pacific Biosciences SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using the ‘20-kb Template Preparation Using BluePippin Size-Selection System (15-kb Size cutoff)’ protocol obtained from PacBio SampleNet. The BluePippin was set to collect from 7 to 50 kb. Sequencing was done on 23 PacBio SMRT cells. For RNA-Seq, hunters collected kidneys and stored them in liquid nitrogen. Kidneys were first homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) and an aliquot was used for RNA isolation using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturers’ protocols, including the optional DNase digest step. Quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip assay (Agilent). We prepared total RNA for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq methodology (TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold). The first step involves the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using biotinylated, target-specific oligos, combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. After individual samples were bar-coded they were pooled and sequencing was done on two 2 × 75 bp Illumina NextSeq 2500 lanes. All raw data have been submitted to the NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under accession number SRP075217.2.2. Sequence assemblyAll data were subjected to quality control check9 and samples with base qualities greater =30 over 70% of read length were used in the downstream analysis. KmerFreq_HA v2.0 and Corrector_HA v2.01 tools of SOAPec_v2.0110 were further used to perform K-mer frequency generation and error correction of paired-end and mate-pair data, respectively. SOAPdenovo-127mer (v2.04)10 was used to perform the contig and scaffold assembly from paired end and mate-pair libraries (avg_ins = 350 and 10 K for paired-end and mate-pair, respectively). After the assembly, gaps in scaffolds were closed with the GapCloser tool (v1.12)10 (with -l 125) of the soap module. Smaltmap, perfectfrombam and pipeline tools of the reapr module (v 1.0.17)11 was used to recognize the errors in the assembly by re-mapping of paired-end and mate-pair data to the de novo assembled genome. The assembly was broken at potential misassembled points. The broken assembly was further used as an input for the jelly tool of the PBSuite12 (v15.2.20) with blasr (v1.3.1) at parameters [—minMatch 8—minPctIdentity 80—bestn 1—nCandidates 20—maxScore—500]. This tool was used to upgrade the existing Illumina assembly with low-pass PacBio data. Repeat masking was performed by downloading the Repbase TE library from the repbase server (http://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/). To identify known TE elements, we used repeat masker and repeat protein mask software in the Repeat Masker package (www.repeatmasker.org), which identifies TEs by aligning the genome sequence to a defined TE database. Tandem repeats were predicted using TRF13 by using the default parameters ‘Match = 2, Mismatch = 7, Delta = 7, PM = 80, PI = 10, Minscore = 50, and MaxPeriod = 12’. The completeness of the assembly was estimated by using CEGMA.14 The assembly was screened against a collection of 248 universal eukaryotic single-copy genes. Core eukaryotic gene datasets were downloaded and a blast database was made from the assembly before running CEGMA. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession LZNR00000000. Version LZNR01000000 is described in this work. It is also available at ftp://ftp.jax.org/maine_blackbear_project/.2.3. AnnotationThe black bear genome assembly was annotated using Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT—https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/Comparative-Annotation-Toolkit). CAT uses whole genome alignments generated by progressiveCactus15 to project gene annotations from a high quality reference genome on to one or more target genomes. This process leverages previously curated annotation sets to rapidly construct a set of orthologues in the target genomes. After transcript projection,16 the protein coding projections are provided to the ab-initio gene finding tool AUGUSTUS17 with additional extrinsic information derived from RNA-Seq. AUGUSTUS then enforces a coding gene model that allows for shifts in splice sites to maintain frame. This process can also rescue exons that did not align in the whole genome alignment. CAT also performs true ab-initio gene prediction by using a new method of running AUGUSTUS called Comparative Augustus, or AugustusCGP.18 This parameterization simultaneously predicts genes in all species in a progressiveCactus alignment, using RNA-Seq data in one or more species to help guide the annotation process. After projection, clean-up and ab-initio prediction, CAT combines these separate transcript sets into one final gene set through a consensus finding process. For orthologous transcripts, the transcript with the best fidelity to the reference with the best extrinsic support is chosen. In the case where multiple paralogous projections are found, CAT selects the most likely orthologue through a combination of splice junction fidelity, synteny and alignment identity. Finally, ab-initio predictions from AugustusCGP are evaluated for providing new information. If significant overlap with an orthologous projection is found, and the transcript provides a new splice junction or exon, then it is included as a new isoform of the orthologue. Otherwise, the locus is considered a candidate for a novel gene, often a gene family expansion. In addition to an annotation set on target genomes, CAT produces a UCSC Assembly Hub.19 This assembly hub has tracks for the raw transMap projections, the post-filtering projections, the various modes of AUGUSTUS employed, the final consensus annotation set, as well as the input RNA-Seq information including a filtered splice junction track. All annotations are stored in a modified bigBed format with a wide variety of various additional features annotated on each entry, which can be accessed from the details page for that entry. Additional features include RNA-Seq support for specific splice junctions and binary classifiers such as having a frame-shifting indel relative to the source transcript. In addition to the genome-specific tracks, an alignment track (snake track) shows the cactus alignment between the current species and other species. Browsing this assembly hub provides the opportunity to visualize the relationship between all aligned species and the various ways the transcript projections were filtered and combined with ab-initio predictions. Assembly hub can be visualized by visiting UCSC ‘Track Data Hubs’ (https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html) and then adding URL ftp://ftp.jax.org/maine_blackbear_project/assemblyHub/hub.txt under the ‘My Hubs’ tab. For the black bear project, the cactus alignment generated contained black bear, horse (equCab2), dog (canFam3), polar bear (GCA_000687225.1), elephant (loxAfr3), human (hg38), and mouse (mm10) using the following guide phylogenetic tree: ((Human: 0.145908, Mouse: 0.356483)human_mouse_anc: 0.020593,(Horse: 0.109397,(Dog: 0.052458,(Polar_bear: 0.01, Maine_black_bear: 0.01)bear_anc: 0.08)dog_bear_anc: 0.069845)horse_dog_bear_anc: 0.043625)root; CAT was run using the Dog Ensembl V87 annotation set as the reference. RNA-Seq was obtained from SRA for dog (SRR2960309, SRR2960315, SRR2960317, SRR2960319, SRR2960320, SRR2960321, SRR2960328, SRR3727716, SRR3727717, SRR3727718, SRR3727719, SRR3727720, SRR3727722, SRR3727723, SRR3727724, SRR3727725, SRR5018836) and for polar bear (SRR950076, SRR950074) and aligned to their respective genomes. In addition, RNA-Seq was generated for Maine black bear as part of this project.2.4. Gene expression analysis and RNA editingSamples were aligned to the soft masked Bear Assembly using STAR aligner (v2.5.3) (—sjdbOverhang 75—quantMode GeneCounts—twopassMode Basic) with known annotation. STAR provided the expression count matrix was used for differential expression analysis with DESeq2. The genes with FDR <= 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed between spring and fall Samples. STAR generated bam were further processed by picard MarkDuplicates and GATK SplitNCigarReads to remove the duplicates and split reads into exonic segments and hard clip any reads hanging into the intronic region, respectively. The final bam of all 12 samples were used to perform the join variant calling by HaplotypeCaller (v3.4-0). The output of HaplotypeCaller was further processed to identify the sites showed alternate allele in all 12 samples or that were genotype as reference in all six samples of one season and as alternate allele in the other season. We further filtered variants to set of canonical editing sites (and their reverse complementary). RNA editing prediction tool-REDItools was used to confirm the filtered sites, strand identification and its count was used as final count to estimate the editing frequency. These sites were subjected to confirmation in DNA-seq data generated for six samples. The whole genome sequence data of these bears were subjected to quality trimming and aligned by bwa-mem (v0.7.9a). The alignments were converted to bam and processed by Picard-MarkDuplicates to remove the duplicates from the data. Afterwards, the Genome Analysis tool kit module IndelRealigner was used to pre-process the alignments. The realigned bam file was processed to identify the coverage at potential editing sites. The sites with at least one DNA-seq sample support were included in final set for experimental validation. Gene expression profiles from embryonic mouse kidneys were downloaded from NCBI GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi? acc=GSE3808).20 Six samples representing three time points (two replicates each) were used in the analysis. For the analysis, E12.5, E13.5, and E16.5 were considered early & late age samples, respectively. GEO samples accessions of array data are GSM87387, GSM87388, GSM87389, GSM87390, GSM87391, and GSM87392. Samples were normalized using the affy package21 and GenBank accession for the probs (Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A Array) were downloaded from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi? acc=GPL339). We extracted the MGI Gene IDs corresponding to GenBank accession using mouse genome informatics database (http://www.informatics.jax.org), performed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the mouse array data and created a PCA biplot (Supplementary Table S10). To map the differentially expressed (DE) bear genes on the PCA biplot, we first extracted the corresponding dog gene Ensembl id from the bear generic feature format file (gff) and extracted the Ensembl id of mouse gene orthologues of dog from biomart.22 Only genes with homology type: ‘ortholog_one2one’, orthology confidence: high and Query: target & target: query identity (=50%) between dog and mouse were selected (153 genes remaining at the end) for mapping. Finally, we extracted the MGI:ID for the mouse ensembl id and mapped it on the mouse PCA biplot to create an eggogram (Fig. 5) and performed an analysis for significance (Supplementary Fig. S4).3. Results3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the black bear genomeThe ability to explore the black bear genome for unique features and to facilitate gene expression analysis depends on an assembled and well-annotated genome. High-throughput sequencing of the black bear genome has been previously reported,23 but only using Illumina short-read sequencing to a ~30× average depth of coverage. We improved this coverage by extracted DNA from a single male Maine black bear (JAX001) and sequencing it using three methods: paired-end sequencing and mate-pair sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and single molecule sequencing using the PacBio RSII system (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Raw reads were assembled into 113,759 scaffolds and contigs =1,000 bases with an N50 length of 190 kb, totalling 2.59 Gb in length (Supplementary Table S4). This is slightly larger than the estimated size of the panda bear assembly (2.46 Gb)24 and the polar bear assembly (2.53 Gb).23We estimated the quality of the assembled sequence by mapping all paired-end reads back to the assembled genome with Burrows–Wheeler Aligner25 to determine the mappability and median coverage of the assembled genome. Approximately 90% of reads mapped back to the assembly with a mapping quality of =30 and with a median coverage of 43×. The peak sequencing depth was 50×, and more than 20 reads covered over 85% of the assembled sequences (Fig. 1a). The completeness of our assembly was estimated using CEGMA by screening against 248 highly conserved core eukaryotic genes. Our black bear assembly covers 212 out of 248 genes completely and 241 out of 248 genes partially. Figure 1b shows this 85.5% completeness compared with 88.7% for the panda bear assembly and 90.7% for the polar bear assembly, which are all comparable. GC content in mammals is correlated with a number of genomic features that are functionally relevant, for example, gene density, transposable element distribution, and methylation rate. The GC-content distribution in the black bear covers a narrower range compared with the panda bear and the polar bear (Fig. 1c). This might be a consequence of the lower amount of repetitive sequences that is present in the black bear genome (Fig. 2). Thus, we were able to establish a genome assembly of good coverage and quality for the black bear, comparable with polar bear and panda bear.Sequencing depth and comparison of several characteristics of the black bear, panda, and polar bear genome assemblies.

Annotation of the black bear genomeSimilar to the panda genome,26 our black bear genome assembly was annotated using the Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT). CAT identified 29,624 genes (18,091 coding) in our black bear assembly, representing 88% of the genes present in the dog annotation. In addition, 2,995 transcripts with at least 2 splices were predicted by AugustusCGP, which also had at least one intron junction supported by RNA-Seq and not supported by transMap. Of these, 1,730 were associated with a transMapped gene and assigned as a novel isoform of that gene. The remainder were evaluated for being putatively novel loci. Six hundred and fifty-three loci were identified as being possibly paralogous, which is defined as overlapping a paralogous transMap projection, which was dropped in paralogue resolution. Twenty-eight loci were identified as possible false fusions, defined as having >80% overlap with more than one transMap projection. Four hundred and fifty-eight loci were identified as poor alignments, which are predictions in regions, which have alignment to a known gene but did not pass transMap filtering. This left 126 putatively novel loci. Of the 22,081 orthologous protein coding transcripts identified, pairwise codon-aware alignments of coding sequences identified frame-shifting indels in 7,848 transcripts. A slight enrichment of frame-shifting deletions was seen relative to insertions, suggesting a systematic bias in the assembly process.3.3. High-throughput sequencing of renal RNA and differential expression between fall and springKidneys were collected in the fall (animals JAX118, JAX134, JAX141, JAX146, JAX160, and JAX165), before hibernation, and in the spring (animals JAX101, JAX 103, JAX106, JAX113, JAX136, and JAX140), shortly after the bears emerged from hibernation (three males and three females for each time point). The timing of sample collection was (in part) driven by practicality. It was only possible to collect samples during a few specific periods, which were the late fall, before hibernation, and early spring, approximately 1 or 2 weeks after the animals come out of hibernation. Approximately 60 million RNA-Seq reads were obtained from each sample before quality control (Supplementary Table S5). After appropriate quality control and correction for batch effect, we performed a PCA (Supplementary Fig. S1a) and determined that sample 101 (from a male in the spring) was an outlier (see Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S9). After removing this sample and repeating the analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1b) we compared the spring samples to the fall samples. We identified 169 differentially expressed protein-coding genes with an adjusted P-value below 0.05, of which CISH, SLCO1C1, and NDST3 showed a >2-fold change (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S6). Of these, 101 genes were downregulated and 68 genes were upregulated after hibernation. Fold changes ranged only from 1.8-fold downregulation (RTN4RL2) to 2.4-fold upregulation (CISH). Figure 4 shows a heatmap for all 11 bears with the 50 most significant genes (Supplementary Fig. S2 shows all 169 genes). Pathway enrichment analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) of the 169 genes did not identify any specific pathways. However, most notable was the upregulation of three cytokine suppression genes (SOCS2, CISH, and SERPINC1) and the lack of increased cytokine expression (e.g. IL6, CCL2, CCL6) and damage markers (LCN2 and HAVCR1) normally seen in lower functioning or recovering kidneys of other species.27Volcano plot of the differential gene expression between spring and fall with CISH, SLC01C1, and NDST3 being upregulated >2-fold in the spring compared with the fall.Volcano plot of the differential gene expression between spring and fall with CISH, SLC01C1, and NDST3 being upregulated >2-fold in the spring compared with the fall.Cluster analysis of the gene expression profiles showing the 50 genes with the lowest P-value.Cluster analysis of the gene expression profiles showing the 50 genes with the lowest P-value.Because of the lack in inflammatory response, we asked whether the differentially expressed genes matched a particular development stage of the kidney. We used a method previously employed to place human cancers on a developmental landscape.28 First, we obtained gene expression profiles from mouse kidneys at different developmental stages (from E12.5 through E16.5) that were deposited in NCBI GEO and plotted the developmental expression profile in their first two temporal principal components (PC1-2). The high-dimensional expression profiles are simplified into a developmental timeline, ordering the genes in a linear array based on their temporal pattern of expression. Early genes are localized on the left end, genes with no bias towards early or late expression centre in the middle and late genes localize the right end. Thus, the unique order of genes on the timeline represents a summary of early and late states for each developmental process. Next, we matched the differentially expressed bear genes with their mouse orthologues (153 out of 169 genes) and plotted their location on the developmental timeline for the genes that were expressed in the developing kidney (109 genes). We observed clustering of downregulated genes with the early mouse genes (E12.5) and clustering of upregulated genes with the late mouse genes (16.5) (Fig. 5). The processes that take place in the E12.5 kidney are focused on progenitor cell dynamics, FGF, and Wnt signaling, which we know are pro-fibrotic in the adult. In contrast, E16.5 is very different as it involves glomerulogenesis, tubulogenesis and maturation.The mouse kidney developmental expression profile at E12.5–E16.5 in their first two temporal principal components (PC1-2) with the mouse orthologues of genes that are downregulated after hibernation in blue and genes that are upregulated in red.

Color figure is available at online version.Taken together, despite the many months of reduced renal function and downregulated metabolism during hibernation, the gene expression differences between spring and fall bears is limited both in number of genes that are differentially expressed, fold-change, and the lack of upregulation of genes that are typically seen in other species after a period of low function or damage. In fact, the expression profile of bears coming out of hibernation resembles a developmental stage.3.4. Identification of RNA-editing in the black bear kidneyOur RNA-Seq data identified possible RNA-editing in a small set of genes when aligning the reads to our assembled genome sequence. To rule out the possibility of variation in the transcripts due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomes of the bears for which we performed the RNA-Seq, we sequenced the genomes of bears 101, 103, 113, 118, 134, and 160 at a low coverage (Supplementary Table S7). After comparing with the genome sequences and filtering for protein-coding transcripts we identified 38 transcripts containing a different variant (between 10% and 95% of the total reads) from the genome sequence (Supplementary Table S8). Of these 38 transcripts, 30 (79%) show A-to-I editing, while the other sites have C-to-U editing. Almost half of the edited sites are in the coding region and five are predicted to lead to an amino acid change.According to the REDIportal (http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/) RNA-editing has been observed in four of the genes in the human kidney (although not at the same base pair) and for one gene, FLNB, RNA-editing also occurs both in the human and the mouse kidney. Interestingly, RNA-editing in 37 of the transcripts is observed in most or all 12 bears, but for ZNF688 we find editing in all 6 spring bears and no editing in the 6 fall bears.To confirm our observations in the high-throughput sequencing data, we randomly selected eight editing sites and designed primers flanking these sites that could discriminate between RNA and possible genomic DNA contamination. Subsequent Sanger sequencing confirmed all eight editing sites (Supplementary Table S8).4. DiscussionPrevious studies in bears suggest they have unique features in the kidney that allow them to endure lower renal functioning during hibernation and recovery soon after hibernation. As these features are likely in part encoded in the genome sequence and gene expression patterns unique to the bear, we set out to explore the genome sequence and renal gene expression of the American black bear (Ursus americanus).A first important step was to establish the complete annotated genome sequence. To accomplish this, we used three approaches for sequencing a single male bear with 100× coverage before filtering. This resulted in a final, high quality, assembly. This current genome is comparable in quality and size to the published panda genome24 and polar bear genome.23 A comparison between the three genomes shows a narrower range in GC-content in the black bear (Fig. 1c), likely the result of fewer repetitive sequences caused by transposon integration (Fig. 2).The new Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT) pipeline allowed us to establish a high-quality annotation of the genome with 22,081 protein coding transcripts and identification of 126 putative novel loci that warrant further investigation as to their uniqueness and possible function.Based on the reported changes in the bear kidney function during hibernation,5 we expected we would find a signature of these changes in the gene expression of kidneys collected soon after hibernation when compared with kidneys collected before hibernation. We therefore collected samples from 3 male and 3 female bears (samples were collected within 10 days from each other) soon after hibernation and from 3 male and 3 female bears before hibernation. One limitation is that the time between waking up from hibernation and sample collection is unknown and we assumed it was similar for all animals. Deviation from this assumption is expected to lead to more variation in the gene expression profile. RNA-Seq analysis identified 169 protein coding genes that were differentially expressed between the two time points. Of these, 101 genes were downregulated and 68 genes were upregulated after hibernation. Fold changes only ranged from 1.8-fold downregulation (RTN4RL2) to 2.4-fold upregulation (CISH) and only three genes showed a >2-fold change (CISH, SLCO1C1, and NDST3). Little is known about the function in the kidney of these genes: CISH is a member of the SOCS family and involved in suppression of cytokine signaling through the JAK-STAT5 pathway. SLCO1C1 is a member of the organic anion transport family and best known for mediating sodium-independent uptake of thyroid hormones in brain tissue. NDST3 is a member of the heparan sulphate/heparin GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulphotransferase family and increased expression indicates an increase in N-sulphation of heparin sulphate in the kidney. Since kidney glucosaminoglycans have been shown to be related to the ability of turtles to conserve water,29 it can be speculated that the increased expression of NDST3 in hibernating black bear kidneys protect the animals during the long period of dehydration during winter sleep. Moreover, since the endothelial glycocalyx on the vascular endothelial cells plays a major role in albuminuria and kidney disease,30 it could be speculated that upregulation of NDST3 may protect the endothelial glycocalyx in bear kidneys during the anuric hibernation.Most notable among the differentially expressed genes was the upregulation of cytokine suppression genes (SOCS2, CISH, and SERPINC1) in the post-hibernating bears and the lack of increased cytokine expression (such as IL6 and CCL2) and damage markers such as HAVCR1 (KIM-1) and LCAN (NGAL). Pathway enrichment analysis (IPA) did not identify any pathways that were significantly overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. These findings support previous observation that despite several pro-inflammatory risk factors during the hibernation period (such as kidney dysfunction and immobilization), there are no signs of systemic inflammation.31 This is further supported by our PCA in which the genes that are downregulated after hibernation cluster with a developmental stage in which FGF and Wnt signaling, which we know are pro-fibrotic in the adult kidney, play an important role and genes that are upregulated after hibernation cluster with a developmental stage in which glomerulogenesis, tubulogenesis and maturation are important. In patients with CKD, systemic inflammation is a common finding that promotes premature aging and predicts poor outcome.32Although this is the first study in which gene expression is analysed in kidney tissue, it is not the first in which gene expression in bears has been examined. Fedorov et al. analysed samples from captive bears that were either kept in hibernating or non-hibernating conditions with a custom microarray. They analysed heart and liver samples and found 245 differentially expressed genes in the heart and 319 genes in the liver.33 We were able to map the majority (85.2%) of their ESTs onto our genome assembly and match them to our transcripts. However, none of the genes that were found to be differentially expressed in heart and liver overlapped with differentially expressed genes in the kidney. The lack of overlap could be due to difference in experimental conditions such as the timing of tissue harvest. Alternatively, it may indicate that while nearly every tissue adapts to hibernation, the ensemble of genes involved is highly tissue-specific.Overall, both the number of differentially expressed genes and the fold-changes are low, but are in line with the findings of Federov et al. Although it has been shown that American black bears maintain a reduced metabolic rate for up to 3 weeks after emerging from their dens,3 a possible explanation for our results is that the kidneys already completely recovered from hibernation within the short time between emerging from hibernation and sample collection. Another explanation is that the reduction in metabolic rate and urine production has a much smaller impact on the kidney than would be predicted.Our RNA-Seq data also identified the presence of RNA editing, which was confirmed for all sites that were tested with Sanger sequencing. Several of the genes that are edited also show RNA-editing in mouse and human, but at different positions (Supplementary Table S8). The most interesting is the RNA editing in the 3' UTR of the transcriptional regulator ZNF688, which only seems to happen in the spring. This suggests season-dependent RNA-editing and a possible mechanism through which gene expression is altered.In conclusion, we established a high-quality and well-annotated genome sequence of the black bear (U. americanus). RNA-Seq of kidney samples before and after hibernation shows RNA-editing and the modest differential expression of a set of 169 genes that might be involved in the unique stress response due to hibernation in the bear. Our results suggest that during hibernation, changes in gene expression favours anti-inflammatory pathways. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of these expression differences in the kidney.The authors thank Heidi Munger, Ryan Lynch, Edith Schriever, Lucy Rowe, and Xiaoan Ruan, for technical assistance, and Carol Bult, Peter Stenvinkel, Leif Oxburgh, and Paul Shiels for discussion and critical review of the manuscript.

IntroductionLigases repair breaks in nucleic acids, and this activity is essential for cell viability and vitality. DNA ligases catalyse the formation of a phosphodiester bond between DNA ends and play crucial roles in DNA repair, recombination, and replication in vivo.1–3 RNA ligases join the 5'-phosphoryl (5'PO4) and 3'-hydroxyl (3'OH) RNA termini via phosphodiester bonds and are involved in RNA repair, splicing, and editing.4 Ligases from all three kingdoms of organisms (bacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes) can be utilized in vitro as important molecular tools for applications such as cloning, ligase-based amplification or detection, and synthetic biology.5–7One of the most widely used ligases in vitro is bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, which is a single 55-kDa polypeptide that requires ATP as an energy source.8 T4 DNA ligase typically joins the adjacent 5'PO4 and 3'OH termini of duplexed DNA. In addition to sealing nicks and ligating cohesive ends, T4 DNA ligase can also efficiently catalyse blunt-end joining, which has not been observed for any other DNA ligases9 (http://www.epibio.com/enzymes/ligases-kinases-phosphatases/dna-ligases/ampligase-thermostable-dna-ligase? details (15 October 2018, date last accessed)). Some unusual catalytic properties of this ligase were reported previously, such as sealing single-stranded gaps in duplex DNA, sealing nicks adjacent to abasic sites in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), promoting intramolecular loop formation with partially double-stranded DNA, and joining DNA strands containing 3' branch extensions.10–12 Researchers also observed template-independent ligation mediated by T4 ligase, such as mis-paired nick sealing in dsDNA13 or even single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ligation, albeit at very low efficiency.14 These results suggest that perfect complementary base pairing at or adjacent to the ligation junction is not critically needed for some unconventional T4 DNA ligase activities. T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2 are the products of genes 63 and 24, respectively, of T4 phage. Both require an adjacent 5'PO4 and 3'OH end for a successful ligation with the concurrent hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and PPi. The substrates for T4 RNA ligase 1 include single-stranded RNA and DNA, whereas T4 RNA ligase 2 preferentially seals nicks on dsRNA rather than ligating the ends of ssRNA.15,16Here, we demonstrate a non-conventional end-joining event mediated by T4 DNA ligase that we call 3'-branch ligation (3'BL). This method can join DNA or DNA/RNA fragments at nicks, single-stranded gaps, or 3'-recessive ends to form a branch structure. This report includes extensive study of a wide variety of ligation cofactors and activators and the optimization of the ligation conditions for this type of novel ligation. With our 3'BL protocol, no base pairing was required, and the ligation can reach 70–90% completion in most cases, including for a 1-nt gap. One application of this method is the attachment of adapters to DNA or RNA during NGS library preparation. Several genomic structures that were previously considered unligatable can now be used as substrates for 3'BL, resulting in a high conversion rate of input DNA into adapter-ligated molecules while avoiding chimeras. We demonstrate that 3'BL can be coupled with transposon tagmentation to increase library yield. The directional tagmentation strategy we propose will theoretically produce templates 100% of which can be utilized for sequencing. Our study demonstrated the value of this novel technique for NGS library preparation and the potential to advance many other molecular applications.2. Materials and methods2.1. 3'-Branch ligation for duplex DNAThe substrates for 3'BL were composed of 2 pmol of ON1 or ON9 mixed with 4 pmol each of one or two additional oligos in pH 8 Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (Life Technologies) as follows: substrates 1 and 5 (nick), ON-1/2/3 and ON-9/10/11; substrates 2 and 6 (1-nt gap), ON1/2/4 and ON9/10/12; substrate 3 (8-nt gap), ON1/4/5; substrates 4 and 9 (3'-recessive end), ON1/2 and ON9/10; substrate 7 (2-nt gap), ON9/10/13; substrate 8 (3-nt gap), ON9/10/14; blunt-end control, ON1 and ON6 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). The template was ligated to 1.5–5 µM of adapter (Ad-G: ON7/8, Ad-T: ON15/16, Ad-A: ON17/8, Ad-GA: ON19/20) using 20 units/µl of T4 ligase (Enzymatics, Inc.) in 3'BL buffer [0.05 mg/ml BSA (New England Biolabs), 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.8 (Amresco), 10 mM MgCl2 (EMD Millipore), 0.5 mM DTT (VWR Scientific), 10% PEG-8000 (Sigma Aldrich), and 1 mM ATP (Sigma Aldrich)]. The reaction volume was 30, 40, or 60 µl. The optimization tests were conducted by altering the ATP concentration from 1 µM to 1 mM, the Mg2+ concentration from 3 to 10 mM, the pH value from 3 to 9, temperature from 12 to 42°C, and adjusting additives such as PEG-8000 from 2.5% to 10% and SSB from 2.5 to 20 ng/µl. The ligation mixture was prepared on ice and incubated at 37°C for 1–12 h before heat inactivation at 65°C for 15 min. Ligation products were assayed on TBE gels without further purification (Fig. 2). The samples run on denaturing polyacrylamide gels were purified using either home-made PEG32 beads [Axygen beads (Corning) mixed with 32% PEG] or Oligo Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo research). All gels were visualized on an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech). An input control was loaded at either an equal quantity or half the quantity of the template used for ligation. A ligation efficiency rate was estimated by dividing the intensity of ligated products by the total intensity of ligated and unligated products using ImageJ Software (NIH). Optimized reaction conditions were used unless otherwise noted.3' Branch ligation by T4 DNA ligase at non-conventional DNA ends formed by nicks, gaps, and overhangs.

For T4 DNA ligase-mediated 3'BL, the substrate was incubated with Ad-T (ON15/16) in 3'BL buffer as described above and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. 3'BL using T4 RNA ligase 1 or 2 was performed in 1× RNA ligase buffer (NEB) with either 20% DMSO or 25% PEG. All ligation products were assayed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.2.3. Directional tagmentation library constructionThe transposon oligonucleotides used in this experiment were synthesized by Sangon Biotech. For the 2 transposon experiments using TnA/TnB, oligos for TnA (ON24), TnB (ON25), and MErev (ON26) were annealed at a 1:1:2 ratio. For the single transposon experiment with TnA, ON24 and ON26 were annealed at a 1:1 ratio. For the Y (TnA&TnB) transposon experiment, ON24 and ON27 were annealed at a 1:1 ratio.Transposon assembly was performed by mixing 100 pmol of pre-annealed adapters, 7 µl of Tn5 transposase, and sufficient glycerol to obtain a total 20 -µl reaction, which was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. Tagmentation of genomic DNA (Coriell 12878) was performed in 20 -µl reactions containing 100 ng of gDNA, TAG buffer (homemade), and 1 µl of the assembled transposon. The reaction was incubated at 55°C for 10 min; 40 µl of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma) was then added to remove the transposon complex from tagmented DNA, and DNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). The gap ligation of AdB (ON28 and ON29) to the tagmented DNA was performed at 25°C for 1 h in reactions containing 100 pmol of the adapter, 600 U of T4 DNA ligase (Enzymatics, Inc.), and 3'BL buffer. Reactions were purified using AMPure XP beads. PCR amplification of tagmented and gap-ligated DNA was performed in 50 -µl reactions containing 2 µl of the tagmented or gap-ligated DNA, TAB buffer, 1 µl TruePrep Amplify Enzyme (Vazyme), 200 mM dNTPs (Enzymatics, Inc.), and 400 mM each of primers Pr-A and Pr-B. Tagmented reactions were incubated as follows: 72°C for 3 min; 98°C for 30 s; 8 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min; and 72°C for a 10-min extension. 3'BL-ligated reactions were run using the same program without the initial 3 min extension at 72°C. PCR reactions using either prA (ON30) or both prA and prB (ON31) were purified using AMPure XP beads. Purified products were quantified using the Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Invitrogen).3. Results3.1. 3' Branch ligation: a novel method to ligate non-complementary DNA endsConventionally, DNA ligation involves the joining of the 5'PO4 and 3'OH DNA ends of cohesive or blunt-ended fragments. Cohesive-end ligation is generally faster and less dependent on enzyme concentration compared with blunt-end joining. Both processes can be catalysed by bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase, which uses ATP as an energy-yielding cofactor and requires Mg2+.8 T4 DNA ligase was also reported to ligate specific or degenerate single-stranded oligos to partially single-stranded substrates through hybridization.17,18 Here, we demonstrated a non-conventional T4 DNA ligase-mediated ligation that does not require complimentary base pairing and can ligate a blunt-end DNA donor to the 3'OH end of a duplex DNA acceptor at 3'-recessed strands, gaps, or nicks (Fig. 1a). Therefore, we use the term 3'-branch ligation (3'BL) to describe these ligations. The synthetic donor DNA we used contained a 5' blunt duplex end and a 3' ssDNA end. The acceptor substrates contained one of the following structures: a dephosphorylated nick, a 1- or 8-nt gap, or a 3' 36-nt 3'-recessed end (Supplementary Table S1). T4 ligase helps to join the 5'PO4 of the donor strand to the sole ligatable 3'OH of the acceptor strand to form a branch-shaped ligation product.To optimize the ligation efficiency, we extensively tested a number of factors that affect general ligation efficiency, including the adapter: DNA substrate ratio, T4 ligase quantity, final ATP concentration, Mg2+ concentration, pH, incubation time, and different additives, such as polyethyleneglycol-8000 (PEG-8000) and single-stranded binding protein (SSB) (Supplementary Fig. S2, data not shown). Adding PEG-8000 to a final concentration of 10% substantially increased the ligation efficiency by 2- to 10-fold (Supplementary Fig. S1). A large range of ATP concentrations (from 1 µM to 1 mM in Supplementary Fig. S2a) and Mg2+ concentrations (3–10 mM, data not shown) were compatible with the 3'BL. The ligase quantity needed for 3'BL was comparable with that for blunt-end ligation. In our optimized conditions, we used donor: substrate DNA molar ratios of 30–100, and we performed the reactions at 37°C for 1 h at pH 7.8 with 1 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 10% PEG-8000. The ligation of the same donors to blunt-end substrates and ligase-free reactions were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The ligation donor (Ad-G) is double-stranded on one end (5' phosphorylated and 3' dideoxy protected) and single-stranded (3' dideoxy protected) on the other end (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table S1). The ligation substrates are composed of the same bottom strand (ON1) with different top strands to compose nick, gap, and overhang structures. To quantify ligation product yields, the reaction products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1b). Ligation efficiency was calculated as the ratio of product to substrate intensity using ImageJ (Fig. 1b and c). The experiments were repeated multiple times with very similar ligation efficiency (data not shown). The 3'-recessive ligation (lane 11 in Fig. 1b) appeared ~90% complete, which is even higher than the blunt-end ligation control (lane 14, 72.74%) and suggests remarkably high ligation efficiency with 3'-recessive DNA ends. The 1- or 8-nt gap substrates (lanes 5 and 8) showed good ligation efficiency of ~45%. Nick ligation (lane 2) efficiency was the lowest at ~13%. However, this ligation yield was improved when the nick ligation reaction was incubated longer (data not shown), suggesting slower kinetics for the nick ligation reaction.We also extended our study to different adapter and substrate sequences using the optimized reaction condition (Fig. 2). The 5'PO4 ends of three different adapters (Ad-T, Ad-A, or Ad-GA in Supplementary Table S1) contained either a single T or A or the dinucleotide GA at the ligation junction before a consensus CTGCTGA sequence. These 5'PO4 ends were individually ligated to the 3'OH ends of acceptor templates with a T at the ligation junction. Overall, high ligation efficiency (70–90%) was seen in most cases except for nick ligations or 3'BL using Ad-GA (Fig. 2f), thus indicating some nucleotide preference of T4 DNA ligase at the ligation junctions. Independent of the adapter and substrate sequences, the 3'-recessive end or gap ligations always showed better efficiencies (60–90%), whereas the nick ligation was fairly inefficient, in a 1-h incubation. We hypothesize that these discrepancies in ligation efficiency are due to the DNA bending where the nick/gap/overhang starts and exposes the 3'OH group for ligation. The longer ssDNA region likely makes the 3' termini more accessible in the ligation and results in higher ligation efficiency. We also tested whether a similar end-joining event could occur as 5' branch ligation. In contrast to 3'BL, no obvious ligation of a blunt-end adapter to the 5'PO4 end at the gap or the 5'-recessive end was observed (data not shown). This result suggests greater steric hindrance of T4 DNA ligase at the donor’s 5' termini compared with 3' termini.3.2. 3' Branch ligation to ligate DNA to RNAWe further investigated 3'BL on DNA/RNA hybrids (ON-21/ON-23 in Supplementary Table S1) that form one DNA and one RNA 3'-recessive end (Fig. 3a). Ligation on DNA/DNA hybrids served as a positive control, whereas negative ligation controls included DNA/RNA hybrids, ssDNA, or ssRNA oligos incubated individually or with adapters (lanes 3, 4, and 5 in Fig. 3c and data not shown). Interestingly, when DNA/RNA hybrids were incubated with a blunt-end dsDNA donor, we observed a size change of the RNA oligo from the original 29–49 nt upon ligation. However, the DNA substrate remained unchanged (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3c). This result suggests that the blunt-end dsDNA donor ligated to the 3'-end of RNA but not to the 3'-end of DNA. As a positive control, DNA/DNA hybrids with 3'-recessive ends on each side showed band shifts to larger species on both strands with nearly 100% efficiency (data not shown). To confirm that the 3'-recessive structure was needed for 3'BL, we performed the same ligation reaction while replacing the original DNA oligo (ON-21) with another long DNA template (ON-23) that is not complimentary to ON-22 RNA (Fig. 3b). Unsurprisingly, no ligation was observed using the ON-23 DNA template (lanes 10–13 in Fig. 3c). Our finding indicates that T4 DNA ligase can promote 3'BL on DNA/RNA hybrids in our optimal conditions and that this activity has certain steric substrate preferences that may be affected by differences in T4 DNA ligase–substrate binding affinities.3' Branch ligation at the 3' end of RNA in DNA/RNA hybrid.

In both tests, T4 RNA ligase 1 and T4 RNA ligase 2 slightly ligated the blunt end adapters to the 3' end of RNA in a DNA/RNA hybrid. Notably, in the RNA-only controls, T4 RNA ligase 2 could join a blunt-end dsDNA adapter to ssRNA. In conclusion, T4 DNA ligase, but not T4 RNA ligases, is competent to efficiently ligate blunt-end dsDNA to the 3' end of RNA through 3'BL.3.3. Directional tagmentation library constructionBecause 3'BL is useful for ligating adapters to several genomic structures with high efficiency, we explored its application in NGS workflows. Transposon-based library construction is rapid and consumes less input DNA compared with conventional NGS library preparation. However, using commercial transposon-based library preparation systems, only half of tagged molecules are flanked by two different adapter sequences (Fig. 4a), and tagged DNA is flanked by self-complementary regions that could form stable hairpin structures and compromise sequencing quality.19 In addition, the PCR-mediated incorporation of adapter sequences has not been adapted for whole-genome sequencing or PCR-free NGS library construction.(a–c) Schematic representation of three transposon tagmentation methods followed by PCR amplification using Pr-A (blue arrow) and Pr-B (green arrow). Two-transposon method (a); one Y transposon tagmentation with 3'-gap filling (b); one-transposon method with adapter ligation at 3'-gap (c).

(d) Graph of amplification signal after purification using pr-A or pr-A with pr-B after the various tagmentation and gap ligation conditions.To overcome these limitations, we developed a new protocol for transposon-based NGS library construction by incorporating 3'BL. Both Tn5 and MuA transposons work through a ‘cut and paste’ mechanism, in which a transposon adapter sequence is end-joined to the 5'-end of target DNA to create a 9 or 5-bp gap, respectively, at the 3'-end of the genomic DNA (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, 3'BL can be used to add another adapter sequence to the 3'-end of genomic DNA at the gap to complete the directional adapter ligation (Fig. 4c). We used Tn5 transposons in this manuscript to compare the efficiency of the single-tagmentation + 3'BL approach (Fig. 4c) to that of a double-tagmentation approach, which uses the two different Tn5-based adapters TnA and TnB (Fig. 4a), and to that of another directional single-tagmentation strategy using Y adapters that contain two different adapter sequences (Fig. 4b). Human genomic DNA was incubated with equimolar amounts of TnA and TnB transposome complexes, with the TnA transposome complex alone, or with the TnY (TnA/B) transposome complex. The product of TnA transposome-only fragmentation was further used as a template for 3'BL with the blunt-end adapter AdB, which shares a common adapter sequence with TnB. PCR amplification was performed using two primers, Pr-A and Pr-B, designed to recognize the TnA and AdB/TnB adapters, respectively. The quantification data suggested that TnA&AdB had the highest efficiency compared with TnA&TnB and TnY (TnA/B) (Fig. 4d). No significant amplification was observed when only one primer specific to TnA adapter was used (Fig. 4d). As expected due to PCR suppression, the TnA 3'BL approach, the double-tagmentation approach, and the TnY approach all showed significantly higher PCR efficiency than the tagmentation reaction with only the TnA or TnB transposome complex alone (Fig. 4d).We also sequenced these libraries using BGI’s DNA nanoball-based sequencing platform and compared the base-positional bias among the transposon-interfered end, the 3'BL end, and the regular TA ligation end (Fig. 5). It is obvious that the positional bias at the 3'BL end is less than that at the Tn5 end (Fig. 5a and b), which occurs because the 3'BL end is influenced by both transposon interruption and 3'BL. Because only the first 6 nt (positions 1–6) of the 3'BL end showed base bias and the bias was similar to but not exactly the same as that of its hybridized Tn5 end (positions 30–35, after the 9-nt overhang), we conclude that the positional bias we observed at the 3'BL end is mainly caused by the Tn5 transposon. Therefore, 3'BL causes minimal bias and is similar to regular TA ligation (Fig. 5c).Base distribution bias of Tn5-gap ligation (a), two transposons (b), and regular TA ligation (c).

DiscussionOne important property of T4 DNA ligase is its efficient joining of blunt-end dsDNA,20,21 which has not been observed with other DNA ligases. This ligase was also reported to mediate some unusual catalytic events, such as ligating single-strand gaps or mismatched bases in duplex DNA,10,11 forming a stem-loop molecule from partially double-stranded DNA,12 or inefficiently ligating ssDNA in a template-independent manner.14Here, we demonstrated that T4 DNA ligase catalysed the joining of blunt-end dsDNA to the 3'OH end of dsDNA with a nick and the joining of partially single-strand duplex DNA with a gap or 3'-recessed end. In contrast, no ligation to the 5'PO4 end at the 5'-recessed ends or in the gaps was observed (data not shown). This indicates that after binding to the 5'PO4 end of the dsDNA adapter, T4 DNA ligase can access the recessed 3' end in the target DNA when DNA bends and exposes the 3'OH end. Unlike the mismatched or gapped ligation in previous reports,10–13 no base pairing of the donor DNA to the acceptor DNA was required with our 3'BL method. Moreover, even for a 1-nt gap, greater than 70% completion was accomplished using optimized conditions, while other template-independent ligation was of very low yield and was only detected by qPCR measurement.14However, different 3'BL ligation efficiencies were observed for ligating 5' T, A, or GA to 3' T (Fig. 2), which indicates some sequence preference at the ligation junction. Despite the recognized ligation bias,22 T4 DNA ligase is commonly used in the adapter addition step during NGS library preparation. With its ability to perform 3'BL, T4 ligase can ligate adapters to several genomic structures that were previously considered unligatable, resulting in a higher template usage rate. For example, 3'BL can be coupled with single transposon tagmentation. The traditional double-transposon strategy has only 50% of the tagmented molecules that are amenable for the following amplification step. However, when DNA tagmentation is performed using one transposon with subsequent 3'BL, an increased yield of molecules with different adapters on each insert end can be acquired (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the tagmented 3'BL products can be directly loaded on Illumina’s flow cell as PCR free WGS libraries, which was difficult to achieve using double-transposon strategy. Other directional transposon protocols have been proposed using a Y transposon composed of two different adapter sequences23 or replacing the unlinked strand from a single transposon with a second adapter oligo followed by gap filling and ligation.24,25 However, these approaches continue to preserve the inverted adapter sequences and/or cannot insert sample barcodes adjacent to genomic DNA as the tagmented 3'BL protocol can. We performed a proof-of-concept study of a new directional tagmentation protocol for NGS library construction that eliminates inverted adapters and allows sample barcode insertion adjacent to genomic DNA. 3'BL after single transposon tagmentation can theoretically achieve 100% usable template, and our empirical data demonstrate that the new approach produced higher yield compared with traditional double transposon or Y transposon tagmentation. There are several explanations that the actual efficiency in Fig. 4d did not achieve 100%: The products of TnA&TnB contained not only the correct PCR products from Primer A and B, but also the incorrect ones from single primer A or B (blue bars from Fig. 4d). Therefore, the process efficiency increase might be underestimated, if we directly compare the PCR yield of TnA&TnB to that of TnA&AdB. On top of that, The AdB used in this test was not the adapters (Ad-T or Ad-A) with highest ligation efficiency, because we had to match the sequences from TnA/TnB and TnY for direct comparison. Wang et al. later changed the adapter sequence to achieve better process efficiency and described it in their stLFR paper. Based on NGS data, the 3'BL ligated genomic ends also demonstrated fewer positions with positional base composition bias, and the first 6-nt bias was mild and mainly caused by transposon insertion, suggesting that 3'BL has minimal positional bias. Using this new library construction method, Wang et al. successfully achieved highly accurate and complete variant calling in WGS and near-perfect phasing of variants into long contigs with N50 size up to 23.4 mb for long fragment reading (BioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/324392). 3'BL was also incorporated in a novel mate-pair NGS library workflow to effectively cut down the laboratory steps and costs by Dong et al. (BioRxiv, http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/400689).In this study, we also investigated 3'BL using templates of a chimeric DNA/RNA duplex that forms a 5' DNA and a 5' RNA overhang (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, blunt-ended dsDNA was efficiently ligated to the 3' termini of RNA, but not DNA, suggesting that T4 ligase has a ternary complex formation preference. The ligation efficiency was greatly reduced if T4 RNA ligase I or II was used to join the ends. Some preliminary yet important applications of 3'BL with T4 DNA ligase are 3' end labelling of RNA, the enrichment of mRNA or the construction of targeted RNA libraries, especially for miRNAs, the small regulatory RNAs whose uncontrolled expression leads to a number of diseases.26,27 Thus, our 3'BL technique can be readily applied to the detection of cancer or Alzheimer’s disease by monitoring targeted miRNA. Hybridization with DNA probes targeting the Poly(A) tail or specific miRNA sequences can be used to create DNA-RNA hybrids with a RNA 3'-recessive end, which is followed by ligation of RNA to adapter sequences with sample and/or UID barcodes through 3'BL. These common sequences can then be reverse transcribed to produce the cDNA of targeted RNA sequences. Compared with current miRNA capture technologies, the use of 3'BL mediated by T4 DNA ligase could potentially provide several advantages for NGS RNA library construction. First, hybridization with a DNA strand would prevent secondary structure formation by the RNA strand and therefore mitigate the bias introduced by other protocols. Second, T4 DNA ligase enables high-efficiency adapter addition through 3'BL, which avoids intramolecular RNA interactions that can be promoted by RNA ligases. Third, adapter dimers can be effectively eliminated, possibly rendering undesirable gel purification unnecessary. This new method could lead to improved unbiased microRNA expression profiling with simple and scalable workflows, and thus, large-scale research studies would become more affordable.The findings of this study add to the growing understanding of T4 DNA ligase activities. We envision 3' branch ligation becoming a general tool in molecular biology that will advance the development of new nucleic acid engineering methods beyond described NGS applications.We would like to acknowledge the ongoing contributions and support of all Complete Genomics and BGI-Shenzhen employees, especially Benjamin Allred for commenting the manuscript.This work was supported by Shenzhen Peacock Plan (No. KQTD20150330171505310).Employees of BGI and Complete Genomics have stock holdings in BGI.Supplementary data"

IntroductionRNA-Seq has revolutionized transcriptome analysis. Without detailed information for each of the transcripts, that is, comprehensive information on the transcripts, the transcriptome information can be obtained by massively parallel sequencing of mRNA fragments.1 Indeed, there are numerous successful examples of the application of RNA-Seq for measuring gene expression levels and detecting splicing variants and mutations in transcripts.2,3 However, there is a large flaw in this method: it requires prior fragmentation of the mRNA molecules. When the entire transcript structure of a given transcript is studied, the fragmented sequence reads should be computationally assembled to form an ‘isoform’.4 However, precise isoform information is not always represented in the assembled transcripts. If repetitive sequences are included in its internal sequence or its expression level is low, providing an insufficient number of sequence tags, the obtained results are occasionally unreliable without further validation analyses. Moreover, it is essentially impossible to analyse the relationship between multiple sites of splicing, if any.Recently, to overcome the limitations of the current short-read sequencing approach, several new long-read technologies have been developed, such as RSII and Sequel of Pacific Biosciences, MinION of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and the linked-read method of 10X Genomics.5 In several aspects of genomic studies, long-read sequencing has appeared to have particular advantages. Namely, while it is occasionally difficult to align short reads uniquely to repetitive and duplicated regions, long reads can be effectively aligned even to these regions. Taking advantage of this feature, complementary use of long-read sequencing data analyses have now become authentic methods when de novo genome assembly or analysis of structural variations is contemplated. Since the long reads occasionally cover multiple SNPs in a single sequence, the mutual relationship of SNPs can also be obtained as ‘phasing information’.6For the transcriptome study, PacBio RSII has been used for long-read sequencing of transcripts. In the ‘Iso-Seq’ method, the mRNAs are subjected to cDNA synthesis and amplification by the template-switching method.7 From the sequence data obtained from PacBio RSII, it is possible to determine the entire structure of the transcripts. However, in this protocol, extensive prior size fractionation is necessary, perhaps because of the bias of the sequencer toward reading shorter fragments.8 The procedure, including the sequencing reaction itself, is sometimes technically difficult and cannot be performed in a small laboratory. More importantly, current or provisioned sequencing throughput is inadequate to obtain sufficient numbers of sequences to extract the gene expression information.9The MinION sequencer is a newly developed portable long-read sequencer. After several rounds of updates, its sequence accuracy has now exceeded 90%, and the expected number of reads per flow cell is over hundreds of thousands per flow cell.10 The read length has also been improved, having achieved a N50 read length of more than 100 kb.11 Pioneering work on the application of MinION to RNA-Seq using R7.3 MinION flow cell and single-cell RNA-Seq using R7.3 and 9.4 flow cells has been reported.12,13 However, in these study, the number of mapped reads was limited to only ~100,000. Throughput of MinION is growing by improvement of squenecing chemistry and software, and further evaluation is needed.In this study, we evaluated and optimized the RNA-Seq procedure using the MinION sequencer and applied the update procedure for transcriptome analyses for various purposes. First, we used seven lung cancer cell lines and MinION R9, R9.4, and R9.5 for developing the experimental and computational procedure. We employed LAST for mapping MinION reads to RefSeq transcripts or directly to the human genome. We demonstrate that reasonably accurate information on gene expression levels as well as unique information on the entire transcript structure, including the transcript products of fusion genes in cancers, can be obtained using this approach. We also successfully attempted phasing of SNP, which were identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS), using a series of RNA materials obtained from representative organs of particular male and female individuals.2. Materials and methods2.1. Total RNA and DNATotal RNA purified from seven lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC-7, PC-9, H1975, H2228, VMRC-LCD, LC2/ad, and A549) were used. We purchased 14 total RNAs from seven organs, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, colon, heart, and lung, derived from two individuals (BioChain Institute). We also purchased two genomic DNAs derived from them. We conducted a quality check of the total RNA using the Agilent RNA Nano Kit.2.2. FL-cDNA synthesis and amplificationTotal RNA (50 ng) was used for FL-cDNA synthesis and amplification. We employed the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara Bio), except for the template switching oligo, poly-dT primer, and PCR primer. We used custom oligos with the same sequences as Smart-Seq2, instead of them.14 The synthesized first-strand cDNA was amplified by 16 cycles of PCR. FL-cDNA was quantified using the Agilent DNA 7500 Kit (Agilent Technologies).2.3. FL-cDNA preparation from a single cellLC2ad were dissociated to single cells by Accumax treatment (Innovative Cell Technologies). We employed the C1 single-cell auto prep system (Fluidigm) and SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit with oligo DNA, identically to Smart-Seq2. We executed the C1 protocol ‘SMART-Seq v4 Rev B’. We acquired approximately 1 ng of FL-cDNA. As a control, we also conducted cDNA synthesis from bulk cells using a general thermal cycler with the same reaction conditions. Using SeqAmp DNA Polymerase (TAKARA Bio), we conducted a further amplification (1 cycle of 1 min at 96 °C, 5 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 65 °C for 30 s, 7 min at 68 °C, 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C). We purified the re-amplified cDNA using Agencourt AMPureXP (Beckman Coulter). Approximately 300 ng of FL-cDNA was obtained.2.4. MinION sequencing of FL-cDNAFor 2D sequencing of FL-cDNA generated from total RNA, 1 µg of FL-cDNA was applied for library preparation of MinION with the protocol ‘2D genomic DNA by ligation’ and the Sequencing kit (SQK_MAP007), and the R9 flow cell (FLO-MAP104 or FLO-MIN105) or Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK208), and the R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106). R9 flow cells were used for FL-cDNA-Seq of PC-7, PC-9, H1975, H2228, and VMRC-LCD. Both R9 and R9.4 flow cells were used for FL-cDNA-Seq of LC2ad. For 1D2 sequencing of FL-cDNA, 1 µg of FL-cDNA of A549 was applied for library preparation of MinION using the protocol ‘1D°2 sequencing of genomic DNA’ with some modifications with the 1D2 sequencing kit (SQK-LSK308) and R9.5 flow cell (FLO-MIN107). For the purification steps after ligation of the 1D2 adapter and Barcode Adapter Mix, the same volume of AMPure XP beads was added to the sample, instead of adding 40% of its volume. For single cell samples, 300 ng of re-amplified FL-cDNA was applied using the protocol ‘Native barcoding genomic DNA’ with the Native Barcoding Kit (EXP-NBD002), Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK208), and R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106). We conducted multiplex sequencing of 11 samples.For direct RNA-Seq, we performed direct RNA-Seq of LC2/ad using the R9.5 flow cell, Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA001), and 500 ng polyA-selected RNA of LC2/ad, following the manufacturer’s instructions.2.5. Data analysis of MinION readsWe aligned the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of LC2/ad sequenced by R9.4 flow cells to all RefSeq transcripts of mRNA (NM) and ncRNA (NR) or the longest coding isoforms of each RefGene. BWA-MEM version 0.7.15 had the following parameters: ‘-x ont2d’. We also aligned the MinION reads to these references by lastal and last-split of LAST version 833 with the parameter tuned by last train. To calculate the coverage and identity, we used the MinION reads aligned to all RefSeq transcripts. Coverage was defined as the fraction of RefSeq transcript length covered by the single read. Identity was defined as the percentage of matched bases to the sum of matched bases, substitutions, insertions, and deletions. For gene expression estimation, we used all the MinION reads aligned to the longest coding isoforms of each RefGene. The number of reads mapped to each isoform was counted. We calculated the rpm (reads per million) value for each gene as the expression unit. MinION reads were also aligned to the hg38 analysis set by LAST with the parameter of lastal tuned by last-train and ‘-d90 -m50 -D10’ and last-split ‘-m1 -d2’.For splice isoform detection, we used the alignments of all pass 2d reads of LC2/ad (R9.4) to the reference genome by LAST. To remove pseudogene mapping, low-quality reads and alignment results, we discarded the aligned reads with any of the following five conditions. (1) Reads did not have an intron, which was defined as a gap of more than 50 bp. (2) Strand score of LAST was zero. (3) Unmapped length of reads within splice junctions was more than 10 bp. (4) Reads overlapped with pseudogenes of Genocode v27. (5) Isoforms with the same exon–intron structures existed on the reverse strand. Junctions of the remaining reads compared with RefSeq transcripts allowed a gap within 20 bp. If the corresponding RefSeq transcripts did not exist and the isoform was covered by more than ten reads, we judged the read to be derived from a novel isoform.For detection of fusion transcript, we mapped all pass 2d reads to the reference genome by Blat with the following parameter: ‘-noHead -mask=lower’.5,15We extracted reads with multiple alignments to multiple chromosomes, different strands of the same chromosome, or more than 1 Mb away from the same chromosome without an alternative alignment within 1 Mb of the same chromosome strand. If both ends of the reads were aligned with exons of RefSeq transcripts, we judged it as a fusion candidate.For hetero SNP phasing of lung cancer cells, we used all pass 2d reads aligned to the genome by LAST and the hetero SNP data from our previous study.16 We selected reads with possible patterns of multiple SNP according to hetero SNPs and counted the number of reads with each SNP pattern. For each gene, we selected two major SNP patterns that did not mutually contradict one another, and were covered by more than five reads, respectively.To detect differential allelic expression of two individuals, we used all 2d reads aligned to the genome by LAST and the hetero SNP data from this study (see also Supplementary Methods).17 First, we used all tissue-merged reads of each individual. We called the two major patterns of single or multiple SNPs from these reads as performed for the lung cancer cell line data. We counted the number of reads in each organ according to each phased pattern. To detect genes with significant differential allelic expression, we employed the binomial test.3. Results and discussion3.1. Optimization of the cDNA-Seq procedureUsing the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit from Takara Bio, which is based on the Smart-Seq2 method, we synthesized full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) from 50 ng total RNA isolated from seven lung adenocarcinoma-derived cell lines: PC-7, PC-9, H1975, H2228, VMRC-LCD, LC2/ad, and A549 (Fig. 1A).14 In these cell lines, we have previously performed RNA-Seq and WGS.16 By cDNA amplification via 16 cycles of PCR, we obtained 5–9 µg of double-stranded FL-cDNA, starting from 50 nanograms of total RNA. Although we also conducted cDNA preparation by Smart-Seq2, the yield of FL-cDNA was lower than that of SMART-Seq v4 (data not shown). We used 1 µg of FL-cDNA for library preparation of the MinION sequencing. We conducted one or two runs of 2D sequencing for approximately each six cell lines except for A549 by R9 flow cells (Supplementary Table S1). We used four R9.4 flow cells for 2D sequencing of LC2/ad. Averages of all runs using the R9 and R9.4 flow cells were 161,325 and 302,059 reads of total reads and 42,761 and 180,938 reads of pass 2d reads, respectively. We used only pass 2d reads, which had a higher quality in the following analyses. As a result, we obtained 723,750 reads of pass 2d from four runs of LC2/ad by R9.4 flow cells in total. We also conducted a single run of 1D2 sequencing for A549 and obtained 994,111 1d reads and 931 pass 1dsq reads (Supplementary Table S2). Statistics for the FL-cDNA-Seq analysis of the other cell lines are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For the following analyses, we mainly focused on the data obtained from LC2/ad but obtained essentially similar results from the other cell lines. MinION sequencing of full-length cDNA.

The average coverage or identity and percentages of reads with a coverage or identity greater than 0.8 is shown on the graphs. The coverage was defined as the ratio of the length of the RefSeq transcript covered by a single MinION read.First, we compared the results of LC2/ad between R9 and R9.4. The read lengths of R9 and R9.4 were distributed similarly to the average read lengths of 908 and 917 bp, respectively (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). The average read length of the other cell lines, which were sequenced by R9, was also approximately 1 kb long (Supplementary Table S1). We also compared the distributions of read length with the electropherogram of the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Fig. 1B). We found that the distributions mostly overlapped, except for short fragments. These results might indicate that base calling of short fragment is unfavorable for the base caller of MinION. These results collectively suggested that transcriptome information can be read on the MinION sequencer without imposing serious length bias.3.2. The analytical pipelineTo associate the obtained sequences to the reference genes or transcripts, we constructed a computational pipeline. Currently, most alignment programs are optimized for short and accurate reads, assuming the process of Illumina reads. We examined and found that these programs, as they are, are not suited for mapping the longer and less-accurate MinION reads.First, to select an appropriate mapping software for this purpose, the pass 2d reads of LC2ad sequenced by R9.4 were aligned to the RefSeq transcripts by LAST and BWA.18–20 For LAST, we employed the parameters tuned by LAST-TRAIN and aligned using last-al and -split. For BWA, we used the parameter optimized for pass 2d reads of MinION (-x ont2d option) and aligned them using BWA-MEM.20 The 532,956 reads (74%) and 690,528 reads (95%) were first aligned to the RefSeq transcripts using both LAST and BWA (Supplementary Table S3). We evaluated the obtained data regarding their coverages as the RefSeq coverage (the fraction of RefSeq transcript length covered by a single read). For LAST and BWA, the average coverage was 38.3% and 33.9% of the mapped reads, respectively, showing a RefSeq coverage of more than 0.80 (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that LAST could align the greater part of the read sequence to the RefSeq transcript, although the mapping rate of BWA was higher than LAST. Concomitantly, it is suggested that many of the transcripts were sequenced in their full-length forms. Based on these results, we decided to employ LAST as a default alignment software in the following analyses. When considering such alignment results, it is important to bear in mind that we can trivially obtain more and/or longer alignments, by using less-stringent alignment criteria.3.3. The overall sequence accuracyBased on the obtained sequence alignments, we evaluated the sequence accuracy (Fig. 1D). We found that the pass 2d reads obtained an overall accuracy of 92.3%. The mismatches consisted of 12.4%, 14.2%, and 73.4% base substitutions and insertions and deletions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). We examined the base substitution pattern and found that (G to A) substitutions were the most frequent (29.4%), although the preference was not substantial. We further compared the accuracy and RefSeq coverage between the 2d of 2 D sequencing, 1d and pass 1dsq reads of recent 1D2 sequencing (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S3). Although the pass 1dsq reads (95.1%) were the most accurate compared with pass 2d reads (92.3%) and 1d reads (87.2%), there was no significant difference in the RefSeq coverage between them. However, the rate of pass 1dsq reads was quite low on this sequencing run (0.1%). In a typical run of FL-cDNA-Seq by 1D2 sequencing, the rate of pass 1dsq reads was 0.4-0.9% (data not shown).3.4. Gene expression informationTo evaluate the precise representation of the transcriptome in MinION reads, we compared the gene expression levels in LC2/ad between those measured by the MinION reads and by the conventional Illumina TruSeq RNA method, which had been read by HiSeq2500 in our previous study.16 To minimize the influence of multi-mapped reads and differences in alignment software, both reads were aligned to the longest RefSeq transcripts of each gene by LAST (Supplementary Table S3). We calculated the rpm (reads per million) and tpm (transcripts per million) as the gene expression unit for the MinION and Illumina data sets. A high correlation coefficient (R = 0.88) was observed between them (also see Supplementary Fig. S4, showing that similar results were also obtained for the BWA-processed data; R = 0.88). To further examine the influence of the mRNA fragmentation process, which is unique to TruSeq of Illumina, we used the same cDNA amplicons that were used for MinION sequencing and prepared an Illumina library by using the SMART-Seq v4 and the Nextera XT kits, referred to as SMART-Seq (Supplementary Table S4 and see also Supplementary Methods). The comparison revealed a higher correlation (R = 0.91), suggesting that an influence of the difference in template preparation procedure could partly explain the difference in the represented expression information (Fig. 2A). To further validate the influence regarding the generally smaller numbers of MinION reads (‘shallow sequencing depth’), we randomly sampled the reads of FL-cDNA-Seq and SMART-Seq and calculated the correlation efficiencies and number of detected genes as >1 rpm or tpm. On MinION, the correlation efficiency with TruSeq roughly reached a plateau at a sequencing depth of 40,000 reads, although the number of detected genes continued to increase thereafter (Fig. 2B). We also performed a similar comparison with SMART-Seq. SMART-Seq showed almost the same trend as FL-cDNA-Seq. Comparison of FL-cDNA-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq. (A) The gene expression of FL-cDNA-Seq of LC2/ad (R9.4) was compared with that of TruSeq RNA (left) and SMART-Seq (right). Pearson correlation coefficients are shown on the graph. (B) Influence of sequencing depth on the estimation of gene expression level and gene detection. Reads for each method were randomly sampled in triplicate.

Pearson correlation coefficients are shown on the graph. qRT-qPCR data of LC2/ad was obtained as in our previous study.16Then, we validated the gene expression levels of 44 genes by RT-qPCR.16 We compared the obtained results with FL-cDNA-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq methods. Although the number of FL-cDNA-Seq reads was generally smaller than that of Illumina reads, the FL-cDNA-Seq data showed a comparably high correlation efficiency with the RT-qPCR data [R = 0.82 (TruSeq), 0.81 (SMART-Seq), and 0.82 (FL-cDNA-Seq), respectively] (Fig. 2C). Taken together, we concluded that FL-cDNA-Seq is effective for the purposes of quantitative transcriptome analysis.3.5. Comparison with direct RNA sequencingWe also conducted recent direct RNA-Seq of LC2/ad21 (Supplementary Table S5). We obtained 556,195 1d reads from a single run. The average length of the direct RNA-Seq reads was 926 bp, which was comparable to the average length of the above RNA-Seq. Similarly, the direct RNA-Seq reads were aligned to all RefSeq transcripts using LAST. The direct RNA-Seq reads showed comparable coverage (57.0%) of the reference transcripts to FL-cDNA-Seq (58.4%) (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Furthermore, the direct RNA-Seq showed a high correlation (R = 0.92 and 0.90) with TruSeq and the FL-cDNA-Seq, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5B). In contrast, direct RNA-Seq showed lower fidelity (83.2%) than FL-cDNA-Seq (92.3%) (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Based on these results, we conclude that direct RNA-Seq is also useful to estimate expression levels of the whole transcriptome. An obvious advantage of direct RNA-Seq is that it is free from PCR bias and may be able to analyse mRNA for which reverse transcription is not efficient. However, there is a limitation to this method, which is that 500 ng of polyA RNA is required as starting material, which may limit its application to rare samples, such as the subtle amounts of RNA present in some clinical samples.3.6. Applications of MinION transcriptome sequencingIn addition to the above applications, we found that FL-cDNA-Seq may have several applications that are not easily performed using Illumina RNA-Seq.We examined whether the FL-cDNA-Seq reads could be used to detect transcript variants and mutations. For this purpose, the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of LC2/ad (R9.4) were aligned to the reference genome by LAST. We calculated the distance between the detected and RefSeq transcript TSS (transcription start site) and TTS (transcription termination site), and 82% and 63% of the TSS and TTS detected by MinION were located within ±500 bp from those of the RefSeq transcripts, respectively (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). We compared the detected transcripts with transcript models of RefSeq. Although 6,018 of the detected transcripts matched the RefSeq models, 158 of them represented unannotated isoforms (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). We also compared the detected transcripts by FL-cDNA-Seq and RNA-Seq. Although only 33 (21%) of the novel isoforms detected by FL-cDNA-Seq were detected by cufflinks with guide of RefSeq annotation from the RNA-Seq data, all the splice junctions of 137 (87%) of them were covered by the RNA-Seq reads (Table 1). Examples are novel isoforms of STARP and ACTG1 genes that were difficult to detect by Illumina reads alone (Fig. 3A).

The phased SNP pattern and number of reads covering all the SNPs are shown at the bottom.We further attempted to detect fusion transcripts in cancer cells. We aligned the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of six cell lines to the reference genome using BLAT (Supplementary Table S7). The transcripts with two or more alignments that were mapped to different chromosomes, or those that were mapped to regions that were mutually separated by more than 1 Mb, were considered. A total 151 fusion transcript candidates were detected from the LC2/ad reads of R9.4 (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S8). The detected fusion transcripts included the previously reported cancer driver fusion transcript of the CCDC6-RET gene. As shown in Fig. 3B, seven reads directly represented the junction of the CCDC6-RET fusion transcript. Interestingly, the fusion point harbored a hetero germline SNP, which gave us a clue regarding the identities of the alleles in which the fusion event occurred. Considering all six cell lines together, we identified 194 fusion gene candidates (Table 2). For example, WAC-SFMBT2 and ZSCAN22-CHMP2A fusion transcripts were detected from LC2/ad and PC-9, respectively (Fig. 3B). These genes could be validated using Sanger sequencing (Fig. 3C and see also Supplementary Methods). These results indicate that MinION sequencing is a convenient method to detect fusion gene transcripts. Application of MinION transcriptome sequencing: number of fusion gene candidatesApplication of MinION transcriptome sequencing: number of fusion gene candidatesIn lung cancer, there are well-known driver mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene, which are targets for molecular target drugs such as gefitinib. There are also several secondary mutations known for resistance to drugs in the proximal region.22 For those mutations, it is important to obtain phase information (allele context of the mutations) since the clinical relevance will be distinct regardless of whether the mutations are located on the same allele. We expected long MinION reads to overcome the difficulties in phasing using Illumina reads. To avoid false detection due to the relatively high error rates of MinION, we employed the heterozygous SNV information for lung cancer cell lines previously detected from WGS using Illumina HiSeq.16 Considering all the cell lines together, multiple SNVs were phased on 291 genes (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S9). Interestingly, the mutual distance between those SNVs was occasionally greater than 100 kb because of the intron between them. This approach may enable rather efficient SNP phasing than that at the genomic level as far as the location in transcript regions (Fig. 3D). Application of MinION transcriptome sequencing: phased gene number and heterozygous site distanceApplication of MinION transcriptome sequencing: phased gene number and heterozygous site distanceBy using FL-cDNA-Seq, we attempted to detect allele-biased expression in various organs of given individuals. We obtained a total of 14 total RNA sets from seven organs of two healthy individuals, one male and one female. We also obtained their corresponding genomic DNAs. We performed FL-cDNA-Seq for these 14 RNA samples and aligned the reads to the human reference genome by LAST (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11). We also performed whole exome sequencing of two genomic DNA samples by Illumina (Supplementary Table S12 and see also Supplementary Methods). Using GATK best practices, 437,646 and 395,486 hetero SNPs were called from the genomic DNAs of the male and the female samples, respectively. Using the obtained hetero SNP data, we phased the FL-cDNA-Seq reads of all tissue-merged data. We phased 2,928 genes, and 306 genes showed significant allelic expression based on the binomial test (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S13). For instance, the UBXN4 gene was showed differential allelic expression in the female. Although the C allele showed higher expression than the A allele in most tissues of the female, only the liver showed the opposite allelic expression pattern (Fig. 4A). In the male, we also detected the GNAS gene, which has a known complex allelic imbalance expression pattern23,24 (Fig. 4B). This gene has one maternal chromosome-specific first exon, two paternal chromosome-specific first exons, and neutral first exons. Paternal first exons and the maternal first exon were only detected on the C allele and T allele, showing that the C and T alleles are on the paternal chromosome and maternal chromosome, respectively.

To obtain sufficient amounts of input template for FL-cDNA-Seq, five additional cycles of PCR were employed. Approximately 250–450 ng of cDNA templates were obtained from each of the single cells and subjected to FL-cDNA-Seq. The libraries obtained from one bulk and one doublet cell, as well as nine single cells, were barcoded and loaded onto a single R9.4 flow cell. A total of 24,817 reads (469–6,522 per samples) were obtained (Supplementary Table S14). For comparison, we also conducted Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT-processed cDNA obtained from the C1 platform (Supplementary Table S15). We compared the Illumina SMART-Seq and FL-cDNA-Seq of single cells. When we considered the correlation between SMART-Seq and FL-cDNA-Seq of the aggregated reads of nine single cells (‘virtual bulks’), the correlation was reasonably high (R = 0.63) (Fig. 5A). However, when calculated at the single cell level, the correlation was R = 0.32–0.69 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The low correlation efficiencies reflected the fact that the number of reads was small for the FL-cDNA-Seq reads (Fig. 5B). We also compared the single cell data and bulk data of FL-cDNA-Seq, prepared using the same protocol. Between the virtual bulk of single cells and bulk, the correlation was moderately high (R = 0.69) (Supplementary Fig. S9A). When calculated between the single cells and bulk, the correlation was R = 0.11–0.67 (Supplementary Fig. S9B). The overall accuracy and RefSeq coverage of FL-cDNA-Seq reads were 93.2% and 43.2% (Fig. 5C). Although the still limited throughput of the MinION sequencer is not suitable for gene expression analysis at the single cell level, we found that some full-length transcript variants were over-represented in particular individual cells. MinION sequencing can be complementarily used for this purpose. Single cell FL-cDNA-Seq using C1.

ConclusionsIn this article, we evaluated current MinION sequencing and incorporated some modifications depending on the various applications. To our knowledge, this is the first article to survey the potential application of FL-cDNA-Seq, which may not be consistently easy with the current Illumina RNA-Seq. Indeed, our current knowledge regarding the transcriptome is almost limited to that obtained from Illumina or microarrays, which generally only represents information about fragmented transcripts. In contrast, FL-cDNA-Seq has enabled analysis of the entire transcript with respect to expression and base information at the isoform level. In this article, we demonstrated that these features first could enable one to take advantage of MinION long reads to gain novel insights in addition to the current transcriptome view. A no less important unique feature of the MinION sequencer is that it permits on-site sequencing without requiring any laboratory instruments for the sequencing. Because the flow cell as well as the data process software have been improved, now the sequencing yield has reached to more than 1 million reads. In our previous study, MinION sequencing of PCR amplicon from cDNA of clinical samples was performed.27 We could detect fusion genes and phase the hetero SNVs. It is assumed that FL-cDNA-Seq is also applicable for clinical samples. These advantages with the portable feature will further accelerated the compilation of transcriptome data. With the expansion of transcriptome information, we will be able to understand how the code of the genome and its mutations are linked to gene expression.We sincerely thank Hiroyuki Wakaguri, Terumi Horiuchi, and Yuta Kuze for assistance with the data analysis, and Kazumi Abe, Kiyomi Imamura, Yuni Ishikawa, Mari Tsubaki, Sachie Shimazu, Megumi Kombu, Etsuko Kobayashi, and Yusuke Ogishi for their experimental support.Accession numbersThe raw sequence reads generated in this study have been deposited at DDBJ under accession numbers RA006943D and DRA006942.FundingThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16H06279 and JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR15G3.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionWine fermentation is a complex biochemical process in which yeasts are the pivotal players. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the leading microorganism in conducting alcoholic fermentation of the grape must, it is being increasingly acknowledged the critical role of the remaining microbiota in shaping the properties of the produced wines giving rise to the concept of ‘microbial terroir’.1–3 In particular, the activity of many other yeast species belonging to various non-Saccharomyces genera has been found to greatly influence the course of the fermentation and also the sensory characteristics of the final wine.4,5 Apiculate yeasts of the Hanseniaspora genus are among the non-Saccharomyces species more abundant in grape-musts, particularly in the early stages of the fermentation.3,6–10 Although H. uvarum is usually the more abundant species,6,9,11 several studies also report a high abundance of H. guilliermondii.8,9,12–15 As observed with other Hanseniaspora species, the presence of H. guilliermondii has a positive effect in the aroma profile of wines16–19 as well as of other fermented beverages.20,21 In general, the positive contribution of non-Saccharomyces species (and of H. guilliermondii in particular) to the aroma profile of the wine is believed to result from their ability to produce esters, higher alcohols or glycerol, but also through the synthesis of enzymes (such as ß-glucosidases) that release flavor and aroma compounds (usually terpenols) present in the grapes as flavourless glycoconjugate precursors.4,5,Hanseniaspora species have also been used to improve the content in glycerol or mannoproteins22,23 or to reduce acidity or alcohol level.24–26When co-inoculated with S. cerevisae in grape-must H. guilliermondii predominates in an initial stage, however, as the fermentation proceeds its abundance decreases prominently.8,27–29 The low tolerance to ethanol has been suggested to account for the reduced fitness of H. guilliermondii in the later stages of the fermentation (in analogy to what was proposed for other non-Saccharomyces yeasts); however, the relatively high tolerance observed in some strains30 along with the demonstration that death of H. guilliermondii cells occurred in the presence of S. cerevisiae regardless of the amount of ethanol present in the fermentation broth,29 puts in question this simple model by which S. cerevisae and H. guilliermondii interact.31 Indeed, it was recently demonstrated that H. guilliermondii death in the presence of S. cerevisiae results from this latter species producing antimicrobial peptides that induce loss of cell viability in the H. guilliermondii cells upon cell–cell contacts.32Although it is clear that the presence of H. guilliermondii affects the performance of alcoholic fermentation, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying its interaction with S. cerevisiae cells are still elusive questions. In a first attempt to address this issue, Barbosa et al. have studied the effect exerted by H. guilliermondii on the genomic expression of S. cerevisiae during a mixed-culture fermentation of a natural grape-must.27 The expression of about 300 S. cerevisiae genes was altered by the presence of H. guilliermondii, in comparison with the corresponding transcript levels registered in single-cultures.27,Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in the biosynthesis of vitamins were enriched among those found to be more up-regulated in the mixed S. cerevisiae–H. guilliermondii fermentation, while genes related with the uptake and biosynthesis of amino acids were enriched among those more expressed in the single-culture.27 Notably, the differences in the aroma profiles of the wines obtained in mixed-culture fermentations, appeared to be tightly correlated with the changes observed in the transcript profile of S. cerevisae genes related with formation of the aroma compounds observed in mixed-culture fermentations and attributable to the presence of H. guilliermondii.27The first annotated genomic sequence of a H. guilliermondii strain (the UTAD222 strain, also focused in this work) was recently released33 accompanying the releases of genomic sequences for H. uvarum (strains AWRI3580 and DSM2768)34,35 and H. opuntiae (strain AWRI3578).34 However, in those short studies, the information coming from the release of these genomic sequences was not explored, this being an essential aspect to better understand the biology and physiology of the Hanseniaspora species, specially in the context of wine fermentation. In this work, a thorough analysis of the H. guilliermondii genomic sequence was performed, involving not only extensive functional analysis of the H. guilliermondii genome but also a comparative analysis with H. uvarum, H. opuntiae and also S. cerevisiae. Exploring those comparative genomic results a chromosomal map for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain is proposed, this being the first time that this information is given for a strain of this species.2. Materials and methods2.1. StrainsIn this work, 33 indigenous strains from the UTAD culture collection having a presumptive identification of belonging to the Hanseniaspora genus were used, these being listed in Supplementary Table S1. The strains were recovered from 10 different wineries of the Douro Demarcated Region in Portugal and were isolated from grapes, grape-must or wine. Pre-selection of these autochthons was based on the ability to grow on l-lysine agar selective medium followed by microscopic examination of the size, morphology and reproduction mode of the cells. Although two non-Saccharomyces genera associated with winemaking environment are characterized by bipolar budding, Hanseniaspora and Saccharomycodes, the first can be easily distinguished from the second by the smaller size of the cells. Seven reference strains were also used: H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECTT 11206, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T, from the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT); and H. guilliermondii CBS465T and H. opuntiae CBS8733T obtained from CBS-KNAW fungal collection (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. Genotypic characterization of a cohort of indigenous Hanseniaspora strainsThirty-two autochthonous Hanseniaspora strains along with the above-mentioned reference strains were subjected to (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting for species identification. To extract the DNA from the isolates, two loopfulls of freshly grown cultures were resuspended in 500 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 250 mM. NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 0.3% SDS, pH 8.0). After adding one volume of phenol (pH 8.0), cells were disrupted by bead-beating for 30 s at speed 4.0 using a Fastprep cell disrupter (Bio101, Inc), followed by standard phenol: chloroform extraction. Total DNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by the addition of 2 vol of ice-cold ethanol and of 1/10 volume of 3 M Na-acetate for 60 min at -70°C. The precipitated DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4°C; the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in water. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 µl reaction volumes containing ~10 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer, 0.4 mM of each of the four dNTPs, 1 µM primer (GTG)5 5'-GTGGTGGTGGTGGTG-3' and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The amplification conditions used were: initial template denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing at 31°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 2 min. A final elongation at 72°C for 7 min was performed in the end. PCR products were separated on a 1.2% TBE agarose gel and were visualized after staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/ml) and the DNA banding patterns analysed using the BioNumerics software (Applied Maths). Similarities among isolates were estimated using the Pearson coefficient and clustering was based on the UPGMA method. The identification of the autochthonous isolates was achieved by comparing their genotype profiles with those of the reference strains. To further support the results obtained, representatives of each cluster identified in the PCR fingerprinting were selected for 26S rDNA D1/D2 sequencing using primers NL-1 (5'-GCA TAT CAA TAA GCG GAG GAA AAG-3') and NL-4 (5'-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG G-3'). The obtained 26S rDNA D1/D2 sequences were deposited at NCBI under accession numbers (MG832576 to MG832583, MG877743 and MG87744). The sequences obtained were compared with other sequences reported in the GenBank using the BLAST algorithm and a phylogenetic tree was obtained using a neighbor-joining algorithm. Species identification was ascribed to an isolate if its 26S rDNA D1/D2 sequence differed by no more than 2–3 base substitutions (i.e.  = 99.0% sequence identity) to that of a taxonomically accepted species type strain. Differentiation of H. opuntiae and H. guilliermondii was achieved by 5.8S-ITS-RFLP analysis, in which ITS1/ITS4 amplification products were digested with restriction enzyme DraI, and separated on 2% agarose gel on 1× TBE buffer as previously described.362.3. Phenotypic screening of the cohort of indigenous Hanseniaspora strainsThe autochthonous Hanseniaspora strains were phenotypically profiled for relevant oenological traits, including their ability to excrete ß-glucosidases, proteases and pectinases, potential to produce H2S and resistance to ethanol, sulphur dioxide (SO2), cerulenine and 5,5,5-trifluoro-dl-leucine (TFL). All assays were performed using 3 µl of a cell suspension (at an OD600nm of 0.1) prepared from an overnight pre-culture in YPD growth medium (containing, per liter, 20 g of glucose, 10 g yeast extract and 20 g bactopeptone). ß-glycosidase activity was tested as previously described.37 Briefly, yeast cells were grown in a medium containing 0.5% of arbutine as the sole carbon source, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 2% agar (adjusted at pH 5.0 prior sterilization) and supplemented with 2 ml (per 100 ml of medium) ferric ammonium citrate solution (1% w/v). The plates were incubated at 30°C and ß-glycosidase activity was observed after 2, 4, 6 and 8 h by the appearance of a dark brown color in the colonies. A non-inoculated plate of arbutin agar was used as a negative control. Proteolytic activity was determined assessing growth on skim milk agar plates, after incubation for 3–8 days at 30°C38 while the potential ability to produce H2S was evaluated by growing yeast cells in Biggy agar.37 The strains were classified in different categories according with the appearance of a brown-black coloration of the colonies, which is directly correlated with sulfite-reductase activity. Resistance to SO2 and ethanol were evaluated on YPD agar medium (buffered at pH 3.5), supplemented with increasing concentrations of SO2 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 mM) or ethanol (5.0, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0 and 10% v/v). Susceptibility phenotypes were registered after incubation at 30°C during 3 days, after visual inspection of colonies growth and comparison with growth observed in non-supplemented YPD agar. Resistance to TFL and cerulenin was assessed by determining growth on agar plates containing 0.67% of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% of agar supplemented with glucose (2% w/v) in combination with TFL (1 mM) or cerulenin (25 or 100 µM). The plates were maintained at 30°C for 5 days and colonies that developed on the plates containing the inhibitors were considered resistant to TFL or cerulenin.39 Based on all the phenotypic data gathered, cluster analysis was carried out using SAS JMP 11.0 (JMP, 2011, Cary, NC) and a phenogram of yeast strains was obtained with Euclidean distance as an association measure and complete linkage as the agglomeration method.2.4. Genome sequencing, assembly and comparison of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genome with those available for other Hanseniaspora speciesThe genome of the UTAD222 strain was sequenced at StabVida (Portugal) using a whole-genome shotgun approach that explored paired-end Illumina MiSeq platform, as briefly described before.33 In specific, the genomic DNA of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 was extracted and used to construct a DNA library having inserts in the range of 250–350 bp. Library amplification was performed on the cluster generation station of the GAIIx and using the Illumina cluster generation kit. To obtain the paired-end reads, primers were designed to hybridized with Illumina specific adaptors resulting in reading of each end as a separate run. The sequencing reaction was run for 100 cycles (tagging, imaging and cleavage of one terminal base at a time), and four images of each tile on the chip were taken in different wavelengths for exciting each base-specific fluorophore. The obtained reads were afterwards assembled into contigs using the de novo assembler available on the CLC Genomics Workbench (version 9; Quiagen) set at default parameters. The obtained 208 contigs were organized into seven chromosomes, based on the identification of seven chromosomal bands in PFGE analysis of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genomic DNA and using as a reference the proposed organization for the genome of H. uvarum DSM2768.35 To perform this organization, an iterative process was used: at first, whole-genome alignments of the UTAD222 contigs and the contigs available described for H. uvarum AWRI3580 and H. opuntiae AWRI357834 were performed using Mauve Contig Mover.40 These whole-genome alignments were performed using the default parameters (match seed weight 15, min LBC weight 200, scoring matrix HOXD). Whenever possible the whole-genome alignments were also performed using the contigs available for the H. uvarum DSM2768 strain.35 To reinforce the organization proposed by the whole-genome alignments, it was investigated colinearity between the genomes of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum AWRI3580 and H. opuntiae AWRI3578. For this, pairwise alignments between the proteins predicted for the three species were performed and the best hits selected. These best hit pairs were then mapped in the contig organization proposed by the whole-genome alignments giving rise to the figures shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. As shown, in the vast majority of the cases it was possible to confirm colinearity with the best gene orthologues between the three species being located contiguously. To get further confirmation that the proposed organization for UTAD222 contigs was correct a number of junctions (chosen in all chromosomes) were experimentally validated by PCR. While some these PCR reactions were randomly chosen, others aimed at solving divergences identified in the whole-genome alignments. This is, for example, the case of contigs 4 and 5 which were mapped to chromosomes G and F, respectively, in H. guilliermondii, but that in H. uvarum and H. opuntiae are located in other genomic regions (as highlighted in Supplementary Fig. S3). All contig junctions experimentally verified are highlighted in Supplementary Fig. S3.2.5. Annotation of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genome and subsequent comparison with the proteome described for other Hanseniaspora species and for S. cerevisiaePrimary structural annotation of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genome was achieved by applying three de novo prediction programs: (i) Fgenesh with different matrices (trained on Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora crassa and a mixed matrix based on different species);41 (ii) GeneMark-ES42 and (iii) Augustus.43 The different gene structures and evidences were displayed in GBrowse allowing manual validation and, whenever needed, correction of the predicted coding sequences. In specific, gene models differently predicted by the algorithms were manually curated based on the structure obtained for homologues found in related annotated genomes including H. uvarum, H. opuntiae and S. cerevisiae. The final call set comprises 4,070 protein coding genes. tRNA-encoding genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE.44 The protein coding genes were analysed and functionally annotated using the Pedant system.45 The genome and annotation were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive, ENA at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/FQNF01000001–FQNF01000208. Metabolic reconstruction of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 metabolic network was performed using KEGG Koala reconstruction tool,46 choosing Fungi as the taxonomy group of the genome and allowing the KEEG database to be searched for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. The comparison of the proteomes of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 with the proteomes of H. uvarum, H. opuntiae or S. cerevisae EC1118 was based on BLASTP using the sets of proteins available for each one of these species. Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 proteins were consider similar to those present in other Hanseniaspora spp (or in S. cerevisiae EC1118) when the associated alignment had an associated e-value below e-20 and a minimum of identity of 30%. Pairwise alignments between H. uvarum/H. guilliermondii (or H. opuntiae/H. guilliermondii) having an identity between 30 and 50% were considered similar, while those having an associated identity >50% were considered highly similar. Under these conditions, we could identify 3,958 highly similar and 65 similar H. guilliermondii/H. opuntiae protein pairs; 3,790 highly similar and 169 similar H. guilliermondii/H. uvarum protein pairs; and 1,906 highly similar and 771 similar H. guilliermondii/S. cerevisiae protein pairs.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genotypic screening of a cohort of autochthonous Hanseniaspora strainsPrior studies have addressed the genetic diversity of Hanseniaspora strains in French and Italian wine producing regions, for example,8,10,15 however, no equivalent information was available for Portuguese wine producing areas. Recent reports describing the microbiomes of Portuguese wine regions have unveiled a high frequency for members of the Hanseniaspora genus,47,48 but the data gathered did not allowed discrimination at the strain level. To get insights into this, we have examined the distribution of species in a cohort of 30 strains presumptively identified as belonging to the Hanseaniaspora genus, and that also included the UTAD222 strain focused in this work. These presumed Hanseniaspora strains were isolated from grapes, grape-must or wine obtained in different wineries across the Demarcated Douro region (details in Supplementary Fig. S1) and that also included the herein focused UTAD222 strain. To characterize the genetic diversity of the strains, PCR fingerprinting was used. As controls, five reference strains from the Spanish Culture Collection representative of Hanseniaspora species already described to be present in grape-musts were included in this screening: H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECT11206T, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T. The results obtained clearly showed that the strains under examination could be divided in six groups (at a cut-off value of 50% similarity, Fig. 1A). The method used had a good discriminating power at the species level since the five reference strains were clustered separately (Fig. 1A). To obtain further information concerning the identification of the strains, the conserved ITS region of a randomly selected set of strains representative of each one of the groups (UTAD53, UTAD222, UTAD617, UTAD618 e UTAD621) was obtained and compared with sequences attributed to Hanseniaspora strains deposited at NCBI generating the phylogenetic tree that is shown in Fig. 1B. Strains UTAD53 and UTAD618 were identified as belonging to the H. uvarum species, while strain UTAD222 was identified as H. guilliermondii (Fig. 1B), this being in agreement with the results of the PCR fingerprinting (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, sequencing of the D1/D2 region of strain UTAD617 that clustered with the H. guilliermondii reference strain in the PCR fingerprinting, identified this strain as belonging to the H. opuntiae species (Fig. 1B). Previous reports showed a close genetic relatedness between H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae,36,49 which could account for a difficulty in discriminating these two species with the PCR fingerprinting used. Thus, we have compared the profile of bands obtained upon digestion with DraI of the ITS region of strains UTAD616, UTAD617, UTAD620, UTAD621, UTAD222 since this method allows a clear distinction between H. opuntiae (three bands with expected sizes of 420, 300 and 30 bp) and H. guilliermondii (four bands with expected sizes of 420, 150, 130 and 30 bp).49 The reference strains H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. opuntiae CBS8733T and H. guilliermondii CBS465T were also used in this assay as controls (Fig. 1C). The pattern of bands obtained for strain UTAD222 is similar to the one of CBS465T, confirming the identification of the isolate as H. guilliermondii (Fig. 1C). UTAD616 and UTAD621 isolates, whose species identification could not be achieved in the PCR fingerprinting, were also identified as H. guilliermondii. UTAD617 and UTAD620 were identified as H. opuntiae (Fig. 1C), as well as the reference strain CECT11027T, which is in accordance with the close similarity of these three strains observed by PCR fingerprinting (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the reference strain CECT11027T was identified as H. opuntiae. The genetic analysis performed rendered clear the higher predominance of H. uvarum strains in our small cohort of strains, this predominance being in line with what is reported in Iberian wine producing regions.6,12,48 It was also clear the absence of a correlation between the genotype affiliation and the geographical origin of the Hanseniaspora isolates recovered, indicating that grape-musts from a particular grape variety or winery do not appear to be preferentially colonized by a specific strain (Fig. 1A). Consistently, the absence of a specific genetic signature in a given winery or in grape varieties was also reported in other studies focusing the genetic diversity of H. uvarum and H. guilliermondii isolates.10,50Genetic characterization, based on PCR-fingerprinting, of the 33 UTAD Hanseniaspora strains recovered from the Douro demarcated region and of the selected reference strains H. guilliermondii CECT11027T, H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECT 11206T, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T; (A) Dendrogram obtained by hierarchical analysis of PCR (GTG)5 patterns using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and UPGMA clustering method; (B) Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of selected Hanseniaspora strains (marked with an asterisk in A), inferred from the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the LSU RNA gene.

The squares designate the different wineries from where the isolates were retrieved.3.2. Phenotypic screening of the autochthonous Hanseniaspora strains for interesting oenological propertiesThe set of strains previously used in the genotypic screening was subjected to a phenotypic characterization focused on relevant oenological properties such as tolerance to sulphur dioxide and ethanol, ability to grow in presence of 5,5,5-trifluoro-dl-leucine (TFL) or cerulenin and activity of sulphite reductase, proteases or ß-glucosidases (Fig. 2). The results obtained showed a significant variation in the phenotypic profile of the H. uvarum isolates tested (e.g. strains showed a marked difference in tolerance to ethanol or to SO2), while the three H. guilliermondii isolates (UTAD616, UTAD621, UTAD222) exhibited, in general, a more similar phenotypic profile (Fig. 2). The H. opuntiae isolates exhibited similar phenotypic traits to those exhibited by the H. guilliermondii isolates, with the exception of the reference strain CECT11027T that differed by having lower sulphite reductase activity and higher resistance to ethanol (Fig. 2). Another aspect that emerged from this phenotypic analysis was the considerably low protease activity and low tolerance to ethanol of most H. uvarum isolates, in comparison with the isolates gathered from the other Hanseniaspora species and, in particular, with the H. guilliermondii isolates (Fig. 2). This observation is in line with previous studies reporting a higher resilience of H. guilliermondii to ethanol stress, specially when compared with other non-Saccharomyces species.30 The interesting oenological properties herein observed for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain, namely the low activity of sulphite reductase, the high protease activity and the high tolerance to ethanol, reinforce the interest in deepening the study of this strain specially in what concerns to the analysis of its genome sequence. Phenomic characterization of the Hanseniaspora indigenous strains concerning relevant oenological properties. Besides the isolates, the type strains H. opuntiae CECT11027T (formerly designated as H. guilliermondii but herein demonstrated to be H. opuntiae), H. occidentalis CECT11341T, H. osmophila CECT 11206T, H. uvarum CECT1444T and H. vineae CECT1471T. After conducting the phenotypic tests (in triplicate), the results were used to build the heat map shown in the figure and used for the subsequent clustering analysis shown. Strains classification was based on the results of the PCR fingerprinting and, in some cases, also based on results of the D1/D2 sequencing and subsequent analysis of the DraI restriction profile (to distinguish between the H. opuntiae and H. guilliermondii strains). Hanseniaspora uvarum strains are identified in light blue, H. opuntiae strains in green and H. guilliermondii in red.Phenomic characterization of the Hanseniaspora indigenous strains concerning relevant oenological properties.

Hanseniaspora uvarum strains are identified in light blue, H. opuntiae strains in green and H. guilliermondii in red.To obtain the genome sequence of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain, two independent rounds of paired-end MiSeq Illumina-sequencing were used.33 The assembly of the ca. 54 million reads obtained resulted in 208 contigs, yielding a total of 9,037,850 assembled bases (Table 1). This size predicted for the genome of the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain is in line with the genome size described for H. uvarum (ranging between 8.8. and 9.7 Mb34,35) and H. opuntiae (8.8 Mb).34 The predicted GC content of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 is ~31%, also in line with the percentages reported for other Hanseniaspora species (34.7% for H. opuntiae and 31.6% for H. uvarum) and for S. cerevisiae strains (38%). Prior karyotyping of H. guilliermondii wine strains from different geographical origins suggested that that this species is equipped with seven chromosomes, the same number that was attributed to most H. uvarum strains.35,51,52 In line with these results, karyotyping of the UTAD222 strain also revealed seven chromosomal bands (Supplementary Fig. S2). Using this information and also taking advantage of the recently proposed chromosomal map for H. uvarum DSM2768 strain35 and the close similarity between H. guilliermondii, H. opuntiae and H. uvarum species, we have built an organized chromosomal map of the 208 contigs obtained for the UTAD222 strain (Fig. 3 and further information provided in Supplementary Fig. S3). With this approach 192 out of the 208 contigs obtained for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain were assigned to the 7 H. guilliermondii chromosomes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Among the non-assigned contigs was contig 141 (with an approximate size of 12 kb) which is predicted to be the mitochondrial chromosome, based on the high similarity with the mitochondrial sequence described for H. uvarum.53 Comparison with the genomes H. uvarum AWRI3580 and H. opuntiae AWRI3578 proteins evidenced a significant colinearity since in the large majority of the cases orthologues between these species were found to be located contiguously. Despite the large genomic similarity, two relevant genomic alterations were observed in the genome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 corresponding to presumable translocations in chromosomes C, G and F, as detailed in Supplementary Fig. S3. Another aspect that was also rendered clear by our comparative analysis was a higher divergence of the H. uvarum DSM2768 strain, comparing to H. opuntiae AWRI3578, H. guilliermondii UTAD222 and even to H. uvarum AWRI3580 (Supplementary Fig. S3). With the data available, it is not possible to conclude if this divergence corresponds to a different genomic architectures of this strain or if it result from misleading attribution of contigs in the DSM2768 chromosomes since this assignment was very much based on adjusting the size of the chromosomes to the size of the contigs, thereby differing from the herein presented comparative genome analysis.

In yellow, the contig including information predicted to harbour viral DNA is highlighted, while in green, the mitochondrial chromosome is highlighted.Automatic annotation of the genome sequence of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 was firstly performed using ab initio gene detection, afterwards manually curated to refine the results obtained by the informatics analysis. The predicted ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 is estimated in 4,070 protein-encoding genes and 79 tRNAs (Table 1). The incidence of introns is ~1.8%, in line with the low percentages described for other yeast species.54 In specific, 98% (corresponding to 3,998 genes) of the genes were predicted to be intron-free, 69 genes predicted to have two exons and three genes predicted to have three exons. The 4,070 genes that compose the predicted UTAD222 ORFeome were clustered according to their physiological function using MIPS-based Functional Catalogue. As depicted in Fig. 4, the number of H. guilliermondii genes (as well as of H. opuntiae and H. uvarum) included in each functional category was, on an average 70% the number of genes considered for S. cerevisiae, used herein as reference considering the extensive information available on gene functional analysis for this yeast species. This observation along with the fact that many of the H. guilliermondii proteins are similar to more than one S. cerevisiae protein (as detailed in Supplementary Table S5), strongly indicates that H. guilliermondii is a pre-genome duplication species, a trait that has been proposed for this species55 and recently demonstrated for H. uvarum.35Functional clustering of the proteins predicted to be encoded by H. guilliermondii UTAD222. Using the annotated and manually validated H. guilliermondii gene models (Hg), functional clustering was performed using MIPS functional catalogue. For the sake of comparison, a similar analysis was also performed for H. uvarum AWRI3578 (Hu), H. opuntiae AWRI3580 (Ho) and S. cerevisiae S288c (Sc) proteomes. For this, the different sets of proteins predicted to be encoded by the genomes of these three species were imported into Pedant database and then clustered, based on physiological function, using MIPS functional catalogue.Functional clustering of the proteins predicted to be encoded by H. guilliermondii UTAD222.

The results show that the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 strain is equipped with genes encoding enzymes involved in all major pathways of central carbon metabolism including glycolysis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway as well as the anaplerotic enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme (Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably, no genes encoding the key neoglucogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase could be found among H. guilliermondii predicted proteins (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Homologues of these proteins have also not been identified in the predicted proteomes of H. uvarum, H. opuntiae, H. vineae, H. osmophila and H. valbensys (results not shown) suggesting that the absence of a functional neoglucogenesis is a feature of the Hanseniaspora genus. This is a particular interesting trait since robust orthologues for these enzymes are present in members of all the other families that compose the Saccharomycetales order including Saccharomycetaceae, Metschnikowiaceae and Pichiaceae that, like Hanseniaspora, also harbour wine species (results not shown). Consistent with the described ability of H. guilliermondii to use fructose,18,27,56 genes involved in catabolism of this hexose were predicted in the metabolic network of the UTAD222 strain, as well as genes involved in utilization of mannose and starch (Fig. 5). Conversely, genes required for the catabolism of xylose, galactose, lactate, acetate or glycerol were absent from H. guilliermondii genetic repertoire (and also from H. uvarum and H. opuntiae) including isocitrate lyase, galactokinase and glycerol or lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 5). The lack of these genes is consistent with the inability of UTAD222 cells to grow using these carbohydrates as the sole sources of carbon and energy (Supplementary Fig. S6). Although up to now the preferences of Hanseniaspora species concerning carbon sources have essentially focused their ability to consume glucose and/or fructose, it was recently reported the inability of H. uvarum wine isolates to use glycerol as the sole carbon source.50 Overall, the reconstruction of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 complemented with further analysis on the genome of other species having the genome sequenced shows that Hanseniaspora species appear to have a narrow range of carbon sources that can be used among those available in grape-musts, this being a factor that may contribute to reduce their competitiveness in the grape-must environment in which a strong competition for carbon sources is expected to occur. Predicted metabolic network of H. guilliermondii focused on carbon (A) or on nitrogen/sulphur metabolism (B), as suggested by in silico metabolic reconstruction of the gathered genomics data. The gene models predicted for the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 were clustered according with the biochemical pathways they are predicted to be involved in using KEGG reconstruction tool. These results (shown in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4) along with the in silico comparative proteome analyses performed with H. opuntiae, H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae (described below) were used to draw the schematic representation herein presented.Predicted metabolic network of H. guilliermondii focused on carbon (A) or on nitrogen/sulphur metabolism (B), as suggested by in silico metabolic reconstruction of the gathered genomics data.

These results (shown in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4) along with the in silico comparative proteome analyses performed with H. opuntiae, H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae (described below) were used to draw the schematic representation herein presented.Genes encoding enzymes required for the biosynthesis of all proteinogenic amino acids could be predicted from the proteome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222, as well as those genes involved in the incorporation of ammonia to glutamine via a NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase similar to ScGdh2 (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5). Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 is also equipped with a functional transsulfuration pathway for sulphate assimilation, although no genes could be detected for the methionine salvage pathway (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5). This observation is consistent with the lack of genes predicted to be involved in synthesis of polyamines (Supplementary Fig. S5) considering that one of the functions of the methionine salvage pathway is to supply precursors for the synthesis of spermine and spermidine (Fig. 5B). The fact that H. guilliermondii (and also H. opuntiae and H. uvarum) do not encode genes for synthesis of spermidine is interesting considering that this is an essential nutrient for S. cerevisiae growth.57 Spermine and spermidine are among the biogenic amines known to be present in grape-musts and they can also be produced along the alcoholic fermentation,58 which thereby turns possible for Hanseniaspora spp to eventually scavenge these nutrients from the environment rather than prompting their synthesis.Another relevant observation that emerged from the reconstruction of the metabolic network of the UTAD222 strain was the absence of genes involved in biosynthesis of thiamine, pyridoxal, pyridoxine, biotin and for the de novo synthesis of nicotinic acid (Fig. 5B). The absence of these genes is consistent with the previously described auxotrophy of H. guilliermondii for thiamin, niacin, biotin and pyridoxine.59 The inability of Hanseniaspora species to synthesize these vitamins is likely to be a relevant factor in the described low fermentative capacity of these species, particularly in the case of thiamine whose abundance was found to determine the glycolytic flux and, consequently, the fermentation rate of S. cerevisiae cells.60,61 To respond to the depletion of thiamine, S. cerevisiae genes involved in biosynthesis of this vitamin are strongly up-regulated in stationary phase and wine yeast strains were found to evolve adaptive responses to improve the expression of these genes and, consequently, to improve the fermentation rate in grape-musts.61 Consistent with the idea that H. guilliermondii scavenges vitamins from the environment, S. cerevisiae genes involved in synthesis of thiamine (ScTHI20 and ScTHI21), biotin (ScBIO3) or pyridoxine (e.g. ScSNO1), were among those found to be more strongly up-regulated during cultivation in the presence of H. guilliermondii UTAD222.273.3. The ‘transportome’ of H. guilliermondii UTAD222Around 600 genes are predicted to have a transport-related function in H. guilliermondii UTAD222, similar to the number of H. uvarum and H. opuntiae proteins predicted to have this function (Supplementary Table S2). A closer analysis into this ‘transportome’ of H. guilliermondii UTAD222, revealed that it is equipped with 22 predicted sugar transporters, 10 of these being predicted to be hexose transporters (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5). All these putative H. guilliermondii hexose transporters were found to harbour a very high similarity with the high-affinity glucose transporter ScHxt262 or with ScGal2, the galactose permease that has also been shown to transport glucose with a moderate affinity.62 Although H. guilliermondii strains (including UTAD222, Supplementary Fig. S6) are fructophilic56,63,64 there was no orthologue of the fructose specific transporters Ffz1 or Fsy1.65,66 This observation is consistent with results of a previous study that pinpointed the H. guilliermondii NCYC2380 strain as exhibiting fructophilic behaviour but not harbouring Ffz-like genes.56 A large survey for Ffz-like genes in Fungi has also failed to identify robust orthologues for these transporters in the genome of H. uvarum, another reported fructophilic yeast,64,67 as well as in H. vineae and H. valbensyis.68 Interestingly, the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 protein showing a higher similarity with Z. bailii Ffz1 (e-value of the associated alignment of -56, 27% identity) is HGUI01014, predicted to be a polyamine exporter based on its high degree of similarity with the MFS multi-drug resistance transport ScTpo1 (e-value of the associated alignment of -156, 57% identity) (Supplementary Table S2). Further studies are required to better understand what could be the function of predicted hexose transporters in H. guilliermondii and, in specific, if they are somehow able to contribute for the fructophilic behaviour of the species by mediating fructose transport. Phosphorylation of fructose mediated by hexokinases is another critical parameter that was shown to determine the capacity of wine S. cerevisiae strains to use fructose in detriment of glucose.69,70 Thus, it can also be hypothesized that the two hexokinases predicted to be encoded by H. guilliermondii UTAD222 (HGUI_01771, 47% identity with glucokinase ScGlk1 and HGUI_03922, 72% identity) could have a higher affinity for fructose than for glucose. Indeed, preliminary results have shown that Z. bailii encodes a hexokinase having a preference for fructose (over glucose) phosphorylation,71 the hexokinases encoded by H. guilliermondii showing a very high similarity (99% identity at the amino acid level) with those encoded by Z. bailii strains having their genome sequenced (results not shown).Thirty-two H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genes are predicted to encode transporters of nitrogenous compounds (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 5) including permeases for amino acids, ammonium, allantoin, urea and GABA (Fig. 5). Remarkably, 13 of the predicted H. guilliermondii amino acid permeases bear the highest similarity with the general amino acid permeases ScGAP1 and ScAGP1, only being possible to identify specific permeases for lysine and methionine (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 5). Indeed, almost all S. cerevisiae amino acid-specific permeases were found to be absent in H. guilliermondii and also in H. opuntiae and in H. uvarum (Supplementary Table S5 and Table 4). This observation suggests that Hanseniaspora species favor the utilization of permeases with a broader range of substrates in detriment of using specific permeases, which is a reasonable adaptive mechanism since the amount of nitrogen present in wine musts is largely variable and composed by different amino acids.3.3.1. The H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ‘flavorome’It is known that H. guilliermondii affects the production of volatile compounds of wines when in consortium with S. cerevisiae.16–18,27 Other studies have also reported the ability of H. guilliermondii itself to produce compounds having an impact in wine aroma even in single-culture including 2-phenyl ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isobutyric acid, ethyl esters and higher alcohols, albeit in most of these cases the production titers are below those reported for S. cerevisiae.16–19,72 Consistent with these observations, reconstruction of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 metabolic network shows that this strain is equipped with four genes encoding ß-glucosidases, as well as genes required for synthesis of acetaldehyde, ethyl esters and higher alcohols (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S3). Notably, it was not found within the UTAD222 ORFeome proteins similar to the S. cerevisae acetyl transferases involved in synthesis of acetate esters ScATF1, ScATF2 and ScAYT1, although it is known that these are precisely the aroma compounds whose production is more strongly impacted by the presence of H. guilliermondii.17,19,72 Four proteins (HGUI_00697, HGUI_00952, HGUI_01907 and HGUI_01910) harboring motifs conserved within the alcohol acetyltransferase enzyme family were identified in the predicted proteome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222, these proteins only having orthologues in other species of the Hanseniaspora genus (Supplementary Table S3). Further studies are required to confirm if these proteins do represent a novel set of acetyl transferases involved in synthesis of aroma compounds. Another observation of remark was the absence of aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases required for synthesis of higher alcohols from corresponding aldehydes in H. guilliermondii, which could contribute for the reported lower ability of this species to produce these compounds, specially when compared with S. cerevisiae. Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 genes predicted to be involved in formation of aroma compounds. Based on results of metabolic reconstruction and also on orthology with S. cerevisiae genes, the set of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 genes predicted to be involved in pathways leading to the production of aroma compounds was identified. Further details on these genes involved in the ‘flavorome’ of H. guilliermondii are provided in Supplementary Table S4. No genes encoding acetyl transferases involved in synthesis of acetate esters could be predicted in the H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ORFeome and comparative analysis with the proteins having such a function in S. cerevisiae also did not produce results. Nonetheless, four proteins (HGUI_00697, HGUI_00952, HGUI_01907 and HGUI_01910) with motifs found in acetyl transferases were identified in H. guilliermondii suggesting that these could represent a new class of these enzymes.Hanseniaspora guilliermondii UTAD222 genes predicted to be involved in formation of aroma compounds.

Nonetheless, four proteins (HGUI_00697, HGUI_00952, HGUI_01907 and HGUI_01910) with motifs found in acetyl transferases were identified in H. guilliermondii suggesting that these could represent a new class of these enzymes.3.3.2. Comparative analysis of the predicted proteomes of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum and H. opuntiaeTo contribute for a better understanding of the differences and similarities existing among H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum and H. opuntiae, the UTAD222 predicted proteins were compared with those predicted for H. opuntiae AWRI3578 and for H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM2768 strains). This comparative analysis rendered clear a very high similarity between the predicted ORFeomes of these three Hanseniaspora species, more evident for H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table S4). Fourteen H. guilliermondii proteins had no orthologue in H. opuntiae AWRI3578 or H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM2768 strains), these being listed in Table 2. Nine of these proteins had a robust homologue in H. valbyensis indicating that their presence is not specific of the H. guilliermondii species (Table 2). The remaining five proteins could not be identified in the genome of any other species of the Hanseniaspora genus, although homologues could be identified in the genome of other fungal species such as Rhizopus microspores, Zygosaccharomyces bailii or Saitoella complicate (Table 2). These five proteins are all of viral origin including components necessary for the formation of capsid and spike and also a protein required for replication of viral dsDNA (Table 2). The fact that the genes encoding these proteins are contiguous and located in the same genomic region (contig 168) and also the observation that this genomic region exhibits a very strong homology (>95% identity at the nucleotide level) with the genomic sequences of bacteriophages, suggest that H. guilliermondii UTAD222 harbors a viral genome. The existence of viral DNA has been well documented in other wine yeast species including S. cerevisiae, H. uvarum and Z. bailii,73 this being responsible for the killer phenotype that allows cells to secrete toxin(s) to the growth medium that will cause death of sensitive species. In the cases of the three above referred yeast species, the killer phenotype is mediated by non-infectious dsRNA viruses,73 but this phenotype can also be chromosomally encoded or associated with dsDNA plasmids.73 Up to now the ability of H. guilliermondii to induce the killer phenotype has not been studied and the viral genomic sequence herein uncovered does not provide enough information to understand if a toxin can indeed be produced by UTAD222 cells. Nonetheless, this is a topic deserving further investigation considering the role that the killer phenotype has in shaping competitiveness of wine yeast species. Results obtained from the comparative analysis of the predicted H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ORFeome with the set of proteins predicted for H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM7210 strains) or H. opuntiaeIn this table, a selected set of proteins was chosen to illustrate those only found in H. guilliermondii, those found in H. guilliermondii and in H. opuntiae and those found in H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum. A more comprehensive list including all the results is provided in Supplementary Table S5.Results obtained from the comparative analysis of the predicted H. guilliermondii UTAD222 ORFeome with the set of proteins predicted for H. uvarum (AWRI3580 and DSM7210 strains) or H. opuntiaeIn this table, a selected set of proteins was chosen to illustrate those only found in H. guilliermondii, those found in H. guilliermondii and in H. opuntiae and those found in H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum. A more comprehensive list including all the results is provided in Supplementary Table S5.Another aspect of relevance that emerged from the comparative analysis between the H. guilliermondii, H. opuntiae and H. uvarum proteomes was the identification of 26 proteins only shared by H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum and of 87 proteins only shared by H. guilliermondii and H. opuntiae. A full list of these proteins is provided in Supplementary Table S4 and a selected set in Table 2. From the functional point of view, the proteins apparently absent in H. opuntiae include an enzyme predicted to be involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (HGUI_00394), several proteins involved in post-translational modifications (HGUI_03286, HGUI_03882, HGUI_03882, HGUI_03514) and in intracellular protein trafficking (HGUI_03532, HGUI_03531, HGUI_02284) (Supplementary Table S3 and Table 2). Within the data set of proteins apparently absent in H. uvarum, it was possible to identify an homologue of a putative vacuolar membrane copper transporter (HGUI_03602), two proteins involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (HGUI_02076, HGUI_01086) and a putative ß-glucosidase (HGUI_00707). Considering the lack of information concerning the functionality of these proteins, it is hard to link the presence/absence of these proteins with physiological traits of the different Hanseniaspora species, although this is certainly a topic deserving further attention.3.3.3. Comparative analysis of the predicted proteomes of Hanseniaspora spp. and S. cerevisiae: emphasis on genes associated with tolerance to oenological relevant stressesHanseniaspora spp. are known to have multiple phenotypic traits different from those observed in S. cerevisiae wine strains (e.g. different fermentation rates and ability to use terpene-like molecules for the production of aroma compounds)4 and thus, we have hypothesized whether this could result from divergences in the proteomes of the different species. To scrutinize this, the set of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 predicted proteins was compared with those described for the S. cerevisiae wine strain EC1118, widely used for wine-making and having a well annotated genomic sequence.74 The results of this in silico proteomic analysis are detailed in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. Approximately 1,294 H. guilliermondii proteins had no robust homologue in the S. cerevisiae strains examined (listed in Supplementary Table S5). This could occur either because the S. cerevisiae strains do not encode these proteins or because the proteins with a corresponding function are highly divergent from those one found in H. guilliermondii. These H. guilliermondii proteins that had no orthologue in S. cerevisiae were present in H. uvarum and in H. opuntiae (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table S5), suggesting that they comprise specific proteins of the Hanseniaspora genus. The majority of these ‘Hanseniaspora-specific’ proteins (879) have a poorly characterized function but we could identify ß-glucosidases (e.g. HGUI_02084, HGUI_02647 and HGUI_02781), flocculins (e.g. HGUI_01978, HGUI_03264, HGUI_04053, HGUI_01804, HGUI_03963 and HGUI_03989), proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and in translation, as well as proteins involved in respiration and in metabolism of various carbohydrate and nitrogen compounds (Supplementary Table S5). The identification of ß-glucosidase-encoding genes within the set of the putative ‘Hanseniaspora-specific’ genes was expected considering the demonstration of the influence of members of this species, including H. guilliermondii, in increasing the amount of terpenes present in wines;75 a phenotypic trait that is absent in S. cerevisiae strains.76 It was also interesting the emergence in this comparative analysis of several enzymes predicted to be involved in metabolism of tyramine, histamine, histidine or tyrosine (Supplementary Table S5), these being biogenic amines that are known to be present in grape-musts and whose content increases along alcoholic fermentation.58,77 This observation suggests that the presence of H. guilliermondii (and also H. uvarum and H. opuntiae) may play a role in controlling the levels of tyramine and histamine obtained in wines counter-acting, at least in part, the production prompted by S. cerevisiae and other microbiota present in musts.58 Consistent with this idea, previous studies have reported a decrease in the level of biogenic amines produced during the early stages of wine fermentations conducted in the presence of Kloeckera apiculata, the anamorph of H. uvarum, this effect being alleviated as the fermentation proceeds and the abundance of this non-Saccharomyces yeast is reduced.78 This is a particular relevant aspect since the level of tyramine and histamine is a critical parameter determining wine quality and consumers’ health and recommended levels for the amount of these compounds that can be present in wine has been established in a variety of countries.58The comparative analysis performed also led to the identification of about 2,797 S. cerevisiae proteins for which we could not identify an orthologue in the predicted ORFeomes of H. guilliermondii, H. uvarum or H. opuntiae (Supplementary Table S6). This data set of S. cerevisiae proteins absent in Hanseniaspora is enriched in proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, in nitrogen metabolism, in cell cycle, in DNA processing, in RNA synthesis, in transcriptional regulation, in protein synthesis and in intracellular trafficking (Supplementary Table S6). Consistent with the results of the metabolic reconstruction described earlier, among the S. cerevisae genes missing in the Hanseniaspora species were ICL1 encoding isocitrate lyase, PCK1, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FBP1, encoding fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, as well as the genes involved in biosynthesis of thiamine, niacin, biotin or polyamines (Supplementary Table S6). Among the large set of S. cerevisiae proteins involved in transcriptional regulation that were not found in H. guilliermondii were Msn2 and Msn4 transcription factors, essential for control of environmental stress response in the budding yeast79 (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S6). No protein showing similarity to ScMsn2 or ScMsn4 could also be identified in the genome of the other Hanseniaspora species having a genome disclosed indicating that this is a feature of the genus and not specific of the H. guilliermondii species. This observation is intriguing as it leaves open the elucidation of the mechanisms by which Hanseniaspora spp respond to environmental stress, specially taking into account that robust homologues of Msn2 and of its target genes had been identified in the genome of other wine Non-Saccharomyces species such as Z. bailii.80 The existence of a general response to stress showing similarities to the one described in the budding yeast has been characterized in distant fungal species including Lachancea kluyveri, Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe, albeit this transcriptional response was found to be mediated by regulators having little homology with ScMsn2.81–83 Thus, the absence of Msn2/Msn4 orthologues within the Hanseniaspora genus does not per se means that these yeasts will not be equipped with a general stress response. Conservation in the ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 of S. cerevisiae genes identified to be required for tolerance of this species against relevant oenological stresses. Based on results from large-scale phenotypic screenings the S. cerevisiae genes required for tolerance against high concentrations of glucose or ethanol were identified, as well, as the genes required for maximal fermentation in grape-juice medium (also called the ‘fermentome’). The predicted ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 was searched for orthologues of these determinants of stress tolerance being the number of conserved genes identified in each horizontal bar. A selected set of the conserved and non-conserved genes is also shown while the full result is available in Supplementary Table S6. Since Hanseniaspora are highly tolerant to high-glucose concentrations it was not considered of interest to specify the set of non-conserved genes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes mediating multidrug resistance are underlined. *Although Ssu1 was not identified within the set of genes belonging to the fermentome, the absence of this sulphite efflux pump in the Hanseniaspora species is also highlighted in the figure since tolerance to SO2 is generally accepted as a highly relevant trait for oenological strains.Conservation in the ORFeome of H. guilliermondii UTAD222 of S. cerevisiae genes identified to be required for tolerance of this species against relevant oenological stresses.

Similar numbers were also obtained for H. uvarum or H. opuntiae (Supplementary Table S6). Among the genes found to be conserved in the Hanseniaspora species is the protein kinase Hog1 (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S6) as well as most members of the HOG-pathway indicating that this signalling pathway, essential for S. cerevisiae response to stress induced by vinification,89 is conserved in the Hanseniaspora genus. Despite this, we could not identify orthologues within the Hanseniaspora species similar to ScMsn2/ScMsn4, ScHot1 or ScSko1, the known mediators of Hog1-dependent response (Supplementary Table S6). Proteins involved in the assembly and function of the vacuolar ATPase, also identified for S. cerevisae tolerance to vinification-stress, comprised another group of proteins for which we could not identify orthologues in H. guilliermondii (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S7). Among the S. cerevisiae ethanol-resistance genes that had no orthologue in H. guilliermondii are several proteins with peroxisomal function, as well as proteins of the respiratory chain and involved in intracellular protein trafficking (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S7). It remains to be established if the absence of these genes and eventually of others mediating tolerance to ethanol in S. cerevisae contributes for the reduced tolerance of Hanseniaspora species to stressful concentrations of ethanol. An interesting observation that emerged from this comparative analysis was the absence within the three Hanseniaspora species examined of an orthologue for the sulphite efflux pump Ssu1, an essential determinant of S. cerevisiae tolerance to SO2, which is in line with the observed low resilience of these species to SO2-stress in the phenotypic screening shown in Fig. 2 and also reported before.8Overall, the comparative genomic analysis herein performed shows significant differences in the way by which S. cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora spp respond to environmental stress and, in particular, in the response to relevant stresses in the context of wine fermentation with emphasis on the toxicity imposed by high concentrations of ethanol. The release of the genomic sequence of H. guilliermondii as well as the annotation and the comparative analysis herein presented also focusing H. opuntiae and H. uvarum is expected to contribute for a better elucidation of the physiology and biology of these species, essentially by boosting gene and genomic functional analyses. Necessarily, the results of this research will foster the design (or re-design) of Hanseniaspora strains to be used not only in wine-making but also in other relevant biotechnological industrial processes, such as production of aroma compounds, where these species have been identified as potentially interesting cell-factories.90,91This work was financed by FEDER through POCI-COMPETE 2020 and by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (BI/PTDC/AGR-TEC/3315/2014_2016, Project SMARTWINE-‘Smarter win fermentations: integrating omic-tools for development of novel mixed-starter cultures for tailoring wine production’), and supported by FCT to Biosystems and Integrative Sciences Institute (BioISI; FCT/UID/Multi/04046/2013) and to iBB-Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences (through contract UID/BIO/04565/2013).

IntroductionGenomic imprinting results in parent-of-origin expression of genes and controls normal development and maternal behaviour.1–3 Disruption of imprinting leads to developmental defects in humans.4 Imprinting occurs in both groups of therian mammals, the eutherians and marsupials, but there is, as yet, no evidence for imprinting in monotremes.5,6 DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine; 5 mC) is the best known epigenetic mark that plays a critical role in genomic imprinting and regulates retrotransposon activity.7,8 This DNA modification is catalysed by the well characterized DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) family of enzymes including DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT3L.9–11 The DNMT3 family is present in eutherians, marsupials and all non-mammalian vertebrates examined so far.5,12 DNMT3L has no catalytic domain but it is needed to establish DNA methylation.13–15 It is thought to act as a cofactor with other DNMT3 family members to establish DNA methylation and genomic imprinting.16,17Genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation can be observed during both gametogenesis and early embryogenesis in mammals.11 These changes are mediated by a global re-methylation following demethylation known as epigenetic reprogramming. In early embryogenesis, demethylation is necessary for acquisition of totipotency.18–22 Gametogenesis requires global demethylation to ensure the erasure of parent-specific imprinting.7,23 This allows resetting of sex-specific imprinting marks in the male and female germ cells.2,7,23 Most of our understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is based on studies in mice, but much less is known about this in marsupials. In mice there is only a short pre-natal period when germ cells proliferate, but in marsupials there is an extended period of post-natal development. In the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, germ cells continue proliferation for at least 25 days after birth before beginning to enter meiotic and mitotic arrest,24,25 giving an extended window of time in which to examine the relative roles of the somatic environment versus intrinsic germ cell programming in controlling the imprinting. Using a marsupial that diverged from eutherian mammals over 160 Mya to highlight the similarities and dissimilarities in the epigenetic control of germ cell maturation and epigenetic reprogramming can provide new understanding of the evolution and control of mammalian epigenetic processes. As yet, just one gene, H19, has been examined for epigenetic reprogramming of germ cells. This study established that the sequence of events and the relative timing of epigenetic reprogramming of H19 in males is conserved between these mammals.26 However, genome-wide changes in methylation levels in either sex of marsupials are still unknown.In this study, we hypothesized that germ-line methylation is an intrinsic and conserved property of mammalian germ cells and is independent of germ cell migration, proliferation or absolute time of birth. We also hypothesized that the timing of 5 mC emergence and DNMT3L expression coincides with critical stages of germ cell development and maturation and not with the time of birth. To test these hypotheses, we examined the timing of 5 mC emergence in marsupial male and female germ cells and measured the gene expression and localization patterns of DNMT3L in developing tammar gonads of both sexes throughout the duration of their post-natal development in the pouch.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and tissue collectionTammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) originally from Kangaroo Island were collected from our colony at the University of Melbourne. Post-natal samples were collected at appropriate times of postpartum (pp) and were aged based on head length growth curves.27 Pouch young (PY) smaller than 5 g are heterothermic,28 and were cooled on ice then killed by decapitation. PYs over 5 g were anaesthetized with Zoletil (Virbac, Australia) i.m. before killing by decapitation. Gonads were dissected immediately after death and one gonad was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for expression analysis and the other was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH7.4) for immunohistochemistry. All animal experimentation followed the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (2013) guidelines and were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Experimental Ethics Committees. 2.2. Immunofluorescence (IF)Extensive testing of different antibody concentrations and pre-treatments was performed on tammar tissue to optimize each antibody. The DNMT3L antibody chosen (Ab3493, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was based on the BLAST search of amino acid sequence that was specific to DNMT3L. PFA fixed samples were washed in 1×PBS and re-hydrated through an ethanol series before being embedded in paraffin. Embedded samples were serially sectioned at 6 µm on a Rotary Microtome CUT 4060 microtome (microTec Laborgeräte GmbH, Waldorf, Germany) and mounted on poly-lysine coated slides (Thermo Fisher scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Sections were de-waxed, rehydrated through an ethanol-PBS series and then incubated in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 15 min at room temperature to permeabilize the tissue. Sections of testes and ovaries of young aged between day 10 and 70 pp were then treated for 3 min with 4 M HCl, for 10 min at day 100–120 pp and for 20 min at day 200 pp to adult, then washed in PBS and treated for 1.5 min with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin in young aged day 10–25 pp, for 2 min at day 45–70 pp and for 4 min at day 100 pp–adult. Next, the sections were incubated for 1 h with 10% (w/v) horse serum diluted in PBST for blocking. After blocking, sections were incubated with primary antibody solution at 4 °C for 16 h (Table 1). For SOX9 and 5 mC double-staining, we treated sections with 4 M HCl for 10 min after boiling Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) treatment for 20 min. The following day, sections were washed three times with PBST and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 h (Table 1). Sections were washed three times with PBST again and then incubated for 10 min with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). DAPI treated sections were washed with PBST and mounted with DAKO fluorescence mounting solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). The control for all treatments was no primary antibody. These slides were treated in the same manner as described above except primary antibody treatment was omitted. Images were collected on an Olympus DP70 Microscope Digital Camera System (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies used for this studyAntibodies used for this study2.3. Quantitation of 5 mC stainingGenome-wide changes in DNA methylation levels were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF) using a DNA methylation specific antibody to 5-methylcytosine (5 mC). We also performed H&E staining using the same samples to distinguish germ cells from somatic cells on the basis of their distinctive morphology as described previously.25,29–31 Intensity of fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The intensity of 5 mC staining in germ cells was normalized to that of somatic cells in adjacent areas of the section: Sertoli cells in males and pre-granulosa/granulosa cells in females. Differences in levels of 5 mC between stages were analysed by Tukey–Kramer’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test after analysis of variance (ANOVA) with R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).2.4. Gonadal RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisSnap-frozen gonads were used for RNA extraction using the GenElute Mammalian total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was treated with the DNA free DNase treatment and removal kit (Thermo Fisher scientific, Massachusetts, USA) to remove residual genomic DNA and then used as a template for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III First strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).2.5. Sequencing of cDNA encoding the partial tammar DNMT3LA BLAST search of the new tammar genome database (Wallabase 4.0 O’Neill, Fujiyama, Heider, Renfree, Pask et al. personal communication) was performed using the mouse Dnmt3l sequence and then a putative DNMT3L gene was identified. Tammar DNMT3L specific primers were made on the basis of the putative sequence (Table 2). PCR reactions were performed using GoTaq Green master mix (Promega Corporation, USA). PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and directly sequenced (Micromon Sequencing Facility, Monash University, Clayton) using the PCR primers. Primers used for this studyPrimers used for this study2.6. Bioinformatics analysisDNA sequences of various mammalian DNMT3s (koala, grey short-tailed opossum, Tasmanian devil, mouse and human) and human DNMT2 were obtained by BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Amino acid sequences retrieved from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank/RefSeq database were used to generate a phylogenetic tree. The alignment of the translated sequences was performed by Muscle with MEGA7 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Genetic distances were calculated using the Poisson model. A phylogenetic tree of the DNMT3 family members was produced with MEGA7 using the Neighbour joining method. Accession numbers were: Phascolarctos cinereus predicted DNMT3L, RefSeq Accession XM_020995934.1; Monodelphis domestica predicted DNMT3L, RefSeq Accession XM_007493298.2; Sarcophilus harrisii predicted DNMT3L, RefSeq Accession XM_012544408.2; Mus musculus Dnmt3a, AF068625; M. musculus Dnmt3b, BC083147; M. musculus Dnmt3l, BC083147; Homo sapiens DNMT3A, AF331856; H. sapiens DNMT3B, AF176228; H. sapiens DNMT3L, BC002560 and H. sapiens DNMT2, AF045888.2.7. Reverse-transcription quantitative RT-PCRReverse-transcription quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) primers (Table 2) were designed from the known tammar partial sequence and amplified a 133 base pairs product. RT-qPCR was performed on a MX3000P (STRATAGENE, California, USA) on gonadal cDNA of both sexes from day 10 pp to adult using the SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were selected as the housekeeping genes. The DNMT3L gene expression levels were normalized to the geometric mean of the expression levels of housekeeping genes. Differences in the gene expression levels between stages were analysed by Tukey–Kramer’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test after ANOVA in R as described above.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation during spermatogenesisMale germ cells in developing testes migrated from the centre to the periphery of tubules, while Sertoli cells were always located around the periphery of tubules. In H&E and DAPI staining, nuclei of Sertoli cells had a more intense and darker staining than that of germ cells. The nuclei of germ cells were large and ovoid. The nuclei of Sertoli cells were positive for 5 mC at all developmental stages. At day 10 postpartum (pp), the intensity of 5 mC staining in germ cells was almost identical with Sertoli cells (Fig. 1A). At day 25 pp, the intensity of 5 mC in germ cells decreased so that some of germ cells were negative for 5 mC (Fig. 1B). At day 50 pp, all germ cells were stained and the intensity of 5 mC in the germ cells had increased (Fig. 1C). By day 70 pp, germ cell staining was similar to that seen at day 50 pp (Fig. 1D). From day 100 pp onwards, approx. 54% of germ cells were intensely stained (Fig. 1E). The average number of intensely stained germ cells increased by 34% at around day 200 pp (Fig. 1F).

Genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation during oogenesisFemale germ cells had large and ovoid nuclei. From day 10 pp to day 50 pp, germ cells formed germ cell nests. Somatic cell nuclei stained darker with both H&E and DAPI. DNA methylation of developing ovaries were also tested by IF with the 5 mC specific antibody. Around day 10 pp, nuclei of oogonia were more intensely stained by 5 mC antibody than those of pre-granulosa cells (Fig. 2A). From day 25 pp to day 50 pp, intensities of 5 mC staining in germ cells were similar to each other (Fig. 2B and C). At day 70 pp, several primordial follicles were observed and nuclei of oogonia were still intensely stained at this stage (Fig. 2D). Around day 120 pp, intensities of 5 mC staining in germ cells were weaker than in pre-granulosa and granulosa cells (Fig. 2E). At this stage, there was a larger number of primary follicles. Around day 200 pp, nuclei of oocytes were intensely stained by 5 mC antibody (Fig. 2F). The intensity of 5 mC in oocyte nuclei increased between day 120 and day 200 pp, and granulosa cells were also stained. In adults, there were some secondary follicles and tertiary follicles and 5 mC staining in germ cells was intense (Fig. 2G and H). 5mC localization during oogenesis.

Quantitation of DNA methylation levels during gametogenesisRegardless of sex, levels of 5 mC in late-stage germ cells were relatively high. In males during testicular differentiation, 5 mC in germ cells significantly decreased between day 10 pp and day 25 pp (P < 0.05) and then gradually increased to day 200 pp (Fig. 3A). In females during ovarian differentiation, levels of 5 mC in germ cells were constant until day 25 pp and then slowly demethylated. At that time, levels of 5 mC in somatic cells decreased slightly and there was no significant difference between stages (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although there was no significant difference in levels of 5 mC in germ cells between day 10 pp and day 70 pp, there was significant demethylation (P < 0.05) by linear regression analysis based on the ages of the individual PYs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The speed of demethylation was effectively increased in female germ cells after day 70 pp. Levels of 5mC significantly decreased between day 70 pp and day 120 (P < 0.05). Compared with day 25 pp, methylation levels in germ cells had decreased by ~36% between day 70 pp and day 120 pp. Based on the two different demethylation rates, we divided DNA demethylation into two phases, I and II. After day 120 pp when oogenesis and follicular formation was beginning, levels of 5 mC in germ cells then increased by day 200 pp (Fig. 3B). At these stages, levels of 5 mC in somatic cells were almost identical (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Quantitation of 5mC during gametogenesis.

Isolation and sequencing of the partial tammar DNMT3LOverall 1245 bp of full tammar DNMT3L candidate sequence was identified from BLAST. The tammar DNMT3L appears to be highly conserved with that of other mammals. Although we could not amplify the full coding sequence of the predicted tammar DNMT3L, a partial sequence was obtained by PCR with DNMT3L primers described in Table 2. The partial nucleotide sequence was identical with our predicted tammar DNMT3L, and the amino acid sequence included partial ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain. The amino acid sequence of predicted full tammar DNMT3L was generated (Supplementary Fig. S3), and it was 60% identical with Homo sapiens DNMT3L. Tammar DNMT3L lacks the consensus residues which are necessary for the formation of the catalytic centre of cytosine methyltransferases, similar to mouse Dnmt3l. Amino acid sequences were aligned against several DNMT3s including both human and mouse DNMT3 family members to produce a phylogenetic tree of the family members (Fig. 4). All the marsupial DNMT3Ls clustered into one branch, clearly distinct from the eutherian species such as mouse and human. Within the marsupials, the South American didelphid Monodelphis grouped with the Australian dasyurid Sarcophilus. The dasyurids are thought to be close to the ancestral Australian marsupials, from which the diprotodont species (tammar and koala, Phascolarctos) derived. The tammar DNMT3L clustered together with that of another marsupial, the koala, Phascolarctos cinereus predicted DNMT3L. DNMT3A, DNMT3B and DNMT2 all occupy separate branches of this tree.

Gene expression patterns of tammar DNMT3L during gametogenesisDuring tammar testicular differentiation, DNMT3L gene expression was significantly up-regulated at day 40 pp (P < 0.05) and gradually down-regulated from 40 pp to adult. In adults, DNMT3L expression was low (Fig. 5A). In contrast, during ovarian differentiation DNMT3L gene expression was gradually up-regulated from day 25 pp to day 120 pp and then rapidly up-regulated from day 120 pp to adult (Fig. 5B).

Immunolocalization of tammar DNMT3LA single band was detected between 37 kDa and 50 kDa of molecular weight marker in western blotting. Thus, the predicted size of full length tammar DNMT3L is approx. 45 kDa, similar to eutherian DNMT3L. During male testicular differentiation, DNMT3L was predominantly cytoplasmic in male germ cells (Fig. 6A–D). By day 200 pp, weak DNMT3L staining was detected in the nuclei of germ cells (Fig. 6E). Interestingly, DNMT3L localized in the nuclei of germ cells and heads of spermatozoa in the adult testis (Fig. 6F). Nuclei of female germ cells stained more intensively than those of males. In the early stages, up to day 50 pp, DNMT3L was predominantly cytoplasmic in female germ cells and nuclear staining was detected in a few germ cells (Fig. 7A and B). By day 70 pp, DNMT3L staining was now predominant in the nuclei of germ cells (Fig. 7C). From day around 100 pp, DNMT3L staining in the nuclei was quite intense (Fig. 7D–F).

DiscussionGlobal DNA methylation levels in the developing germ cells in the developing tammar changed dynamically during the extended period of gametogenesis in this marsupial. In addition, the timing of methylation events differed between males and females. This correlated with sex-specific patterns for both mRNA expression and protein localization of the key DNA-methyltransferase DNMT3L. This is the first study to report the expression patterns of the DNMT3L gene in the developing gonads of any marsupial and suggests that DNA methylation-reprogramming in tammar is mediated by processes that have been highly conserved for at least 160 million years. The phylogenetic tree also suggests that the marsupial and eutherian genes had a common ancestor at the time of divergence of the therian mammals.In the tammar, most primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate to the gonadal ridge just before birth.25 Female germ cells do not begin to enter meiosis until 25 days postpartum (pp) and all have not entered meiotic arrest until around day 70 pp. Similarly, male germ cells do not enter mitotic arrest until 25 days pp and this process is also not complete until after day 70 pp.25,32 At day 10 and day 25 pp, 5 mC expression levels were similar in female germ cells, but it rapidly decreased in male germ cells between day 10 and day 25 pp. Rapid PGC proliferation occurs in both sexes at this stage24 so it is possible that DNA replication-dependent passive demethylation was operative at this time in males but not in females. During mouse spermatogenesis, genome-wide demethylation occurs during PGC migration and is complete before mitotic arrest.33 Tammar male germ cells also showed genome-wide demethylation before mitotic arrest, indicating that the relative timing of demethylation during spermatogenesis is conserved between the mouse and tammar. DNA methylation levels in male germ cells rapidly increased from day 25 pp to day 200 pp. Male germ cells enter mitotic arrest from day 25 pp.32 During mouse spermatogenesis, DNA re-methylation begins during mitotic arrest,33 similar to the tammar. Before oocyte growth, mouse female germ cells have very low levels of DNA methylation.34 In the female tammar, rapid loss of DNA methylation was detected between day 70 pp and day 120 pp, before oocyte growth and ovarian maturation, when the methylation level was significantly lower than other stages. Thereafter, DNA methylation levels rapidly increased between day 120 pp and day 200 pp. During tammar oogenesis, rapid oocyte growth and follicle expansion begins around day 120 and continues to day 250 pp.35 In mice, re-establishing DNA methylation also occurs during oocyte growth.34,36 Thus, the relative timing of completion of demethylation and initiation of re-methylation during oogenesis is also conserved between the tammar and mouse, but the duration is greatly extended in the tammar. The genome-wide changes in DNA methylation occurs during post-natal stages of tammar, while it occurs during the very short prenatal stages of mouse, but the patterns and relative timing of demethylation and re-methylation are identical as described above.During mouse gametogenesis, demethylation of the H19 imprinted gene locus is mediated by both active and passive mechanisms and active demethylation is necessary for the completion of imprint erasure.37 Due to the rapid development of mice, the genome-wide demethylation process is complete within a few days, making it difficult to observe the active and passive mechanisms separately. In contrast, the timing of demethylation in female germ cells is extended in the tammar. A significant but small linear decrease in 5 mC was detected between day 25 pp and day 70 pp in the female tammar. At that time, somatic 5 mC levels also decreased slightly, but there was no significant difference between the developmental stages. This data coincided with previous reports about DNA methylation of gonadal somatic cells in developing ovaries in mouse and human.38,39 Between day 70 pp and day 120 pp, when almost all germ cells have entered meiotic arrest, there was a significant demethylation. The two different demethylations observed before and after day 70 pp suggest that demethylation in female tammar germ cells occurs in two phases, I and II. The first demethylation phase occurred during germ cell proliferation and onset of meiosis when this process may be mediated by DNA replication-dependent passive demethylation. The second demethylation phase occurred after the germ cells were in meiotic arrest and before oogenesis, suggesting this process may be mediated by DNA replication-independent active demethylation mechanisms. In mice, there is an enzyme-linked active demethylation mechanism during gametogenesis,40–42 and the putative poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway may act as a candidate mechanism through transcriptional regulation and/or histone modification.37,43 We hypothesize that two demethylation phases in tammar reflects a passive phase followed by an active phase, possibly controlled by a PARP pathway.Mouse Dnmt3l is clearly involved in the re-establishment of DNA methylation patterns in the germ cells.13,15,44 However, expression patterns of other DNMT3 family members such as Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are not correlated with methylation dynamics or germline development in mice45 so it is difficult to compare the relative timing between mouse and tammar based on developmental events. Thus, from expression studies observed here, it is likely that tammar DNMT3L also has a critical role for re-establishing DNA methylation. During spermatogenesis, tammar DNMT3L was highly expressed around day 40 pp, at which time a global re-methylation occurred in male germ cells and then expression levels were gradually decreased. Similarly, mouse and rat Dnmt3l is up-regulated at the time of re-methylation and then expression levels are gradually decreased during spermatogenesis.44,46 In contrast, during tammar oogenesis, both genome-wide DNA re-methylation and up-regulation of tammar DNMT3L expression in female germ cells coincided with the time of rapid oocyte growth that occurs from day 12035 in a similar way to that in the mouse.47 In the mouse, these sex-specific expression patterns are regulated by sex-specific promoters.48 Since the expression pattern of tammar DNMT3L was similar to that of the mouse, it is likely that sex-specific promoters may be conserved between the mouse and tammar. Analysis of promoter regions of tammar DNMT3L would be interesting to discover whether the regulatory mechanisms have also been conserved though mouse Dnmt3l has some sex-specific isoforms.48Several studies report that mouse Dnmt3l localizes in the nuclei of germ cells in the perinatal testes,49,50 but tammar DNMT3L was detected predominantly as a cytoplasmic protein until the later stages of pouch life in the tammar developing testis, consistent with the greatly extended duration of post-natal development compared to that of the mouse. DNMT3L was also strongly localized in the heads of spermatozoa in the adult. During early ovarian differentiation, DNMT3L protein was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of germ cells and its nuclear localization was detected only in a few germ cells up to day 50 pp. After day 50 pp, DNMT3L became predominantly localized in the nuclei of female germ cells. During mouse oogenesis, Dnmt3l is essential for the establishment of maternal imprints and acts as an accessary protein of Dnmt3a to recruit target gene loci15,16 presumably from a nuclear location. The gene expression patterns of tammar DNMT3L corresponded to the time of re-methylation during oogenesis, and significantly the protein in germ cells was strongly nuclear at the time of re-methylation. These results suggest that tammar DNMT3L may act in the establishment of maternal imprints during oogenesis as in other mammals.Although the expression patterns of tammar DNMT3L in male germ cells corresponded with the timing of re-methylation, tammar DNMT3L was predominantly cytoplasmic in male germ cells. This raises the possibility that not only tammar DNMT3L but also other molecular machineries are necessary for re-establishing methylation in developing testes. Although mouse Dnmt3l is required for the establishment of normal paternal methylation imprints during spermatogenesis, there is some methylation present in Dnmt3l deficient male germ cells but not in female germ cells.51 Therefore, a DNMT3L-independent methylation pathway may exist in male germ cells during spermatogenesis. The present results support the idea that the DNMT3L-independent mechanism may act in re-methylation processes during spermatogenesis. Interestingly, DNMT3L changed its localization and became nuclear in adult germ cells, suggesting it might regulate methylation in later stages of spermatogenesis. Dnmt3l deficient male mice have meiotic ‘catastrophes’ during which there is reactivation of retrotransposons in the male germ cells.13 In addition, mouse Dnmt3l establishes DNA methylation not only at paternally imprinted gene loci but also at non-pericentric heterochromatic sequences and interspersed repeats, and it affects chromatic compaction in later stage testes.51 In Dnmt3l deficient adult mice, there is a loss of chromatin compaction which leads to apoptosis.51,52 Since Dnmt3l transcripts are almost absent in adults, it was assumed that there is no Dnmt3l protein in adults.13 Although the expression levels of tammar DNMT3L were very low, similar to that of mouse Dnmt3l, tammar DNMT3L was detected in the nuclei of germ cells in adults. Therefore, it is possible that tammar DNMT3L has an un-documented function which may be required for the chromatin condensation in differentiating male germ cells.Our findings clearly show that the basic mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming must have been established before the marsupial-eutherian split over 160 Mya and open new perspectives for identifying a novel active demethylation mechanism in female germ-line. In addition to these, our data point towards a major role of a key enzyme, DNMT3L, in the process of epigenetic reprogramming and gametogenesis with respect to its protein localization. Since epigenetic reprogramming in the tammar occurs over such an extended period of time and whilst the young are accessible in the mother’s pouch, further study of the marsupial will allow for more precise manipulation of the processes to elucidate the mechanisms of control.The authors thank Chris Lucas for assistance with the animals, all members of the wallaby research group for help with the animals and the dissections, and Dr. Stephen Frankenberg for assistance with the analysis of the tammar DNMT3L sequence.FundingThis study was supported by funds from the Norma Hilda Schuster (nee Swift) Scholarship from the University of Melbourne to T.I. and the School of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAspergillus flavus is a major plant pathogen that is widely distributed throughout the world. This organism is the causative agent of aspergillosis, an important zoonotic mycosis. Worldwide, A. flavus is the second leading cause of invasive and non-invasive aspergillosis.1,2 Tashiro et al. reported that about ~5% of respiratory positive Aspergillus spp. cultures in Japan are identified as A. flavus.3 However, clinical A. flavus isolates have not been sufficiently investigated, and its virulence factors remain largely unknown.Aspergillus flavus is also a well-known aflatoxin producer. Aflatoxins have serious hepatotoxic, hepatocarcinogenic, and immunosuppressive effects on humans and animals.4,5 Aflatoxigenic A. flavus is not prevalent in the environment in Japan,6 and as such, aflatoxin production in Japanese clinical A. flavus isolates has not been investigated and the genome characteristics and pathogenicity of these strains are unknown. The present study aims to determine the genome sequences and phenotypes, including pathogenicity, of A. flavus strains clinically isolated in Japan.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and preparation of conidiaThe ten strains of A. flavus used in this study (Table 1) were obtained from the Medical Mycology Research Center (MMRC), Chiba University, through the National BioResource Project (http://www.nbrp.jp (15 November 2018, date last accessed)). rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequence (ITS) or partial ß-tubulin (benA) sequence of A. flavus IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60519, IFM60655, IFM61224, and IFM61226 were analyzsed to identify as A. flavus in MMRC. Other strains might be identified as A. flavus based on the morphology. Genome sequence data for A. flavus strains NRRL33577 and Aspergillus oryzae RIB408 were used in this study. These strains were routinely cultured at 25°C for 2 weeks on potato dextrose agar, followed by conidia collection as described previously.9 We observed very little A. flavus IFM59975, IFM61224, or IFM61226 conidia formation. Recovered conidia were used in further experiments. Source of strains investigated in this studySource of strains investigated in this study2.2. Whole-genome sequencingA ZR Fungal/Bacterial DNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) was used to prepare genomic DNA from A. flavus and A. oryzae strains. Five micrograms of genomic DNA were broken into fragments of, on average, 500 bp using a Covaris S2 sonication system (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were prepared using a NEBNext DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). A total of 300 cycles of paired-end sequencing were carried out using a MiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The sequencing reads were trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench ver. 6.5 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the following parameters: Phred quality score > 30; remove 15 terminal nucleotides from the 5’ end and 2 terminal nucleotides from the 3’ end; remove truncated reads less than <100 nucleotides in length. Trimmed reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench ver. 6.5 (Qiagen). Accession numbers in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive and the scaffold accession number are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Assembled scaffolds were mapped to the genome data of A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40 using MUMmer. Trimmed read data sets by ea-utils10 were mapped to the assembled scaffolds or reference genomes using Bowtie2 v.2.3.211 with ‘–very-sensitive’ option. The number of reads is shown in Supplementary Table S2. Scaffold data were analysed using b-MiGAP12; assembled scaffold numbers, total read lengths, and the number of CDS regions are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. For genome-wide phylogenetic analysis, trimmed reads including SRR1835311 as the short read of A. oryzae RIB40 were mapped to the reference genome of A. flavus NRRL3357 using Bowtie2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using samtools v. 1.813, and filtered with 10-fold coverage, 30 mapping quality, and 75% consensus using in-house scripts.14,15. Repetitive regions of A. flavus NRRL3357 identified by RepeatMasker v. open-4.0.7 (http://repeatmasker.org (15 November 2018, date last accessed)) were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. A maximum likelihood tree of 12 strains including A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40 was constructed based on 268, 510 SNPs using RAxML v. 8.2.1116 with 1, 000 bootstrap, and visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (11 July 2017, date last accessed)).2.3. Partial sequencing of a-amylase geneA partial a-amylase gene, including mismatches between the original copy and extra copies in A. oryzae, was amplified with a forward primer (5'-CTAACCATCACATAGTTGGACTATATCCAG-3'), a reverse primer (5'-GTCGGTCGGGTAGCCCGAGAGCCAGGTTGC-3'), and EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Amplified fragments were purified with FastGene Gel and a PCR Extraction Kit (NIPPON Genetics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and sequenced using a BigDye terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Prediction of gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesisSecondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster sequences were predicted using antiSMASH (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/ (21 April 2017, date last accessed)) from annotated data for non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS), PKS, dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase(DMTS), and terpene synthase. A total of 87 clusters were found (Supplementary Table S3). In 34 of the 87 clusters in A. oryzae RIB40, almost the entirety of each region was covered with reads obtained from each strain.2.5. Detection of aflatoxinTo prepare A. flavus and A. oryzae extracts, conidia were inoculated on sterilized maize grain and cultured for 4–5 days at 25°C. After cultivation, each grain covered with fungal cells was dipped into 1 ml 70% wt/vol, methanol, and secondary metabolites, including aflatoxins, were extracted by mixing vigorously. The supernatants obtained from each strain were used in the following analyses. Extract aflatoxin content was estimated using a MycoJudge Total Aflatoxin ELISA kit (NH Foods Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and detected by liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF) as described below. Samples were separated by LC using the Agilent 1260 infinity system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column (Agilent Technologies) maintained at 40°C. Ammonium acetate (5 mM) (A) and methanol (B) were used as mobile phases. Each 3 µLµl sample was separated with LC, using a gradient of 10% A/90% B to 100% B over 30 min with a flow rate of 0.2 mLml/min. The Agilent 6550 iFunnel QTOF LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies) was used for MS analysis.2.6. Detection of ustiloxin B by LC-MS/MSThe procedures used to prepare extracts and detect ustiloxin B produced by each strain are the same as those used for aflatoxin detection, as described above. Because we could not obtain a standard sample of ustiloxin B, we used an estimation based on the measured accurate mass of the protonated molecular ion [M + +H]+ that indicated relative mass errors within ± 2 ppm and high isotope scores (> 85%).2.7. Visualization of sequence dataSequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA7.17 The Integrative Genomic Viewer18, 19 (Broad Institute) was used to search the mapped reads and scaffolds of reference genomes. J-Circos (Australian Prostate Cancer Research Centre)20 was used to visualize the mapped reads for each strain. The Artemis Comparison Tool (Sanger Institute) was used for visualization by synteny plot.213. Results and discussion3.1. Mapping of A. flavus data on the reference genomes of A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40The read data from each clinical isolate of A. flavus were mapped to A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357 reference genome data and scaffolds of ten  A. flavus strains. Mapping rates are shown in Table 2. Mapped reads on A. oryzae RIB40 chromosomes were visualized with J-Circos,20 as shown in Fig. 1. Some large gaps were found compared with A. oryzae RIB40. Additional notes about large gaps are included in the Supplementary Text. Mapping of reads to scaffold and reference genomeaThe sequence reads of the isolates were mapped onto their scaffolds as well as onto the genome sequence of RIB40, and the percentages of successful mapping are shown. The highest mapping (black cells) and the second highest mapping (grey cells) are indicated.Mapping of reads to scaffold and reference genomeaThe sequence reads of the isolates were mapped onto their scaffolds as well as onto the genome sequence of RIB40, and the percentages of successful mapping are shown.

Solid circles indicate putative centromeres and centripetal solid lines on the outermost grey circle indicate chromosome boundaries.Phylogenic analysis was performed based on identified 268, 510 SNPs, which indicated ten strains used in this study were roughly divided into three groups (Fig. 2). Aspergillus flavus NRRL3357 was grouped in a same group with A. flavus IFM55053, IFM58503, and IFM61226 (Fig. 2, shaded with green). On the other hand, A. oryzae RIB40 was grouped in a same group with A. flavus IFM54693, IFM59894, IFM59975, IFM60655, and IFM61224 (Fig. 2, shaded with blue). Aspergillus flavus IFM57535 and IFM60519 were away from both groups.An unrooted phylogenetic tree of ten clinical isolates of A. flavus, along with A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40, calculated on the basis of SNPs identified. The light gray-shaded strains include A. flavus NRRL3357, while the gray-shaded ones include A. oryzae RIB40.An unrooted phylogenetic tree of ten clinical isolates of A. flavus, along with A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40, calculated on the basis of SNPs identified. The light gray-shaded strains include A. flavus NRRL3357, while the gray-shaded ones include A. oryzae RIB40.More unmapped reads were observed in A. flavus IFM54693 than in the other strains (Table 2). One possible reason for this is that the total scaffold length of A. flavus IFM54693 was shortest of all ten strains and ~1.5 Mb shorter than the average of the other nine strains. A possible cause of short total scaffold length is that scaffolds smaller than 1 kb were not included in this analysis. The impaired region, therefore, might be a cause of reads unmapped to the strain’s own scaffold and to those of other strains. Additionally, many unmapped reads were across two different scaffolds (data not shown). Consistent with this finding, most unmapped reads were mapped on strains’ own scaffolds using the ‘local’ option in Bowtie2 (which improved the mapping rate from 74.90% to 96.16%), suggesting that A. flavus IFM54693 has some rearrangement regions, which could be a cause of the low mapping rate. Further investigation using long-read sequence technologies is warranted to determine the precise reason for many unmapped A. flavus IFM54693 reads.3.2. Comparison of strains by molecular phylogenetic analysis of cmdAPartial gene sequences of ß-tubulin (benA), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2), and a calmodulin gene (cmdA) similar to the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1–5.8S-ITS2 region) have been used as molecular identification markers to distinguish species, and the calmodulin gene has been proposed as a secondary identification marker.22 The partial benA and rpb2 genes of the ten  A. flavus strains used in this study were identical or had single base substitutions compared with the sequences of A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40. The partial cmdA sequences were more diverse than those of benA or rpb2 among the ten strains. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the ten strains could be divided into three groups (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the findings of Okoth et al.23Molecular phylogenic analysis of partial cmdA sequences by the maximum likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model.37 The tree with the highest log likelihood (-817.8602) is shown. The number at each of the branch points indicates percentage of association of the clustered sequences listed. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying neighbour-joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood approach and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete <U+03B3> distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites [5 categories (+G, parameter = 0.0500)]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths based on the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 20 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 516 positions in the final data set.

Two clinical isolates possess one or two extra copies of the a-amylase geneAspergillus oryzae RIB40 possesses one original a-amylase gene and two extra identical a-amylase gene copies.8 On the other hand, A. flavus NRRL3357 has only an original a-amylase gene. Three nucleotide mismatches have been identified between the original a-amylase gene and the two extra a-amylase copies.24 To detect the extra a-amylase copies, we performed sequencing a partial region of a-amylase genes. As shown in Fig. 4, the 791st nucleotide residue of A. flavus NRRL3357, indicating that the strain did not contain extra a-amylase copies (Fig. 4, top). No clinical isolates, except A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655, included these mismatches, suggesting that they do not possess the extra a-amylase copies found in the A. oryzae RIB40 strain. On the other hand, A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655 showed thymine and cytosine peaks at the 791st nucleotide residue in the a-amylase gene (Fig. 4). As consistent with that, we found reads possessing thymine or cytosine at the residue of both strains. The peak heights of the thymine and cytosine nucleotides of A. flavus IFM60655 were similar each other, suggesting that an extra a-amylase gene was presence in the genome of A. flavus IFM60655 similarly to A. oryzae NBRC30105.24 On the other hand, the thymine peak was higher than the cytosine peak at the same site in A. flavus IFM54693 similar to A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 4), suggesting that A. flavus IFM54693 has two extra a-amylase copies. As shown in Fig. 2, A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655 are phylogenetically close to A. oryzae RIB40, suggesting that these strains might be classified as A. oryzae. Although A. flavus IFM59975 is also included in a group with A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655, the strain did not possess extra a-amylase gene, suggesting that A. flavus IFM59975 is closer to native strain in Japan than the other extra-a-amylase acquired strains or lose extra a-amylase genes spontaneously.Sanger sequencing revealed a difference between the original and a secondary a-amylase gene.Sanger sequencing revealed a difference between the original and a secondary a-amylase gene.3.4. Most clinical isolates possess the RIB40-type aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusterThe clusters homologous to the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster in ten clinical isolates were compared with those of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357. As shown in Fig. 5, the region from fas-1 to norB could clearly be divided into three groups: A. flavus NRRL3357-type, A. oryzae RIB40-type, or another group including A. flavus IFM59894 and IFM60655. The clusters from hypA to norB in A. flavus IFM57535 and IFM60519 are nearly identical to those in A. oryzae RIB40. Those strains were separated from each other in the phylogenetic (Fig. 2). The clusters in A. flavus IFM54693, IFM59975, and IFM61224 are highly similar to those in A. oryzae RIB40 in the region from avnA to norB, and these strains were included in a group with A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the A. flavus IFM61226 cluster from hypA to norB is highly similar to that of A. flavus NRRL3357. The A. flavus IFM58503 cluster and the A. flavus IFM55053 show high identity from ver-1 to norB and hypA to aflR in the A. flavus NRRL3357 aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster, respectively. As shown in phylogenetic analysis based on SNPs, those A. flavus strains, IFM55053, IFM58503, and IFM61226 were included in a group with A. flavus NRRL3357 (Fig. 2). The clusters in IFM55053, IFM59894, and IFM60655 are partially deleted (Fig. 5).Comparison of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters.

Dotted lines corresponding to the region containing cypA and norB indicate a 612-base deletion including the start codons for cypA and norB.As shown by Tominaga et al.25 and Kiyota et al.,26 some of the genes that differ between A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357 play roles in aflatoxin production. In A. oryzae RIB40, AflT has a large deletion of the C-terminal region due to a TC nucleotide insertion. All of the A. flavus strains, except IFM58503 and IFM61226, also have the AflT C-terminal deletion, as does A. oryzae RIB40. In norA of A. oryzae RIB40, a frameshift mutation was reported to be the cause of truncation.25 Among A. flavus clinical strains, this frameshift mutation was not found. The intergenic region and 5’-coding sequences of cypA and norB, which are deleted in A. oryzae strains, including RIB40 and several A. flavus strains,25,27 are retained in A. flavus IFM58503, IFM61226, and NRRL3357. AflJ is an aflatoxin pathway regulator that binds to another regulator, AflR,28 to cooperatively regulate genes in the aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster.26,29 Kiyota et al. reported that AflJ in A. oryzae had four unique amino acid substitutions as compared with A. flavus strains, indicating that these substitutions induce inactivation of AflJ.26 As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, A. flavus IFM54693, IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60519, and IFM61224 share four amino acids with A. oryzae RIB40 at the 8th, 22nd, 268th, and 354th nucleotide residues of AflJ, suggesting that AflJ is inactivated in those strains.Production of aflatoxin or its intermediates were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mass spectrometry. Consistent with grouping with the region from fas-1 to norB, aflatoxins were not detected in the extracts from the strains with an RIB40-type cluster (Fig. 5). In A. flavus IFM58503 extracts, two aflatoxin intermediates, sterigmatocystin and O-methylsterigmatocystin (OMST), were detected by mass spectrometry (data not shown). OMST is converted into aflatoxin B1 and G1 by OrdA. OrdA of A. flavus IFM58503 has an A110E substitution, which is conserved among A. flavus NRRL3357, A. oryzae RIB40, and nine other isolates. Because the amino acid is also conserved among OrdA homologues in Aspergillus ochraceoroseus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus nomius, the mutation might contribute to the non-aflatoxigenicity of the strain. Aflatoxin B1 was detected in A. flavus IFM61226 extracts by mass spectrometry but not by ELISA (data not shown). The aflatoxin production of A. flavus IFM61226 was significantly lower than that of A. flavus NRRL3357, suggesting that some factors inside or outside of the A. flavus IFM61226 cluster affect production.Aflatoxin production was not detected in the studied strains, except in A. flavus IFM61226. This result reflects the prevalence of non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus in the environment in Japan. Aspergillus flavus IFM61226 possesses an aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster sequence highly similar to that of A. flavus NRRL3357. Aspergillus flavus IFM55053, IFM59894, and IFM60655 have lost a part of this cluster, as shown in Fig. 5. Although A. flavus IFM54693, IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60519, and IFM61224 possess the entire cluster region, aflatoxin production was impaired in these strains. The clusters in these strains show high identity with A. oryzae RIB40 suggesting that the substitutions identical to A. oryzae RIB40 are the cause of the loss of aflatoxin production in these strains.3.5. RIB40-type sesquiterpene cluster is prevalent among A. flavus clinical isolatesNext, we focussed on the sesquiterpene cluster described by Gibbons et al.30 This cluster differed markedly between A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357.30 All A. oryzae strains and three of eight A. flavus strains are reported to carry the ‘9-gene cluster’ allele.30 In contrast, other A. flavus strains, including NRRL3357, contain the ‘6-gene cluster’ allele. The clusters of the ten clinical isolates investigated in this study were divided into 3 groups. Seven of the ten strains maintained a 9-gene cluster similar to that of A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 6). No 6-gene clusters were found among the ten A. flavus strains. Aspergillus flavus IFM59975 retained the longest cluster among the studied clinical isolates. In comparison with A. flavus IFM59975, the A. flavus IFM55053 and IFM58503 clusters lacked the region containing AFL2G_05186, AFL2G_05187, and AFL2G_05186 genes (Fig. 7). These three strains retained a unique region in the cluster. Analysis using Augustus (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/(9 March 2018, date last accessed)) predicted a large gene in the unique region (Supplementary Fig. S2). Preliminary transcriptomic analysis of A. flavus IFM58503 showed that the region was transcribed to mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3). Three protein sequences of those predicted genes are highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. S4). BLAST homology analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4) identified an ankyrin repeat protein in A. parasiticus (accession number: KJK61165) and a hypothetical protein in Aspergillus bombycis (accession number: OHM48268).Phylogenetic analysis of sesquiterpene biosynthesis gene clusters in 13 nucleotide sequences containing a total of 14,081 positions.

The unique regions shared by IFM55053, IFM58503, and IFM59975 are hatched.Seven of the ten isolates were classified as carrying a 9-gene cluster allele comparable to that of A. oryzae RIB40. Interestingly, three A. flavus strains possessing the 9-gene cluster allele, SRRC1357, SRRC2112, and SRRC2524 described by Gibbons et al.30 were of Eurasian origin. Together with their data, our findings suggest that the 9-gene cluster, but not the 6-gene cluster, are prevalent in Eurasia and Japan. Three strains share a unique region that encodes a hypothetical protein homologous to an Ankyrin repeat protein. The products of these clusters remain unknown. The cluster that includes a unique gene is expected to produce a novel sesquiterpene. Further investigation is warranted to identify the product.3.6. Intergenic region between ustT and ustR is conserved in all studied clinical strainsThe ustiloxin biosynthesis gene cluster was found in all clinical A. flavus isolates. Ustiloxin, originally found as a secondary metabolite of Ustilaginoidea virens, inhibits microtubule assembly.31,32 Umemura et al. have identified a gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of ustiloxin B in A. flavus.33,34 As shown previously,33 the intergenic region between ustT and ustR is absent in A. oryzae RIB40, which leads faults in ustiloxin B production. Our sequence data indicate that the intergenic region is retained in all strains. Transcriptomic analysis of A. flavus IFM58503, a strain confirmed by mass spectrometry to be involved in ustiloxin B production, indicated that ustR transcription starts about ~200 bp upstream of the start codon (data not shown). This region is missing in the A. oryzae RIB40 genome, suggesting that the absence of ustiloxin B production in this strain is induced during domestication and causes the fault in ustR transcription.3.7. Other clusters and regions showing important differences between A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40Nine regions with clear differences between A. oryzae RIB40 and A. flavus NRRL3357 are listed in Table 3. AFL2G_11806 and AFL2G_04006 are NRPS in cluster #34 and PKS in cluster #52, respectively. These genes are found in neither the ten clinical isolates nor A. oryzae RIB40. A ~23 kb region containing cluster #34 of A. flavus NRRL3357 was not found in the ten clinical isolates or in A. oryzae RIB40. Instead, A. oryzae RIB40 and the ten clinical isolates have a shared region. In cluster #52, a ~13 kb region was found in neither the ten clinical isolates nor in A. oryzae RIB40. Cluster #49 is known as a homologue of the 10, 11-dehydrocurvularin biosynthetic cluster in A. terreus35 and was not found in A. oryzae RIB40. The cluster is located in the telomeric region of the left arm of chromosome 3 (Supplementary Fig. S5a). Two PKS genes, afcurS2 and afcurS1, are encoded by the cluster.35 All strains except for A. flavus IFM60655 retained these genetic regions (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Among these, the A. flavus IFM57535, IFM58503, and IFM61226 clusters were highly conserved compared with that of A. flavus NRRL3357 (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Half or more strains did not retain the A. flavus NRRL3357-unique region in four other clusters, except in cluster #75, as shown in Table 3. Additionally, ~63 and ~19 kb regions were retained in only one and two clinical strains, respectively. On the other hand, some A. oryzae RIB40-specific regions were found on the genome. A ~25 kb region, including an NRPS AO090026000585, (cluster #61) was only found in A. flavus IFM54693. On chromosome 8 of A. oryzae RIB40, reads from each strain were mapped infrequently to a ~300-kb region from AO090010000234 to AO090010000317, which was also not found in A. flavus NRRL3357. Those differences might become a factor of strain individuality.

Conclusive remarksThis study provides the genome sequences of A. flavus isolated from clinical specimens in Japan. The phylogenetic analysis based on identified SNPs showed that five of the ten isolates were grouped with A. oryzae RIB40, while other 3 isolates with A. flavus NRRL3357. Two isolates, A. flavus IFM57535 and IFM60519, were placed between the two groups. To distinguish between A. flavus and A. oryzae is difficult by partial sequencing of regions such as ITS. As shown in the review by Frisvad36, A. oryzae is a domesticated strain of A. flavus. The fact that A. flavus IFM59975, IFM59894, and IFM61224 were grouped with A. oryzae RIB40 in phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are likely to be wild forms of A. oryzae in Japan and perhaps the causative agent of aspergillosis.Specimens isolated through the oral cavity, such as gingival and sputum samples, may possess the risk of contamination of oral fungi, because ‘koji’-based foods are commonly consumed in Japan and might result in contamination in oral specimens. As discussed previously, the presence of multiple copies of a-amylase is a common characteristic of A. oryzae24.oryzae.24 Although A. flavus IFM54693 and IFM60655 have previously been identified as A. flavus based on the ITS sequences, those strains might be reclassified as domesticated A. oryzae because of their possession of multiple a-amylase genes. The difference in sequence between the original and additional copies of a-amylase genes would be useful to discriminate between the wild and domesticated strains.In summary, the genome data obtained in this study will be useful for further analysis of the genomes of clinical isolates of A. flavus and A. oryzae obtained from oversea and Japanese environments. The phylogenetic analysis based on SNPs might enable us to differentiate between A. flavus and A. oryzae.We would like to thank the editor for his valuable suggestions to improve expressions in our manuscript.

Here, we report transcriptome analysis of primordial germ cell, female germline stem cell (FGSC), germinal vesicle and mature oocyte by performing RNA sequencing of freshly isolated cells in mice. As expected, these stages and gene-expression profiles are consistent with developmental timing. Analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation during female germline development was used for confirmation. By pathway analysis and blocking experiments, we demonstrate PI3K-AKT pathway is critical for FGSC maintenance. We also identify functional modules with hub genes and lncRNAs, which represent candidates for regulating FGSC self-renewal and differentiation.

IntroductionIn most multicellular organisms, including mammals, germ cells are the cells from which new organisms originate and thus serve to pass genetic information from one generation to the next. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the first germ cell population established during development.1 PGCs from mice initially become identifiable as a cluster of approximately 40 cells at around embryonic day 7.25 (~E7.25).2,3 They migrate and colonize the genital ridges at ~E10.5.4–6 The PGCs from female embryos with the XX karyotype continue to proliferate until ~E13.5, reaching around 25,000 in number. Subsequently, these cells enter prophase I of meiotic division and then are arrested at the diplotene stage of prophase I of meiosis [germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes]. Upon hormonal stimulation, the GV oocytes complete the first meiotic division with concomitant extrusion of the first polar body [metaphase II (MII) oocytes].However, recent studies have indicated that not all PGCs enter the differentiation pathway.7–14 A study at our laboratory showed that FGSCs can be isolated from the ovaries of 5-day-old and adult mice using immunomagnetic sorting for the mouse Vasa homolog (MVH/Ddx4). After culture for more than 15 months or 6 months, respectively, the FGSCs still exhibited proliferative capacity and a normal karyotype. These cells can produce fertile offspring after transplantation into sterilized ovaries, followed by mating of the recipient with an adult male mouse.14 The presence of FGSCs has also been demonstrated in the ovaries of post-natal rat, pig, and adult women.9–11,15Our previous studies showed that FGSCs subjected to short-term culture shared similar morphological and molecular signatures to male germline stem cells.16 Moreover, DNA methylation (5-cytosine methylation), a repressive epigenetic marker, has a key role in germ cell development.17 Our recent study also showed that it is actively involved in specifying the development potential of FGSCs.18 Recently, one independent group reported that FGSCs isolated from neonatal mice displayed the string-forming features and vigorous mitotic activity at 1-3 days post-partum.19 However, the transcriptome or gene expression network or epigenetic signatures of freshly isolated FGSCs, and the network between the FGSCs and PGCs or the FGSCs and GV oocytes remain elusive. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique for the analysis of was used, making it feasible to analyse the transcriptome and gene expression network of freshly isolated FGSC, and to decipher the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in PGC, FGSC, GV and MII oocyte. These studies are crucial to obtain a deeper understanding of the developmental processes of female germ cells and the molecular signatures of FGSC because the identity and behaviour of a cell are determined by its gene expression network.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsC57BL/6, pou5f1-GFP transgenic mice [CBA-Tg (pou5f1-EGFP) 2Mnn] (Jackson Laboratory) ×C57BL/6 F1 hybrid mice were used. The Ddx4-Cre; mT/mG mice were produced as described previously20 and the Stella-GFPcreERT2 strain was generated as described in Supplementary data.2.2. Isolation and culture of FGSCsFGSCs were isolated and purified from the ovaries of 3-5-day-old mice by the same procedures as used previously.14 Then, the MVH+ cells were plated to mitotically inactivated STO cell feeders. FGSC medium was changed every 2 days and cells were subcultured every 4-5 days. The culture system was maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2, with saturated humidity.2.3. Immunofluorescence and alkaline phosphatase staining of PGCs and FGSCsImmunostaining was performed as previously described.14 Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, washed twice with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (PBST), incubated with 1% PBST for 10 min, blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit MVH (1: 200; Abcam) or goat anti-mouse H3K27me3 (1: 150; Abcam) at 4°C overnight. After incubation, the cells were washed twice and then incubated with secondary TRITC-conjugated antibodies (1: 200; Invitrogen). Finally, the cells were incubated with DAPI and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. For the alkaline phosphatase staining, the samples were analysed using the Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (Millipore), following the manufacturer’s instructions.2.4. RNA isolation and RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from the cultured FGSCs in accordance with the protocol supplied with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Then, 1 µg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase. PCR analyses were performed with Taq DNA Polymerase. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4.2.5. RNA-seq of low-input cellsRNA-seq was performed with PGCs, FGSCs, GV and MII oocytes. The detailed information is included in Supplementary data.2.6. Gene ontology analysisGO analysis was applied to explore the functions of the DEGs identified in this study. It organizes genes into hierarchical categories and can uncover regulatory networks based on biological processes and molecular functions (http://www.geneontology.org) (The Gene Ontology Project, 2017). Specifically, two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to classify the GO category and the GO annotation list is greater than that expected by chance. The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to correct the P-value. We computed P-values for GOs enriched among the DEGs (recommended P-value <0.05).2.7. MeDIP-seqOvaries from 30 female mice (Ddx4-Cre; mT/mG mice, 3-5 days) were collected. Isolation and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of FGSCs from mouse ovaries was performed as described previously.21 The preparation of MeDIP and input DNA libraries were performed as previously described.18 Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted and the residual RNA was removed by RNAse. Then Genomic DNA was randomly sheared by sonication to generate ~300 bp fragments. The fragmented chromatins were pre-cleared and then immunoprecipitated with Protein A + G Magnetic beads coupled with 5-methylcytosineantibody. After reverse crosslinking, MeDIP and input DNA fragments were end-repaired and A-tailed using the NEBNext End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (E7442, NEB) followed by adaptor ligation with the NEBNext Ultra Ligation Module (E7445, NEB). The DNA libraries were amplified and subjected to deep sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq 2000.2.8. Analysis of DNA absolute methylationDNA methylation data was downloaded from published papers.18,22,23 DNA methylation levels detected by reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) were calculated with Bismark tools. Meanwhile, FGSC methylation levels detected by MeDIP-seq were calculated to transfer the absolute methylation through QSEA package with default settings.2.9. Pathway analysisPathway analysis was used to determine the significant pathway of DEGs. Pathway annotations of microarray genes were downloaded from WEGG (http://www. genome.jp/Wegg/). Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the significant enrichment pathway. The resulting P-values were adjusted using the BH FDR algorithm. Pathway categories with FDR < 0.05 were reported. The enrichment provides a measure of the significance of the function: as the enrichment increases, the corresponding function is more specific, which helps us to identify more significant pathways in the experiment. The enrichment is calculated as follows: enrichment =(ngna)/(NgNa) , where ng is the number of DEGs within the particular pathway, na is the total number of genes within the same pathway, Ngis the number of DEGs that have at least one pathway annotation, and Na is the number of genes that have at least one pathway annotation in the entire microarray.2.10. Series clusteringWe selected the genes differentially expressed among PGCs, FGSCs, GV and MII oocytes. In accordance with the different tendencies for RPKM change of genes at different stages, we identified a set of unique model expression tendencies. Using a strategy for clustering short time-series gene expression data, we defined some unique profiles. The expression model profiles are related to the actual or the expected number of genes assigned to each model profile. Significant profiles have a higher probability than expected by Fisher’s exact test and multiple comparison tests.2.11. Weighted gene co-expression network analysisA signed weighted correlation network was constructed for any expressed gene (FPKM > 0.01) across the four developmental phases. The expression value was translated into a Z-score normalization value for the subsequent analysis. An adjacency matrix was constructed by raising the co-expression measure to the power ß = 14, which was used to derive a pairwise distance matrix for selected genes. Based on the resulting adjacency matrix, the topological overlap was calculated. Genes with highly similar co-expression relationships were grouped together by performing average linkage hierarchical clustering on the topological overlap. In addition, the Dynamic Hybrid Tree Cut algorithm was used to cut the hierarchical clustering tree and define modules as branches from the tree cutting. The node centrality, defined as the within-cluster connectivity measures, was used to rank genes for “hubness” within each cluster. For visual analysis of the constructed networks, we exported the network into edge and node list files that Cytoscape can read with a threshold above 0.65 (some networks were too small to use 0.02). Then, we picked up the subnetwork using genes in GO terms that were related to the developmental process by using Cytoscape 3.1.0. We summarized the expression profile of each module by representing it as a module eigengene. Modules whose eigengenes were correlated at a level of r > 0.25 were merged.2.12. miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA target networkWe introduced the Miranda package to predict miRNA target on 3’UTR region of differentially expressed mRNA and the full-length sequence of differentially expressed lncRNA and miRNA sequence. Competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) relations was constructed by a pair of lncRNA and mRNA affected by the same miRNA members. In this network, a circle represents mRNA, a diamond represents lncRNA, and a rectangle represents miRNA; a relationship is represented by an edge.2.13. RNA extraction from low-input cells and XIST validation in FGSCsEight FGSCs were incubated in reverse transcription buffer supplemented with 0.1% NP-40 and RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). Reverse transcription was carried out with random 6-mer primers and dNTP mix (Invitrogen). The mixture was incubated at 50°C for 1 h and then at 37°C for 15 min with RNase H (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified with the Multiple Annealing and Looping Based Amplification Cycles (MALBAC) kit. Then, the cDNAs were subjected to two rounds of PCR amplification to detect XIST, TSIX, and MVH.2.14. Alternative splicing detectionWe selected the Alternative Splicing Detector (ASD, http://www.novelbio.com/asd/ASD.html)24 as a tool to detect the cases with differential alternative splicing based on a bam file after mapping and using the mouse genome sequence as a reference, according to P-value <0.05.3. Results3.1. Collection and biological characteristics of female germ cellsTo perform RNA-seq analysis of female germ cells at different developmental stages, we collected PGCs, FGSCs, GV and MII oocytes from 12.5 days post-coitum (dpc), neonatal and adult ovaries, respectively (see Materials and methods, Fig. 1A, Supplementary Table S1). For PGCs and FGSCs, we used two-step enzymatic digestion and MVH-based immunomagnetic isolation and sorting or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for analysis of DNA methylation in FGSCs (see Materials and methods). Most of the sorted cells were characterized by the round or ovoid shape with a large nucleus and small cytoplasm (Fig. 1A I, II). Furthermore, these cells were confirmed as germ cells by MVH expression (Fig. 1B I–III, Fig. 1C I, III). The sorted cells were also positive for OCT4 and alkaline phosphatase staining (Fig. 1B IV-IX, Fig. 1C II). After culturing for 2 days, the sorted FGSCs appeared as grape-like clusters (Fig. 1D I). In addition, FGSCs still expressed MVH,25,DAZL [deleted in azoospermia-like]26 and DPPA3 [developmental pluripotency-associated 3],27 but didn’t express C-KIT [also referred to as SCFR, stem cell factor receptor],28,SYCP3 [synaptonemal complex protein 3]29 and ZP3 [zona pellucida glycoprotein 3]30 after long-term culture (Fig. 1D II-IV).

Transcriptional profiles of female germ cells at different developmental stagesUsing the Illumina Hiseq 2500, we performed RNA-seq of 5-8 cells for PGCs, FGSCs, GV and MII oocytes and generated 173.1 million reads to detect the genes expressed in female germ cells at different stages, with a read length of 100 bp (Supplementary Table S2). For each high-throughput sequencing analysis, two biological replicates were performed. Because of the low-input samples, we first perform Fast-QC to control the data quality. We acquired the Q-score higher than 30 (error rate < 0.1%) for each replicates, indicating the sequencing quality is very solid (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Finally, we detected on the average expression of 17,805 (47%) out of 37,980 Refseq genes. Nearly half of the known mouse genes were expressed in the female germ cells, especially in FGSCs, expressing 18,727 (49%) out of 37,980 Refseq genes. To explore whether these gene expression profiles correlated with the developmental stages, we used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to analyse the RNA-seq data. The results showed that these female germ cells were accurately in accordance with the developmental order, from PGCs to FGSCs and ends with GV and MII oocytes, as expected (Fig. 2A). The results of principal component analysis (PCA) revealed differences in expression patterns among developmental stages (Fig. 2B). PGCs, FGSCs, GV and MII oocytes were clustered separately in the PCA plots, suggesting they are four distinct stages. GV and MII oocytes were close together, indicating relatively similar transcriptomes between these two stages (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the correlation coefficient of each replicated sample show very good consistency (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The results from a pairwise comparison of gene expression for all female germ cell stages also demonstrated stage-specific gene expression patterns (Fig. 2C I-III). For instance, as many as 6,846 genes showed differential expression between FGSCs and GV oocytes (Fig. 2C II). Interestingly, the majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) could be clustered into four distinct stages reflecting stage-specific expression patterns and may thus play critical roles during female germline development (Fig. 2D).Global expression patterns of known RefSeq genes in the mouse female germline development.

Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns during female germ cell developmentTo carry out genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of female germ cell development, we firstly performed MeDIP-seq analysis of freshly isolated FGSCs as we described previously.18 We generated 32.9 million sequencing reads; nearly 50% were uniquely mapped to the mouse reference genome. The sequencing reads were further processed to profile DNA methylation signal. Next, we analysed the latest data for genome-wide DNA methylation from PGCs,22 GV oocytes and MII oocytes.23 The result showed that PGC has relatively lower methylation level. Following the sex determination, FGSC also maintain lower methylation, while increases methylation with differentiation into GV and MII oocyte (Fig. 3A). This verified the results from RNA-seq data of female germ cells at different stages. To make it clear whether there is epigenetic pattern alteration between freshly isolated FGSCs and the cultured FGSCs,18 we also performed the genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of these two populations. We observed that the raw sequencing datasets were fairly correlated (Fig. 3B). The fresh and cultured FGSCs showed very similar DNA methylation pattern, evidenced by both chromosome scale and Stra8 locus (Fig. 3C). Next, we examined methylation status of CpG islands (CGIs) in the genome of fresh and cultured FGSCs. We found more than 95% methylated CGIs in cultured FGSCs were recaptured in fresh FGSCs (Fig. 3D). We performed functional annotation of shared methylated CGIs. Consistent with our previous finding,18 we found the enriched items were mostly related to somatic development (Fig. 3E). Together, these observations suggest DNA methylation pattern of cultured FGSCs was almost identical to that of fresh FGSCs.Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns during female germline development and methylome comparison of fresh and cultured FGSCs.

Pathway analysis of the DEGs in female developmental stagesTo explore the pathways that are involved in biological processes during female germline development, we used a Bayesian model-based clustering method31(for details, see Materials and methods) to analyse the DEGs from PGCs to MII oocytes.29 In accordance with different tendencies for RPKM change of genes under different situations, we identified 26 unique model expression tendencies (Fig. 4A). Using a strategy for clustering short time-series gene expression data, we defined 13 significant unique profiles. Significant profiles have a higher probability than expected by Fisher’s exact test and multiple comparison tests. Then we enriched signalling pathway of the DEGs, and found that tendencies 1 and 10 showed gradual downward trends from PGCs to MII oocytes, which were thus deduced to be related to the self-renewal of FGSCs. In contrast, tendencies 8 and 24 exhibited increasing trends from FGSCs to GV oocytes, suggesting that these two groups are related to FGSC differentiation. Intriguingly, tendencies 1/10 shared a pathway, PI3K-AKT (Fig. 4B I), while tendencies 8/24 shared the TGF-ß pathway (Fig. 4B II), suggesting these two pathways play vital roles in maintaining the self-renewal and regulating the differentiation of FGSCs, respectively.The regulation of biological process and pathway analysis during mouse female germline development.

XII, XIII: qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the downstream target genes for AKT . *P < 0.05, Student’s t-test, compared with control.To confirm the role of PI3K-AKT signalling pathway in FGSC self-renewal and survival, we added the AKT inhibitor IV to the medium of FGSCs. As expected, we observed that the proliferative capacity of FGSCs was significantly reduced (Fig. 4C I, II, IX). Furthermore, EdU incorporation assay showed that the proportion of EdU-positive cells was dramatically decreased with the AKT inhibitor IV (Fig. 4C III-VI, X). To observe cell apoptosis when the PI3K-AKT pathway was inhibited in cultured FGSCs, we stained cells with Annexin V and PI to assess apoptosis (Annexin V+/PI-) and cell death (Annexin V+/PI+) upon AKT inhibitor IV treatment for 2 days. This analysis revealed increased proportions of both apoptotic and dead cells in the AKT inhibitor IV-treated FGSCs (Fig. 4C VII, VIII, XI). qRT-PCR experiments that we carried out on the downstream target genes of AKT showed that RAF1, CCND1 and P53 were down-regulated, while P21 and BRCAL were up-regulated, when AKT was inhibited, which was compatible with the present data set (Fig. 4C XII, XIII, Supplementary Fig. S2). For TGF-ß pathway, a previous study identified BMP4 as a key regulator of PGC differentiation.32 In addition, the output of in vitro-derived oocytes was significantly increased upon BMP4 supplementation because it could activate SMAD1/5/8 and key meiosis-initiating genes in FGSCs (or OSCs).33 These results suggest that the TGF-ß superfamily might regulate FGSC differentiation during mouse oogenesis. This finding matches the results from the pathway analysis, which further validates the RNA-seq data.3.5. Gene expression dynamics during the development of female germ cellsTo further clarify the molecular characteristics of early-staged female germ cells, especially FGSCs, we monitored the dynamic expression of germline and core stem-cell genes. We first analysed key genes associated with PGC specification and germline development. The expression of FRAGILIS, PRDM14, MVH, OVOL2, PRMT5, PUM1, GJA1, REX1 and NANOS3, tended to decrease over the course of oogenesis, which is compatible with previous reports.34–41 Conversely, the expression levels of DAZL and STELLA tended to increase gradually during these consecutive stages (Supplementary Fig. S3A), which is probably related to their regulating functions in the female developmental process. To confirm these findings, we used qRT-PCR to verify the transcriptional change of ZP1, ZP3, SYCP3, FKBP9, FHL1 and REX1, which are all consistent with the RNA-seq data analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Meanwhile, we used Stella-GFPcreERT2 mouse strain (see Materials and methods) to track the protein activity of Stella. Interestingly, the dynamic pattern of the Stella protein coincided with its mRNA expression as determined by the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq analysis42 (Supplementary Fig. S4), which in turn confirmed the validity of our RNA-seq data.We then analysed meiotic and oocyte specific genes. The results showed that early meiotic genes, SYCP1, SYCP3 and MOS, were dramatically up-regulated during the meiotic progression from FGSCs to oocytes, supporting their critical roles in meiosis of female germ cells. Accordingly, during the differentiation process from FGSC to oocytes, we found clear up-regulation of oocyte marker genes, including ZP1, ZP3, GDF9, OOG1, NLRP5, NOBOX, LHX8, and BMP15, suggesting that they play regulatory roles in oocyte formation.Furthermore, we analysed the core stemness genes (DTYMK, ZMYM4, AW549877, NMEL, FKBP9, FHL1 and CCS) during these stages.16 Intriguingly, these genes showed a global down-regulated trend, especially upon the transition from FGSCs to GV oocytes. The expression pattern of these genes is probably involved in early-stage female germ cell proliferation, especially cell fate specification of FGSCs.3.6. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis for the female germline developmentTo investigate the co-expression relationships among female germ cell developmental stages with specific gene-regulatory modules, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in this study.43,44 This unsupervised and unbiased analysis identified distinct co-expression modules corresponding to clusters of correlated transcripts (Fig. 5A). By applying WGCNA independently to our mouse RNA-seq data (RPKM > 0.1), we found that female germline development involves 25 co-expression modules (Fig. 5A). When we merged the modules that perform the same or similar functions in a particular stage, four composite modules were obtained. Interestingly, these modules showed stage-specific expression; that is, they comprised genes that tended to be specifically expressed in a single developmental stage. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment showed that stage-specific modules shared stage-correlated biological processes, such as RNA processing, cell division and cell cycle (PGCs), mitotic cell cycle and nuclear division (FGSCs), gamete generation and sexual reproduction (GV oocytes), and meiotic chromosome segregation, and programmed cell death (MII oocytes) (Fig. 5B), indicating accurately step-wise developmental progression. We then examined the distribution of module expression during development, showing that the PGC modules undergo gradual degradation over the course of development, whereas the modules in the transitions from FGSCs to GV oocytes or from GV to MII oocytes showed trends of a sharp degradation and continuous activation (Fig. 5C). WGCNA revealed gene-network modules enriched in the female germline. (A) Hierarchical cluster tree shows co-expression modules identified using WGCNA.

(E) Hub-gene networks of the FGSC-specific modules. Size of the dots represents hubness.We analysed the correlations between modules and developmental stages (Fig. 5D), demonstrating that mouse female germline development also involved stage-specific co-expression modules. Next, to identify the core stage-specific regulatory genes, we constructed hub gene networks and filtered a cluster of hub genes (Ncapd2, INCENP, Rab5b, PSAP, GTPBP3 and EIF4H) from the FGSC-specific brown, middlelightblue and tan modules, using GO terms most abundantly represented in these modules (Fig. 5E). Collectively, we can speculate that FGSCs may be potentially associated with those hub genes and further specify the stem cell self-renewal through controlling their mitotic progression.3.7. Dynamic expression of long non-coding RNAsTo trace the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in female germline development, we mapped the Noncode v3.0 to the NCBI database, filtered out those less than 200 nt, and retained the ncRNAs from 200 nt to over 100 kb in length.45 Finally, we obtained 7,859 known lncRNAs, including ncRNAs, pseudo-RNAs and miscRNAs. Among these, there were 632 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs. After hierarchical clustering analysis, we found that, like protein-coding genes, these lncRNAs showed very distinct stage-specific expression patterns, suggesting that they have regulatory roles during female germline development (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, we used RNA-seq data that were directly or indirectly mappable to the mouse reference genome, but had no overlap with sequences in RefSeq, NCBI or Noncode v3.0 lncRNA databases, then carried out de novo transcript assembly using the reference-guided assembly software Cufflinks.46 Finally, we obtained 376 novel lncRNAs. Interestingly, 13 novel lncRNAs were highly expressed at the FGSC stage (Supplementary Table S3). Dynamic expression of lncRNAs during female germline development.

Merge (right) of H3K27me3 and DAPI. Scale bars: 10 µm.Recently, miRNAs have been identified to be important regulators of development and homeostasis in mammalians. And lncRNAs were reported to regulate their corresponding mRNAs by acting as a decoy for miRNAs that bind to common sites in the 3' UTR.47 To obtain further insights into the crosstalk of lncRNA, mRNA and miRNA in female germline, we used three hub genes (Ncapd2, CDKN1A and Rab5b), two known germline marker genes (MVH and C-KIT) and one stemness-associated gene (LHX1) to construct the interaction networks. Intriguingly, we obtained functionally characterized lncRNAs, including XIST and MALAT1 (Fig. 6B, C, Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). Using single cells RT-PCR, we identified XIST expression at the FGSCs stage (Fig. 6D), which is consistent with the RNA-seq data. The immunofluorescent results also showed the expected frequencies of Xi-like enrichment for H3K27me3 in FGSCs (Fig. 6D), suggesting that one of X-chromosomes in FGSCs was inactive. Notably, we found ZFP783 could interact with MVH and CDKN1A in FGSCs through miR-6963-3p. Since CDKN1A has been confirmed to be important for maintenance of FGSCs (Fig. 4C XII), this reveals ZFP783 could regulate FGSC germline specification and mitotic cell cycle through miRNA sponge effect.3.8. Dynamic patterns of alternative splicingAccording to the reads that were uniquely mapped to transcript-isoform-specific exons or exon-exon junctions, we analysed those genes with more than two known transcripts and found that there were 8,532 (52.8%) genes expressed in PGCs, 10,698 (57.12%) in FGSCs, 9,822 (53.3%) in GV oocytes, and 10,161 (53.76%) in MII oocytes (Fig. 7A). This data suggested that the dynamic patterns of alternative splicing (AS) pattern showed variations across female germline development, with the highest proportion occurring in FGSCs, indicating that this specific developmental stage features more active AS and that it potentially contributes to their ability of self-renewal and differentiation. The proportions of known genes with two or more transcripts at the FGSC stage are also shown in Fig. 7B. Dynamic patterns of alternative splicing during mouse female germline development.

(E) Schematic representation of representative AS types of genes related to FGSC self-renewal and differentiation (DTYMK, FHL1, CDK2, SYCP3, and TBP).To further investigate the FGSC-specific AS pattern, we obtained intersection elements of AS between PGCs vs FGSCs and FGSCs vs GV oocytes for subsequent analysis. With an adjusted P-value <0.05, we identified 698 AS events in FGSC stage, including 196 skipped exons, 116 retained intron, 83 alternative last exon, 80 alternative to 5' splice site, 71 alternative to 3' splice site, 53 alternative start exon, 28 mutually exclusive exon and 71 uncommon AS events (Fig. 7C). Surprisingly, we found that, besides cassette, retained intron was the second most prevalent type in FGSCs, which suggested that retained intron also greatly contributed to the molecular features of FGSCs. GO biological process of AS intersection enriched in mitotic cell cycle and spindle organization. Intriguingly, we found G-protein coupled receptor pathway also participated in mitotic process (Fig. 7D). Based on previous study,16 we presented core genes, DTYMK, FHL1, CDK2, SYCP3 and TBP for their AS types (Fig. 7E). DTYMK and FHL1 showed conversion process-specific AS occurrence from PGCs to FGSCs and from FGSCs to GV oocytes. Upon comparing the junction read counts, DTYMK and FHL1 exhibited less exon exclusion at the FGSC stage. While CDK2 and TBP showed a different trend, acquiring the highest proportion of exon exclusion in FGSCs. SYCP3 showed a dramatically high exon-skipping ratio in GV oocytes compared with that in PGCs and FGSCs. Together with those results, dynamic AS patterns could affect the mitotic gene expressions and then contribute to the unique properties of FGSCs.4. DiscussionTo shed more light on the molecular genetics and signatures of early-stage female germ cells, we determined the transcriptome of freshly isolated germ cells using RNA-seq of low-input cells. The results showed that FGSCs were genetically (or evolutionarily) close to PGCs, which are the precursors of germline cells. However, FGSCs also exhibited some unique molecular properties, evidenced by PCA analysis and pairwise comparison of gene expression. These findings provide a comprehensive overview of the transcriptomic landscape of female germline stem cell maintenance, differentiation, and oocyte maturation. Intriguingly, this is consistent with the result from analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation of female germ cells. Moreover, DNA methylation pattern of cultured FGSCs were almost identical to that of fresh FGSCs, suggesting that cultured FGSCs still maintain characteristics of germline stem cells and possess the known molecular signatures of FGSC lines.10,14,20Through the clustering short time-series gene expression analysis, we determined that PI3K-AKT pathway was associated with mitotic activity of FGSCs. With AKT inhibition, we found PI3K-AKT could affect the proliferation and apoptosis of FGSCs through regulating downstream target genes, including BRCA1, P21, P53, CCND1 and RAF1. Previously study showed that P53 is strongly induced in the germline stem cells of dysgenic females, and is required for their maintenance,48 which is also compatible with our results. These findings provide the new insight for future research on the mechanism of FGSCs self-renewal. It has been suggested before that some germline and stem-associated gene clusters are involved in female germline development and stem cell specification. The global expression of each gene cluster was compatible with the pattern reported in previous studies.1,49,50 For instance, early germline specific genes and stem cell-related genes were mainly detected in PGCs and FGSCs, indicating their progenitor or stem cells identity in an undifferentiated state. By contrast, the meiotic or oocyte-specific genes were highly expressed in GV oocytes or MII oocytes. Our results thus clearly revealed the reliability of the RNA-seq data, which will be a stepping-stone towards exploring more innate cellular and molecular signatures of FGSCs.By applying WGCNA analysis, we also found specific relevance between co-expression modules and female germline developmental stages. When focusing on the FGSC-specific modules, we identified six hub genes, NCAPD2, RAB5B, INCENP, PSAP, GTPBP3 and EIF4H, by network construction. Interestingly, NCAPD2 is a target of casein kinase 2, Aurora B and CDK1, which is related to mitotic pathways and cell cycle.51 It contains a nuclear- and chromosome-targeting domain, which interacts with histone H1, H3 and PARP1 in mitotic cells.52 Taking these together, we can deduce that NCAPD2 may serve as a candidate regulator for the self-renewal of FGSCs through cell cycle regulatory subunits of condensing complex and associated chromatin modification.It has been reported that lncRNAs can regulate mRNAs through the miRNA sponge effect. Therefore, we constructed interaction networks with WGCNA-derived hub genes and known genes expressed in FGSCs. As expected, we acquired several clusters of functionally regulating lncRNAs, such as those involved in epigenetic, transcriptional and translational regulation. Notably, XIST induces CpG island methylation by regulating its target genes, and leads to the random establishment of XCI in female germline.53 Furthermore, we confirmed XIST expression and Xi-like enrichment of H3K27me3 in FGSCs. This supported the assertion that FGSCs maintained their internal signatures with one inactive X chromosome. Based on our results, we would like to propose that a small group of germline precursors still retain their stem cell identity through X chromosome inactivation with the interaction of mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA when most of PGCs enter the meiotic pathway.AS of pre-mRNAs provides versatile regulatory mechanism that can affect genomic diversity and functional diversification of proteins.54 During the female germline development, we found that FGSCs showed the highest frequency of occurrence of AS, which revealed that FGSCs acquired more slicing events than other developmental stages. When we got intersection elements of AS in FGSC stage, we were surprised to find that RI and cassette were both critical AS patterns at FGSC stage, which might make a critical contribution to its regulator genes and then affect the stem cell property. Moreover, differential molecular mechanisms allow PGCs to escape the meiotic pathway and continuously maintain their mitotic stem cell identity. Specifically, TBP could recruit PP2A and interact with condensin in order to transmit cell memory through mitosis to the daughter cells.55 To the extent that TBP might be correlated with the transmission of stem cell memory in a manner other than transcriptional regulation, this might involve the delivery of epigenetic information to daughter cells in FGSCs.Overall, this study systematically analysed the morphological and molecular features of PGCs, FGSCs, GV and MII oocytes. Using RNA-seq of known RefSeq genes, known lncRNAs, novel lncRNAs and dynamic patterns of AS, it should be possible to delineate many more developmental stage-specific and regulatory mechanisms behind female germline development and the derivation of functional oocytes from FGSCs. These findings will broaden future applications for other types of stem cell research.Data AvailabilityRNA-seq data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number GSE75738.This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81720108017), National Basic Research Program of China (2017YFA0504201).

IntroductionRice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important staple foods for a large part of the world’s population and the main source of caloric intake. To meet the consumer demands for food by the growing world population from 7.4 billion today to 9.1 billion by 2050, it is needed to increase the cereal production for the food security.1,2 Grain production increases when crop plant flowers at the optimal time.3 Flowering, the transition from vegetative stage to reproductive stage, is controlled by complex internal genetic network and external factors (depends on different biotic and abiotic conditions).4 Therefore, comprehensive understanding about the genetic control of flowering time is essential in crop breeding.Flowering time is a complex trait, which is tightly governed by genetic factors, environmental cues as well as affected by population stratification.5,6 One of the major goals of the modern genetics is identifying the genetic markers or factors those are associated with complex trait.7 For revealing the genetic association of a trait, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as one of the most powerful tool. In GWAS, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are typically examined for association across the genome with the trait of interest. Single-locus analyses are commonly used to estimate the marginal effects of individual SNPs. However, single-locus analysis could identify only the SNPs with relatively large effects, potentially miss the small effect SNPs.8,9 Moreover, the loci identified by single-locus analysis collectively explain only a small fraction of genetic variation of complex trait, leading to the mystery of missing heritability.10,11 Therefore, identification of causal genetic-interaction through epistasis analysis could possibly improve our understanding about genetic regulation of complex traits.12For a pair of genes, each of them may have weak association or no association, but their interactions might have strong association with trait.13 Moreover, epistasis effects could be affected by the additive effects of multiple genes and other environmental factors.14 In addition, population stratification could confound the epistasis effect. As a consequence, the estimated effects could be biased upwards or downwards and standard error of the effects could be largely inflated. Simple epistatic models, those are not considering such important phenomenon may provide biased results.In the past decades several methods and tools have been developed for studying epistasis. Among them PLINK,15 FastEpistasis,16 EpiGPU17 are the widely applied tools for detecting epistasis underlying quantitative trait. These tools focused on parametric or nonparametric based linear regressions which do not control population stratification. In GWAS several methods have been proposed to control population stratification, including principal component analysis18 and mixed linear model.5,19 In epistasis analysis some studies also used principle components (PCs) as covariate for controlling population stratification20,21 which could perform well when the pattern of population stratification is simple22 but may perform poorly in presence of polygenic background effect or multiple level of relatedness.23 However, mixed linear model could control both population stratification and polygenic effect in detecting epistasis which is considered as a best practice in GWAS but creates the additional computational burden and model complexity.To reduce the computational cost and model complexity, the authors of GRAMMAR introduced a two-step approach as an alternative of mixed linear model for single-locus analysis.24 Motivated from this idea, in this study we developed a two-step approach for whole genome epistasis analysis that can control additive polygenic background and population structure. Like GRAMMAR method, in the first step we calculated the breeding values and deducted from the trait values and finally used epistasis model instead of simple GWAS model. We have conducted extensive simulation studies to check the consequence of population stratification and polygenic effect in epistasis analysis and compared the performance of the method under different scenarios. Finally, we applied this method to analyse rice flowering time trait for detecting epistasis.In epistasis analysis, detection of significant epistatic variants contribute to trait of interest is the primary and ultimate goal; however, further functional analysis of the interacting variants is necessary for characterizing the identified genes and constructing the biological link with phenotype.25 Various functional assays such as gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, protein–protein interactions (PPIs), subcellular location (SCL) of the gene/protein, tissue-specific gene expression and others biological information could help to find significant relationship among the candidate genes and phenotypes. With the rising availability of genomic data from different species, functional annotation of orthologous of the identified rice genes may help to reveal novel biological insights. A number of previous studies showed that a large per cent of interactions generally occur between proteins located in the same SCL or/and with a common functional assignment.26,27 Localization and ontology of the candidate genes were used as important indicator for functional study and characterizing epistatic interactions. Moreover, epistasis interactions network could facilitate to reveal the underlying relations, biological mechanisms and important clustering information. We did literature curation to find previously reported flowering time-related genes, seek out various public databases for collecting PPIs and other biological information for intensive functional studies.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsGenotype and phenotype data used in this study were obtained from the rice diversity research platform (www.ricediversity.org). The population was recruited for a large-scale GWAS which included 413 diverse accessions of O. sativa at 36,901 SNPs of the Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array after quality assurance screening.28 All of the SNPs were selected by genotype call rate >70%, minor allele frequency >0.015. Individuals with missing phenotype were also removed from the study population. Missing genotypes were imputed with weighted k-Nearest-Neighbors method,29 based on the five weighted nearest varieties present in the data set. Four hundred and thirteen O. sativa samples were used in the diversity panels that composed of six rice subpopulations, indica, aus, temperate japonica, tropical japonica, aromatic and admixed, which contains 87, 57, 96, 97, 14 and 62 accessions, respectively. Field data of flowering time were collected as the number of days until the inflorescence was 50% emerged from the flag leaf counted from the day of planting. The phenotype data used in this study for flowering time were measured at Faridpur, Bangladesh.2.2. Statistical modelMulti-locus major and epistatic effects may control a complex trait. One of the major assumptions in GWAS is—complex traits are controlled by a large number of common variants with small effects. These genetic effects rarely exceed genome-wide significance threshold. Ignoring effects of the multiple common genetic variants may have large impact on epistasis analysis results. Controlling background genetic effects in time of testing main and epistatic effects were largely studied in QTL mapping era.30–32 Significant background genetic markers selected by using stepwise regression are used as cofactors for controlling genetic background. Phenotype-adjusting method30 was proposed for QTL analysis, and showed that adjusted approach (inclusive composite interval mapping, ICIM) has more power than cofactor model (composite interval mapping, CIM) approach. In GWAS, mixed model approach can control the effects of common variants, where background effects are considered as random. Best linear unbiased prediction using genetic relationship matrix of individual observations exhaust the effects of common variants33 and the prediction generally highly correlate with phenotype.34 We have used a two steps approach for epistasis analysis: (i) predicting the total additive genetic breeding value using mixed model approach and adjusting phenotypic data, and (ii) using the adjusted phenotypic data for whole genome epistasis analysis.We compared the approach with PLINK and PC-linear approaches in terms of power and false discovery rate (see Methods S1 and S2). We conducted Monte-Carlo simulation study for checking performance of the approaches. Details about of genotype and phenotype simulations were discussed in Methods S3 and S4.2.3. Gene annotation of the flowering time associated epistatic SNPsIn total, 589 interactions comprised 499 SNPs were identified by whole genome epistasis analysis (Supplementary Data S1). We used MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project (RGAP) Release 7 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) database to annotate the identified 499 SNPs (Supplementary Data S2). Among them 297 SNPs were annotated with protein-coding genes and rest of them were non-coding (Supplementary Table S1). For the non-coding SNPs the nearest genes were used for functional characterization. NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database was used for gathering more information about identified genes (Supplementary Data S3).2.4. GO and pathway enrichment analysisTo determine whether the annotated genes were enriched for biological or functional significance, GO enrichment analysis was performed using GO analysis toolkit implemented in CARMO.36 A gene set was considered as significantly enriched for GO terms if P < 0.05. The GO treemap showing the biological process (BP) was generated using REVIGO.37 We also performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. For KEGG enrichment analysis, Rice Information GetWay (RIGW) database was used.382.5. PPI searchA large number of rice PPIs were collected from three databases, PRIN,39 RIGW38 and RicePPINet.40 We mapped our detected gene–gene (SNP–SNP) interactions to known PPIs and we hypothesized that some of the 589 epistasis interactions may arise from PPIs. We found 18 pairs of SNP interactions those were within 10 kb of known PPIs.2.6. Orthologous gene and flowering pathway geneGene orthologous between rice and Arabidopsis were obtained from MSU RGAP Release 7 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/). Genes involved in flowering time, flower development and seed development pathway for rice and/or Arabidopsis were downloaded from the database.41,422.7. Subcellular localization predictionWeb-based integrative SCL predictor tool called plant subcellular localization integrative predictor (PSI)43 was used to predict the SCL of the candidate epistatic genes. Finally the genetic network from SNP–SNP interactions projecting various biological information was visualized using Cytoscape 3.5.1.442.8. Tissue-specific expressionWe explored the expression profile of the candidate genes in the six different tissues (i.e. post-emergence inflor, pre-emergence inflor, embryo-25DAP, anther, pistil and panicle). Tissue-specific expression of the epistatic genes were obtained from the comprehensive annotation of rice multi-omics data (CARMO)36 annotation platform. The heatmap plot of the expression profile of the genes with dot plot of SCL was constructed using iTOL v3.45 The clustering of the genes presented in the heatmap represents hierarchical clustering.3. Results3.1. Simulation resultsWe used an adjusted statistical approach to detect epistasis in presence of complex polygenic background and population structure. The adjusted approach was compared with two methods: (i) the simple linear regression that implemented in PLINK which do not account population stratification and polygenic effect and (ii) principal component (PC) based linear regression where PCs are used as covariate to control population stratification (Methods S1 and S2). These two methods were abbreviated as PLINK and PC-linear, respectively. Simulations under different scenarios were conducted for comparing the methods in terms of statistical power and FDR (Methods S4). At each scenario, simulations were performed 1,000 times to estimate the average power and FDR.To investigate the effect of population structure for detecting epistasis, we applied previously mentioned three methods to the simulated data that generated from heterogamous population. We calculated the power and FDR for the three methods with varying per cent of genetic heritability and three subpopulation structures (k = 3). Figure 1 shows the effect of population stratification on power and FDR for different genetic heritability. With increasing rates of genetic heritability, the powers of all three methods were increased. It was observed that detection power could be significantly decreased without controlling population stratification. The use of PC as covariate for PC-linear approach could increase the statistical power. Similar increasing rate of powers was also observed for the adjusted method. Besides, it was observed that with increasing rate of the genetic heritability, the FDR of the PLINK was increased, however FDR for PC-linear and adjusted approach were under control. These results suggested that, both power and FDR of classical approach could be poor when the samples come from structured population (Supplementary Table S2). PC-linear and adjusted method could effectively control FDR as well as improve the detection power in presence of population stratification. Model comparisons under structured population. (a) Power and (b) FDR comparison at different genetic heritability for structured population and samples were considered from three different populations (1,000 sample size with 400, 300 and 300 sample for three populations, respectively). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNARES online.Model comparisons under structured population.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNARES online.Next, the influence of polygenic effect on epistasis detection was assessed under homogeneous population (scenario-II). For this purpose, polygenic effects were added to the simulated phenotypes, where their contributions to the phenotypic variation were varied (Methods S4). In this scenario, with increasing rate of variance due to polygenic effects (decreasing error variance) the powers of the adjusted method were significantly increased (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table S3). It increased from 61% to 99% with respect to increasing rate of polygenic variation. Powers of PLINK and PC-linear were mostly constant (within 47–51%), because the epistatic variance was fixed. This result advocating that both PLINK and PC-linear methods cannot account polygenic variance and treated as error variance. For case (b) in scenario-II [fixed error variance (40%)], with increasing rate of polygenic variation, the powers were reduced due to decreasing the epistatic variance. However, in this case the adjusted method also performed better. The results in both cases of scenario-II, clearly suggest that, epistasis detection powers of the PLINK and PC-linear approaches could largely reduce due to increasing rate of polygenic effect variation (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table S4).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNARES online.Finally, we investigated the consequence of both polygenic effects and population stratification for epistasis analysis (scenario-III). The results for two different cases: (a) the epistatic variance fixed to 15% and (b) error variance fixed to 40%, were presented in (Fig. 2e and h, Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). The patterns of power comparisons of this scenario were very similar to scenario-II. The difference was that, there had impact of population stratification on the detection power in the cases of scenario-III. In this scenario, the powers were smaller for all methods as compared with scenario-II. Although PC-linear method cannot capture polygenic effect, the power of this method was larger than PLINK because of controlling population stratification. However, adjusted method had superior power due to capturing the polygenic variations and controlling population stratification. The FDR of PC-linear and adjusted methods were reasonable, but PLINK had inflated results (Fig. 2f and h).3.2. Genome-wide epistasis analysis of rice flowering timeWe analysed the flowering time trait to identify the epistatic loci influencing this complex trait. Previous study analysed this trait to identify only the underlying individual loci.28 It was surprising that the previous analysis identified only 2 loci which explain 5% genetic variation, referring most of the variations may come from others types of genetic variants or environment factors. We were interested to identify the epistatic loci for flowering time trait. We used two-step adjusted approach for analysing this complex trait by controlling population stratification and polygenic effects of multiple individual loci (see Method). One of the assumptions about complex trait is that it could be controlled by multiple individual loci with relatively small effects. Before analysing epistatic effects our goal was to control those effects to improve detection power and reducing the FDR. With extensive simulation studies, we showed that adjusting population stratification and polygenic effects could improve the detection power and reduce FDR (Figs 1 and 2).Since, the diverse accession of O. sativa is from admixed population, so it is expected that epistasis analysis using classical model could be bias due to population stratification. We conducted whole genome epistasis analysis using adjusted method by considering the polygenic effect and population structure. Due to small sample size a liberal significance threshold P<9.98×10-8 was used for summarizing the results.10 We identified a total of 589 pairs of SNPs among the 680823450 possible SNP interactions (Supplementary Data S1). We also analysed the trait by using PLINK and PC-linear approaches. We constructed QQ-plot for whole genome P-value for three approaches. QQ-plot showed that the PC-linear and adjusted methods better fitted as compared with PLINK approach (Supplementary Fig. S1).Altogether the discovered 589 epistatic interactions comprised 499 unique SNPs. As the number of unique SNPs are smaller than the number of interactions there should have some hub SNPs those are interacted with many other SNPs. The hub SNPs could be biologically important for the flowering time trait.46 Of the discovered 499 unique epistatic SNPs, more than half (59.51%) were located within known annotated genes (Fig. 3a, d and e, Supplementary Table S1 and Data S2) and approximately one-third (31.86%) were located in chromosome 1 (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Data S2 and S3).

Among the total identified interactions, 26.32% (155 out of 589) were cis-chromosomal interactions through five chromosomes (1, 2, 4, 5 and 11) and the rest 73.68% were trans-chromosomal interactions. Of the 155 cis-chromosomal interactions, 136 were in chromosome 1 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. S3).3.3. Candidate epistatic genes involved in different pathwaysGene enrichment analysis was performed to confirm the involvement and the potential contribution of candidate genes to flowering time and flower development. To do this, genes involved in different flower related pathways in rice and Arabidopsis were obtained and mapped to know whether the genes have relevant functions with flowering related traits (Table 1 and Supplementary Data S4). Among the detected genes nine were involved in rice flowering time pathway and fourteen were in rice seed development pathway. One gene (LOC_Os07g41370, MADS18) was found which involved in all five pathways (Table 1). We have detected several genes which were not previously reported for rice flowering, however their Arabidopsis orthologues have biological function in regulating flowering time or flower development (Table 1). For example, the gene LOC_Os08g42640 was not found in rice flowering time pathway, but its orthologue RFI2 (AT2G47700) was found in Arabidopsis flowering time pathway. From Table 1 it is shown that, among the identified genes ten (Arabidopsis orthologue) were involved in flowering time pathway and four in flower development pathway. These results are suggesting the potential role of epistasis analysis in detecting novel genes.Detected epistatic genes involved in rice and Arabidopsis (orthologue) flowering time or related pathwaysGenes involved in rice flowering time pathway.Genes involved in rice seed development pathway.Genes involved in Arabidopsis flowering time pathway.Genes involved in Arabidopsis seed development pathway.Genes involved in Arabidopsis flowering time gene network collected from FLOR-ID.Arabidopsis orthologous of the corresponding rice gene.Gene symbol of the rice and Arabidopsis identifier.Detected epistatic genes involved in rice and Arabidopsis (orthologue) flowering time or related pathwaysGenes involved in rice flowering time pathway.Genes involved in rice seed development pathway.Genes involved in Arabidopsis flowering time pathway.Genes involved in Arabidopsis seed development pathway.Genes involved in Arabidopsis flowering time gene network collected from FLOR-ID.Arabidopsis orthologous of the corresponding rice gene.Gene symbol of the rice and Arabidopsis identifier.3.4. Functional enrichment analysis of the epistatic genesTo characterize the identified epistatic genes various functional enrichment analyses were preformed. First, we performed GO enrichment analysis and assessed whether the genes mapping to epistatic loci are enriched for GO terms. Significant overrepresentations (<U+2060>P<0.01<U+2060>) were observed for the BP terms ‘defense response’, ‘response to stress’, ‘apoptotic process’ and ‘signal transduction’ (Supplementary Data S5). Since only few BP terms were found as significant, treemap analysis was performed to represent the overall view of BP terms of the identified epistatic genes. As expected, many of the GO terms ‘flower development’, ‘multicellular organism development’, ‘reproduction’, ‘DNA metabolism’, ‘cellular process’ (Fig. 4) were found. We also compared the BP terms of the candidate genes participating in interaction for rice flowering time trait and gold standard genes those involved in flowering time pathway and found a large portion of common BP terms (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S4 and Data S6). Gene ontology biological process treemap. Gene ontology biological process treemap of the annotated genes for rice flowering time.

Gene ontology biological process treemap of the annotated genes for rice flowering time. Sizes of the rectangles are adjusted on the basis of the frequency of the GO terms (Supplementary Data S6) . This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNARES online.We also investigated the overrepresentation of KEGG biochemical pathway enrichment analysis. The most representative pathway was observed for DNA replication (ko03030; P<0.0015<U+2060>). DNA replication is the first and vital process that occurred during cell cycle and cell proliferation and this process is highly related to plant cell growth and development. More recently some studies have established a connection of DNA replication, H3.1 and H3K27me3 to flowering time in Arabidopsis.47,48 Because of the reduction of flow of canonical histone H3.1, propagation of H3K27me3 in the FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C-a repressor of flowering) is affected during vernalization and flowering is delayed. Through vernalization the histone variant H3.1 facilitates H3K27me3 to take place at FLC locus by DNA replication47 indicating towards the probable essential role of DNA replication in rice flowering. Another representative pathway term ‘phenylalanine metabolism’ was found and it involves in biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, including aromatic amino acids and these acids play important roles in plant growth, development, reproduction, defense and environmental stimuli.49,50 We also found some KEGG pathway terms had P-values above the threshold of 0.05 [e.g. ko04144: endocytosis (<U+2060>P=0.115<U+2060>), ko00940: phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (<U+2060>P=0.131<U+2060>), ko00230: purine metabolism (<U+2060>P<0.224<U+2060>)] (Supplementary Data S7). Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes and endocytosis; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and purine metabolism pathway terms were reported for response to early chilling stress of rice49 and response to vernalization of Oriental lily,51 respectively.3.5. Epistatic interactions reveal genetic networkA genetic network was constructed from the identified 589 epistatic interactions and integrated various biological features. By analysing the network, several genes were identified as hub genes based on node degree (Supplementary Table S7). The SNP rs18202417 located in the LOC_Os01g39100 gene was the top hub node (gene) with degree 309 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data S1). This gene encodes a protein containing zinc finger CCCH domain and involved in many BPs such as reproduction, embryo development and post-embryonic development. Another major hub SNP (rs351342502) was detected with node degree 66 that located in the gene LOC_Os06g08520 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Data S1). We also observed that, both hub SNPs had common interactions with other 36 SNPs (Fig. 5). Moreover, based on the topological structure of the network, five major groups were observed those connected with hub genes (Fig. 5). From the network we noticed that, majority of the gene interactions in G3 and G4 is responsible for delay flowering (dashed line), while all of the interactions in G2 and G5 were responsible for early flowering (solid lone) as compared with average flowering time. In G1, only two interactions were found for delay flowering among the total of 309 interactions. Two hub SNPs (rs19539809 and rs19540019) in G4 are located in chromosome 3 and both the variants are near of the gene LOC_Os03g15460. The gene is localized in cytosol and involved in the molecular function (MF) phospholipase A2 activity and orthologue to Arabidopsis phospholipase A2 (PLA2) gene. The MF of PLA2 genes in rice is still poorly known. However, its orthologue plays role in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening in Arabidopsis.52,53 G3 contains 38 SNPs, which are near or within 28 genes, and among the genes 67.85% localize in plastid (Supplementary Fig. S5a), suggesting that perhaps most of the genes of the group involve in photosynthesis. No nuclear gene was found in that group. Network of epistasis interaction for rice flowering time.

As for example, the genes in G1 were significantly enriched for chloride transport, apoptotic process and others, while genes in G2 enriched for wounding and oxidative stress-related process. One and three GO BPs were enriched for G3 and G4, respectively. At significance threshold P<0.05, we found no enriched BP and other GO terms for G5. The lack of overrepresentation for G5 is likely to be only few genes was involved in this group.3.6. Co-location and functional similarity of interacting genesInteracting genes or proteins are expected to have same biological function or located in same compartment. We therefore used GO functional similarity and colocalization as important indicator for further evidence of detected epistatic genes. For assessing whether the interacting genes share similar BP, cellular component (CC) and MF, 47, 96 and 115 pairs of interacting genes were found with similar BP, MF and CC, respectively (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Data S8). Among them, many of the interacting genes have shared more than one domain. As for example, 19 pairs of gene interactions have shared both BP and CC, 13 pairs shared both BP and MF and 28 pairs shared CC and MF (Fig. 5c). Moreover, 61 pairs of interactions were found those have shared both SCL and GO terms and most of them were for CC. From our results we found that, many genes localized to multiple compartments (Fig. 6, Supplementary Figs S6 and S7) and many of the interactions of genes were found located in cytosol and plastid (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Expression profile of the candidate genesTo further characterize and confirm the involvement of the epistatic genes in rice flowering, expression analysis was performed. For this purpose gene expression of six tissues, i.e. post-emergence inflor, pre-emergence inflor, embryo-25DAP, anther, pistil and panicle were obtained and plotted using heatmap (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Expression analysis was conducted separately for the genes those clustered into five groups in the network (Fig. 5a). We applied hierarchical clustering to cluster the genes. From the heatmap plot it was observed that, in every group some genes highly express across all six tissues. We also noticed a large per cent of candidate genes in every group were preferentially expressed in panicle (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6). These results support the evidence of the involvement of the identified epistatic genes in rice flowering.3.8. PPIs corresponding to identified epistatic interactionsWe further investigated whether there have overlap between detected epistasis and known (PPIs) in the chromosomal location. Known rice PPIs obtained from three databases, PRIN,39 RIGW38 and RicePPINet40 were used (see Method) to search overlap between detected epistasis and the biological interaction. We found several pairs of genes harbouring SNPs interactions which were also predicted for PPI (Fig. 5). Eighteen pairs of SNP interaction comprise to 12 pairs of gene interactions were overlapped to 3 different databases. Of these interactions, three, five and six pairs of interactions were overlapped with the PPIs of three databases RicePPINet, RIGW and PRIN, respectively (Supplementary Data S9). Among all overlapped interactions two pairs were common between RicePPINet and PRIN and only chromosome 11 had four pairs of cis-chromosomal interactions (Supplementary Data S9). RicePPINet also provided other additional information such as interaction probability and co-expression between two interacting proteins (Supplementary Data S9). The PPI of the two genes LOC_Os11g07120 and LOC_Os11g36190 showed higher probability (0.884) and the remaining two interactions have moderate probability (>0.5). In the interaction LOC_Os11g07120 × LOC_Os11g36180, the level of co-expression is more than 0.5 (Supplementary Data S9). These results clearly reinforced the validity of our findings.4. DiscussionFor a complex trait like flowering time, it is crucial to discover how multiple genes regulate the trait. Epistasis analysis is recognized as powerful technique for identifying novel genes and improves our understanding in the genetic regulation of complex trait.8,54,55,56 However, some reports argue the relative importance of epistasis because of the low contribution of genetic variation.12,57,58 The lack of success to dig out big amount epistatic variance does not imply non-existence of the epistatic gene action.59 Low contribution of epistasis could be due to considering epistasis model for only the loci with moderate or high marginal single-locus effects. Another important reason could be avoiding the confounding due to population stratification and polygenic effect in detecting epistatic interaction that leading to false-positive or false-negative results.14,19 Therefore, exhaustive epistasis analysis by controlling population stratification and polygenic effect is needed to uncover the underlying structure, genetic pathways and understanding the function of complex genetic system.12In this study, we used an adjusted epistasis analysis approach to identify significant epistasis interaction under the condition of polygenic effects and population stratification. Extensive simulation studies showed that adjusted approach could improve epistasis analysis results over classical approach in terms of power and FDR in the case of polygenic effects and population stratification (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs S11–S13, and Tables S1–S5). Epistasis detection powers were relatively low under all simulation scenarios for classical model implemented in PLINK. Under all scenarios, the FDR of PLINK method was higher than other two methods except the scenario considering only polygenic effect (Fig. 2b and d). In this scenario no significant difference was observed in FDR between models. In previous GWAS also reported that the tests could control the Type I error rates satisfactorily.60 These results refer that the effect of polygenicity is responsible for repress the main effect as well as epistasis effect which decrease the detection power if not controlled.For reducing the computation cost, most of the time epistasis analyses have been conducted for the SNPs, which are nominally significant in the single-locus analysis.61,62 We performed whole genome pairwise epistasis analysis for rice flowering time and identified 589 epistatic interactions comprised 499 SNPs. By comparing to previous study result,28 we observed that none of the identified SNPs in epistasis analysis were detected in the single locus analysis (Supplementary Fig. S9), advocating the necessity of whole genome epistasis analysis.Different genomic features such as GO, biological pathway, PPIs, SCL and tissue-specific expression can be used to characterize the identified epistatic loci and these analyses could provide new insights into the biological function of the candidate genes. For example, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the candidate genes showed that signal transduction, response to stress, DNA metabolic process are most significant GO BP terms, while DNA replication, phenylalanine metabolism and ribosome biogenesis are the most relevant pathways (Supplementary Data S5 and S7). Several genes were not statistically significant in enrichment analysis but are involved in the BP cell cycle, cell growth, cell death, flower development, embryo development and metabolism (Fig. 4) which are closely related to rice flowering. The pathway DNA replication was found as significant which helps H3K27me3 to take place at FLC during vernalization and promotes flowering47,48 while phenylalanine metabolism involves in biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids those might play vital roles in plant growth, development and reproduction.49,50 These enrichment analysis results indicate the involvement of the candidate genes in flowering development.Epistatic interactions represented by network can reveal the global picture of gene connections. In our result it was observed that, interacting genes formed hub sub-networks by connecting with hub genes (Fig. 5) and these hub genes might have vital role for interaction and may lead to important biological functions.63 As for example, the hub gene bip110 were found for seed development42 and the hub gene LOC_Os01g39100 localized to nucleus, encodes zinc finger CCCH domain and might involve in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice like Ehd.64Gene expression profiles have long plays fundamental role in evolution65 and gene’s expression across tissue could help to reveal the function and important role of those genes.66 We used the expression profile of candidate epistatic genes across different floral tissues and found majority of them expressed in panicle and other floral tissues (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6), supporting the genetic evidence for the identified epistatic genes involving in rice flowering.It is hypothesized that, to interact proteins or genes, the interactome tend to be located in the same SCL, or in physically adjacent SCLs.67 Moreover, similarity between two genes ontology have been employed as an additional criteria of confidence for a predicted interaction.68 Different genomic features and biological information such as PPI, SCL and GO terms were combined in the network to validate our findings. A total of 392 (66.55%) interactions were found those either located in the region of known PPI or/and overlapped with SCL or/and GO terms (Fig. 5). Moreover, in different circumstances proteins migrate between compartments and therefore could have interaction partners in both locations.69 For instances, among the identified epistatic genes, 11 were found those involved in the BP protein ubiquitination (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data S6). It is well known that protein ubiquitination alter their cellular location, affect their activity and promote or prevent protein interactions.70,71 A significant number of interacting genes were found between nucleus–cytosol, plastid–cytosol and nucleus–plastid (Supplementary Fig. S8) suggesting the proteins may have been switched to the cytosol from other compartments.We also found 37 SNPs harbouring 25 genes those involved in rice or/and Arabidopsis (orthologue) flower related pathway among them 12 genes were common (Fig. 5b). Six genes were found in Arabidopsis floral pathway, indicating novel genes for rice and might have association with rice flowering time. According to our epistasis and functional analysis results, we may conclude the identified genes might be biologically plausible for flowering time.The authors would like to thank the rice diversity research platform for sharing the data used in this study.

IntroductionRhodotorula is a group of yeasts belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota, family Sporidiobolaceae, and class Microbotryomycetes. These are found from widely varying environmental sources ranging from extreme climates of deep-sea vents to arctic cold deserts1,2 from the soil, air, or as organisms associated with plants. Clinically Rhodotorula sp. is described as an opportunistic pathogen that causes pathogenesis in immune-suppressed patients with most cases reporting the causal organism to be R. mucilaginosa.3 However, plant-associated Rhodotorula sp. appears to have several beneficial effects on the host rather than any deleterious effects. Rhodotorula graminis strain WP1 v1.1 was isolated from poplar as an auxin producing yeast4 having significant plant growth promoting (PGP) effects.5,Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (previously Rhodotorula rubra) TG-1 was reported to exhibit strong biocontrol activity against fungal and bacterial pathogens upon stem inoculation of rice.6 Although several Rhodotorula yeasts have started being described from plants, their interaction with plants and their life-strategies have not yet been studied.Rhodosporidium is a sexual, dimorphic red yeast belonging to the family Sporidiobolaceae7 that also includes Rhodotorula. Haploid yeast cells of Rhodosporidium belonging to opposite mating types can conjugate leading to the formation of dikaryotic mycelia.8 However, unlike Rhodosporidium, Rhodotorula is considered to be monomorphic i.e. consisting of the asexual haploid yeast-form with no transition between yeast and filament-forms.9 This is the major distinction between the genus Rhodosporidium and Rhodotorula. The genome sequence of the haploid Rhodotosporidium toruloides NP11 has become available.10 Several other Rhodotorula genomes have been sequenced, such as R. graminis strain WP1,11 a eurypsychrophilic strain, R. sp. JG1b isolated from permafrost in Antarctica,12 and R. mucilaginosa strain C2.5t1 isolated from cacao seeds.13Rhodotorula mucilaginosa strain JGTA-S1 was isolated as an endophyte of Typha angustifolia, a wetland macrophyte growing in the metal-contaminated Uranium-mine-associated wetlands in Jaduguda, India.14 JGTA-S1 promoted the growth of its natural host, T. angustifolia. We undertook a comparative genomics approach to understand the of the yeast in planta contributing to its endophytic life-strategy lifestyle and validated at least some of the attributes through experimental approaches that make JGTA-S1 unique. We sequenced, assembled, annotated the genome of JGTA-S1 and compared it to the sequenced genomes of some Rhodotorula yeasts and R. toruloides. The genome of JGTA-S1 was found to be haploid, with a low repeat content. Comparisons showed all five genomes under study to encode for genes with the potential for benefitting plant growth through phosphate solubilization and phytohormone production. In addition, the genomes appeared to have conserved strategies for adaptation to cold temperatures. The yeasts encoded genes suitable for bypassing plant defence using multiple tactics to facilitate establishment within the plant endosphere. JGTA-S1 was however different from Rhodosporidium and R. graminis in its nitrogen (N)-metabolism because of a truncated nitrate assimilation pathway which probably led to its association and maintenance of diazotrophic endobacteria leading to complex interaction. JGTA-S1 had an intact mating locus showing that it may undergo a filamentous intermediate in its lifecycle like Rhodosporidium.2. Materials and methods2.1. Endophytic colonization of JGTA-S1Typha angustifolia seeds were surface sterilized and grown on artificial soil (Soilrite, Keltech Energies, India) supplemented with 2× Murashige Skoog salt mixture (MS, 15 ml media per 30 g soil) with or without R. mucilaginosa culture (107 cfu of JGTA-S1 suspended in 10 ml 1× MS). The yeast was added dropwise around the root of the plants and the plants were grown for 2 months. Shoot lengths were measured for control (n = 24) and JGTA-S1-treated (n = 24) plants. The significance of the increase in shoot length was tested by Mann-Whitney test and plotted using GraphPad Prism 5. The Typha shoots of treated plants 3-weeks post-infection (wpi) were hand sectioned and stained with 0.01% Acridine orange. The sections were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX40).2.2. Culture conditions and isolation of genomic DNAGenomic DNA was isolated from a saturated culture of R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1. Yeast cells were collected by centrifugation from 10 ml saturated culture and was resuspended in 0.5 ml of distilled water. The tube was spun for additional 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. The tube was vortexed briefly to resuspend the pellet in the residual liquid. Two hundred microlitre of a solution containing 2% Triton X100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris (pH: 8) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added along with 0.2 ml phenol-chloroform and 0.3 g acid-washed glass beads. The tubes were vortexed vigorously for 10 min and 0.2 ml of Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer was added. The tubes were spun for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The aqueous layer was collected and ethanol precipitated. The pellet was resuspended and treated with 30 µg RNaseA (Himedia) and re-precipitated with 4 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes 100% ethanol at -80°C for 1 h. The tubes were spun at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 50 µl TE.2.3. Library preparation and whole genome sequencingA paired-end library was constructed using the NEXTFlex DNA-sequencing kit (BIOO Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) and sequencing was carried out on Illumina Miseq. The paired-end library had a read length of ~250 bp with an insert size of 130–580 bp generating 10,499,886 paired-end reads at 262× coverage. Library for MinION was constructed with the 2D library preparation kit, SQK-NSK007, and sequencing was carried out on MinION Mk1b using R9 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) in a 48 h sequencing protocol on MinKNOW 1.1.20. Reads generated from the run were basecalled using Metrichor V.2.45.1 and converted to fasta format using Poretools.15 The long-read library consisted of 74,892 reads containing 850,015,301 bp of 1D and 2D data at 42× coverage.2.4. Genome assemblyAdapters and low-quality bases were trimmed from the raw Illumina reads with Trimmomatic.16 Long reads from MinION were error-corrected with Canu.17 Whole genome assembly was carried out with SPAdes18 using the trimmed and error-corrected reads. Polishing of the final assembly was done with Pilon.19 In order to identify the mitochondrial genome, the complete mitochondrial genome of Rhodotorula taiwanenis RS1 (Accession no. HF558455.1) was aligned against A2 assembly with NUCmer. To determine the effect of the MinION reads on the assembly, a MinION-free assembly was carried out with SPAdes using only the trimmed Illumina reads. The quality of all assemblies was evaluated with QUAST20 and MUMmer.212.5. Ploidy calculationKmerCountExact programme from BBmap package (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) was used to determine the ploidy and size of the genome.2.6. Gene prediction and annotationGene prediction was carried out using AUGUSTUS22 with protein sequences of strain Rhodotorula sp. JG1b as the training dataset. Annotation was carried out in two ways. First, proteins were annotated using Blast2GO.23 Second, proteins were queried against NCBI’s nr database using BLASTP searches (E-value < 1e-5) and the annotation of the top hit was fetched from the UniProt database. For Blast2GO, InterProScan was also carried out.24 The KEGG-KAAS server (http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/) was used for pathway annotation. For prediction of carbohydrate-active-enzymes, protein sequences were submitted to the dbCAN server (http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/dbCAN/). Annotation of the mitochondrial genome was carried out with MITOS WebServer (http://mitos.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/index.py). Cluster analysis was carried out with the heatmap.2 function of the gplots package25 in R.2.7. Orthologue predictionFor comparison among the Rhodotorula and Rhodosporidium genomes, protein sequences were extracted from R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1, R. mucilaginosa C2.5t1, R. sp. JG1b, R. graminis WP1, and R. toruloides NP11. For comparison between the yeasts, endophytes, and pathogens from phylum Basidiomycota, protein sequences were extracted from Grammothele lineata, Serendipita indica, R. graminis WP1, Ustilago maydis, Puccinia graminis, Melampsora larici-populina, Microbotryum intermedium, and Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae. OrthoMCL26 was run on these sets and analysed using BLASTP (E-value < 1e-5) and an inflation value of 1.5. Enrichment analysis was carried out with clusterProfiler package27 in R.2.8. Synteny analysisSyntenic blocks between R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 and R. mucilaginosa C2.5t1 were identified by MCScanX28 and DAGchainer29 using a cut-off of five orthologous genes to define a syntenic block.2.9. Phylogeny predictionA phylogeny based on 3,660 single-copy orthologous proteins was inferred from the OrthoMCL-generated orthologous groups. Each orthologous group of proteins was aligned with ClustalW230 and concatenated into a superalignment. Proml31 was used with default parameters to infer a maximum likelihood tree. Similarity among the genomes was inferred from a binary matrix comprising of presence or absence of each orthologous protein. Jaccard distance was used to convert the binary matrix into a distance matrix which was subjected to hierarchical clustering.2.10. Effector predictionSignal peptide-containing proteins were predicted using SignalP V3.032 (Prediction = ‘Signal peptide’, Ymax = 0.5, D score = 0.5, P = 0.9). Presence of transmembrane domains and mitochondrial signal peptides in these proteins was predicted using TMHMM V2.0c (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) and only those proteins with no transmembrane domains were retained in the analysis. TargetP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) was used to predict subcellular localization. Only those proteins predicted to be secreted were retained (Location = ‘Secreted’). Effectors were predicted from secretory proteins with EffectorP (http://effectorp.csiro.au/).2.11. Nucleotide sequence accession numbersRhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 genome sequencing project has been deposited in NCBI under BioProject PRJNA393004 and BioSample SAMN07313544. The genome assembly has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession PEFX00000000. The Illumina and MinION reads were deposited to Sequence Read Archive under accession numbers SRR5821556 and SRR5821557.2.12. Assay of phosphate solubilizationRhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 culture grown for 48 h was spotted on Pikovskaya’s agar plates for qualitative phosphate solubilization assay and halo formation was scored.2.13. Effect of R. mucilaginosa on rice plants in presence of low phosphateRice seeds (Oryza sativa cv. Swarna MTU7029) were surface-sterilized and germinated on filter papers. Four- to five-day-old seedlings of equal lengths were transferred to SoilriteTM containing artificial soil supplied with low-phosphate media [1 µm NaH2PO4 (as only phosphate source), 2.0 mM NH4NO3, 1.9 mM KNO3, 0.3 mM CaCl2.2H20, 0.15 mM MgSO4.7H20, 5 µm KI, 25 µm H3BO3, 0.1 mM MnSO4.H2O, 0.3 mM ZnSO4.7H20, 1 µM Na2MoO4.2H20, 0.1 µM CuSO4.5H20, 0.1 µM CoCl2.6H2O, 0.1 mM FeSO4.7H20, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA.2H20, inositol (10 mg l-1), and Glycine (0.2 mg l-1)] as described before.33 For treated plants, 107 cfu of JGTA-S1 cells suspended in low-phosphate media was added to the soil around a plant root. In control plants, an equal volume of low-phosphate media was supplied. Pictures were taken 10 days post-infection.2.14. Assay of cold tolerance of R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ThyAP4 cells were grown in YPD media to saturation. The cells were spotted on YPD agar at OD600=1.0. The cells were incubated at 30 and 5°C and growth was observed after 4 days.2.15. Real-time PCR of anti-freeze genesJGTA-S1 cells were spotted on tryptic soy broth (TSB) media and grown at 30°C for 4 days. Control cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen after 4 days. For cold treatment, the second batch of cells was shifted from 30 to 5°C and incubated at 5°C for 4 additional days. Primers for anti-freezing genes g5846.t1 (Forward 5’ GGTCTTAAGCCGGTCGTCAA3’ and Reverse 5’AAGGTGGGAGGGGGATAGTC3’) and g5876.t1 (Forward 5’TCGTGTTCCACAGGCTACTG3’ and Reverse 5’TACGGGTCGTTTTCGCAGTT3’) were designed by Primer-BLAST software34 using Rhodotorula sp. JG1b as an organism. For RNA isolation, cell pellets were suspended in urea buffer (urea 8 M, NaCl 0.5 M, Tris 20 mM, EDTA 20 mM, SDS 2%, pH 8). Glass beads and an equal volume of Trizol (Invitrogen) was added to the suspended cells and subjected to vigorous vortexing. Cells were kept in ice every 2 min. Chloroform was added (one-fifth volume) and vortexed again. The solution was kept on ice for 10 min and centrifuged. An equal amount of Trizol was again added to the supernatant and kept in ice for another 5 min. The chloroform step was repeated. The aqueous layer was transferred and precipitated with 50% (v/v) isopropanol and glycogen (1 µg/ml). The RNA pellet was washed with 85% ethanol and dissolved in RNase-free water. RNAs were subjected to DNase treatment and converted to cDNA with M-MuLV reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. An equal amount of cDNA was used for Real-time PCR. A 10 µl of qRT-PCR reaction contained 5 µl DyNAmoColorFlash SYBR Green I master mix (Thermo Scientific), 0.5µM of each primer and 50 ng (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo scientific) of cDNA. Real-time PCR was performed using Step one plus real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The thermal step-up was 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C. Data analysis was performed using ExpressionSuite Software v1.0.4 (Applied Biosystems). The fold change was calculated by 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method using JGTA-S1 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene (Fwd 5’ GAGTTGATGCGCGAGCTGGAGAACG 3’ and Rev 5’ GTGGCCGAGAAGGGTCGGCCGAGG 3’) as housekeeping gene. The primer efficiencies were checked and found to be >90 for every primer pairs using LinReg PCR 2017.1.0.0 software. The result corresponds to two independent experiments each in triplicate.2.16. Effect of removal of endosymbiotic bacteria from JGTA-S1 and real-time PCR of 16SrDNA specific DNAJGTA-S1 was streaked five times in presence of Timentin (250 µg/ml) and Tetracycline (10 µg/ml) on N-free media (5 g Glucose; 0.1 g yeast extract; 0.15 g CaCl2; 0.005 g Na2MoO4; 0.2 g MgSO4.7H20; 0.04 g FeSO4 7H20; 0.5 g K2HPO4; 1.0 g CaCO3; 15 g Agar; distilled water to 1 l; pH 7.0) with 5 g/l (NH4)2SO4. Every time, isolated single colonies were used for streaking. Almost 30 colonies were cultured in TSB and genomic DNA was isolated as described earlier. The genomic DNA was used as a template to screen for colonies where no amplification was observed for Pseudomonas stutzeri 16SrDNA (Fwd 5’AGGCGACGATCCGTAACTGG3’ and Rev 5’GTCATCCCCACCTTCCTCCG3’). The PCR cycle was 5 min at 98°C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 98°C, 15 s at 62°C, 27 s at 72°C with a final extension of 7 min at 72°C. A strain (Strain 11 henceforth) lacking P. stutzeri 16SrDNA amplification in two independent PCR reactions was used for further studies. Strain 11 or JGTA-S1 control cells were grown in TSB or N-free media containing (NH4)2SO4. The cell pellets were washed twice with water and suspended in water. The OD600 was normalized and spotted on TSB and N-free media at different dilutions [undiluted (0.5 OD), 1:100 and 1:1,000]. For qPCR genomic DNA was isolated from JGTA-S1 (control) and Strain 11. Pseudomonas stutzeri 16SrDNA gene specific primers (Fwd 5’ TGAGTAATGCCTAGGAATCTGCC 3’ and Rev 5’ ATCCGACCTAGGCTCATCTGATA 3’) were designed using Primer-BLAST software using Pseudomonas stutzeri DSM 4166 as an organism for qPCR. An equal amount of genomic DNA was used for Real-time PCR. A 10 µl of qRT-PCR reaction contained 5 µl DyNAmoColorFlash SYBR Green I master mix (Thermo Scientific), 0.5 µM of each primer and 1.5 ng (measured in Qubit, Thermo Fisher) of genomic DNA. Real-time PCR was performed using a 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The thermal step-up was 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C. The fold change was calculated by 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method using JGTA-S1 GAPDH gene as housekeeping gene. The result corresponds to three independent experiments each performed in triplicate. The significance of the increase in relative P. stutzeri levels/JGTA-S1 cell was tested by Mann-Whitney test and plotted using GraphPad Prism 5. The primer efficiencies were checked using LinReg PCR 2017.1.0.0 software as described before. A Strain 11.2 was generated from Strain 11. Strain 11 was subjected to one passage in presence of Carbenicillin (100 µg/ml), Gentamycin (30 µg/ml), and Kanamycin (50 µg/ml) in N-free media + (NH4)2SO4. The colonies were revived once by growing them on TSB plate w/o antibiotics followed by another round of streaking in N-free media + (NH4)2SO4 containing Carbenicillin, Gentamycin, and Kanamycin. A primer pair corresponding to the V3 region of 16SrDNA of bacteria (Ba341Fwd: CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG and Ba518Rev: ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) was used for amplification of total endobacteria. Genomic DNA (1 µg, measured by Nanodrop, Thermo scientific) from control, Strains 11 and 11.2 was used as a template. For no template control (NTC) no DNA was added. The PCR cycle was 5 min at 94°C, followed by 11 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 65°C, 3 min at 72°C and 20 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, 3 min at 72°C and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Spotting assay (on N-free media) and qPCR from Strain 11.2 were done as described for Strain 11.3. Results and discussion3.1. Typha endophyte R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 has a compact repeat-poor haploid genomeRhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 was isolated as an endophyte of T. angustifolia. JGTA-S1 was isolated from Typha shoot. An independent isolate of R. mucilaginosa (JGTA-R1, KU051691.1) was isolated from Typha root demonstrating that the yeast was probably able to colonize both shoot and root of Typha. The yeast showed strong growth promoting effects on Typha (Fig. 1a). The increase in shoot lengths of JGTA-S1-treated plants was tested with Mann-Whitney analysis and the median value was found to be significantly increased upon yeast treatment (Fig. 1a, right panel). The endophytic colonization of JGTA-S1 was confirmed by staining shoot sections of Typha infected with JGTA-S1 with acridine orange 3 wpi. JGTA cells were found in Typha sections validating its endophytic colonization (Fig. 1b). To get a better insight into its life-strategy, JGTA-S1 was sequenced on Illumina Miseq at 262× coverage and Oxford Nanopore MinION at 42× coverage. Self-corrected MionION reads were combined with adapter-trimmed and quality-checked Illumina reads to generate a hybrid assembly. Use of Nanopore reads in addition to the Illumina reads resulted in a better assembly comprising of fewer but longer scaffolds and almost 3-fold increased N50 value (Supplementary Table S1) resulting in Assembly A1 (Table 1). This was further improved by removing scaffolds that were <2,000 bp to generate assembly A2 that consisted of only 46 scaffolds, N50 of 685,833, length of 20,108,097 bp where the largest scaffold was 2,159,349 bp (Table 1). KmerCountExact was also able to determine that JGTA-S1 was a haploid genome (Supplementary Fig. S1) of size 21,822,513 bp. JGTA-S1 assembly size was close to the estimated size. Moreover, it had only 46 scaffolds in comparison to the 1, 034 scaffolds of R. mucilaginosa strain C2.5t1. MUMmerplots of NUCmer and PROmer alignments showed colinearity between JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1 suggesting a good agreement between the genomes (Fig. 2a and b). The mitochondrial genome of JGTA-S1 was integrated into Scaffold 2 of the assembly (Supplementary Fig. S2). The annotated mitochondrial genome consisted of tRNA, rRNA, genes encoding ATP synthase subunits and cytochrome oxidase subunits (Supplementary Table S2).Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 colonizes in T. angustifolia endophytically and promotes growth. Typha angustifolia seeds were surface sterilized and germinated on artificial soil. JGTA-S1 culture was added around the root. For control plants, 1× MS was added. Plant length was measured after 2 months. Plant lengths were subjected to the Mann-Whitney test. For determination of colonization, Typha shoots were hand sectioned and stained with Acridine orange 3wpi.

JG1b for training AUGUSTUS.22 A total of 5,922 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome of R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 (Table 2). The average gene lengths, mean exon lengths and mean intron lengths were determined to be 2,778, 275, and 134 bp, respectively (Table 2). It was found to average 200 genes Mb-1 with the densest region having ~350 genes Mb-1 which is within the range reported for Puccinomycotina genomes.35 The same gene prediction protocol resulted in 6,463 predicted genes in R. mucilaginosa C2.5t1 (Table 2). The UniProt and Blast2GO annotations of JGTA-S1 are presented in Supplementary Table S3. Among the top 5 GO terms in ‘Biological Process’ were those involved in the N-metabolic process (Supplementary Fig. S3).Gene prediction statistics for R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1CDS: Coding sequence.Gene prediction statistics for R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1CDS: Coding sequence.The previously reported C2.5t1 genome had numerous scaffolds, so the C2.5t1 genome was scaffolded using an in-house assembler with the JGTA-S1 genome as a reference assembly (https://github.com/madhubioinfo/STLab-assembler). This assembler aligns scaffolds to a reference genome using length cut-off of 1,500 bp (–maxgap = 500 –mincluster = 100) and >97% identity to eliminate the poorly aligned region. The scaffolds were then ordered based on the reference assembly and the gaps were filled with Ns. Subsequently, the scaffolded assembly of C2.5t1 also rendered to 46 scaffolds making it easier to compare synteny (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table S4). Forty-four pairs of scaffolds containing 5,359 gene pairs were syntenic between JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1. The two pairs of scaffolds that did not contain significant synteny, i.e. Scaffold 42 (Supplementary Fig. S4a, Scaffold 42 on Y axis and corresponding scaffold of C2.5t1 on X axis) and Scaffold 46 of JGTA-S1 (Supplementary Fig. S4b, Scaffold 46 on Y axis and corresponding scaffold of C2.5t1 on X axis) were small scaffolds (40,000 and 8,000 bp in length) and were most likely caused by a small inversion and a deletion. Overall a one-to-one relationship was observed between pairs of scaffolds of the two genomes again confirming that JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1 were closely related and represented haploid genomes.The genome of JGTA-S1 was compared with the whole genome sequences of four other Rhodotorula genomes and R. toruloides (Table 3). Rhodotorula graminis WP1 was found to endophytically colonize poplar.5,Rhodotorula mucilaginosa strain C2.5t1 was isolated from cacao seeds.13,R. sp JG1b was isolated from permafrost in Antarctica.36,Rhodosporidium toruloides (previously Rhodotorula glutinis) was also found in association with the woody structure of plants.37 Thus Rhodosporidium and Rhodotorula yeasts appeared to have a tendency for plant-association although except for R. graminis strain WP1 none of the other strains have been experimentally demonstrated as endophytes neither have their life strategies been demonstrated in plants. The completeness of the assembly of JGTA-S1 was assessed with BUSCO and compared with the other genomes (Table 3). Thus, the assembly of JGTA-S1 was comparable to the assemblies of the other genomes. Overall the Rhodotorula genomes and the Rhodosporidium were ~20 MB in size. The genome size of this group was small when compared with other classes in order Pucciniomycotina (Supplementary Table S5). This reduction in genome size appears to be a feature common to class Microbotryomycetes. The relationship among the five Rhodotorula genomes was assessed with phylogeny and cluster analysis. A total of 34,483 proteins from the five organisms were clustered into 6,774 groups by OrthoMCL. Phylogeny was inferred from 3,660 single-copy orthologues and showed that JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1 were most closely related to the eurypsychrophilic organism R. sp. JG1b (Fig. 3a). This was compared with a cluster analysis on the presence–absence of all orthologues (Fig. 3b). The two trees had the same topography indicating that the gene content of these organisms reflected their evolutionary history that was largely unaffected by factors such as horizontal gene transfer. Core orthologues defined as orthologues that were present in all five organisms consisted of 4,315 proteins (Fig. 3c) enriched in 88 GO IDs. These core proteins belonged to various biosynthetic pathways, DNA replication machinery, signalling pathways (Supplementary Fig. S5a) and were located in the mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S5b) and functioned as helicases, transferases, and GTPases (Supplementary Fig. S5c). Thus, the core proteome mostly had housekeeping functions. Also included in the core proteome were several plant hormones synthesis pathways, such as cytokinin, auxin, and lipid biosynthesis genes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme (Supplementary Table S6) (discussed below). Thus, all genomes appeared to have host-beneficial and lipid-producing capabilities. The R. mucilaginosas, JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1, and JG1b had smaller genomes and encoded mostly core proteins having very few unique orthologues, i.e. 72 in JGTA-S1, 380 and 406 in C2.5t1 and JG1b respectively. Most of these 72 JGTA-S1 proteins had unknown functions or shared no similarity with any known proteins. Among the proteins having annotations, gag-pol polyproteins that are part of retro elements were a major class (Supplementary Table S7).Relatedness of R. mucilaginosa with other closely related red yeasts. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 (JGTA-S1) genome was compared with C2.5t1 (R. mucilaginosa C2.5t1), WP1 (R. graminis WP1), JG1b (R. sp JG1b) and NP11 (R. toruloides NP11).

Color figures are available at DNARES online.Genomes used in the comparative study and their genome statisticsGenomes used in the comparative study and their genome statisticsOnly 2% of these genomes were occupied by repeat elements (Supplementary Table S8). A higher number of long terminal repeat (LTR) elements (Copia, Gypsy) were found in the genomes of JGTA-S1 (57), C2.5t1 (97), and JG1b (73) in comparison to NP11 (34) and WP1 (26) while a large number of LINES were found in NP11. Overall the LTR repeat content of these genomes was low like that of the corn smut pathogen, U. maydis.383.2. Comparison with other endophytes and pathogensTo determine what genes were common between JGTA-S1 and other endophytes an orthologue analysis was carried out with known endophytes from Basidiomycota. Grammothele lineata—an endophyte that colonizes jute,39,S. indica (previously Piriformospora indica)—a root-colonizing endophyte40 and R. graminis WP141—a poplar endophyte were used in the study. In contrast, pathogens such as the corn smut biotroph, U. maydis,42 wheat stem rust biotroph, P. graminis,43 the poplar rust biotroph, M. larici-populina,44 and two closely related biotrophs, M. intermedium, and M. lychnidis-dioicae45 were included. The Venn diagram shows that 2,996 orthologue groups were shared by all 9 species but only 25 groups were shared exclusively by Rhodotorula (JGTA-S1 and WP1) and the endophytes (G. lineata and S. indica) (red highlight in Fig. 4). These 25 endophyte-specific groups included proteins such as NmrA-domain-containing proteins (Supplementary Table S9). JGTA-S1 encoded 6 such NmrA proteins. NmrA is a transcriptional regulator involved in regulating N-metabolism when different N-sources are available.46 In addition, Rhodotorula and other members of Pucciniomycotina lacked a gene cluster homologous to 19 A coding for secreted effectors in U. maydis47 and some other Ustilaginomycotina. The deletion of the 19 A cluster genes in U. maydis led the mutant to behave like an endophyte. However, in absence of sufficient homology in the region flanking the 19 A cluster of U. maydis with Rhodotorula sp. it is difficult to correlate the lack of 19 A cluster with the endophytic lifestyle of Rhodotorula. On the other hand, Rhodotorula shared a high number of orthologues, i.e. 528 with the pathogens M. intermedium and M. lychnidis-dioicae both of which belong to the same class as Rhodotorula, i.e. Microbotryomycetes. A predominant class of genes common to the Microbotryomycetes was the proteophosphoglycans. These are glycoproteins that in the intercellular human pathogen, Leishmania donovani have been shown to help in attaching to host cell during infection.48 This group of proteins appeared to have undergone expansion in Rhodotorula. JGTA-S1 had 85 copies of proteophosphoglycan ppg4 and 18 copies of proteophosphoglycan ppg5. A search for ‘proteophosphoglycan AND basidiomycetes’ ‘[porgn:__txid5204]’ in the NR database resulted in 1887 hits (search done on 10.05.18). Of those, 81% were hits to Rhodotorula. The role of proteophosphoglycan in fungi is unclear but they may be involved in host cell invasion. Comparison of orthologues of R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 with other Basidiomycetous fungi. OrthoMCL26 was used to infer orthologues for R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1, Umay (U. maydis), Min (M. intermedium), Mld (M. lychnidis-dioicae), Gram (G. lineata), JGTA-S1 (R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1), WP1 (R. graminis WP1), Sin (S. indica), Mela (M. larici-populina), and Pucc (P. graminis).

These include Rhodotorula, Rhodosporidium, Leucosporidium, Microbotryum, and Sporobolomyces.2 Since JGTA-S1 genome showed strong relatedness to the eurypsychrophilic Rhodotorula sp. JG1b that was isolated from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica,34 our genomes were searched for the presence of cold tolerance genes. All five Rhodotorula genomes were found to contain multiple copies of genes encoding putative anti-freeze glycoproteins. These are g574.t1, g736.t1, g5846.t1, g5847.t1, g5875.t1, and g5876.t1 in JGTA-S1 and their orthologues in other genomes are listed in Supplementary Table S10. These proteins found in cold-adapted organisms are known to prevent ice crystal formation enabling growth at low temperatures.49 The ability of R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 to withstand low temperature was tested by growing it at on YPD plates at 5°C. JGTA-S1 showed much better growth at 5°C in comparison to S. cerevisiae strain ThyAP4 4-days post-spotting (Fig. 5a). In accordance with this data, two randomly chosen anti-freezing genes g5846.t1 and g5876.t1 were found to be upregulated 6.6- and 1.9-fold, respectively in a Real-time PCR experiment when JGTA-S1 was grown at 5°C compared with control cells grown at 30°C (Fig. 5b). This result showed that JGTA-S1 was cold-tolerant and the two anti-freezing genes studied were functional. Since the cold-tolerant genes were found both in JGTA-S1 as well as in JG1b, the genes could have similar functions in the other red yeasts as well. Cold tolerance of R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1. JGTA-S1 and S. cerevisiae ThyAP4 cells were grown in YPD medium till saturation and adjusted to an O.D. of 1. The cells were serial diluted and spotted on YPD plates and incubated at 30 and 5°C for 4days. For RNA isolation JGTA-S1 cells were grown at 30°C for 4 days followed by 4 days at 5°C. Control cells were frozen after 4 days of growth at 30°C. Real-time PCR was done with two putative anti-freezing genes. Results are from two independent experiments done in triplicate.

Rhodotorula has a reduced set of CAZY enzymesOverall, JGTA-S1 had only 271 CAZY enzymes (Supplementary Table S11). In order to look for CAZY enzymes that are specific for endophytic function, we compared CAZY families in JGTA-S1 with those of G. lineata, S. indica and R. graminis WP1, U. maydis, P. graminis, M. larici-populina, M. intermedium, and M. lychnidis-dioicae. Interestingly, clustering based on copy numbers of CAZY genes showed that the Rhodotorulas (JGTA-S1 and WP1) were more similar in CAZY profile to M. intermedium and M. lychnidis-dioicae than to endophytes S. indica and G. lineata (Fig. 6b). Only two CAZY families were unique to the endophytes, carbohydrate-binding module 1 (CBM1) and glycosyl hydrolase 88 (GH88) (Fig. 6b). These profiles were present only in JGTA-S1, WP1, S. indica, and G. lineata. CBM1 is a protein domain that binds to polysaccharides and is found in fungal hydrolytic enzymes that degrade plant cell wall. Larroque et al.50 found many CBM1-domain-containing proteins in necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi but no CBM1-domains was found in biotrophic fungi. Our study showed that endophytes also have CBM1 domains and may indeed be more similar to necrotrophs than to biotrophs. It is relevant to mention here that S. indica despite being a PGP fungus was reported to cause host cell death during mutualistic symbiosis.51 Some CAZY families were present in higher numbers in JGTA-S1 such as GT90, GH16 (Supplementary Table S11). The GT90 proteins were associated with capsule formation in encapsulated yeasts.52 GH16 enzymes catalyse the breakdown of ß-1, 3-1, 4-glucans53 commonly found in the cell walls of grasses. JGTA-S1 encodes GH16 enzymes that possibly facilitate penetration and establishment in grasses such as Typha and rice. Several cellulases such as cello biohydrolases (GH6 and GH7), endoglucanases (GH45, GH74) were missing in JGTA-S1. Only glucosidase (GH3) could be detected. Also missing from JGTA-S1 were hemicellulases such as xylanases (GH10 and GH11), arabino uranosidases (GH51, GH54, and GH62), endoarabinase (GH43 and GH93), and xyloglucanase (GH74 and GH12).

CAZY enzymes were inferred from the proteome of JGTA-S1, Umay (U. maydis), Min (M. intermedium), Mld (M. lychnidis-dioicae), Gram (G. lineata), WP1 (R. graminis WP1), Sin (S. indica), Mela, (M. larici-populina), and Pucc (P. graminis).

Color figures are available at DNARES online.3.5. Rhodotorula yeasts encode multiple strategies for establishment and evasion of plant defenceChitin deacetylases of family CE4 were present in JGTA-S1 and the other Rhodotorula and Rhodosporidium genomes (Supplementary Table S11). This enzyme converts fungal chitin to chitosan that helps in avoiding detection by the host.54 Thus, CE4 might play a role in the evasion of plant defence in these organisms.Another way of avoiding chitin-based plant immune response is to scavenge degraded chitin molecules. Fungal LysM domain-containing proteins are chitin-binding proteins that scavenge the degraded chitin molecules that form during fungal penetration preventing activation of plant defence.55 CBM1 proteins described in the section above are LysM domain-containing enzymes. Ten CBM1 proteins were predicted in JGTA-S1 possibly supporting the ability of the fungus to evade plant defence.All the Rhodotorula genomes studied here were found to have at least one copy of salicylate hydroxylase, a key enzyme required for breaking down of salicylic acid (SA), a plant defence hormone that is produced both locally as well as systemically upon encounter with microbe-associated molecular patterns56 triggering plant defence against biotrophs. Salicylate hydroxylase has been reported in the smut fungus U. maydis where it may play a role in biotrophic growth.57 Copies of salicylate hydroxylase were encoded on all genomes such as KWU46987.1 (R. sp JG1b), XP_018270700.1 (R. graminis WP1), g3206.t1, g5580.t1 (C2.5t1), EMS24466.1 (NP11) and g1003.t1, g1030.t1 (JGTA-S1). JGTA-S1 also contained several genes of the Jasmonic acid pathway (g718.t1, g2844.t1, and g4607.t1:Supplementary Table S12). Jasmonic acid is an alternate plant defence hormone known to have an antagonistic effect on SA-mediated plant defence.583.6. R. mucilaginosa encodes genes related to PGPJGTA-S1 genome contained many genes that could potentially influence plant hormonal response. Genes coding for the auxin pathway were found in JGTA-S1. Three genes of the abscisic acid pathway were also found on JGTA-S1. The gene, g288.t1-encoded isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase that is required to convert plant hormone cytokinin from inactive to an active form59 and tRNA-dimethylallyl transferase the first gene in the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway (g5608.t1). The yeast also had the potential to influence Brassinosteroid pathway as it contained several genes required for sterol biosynthesis. JGTA-S1 also coded genes for (R)-acetoin and (R, R)-2, 3-butandiol production that are volatiles produced by many PGP rhizobacteria. All genes related to hormone production are listed in Supplementary Table S12.3.7. Solubilization and uptake of phosphateThe release of phosphate from inorganic or organic sources and its uptake is an important way by which endophytes benefit plants.60 JGTA-S1 contained organic phosphatases (g2241.t1, g4636.t1), inorganic phosphatases (g1099.t1, g3530.t1, g5792.t1, and g2815.t1) and phosphate transporters (g981.t1, g4895.t1, g2031.t1, g660.t1, and g5404.t1) (Supplementary Table S3). We experimentally validated the phosphate solubilization ability of JGTA-S1. Clear zones around JGTA-S1 growth were observed on Pikovskaya’s agar plates (Fig. 7a) which indicated its ability to solubilize insoluble calcium phosphate present in the media. Consistent with this data, JGTA-S1 was able to improve growth in rice plants grown in low-phosphate media (Fig. 7b) in comparison to untreated controls which turned chlorotic 10 days after transfer in low-phosphate media.

Color figures are available at DNARES online.3.8. Effector proteins of JGTA-S1EffectorP was used to predict effectors from secretory proteins. Of the 1, 134 candidate effector proteins identified from the five genomes, only 278 proteins (24.5%) could be annotated by BLASTP against nr database (E value < 1e-05) (Supplementary Table S13) which was not surprising since most effector proteins do not contain domains.61 The effectors were clustered into 223 groups containing 499 proteins while 635 proteins remained as singletons, which mean that most effectors were unique to each organism. Moreover, no conserved motifs could be identified in the effectors. This observation reiterates the finding that fungal effectors are often species-specific and are evolving at a rapid pace such that orthologues of effectors are not seen in closely related genomes.62 The annotated proteins included chitin deacetylase that functions in modifying chitin as mentioned previously, a malic enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthesis and a serine carboxypeptidase. Also found among the effectors were some proteophosphoglycan proteins (Supplementary Table S13).3.9. Rhodotorula encodes an intact mating locusThe mating locus of fungi is responsible for sex determination and filament formation. It consisted of homeodomain transcription factors and pheromone-related genes. An intact MAT locus on Scaffold 13 of JGTA-S1 was identified with homologues of a map kinase (STE20), a pheromone receptor gene (STE3), and pheromone precursor genes (RHA1, RHA2). Another MAT locus containing the homeodomain transcription factors HD1 and a remnant of HD2 were identified on Scaffold 7 of JGTA-S1. It was difficult to conclude if Scaffolds 7 and 13 were part of the same chromosome or were unlinked. These loci were at least 500 kb apart. The large distance between the pheromone-related locus and the HD locus in JGTA-S1 was similar to Mixia osmundae35 and Sporidiobolus salmonicolor.63 This mating system, therefore, could be bipolar, tetrapolar or pseudobipolar. No polymorphisms of STE3 and STE20 genes were found between the R. mucilaginosa genomes, suggesting either, (i) JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1 belonged to the same mating type and the opposite mating type is yet to be reported, (ii) JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1 were homothallic and were able to mate with single individual, or that (iii) JGTA-S1 and C2.5t1 were clonal members of an asexually reproducing population. Comparison of synteny in the MAT locus showed good agreement among JGTA-S1, C2.5t, and JG1b (Fig. 8). Sexual life cycle and transition from yeast to filament form are tightly linked phenomena in many dimorphic fungi. Filament formation occurs after mating of complementary cells of opposite mating types leading to the formation of dikaryotic mycelium in R. toruloides.8 However, no filamentous growth or sexual lifecycle was ever reported in Rhodotorula yeasts leading to the segregation of the Rhodotorula genus from the sexually reproducing Rhodosporidium. Although could not be demonstrated, a possible filamentous stage was also predicted for R. graminis WP1.41 Presence of a complete set of MAT genes in JGTA-S1 may predict the presence of a filamentous stage similarly, either by the conjugation of yet unidentified complementary mating types or alternatively, from germinating asexual spores as described in Zygomycetes.

JGTA-S1 contain a truncated nitrogen metabolic pathwayNitrogen is taken up by fungi in its organic form as amino acids and in its inorganic form as nitrate and ammonium. Nitrate is assimilated into ammonium by the nitrate assimilation pathway that consists of a nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, and nitrate transporters belonging to Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). Several rust fungi that are obligate biotrophs such as Melampsora and Puccinia have lost this pathway.64 We found an incomplete nitrate assimilation pathway in JGTA-S1, C2.5t1, and JG1b that was missing nitrite reductase and the MFS nitrate transporters. On the other hand, NP11 and WP1 had an intact nitrate assimilation pathway. This could partly be circumvented in JGTA-S1 by the uptake of ammonium by the two ammonium transporter proteins (g2114.t1 and g5165.t1). One of these, g5165.t1 was an orthologue of a high-affinity ammonium transporter from U. maydis that can induce filament formation in low ammonium conditions.65 JGTA-S1 also encoded glutamate synthase (g5248.t1) and glutamine synthetase (g5571.t1) the key enzymes involved in ammonia assimilation. In addition, nine amino acid transporters were encoded by JGTA-S1. Rhodotorula yeasts have the ability to utilize urea as a sole N-source with a potential to improve urea utilization of plants. This property was confirmed by the genome of JGTA-S1 that encoded urea degrading enzymes and urea transporters (g4941.t1 and g5832.t1).3.11. R. mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 may contain endosymbiotic bacteriaAnother way in which JGTA-S1 could circumvent the absence of the complete nitrate assimilation pathway is by association with N-fixing bacteria. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 was able to grow in N-free media (Fig. 9b). Growth in N-deprived media had earlier been reported in U. maydis where an association with an N-fixing bacterium living as an endosymbiont was assumed to supply N to the host.66 At least four dinitrogen reductase sequences corresponding to diazotrophs were amplified from JGTA-S1 genomic DNA (MG566093–MG566096). To search for bacteria in the genomic data the Illumina reads were mapped to the final assembly of JGTA-S1 and only the unmapped reads (1.85%) were retained to search for bacterial sequences. Several bacterial sequences could be found within the 15,047 pairs of reads. Out of these, 50 reads having over 98% identity to Pseudomonas stutzeri were found (Supplementary Table S14). The results corroborated with the finding that two nifH sequences MG566093 and MG566095 corresponding to P. stutzeri—an N-fixing as well as the denitrifying bacterium was amplified from JGTA-S1 genomic DNA. A P. stutzeri strain was experimentally confirmed to be able to colonize endosymbiotically in R. mucilaginosa (Saha et al., unpublished). Although several reads belonging to other N-fixing bacteria Klebsiella sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Mesorhizobium loti, Rhizobium sp. and Sinorhizobium sp., etc. were also found (Supplementary Table S14), no single bacterium dominated the reads prompting us to speculate (i) low diazotroph load in the genomic DNA of JGTA-S1 or (ii) the presence of several different bacteria. This observation is also supported by the low number of endosymbiotic bacteria/fungal cell (or spore) reported in S. indica and mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita, N-fixing bacteria comprising even a smaller fraction of this small number.67 For a recently sequenced genome of an obligatory Mollicutes-related endosymbiont (DhMRE) from Arbuscular mycorrhiza Dentiscutata heterogama the spores of the fungus were enriched before the endobacterial genome was isolated and sequenced.68 A protocol that enriched the DhMRE sequence and removed mycorrhizal DNA was developed for this purpose. We did not opt for any such enrichment procedures which might explain why the bacterial sequence counts of P. stutzeri (or other diazotrophs) were low. Since the presences of the other diazotrophs were unconfirmed, P. stutzeri was given prime importance for further studies. To investigate the importance of the endosymbionts we streaked JGTA-S1 several times in presence of Tetracycline and Timentin chosen based on the sensitivity of a P. stutzeri strain (JGTA-R3) isolated in the laboratory.14 After five passages, JGTA-S1 colonies were screened for the absence of P. stutzeri specific 16SrDNA amplification. A strain (Strain 11) showing no amplification of P. stutzeri 16SrDNA from the JGTA-S1 genomic DNA in two independent PCR reactions was used for further experiments (Fig. 9a). Spotting assay was performed on TSB (complete media) and N-free media as a measure of growth or fitness of JGTA-S1 cells. In parallel, qPCR was performed where P. stutzeri 16SrDNA level was quantitated and normalized against JGTA-S1 GAPDH gene. This relative abundance reflected the number of P. stutzeri per JGTA-S1 cell. Strain 11 did not show any significant reduction in growth compared with control JGTA-S1 in spotting assay (Fig. 9b). The qPCR result indicated that the number of P. stutzeri/JGTA-S1 was lower in Strain 11 compared with control when the Strain 11 was grown on TSB media as expected (Fig. 9a and c, left panel). The results were however completely different when ammonium was used as the sole N-source. Pseudomonas stutzeri levels/JGTA-S1 cell in Strain 11 was 1.8-fold higher than control when the cells were grown in N-free media with (NH4)2SO4 (Fig. 9c, right panel). This result showed that the levels of P. stutzeri alone did not dictate the fitness of JGTA-S1, especially on N-free media. This was not surprising since JGTA-S1 appeared to contain diazotrophs other than P. stutzeri underlining the possibility that the other diazotrophic endobacteria compensated for the loss of P. stutzeri (Supplementary Table S14 and Fig. 9d). The relative levels of P. stutzeri/JGTA-S1 in Strain 11 showed an increase compared with JGTA-S1 control cells when ammonium was the sole N-source compared with when it was grown in complete media. This indicated that (i) yeast growth in spotting assay and the number of P. stutzeri/JGTA-S1 cells did not always correlate and there was a more complex interplay (ii) The number of P. stutzeri/JGTA-S1 in Strain 11 depended on whether N was available in organic plus inorganic forms (TSB) or just as inorganic form (ammonium) indicating a possible correlation between P. stutzeri levels/yeast cell and N-nutrition of JGTA-S1. Endobacteria were found to be capable of multiplying within mycorrhiza at different stages of the fungal development.67 Whether this relative increase in P. stutzeri/JGTA-S1 was a consequence of multiplication of P. stutzeri within JGTA-S1 in response to inadequate N-availability is an interesting proposition to study in future. However, a JGTA-S1 strain (Strain 11.2) derived from Strain 11 grown in TSB media contained endobacteria despite treatment with five different antibiotics Timentin, Tetracycline, Carbenicillin, Gentamycin, and Kanamycin. A primer pair targeted to amplify the V3 region of bacterial 16SrDNA gene was used with JGTA-S1 and Strain 11.2 genomic DNA as a template for showing the total endobacteria (Fig. 9d, upper panel). Strain 11.2 was grown in presence of ammonium as sole N-source in presence Carbenicillin, Gentamycin, and Kanamycin as it failed to grow in presence of all five antibiotics. Strain 11.2 was then spotted on N-free media or the genomic DNA was used for qPCR to measure P. stutzeri levels/JGTA-S1 cell as before. Strain 11.2, however, had a significant fitness cost unlike Strain 11 (Fig. 9e, left panel) in spotting assay probably due to the removal of additional diazotrophs. Despite that, the P. stutzeri levels/JGTA-S1 cell was increased in Strain 11.2 under the N-inadequate condition, that too, even strongly than Strain 11 further confirming that this increase was a surveillance strategy which was not to be correlated with JGTA-S1 fitness especially under N-inadequate condition. The results can be explained by the fact that endobacteria numbers/fungal cell or spore reported for S. indica (2–20/fungal cell) and Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum (10/spore) are tightly regulated.67 In Rhodotorula, despite being a survival strategy increase of P. stutzeri levels/JGTA-S1 cell beyond a point may adversely affect the fitness of the fungus. JGTA-S1 cells had reduced growth when the endobacteria were removed. JGTA-S1 cells were streaked in presence of Timentin and Tetracycline to kill the endosymbiotic P. stutzeri within JGTA-S1 cells. Single colonies were grown in TSB after five rounds of streaking in presence of antibiotics, genomic DNA was isolated and PCR performed using P. stutzeri specific 16SrDNA primers to isolate strains deficient in P.stutzeri.

ConclusionOur results, therefore, provide a genomic perspective into the lifecycle of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 shedding some light into its ability to invade and improve plant growth and nutrition. The effect of JGTA-S1 on the plant phosphate nutrition, hormonal response, and defence was clear from relevant genes present in the JGTA-S1 genome. JGTA-S1 had a truncated N-assimilation pathway but was still able to grow in absence of nitrogen. This was potentially due to its ability to maintain diazotrophs inside the yeast. These endobacteria could not be cured and their levels/yeast cells were under complex regulation depending on the N-regime under which the yeast was grown. Comparative analyses of various endophytic and pathogens fungi within Basidiomycota showed that although the Rhodotorulas were evolutionarily closer to the hemibiotrophs M. intermedium and M. lychnidis-dioicae they shared some genes required for host invasion exclusively with other endophytes.We would like to thank Mathu Malar Chandrababunaidu for helpful discussions.

IntroductionAdvances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled culture independent studies of diverse microbial communities (microbiome) inhabiting different environments. Targeted amplicon sequencing of phylogenetic markers genes (e.g. the bacterial 16S rRNA) forms the basis of most of these studies. The downstream steps of taxonomic classification involve a similarity search of the sequenced DNA fragments (reads) against a reference database of pre-classified sequences (with taxonomic annotations).1–4 Inspite of extensive sampling of microbiomes from different environments being performed over the past decade, it would be optimistic to claim the completeness of current generation reference databases, with respect to cataloguing (and annotating) the entire diversity of the microbial world. Given this, many of the sequenced reads in a microbiome study may not find close matches in the reference databases, and thereby remain as unclassified. OTU (operational taxonomic unit)-based methods constitute an alternate approach, wherein the sequenced reads are clustered based on some predefined similarity threshold (de novo OTU clustering). Sequences clustered into the same OTU may be inferred to have originated from the same taxonomic group. Given that all sequenced reads can be grouped into OTUs prior to analysis, the problem with unclassified sequences can be traversed using this method. Further, taxonomic affiliations of these OTUs (and sequences clustered therein) can still be ascertained using similarity searches against reference databases. In practice, ‘open-reference OTU-picking’ approaches have been the choice of a number of recent studies.5–10 Such an approach involves an initial similarity search step against a reference database (of pre-clustered OTUs) for identifying sequences corresponding to previously annotated OTUs, followed by a clustering step with the remaining sequenced reads for identifying de novo OTUs.Conventional OTU-picking approaches also have certain limitations. Previous studies have indicated how DNA sequencing errors can lead to an increased number of detected OTUs,11–13 or how the use of different clustering approaches may result in formation of alternate OTU clusters.14–17 However, some other important limitations of the OTU-based approaches, especially in the context of high-throughput DNA-sequencing technologies, have received relatively lesser attention. Given the limitations pertaining to the length of contiguous stretch of DNA (read length) that can be sequenced by currently available technologies, the targeted amplicon often consists of a selected region from the phylogenetic marker gene, instead of the entire gene. For example, in case of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, stretches consisting of one or more specific ‘variable’ regions (spanning around 400–600 bp) are targeted for sequencing. However, since the reference databases catalogue sequences of full length marker genes, querying the same with ‘short’ sequence reads for OTU identification or taxonomic classification can yield suboptimal results.18 Furthermore, it may be noted that rate of evolution (accumulation of mutations) is not always uniform across the length of a chosen marker gene (or in its variable regions) across different taxonomic clades.19,20 It is possible that while a short region may remain more or less identical during the course of evolution, the flanking regions may be more prone to mutations. Alternately, barring a small hyper-variable stretch, a major fraction of the marker gene may remain unchanged through evolution. Given this scenario, OTU clustering results can vary significantly based on the choice of the target region. Although OTUs identified or classified using reference-based methods vs de novo clustering methods can provide different results, any comparison between the results obtained from studies utilizing different variable regions of a given marker gene also loses relevance.The question whether the above limitations can be addressed using reference OTU databases that are specific to the targeted regions of the marker gene has been explored in this study. We present the OTUX (meta)database, which consists of 19 distinct OTU databases corresponding to the different stretches of variable regions (V-regions) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, that are commonly targeted for amplicon sequencing in microbiome studies. Each of the V-region-specific databases consists of OTUs (referred to as OTUX-OTUs) identified by clustering sequence fragments from corresponding stretches of V-regions cropped out from full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences catalogued in reference databases. Also presented is a ‘mapping matrix’ (MAPMAT), which lists the probabilities of association of any of the OTUX-OTUs to the reference OTUs present in the widely used Greengenes OTU database (consisting full-length marker genes). An open-reference-based OTU-picking approach against an appropriately selected OTUX V-region database is expected to provide results closer to those obtained with de novo OTU clustering. Further, the OTU abundance profiles, obtained in terms of OTUX-OTUs, can be ‘mapped back’ and represented in terms of Greengenes OTUs, using the MAPMAT. Mapping back enables comparing OTU-picking or taxonomic annotation results from different microbiome studies, even if the choice of targeted V-regions had been different. The utility of the proposed database and OTU-picking approach has been extensively validated with multiple simulated sequence datasets mimicking microbiome samples collected from diverse environments. The results indicate the benefits of using V-region-specific databases for classifying 16S amplicon data generated using short-read sequencing technologies.2. Materials and methodsThe OTUX workflow has two major components. This includes a one-time preprocessing step to generate customized V-region-specific reference databases (called OTUX databases) and a ‘MAPMAT’ for different stretches of V-regions. Subsequently, any amplicon sequencing dataset targeting 16S V-regions can be subjected to a reference-based OTU-picking cum taxonomic classification step using the OTUX reference database(s). Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of the OTUX method in context of conventional approach (CA) of OTU picking and taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing reads. A schematic representation of the OTUX method in context of CA of OTU picking and taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing reads.

The utility of the ‘MAPMAT’ in enabling comparison of taxonomic profiles obtained using different V-regions is also depicted.2.1. Building OTUX databasesThe ‘prokMSA’ unaligned sequences from Greengenes database21 was downloaded through the following links: (i) http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/Sequence_Data/Fasta_data_files/current_prokMSA _unaligned.fasta.gz and (ii) ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_5/gg_13_5.fasta.gz. The downloaded files were decompressed to obtain the fasta formatted sequences, which were subsequently combined to create a final corpus of 1,079,252 unaligned sequences. The taxonomic classification of these sequences for different taxonomic hierarchical levels (including phylum, class, order, family, genus, species as well as Greengenes OTU IDs at 99% sequence identity) as annotated in Greengenes database version 13.8, were retrieved from ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_8_otus/taxonomy/99_otu_taxonomy.txt. Individual V-regions as well as stretches encompassing consecutive V-regions were extracted from each of the 16S rRNA gene sequences present in the sequence corpus using the software V-xtractor.22 The extracted sequences were then clustered based on sequence similarity using CD-HIT,23 wherein each resultant cluster constituted sequences sharing 99% sequence identity. Each of the clusters was assigned a V-region-specific OTU identifier (OTUXV ID) and was compiled to constitute an OTUXV reference database corresponding to a specific V-region.2.2. Building MAPMATAn example is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, where an OTUX ID OTUXVi is mapped to corresponding Greengenes OTUX IDs. The percentages mentioned represent the propensities of OTUX ID OTUXVi to be associated to any of the hypothetical Greengenes OTU IDs GGx, GGy and GGz.2.3. Creating validation datasetsAssessment of accuracy of taxonomic annotation of any OTU-picking or taxonomic classification method, on a real metagenomic dataset constituting short reads, poses a challenge since the origin (taxonomic affiliation) of the sequenced reads are ‘unknown’. The annotation results predicted by different available methods may vary from each other, with respect to the assigned lineage as well as depth of assignment, and cannot be used as a benchmark/standard for comparison. To overcome this problem, multiple validation sets of simulated short metagenomic reads were created and were classified into OTUs using our method. The simulated metagenomes pertaining to 4 different environments, viz. gut of healthy children (abbreviated as GUT),24 healthy human skin (abbreviated as SKIN),25 Mediterranean sea (abbreviated as SEA)26 and soil (SOIL),27 were generated using the following procedure. Publicly available datasets corresponding to metagenomic samples from the above mentioned environments were retrieved (Supplementary Table S1) and overall proportions of different genera present in each of the environments were obtained from the provided abundance tables (Supplementary Material S2). To create a simulated metagenome pertaining to an environment, full length 16S rRNA genes were randomly drawn from the RDP database (v10.3),28 ensuring that the proportions of the picked genera were similar to those present in the chosen environment (only top 50 genera in each environment considered). The sequences were drawn in the following manner. Let it be assumed that there are ‘N’ full-length sequences belonging to genus ‘X’ (which may belong to different species/strains of the same genus) in the RDP database. Further, let it be considered that in a simulated metagenome (of a pre-defined size or total number of sequences) pertaining to a specific environment, the genus ‘X’ needs to be represented with ‘i’ number of sequences. To achieve this, ‘i’ random sequences from the set of ‘N’ sequences (belonging to genus ‘X’) were picked with replacement. The process was repeated for every genus constituting the desired simulated metagenome. 100 simulated metagenomic datasets (each constituting 10,000 sequences) were created for each of the four environments (abbreviated as DGUT/F, DSKIN/F, DSEA/F and DSOIL/F). Specific V-regions or selected stretches of V-regions from each of the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (constituting these simulated metagenomes) were further cropped out to create corresponding simulated ‘short-read’ metagenomic datasets (abbreviated as DGUT/Vi, DSKIN/Vi, DSEA/Vi and DSOIL/Vi), mimicking targeted amplicon sequencing. The selected V-regions (and stretches of V-regions) considered for validation included V4, V1-V2, V1-V3, V2-V3, V3-V4, V3-V5, V3-V6, V4-V5, V4-V6, V5-V6 and V6-V8, which are typically employed in 16S rRNA-based microbiome studies.2.4. Classifying and annotating metagenomic sequencesReference-based OTU-picking can be performed for a query set of metagenomic sequences using an OTUXVi reference database (wherein ‘i’ corresponds to the V-region or stretch of consecutive V-regions which were targeted during amplicon sequencing). For the purpose of validation, OTU-picking or taxonomic assignment exercise was performed with multiple simulated metagenomic datasets as well as using different OTUXVi reference databases (as appropriate for the individual datasets). The following section illustrates this process of annotation for a set of simulated query sequences corresponding to an amplicon sequencing experiment targeting the V4 region, using OTUXV4 as the reference database. The same methods can be extended for classifying sequences generated in sequencing experiments targeting a different V-region, by choosing an appropriate OTUXVi reference database. In this work, a naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang’s algorithm),4 as implemented in the software ‘mothur’,29 was used for classification, wherein a bootstrap confidence threshold of 80% was used for making assignments at the OTU level. Subsequently, an OTU abundance profile (TOTUX) was generated by cumulating the total number of sequenced reads from the given metagenomic sample that could be attributed to each of the OTUXV4 OTUs. It may be noted here that the choice of the naïve Bayesian classifier for the validation study was influenced by its wide use in microbiome studies and annotation tools (e.g. RDP classifier).4 Other reference-based OTU-picking and taxonomic classification methods can also be used while using OTUX as a reference database. The classification results (obtained in terms of OTUXV4 OTUs) were mapped back using the corresponding MAPMATV4 to represent the results in terms of Greengenes (v13.8 – OTUs obtained at 99% identity) OTU IDs. This ‘mapping back’ can be performed using either a ‘one-to-one mapping’ (one OTX OTU mapped back to a single Greengenes OTU) approach or a ‘one-to-many mapping’ (one OTX OTU mapped back to multiple Greengenes OTUs) approach. These mapping back approaches are described below.In this procedure, each query sequence is assigned to one particular Greengenes OTU ID. For example, if a particular query sequence ‘s’ has been assigned to the OTU ‘x’ corresponding to the reference database OTUXV4 (abbreviated as OTUXV4x), the MAPMATV4 elements {MAPMATV4xj} are retrieved (wherein ‘j’ = 1 <U+2192> NGG i.e. the total no. of Greengenes OTUs). The maximum value of {MAPMATV4xj} is then computed. The sequence ‘s’ can subsequently be classified to the Greengenes OTU ‘y’ (abbreviated as GGy), wherein MAPMATV4xy = max{MAPMATV4xj}. In effect, the OTUX ID OTUXV4x is mapped to the Greengenes ID GGy since they have the highest propensity of association as recorded in the MAPMAT. The process, once repeated for all query sequences will subsequently lead to a new OTU abundance profile (TGG), represented in terms of Greengenes OTU IDs.As mentioned earlier, the current version of OTUX approach has been modelled around the Greengenes database and designed to pick OTUs at the most stringent threshold suggested by Greengenes (i.e. 99% identity). The choice of threshold was guided by the rationale that OTUs picked based on a more stringent identity threshold (e.g. 99%) can later be merged together to make larger OTU clusters corresponding to a lower threshold (e.g. 97%). Further, it has also been reported that stringent average nucleotide identity cut-off of >99% might be required to delineate a new species.30 Although clustering at 97% identity threshold would generate lesser number of clusters and make the data more amenable for analysis, a higher threshold of 99% is expected to be more suitable for accurate identification of strains and ecotypes. However, given that some studies may also prefer lower identity thresholds (e.g. 97%) for OTU clustering, the implementation of OTUX approach (available at https://web.rniapps.net/otux/) provides option to map back OTUX OTUs (originally picked at 99% identity threshold) to Greengenes OTU IDs corresponding to OTUs clustered at identity thresholds of 99% as well as 97%.2.5. Classifying simulated metagenomic sequences (validation datasets)The full length sequences belonging to each of the simulated metagenomic datasets (DGUT/F, DSKIN/F, DSEA/F and DSOIL/F) were first subjected to ‘OTU picking’ (taxonomic classification at the OTU level) against the Greengenes database (v13.8—ftp://greengenes.microbio.me/greengenes_release/gg_13_8_otus/rep_set/99_otus.fasta) using the naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang’s algorithm) as implemented in the software ‘mothur’ (with a bootstrap confidence threshold of 80%). Given that full-length 16S sequences were compared against a full-length 16S rRNA sequence database, the results obtained using the above procedure reflects the best achievable OTU-classification using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (using the given algorithm) and was considered as a ‘benchmark’ or the ‘gold standard’ (abbreviated as GS) of taxonomic classification for our validation study.The simulated ‘short-read’ metagenomic sequences in the validation datasets were subsequently subjected to taxonomic classification using the following three methods. For ease of explanation, examples corresponding to the simulated metagenomic datasets pertaining to V4 region (DGUT/V4, DSKIN/V4, DSEA/V4 and DSOIL/V4) have been used in the following sections. The same methods have been followed for validation using other simulated metagenomic datasets.Sequences present in each of the simulated metagenomes belonging to the sets DGUT/V4, DSKIN/V4, DSEA/V4 and DSOIL/V4 were classified using the naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang’s algorithm as implemented in the software ‘mothur’ with a bootstrap confidence threshold of 80%), considering the Greengenes OTU database as a reference (similar approach as GS). These results represent taxonomic classification that can be obtained using the CA of OTU-picking or taxonomic classification wherein short-read sequences (encompassing a certain region of a marker gene) are used as a query against a OTU database constituted of full length marker gene sequences. For ease of comparison, abundance profiles (as per Greengenes taxonomy) representing the proportion of OTUs (and other taxonomic hierarchical levels), both in terms of raw sequence counts as well as percentage normalized abundance, were generated.Metagenomic sequences belonging to each of the validation sets (DGUT/V4, DSKIN/V4, DSEA/V4 and DSOIL/V4) were clustered de novo at 99% identity using the software CROP,31 wherein each cluster represents a OTU. Subsequently, in order to obtain taxonomic classification of the respective clusters/OTUs, the representative sequences from each of the clusters were classified using the Greengenes OTU database as a reference. The taxonomic profile TCR reports abundance of OTUs generated using CROP, wherein abundance of each OTU is equivalent to its cluster size.Metagenomic sequences belonging to each of the validation sets (DGUT/V4, DSKIN/V4, DSEA/V4 and DSOIL/V4) were also classified using the naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang’s algorithm as implemented in the software mother with a bootstrap confidence threshold of 80%), using the OTUXV4 database as a reference. These results represent the taxonomic classification that can be obtained using the novel OTUX approach of OTU-picking and taxonomic classification wherein short-read sequences (covering a certain region of a marker gene) are used as query against a pre-computed OTU database corresponding to a specific hypervariable region (V4 in this case). It may be noted that the obtained OTU abundance profile (TOTUX) reports the results in terms of OTUXV4 OTU IDs. For ease of comparison, these results are also mapped back in terms of Greengenes OTU IDs and are provided in form of OTU abundance profile TGG (using one-to-one mapping approach), wherein raw counts of sequences assigned to individual Greengenes OTUs are depicted. Furthermore, percentage normalized abundance profile(s) TGG% (using one-to-many mapping approach) are also generated, wherein abundance/proportion of OTUs (and/or other taxa) is represented in percent normalized terms.2.6. Validation testsThe correctness of taxonomic assignments obtained with OTUX and CA approaches were assessed by comparing them against the benchmark/‘GS’, which corresponds to OTU assignments obtained using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences searched against the Greengenes reference database. The comparison was based on the following parameters. First, the accuracy of taxonomic assignments by CA and OTUX at OTU, Genus, and Family level(s) were assessed in terms of correct number of assignments (with reference to GS results). During this assessment, one-to-one mapping of OTUX IDs to Greengenes IDs had been used. Subsequently, a t-test was performed to assess the performance of OTUX with respect to CA (based on results of 100 simulated metagenomic datasets). The approaches were also compared on the basis of computational time required for classification.To evaluate the overall accuracy as well as coherence of taxonomic assignments obtained using different V-regions and methods, the widely used Unifrac distance metric was chosen.32 Unifrac is a dissimilarity measure which considers phylogenetic information of constituent microbes while comparing microbiome samples, thereby allowing assessment of overall accuracy considering all taxonomic hierarchical levels. Pairwise weighted Unifrac distances were calculated between percentage normalized abundance tables generated by GS, OTUX, CA and CR. In case of OTUX, CA and CR, taxonomic profiles obtained using all relevant V-regions or stretches of V-regions were considered. For this assessment, percentage normalized OTUX abundance profiles (TGG%) were generated using one-to-many mapping approach between OTUX IDs and Greengenes IDs. Dendograms were constructed from the pairwise Unifrac distances (averaged for 100 simulated metagenomic datasets) using UPGMA clustering, as implemented in the programme ‘Neighbor’ included in the Phylip package,33 considering GS as an outgroup. This process was repeated for the simulated metagenomes corresponding to all four selected environments (DGUT, DSKIN, DSEA and DSOIL). Different diversity measures for the taxonomic profiles obtained with GS, OTUX, CA and CR approaches, viz. Shannon diversity, Simpson index (evenness), Chao1 index (species richness) and number of observed species, were also computed for the DGUT environment, using the R Phyloseq package.343. Results and discussion3.1. OTUX approach provides higher proportion of correct taxonomic classificationsTable 1 provides a comparison of taxonomic classification accuracy of the proposed OTUX approach, with respect to CA, while classifying different simulated microbiome datasets. As mentioned earlier, CA involves reference-based OTU picking from a query set of short 16S rRNA gene reads using an OTU database consisting of full length 16S rRNA gene sequences. In this study, Greengenes version 13.8, containing OTUs clustered at 99% sequence identity, was used as the reference database for CA. In contrast, OTUX approach involves reference-based OTU picking of the same short reads using an appropriate OTUX V-region database (consisting sequences clustered with 99% identity). OTUs identified using OTUX approach, initially classified in terms of OTUX database identifiers (OTUX IDs), was ‘mapped back’ to be represented in terms of Greengenes IDs (see Materials and methods), so as to enable comparison against CA. Results obtained with both CA and OTUX approaches were evaluated with reference to a ‘GS’, which corresponded to the reference-based OTU-picking results (in terms of Greengenes IDs) that could be obtained using full length 16S rRNA gene amplicons instead of short-read sequences (see Materials and methods). In terms of number of sequences correctly assigned at the OTU level, OTUX approach significantly (P < 0.001) outperforms CA in almost all cases, irrespective of the type of microbiome sample or the targeted V-region (Table 1). Barring a couple of occasions, OTUX is observed to consistently assign over 50% of the query reads to appropriate OTUs, with accuracies reaching as high as 70% in some cases. More than often, OTUX could correctly assign almost double the number of reads compared with CA. CA provides better result than OTUX only in a single instance, wherein infant gut microbiome (GUT) samples were probed using V1–V3 region. In addition to the number of correct OTU assignments, the results of OTUX were also evaluated in terms of overall correctness of the obtained taxonomic profiles for the simulated microbiome samples considering different levels of taxonomic hierarchy (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2A and B; Supplementary Material S3). Weighted-UniFrac distances between the taxonomic abundance profiles obtained using OTUX (see Materials and methods) and those obtained using GS (using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences) were computed for this purpose. For comparison, distances between taxonomic profiles obtained using CA and GS were also calculated. Echoing earlier results, taxonomic abundance profiles obtained with OTUX are found to be more similar to the GS taxonomic profiles as compared with the profiles obtained with CA, in almost all cases. The only exceptions pertain to the profiles generated for the infant gut (GUT) microbiome corresponding to experiments targeting the V1–V2 and V1–V3 regions. In summary, OTUX approach appears to be a more reliable method for reference-based OTU picking, providing greater accuracy in taxonomic classification than existing CAs utilizing full-length 16S rRNA sequence databases.Taxonomic classification results obtained with the proposed OTUX approach and CAPerformance of both the approaches have been evaluated with multiple simulated microbiome datasets mimicking different types of environmental samples, (viz., infant gut, skin, sea and soil), and amplicon sequencing experiments targeting different V-regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.

Only number of average correct assignments and wrong assignments has been depicted. The remaining reads (out of 10,000) could not be classified at OTU level.Weighted UNIFRAC distance of taxonomic abundance profile from actual taxonomic diversity (GS: gold-standard).As mentioned earlier, one of the major reasons behind incorrect taxonomic assignment of short-read sequences to a different taxonomic lineage pertain to un-even evolutionary rate along the length of the 16S rRNA gene. The ‘mapping matrices’ introduced in the OTUX approach (see Building MAPMAT section) probably address this issue to some extent. Although in case of CA, finding high level of similarity of a very short stretch of sequence against a Greengenes (GG) OTU might result in a direct attribution of the short sequence to the lineage of the given GG OTU, the OTUX approach acknowledges that such a short semi-identical stretch could have alternate origins. The ‘mapping matrices’ presented in this work captures the propensities of association of such semi-identical short stretches of sequences (which have been clustered to form OTUX OTUs), to multiple GG OTUs/taxonomic lineages. It is based on these propensities that the final taxonomic abundance tables (according to GG lineages) are generated in the OTUX approach. Although this method (of propensity-based assignments) may also lead to incorrect assignments in some cases, overall the validation results indicate better performance of the OTUX approach compared with the direct assignments obtained with CA.To evaluate whether the relatively better performance of OTUX spanned all the taxonomic lineages, or were limited to certain specific clades, the proportions of correct and incorrect assignments by OTUX and CA, cumulated at genus and family levels were analysed (Supplementary Material S4). Neither OTUX nor CA could provide unbiased performance for all the taxonomic lineages while using different V-regions/stretches of V-regions. However, it was observed that in most cases the proportions of correct assignments by OTUX (averaged over all families or genera) were higher compared with CA. Further, the standard deviations in proportions of correct assignments across families/genera were also observed to be mostly equivalent or slightly lower for OTUX, reiterating the utility of the newly proposed taxonomic classification approach.3.2. OTU clusters identified by OTUX are similar to those obtained using de novo OTU-picking approachGiven the observed improvements in reference-based OTU-picking and taxonomic classification achieved using OTUX, it was imperative to check how close are these results to those obtained using any sequence similarity based de novo OTU clustering method. Figure 2 depicts a comparison of OTU picking results obtained using CROP (CR), a popular de novo OTU clustering method, with those obtained using OTUX and CA. Since the three compared methods do not generate any common identifier(s) for the different OTU clusters obtained, ‘Jaccard similarity’ was computed to check the similarities between clusters generated by different methods (see Materials and methods). Similar clusters would share a greater proportion of query sequences, thereby resulting in a higher Jaccard similarity. Although comparing between OTUX and CR clusters, 100 largest clusters (in terms of number of query sequences in each cluster) generated by both the methods were selected, and pairwise Jaccard similarities were computed. For each of the 100 OTUX clusters, most similar CR clusters were identified based on Jaccard similarity. Similarly, for each of the 100 CR clusters, most similar OTUX clusters were also identified using reciprocal searches. Average Jaccard similarity values corresponding to these 2 × 100 closest pairs of clusters were considered as a measure of overall similarity in OTU clustering obtained using the two methods. Further, the number of reciprocal best hits between OTUX and CR clusters was also used as an indicator to evaluate the similarity between clustering results. Similarity between OTU clustering by CA and CR was also evaluated in a similar manner. As evident from Fig. 2, the results obtained using OTUX are relatively more similar to CR results when compared with results obtained with CA. The results of OTUX and CR are observed to be around 1.2–1.7 times more similar to each other in terms of average Jaccard similarity as compared with the similarity between CA and CR approaches. Even in terms of number of reciprocal best hits identified between the sets of clusters, OTUX and CR are more closely associated. Similar results were observed on extending the comparison for the top 300 and 500 (most populous) clusters generated for the simulated gut microbiome dataset with de novo clustering (CROP) thresholds set at 99, 97 and 95% (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results assume further significance when viewed in context of execution time. It is expected that both CA and OTUX, being reference-based OTU-picking approaches, would have quicker execution time when compared with de novo OTU clustering approaches.10 Comparison of execution times between OTUX and CA revealed an overall equivalent performance for both approaches, with minor variations depending on the targeted V-region (Supplementary Table S3A and B). A reasonable execution time coupled to a clustering solution closer to a de novo approach, as well as simultaneously improving on accuracy of taxonomic classification, certainly provides OTUX approach an edge over the conventional reference-based OTU picking. Similarity of OTU clusters obtained using OTUX and CA when compared with de novo OTU clusters obtained using CROP (CR) for different simulated microbiome datasets pertaining to (A) GUT, (B) SKIN, (C) SEA and (D) SOIL. The bars indicate average Jaccard similarity (in terms of query sequence reads) between 100 largest clusters identified by the compared methods (see Materials and methods). The number mentioned above each bar represents the percentage of reciprocal best hits identified between the 100 largest clusters identified by compared methods (see Materials and methods).Similarity of OTU clusters obtained using OTUX and CA when compared with de novo OTU clusters obtained using CROP (CR) for different simulated microbiome datasets pertaining to (A) GUT, (B) SKIN, (C) SEA and (D) SOIL.

OTUX approach results obtained using different V-regions are coherent and better descriptors of taxonomic diversityDespite the promising results mentioned above, utilizing OTUX for a cross-study comparison of microbiome datasets (targeting different V-regions) only finds relevance if OTUX results obtained with different V-regions are coherent. Figure 3 depicts four dendograms, wherein the taxonomic profiles corresponding to the simulated microbiome datasets obtained with OTUX, CA and CR, have been clustered based on pair wise weighted UniFrac distances (UPGMA method). Nodes in the tree correspond to the results obtained when different V-regions were targeted. Although OTUs identified using OTUX approach were mapped back to be represented in terms of Greengenes IDs and taxonomy, the cluster representatives of each of the OTUs generated using CR were also annotated in terms of Greengenes taxonomy to enable comparison with CA approach (see Materials and methods). The ‘GS’ result was used as an ‘outgroup’ during clustering. The clustering patterns in Fig. 3 indicate that results obtained using the same method (either of OTUX, CA or CR) group together irrespective of the targeted V-region. Although this observation assures of a certain level of coherence between results obtained using any given method, the proximity of the OTUX results cluster to the GS result is worth noting. Not only are the results obtained using OTUX approach coherent, but they are also consistently better representatives of the taxonomic diversity of the sampled environment, irrespective of the targeted V-region. In addition to the comparison based on weighted UniFrac distances, different diversity measures, like Shannon diversity, Simpson index (evenness), Chao1 index (species richness) and number of observed OTUs pertaining to the simulated gut microbiome, were computed based on the OTUs identified using CA, CR and OTUX approaches (Supplementary Table S4). These results were also compared in context of the diversity values corresponding to the GS taxonomic profiles. For most of the regions, diversity values obtained with OTUX were closer to the GS diversity values, when compared with CA and CROP methods. Dendograms depicting similarity between taxonomic profiles obtained with different OTU classification methods (viz. GS, CA, CR and OTUX) while using different V-regions. The trees have been constructed using the UPGMA method while using weighted UniFrac as the distance measure and considering the taxonomic profile generated with GS as an outgroup. Dendograms corresponding to simulated microbiomes pertaining to the environments (A) GUT, (B) SKIN, (C) SEA and (D) SOIL, have been plotted.Dendograms depicting similarity between taxonomic profiles obtained with different OTU classification methods (viz.

Dendograms corresponding to simulated microbiomes pertaining to the environments (A) GUT, (B) SKIN, (C) SEA and (D) SOIL, have been plotted.It is however important to note here that certain other biologically important differences and methodological biases (in addition to those resulting from the choice of V-regions) may be inherent to sequenced data from different studies and protocols. The possible effects of these potential biases, on the robustness of taxonomic assignments obtained with CA and OTUX was tested using real microbiome sampling data from an earlier study.35 Microbiomes pertaining to six different environments had been sampled in the earlier study, wherein the DNA sequencing for each of the samples were done on both Illumina (MiSeq 2 × 250 bp paired end protocol) and Roche 454 (GS FLX using Titanium) platforms. Taxonomic assignments for both the Illumina as well as Roche generated datasets from this study were performed with OTUX and CA, followed by a comparison of the similarity of the taxonomic profiles generated based on weighted Unifrac distances. Taxonomic profiles generated from Illumina and Roche datasets using OTUX method were observed to be more similar to each other than those generated by CA, in case of four (out of six) of the sampled environments (Supplementary Table S5). It may be noted here that the study specific biases pertaining to sequencing chemistry, sample storage/handling and other methodological differences, cannot be expected to be completely overcome by using in silico taxonomic classification methods such as OTUX or other CAs. However, given that the results indicate at OTUX’s ability to arrive at more coherent taxonomic profiles when compared with the CA, OTUX is expected to have better utility while performing cross-study taxonomic comparisons.4. ConclusionIn summary, adopting OTUX approach of OTU picking can enable easy and accurate cross-study comparison of taxonomic profiles, even when targeted V-regions might vary across different studies. Although performing such comparisons at a large scale (with several microbiome datasets) using de novo OTU clustering approach might be computationally prohibitive, using CA like approaches might connote a compromise in accuracy of the comparison. In contrast, such comparisons using OTUX approach not only provides more accurate taxonomic annotations (even at the OTU level), but also attains the same with lesser computational expenses.AvailabilityFreely available for academic use on the web at https://web.rniapps.net/otux/All three authors are employees of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.

IntroductionThe occurrence of reading frameshifts in a gene is a very serious mutation, and it results in the creation of mutant proteins.1 This may result in various hereditary2–4 or oncological diseases.5 The occurrence of reading frameshifts in a gene is caused by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which is not a multiple of 3. Besides, in eukaryotic genes, reading frameshifts could arise through the shift of boundaries between exons and introns, when the splicing point is under mutation.6 In the evolution of genetic sequences, it is common to observe the insertions and deletions of small fragments.7,8 In this case, within the translation stage there is a complete change in the amino acid sequence beyond the frameshift position.9 Consequently, the encoded amino acid sequence can completely lose its biological function and become a pseudogen<U+0435>. This sequence could either acquire another biological function or its function may remain the same. The study of such mutations is important for understanding the mechanisms of protein sequence evolution.Errors of genome sequencing and assembly processes could also cause reading frameshifts in genes present in modern databases.10 For example, in pyrosequencing methods and PacBio sequencing technology, frameshift errors appear very frequently. In this case, the encoded amino acid sequence beyond the frameshift position would be incorrect, which makes further annotation difficult. To find and correct shifts for these sequencing methods, special programs have been developed.11,12 The identification of such errors is important for improving annotation and ensuring further research of new genomes.In the literature, cases of programmed ribosomal frameshifts have been reported. In this case, the ribosome itself shifts within the protein synthesis process on a single base, which results in the emergence of an alternative protein.13 However, such events are beyond the scope of this study. The present study is focused on developing a mathematical algorithm for the detection of potential reading frameshifts in protein-coding sequences (cds).The methods currently used to find reading frameshifts can be divided into two classes. The methods of the first class are based on the comparison (alignment) of sequences. These methods use protein database search to find sequences which are homologous to the sequence of interest but are devoid of the frameshift. Such methods suggest the use of the BLAST program and analogues.8,9,14 An obvious limitation of these methods is that in the absence of a homologous sequence without a frameshift, it is impossible to determine the presence of a frameshift. The large number of substitutions that occurred after the frameshift event could also make it difficult to find similarities. In order to search for remote similarities, while taking the possible frameshifts into account, special programs are being developed.15The methods of the second class are aimed at finding the frameshift directly by the sequence (ab initio).16–18 There are several methods for the prediction of protein-coding regions in genome sequences that consider the probable reading frameshifts. These methods are used by programs: FrameD,16,19 based on the Markov models, program for predicting genes by taking into account frameshifts and searching for frameshifts in known genes. The FragGeneScan program20 was created to search for coding regions in short reads taking into account the frameshifts and based on the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Also, the HMM-frame program12 uses the HMMs to search for protein domains in the metagenomics sequences while taking into consideration the probable reading frameshifts.The GeneTack program is among the most widely used tools.17,21 This program can identify reading frameshifts resulting from mutations and sequencing errors. The idea of the algorithm is that several genes are located on the chromosome one after another and are represented in databases as independent genes which may have originated from a single coding sequence separated as a result of the reading frameshift. The GeneTack algorithm is based on the HMM and the Viterbi algorithm, and possesses several parameters that require adjustment prior to sequence processing. Unfortunately, the methods are all limited because they require a training sample for determination of the HMM parameters. In the result some statistical properties of the gene could be averaged, which significantly reduces the capability of the methods. In particular, the frequencies of k-words belong to these statistical properties. Training is carried out using another program of the authors—GeneMarkS.22 The training sample is usually the entire sequence of the genome under study (for prokaryotes) or a set of coding sequences of this genome (for eukaryotes). Besides, a prepared model from the authors’ website, having a similar level of GC content, could also be used. The GC content of the sequences under examination has a significant effect on the search for reading frameshifts. The given method was designed to search for reading frameshifts both at the genome annotation stage (as part of the genome annotation integrated programs) and in known sequences.Most of the methods used for the detection of frameshifts ab initio are based on the well-known property of the cds, i.e. the triplet periodicity (TP). TP is exclusively present in the cds of virtually all organisms and is considered to be a consequence of the preferred use of synonymous codons by various organisms.23,24 This property is used by many programs designed for cds prediction.25,26 It has been shown that the reading frameshift in a gene resulted in TP phase shift in the corresponding position.18 TP phase shift is the shift of TP matrix columns relative to the positions of the bases in the codons. An example is presented in Fig. 1A and B. Figure 1A shows the TP matrix, which was constructed from the coding sequence ‘atcatcatc …’. The first column of this matrix corresponds to the first codon base, the second column corresponds to the second codon base, and the third column corresponds to the third codon base. Conditionally, this can be shown as: 1 => 1, 2 => 2, 3 => 3. Such a relationship can be called Phase 0, or Fa = 0. After inserting one base (G in the middle of the sequence, Fig. 1B), the TP phase shifts to one base. In this case, the correspondence of positions in the codons and columns of the matrix is 1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 1. This correspondence is called Phase 1 or Fa = 1. The value Fa = 2 is also possible. In this case, 1 => 3, 2 => 1, 3 => 2. Such a correspondence will be observed when inserting any two DNA bases. After inserting n DNA bases, Fa becomes n - 3int(n/3). Here, ‘int’ is the operation of computing the integer part of a number. (A) The TP matrix is shown for the sequence S={atc}50. (B) The phase TP in a fragment of the sequence S. A base g is inserted in the middle of the sequence. The phase Fa = 0 was before the insertion of g, because there is an agreement between the columns of the matrix and the positions of the codons as 1 => 1, 2 => 2, 3 => 3, respectively. Fa = 1 after the insertion of g, because the following agreement is observed: 1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 1. (C) The TP matrix for the sequence S={atcgga}25.(A) The TP matrix is shown for the sequence S={atc}50. (B) The phase TP in a fragment of the sequence S.

Fa = 1 after the insertion of g, because the following agreement is observed: 1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 1. (C) The TP matrix for the sequence S={atcgga}25.For the determination of TP phase shifts, mathematical methods such as the Fourier transform,27 wavelet transform,28 dynamic programming29 or methods based on comparison of periodicity matrices30 have been employed. The Fourier transform method produced good results on artificial sequences and genes with a high level of TP. However, the method requires a window of rather long length (the authors recommended a window size of about 750 nt).27 Methods based on dynamic programming or matrices comparison are characterized by enhanced sensitivity, but are incapable of detecting frameshifts in sequences with a low level of TP.18We developed a new approach for TP phase shift detection in cds from prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. By this method, an attempt was made to eliminate the disadvantages of the HMM approaches connected to the requirement of the HMM configuration in the sampling of genes. Such adjustment significantly averages all the characteristics of the genes TP, because different classes of TP exist in the genome, and the combination thereof decreases the statistical significance of TP.31 In addition, the use of HMM could identify reading frameshifts only in those cds possessing the same base correlations, as the training sample. If the correlations between bases of cds are different, then it could be impossible to detect the frameshifts. The HMM limitations are considered in more details in the ‘3.4. Comparison with the Genetack-GM program’ section.We developed a method that enables determination of the best TP matrix for each sequence while taking into account the correlation of the adjacent DNA bases along with the possibility of nucleotides insertion or deletion. The genetic algorithm and the dynamic programming method32 were used in a similar way, as described in our previous work on amino acid sequences. However, in the given case, the algorithm was modified by introducing a matrix that considers the correlation of neighbouring bases. After identifying such a matrix, we performed the final alignment of the sequence of interest with respect to the best matrix and found the probable reading frameshift positions.As a result of our research, we identified an unexpectedly large number of probable reading frameshifts in the Arabidopsisthaliana genome cds, which constituted 9,930 with the error level of the first and second types being ~11% and 30%. This is about 21% of all the registered cds from this genome. We obtained similar results for the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus and Xenopus tropicalis. It was assumed that the reading frameshift is a relatively frequently found mutation, and this mutation could take part in the creation of new genes and proteins.2. Mathematical methods and algorithms2.1. General description of the mathematical algorithm used in this workThe task of reading frameshift detection in a protein-coding sequence could be mathematically solved, if it becomes possible to relate the statistical properties of the sequence with the reading frame. In this case, one could find the reading frameshift in a sequence without using any kind of training and without involving any additional information. Such a property could be presented by the TP of genes.33 In this case, the reading frameshift would appear as a TP phase shift.Let us consider a protein-coding sequence S having a length N. The TP of a sequence is usually set in the form of the MT(3, 4) matrix. Here, the columns indicate the three positions of codons (1, 2 or 3), and the rows represent four types of nucleotides.33Figure 1A and C presents an example of a TP matrix created for the sequences S={atc}50 and S={atcgga}25. In the first case, only three matrix elements are filled, whereas six elements are filled in the second case. The TP of the S sequence set in the form of the MT matrix perfectly reflects the difference in base frequencies at each position of the codon from the base frequencies throughout the entire nucleotide sequence. However, the MT matrix does not consider the correlation between adjacent bases, as illustrated by the following example. Let us assume that in our sequence only four codons are equally likely to be used: ATA, TAT, CGC and GCG, and they are arranged in a sequence in some random order. Then, the DNA base frequencies in each column of the MT matrix would be equal to the frequencies of bases in the entire sequence, and the matrix constructed according to this sequence would show that there is no TP in the sequence.Therefore, it is more appropriate to use another matrix M(i, n) while searching for TP. The matrix contains 16 rows and 3 columns. The columns of the matrix represent the pairs of positions in the codon: 3-1, 1-2 and 2-3. Here, the i column of the M matrix takes the 1, 2 and 3 values for pairs of positions in codon: 3-1, 1-2 and 2-3, respectively. This means that the M matrix columns are numbered by the last position out of the two. The n row number shows the frequency of the base pairs in columns, and n takes values from 1 to 16. In order to fill the M matrix, the row number is calculated as follows: n = s(j - 1)+4(s(j) - 1). This study utilized the a = 1, t = 2, c = 3 and g = 4 nucleotides numerical coding. Here, s(j) is the base of the S sequence in the j position, which corresponds to the i position in the codon calculated with the following equation: i = j - 3int(j/3), where ‘int’ is the integer part of the number. Then, the s(j - 1) base corresponds to the previous neighbouring codon position. Thus, j ranges from 2 to N values. For each j, M(i, n) = M(i, n) + 1.Therefore, the M(3, 16) matrix contains two types of statistical regularities of the coding regions. The first one is the difference between the frequencies of nucleotides in each position of a codon and the nucleotide frequencies of the entire S sequence. The second one is the correlation of two neighbouring nucleotides positions of the codon (3-1, 1-2 and 2-3).Assuming we have a sequence S that is a cds. The sequence S0 is sequence S prior to the reading frameshifts, that is, S0 is the ancestor of sequence S. We create the matrix M(3, 16) for S and we create the matrix M0(3, 16) for S0 as described above. If one knows the M0(3, 16), then such TP periodicity shift could be found using the alignment of sequence S with the position-weight matrix (PWM) W0 (see Equation 1). This matrix was created using M0(3, 16), as it was performed previously for the MT(3, 4) matrix34 and is shown below in Equation (1). To create the W0(3, 16) matrix, each element of the M0(3, 16) matrix was transformed to the argument of the normal distribution, using the normal approximation for the binomial distribution. Dynamic programming could be used to find the global alignment of the S sequence with respect to the W0(3, 16) matrix. This alignment can be performed by cyclic alignment, as was done previously.35 However, the problem is that there are no stored M0(3, 16) matrix and the corresponding W0(3, 16) matrix for the sequence S0 and sequence S is unknown. Using the sequence of an existing gene, it is impossible to identify M0(3, 16) and W0(3, 16) matrices. The reason why it is impossible to calculate this matrix is the uncertainty of the reading frameshift positions in the gene.For example, let us consider a sequence S0:{atg}50. If we delete a single nucleotide in the middle of S0, we obtain a sequence S={atg}25{tga}25. The matrices constructed for the sequences S0 and S [M0(3, 16) and M(3, 16)] are shown in Table 1A and B, respectively. Table 1B shows that for the S sequence, all available base pairs that could be constructed from the existing reading frame would receive a similar positive weight, when the M(3, 16) matrix is transformed into the W(3, 16) matrix (PWM). Thus, using the global alignment of the S sequence with respect to the W(3, 16) matrix36 (or of the HMM37), it would be impossible to find the TP periodicity shift. This is because the deletion in position 76 of the S sequence shall not be created by global alignment with the W(3, 16) matrix. Such a shift could only be found if the M0(3, 16) matrix is known, and the W0 matrix is created on its base. Therefore, the task is to develop a mathematical method to find the W0 matrix and perform a global alignment of the S sequence relative to W0.(A) Matrixes M0(3, 16) and (B) M(3,16)(A) Matrixes M0(3, 16) and (B) M(3,16)This study partially utilized the algorithm that we developed in our previous work.32 This algorithm employs a particular property of the P(x > F) probability, which is calculated for the global alignment of the S sequence with the PWM. It was shown that the value P(x > F) is lower for the W0(3, 16) matrix compared with the W(3, 16) matrix. Here, F is the similarity function value of the global alignment (see Equation 2). This means that we must elaborate on a procedure for optimizing the W(3, 16) matrix to find the W1(3, 16) matrix that is closest to the W0(3, 16) matrix. In this case, we obtained the maximum value of the F similarity function and the lowest value of the P(x > F) probability, as well as the global alignment of the S sequence with the W1(3, 16) matrix. This global alignment allows us to determine the coordinates of the potential reading frameshifts. The optimization was performed using the algorithm shown in Fig. 2. The idea of the algorithm is to create a random matrix Wr(3, 16) (or a set of random matrices), followed by optimization with a genetic algorithm and obtaining the W1(3, 16) matrix as a result of optimization. Matrices have 3 columns and 16 rows, hence optimization takes place in a 48-dimensional space. Schematically, this optimization is presented in Fig. 3. At each optimization step, we move along the 48-dimensional space and obtain the intermediate matrices, which are represented by asterisks. Let us consider the crucial points of this algorithm.

Methods for creating a W2(3, 16) random matrixHere p2(k)=p(l)p(m)<U+2060>, where p(l) and p(m) are the probabilities of the l- or m-type nucleotides in the S2sequence (l, m<U+2208>{a, t, c, g}); p(l) = q(l)/N, q(l) is the number of l-type nucleotides in the S2 sequence, and N is the S2 sequence length. This PWM calculation considers two types of statistical regularities in the S2 sequence. On the one hand, it considers heterogeneities in the nucleotide frequencies at each codon position, because the p2 probability without specificity to each codon position is used. On the other hand, this matrix also considers the correlation of neighbouring bases, because the expected number of each of the 16 pairs is calculated for each i position in the codon, i<U+2208>{1, 2, 3}.2.3. Optimization of the W2(3, 16) matrix using genetic algorithm and dynamic programmingWe found Emax, the coordinates of the maximum imax and jmax as well as the coordinates of the beginning of the alignment i0 and j0, for each sequence from the set Gr. We tested different values of K0 and chose K0 = -1.8. In this case, the sum of differences i0 and j0 from 400, plus the sum of the differences imax and jmax from 800 were minimal and equal to 46 nt.Let us continue to consider Equation (2). For this equation n = s(k) + 4(s(j) - 1) ranges from 1 to 16. The index k is calculated using transitions already created in the F matrix. As the matrix W2t(a(i),n) is calculated for pairs of bases, to calculate k, it is necessary to determine the previous base of sequence S, which is included in the alignment. The previous base can be found by calculating the path to the cell with coordinates (i, j). If we get to the (i, j) cell from the (i - 1, j - 1) cell and we get to the (i – 1, j – 1) cell from the (i – 2, j – 2) cell, then k = j – 1. This corresponds to the transitions F(i – 2, j – 2) => F(i – 1, j – 1) => F(i, j) in the matrix F. Such a move corresponds to the diagonal move, and there are no insertions or deletions. If we get to the (i, j) cell from the (i - 1, j - 1) cell, to the (i - 1, j - 1) cell from the (i - 1, j - 2) cell and to the (i - 1, j - 2) cell from the (i - 2, j - 3) cell, then k = j - 2. This move corresponds to the skipping of a single base in the sequence S. Therefore, the transitions in the matrix F are F(i - 2, j - 3) => F(i - 1, j - 2) => F(i - 1, j - 1) => F(i, j). The longer deletions in the sequence S (not longer than h) are treated similarly. Assuming that there is a deletion of length q in the sequence S; this means that k = j - 1 - q and the path to the cell (i, j) is F(i - 2, j - 2 - q) => F(i - 1, j - 1 - q) => … => F(i - 1, j - 2) => F(i - 1, j - 1) => F(i, j).Here i, j, k and l also denote the bases: 1 = a, 2 = t, 3 = c, 4 = g. Equation (8) is based on the assumption that the weight of a pair of bases (i)(l) separated by two bases (j and k) can be calculated based on the weights of the neighbouring pairs (i)(j) and (k)(l). Therefore, to estimate the weight of the pair separated by two positions, one can use the average weight of 16 possible neighbouring pairs. Here i and l are fixed, and j and k run from 1 to 4. If we delete three columns of the matrix, we return to the matrixW2t<U+2060>. This will be correct for all deletions that are multiples of 3. Therefore, we used Equation (7) for column deletions of length 1, 4, 7, … and we used Equation (8) for column deletions of length 2, 5, 8, ….Here, averaging over the four previous bases occurs and the weight depends only on the base in position j. In this case, the W4' matrix replaces the W2t matrix, but n = s(j) according to Equation (2).The d constant (see Equation 2) plays an important role. It is intuitively clear that the smaller the statistical significance of TP in the S sequence, the higher the d value should be. To select the d value, we generated 1,000 sequences of 600 nt long for each level of the TP in the form of the x normal distribution argument33 in the interval from 0 to 20 and with a step of 1. Then in a random position of this sequence, no closer than 100 nt from the beginning and end, a deletion of one base was introduced. Let us call each set of such sequences MP(x). For each MP(x) set, we selected the d value in such a way that the number of insertions or deletions that were made by the method outside the distance (±50) from the artificial deletion did not exceed 5%. The obtained d values are presented in Fig. 4. The dependence of the d value (see Equation 2) on the TP, of the analysed sequence. The TP was calculated using the TP matrix33 and is expressed in the arguments of the normal distribution and is shown along the x-axis.The dependence of the d value (see Equation 2) on the TP, of the analysed sequence. The TP was calculated using the TP matrix33 and is expressed in the arguments of the normal distribution and is shown along the x-axis.Simultaneously with the F matrix, the inverse transition matrix was also filled, as is usually the case when searching for global alignment. Then, using the inverse transition matrix, the alignment of the S sequence with respect to the W2t matrix was constructed, and the value of the Fmax similarity function in the cells of the matrix F(N, N), F(N + 1, N), …, F(N + h, N) was determined.The transformation of matrix W2 into matrix W2t makes possible the achievement of similar distributions for the values of Fmax on the set of random sequences of S for different W2 matrices. This is the essence of the transformation of matrix W2 into matrix W2t<U+2060>. The similarity of distributions enables us to use Fmax as a measure of the similarity of the matrix W2t and the analysed sequence S. This allows consideration of the W2t matrix having the largest value of Fmax as the matrix that best represents periodicity in sequence S. It is possible to carry out all the calculations without such transformation and using W2t<U+2060>. Also, it is possible to use matrix W2 instead of matrix W2t in Equation (2). However, the comparison of Fmax for different W2 matrices will have to be done by the Monte Carlo method, which considerably slows down implementation of the genetic algorithm (Section 2.3.2).When implementing the genetic algorithm, we considered the Fmax value as the target function whereas the W2(3, 16) matrix was considered as the ‘organism’. The use of the genetic algorithm for optimizing the W2(3, 16) matrix was examined in detail in Ref. 32, and the reader is hereby referred to that publication. Let us consider in general the operating process of the genetic algorithm. First, the MR set of the W2(3, 16) random matrices with a volume of 500 matrices was generated. Each matrix was created as described in Section 2.1. Thereafter, each matrix was transformed to obtain a set of matrices with the same R2 and Kd, as described in Section 2.3.1 and in Ref. 32. Consequently, a number of MRt matrices were obtained. Each matrix from the MRt set was subjected to the dynamic programming procedure to align with the S sequence, and the Fmax value was calculated as described in Section 2.3.1. Fmax was considered as the target function. Thereafter, two matrices from the MRt set were selected, and the higher the probability of selecting these matrices, the greater was the value of the Fmax objective function thereof. These two matrices ‘intercrossed’, and a ‘descendant’ was created. A descendant is a matrix, which possesses part of the cells from one matrix and a part of the cells from another. Then, one matrix from the MRt set ‘perished’, and the probability of collapse was greater, the lower the Fmax value for this matrix, and its place was taken by the descendant. In addition, random ‘point’ mutations were introduced in 10% of the randomly selected matrices from the MRt set. Also, the greater the probability that the chosen matrix would be selected to introduce random mutations, the lower was its Fmax. Mutations were introduced into a random cell, and the number contained there was changed to a random number in a uniform interval from -5 to +5. Let us call the entire process an iteration. Therefore, within a single iteration, the Fmax value is calculated in 500 matrices, one matrix is deleted, one descendant is created, and random ‘point’ mutations are introduced into 50 matrices. Let us call mFmax the maximum value for Fmax, which is obtained within a single iteration of the MR set. Then, the MR set is replaced by the MRt set and the process is repeated from the very beginning.In the result of the genetic algorithm operation, the mFmax was continuously increased. The genetic algorithm operation was stopped after the mFmax value stopped increasing during 50 iterations. On average, about 9 × 103 iterations are required to reach this point.2.4. Developing a measure of significance for the phase shifts of TPAfter carrying out the genetic algorithm, we obtained a single W1(3, 16) matrix (Section 2.1) which possesses the maximum similarity function (mFmax) and the alignment of the S sequence with respect to the columns of the W1(3, 16) matrix. We are not interested in the mFmax values itself (it characterizes the TP level in the sequence), but rather in the statistical significance of the found TP phase shifts. To estimate it, the mFmax value was divided into three parts using the alignment sequence S and the W1(3, 16) matrix. The first part is the region of the S sequence, where the positions of the W1(3, 16) matrix columns and the reading frame in the S sequence coincide. In Fig. 5, this area is designated as V1. The second part (Fig. 5, V2) accounts for coincidences of the following form: 1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 1, and the third part (Fig. 5, V3) falls on coincidences of the following form: 1 => 3, 2 => 1, 3 => 2. The sum of V1 + V2 + V3 - kd is equal to mFmax, where k is the number of inserts or deletions, and d is the price for insertion or deletion from Equation (2). Initially, the W1(3, 16) matrix is unconnected with the reading frame. Therefore, cyclic rearrangements of the W1(3, 16) matrix were carried out, so that V1 = V2 and V1 = V3. As an indicator that could tell us about the presence of phase shifts of TP, we assumed V2 + V3. Scheme of division of mFmax on V1, V2 and V3 (see Section 2.4).Scheme of division of mFmax on V1, V2 and V3 (see Section 2.4).For each gene we defined a threshold V0 = V2 + V3, below which it could be said that there were no TP phase shifts in the sequence. The V0 value was selected for each S sequence, using the SR sequences set. As gene sequences possess various lengths and different MT matrixes,29 the selection has to be done for each gene. The SR set contained 103S sequences, where the codons were randomly shuffled. Such a shuffling obviously destroys all probable TP phase shifts. We selected the V0 value that provided no more than 20 sequences with random insertions or deletions in the SR set. Such insertions or deletions were considered to be significant [N(V0) = 20], where N is the number of sequences with a random shift of TP. If V2 + V3 = 0, then the SR set was not created, because there were no TP phase shifts in the sequence.3. Results and discussion3.1. Estimation of the first and second type error rates of the developed methodIn order to determine the number of errors of the first and the second type, we used all the coding sequences in the A. thaliana genome, which constitutes 48,322 cds. These sequences were downloaded from the Ensembl website (ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/release-38/plants/fasta/arabidopsis_thaliana/cds/). We replaced all symbols (except a, t, c and g) in these sequences with a randomly selected nucleotide. Such a replacement was made for all studied cds.Then, the RN set was created by the random shuffling of codons of the sequences from the initial set. Sequences from the random set should not contain TP phase shifts while having the same statistical properties as sequences from the initial set. The RN set allows estimation of the number of errors of the first type (true positive). We applied the approach developed by us to sequences from the RN set. In the result, we found 1,098 sequences with the TP phase shift, with V2 + V3 value higher than the threshold level. The total number of TP phase shifts in these sequences was 1,549.It is also interesting to determine the number of errors of the second type and the power of the method. To do this, another test set (RD) was created using coding sequences from the A. thaliana genome having a length longer than 500 nt (40,621 sequences). The codons in these sequences were randomly shuffled. Then, a single-base deletion was introduced in a random position of each sequence not closer than 100 nt from the beginning or the end of the sequence. These sequences were analysed using the developed algorithm, and the results are presented in Table 2. This table shows that the method identified 28,357 sequences in the RD set, where V2 + V3 = V0, and the predicted position is in the range of ±50 from the artificial deletion. This shows that second type errors constitute 30%, and so the power of the method constitutes 70%. Also, the method rather accurately predicts the location of the frameshifts, because it was only in 1,128 sequences that frameshifts were found outside the region ±50 from the deletion point. It should also be noted that the method does not create a significant number of random frameshifts. This is because 29,485 sequences with statistically significant frameshifts (28,357 + 1,128) contain 29,888 shifts, i.e. 403 frameshifts are due to purely random factors.Search for phase shifts in the set RDSearch for phase shifts in the set RD3.2. Searching for potential frameshift mutations in coding sequences from the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and several other eukaryotic genomesAll coding sequences were analysed from the A. thaliana genome. In the result, we identified 9,930 cds with one or more TP phase shifts, which could indicate the presence of frameshift mutations in these sequences. A total of 14,951 TP phase shifts were found in these cds. This indicates that in many cds we detected multiple TP phase shifts. As the number of false positives within the RN set constitutes 1,549 TP shifts (see Section 3.1), then the first type error rate could be estimated as about ~11%. As we are dealing with cds derived from mRNA, we also excluded the TP phase shifts found in the cds obtained by the alternative splicing of the same gene. In this case, 6,624 unique cds remain in the A. thaliana genome.For further analysis, the sequences where the TP phase shifts were found were divided into subsequences in accordance with the TP phase shift coordinates. Therefore, each sequence was split at least into two subsequences. Further, subsequences longer than 60 nt were translated into amino acid sequences in accordance with two frames (except the one, which was already present in the original gene). Two alternative frames must be considered, because we do not know which of the subsequences possesses the correct frame. If we have a single TP phase shift in the x coordinate, the reading frameshift could be registered in the sequence from 1 to x or in the sequence from x to the end of cds. The developed method is incapable of distinguishing between these two cases, and we cannot exclude the possibility that there was a frameshift at the beginning of the gene. As a result, 43,499 sequences longer than 20 amino acids were obtained. Next, for these sequences, the blastP program was employed to search against the Swiss-Prot database (E-value cut-off 0.1). Consequently, a similarity was found for 824 subsequences from the 774 cds. This means that for ~774 cds, the frameshift was also confirmed by the amino acid sequence similarity.Let us consider an example of a cds with a TP phase shift from the A. thaliana genome, for which a similarity was found using an alternative reading frame. The sequence identifier is AT1G79920.2, and the corresponding amino acid sequence identifier in the Swiss-Prot is F4HQD5_ARATH. A TP phase shift was found at the 1933 position, and thereafter, the frame changes from the first to the third. Table 3 presents the resulting W2t(3,16) matrix. For the third reading frame, an amino acid sequence was also obtained. Table 4 shows that the F4HQD5_ARATH sequence possesses a similarity to the HS105_CRIGR sequence from the Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) genome only after 642 amino acids, which corresponds to the coordinate of the discovered frameshift. The E-value for the similarity found constitutes 4.6e-144. Beyond the 656 amino acids of the HS105_CRIGR sequence, its similarity was observed with the amino acid sequence created by the third reading frame, after the 1933 position from the AT1G79920.2 cds (Table 5). The E-value for this similarity constitutes 4.6e-19. This example obviously demonstrates that simultaneously there are two similar proteins, one of which possesses a reading frameshift, while the other does not. The first one is the heat shock protein 70 (F4HQD5_ARATH) from the A. thaliana genome, while the second one is the heat shock protein 105 kDa (HS105_CRIGR) from the Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) genome.The matrix W2t(a(i),n) (see Equation 2) that was used for the construction of the final global alignment of cds AT1G79920.2 (point 2.4)n = s(k)+4(s(i) - 1), and a(i) was calculated as i – 3int(i/3) for i = 1,…, N. The index k is calculated using the already created transitions in the matrix F (see the text under Equation 2). Columns 3 through 6 correspond to the bases s(i), the second column corresponds to the bases s(k), and the first column shows the positions a(i).The matrix W2t(a(i),n) (see Equation 2) that was used for the construction of the final global alignment of cds AT1G79920.2 (point 2.4)n = s(k)+4(s(i) - 1), and a(i) was calculated as i – 3int(i/3) for i = 1,…, N.

The cds were also obtained from the Ensembl database (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/fasta/). These genomes include those of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus and X. tropicalis. Table 6 presents data on the number of potential reading frameshifts. The level of errors of the first and second type corresponds to those estimated for the A. thaliana genome, with accuracy of ±5%. From Table 6, it can be seen that these genomes contain on average from ~1.5 to 3 frameshifts in one cds.The number of cds with potential frameshift mutations in the six eukaryotic genomes examined, disregarding and taking into account alternative splicingThe data obtained in the work37 are also shown.The number of cds with potential frameshift mutations in the six eukaryotic genomes examined, disregarding and taking into account alternative splicingThe data obtained in the work37 are also shown.3.3. Searching for potential frameshift mutations in coding sequences from prokaryotic genomesWe also studied the presence of TP phase shifts in cds from 17 bacterial genomes. For example, using the A. deehalogenans genome, we studied the RN and RD sets (see Section 3.1) created from the cds set of this genome. The results of examining the RN set (codon-shuffled sequences) demonstrate that only 61 TP shifts could be identified. Thus, the number of errors of the first type (false positives) for this genome is about 8% of the number of cds found with the TP phase shift (Table 7, Column 3). In the remaining 16 genomes, fluctuations in first type error rates ranged from 6% to 14%.The number of potential frameshifts in cds from the 17 bacterial genomes (Column 2) obtained in the present studyColumns 4–7 show the data obtained in the work.37 Column 3 shows the shifts found within known genes (no closer than 50 nt before the start/end of the sequence).

In parentheses, the number of shifts is indicated, when the association with the adjacent gene occurs.

The number of shifts occurring in the area between known genes is shown in Column 5.Table 2 presents the results obtained from studying the RD set. This table shows that from 3,460 codon-shuffled cds with an artificial frameshift, in 2,975 sequences, TP phase shifts were found within the ±50 nt interval. In 68 cases, TP phase shifts were predicted outside the ±50 nt region from the artificially created deletion. This implies that the number of errors of the second type constitutes ~14%, and the power of the method is ~86%. The results of analysis of the TP phase shifts in the remaining 16 genomes are presented in Table 7, Column 2. The total number of TP phase shifts is shown in Table 7, Column 3. The table shows that the number of TP phase shifts in bacterial genes ranges from several dozens to hundreds per single genome.3.4. Comparison with the Genetack-GM programIt would be interesting to compare the obtained results with the results obtained previously while searching for reading frameshifts. It has been recorded that the Genetack-GM program showed the best results among other frameshift prediction methods, hence our results were compared with this program.17 For this purpose, the complete sequences of the 17 prokaryotic genomes were downloaded from the Ensembl database39 and submitted to the GeneTack-GM software program. GeneTack-GM is a combination of the GeneMark program designed to indicate coding sequences in a genome, and the Genetack designed to search for potential frameshifts.37 In the case of prokaryotic sequences, the Genetack software program searches for cases of potential frameshifts that resulted in the splitting of a single coding sequence into two independent ones (the author claimed that, in modern databases they are usually represented by two separate genes). The result of the GeneTack-GM software is the predicted coordinates of a gene (usually a hypothetical gene) and the coordinate of a frameshift within the gene.We compared the coordinates of frameshifts obtained by Genetack for the 17 bacterial genomes with the boundaries of known genes indicated in the annotation to the corresponding genomes in the Ensembl database. Frameshifts found by the GeneTack-GM were divided into three categories according to their position in the known genes. The results are presented in Table 7. The first category includes frameshifts found within the known genes (not closer than 50 nt to the start/end of the gene) (Table 7, Column 4). The second category includes frameshifts that occur at the edges of the known genes (not more than 50 nt from the start/end of the gene). For this category, it is also indicated in parentheses whether this frameshift leads to uniting a gene with the neighbouring one (i.e. to predicting a hypothetical gene), if the coordinate of the end of a hypothetical gene predicted by the software program captures the following gene by more than 100 nt (Table 7, Column 5). The third category includes frameshifts occurring in the area between the known genes (Table 7, Column 6). It is evident that most of the frameshifts found by GeneTack are pertaining to the second and third categories. This implies that the presence of these frameshifts is connected to the fact that the two adjacent genes that are indicated in the Ensembl database are combined by the GeneTack-GM software program into a single gene or into one gene that captures parts of these genes.However, this study evaluated the presence of reading frameshifts in known genes (cds). At a distance no closer than 50 nt from the boundaries, our method found more than 70% of the frameshifts. This 70% relate to the first category of frameshifts (70% of the data in Table 7, Column 3). A comparison of 70% of Columns 3 and 4 shows that our approach found a significantly large number of reading frameshifts within the already known genes, compared with the GeneTack-GM software program, with a lower false positive rate (8–14% for our program versus 32% for the GeneTack software program).Similar results were obtained when comparing the results obtained in the present study for the A. thaliana genome with the data presented in the GeneTack database for the genome. A total of 2,067 potential reading frameshifts were found in the A. thaliana genome by the authors of GeneTack, whereas we were able to detect 14,951 TP shift cases (see Table 6). It should be noted that we analysed only the cds, whereas the GeneTack database contains data for mRNA sequences, which also includes the non-coding sequences (5' and 3' untranslated regions). Therefore, we also divided the 2,067 reading frameshifts into three groups, as shown in Table 7. The first group includes frameshifts which are located inside the cds not closer than 50 nt from the beginning and end of the coding section. The second group includes frameshifts that are located at a distance not more than 50 nt from the ends of cds, and in the third group the frameshift corresponds to the mRNA non-coding regions. The first group includes 485, the second group includes 710, and the third group includes 872 reading frameshifts.A more detailed study of the distribution of frameshifts by position in genes from the A. thaliana genome is shown in Fig. 6. The increase in the number of frameshifts at the end of cds may be due to the fact that the sequences at the end of the gene do not greatly affect the structure of the encoded protein. However, it is surprising that such an increase is also found at the beginning of the gene. It is difficult to imagine that such mutations will not change the biological function of the encoded protein. Rather, it can be assumed that the observed frameshifts are compensating, which return the reading frame to its original position. The initial frameshift could be at the very beginning of the gene and we were unable to see it using this method. Our approach may not find a frameshift due to a large penalty for insertion or deletion (d in Equation 2) if it occurs at a distance <20–30 bases from the start of the gene. However, the second, already found frameshift, just compensates it. In this case, the distance to the frameshift revealed at the beginning of the gene should be similar to the distance between the pairwise compensating frameshifts that we find in cds. We constructed a distribution between the pair compensating frameshifts. This distribution is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from the figure that the average distance between the compensating frameshifts is <0.1 of the corresponding gene size. This result supports our hypothesis that paired compensating frameshifts often occur at the beginning of a gene. This hypothesis explains the surprisingly large number of TP phase shifts, which was revealed at the beginning of the genes in Fig. 6. Distribution of shifts position in the sequence of a gene. The x-axis shows the distance as a percentage of the beginning of the gene (with step equals to 5%), the y-axis shows the percentage of shifts per interval of 5%.

If we compare the results in relation to the first group, then this difference will be greater, because more than 70% of the frameshifts detected are related to the first group (Fig. 6). Similar results were also obtained for all other eukaryotic genomes (Table 6). The result could be explained by the fact that if the HMM is trained on a set of selected mRNAs,21 statistical properties, such as k-mer frequencies, are averaged over the set. In the result of the averaging, the HMM parameters are changed so that the number of errors of the first and the second type could be increased. Consequently, some frameshifts could be missed by the HMM-based method. Let us illustrate this statement for brevity and simplicity using the classical Markov models. Consider two sequences, seq1 = ‘ttgccagagcagattgcccagattgccagatt’ and seq2 = ‘aactcggtaacggtctaaactcggtacggtcta’. The conditional probabilities of the nucleotide pairs of these sequences are presented in N1 and N2 (Table 8A and B). The matrix represents the probability P(Xn+1 = in+1|Xn = i n), where Xn+1 corresponds to the rows of the matrix, and Xn corresponds to the columns. A Markov model was built using the conditional probability matrix N1 or the N2. The matrices N1 and N2 can be used to search for sequences with similar nucleotide correlations as the sequences seq1 and seq2. Let the probabilities P11 and P22 be the probabilities that the sequences seq1 and seq2 are generated by the N1 and N2 matrices, respectively [P11 = (0.5)22 and P22 = (0.5)22]. The probability P12 that the sequence seq1 was generated using the matrix N2 is equal to zero [P12 = (0)22 = 0] as well as the probability P21 (that the sequence seq2 was generated using the matrix N1). However, the probability that a randomly shuffled sequence was generated using the matrix N1 PR1 = 0 is zero, PR2 = 0 because in the randomly shuffled sequence there will be pairs of nucleotides, for which P(Xn+1 = i n+1|Xn = in) = 0 both in the matrix N1 and in the matrix N2. Therefore, one can find sequences similar to seq1 or seq2 surrounded by random sequences using the Markov model at a statistically significant level.The matrices of conditional probabilities P(Xn+1=i n+1|Xn=i n), created by the sequences seq1 = ttgccagagcagattgcccagattgccagatt (A), seq2 = aactcggtaacggtctaaactcggtacggtcta (B) and unification of these sequences (C)Xn+1 corresponds to the rows of the matrix, and Xn corresponds to the columns of the matrix.The matrices of conditional probabilities P(Xn+1=i n+1|Xn=i n), created by the sequences seq1 = ttgccagagcagattgcccagattgccagatt (A), seq2 = aactcggtaacggtctaaactcggtacggtcta (B) and unification of these sequences (C)Xn+1 corresponds to the rows of the matrix, and Xn corresponds to the columns of the matrix.But if a Markov model is trained using both sequences seq1 and seq2, the matrix N3 would be constructed (Table 8C). In this case, the probabilities of generating seq1 and seq2 are (0.25)22 and the same probability will be obtained for any other sequence of the same length, including the randomly shuffled sequence. So, the identification of seq1 and seq2 using the Markov model is impossible at a statistically significant level. We can say that the statistical properties of these sequences are averaged.The same phenomenon can be observed in the case of real genes, when a training sample is created for HMM from many genes. This effect was employed on the Genetack-GM program. We created two sets of artificial genes (Q1 and Q2) with different types of triplet frequency using different synonymous codons and used the sets to train HMM. Each artificial gene had a length of 1,500 bases and contained a start codon as well as a stop codon. Each set has a volume of 1,000 sequences. Also, we created a set Q3 of 1,000 sequences, half of which were of type Q1, while the other half were of type Q2. Additionally we created two sets D1 and D2, which had the same TP as the sets Q1 and Q2, respectively. But each sequence contained one deletion in a random position, but not closer than 100 bases from the beginning or the end. In order to exclude the effect of the stop codons resulting from the frameshifts, we replaced them with randomly selected coding codons. The volume of sets D1 and D2 was 100 sequences each.First, we trained the Genetack-GM program on sets Q1 and Q2 and searched for frameshifts in sets D1 and D2, respectively. The program found shifts in 75 sequences from set D1 and 17 from set D2. Trained Q3 Genetack-GM was applied to sets D1 or D2. In the result, the program found 8 and 0 sequences with frameshifts, respectively. This example shows that combining different genes into one training set can significantly degrade the capabilities of the HMM. In our method, such averaging does not occur because we analyse each cds without using a training set; the method is adjusted to the TP that exists in each considered cds. This means that the mathematical method finds an optimal correlation matrix considering the possibility of insertions or deletions for each analysed cds. The final alignment of the studied sequence against the obtained matrix provides an alignment and coordinates of the potential reading frameshifts. It is also important to note that to search for potential frameshifts using our method, one needs only cds without any other information or training set. This is the main improvement of the method in comparison with HMM to determine the reading frameshifts.Genetack performance was also tested on a set of cds without additional non-coding regions. We randomly selected 1,000 cds from the A. thaliana genome. In each of these cds, we deleted a single nucleotide in a random position (but no closer than 100 nt from the beginning or end of the sequence). Then, we inserted a random nucleotide just before the stop-codon to keep the sequence length. Genetack and the method developed here were applied to this set. In the result, Genetack predicted frameshift in 615 sequences and our method in 676 sequences (inside ± 50 nt from the actual deletion position). The HMM for Genetack was trained by GeneMark on a set of 100,000 cds from A. thaliana. Then in each cds with deletion, we changed the stop and start codons that occurred after the deletion in the first frame to a randomly chosen coding codon. Then, we again applied both programs to this set. In the result, Genetack correctly predicts frameshift only in 277 sequences and our method in 624. The reduced number of frameshifts found by our method could be explained by the decreasing TP quality after the codon changes. The result demonstrates that Genetack is more suitable for the detection of frameshift that separates a single coding sequence into two (or more) independent genes as it was pointed by the authors.17 But Genetack weakly predicts frameshifts if they do not lead to the formation of the premature stop-codon or if we have only cds without surrounding non-coding regions.We identified TP phase shifts in 660 genes, which constituted 83% of the first group, out of 1,183 genes discovered by the GeneTack software program in cds (2,080 genes found in cds and non-coding regions in the work21). Besides, more than 70% of the frameshifts found in our earlier publications for prokaryotic genes were identified using the developed algorithm.30,40 At the same time, for prokaryotic genes, a higher number of potential frameshift mutations was discovered using this method. This is because the developed method works much better with sequences having a low level of TP.3.5. Discussion of the possibility of creating new genes through frameshift mutationsFor many years, a study of the evolution of genes has attracted the attention of researchers. After determining the sequences of many prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes, the research in this area has significantly expanded. It is now believed that new genes are created by duplicating already existing genes.41 Therefore, a large number of genes are grouped in families based on the similarity of the amino acid or nucleotide sequences.42 Processes such as gene fusion,43 exon shuffling,44 alternative splicing45 and lateral gene transfer46 are considered to be the principal mechanisms of the creation of a variety of genes in a genome and the corresponding proteins. However, using such mechanisms, it is difficult to create a fundamentally new sequence, but a frameshift mutation could do this efficiently. It has previously been suggested that frameshift mutations could play a significant role in the process of creating new genes.8,9 The authors of the presented works have proposed that if a protein for some reasons is not under the selection pressure, frameshift mutation could persist and eventually lead to functional divergence. It is mainly this phenomenon that we observed in the present work. More than 20% of the studied eukaryotic cds contain potential frameshift mutations. The question that remains is, how does a protein sequence bear any biological sense after the reading frameshift? It could be assumed that the genetic code could be perfectly adapted to such changes, and it allows the frameshift mutations to obtain biologically meaningful sequences.Search for frameshifts in genes by the developed method can be done online at: http://victoria.biengi.ac.ru/fsfinder.50% of this research was supported by the RSF grant 14-24-00175, while the other 50% was performed within the framework of the state order No. 01201371082.Conflict of interest None declared."

IntroductionCommon wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome constitution AABBDD), a major food crop, is an allohexaploid species derived via allopolyploid speciation through interspecific crossing between cultivated tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum L. (AABB) and its diploid relative, Aegilops tauschii Coss. (DD).1–4 The cultivated tetraploid form was domesticated from the wild tetraploid wheat T. turgidum subspecies dicoccoides (AABB), which was thought to be derived through interspecific hybridization between wild diploid progenitors of the A and B genomes. The A genome donor was the wild diploid wheat T. urartu,5,6 and the B genome could have been contributed by Ae. speltoides Tausch (SS).7–10 However, the origin of the B genome remains unclear, despite extensive research over the past few decades. The cytoplasmic genomes of allopolyploid wheat species were almost certainly transmitted from Ae. speltoides,11,12 indicating that at least Ae. speltoides contributed to establishment of the nuclear genome of allopolyploid wheat.The indefinite origin of the wheat B genome is due to failure of homoeologous chromosome pairing between the B genome of allopolyploid wheat and the S genome of Ae. speltoides during meiosis in the respective interspecific hybrids.13,14 In addition, the section Sitopsis of Aegilops includes four wild diploid species, Ae. bicornis Jaub. et Spach. (SbSb), Ae. searsii Feldman et Kislev ex Hammer (SsSs), Ae. sharonensis Eig (SlSl), and Ae. longissima Schweinf. & Muschl. (SlSl), except Ae. speltoides. Of the five Sitopsis species that share the S genome,15 only Ae. speltoides of the subsection Truncata is cross-pollinating, whereas the other four subsection Emarginata species are self-pollinating. Two subspecies of Ae. speltoides (ligustica and speltoides; syn. Ae. aucheri Boiss.) have been defined to date,16,17 and they can be distinguished at least in part by a single locus, Lig, on chromosome 3S, which controls spike morphology.18 The two Emarginata species, Ae. longissima and Ae. sharonensis, are quite closely related and recognized as forming one complex.19–22 The F1 hybrid plants among Sitopsis species show incomplete homoeologous pairing during meiosis,23 suggesting that differentiation to the modified S genome occurred during diversification of the Sitopsis species. Some chromosomal rearrangements in the S genome, including translocations, have been reported in Sitopsis species.20,24 In addition, the B and S genomes can exhibit differences in the pattern of transposable element insertion.25,26 Structural differences in intergenic regions have therefore increased the phylogenetic distance between the B genome of polyploid wheat and the S genome of Ae. speltoides. Constitutive heterochromatic regions detected by chromosome staining are much more abundant in B-genome chromosomes than those of the A and D genomes,27,28 and the staining patterns of B-genome chromosomes appear to differ from those of S-genome chromosomes of Ae. speltoides.27 The difference in heterochromatin bands results in reduced pairing between B and S homoeologous chromosomes.28,29 These structural modifications and distinct heterochromatin distribution have made it difficult to elucidate the origin of the B genome and assess the relationship between the Sitopsis genomes and B genome.Molecular phylogenetic studies based on nuclear DNA polymorphisms (e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms [RFLPs] and amplified fragment length polymorphisms [AFLPs]) have revealed that the two subsections of Sitopsis are extensively differentiated7,21,30 and that the wheat B genome is much more closely related to the S genome of Ae. speltoides than to the other modified S genomes of subsection Emarginata species.7,21 Analyses of nucleotide sequence polymorphisms in single-copy genes also supported the hypothesis that Ae. speltoides is the donor of the B genome in allopolyploid wheat.31,32 In contrast, a few reports have suggested a polyphyletic origin of the wheat B genome via the introgression of several parental Sitopsis species.33–35 For example, a low copy number, non-coding sequence located in the region comprising 19% of the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 3B exists only in Ae. searsii among all Sitopsis species.33 Moreover, nucleotide sequence analyses have revealed increased divergence in the B genome of modern common wheat compared with Ae. speltoides, and this divergence is thought to be a result of polyploidization events affecting B-genome evolution.34 Thus, the phylogenetic relationship between the B and S genomes of section Sitopsis should be reconsidered based on the polymorphisms of each limited chromosomal region as well as those covering the entire chromosomal regions of the B and S genomes.RNA sequencing is an effective approach for surveying large number of genome-wide polymorphisms derived only from the exon sequences in Aegilops species.36–39 In RNA sequencing of Aegilops species, polymorphisms identified without any reference genome information can be efficiently anchored to the homoeologous chromosomes of related species, such as common wheat and barley, based on conserved chromosomal synteny.40 Here, we conducted RNA sequencing analyses of leaf transcripts from section Sitopsis species to avoid the intergenic and repetitive sequences of wheat chromosomes. The objectives of the present study were to (i) identify genome-wide polymorphisms in the Sitopsis genomes, (ii) elucidate the phylogenetic relationship among Sitopsis species, and (iii) determine the wheat B-genome origin based on genome-wide polymorphisms anchored putatively to each chromosome of the B genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThree accessions of Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica (SS genome), four accessions of Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides (SS genome), two accessions of Ae. bicornis (SbSb genome), three accessions of Ae. longissima (SlSl genome), three accessions of Ae. sharonensis (SlSl genome), and four accessions of Ae. searsii (SsSs genome) were chosen as representatives of each species from the collection of the section Sitopsis at the National Bio Resource Project–Wheat, Japan (Table 1). These accessions of Sitopsis species were originally collected in the Middle East (Supplementary Fig. S1). A tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum) cultivar Langdon (AABB genome) was also used in this study. Triticum urartu KU-199-5 (AA genome), Ae. umbellulata KU-4017 (UU genome), and Ae. tauschii KU-2075 (DD genome) were used as outgroup species.List of the 19 accessions in the section Sitopsis used in RNA-seq analysesList of the 19 accessions in the section Sitopsis used in RNA-seq analyses2.2. RNA sequencingTotal RNA was extracted using Sepasol-RNA I Super G (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) from leaves of 2- to 3-month-old plants grown in a glass house. The extracted RNA was treated with DNase I at 37 °C for 20 min, after which paired-end libraries for RNA sequencing were constructed from 6 to 10 µg of total RNA using a TruSeq RNA Library Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to a previously reported protocol41 and then sequenced with 300-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The obtained reads were deposited in the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA007097. RNA sequencing data for the outgroup species (300-bp paired-end reads) were obtained from the DDBJ Sequence Read Archives: BioProject PRJDB4683 for Ae. tauschii KU-2075 and DRA006404 for Ae. umbellulata KU-4017.2.3. Quality control, alignment of paired-end reads, de novo transcriptome assembly, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/insertion-deletion (indel) callingFASTQC software (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ (6 July 2017, date last accessed)) was used to evaluate sequencing quality of the reads from each of the sequenced samples. Adapter sequences, low-quality bases with an average quality score per 4 bp of <30, and reads of less than 100 bp were removed using Trimmomatic software, version 0.33,42 and only filtered paired reads were retained for subsequent analyses. The filtered reads were aligned to the reference B genome sequences of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring43 using HISAT2 software, version 2.1.0.44 To select uniquely mapped reads for SNP and indel calling, reads with a mapping quality of <40 were filtered out using SAMtools.45 SNPs and indels were called using Coval46 under the same criterion reported by Nishijima et al.38; the depth of read coverage was =10, and >95% of the mapped reads designated different nucleotide sequences from the reference sequences. To obtain non-redundant SNPs, we selected the positions of SNPs at which the read depth was =10 and there were no ambiguous nucleotides in any of the samples. We prepared two sets of non-redundant SNPs for construction of phylogenetic trees for intra- and interspecific comparisons of nucleotide variations. One was estimated in all of the samples, including A, D, U genome species, and the other was in the section of Sitopsis species and the wheat B genome. The distribution of SNPs/indels was visualized on the physical map of the B genome using CIRCOS47 and R statistical software. De novo transcriptome assembly of Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica KU-7716 was performed using Bridger.48 Unmapped reads of Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica KU-7716 were aligned to its assembled transcripts using Bowtie.49 If the breadth coverage of the unmapped reads over a transcript is 100%, its corresponding annotated transcript was searched in the published transcripts of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (iwgsc_refseqv1.0)43 using BLASTN.502.4. Construction of phylogenetic treesNeighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software, version 5.05.51 A Kimura 2-parameter model was used as the substitution model for tree construction. To assess node reliability in the trees, bootstrap probability was calculated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. To construct phylogenetic trees for each chromosomal segment, the chromosomal regions of the B genome were divided into ranges of 60 Mbp each, generating a total of 86 segments that included 124–931 non-redundant SNPs and 79–442 informative polymorphic sites (Supplementary Table S1). NJ trees for each subset of non-redundant SNPs were constructed using MEGA software. Phylogenetic network trees were constructed using SplitsTree4.522.5. Nucleotide divergence between Sitopsis species/subspeciesTo estimate nucleotide divergence between Sitopsis species/subspecies, two distance parameters were calculated: fixed substitutions between species53 and average number of nucleotide differences between species.54 To clarify positional changes in nucleotide divergence between Sitopsis species and the B genome of T. aestivum, the chromosomal regions of the B genome were divided into ranges of 20 Mbp each. A total of 262 segments of subsets of non-redundant SNPs in Sitopsis species and the B genome of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring were obtained. The fixed nucleotide differences and average number of nucleotide differences between Sitopsis species and the B genome were estimated for each subset of non-redundant SNPs. Non-synonymous fixed nucleotide differences were estimated using the variant annotation and effect prediction tool SnpEff.55 The number of genes per 20 Mbp was counted based on the Chinese Spring annotation.433. Results and discussion3.1. RNA sequencing detected numerous SNPs in Sitopsis species and the common wheat B genomeTo identify genome-wide SNPs and indels in Sitopsis species and the wheat B genome, RNA sequencing of 19 representative accessions of the five Sitopsis species was performed, generating 2–3 million filtered paired reads for each species (Table 2). Of these short reads, 67–81% were uniquely aligned to the B genome sequences of Chinese Spring, and 32,836–130,687 SNPs and 323–1,890 indels were identified. The fewest SNPs and indels were found in Ae. bicornis, whereas the other four species had similar numbers (Fig. 1). High within-species variance in the number of SNPs and indels was detected but considered a potential artifact because the number of filtered reads differed among the tested accessions (Table 2). To examine this possibility, the correlation between the number of filtered reads and SNPs/indels was determined. However, no correlation was observed between the number of SNPs and indels and the number of filtered reads, suggesting that the high variance is a genetic characteristic of section Sitopsis (Supplementary Fig. S2).Bar charts illustrating the number of SNPs (A) and indels (B) between the B genome of T. aestivum cv.

Chinese Spring was calculated with HISAT2 version 2.1.0.To confirm that RNA sequencing could identify genome-wide SNPs and indels, the chromosomal distribution of SNPs and indels was examined (Fig. 2). SNPs and indels identified in all of the tested accessions of Sitopsis species and the B genome entirely covered all of the chromosomes, with no clear difference in the distribution of SNPs and indels among Sitopsis species. Regions with scant or abundant SNPs on the chromosomes were quite consistent between species. For each chromosome, the number of SNPs ranged from 4,194 to 21,175, and the number of indels ranged from 34 to 317, with the high variance reflecting differences in SNP and indels numbers within species but not between species (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Phylogenetic relationship between Sitopsis species and B genome of bread wheatTo clarify the phylogenetic relationship and nucleotide divergence between species, we estimated sets of non-redundant SNPs anchored to each chromosome of the B genome in the 19 tested accessions of Sitopsis species and the B genome of Chinese Spring, with/without three outgroup species: T. urartu, Ae. umbellulata, and Ae. tauschii. Without the outgroup species, 30,589 non-redundant SNPs were obtained. When the outgroup species were included, 39,148 non-redundant SNPs were identified. These sets of non-redundant SNPs covered all of the chromosome of the B genome (Supplementary Fig. S4), allowing evolutionary analyses of section Sitopsis based on genome-wide polymorphisms.NJ and ML phylogenetic trees and a phylogenetic network tree were constructed based on the set of non-redundant SNPs with the outgroup species (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S5). The Sitopsis species were clearly divided into two clades. One clade included Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides and Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica, and the other clade included Ae. longissima, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. bicornis, and Ae. searsii; the two clades corresponded to subsections Truncata and Emarginata, respectively. This result was consistent with the results of previous studies based on RFLPs and AFLPs.7,21,30 The Emarginata clade was more closely related to Ae. tauschii and Ae. umbellulata than the Truncata clade. The B genomes of T. aestivum and T. turgidum were closely related to Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides and Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica in the Truncata clade. The average number of nucleotide differences and fixed nucleotide differences between Ae. speltoides ssp. and the B genome were the lowest in pairwise comparisons between species of section Sitopsis and the B genome (Table 3). These results supported the previous hypothesis that the B genome originated from the S genome of Ae. speltoides. Considering that the wheat B genome was not nested within the Truncata clade, the most recent common ancestor of Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides and Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica is likely the direct donor of the wheat B genome.Phylogenetic relationship among the 19 accessions of section Sitopsis species (S genome), the B genomes of T. aestivum cv.

The Truncata clade had longer external branches than the Emarginata clade. This observation could be explained by differences in the mating systems of the two clades: species of the Truncata clade are outcrossing, whereas species of the Emarginata clade are self-pollinating. The mating system of Ae. speltoides is highly outcrossing.16,21 RFLP analyses indicated that Ae. speltoides contained a higher proportion of heterozygous loci compared with other self-pollinating species of Sitopsis.56 Natural populations of Ae. speltoides would harbour nucleotide variations as heterozygous states. The tested accessions of Ae. speltoides had been maintained by self-pollinating for several decades in the Japanese gene bank, which could have led to fixation of one of the alleles in heterozygous sites, increasing the number of singletons within the Ae. speltoides accessions. This resulted in detection of a relatively large number of SNPs in the Ae. speltoides accessions (Fig. 1). In the Emarginata clade, Ae. searsii was monophyletic and separated from the other three species, whereas Ae. bicornis nested within Ae. sharonensis and Ae. longissima. Aegilops longissima diverged from Ae. sharonensis. The close relationship between Ae. sharonensis and Ae. longissima was consistent with previous reports7,21 and not inconsistent with a recent proposal that Ae. sharonensis is a subspecies of Ae. longissima.573.3. Identification of SNPs distinguishing subspecies ligustica/speltoides and Ae. sharonensis/Ae. longissimaThe phylogenetic tree did not discriminate well between subspecies of Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides and Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica, whereas the subspecies of Ae. longissima and Ae. sharonensis were distinguished. These subspecies are morphologically classified. Notably, differences in spike morphology between Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides and Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica can be explained by a single locus, Lig, located on chromosome 3S.18 If there are SNPs that would distinguish these subspecies (fixed nucleotide differences between subspecies), they could be related to the morphologic differences between the subspecies. Between Ae. speltoides ssp. speltoides and Ae. speltoides ssp. ligustica, 99 fixed nucleotide differences were detected (Table 3). The positions of these fixed nucleotide differences were scattered over the chromosomes (Fig. 4A). Ten of the fixed nucleotide differences caused amino acid substitutions between the two subspecies (Supplementary Table S2).

Chinese Spring from chromosomes 1B to 7B.Between Ae. longissima and Ae. sharonensis, 121 fixed nucleotide differences were found (Table 3). All of the chromosomes had fixed nucleotide differences (Fig. 4B), and they were most densely located on the end of the long arm of chromosome 4B. Of all total fixed nucleotide differences, 19 caused amino acid substitutions between the two species. Genes with these fixed nucleotide differences encoded proteins involved in a variety of biological functions (Supplementary Table S3). Lateral awn elongation is a key character distinguishing Ae. sharonensis from Ae. longissima, as Ae. longissima lacks a lateral awn.22 The heading time and growth habitats of these two closely related species are also distinct.22 The distal region of chromosome 4Sl, in which many fixed nucleotide differences accumulated, might control the morphologic and physiologic differences between Ae. sharonensis and Ae. longissima. Identification of the causal genes is a focus for future research.3.4. Contrasting pattern of nucleotide divergence in the distal and proximal regions of the chromosomesSome previous studies suggested the possibility of introgression from several parental Sitopsis species, supporting a polyphyletic origin of the wheat B genome.33–35 If introgression contributed to the origin of the wheat B genome, the phylogenetic relationship between species could possibly be verified based on chromosomal positions. To test this hypothesis, NJ trees were constructed for 60-Mbp regions on each chromosome (Fig. 5). Of a total of 86 phylogenetic trees, 83 exhibited a similar topology to that of trees based on entire chromosomes, in which the B genome of Chinese Spring was closely related to the Truncata clade including Ae. speltoides (Fig. 3). Two trees indicated that the B genome was closely related to the Emarginata clade (Fig. 5). These irregular trees were detected at the end of the long arm of chromosomes 1B and 3B. In the other tree, the B genome at the end of the short arm of chromosome 3B was located outside the Sitopsis species. Irregular topologies of the phylogenetic trees in the distal chromosomal regions. The chromosomal regions were divided into 86 segments of 60 Mbp each. NJ trees were constructed based on non-redundant SNPs located in each segment. Squares on the chromosomes in panel (A) correspond to the 86 segments. Phylogenetic trees of the white squares showed that the B genome of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring was the most closely related to Ae. speltoides in the section Sitopsis. This observation was consistent with those for trees constructed based on all non-redudnant SNPs (Fig. 5). Phylogenetic trees of the black squares showed that the B genome was closely related to Emarginata clades. A phylogenetic tree of the grey square showed that the B genome was located outside of Sitopsis species. Trees with irregular topologies at the end of the long arm of chromosome 1B (B) and the short arm (C) and long arm (D) of chromosome 3B are shown. Bootstrap probabilities with over 50% and scale bars are shown for each tree.Irregular topologies of the phylogenetic trees in the distal chromosomal regions.

Bootstrap probabilities with over 50% and scale bars are shown for each tree.We estimated the average number of nucleotide differences between the B genome of Chinese Spring and each of the Truncata and Emarginata clades as a parameter of genetic divergence between the B genome and each clade (Fig. 6). In the distal regions of the chromosomes, genetic divergence between the B genome and Emarginata clade was slightly less than that between the B genome and Truncata clade, whereas in the proximal regions of the chromosomes, genetic divergence between the B genome and Emarginata clade was greater than that between the B genome and Truncata clade. The proximal chromosomal regions tended to exhibit conspicuous disparity in terms of genetic divergence ([DE-B - DT-B]/DT-B × 100 > 0 in Fig. 6), but the range of this disparity differed among the chromosomes. Almost the entire region (~660 Mbp) of chromosome 3B exhibited clear disparity. In contrast, on chromosome 5B, the region exhibiting disparity was limited to within about 360 Mbp of the long arm. Except for chromosome 7B, the disparity appeared to be negatively correlated with the total number of non-redundant SNPs in Sitopsis species and the B genome. In chromosomal regions with larger number of non-redundant SNPs, genetic divergence between the B genome and Emarginata clade increased to the same extent as that between the B genome and Truncata clade. In addition, the disparity also reflected the number of genes; regions with fewer genes were found to exhibit greater disparity. Interestingly, this contrasting pattern of genetic divergence between the proximal and distal chromosomal regions corresponded to the gradient recombination rate along the chromosomes.58Contrasting pattern of nucleotide divergence in the distal and proximal regions of B-genome chromosomes. Average number of nucleotide differences per 20 Mbp between species in Truncata (=Ae. speltoides spp.) and the B genome of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (DT-B) and between Emarginata species and the B genome (DE-B) are plotted on each chromosome. The distributions of these differences are shown by line graphs (orange and green) in the top panels. Area charts in grey colour in the top panels denote the distribution of the total number of non-redundant SNPs per 20 Mbp in Sitopsis species and the B genome. Middle panels show the distribution of the ratio expressing disparity between the two genetic divergences ([DE-B - DT-B] × 100/DT-B) along each chromosome using bar charts.

Area charts in blue colour indicate the distribution of the number of genes along each chromosome.In common wheat, the recombination rate and chromosomal gene density increase as the centromeric region recedes.58,59 Multiple genes created by gene duplication are more frequently located in the distal regions of the chromosomes, where they potentially drive increases in gene density and the recombination rate.55 This observation coincides with the observed positive correlation between the disparity of genetic divergence and number of genes (Fig. 6). Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is known to generate gene trees in which the topology is discordant with that of species trees and tends to more frequently occur in rapid successions of speciation events.60,61 If speciation events in section Sitopsis had occurred over a relatively short time, ILS in the ancestral population of Sitopsis represents a potential factor blurring the phylogenetic relationship between Sitopsis species and the B genome. ILS is positively correlated with recombination.61,62 Indeed, distal chromosomal regions with an irregular phylogenetic topology (Fig. 5) exhibited more complex reticulate structures in the network tree compared with whole-chromosomal regions (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S6). In the interspecies comparisons, the internal reticulate structures represent data conflicts caused by phenomena such as ILS.63 Therefore, ILS could explain the irregular topology of phylogenetic trees in Sitopsis species (Fig. 5) and the unclear disparity of genetic divergence (Fig. 6) that were prominent in the distal chromosomal regions with a higher recombination rate.In the present study, a large number of SNPs and indels were discovered in the wheat B genome and five Sitopsis species based on RNA sequencing of leaf-derived transcripts. The polymorphic data would be useful for developing genome-wide markers on the S-genome chromosomes as performed for the wild diploid relatives, Ae. tauschii and Ae. umbellulata.38,39In conclusion, the present phylogenetic analyses based on genome-wide polymorphisms suggest that the B genome of common wheat was derived from the S genome of Ae. speltoides. A few chromosomal regions demonstrated the clearly exceptional relationship between the B genome and Sitopsis species, whereas the irregular topology observed could be explained by higher recombination rates in the distal regions of wheat chromosomes. Therefore, based on genome-wide polymorphisms identified from the RNA sequencing data, all of the chromosomal regions of the wheat B genome could have originated from the S genome of Ae. speltoides. Moreover, the failure of pairing between homoeologous chromosomes between the B and S genomes during meiosis could be due to factors associated with highly evolved regions or intergenic regions. The alignment rate to B genome of Ae. speltoides was not as high as those of Ae. bicornis and Ae. searsii (Table 2). Of the transcripts that were entirely covered with unaligned RNA sequencing reads, 18% encoded F-box proteins and disease resistance proteins such as NBS-LRR (Supplementary data S1). Positive selection is known to act on these protein genes and increase nucleotide substitutions between species.64–66 After separation of the B genome from the S genome, the different selective pressure between B and S genomes may contribute to enhancing their genetic differentiation. In addition, distinct patterns of accumulation of repetitive sequences could have led to the differential distribution of heterochromatic regions between the B and S genomes. To elucidate the molecular nature of the differentiation of the B and S genomes, future studies should compare the repetitive sequences over all chromosomal regions.Data availabilityAll read sequences were deposited into the DDBJ/GenBank/MMBL database with accession number DRA007097. RNA sequencing data for the outgroup species were used in the DDBJ/GenBank/MMBL database: BioProject PRJDB4683 for Ae. tauschii KU-2075 and DRA006404 for Ae. umbellulata KU-4017.Seeds of section Sitopsis species used in this study were supplied by the National BioResource Project–Wheat, Japan (www.nbrp.jp).

IntroductionThe green alga, Caulerpa lentillifera, belongs to the family Caulerpaceae of the order Bryopsidales. Macroscopic morphologies observed in the Bryopsidales are composed of a large, multinucleated, single cell (Fig. 1).1 This type of body plan is termed siphonous, and multicellularity is not observed in this group. Some siphonous algae, including C. lentillifera, reach meters in size, likely being the largest single cells on earth. C. lentillifera possesses structures analogous to fronds (leaf-like), stolons (stem-like) and rhizoids (root-like) (Fig. 1). Frond morphologies are diverse in Caulerpa. C. lentillifera resembles clusters of green grapes (Fig. 1), and is commonly known as sea grapes, or umi-budo in Japanese. This alga is one of the major edible seaweeds in the subtropical/tropical Asia-Pacific region, especially cultivated for market in Okinawa, Japan.2The siphonous alga, Caulerpa lentillifera.

The alga consists of many grape-like vesicles connected by stolons, and the entire alga comprises one cell with many nuclei. Scale bar, 10 mm.Some Caulerpa species become invasive, causing environmental disturbances in coastal waters worldwide.3 A recent report on microbial communities of marine sediments suggests that the relationship between Caulerpa and the microbial community is an important determinant of invasiveness.4 Cultivation and invasiveness depend upon asexual (vegetative) reproduction of macroscopic cells.5 Although multinucleate cells are also present in some clades of the Viridiplantae, including even land plants, homologies of molecular mechanisms associated with their development are little known.6,7Inter- and intra-class relationships of ulvophytes, including six major orders (Bryopsidales, Cladophorales, Dasycladales, Trentepohliales, Ulotrichales and Ulvales), remain controversial,8–10 although all members of this class are likely included in the monophyletic UTC (classes Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae) clade.11 Ulvophyceans are useful to understand evolutionary processes underlying cellularity and the diverse structural plans of green plants, because they display a variety of architectures, as well as having unicellular, multicellular and siphonous species. In addition, multicellular bodies composed of multinucleate cells are seen in the Cladophorales. It is thought that the hypothetical common ancestor was unicellular, and that siphonous body plans were not intermediate states in the development of multicellularity.12 These various types of morphogenesis have been studied extensively. For example, Ulva, which is multicellular, is one of the major experimental systems to explore mechanisms by which multicellularity evolved, as in Volvox.13 The draft genome of Ulva mutabilis has recently been published and provides insight into the evolution of multicellularity.14 The giant, mononuclear, unicellular Acetabularia, which belongs to the Dasycladales, has enabled elegant experiments for cutting and grafting of single cells to test whether the nucleus contains genetic materials.15Caulerpa likely provides a third experimental system among ulvophytes, since it is unicellular with multiple nuclei. As such, it should offer interesting comparisons with other major green plants, including land plants. However, no siphonous algal genome sequences were available for comparative genomic and developmental studies. Therefore, in order to explore evolution of plant structural plans and development, we decoded the genome of C. lentillifera and performed comparative genomic analyses using available green macroalgal genomes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Algal samples and nucleic acid extractionCaulerpa lentillifera, which originated from a population in Okinawa and has been cultivated in aquaria at the Onna Village Fisheries Cooperative, Okinawa, Japan, was used in this study. It is cultivated under natural light and is harvested during the daytime. Frond specimens for DNA extraction were washed with flowing UV-sterilized seawater for 4 days after harvesting, and those for RNA extraction were rinsed with 0.22-µm-filtered seawater. Any debris was removed from washed samples using tweezers. Fronds and stolons were separated for differential gene expression analysis. Algal samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80° C until nucleic acid extraction.High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was prepared from isolated nuclei. Isolation of nuclei followed the protocol of Zhang et al.16 with some modifications. Frozen samples were ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and dissolved in pre-chilled nuclear isolation buffer [0.5 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris (pH 9.0), 80 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mM dithiothreitol]. The purified nuclear pellet was dissolved in buffer G2 (Qiagen, 1014636). DNA was extracted using Qiagen Genomic-tips (10223, 10243). RNase and proteinase treatment and column purification followed manufacturer instructions. DNA was quantified using a dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, Q32851) and DNA purity was verified with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher). DNA integrity was checked with 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis.Total RNA was extracted from ground macroscopic cells using Plant RNA reagent (ThermoFisher, 12322012) and a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (74904) with DNase treatment. RNA purity and quantity were verified with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer. RNA integrity was confirmed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.2.2. Library preparation and sequencingAll sequencing libraries were prepared with protocols provided by the manufacturers, except for slight modifications described below. A whole-genome shotgun sequencing library was constructed using a KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, KK8502) with a PCR-free method. Genomic DNA was sheared to a target size of 550 bp using the Covaris M220 system. After Illumina-sequencing adapter ligation, fragmented DNA was size selected in 1.5% agarose gel cassettes (Sage Science, BDF1510) utilizing BluePippin (Sage Science). Two mate-pair libraries were prepared using a Nextera Mate Pair Library Prep Kit (Illumina, FC-132-1001). Gel-free and gel-based methods were used for 3-kb and 6-kb libraries, respectively. Size selection of gel-based libraries was performed with 0.75% agarose gel cassettes (Sage Science, BLF7510) and BluePippin. The library for RNA sequencing was constructed with a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, RS-122-2101). Fragmentation of purified mRNA was performed using the manufacturer’s standard protocol. Short-read DNA and RNA libraries were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq platforms, respectively. BluePippin sizing of a long-read DNA library was performed using 0.75% agarose gel cassettes for adjustment of the read length to 20 kb before being loaded into a PacBio RSII sequencer.2.3. Nuclear genome assembly and genome size estimationIn this study, we wished to study the Caulerpa lentillifera nuclear genome. To this end, we attempted to separate chloroplast genome sequences and possible contamination of bacterial sequences from nuclear sequences. First, adapter sequences and low-quality (<Q20) regions in Illumina data were removed with Trimmomatic 0.3317 and Sickle 1.33 (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle (6 October 2017, date last accessed)), respectively. Sequencing data from mate-pair libraries were filtered with NextClip 1.3.1.18(a) Chloroplast genome assembly and read removal: A blastn search with default settings was performed to find PacBio reads that encode the C. lentillifera rbcL gene (accession number JN034416.1). We extracted a total of 3 Mb of longer sequences from rbcL-encoding reads. Extracted reads were assembled using sprai 0.9.9.19 (http://zombie.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sprai/ (12 September 2016, date last accessed)) with default settings and the circularity of assembled contigs was automatically checked in the sprai pipeline. A single linear contig was constructed. To extend the contig, all PacBio reads encoding rbcL were aligned in the assembled contig using BLASR version 5.3.574e1c219 and flanking sequences at both ends were extracted. These sequences were assembled with the first-round PacBio reads with the sprai assembler to obtain a finalized circular contig. Sequence accuracy of the contig was polished with Arrow software (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus (24 July 2017, date last accessed)). All reads in the three genomic libraries that mapped onto the chloroplast genome using BWA 0.7.12,20 were removed.(b) Bacterial sequence assembly and read removal: Remaining reads were assembled using MetaPlatanus 1.0.3 (http://platanus.bio.titech.ac.jp (4 July 2018, date last accessed)) to identify bacterial sequences. MetaPlatanus performs di-codon-based clustering by considering inter-/intra-cluster linkages. Using this method as well as GC content of each cluster, bacterial sequences were identified and removed.(c) The nuclear genome assembly: The nuclear genome assembly without chloroplast and bacterial reads were generated with built-in programs in Platanus 1.2.4.21 Redundancy in primary assembly was removed using redundans 0.13c.22 After reduction, mis-assemblies were corrected using BIGMAC 5.123 and contaminant sequences in the scaffolds were removed using BinSanity24 (commit version: f29c60). Cleaned scaffolds were treated with an iterative scaffolding pipeline employing three software packages, PBJelly in PBSuite 15.8.24,25 BESST 2.2.626 and LINKS 1.8.5.27 The improved scaffolds were polished using BWA mapping of PCR-free Illumina reads and Pilon 1.22.28 BUSCO 3.0.229 with a Eukaryota dataset and CEGMA 2.530 were used to evaluate the final genome assembly. The genome size of C. lentillifera was calculated from k-mer histograms using Jellyfish 2.2.331 and the GenomeScope web tool.322.4. Variant site detection and repeat analysisThe number of variant sites was determined using another sequencing library from a single specimen. After adapter and low-quality region removal, reads were mapped onto the assembled genome using BWA. Ambiguous variant sites were removed using VCFtools 0.1.1533 with ‘+/d = 3/q = 30’ options.RepeatModeler 1.0.8 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler (15 September 2017, date last accessed)) and RepeatMasker 4.0.6 (http://www.repeatmasker.org (15 September 2017, date last accessed)) were used to identify repeated elements in the assembled genome. Kimura substitution level of transposable elements (TEs) was predicted using utility scripts bundled with RepeatMasker.2.5. Transcriptome assembly, gene prediction and annotationTranscriptomes were assembled de novo using Trinity 2.1.1.34 In addition, STAR 2.5.2a35 and Trinity were combined to assemble a genome-guided transcriptome. The two types of transcriptomes were further integrated considering strand information and genome sequences using PASA 2.0.2.36 To create a training set for gene prediction, two additional datasets were generated. Preliminary gene models were prepared from RNA-seq mapping for genome-guided transcriptome assembly using BRAKER1 pipeline 1.9.37 Protein sequences in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database were aligned with the genome using Exonerate 2.2.038 with the ‘–percent 80’ option to find a putative conserved gene set. EVidenceModeler 1.1.139 was used to create a training set with weight settings for results of PASA being 5, BRAKER1 being 2 and Exonerate being 1. Hint data about exon–exon junctions and repeat information for gene prediction were obtained with Bowtie 2 version 2.2.640 combined with STAR and RepeatModeler/RepeatMasker pipeline, respectively. A final set of gene models was generated using AUGUSTUS 3.2.141 with the softmasked genome and incorporated hint data after training.Sequence similarities between C. lentillifera gene models and NCBI RefSeq protein database release 79 were explored using BLAST searches (E-value cut-off of 10-5). HMMER 3.1b2 (http://hmmer.org (4 March 2015, date last accessed)) and Pfam-A 29.0 were used with default parameters to detect protein domains in gene models. Results of BLAST and HMMER searches were incorporated into gene annotations, which are available on the genome browser at http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/gallery/. The results of the HMMER search were used to find homeodomains (Pfam accessions PF00046 and PF05920) in gene models of each species. Gene Ontology (GO) IDs were assigned using InterProScan 5.22-61.0 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro (15 March 2017, date last accessed)) with a database provided by the InterProScan distributer. Transcription factors (TF), transcription regulators (TR) and protein kinases were annotated using iTAK 1.7 alpha.42 Genes involved in plant hormone biosynthesis and signalling were predicted by reciprocal BLAST search analysis with an E-value cut-off of 10-3. Plant hormone-related genes in Arabidopsis (Ref. 43; http://www.genome.jp/kegg (23 November 2017, date last accessed); http://hormones.psc.riken.jp (6 February 2017, date last accessed.)) were employed as query sequences in the BLAST search.2.6. Expression analysisRNA-seq libraries for expression analysis were prepared from fronds and stolons of three different specimens. Expression levels of genes were based on the normalized count per million (CPM) from RNA-seq data. A trimmed mean of m-values (TMM) method was used for normalization. TMM normalization, calculation of CPM and detection of significant differences between tissues were performed using edgeR 3.20.1.442.7. Phylogenetic analysisOrthoFinder 1.1.445 was used to identify orthologous gene clusters with default settings. The longest protein sequences in each locus were used. Gene models of 16 genomes were employed for genome-based species tree reconstruction (Supplementary Table S1). An additional dataset was analysed to compare species tree topologies (Supplementary Table S1). Single-copy orthologous gene clusters were aligned with MAFFT 7.30546 under default settings and extracted gapless regions using trimAl 1.4.147 with the ‘-nogaps’ option. IQ-TREE 1.5.348 was used to find partitions in concatenated alignments and optimal substitution models for each partition. These optimal parameters were used for both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses. A ML phylogenetic tree was inferred with 1,000 bootstrap replications using IQ-TREE. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree was created with MrBayes 3.2.6.49 The chain length for MCMC analysis was 1,000,000 and sampling frequency was each 1,000 generations. The first 25% of sampled trees were discarded as burn-in. Both trees were constructed using Cyanidioschyzon merolae as an outgroup. Topology of the tree was scored further using ASTRAL 5.5.650 and BUCKy 1.4.451 based on a ML method and a Bayesian method, respectively. Amino acid alignments of each single-copy gene cluster were re-used to assess concatenated tree topologies. ML trees for plant hormone-related genes were constructed as described previously.52 All generated trees were visualized using iTOL 3.5 (https://itol.embl.de (28 November 2017, date last accessed)).2.8. Comparative gene family analysis and syntenyAn UpSet plot of orthologous groups (OGs) assigned with OrthoFinder was visualized with UpSetR 1.3.3.53 The Dollop programme in PHYLIP 3.69654 was used to determine the presence or absence of OGs at ancestral nodes. Gains and losses of OGs in each clade were assumed from ancestral states based on least parsimony. The heat map of conserved OGs among green plants was visualized using the heat map function in R 3.6.0. Numbers of genes assigned within OGs were converted to robust z-scores defined by the median and interquartile range to calculate the relative abundances of genes.Putative lost genes were determined by the following method. The initial dataset was a set of amino acid sequences that were not classified into the same OG with Caulerpa lentillifera gene models or transcriptomes that were translated to proteins. These query sequences were aligned to the C. lentillifera genome using Exonerate under default settings. Sequences aligned longer than 50% of query length were excluded as candidates of lost genes. OGs including at least one chlorophyte gene were collected. Collected sequences were assigned as C. lentillifera lost homologues. GO IDs of putative lost homologues were assigned based on Pfam domains encoded in query sequences using Pfam2GO (http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO (25 October 2018, date last accessed)).Genes located within 50 kb upstream or downstream of BEL or KNOX were used to trace the duplication history of the homeobox genes. Synteny among BEL and KNOX paralogous loci was estimated based on conserved OGs and/or protein domains. Paralogous conserved OGs were given by analyses using OrthoFinder as described above. Conserved protein domains in gene models were identified from the result of HMMER searches using default settings.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and annotationWe performed whole-genome shotgun sequencing of genomic DNA using Illumina short-read and PacBio long-read platforms (Supplementary Table S2) and assembled the sequences using a Platanus21-based hybrid pipeline (Supplementary Fig. S1). The Caulerpa lentillifera genome was estimated to be ~26 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S2) and the resulting assembly comprised ~29 Mb (scaffold and contig N50 lengths, 948 kb and 324 kb, respectively) (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Statistics regarding the assembly are comparable to those of the Chlorella variabilis and Ostreococcus tauri genomes (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The heterozygosity rate estimated from the frequency of variant sites was ~0.4%. The GC content of the genome was 40%, lower than in other green algae, most of which have GC contents close to 60% (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Repetitive sequences constituted 6.7% of the genome, which is slightly higher than those in the genomes of Coccomyxa subellipsoidea (5.4%) and Ostreococcus tauri (5.3%) (Supplementary Table S4). Comparison of the substitution level of TEs among the four algal genomes showed a low frequency of low-substitution-rate TEs in C. lentillifera (Supplementary Fig. S3). The substitution level in the C. lentillifera genome is more similar to that of Ostreococcus than Chlamydomonas or Chlorella. The C. lentillifera genome contains 4.6% unknown repeats (Supplementary Table S5), which need to be further characterized in comparison with sequences of other ulvophytes. Assembly and annotation features of the Caulerpa lentillifera and other algal genomesAssembly and annotation features of the Caulerpa lentillifera and other algal genomesRNA-seq reads (29.2 Gb) assembled with the PASA pipeline36 (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S2) were used to produce gene models with AUGUSTUS.41 A final set of C. lentillifera protein-coding gene models numbered 9,311 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Mapping of RNA-seq reads to scaffolds confirmed that at least 6,231 of 9,311 genes (~67%) were expressed at the macroscopic stage of C. lentillifera.BUSCO29 analysis, which was used to evaluate the genome assembly, showed that 86.4% of BUSCO single-copy orthologous queries were completely aligned with the assembled genome and 81.8% of the input queries were present in a single copy (Supplementary Table S4). These proportions of the C. lentillifera genome are comparable to those of other green algal genomes so far decoded, indicating the accuracy of the C. lentillifera genome assembly. The genome size and gene density of C. lentillifera (one gene/3.2 kb) appeared intermediate among the green algae (Table 1).3.2. Phylogenetic analysesTo examine the phylogenetic position of the ulvophycean Caulerpa lentillifera among green algae, we constructed a molecular phylogenetic tree of algae and land plants, based on a comparison of 107 nuclear proteins from C. lentillifera and 15 published genomes (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S1). Our analysis showed that the diversification of C. lentillifera occurred earlier than the split of the Chlorophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae with topological consistency among calculation methods. Some of the concordance factors from BUCKy were not high among the UTC clade due to limited taxonomic sampling. High-quality chlorophyte transcriptomic data were found in public databases (Supplementary Table S1). By including an additional five species in the potential UTC clade, we confirmed that the topology of the early split of the Caulerpa lineage is maintained in the clade (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, an early branching of Caulerpa was evident among members of the UTC clade (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). Our present result (Supplementary Fig. S5), based on nuclear genes, failed to support the Ulvophyceae (Caulerpa and Ulva) as a monophyletic group.55,56Evolution of gene families in green algae showing predicted gains and losses of orthologous gene clusters in each branch.

Numbers in parentheses are average gene numbers in OGs.Based on a comparison of chloroplast genes, Fucíková et al.11 reported that siphonous ulvophytes, including Caulerpa, are sister to a part of the class Trebouxiophyceae. A mitochondrial multigene analysis supported a sister relationship between the Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae.57 However, our analysis demonstrated the earlier diversification of Ulvophyceae (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5) suggesting the paraphyly of Ulvophyceae to the other two clades. Specifically, our phylogenetic analysis was inconsistent with previous reports that used organelle-encoded genes.11,57 Genomic information from C. lentillifera will facilitate further exploration of the phylogeny of green plants. In addition, genomic data from lineages that have ancestral cytomorphological characters, such as Chlorocystidales, Oltmannsiellopsidales, Scotinosphaerales or Ignatiales,10,12 are needed to provide a more detailed evolutionary history of ulvophytes, because a recent analysis of the Ulva mutabilis genome indicated a sister relationship between Ulva and the Chlorophyceae.143.3. Comparative analysis of gene families and lineage-specific gene expansionsTo understand the gene content of siphonous macroalga and to elucidate plant gene family evolution, we classified all Caulerpa lentillifera proteins and compared them using OrthoFinder,45 with those of five other green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,58,Volvox carteri,59,Chlorella variabilis,60,Coccomyxa subellipsoidea61 and Ostreococcus tauri62) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S1). C. lentillifera had 4,256 of the classified OGs. In this comparative analysis, we used the term ‘OG’ to define a gene family. The classified OGs are likely sets of highly similar sequences that were derived from a single gene in the last common ancestor.45C. lentillifera OGs shared 3,846 of 8,547 Chlamydomonas OGs (45%), 3,779 of 8,273 Volvox OGs (46%), 3,470 of 5,407 Chlorella OGs (64%), 3,437 of 5,266 Coccomyxa OGs (65%) and 2,875 of 5,414 Ostreococcus tauri OGs (53%), respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S6). On the other hand, 131 of 4,256 C. lentillifera OGs were not found in the five other green algal OGs (Supplementary Fig. S6).Further analysis of gene acquisitions and losses in C. lentillifera was performed, based on phylogenetic relationships mentioned in Section 3.2 (Supplementary Fig. S4). This analysis showed that OG losses have occurred >76 times more frequently than OG acquisitions (Fig. 2). We annotated 2, 895 of putative OGs lost in C. lentillifera. Any green plant genes that were classified into 2,105 of the 2,895 OGs were not aligned on the C. lentillifera genome. These green plant genes did not show any similarity with the C. lentillifera transcriptome. Protein domains encoded in these putative lost genes in C. lentillifera were not uniformly conserved among other green plants (Supplementary Fig. S7a). On the other hand, 17 of 1,223 C. lentillifera lost protein-domains were conserved among the twelve green plants. Functions of lost protein domains are likely associated with intracellular locality (Supplementary Fig. S7b).The average number of genes per OG in C. lentillifera was 1.84, which is higher than in other green algae. This suggests more lineage-specific gene expansions in C. lentillifera (Fig. 2). Heat map analyses of 14,946 OGs among 13 green plant genomes showed that the pattern of gene expansions in C. lentillifera did not overlap with those of other UTC algal genomes (Supplementary Fig. S8 and Dataset S1). This suggests that these gene expansions are specific to the Caulerpa lineage.To further explore gene duplication in the Caulerpa lineage, we surveyed expanded OGs and performed GO analysis.63 We compared C. lentillifera with the five aforementioned algal taxa. In both categories of biological process and molecular function, ubiquitination-related GOs (GO: 0016567, GO: 0004842) were expanded in C. lentillifera (Supplementary Datasets S2 and S3). C. lentillifera genes for peptidase (GO: 0008233) and peroxidase activity (GO: 0004601) were more abundant than those of other algae (Supplementary Dataset S3). Analyses in cellular component categories also showed expansions of nuclear pore and COPI (coat protein complex I) vesicle coat (Supplementary Dataset S4). Interestingly, some nuclear pore-associated genes were expressed preferentially in fronds or stolons (Supplementary Fig. S9). For example, the GLE1-like RNA-export mediator was expressed preferentially in fronds.3.4. Evolution of Caulerpa genes for core regulatory networksOne of the most prominent characteristics of Caulerpa is its differentiated physical structure as a single cell. However, molecular mechanisms involved in development of the plant architecture without multicellularity remain unknown.7 To examine conservation and diversification of genes associated with core regulatory networks for morphology, we surveyed gene families for TF and TR. Comparisons with the plant database42 showed that TF gene families were comparatively conserved between them (Supplementary Dataset S5). One of the expanded gene families was the C3H class, the expansion of which has also been reported in the land plant lineage.42 In addition, homeobox genes of the HB-other class were abundant in the C. lentillifera genome (Supplementary Dataset S5). Molecular phylogeny showed that BEL and KNOX subclasses, which form heterodimeric TF complexes through gamete fusion,64 were expanded to eight genes in C. lentillifera (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S10). Such gene duplications have not been reported in other chlorophyte genomes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S10), although the land plant lineage shows a greater number of duplications in this subclass.42 DNA-recognition sites of some expanded BEL proteins deviated from conserved motifs (Supplementary Fig. S11). Unexpectedly, comparative analysis of eight loci paralogous to BEL and KNOX showed syntenic relationships with other genes within each of the BEL and KNOX families (Fig. 3b). The syntenic genes included 10 OGs based on conserved domains (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table S6). In addition, syntenic property appeared between BEL and KNOX (Fig. 3b). Because BEL and KNOX families belong to the TALE homeobox class, this suggests that the ancestral TALE TF gene has been expanded by segmental duplication (Fig. 3b).

In addition, both had higher expression in stolons than the other six BEL/KNOX genes in the macroscopic stage (Fig. 3c). Only BEL genes, abundantly expressed in the macroscopic stage, have diversified DNA-recognition sites (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. S11). These results suggest that the possible BEL/KNOX heterodimers may be core regulators involved in morphological differentiation of a macroscopic cell.3.5. Evolution of Caulerpa genes for plant hormone signallingIn land plants, hormone signalling regulates growth, development and responses to environmental stress, although the evolutionary origins of the signalling machinery remain unknown.65 It is tempting to ask whether homologues of Caulerpa lentillifera proteins are involved in formation and growth of multinucleated, giant cells, and/or adaptive responses. Although the majority of gene families for biosynthesis and hormone signalling in land plants65 are not found in the C. lentillifera genome, most genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling in land plants were conserved (Supplementary Datasets S6 and S7). In addition, some components of ABA signalling are expanded in C. lentillifera (Supplementary Dataset S8). Phylogenetic analysis showed that genes for protein kinase have also been expanded in a lineage-specific manner, although the Chlorophyta has only one orthologue for SnRK group 2 (SnRK2), an ABA signalling component (Supplementary Fig. S12a).Interestingly, Caulerpa-specific genes similar to land plant SnRK2 have been duplicated extensively, although the orthologues were likely lost in the land plant lineage. Additionally, 17 paralogs of SnRKs were tandemly clustered on scaffold 8 (Supplementary Fig. S12b). Extensive analyses of protein kinases showed that, in addition to protein kinases (class: CAMK_OST1L) including SnRKs, only the tyrosine kinase family (class: TKL_CTR1-DRK-1) has likely been expanded in the C. lentillifera genome (Supplementary Dataset S9). Another comprehensive survey of gene homologues for plant hormone biosynthesis clarified multiple tandem-duplicated genes of P450, which include a component of strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. S13). It is likely that a pathway involved in SL biosynthesis is also diversified in the Caulerpa lineage.4. DiscussionWe decoded the genome of a siphonous ulvophyte, Caulerpa lentillifera. Based on results of present and previous studies, we hypothesize the following cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the structural differentiation in the single cell (Fig. 4). First, we found expansion of some OGs in the C. lentillifera genome that may be involved in the siphonous body plan. Differential expression patterns of nuclear pore-associated genes, such as a GLE1-like RNA-export mediator, suggest that RNA localization is regulated not only by transportation of RNA in the cytoplasm,66 but also by nuclear position in the cell. The variations in expression profiles of transport proteins (Supplementary Fig. S9) imply that nuclei detect their own positions by unknown signals and express position-specific nuclear pore-associated genes (Fig. 4, left). Regulation of RNA transportation from nuclei by such genes function could play a role in different transcriptomic profiles in the structure, and structure-specific transcriptions may be regulated by nuclear import of TF using similar mechanisms (Fig. 4, left). It is likely that these phenomena enable structural patterning in siphonous algae without cell membrane boundaries, which are employed by multicellular organisms. Hypothesized function of diversified gene families in siphonous macroalgae. In Caulerpa, divergent BEL and KNOX genes were formed by lineage-specific duplications, and they are differentially expressed in the macroscopic cell. By our prediction, KNOX/BEL genes of Caulerpa that have similar functions to those of Chlamydomonas are expressed specifically in gametes. In addition, nuclear pore-associated genes regulate RNA and/or protein transport in development of complex siphonous algae, as shown in balloons. Molecular localization is also controlled by vesicle transport proteins. These transporters generate molecular signatures in structure patterning without multicellularity. Expanded ABA signalling-associated genes are employed to adapt to environmental stress associated with a sessile lifestyle.Hypothesized function of diversified gene families in siphonous macroalgae.

Expanded ABA signalling-associated genes are employed to adapt to environmental stress associated with a sessile lifestyle.Interestingly, expanded OGs in the C. lentillifera genome included the TALE class of homeobox proteins, including BEL and KNOX. These TALE homeobox genes are located at distant loci not only in C. lentillifera but also in Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis. Homeobox genes in land plant genomes have been expanded by segmental duplications.67 Although the evolutionary mechanism of such homeobox genes has been extensively studied in land plants, the mechanism of the first duplication has not been proposed. Our comparative analysis demonstrated the ancient homeobox locus and adjacent gene sets evolved by segmental duplication (Fig. 3b). The C. lentillifera genome thus provides the first suggestion of how the ancestral TALE TF gene was duplicated during eukaryote evolution (Fig. 3b). Ancestral BEL and KNOX may function in normal meiosis, mating and zygote development, as in Chlamydomonas.68 We hypothesize that less expressed BEL/KNOX genes in C. lentillifera macroscopic cells preserve ancestral functions in gametes (Fig. 4). On the other hand, some of duplicated homeobox genes in C. lentillifera may have promoted neofunctionalization and those genes may not regulate alternation of life cycles but morphogenesis as in the land plant lineage64,69 (Fig. 4). Differential expression of the homeobox genes in C. lentillifera can be interpreted as analogous to structural patterning through homeobox-protein antagonisms reported in land plants.69In summary, our analyses illustrate the utility of the C. lentillifera genome for exploring possible evolutionary processes in green plants. Therefore, this siphonous algal genome will help to integrate knowledge from various model systems through comparisons with derived developmental traits and will accelerate understanding of apparent convergent evolution in plants.Data availabilityAll sequence data obtained in this study are accessible in the DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI database at the BioProject ID, PRJDB5734.

IntroductionCultivated chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.), which is produced either as cut flowers or potted and garden plants, is an herbaceous perennial in the family Asteraceae (Compositae). Chrysanthemum was first cultivated in China and developed for horticultural purposes in East Asia. Soon after the discovery of the response of plants to day length, i.e. ‘photoperiodism’,1 it was determined that the flowering time of this short-day (SD) plant could be controlled for year-round commercial production by manipulating the day length using blackouts or artificial lighting. Chrysanthemum has also been used in classical physiological studies of photoperiodism, leading to the proposal that floral stimuli (florigens) and floral repressors (antiflorigens) are synthesized in the leaves under inductive/non-inductive photoperiods.2,3 Recent studies have demonstrated that FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its orthologues act as florigens in several species, including chrysanthemum.4–8 In 2013, an antiflorigen (CsAFT) was first discovered in a wild chrysanthemum by using a reverse-genetic approach.9 An ultra-dense linkage map was recently constructed in cultivated chrysanthemum,10,11 but the complex genome structure of the cultivated chrysanthemum, such as hexaploidy (2n = 6x = 54), along with the large genome size and self-incompatibility,12 have obstructed genetic studies on horticulturally and physiologically important characteristics.The genus Chrysanthemum found in Japan includes 32 species ranging from diploid (2n = 2x = 18) to decaploid (2n = 10x = 90).13 Diploid C. seticuspe (Maxim.) Hand.-Mazz., a wild relative of chrysanthemum, is closely related to cultivated chrysanthemum, with both plants being herbaceous perennial, SD responsive and self-incompatible. Although C. seticuspe is generally not thought to be a direct progenitor of the cultivated chrysanthemum, since it is suggested that cultivated chrysanthemum is derived from hybridization between other chrysanthemum species,14,15 it is considered a model species of cultivated chrysanthemum and is thus used for molecular-genetic and physiological analysis.The recent advances in next genome sequencing (NGS) technology have brought de novo whole-genome sequencing to various organisms. The sequencing cost has been dramatically decreasing while the quality of the assembled sequences has been increasing along with the growth of long-read sequencing technologies. However, de novo whole-genome sequencing is still costly in species with large genomes, and thus many of these species have not benefitted from the new NGS technologies. In this study, we performed de novo whole-genome assembly in C. seticuspe by using only the Illumina sequencing platform to achieve low cost assembly. Based on the assembled genome, gene discovery analysis was conducted for genes related to flowering, which is the most important trait in chrysanthemum. Genetic analysis was also performed such as linkage map construction, comparative phylogenetic investigation between C. seticuspe and other species, and identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cultivated chrysanthemum. Our approach suggests a potential strategy for advancing genetic and genomic studies in species that are not candidates for high quality de novo whole-genome assembly due to biological or other difficulties.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThree C. seticuspe accessions, AEV2, NIFS-0 and NIFS-3, were used in this study. AEV2 is a natural self-compatible mutant that was selfed for five generations to reduce genomic heterogeneity. The resultant line, XMRS10, was used for the whole-genome DNA sequencing. Linkage maps were constructed based on an F1 mapping population generated from a cross between NIFS-0 and AEV2. NIFS-3 was used for genome size estimation by flow cytometry and for transcript sequencing for simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker development for linkage map construction.The genome size of NIFS-3 was estimated in comparison with those of Arabidopsis thaliana ‘Columbia’, Oryza sativa ‘Nipponbare’, Dianthus caryophyllus ‘Francesco’, Ipomoea nil ‘Murasaki’, Eustoma grandiflorum ‘Piccorosa snow’ and Zea mays ‘Honey Bantam Peter 610’ by flow cytometry. Nuclei suspensions of young leaves were prepared using a solution of CyStain PI Absolute P (Partec GmbH, Münster, Germany) added to 2% PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone)and 15 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analysed with a PAS flow cytometer with 532 nm laser excitation.2.2 Whole-genome sequencing and assemblyTotal cellular DNA of XMRS10 was extracted from young leaves by using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used for construction of paired-end (PE) and mate-pair (MP) libraries. The expected insert size of the PE libraries was 500 bp, and sequences were generated by Illumina HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with read lengths of 101 and 301 nt, respectively (Supplementary Table S1a). Four MP libraries were constructed with expected insert sizes of 2, 5, 10 and 15 Kb and sequenced by HiSeq 2000 with a read length of 101 nt. Sequenced bases with quality scores less than 10 were filtered by PRINSEQ 0.20.4 (see Supplementary Table S2 for information on the bioinformatic tools used in this study), and adaptor sequences in the reads were trimmed using fastx_clipper from the FASTX-Toolkit 0.0.13. The genome size of XMRS10 was estimated by using Jellyfish ver. 1.1.6 based on a k-mer = 17 frequency.The MiSeq PE reads were assembled by SOAPdenovo2 rev 240 with k-mer = 127, and the gaps were closed by GapCloser 1.10 (P = 31, Supplementary Fig. S1). The resultant sequences were subjected to scaffolding with the MP reads using SSPACE2.0 with the parameters of -k 3 and -x 0. The gaps of the scaffolds were closed by GapFiller with the HiSeq PE reads. Potential contaminated sequences on the assembled scaffolds were identified and removed using BLASTN searches against the chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequence of A. thaliana (accession numbers: NC_000932.1 and NC_001284.2), against the human (hg19, https://genome.ucsc.edu/), fungal and bacterial genome sequences registered in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), against vector sequences from UniVec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/) and against PhiX (NC_001422.1) sequences with E-value cutoffs of 1E-10 and length coverage > 10%. The resultant draft genome sequences were designated CSE_r1.0. Assembly quality was assessed by benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCOs) using BUSCO v3.0 software. Known repetitive sequences registered in Repbase and de novo repetitive sequences defined by RepeatModeler 1.0.11 were identified by RepeatMasker 4.0.7.2.3. Transcript sequencing, gene prediction and annotationTotal RNAs were extracted from a total of 35 samples of XMRS10 grown under various conditions (Supplementary Table S3). Total RNA was extracted from shoot tips, leaves, young buds, flowers and roots using RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) followed by an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) for purification according to the manufacturer’s instructions and LiCl precipitation for the polysaccharide removal if necessary. Libraries were constructed by using a TruSeq standard mRNA HT sample prep kit (Illumina), and sequences were obtained by HiSeq 2000.Evidence-based gene prediction was first performed by BRAKER1 with the obtained transcript reads and the assembled genome sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2). The predicted genes were used as a training set for ab initio gene prediction by Augustus in the MAKER-P pipeline, along with the additional training sets derived from the following amino acid sequences: A. thaliana (TAIR10, https://www.arabidopsis.org/); D. caryophyllus (DCA_r1.0)16; Petunia axillaris (v1.6.2)17; Solanum lycopersicum (ITAG3.2)17; Populus trichocarpa (v3.0)18; O. sativa (IRGSP-1.0)19; Solanum tuberosum (PGSC DM v3.4)20; and Nelumbo nucifera (http://lotus-db.wbgcas.cn, downloaded June 2016). In parallel, evidence-based gene prediction was performed by mapping the C. seticuspe transcript reads onto the assembled genome sequences using the Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline and merged with the results of ab initio gene prediction by the MAKER-P pipeline. The resultant sequences were filtered by sequence length and annotation edit distance (AED) score, and then subjected to homology searches against the NCBI NR database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and A. thaliana in TAIR11 using BLASTP with an E-value cut-off of 1E-20. Domain search was conducted by InterProScan against the InterPro database with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. Transposable elements (TEs) were identified by BLAST searches against the NCBI NR database and domain searches against InterPro and GyDB 2.0 with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. The sets of sequences showed significant similarity against the databases, with the exception that TEs were designated as CSE_r1.1_cds. Functional analysis of coding DNA sequences (CDSs) in CSE_r1.1_cds was performed by classifying the sequences into the plant gene ontology (GO) slim categories and the ‘euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups’ (KOG) categories, and mapping onto the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGGs) reference pathways. Transfer RNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.23 with default parameters. rRNA genes were predicted by BLAST searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10. The A. thaliana 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (accession number: X52320.1) and 18S rRNA (accession number: X16077.1) were used as query sequences.2.4. Gene discovery analysis related to floweringThe genes related to flowering of C. seticuspe were identified based on the BLAST searches and OrthoMCL analysis (see below). The amino acid sequences of flowering pathway genes of Arabidopsis were used as query for tblastn search against CSE_r1.1_cds and CSE_r1.1_maker_cds. The phylogenetic tree of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) was constructed using the Neighbour-Joining method in MEGA7 software based on the amino acid sequences of PEBP from the plant species, Al: Arabidopsis lyrate, Am: Antirrhinum majus, At: A. thaliana, Bv: Beta vulgaris, Ci: Citrus unshiu, Cs: Chrysanthemum seticuspe; Ej: Eriobotrya japonica, Fv: Fragaria vesca, Gm: Glycine max, In: Ipomoea nil, Le: Lycopersicon esculentum, Lp: Lolium perenne, Md: Malus × domestica, Nt: Nicotiana tabacum, Os: O. sativa, Pc: Pyrus communis, Pn: Populus nigra, Pp: Physcomitrella patens, Ps: Pisum sativum, Ro: Rosa chinensis, Sm: Selaginella moellendorfii, Ta: Triticum aestivum and Vv: Vitis vinifera. Bootstrap values for 1,000 resampling are shown on each branch.Of the investigated candidate genes, three genes—CEN-like (Cse_sc005398.1_g060.1), CsAFL1 and CsFL—were subjected to gene expression analysis in rosette-forming C. seticuspe line NIFS-3. The rosette-forming plants were divided into two groups, a non-chilled group and a chilled (5°C, 4 weeks) group. After growing the plants under the respective conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3), shoot tips from each group were sampled for RNA extraction. Total RNA were extracted with an RNA extraction plant mini kit (Qiagen). The expression levels of the three genes were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. The primers used were as follows. For the CEN-like gene: qRT-f, AGGATTCATCAATCCATGTG; and qRT-r, CCTCCGTGAATATCAACCCG; for CsAFL1 (the AP1/FUL-like gene): CsAFL1-QF, TGATCCCTACATCAGTGCTCCA; and CsAFL1-QR: CAAGGGGGCAAGACTATTGATG; and for CsFL (a homologue of LEAFY): CsFL-QF, CTTTGTCATGCTGAACGGAGTG; and CsFL-QR, GAGCATATGACCAACACCACCA. CsACTIN (AB770470) was used as an internal standard to normalize raw data.2.5. Linkage-map constructionLinkage maps were constructed based on a F1 mapping population generated as a cross between NIFS-0 and AEV2. SNP genotyping by ddRAD-Seq analysis was performed for 84F1 individuals and the parental lines as described by Shirasawa et al.21 The ddRAD-Seq libraries were constructed with a combination of restriction enzymes, PstI and MspI and sequenced by MiSeq with a read length of 251 nt. The reads were mapped onto CSE_r1.0 by Bowtie2, and variant calls were performed by SAMtools 0.1.19 and VarScan 2.3 as described by Shirasawa et al.21 The candidate SNPs were filtered under the following conditions: exclude in/dels, minimum depth = 5, minimum quality = 10, max missing = 0.5, minor allele frequency = 0.2, polymorphic between the parental lines, and exclude AEV2 = Alt (alternative) homozygous.Segregation analysis was also performed using the SSR markers developed in this study. A total of 4,056,757 transcript sequences of leaves and shoot apices of NIFS-3 were obtained by Roche 454 FLX (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and assembled by Newbler 2.6 (Roche Diagnostics). SSR motifs on the assembled sequences were identified using SciRoKo software and the Fuzznuc tool from EMBOSS. Primers were designed by Primer3 for the SSRs that had 8, 5, 4, 3 and 3 repeats in the di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-motifs, respectively. Polymorphic analysis of the SSR markers was performed using an ABI 3730xl fluorescent fragment analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Isobe et al.22For linkage analysis, the segregating SNPs were grouped using MSTmap with the following parameters: cut-off P-value = 1, no map size = 0; the SSR loci were separately grouped by JoinMap 4. Then, correspondent SNP and SSR linkage groups (LGs) were identified and integrated based on segregation patterns in the mapping population. The segregation data was categorized into two parent-specific datasets and ordered by JoinMap 4 under the following conditions: Kosambi’s mapping function, LOD (logarithm of the odds) >1.0, REC frequency < 0.4, goodness of fit jump threshold for removal of loci = 5.0, number of added loci after which a ripple is performed = 1, and third round = yes.2.6. Comparative and phylogenetic analysisThe translated protein sequences of CSE_r1.1_cds were clustered by OrthoMCL with those of A. thaliana (Araport11, https://www.araport.org/data/araport11/), S. lycopersicum (tomato, ITAG3.2),17,Lactuca sativa (lettuce, Lsativa_467_v5, http://lgr.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/)23 and Helianthus annuus (sunflower, Ha412v1r1_port_v1.0)24 with the parameters c = 0.6 and aL = 0.9. The phylogenetic analysis was performed by MEGA 7.0.9 beta and TIMETREE based on the single copy genes conserved in C. seticuspe and the four species. The divergence time of 104 MYA between A. thaliana and S. lycopersicum was used for calibration. The published sequence read archive (SRA) transcripts for six cultivated chrysanthemum (C. × morifolium) varieties were mapped onto CSE_r1.0 by TopHat v2.1.1 (Supplementary Table S1b) in order to investigate the mapped ratios and identify variants. Variants were called based on the mapping result using SAMtools 0.1.19 and subsequently filtered using VarScan 2.3. SNP effects on gene function were predicted by using SnpEff ver.4.0.3. Results and discussion3.1. Whole-genome sequencing and assembly of C. seticuspeA total of 94.2 Gb of MiSeq PE and 137.5 Gb of HiSeq PE reads were subjected to k-mer frequency analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). Two peaks were observed in the distribution of the number of distinct k-mers at a given multiplicity distribution. Based on the multiplicity value of the higher peak (multiplicity = 67), the genome size of XMRS10 was estimated as 3.06 Gb. This estimated genome size was close to 2.90 ± 0.03 Gb, which was the estimated genome size of NIFS-3 by flow-cytometry analysis. The large difference in height between the two peaks (multiplicity = 67 and 134) suggests that most of the XMRS10 genome is homozygous; however, heterozygous regions still remain after selfing five times from AEV2.The 94.2 Gb MiSeq PE reads were assembled by SOAPdenovo2 (k-mer = 127) and GapCloser, and 6,480,313 scaffolds were generated with a total length of 3,189, 146,773 bp (Supplementary Table S4). Then, the sequences were further scaffolded by SSPACE2.0 with MP reads, and gaps were filled with HiSeq PE reads by GapFiller. After excluding contaminated sequences and those shorter than 500 bp, the remaining 354,212 sequences were designated as a draft genome sequence, CSE_r1.0, and subjected to analysis (Table 1). The total and N50 lengths of CSE_r1.0 were 2,721, 839,164 and 44,741 bp, respectively. The assembled sequences covered 89.0% of the XMRS10 genome when the genome size was estimated as 3.06 Gb. The CSE_r1.0 sequences were mapped onto the 1, 440 BUSCOs to assess the sequence quality. The number of complete BUSCOs was 1, 279 (88.8%), including 1,153 (80.1%) single copy genes and 125 (8.7%) duplicated genes. The numbers of fragmented and missing BUSCOs were 40 and 121, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). Although the assembled genome sequences were fragmented, the BUSCO results suggested that the CSE_r1.0 had an acceptable quality for gene prediction and annotation.Statistics of the C. seticuspe genome assembly and CDSStatistics of the C. seticuspe genome assembly and CDSThe total length of repetitive sequences in CSE_r1.0 was 1, 774 Mb, and these sequences occupied 72.5% of the C. seticuspe genome (CSE_r1.0, Supplementary Table S6). The ratio of repeat sequences was similar to that for lettuce (77.5%), which has an estimated genome size of 2.5 Gb.23 The ratio of unknown repeat sequences in CSE_r1.0 was higher than those in the sunflower and lettuce genomes. The total length of known repeats was 928 Mb, and Class I (long terminal repeat) elements were most frequently observed.3.2. Gene prediction and functional analysisA total of 717,973 genes were identified by the MAKER-P pipeline. Because the number of predicted genes was large, it was considered that a large number of suspicious gene sequences were included in the results. The AED score was therefore calculated for each gene, and filtering of the gene sequences was performed by AED score (<0.5) and sequence length (=300 bp). The resultant number of predicted genes was 158,374 and designated as CSE_r1.0_maker_cds. The gene sequences with more accurate estimations were further selected by means of a BLASTP search against the NCBI NR database and InterProScan. The remaining 71,052 putative genes were designated as CSE_r1.0_cds. The number of identified tRNA- and rRNA-encoding genes was 2,738 and 100, respectively (Supplementary Table S7).In order to investigate the quality of the predicted genes, a BLASTN search (E-value cut-off of 1E-10 and length coverage > 10%) was performed for 47 previously identified genes involved in flowering-time regulation in C. seticuspe NIFS-3.8,9,25,26 A total of 44 genes were found in CSE_r1.0_maker_cds, and three were missing (Supplementary Table S8). Of the 44 identified genes, four were tagged as TE, and not included in CSE_r1.0_cds. Thirteen sequences predicted by BRAKER1 showed higher similarity than those in CSE_r1.0_maker_cds. CsFTL2, one of the three missing genes, was found adjacent to CsFTL1 in one scaffold. PCR and Sanger sequencing showed that the physical distance between these genes was 2.5 kbp (Supplementary Fig. S5). The CDS identity of these genes was 96.4%.8 By using GeneScan, CsFTL2 was successfully predicted. The sequences or tags were replaced or added, and the revised sets of gene sequences were designated CSE_r1.1_maker_cds and CSE_r1.1_cds (Table 1).The results of gene prediction often differ according to the methods used, and there is no single best solution. Therefore, we combined multiple methods for gene prediction by MAKER-P and filtered the suspicious sequences. Although some genes were miss-classified as TE and the results of BRAKER1 were sometimes better than those of MAKER-P, the number of missing genes was only three of 47. In addition, there was a possibility that the two genes that were not identified by GeneScan do not exist in the XMRS10 genome. Hence, we concluded that CSE_r1.1_maker_cds covered most of the genes in XMRS10, but some of the genes might have been missed in CSE_r1.1_cds.The numbers of complete and partial genes in CSE_r1.1_cds were 15,304 and 55,753, respectively, while those in CSE_r1.1_maker_cds were 15,796 and 142,579 (Table 1). The putative genes (CDSs) having similarity to TE made up 35.2% of CSE_r1.1_maker_cds (Supplementary Table S9). The CDSs were tagged with ‘f’, ‘p’ and ‘d’ according to their level of similarity against the NR database (f: E-values = 1E-20 and identity = 70%; p: E-values = E-20 and identity <70%) and InterPro (d: E-values = 1.0). Of the 71,057 CSE_r1.1_cds, 55,197 (77.7%) CDSs were tagged ‘f’ (15,304 CDSs) or ‘p’ (39,893 CDSs). The number of CDSs tagged ‘d’ was 65,317.Functional analysis was performed for CSE_r1.1_cds by classifying the putative genes into the GO, KOG and KEGG databases. A total of 33,372 (47.0%) genes were annotated with GO categories, including 19,116 genes involved in biological processes, 6,780 genes coding for cellular components and 29,988 genes associated with molecular function (Supplementary Fig. S6). The ratio of annotated genes was less than in the other four compared species, i.e. sunflower, lettuce, tomato and A. thaliana. The genes in these four species were predicted based on pseudomolecules, while the C. seticuspe genes were predicted based on 354,212 scaffolds. Hence, it was considered that the C. seticuspe genes predicted in this study were more fragmented than the genes of the four other species used for comparison, and the fragmentation caused the lower ratio of annotated genes. A total of 54,735 genes showed significant similarity to genes in the KOG database, and the distributions of the KOG functional categories were similar to those of the compared species (Supplementary Fig. S7). The total number of mapped genes on the KEGG pathway was 4,941 (Supplementary Table S10).3.3. Gene discovery analysis related to floweringPhotoperiodic flowering is an important characteristic controlling the flowering time in the commercial production of chrysanthemums. In contrast to the model plant species such as Arabidopsis and rice, photoperiodic flowering of chrysanthemums is dependent on the absolute duration of darkness and is sensitive to light exposure at midnight.9 The majority of the photoperiod-dependent flowering pathway genes found in Arabidopsis, such as photoreceptors, circadian clock components or clock-controlled transcription factor genes, have been identified in the C. seticuspe genome (Supplementary Table S11). This indicates that the basic components in the photoperiodic flowering pathway are well conserved even among species with different photoperiodic responses, but that the regulation of each gene might be different or that a unique, alternative pathway might also exist in chrysanthemums.Photoperiodic floral initiation of chrysanthemums is regulated by the antagonistic action of two homologous FT/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)-like proteins. Three FT-like genes (CsFTL1, CsFTL2 and CsFTL3) and two TFL1/BFT-like genes (CsAFT and CsTFL1) were identified in C. seticuspe in previous reports.8,9,27 Two additional TFL1-like genes and one MFT-like gene were newly identified in this study, but no additional FT-like genes were found in the C. seticuspe genome (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment using the PEBPs from other plant species suggested that only three FT-like genes (CsFTL1, 2 and 3) have floral promoter activity, while four TFL1/CEN/BFT-like genes have floral repressor activity (Fig. 1B).28Gene discovery analysis related to flowering.

This habit of chrysanthemum is considered to be a type of dormancy adaptation in the annual cycle between growth and dormancy of herbaceous perennials.29 Flowering is blocked in dormant rosette-forming chrysanthemums even under floral inductive day-length conditions. This flowering incompetence is reversed by chilling, somewhat as in a vernalization response.29 It is noteworthy that the newly identified CEN-like gene (Cse_sc005398.1_g060.1) is highly expressed in the shoot tips of rosette-forming dormant plants that are incompetent to initiate flowering (Fig. 1C). In the chilled plants where expression of the CEN-like gene was suppressed to a low level, the expression of two floral meristem identity genes (CsAFL1 and CsFL) of C. seticuspe were up-regulated within three weeks after the transfer from the non-inductive NB to inductive SD conditions (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3). The expression pattern of the CEN-like gene indicates that this gene might be involved in the seasonal change of flowering competence in chrysanthemum.3.4. Linkage map constructionIn order to demonstrate an application of the assembled C. seticuspe genome to genetic analysis, C. seticuspe linkage maps were constructed based on an F1 mapping population derived from a cross between AEV2 and NIFS-0 based on ddRAD-Seq and SSR markers. The total bases of the ddRAD-Seq reads in each F1 individual were 43.8 Mb (203, 321 reads) on average. The reads were mapped onto CSE_r1.0 with a mean mapped ratio of 83.4%, and a total of 5,206 SNPs were identified. Meanwhile, a total of 66,438 assembled sequences were generated by Newbler2.6 from 2,626,286 454/FLX transcript sequences. Based on the 66,438 sequences, 9,605 primer pairs were designed on the flanking regions of SSRs identified by Fuzznuc (Supplementary Table S12). The existence of SSRs between the primer sequences was further investigated by SciRoKo, and the confirmed 3,140 SSR markers were subjected to the subsequent polymorphic analysis.Parent-specific linkage maps were generated for AEV2 and NIFS-0 with nine LGs in each. The number of mapped loci was 2,124 in the AEV2 map, while that in the NIFS-0 map was 2,239 (Supplementary Tables S13 and S14). The number of bins (non-identical locus positions) in AEV2 and NIFS-0 was 581 and 615, respectively. A higher ratio of segregation distortion was observed in the AeG5 and AeG6 LGs in the AEV2 map (Fig. 2). The reference alleles were more frequently observed at the distorted loci, particularly on AeG5, suggesting the existence of a biological bias in meiosis or chromosome pairing in AEV2.AEV2 (left) and NIFS-0 (right) bin linkage maps. Blue, red and green bars show locus positions mapped by SNPs, SSR markers and both types of markers.

Grey bars represent regions where mapped loci showed significant segregation distortion (P = 0.05).3.5. Comparison with other plant species at the gene levelThe translated protein sequences in CSE_r1.1_cds were clustered and compared with the protein sequences in other plant species (sunflower, lettuce, tomato and A. thaliana) at the amino acid level by OrthoMCL. Of the 71,057 genes in CSE_r1.1_cds, 59,927 genes were classified into 16,098 clusters and 2,405 were classified into C. seticuspe-specific clusters. A total of 19,979 (33.3%) of the genes were clustered with all four of the plant species compared (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S8). The finding that a larger percentage of C. seticuspe genes was clustered exclusively with sunflower genes (10.0%) compared to the percentage clustered exclusively with lettuce genes (3.5%) suggested that, between these two species in the family Asteraceae, sunflower showed the greater similarity to C. seticuspe. The family Asteraceae has been classified into 12 subfamilies,30 and the genera Chrysanthemum and Helianthus belong to the subfamily Asyeroideae, while the genus Lactuca belongs to the subfamily Cichorioideae. These results agree with the previous taxonomy studies.Venn diagram showing numbers of gene clusters in C. seticuspe, sunflower (H. annuus), lettuce (L. sativa), tomato (S. lycopersicum) and A. thaliana.Venn diagram showing numbers of gene clusters in C. seticuspe, sunflower (H. annuus), lettuce (L. sativa), tomato (S. lycopersicum) and A. thaliana.Phylogenetic analysis was further performed with the 2,280 single copy genes observed in the four Asterids species (C. seticuspe, H. annuus, L. sativa and S. lycopersicum) and A. thaliana, as A. thaliana was used for the outgroup (Fig. 4). Our results showed that the subfamilies Asterodeae and Cichorioideae diverged ~48.67 MYA, and this estimate agreed with the previous study.24 The divergence time between super tribes Asterodeae and Helianthodae was estimated as ~45.99 MYA, 2.68 MYA after the divergence of the subfamilies Asterodeae and Cichorioideae.A phylogenetic tree based on the 2,280 common single-copy genes of the four Asterids species and A. thaliana.A phylogenetic tree based on the 2,280 common single-copy genes of the four Asterids species and A. thaliana.3.6. SNP mining and identification of variants in hexaploid-cultivated chrysanthemumsDespite their importance as ornamental plants, cultivated chrysanthemums (C. × morifolium) are rather difficult to study at a genetic level due to their autohexaploidy, large genome size and self-incompatibility. Diploid genome sequences are often used as references of genetic and genomic analysis in polyploid species, such as rose (Rosa hybrida), strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas).31–33 The genome sequence of C. seticuspe, a diploid wild relative, can shed light on the complex nature of the cultivated chrysanthemum genome as a reference plant for chrysanthemum species.The transcript sequences of the six cultivated chrysanthemums (Supplementary Table S1b) were mapped onto the genome sequences of C. seticuspe and variants were identified in order to investigate the usefulness of the C. seticuspe genome for genetic studies in cultivated chrysanthemums. A total of 20.4–156.9 M reads of each variety were mapped onto CSE_r1.0. The mapped ratio of the reads ranged from 56.7% (Jinba) to 82.5% (Nannongxunzhang) (Supplementary Table S15a). Two factors were considered as the causes of the large difference in the mapped ratios: read length differences in the six cultivars (49~100 nt; Supplementary Table S1b) and different sequence similarities against C. seticuspe. The total number of SNPs identified among the six varieties was 954,706, and 294,601 SNPs were identified in all six varieties (Supplementary Table S15b). The remaining 660,105 SNPs (69%) were missing in one to five of the varieties, implying the existence of large gene sequence variation among cultivated chrysanthemums.The SNP genotype call was performed for the 294,601 SNPs that were identified in all six varieties with consideration for the percentages of reads having reference (Ref) and alternative (Alt) bases. SNPs with Alt read ratios of 8.35–91.65 were designated as hetero SNPs. A total of 27, 855 SNPs exhibited a uniform genotype among the six varieties (Supplementary Table S15c). These SNPs were considered to represent the variants between C. seticuspe, XMRS10, and cultivated chrysanthemum. The functions of the SNPs were annotated by SnpEff based on their positions in the mapped gene sequences (Supplementary Table S16 and Fig. S9). Of the total 22,470 genes, 14,741 were identified as SNPs with multiple impacts and 533 were identified as high-impact SNPs. As a result of breeding, cultivated chrysanthemums possess a wider variety of characteristics than C. seticuspe—including with respect to flowering time, flower shape and colour. Causative variants for the characteristics of cultivated chrysanthemums might be identified by further analysis of the functions of the SNPs.The results described above showed that the C. seticuspe genome is applicable to genetic and gene functional analyses in cultivated autohexaploid chrysanthemums. In autohexaploid sweetpotatoes, single-dose SNP markers were detected by using the genome sequence of diploid I. trifida and selected according to the allelic dose for each SNP locus, and a high density genetic map consisting of single-dose SNP markers was constructed.33 The technique is also applicable to high-density mapping for genetic improvement in cultivated chrysanthemums. A large number of genome-wide SNP markers are expected to be produced by mapping RAD-seq or other sequence data of cultivated chrysanthemum onto the assembled genome sequences, CSE_r1.0.4. ConclusionsIn this study, de novo whole-genome assembly was performed in the genus Chrysanthemum with Illumina reads only. Various NGS technologies have recently become available at reasonable cost, although some of these technologies are still expensive for organisms with large genomes. Illumina reads are the lowest-cost NGS technology, and unlike long-read technologies, Illumina does not require large computer resources for assembly. Although in this study the numbers of assembled sequences and predicted genes indicated that the sequences were still fragmented, the generated draft genome and linkage maps revealed the features of the C. seticuspe genome. In addition, a candidate flowering-related gene, the CEN-like gene (Cse_sc005398.1_g060.1), was newly discovered based on the assembled genome. Moreover, our results demonstrated the applicability of the C. seticuspe genome for genetic and gene functional analysis in cultivated autohexaploid chrysanthemums (C. × morifolium). The genome and gene sequences generated in this study are thus expected to contribute to future chrysanthemum investigations. In addition, our approach demonstrated the usefulness of short reads genome assembly and the importance of choice of NGS technologies depending on the purpose of post-genome analysis.5.

The pipeline integrates reference-assisted loci and de novo assembly strategies to construct high-quality sequences focused on gene content. Pipeline validation was conducted with wheat (Triticum aestivum), a hexaploid species, using barley (Hordeum vulgare) as reference, that resulted in the identification of more than 90% of genes and several new genes. Moreover, PGA was used to assemble gene content in Saccharum spontaneum species, a parental lineage for hybrid sugarcane cultivars.

In summary, PGA can reconstruct high-quality gene sequences from polyploid genomes, as shown for wheat and S. spontaneum species, and it is more efficient than conventional genome assemblers using low coverage DNA sequencing.","The Polyploid Gene Assembler (PGA), developed and tested in this study, represents a new strategy to perform gene-space assembly from complex genomes using low coverage DNA sequencing. The pipeline integrates reference-assisted loci and de novo assembly strategies to construct high-quality sequences focused on gene content. Pipeline validation was conducted with wheat (Triticum aestivum), a hexaploid species, using barley (Hordeum vulgare) as reference, that resulted in the identification of more than 90% of genes and several new genes. Moreover, PGA was used to assemble gene content in Saccharum spontaneum species, a parental lineage for hybrid sugarcane cultivars. Saccharum spontaneum gene sequence obtained was used to reference-guided transcriptome analysis of six different tissues. A total of 39,234 genes were identified, 60.4% clustered into known grass gene families. Thirty-seven gene families were expanded when compared with other grasses, three of them highlighted by the number of gene copies potentially involved in initial development and stress response. In addition, 3,108 promoters (many showing tissue specificity) were identified in this work. In summary, PGA can reconstruct high-quality gene sequences from polyploid genomes, as shown for wheat and S. spontaneum species, and it is more efficient than conventional genome assemblers using low coverage DNA sequencing.1. IntroductionEven with the progress of the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, the de novo genome assembly remains a bottleneck. It is observed mainly in the case of complex genomes, such as plants, which are more difficult to assemble without a reference genome. Usually, plant genomes are larger than most mammals genomes,1 have high polyploidy, contain a high number of repetitive regions and a high level of heterozygosity.2 In addition, they contain a large number of gene families with numerous members and pseudogenes with nearly identical sequences due to effects of recent whole genome duplication and transposon activities. For these reasons, de novo assemblies of plants using only short reads generally create a highly fragmented genome split into hundred thousand scaffolds.3 Although the cost of sequencing has declined exponentially in recent years made it feasible to achieve high sequencing coverage for plant genomes, this strategy has not shown enough to generate quality genomes, such as the cases of Triticum aestivum4 and Picea abies,5 which genome assemblies are highly fragmented with a sequencing coverage around 150×. Among the possibilities to increase the quality of these genomes, the development of new bioinformatics efforts can contribute to overcoming these constraints, especially, by exploring the continuous growth of closely related genomes and reference-assisted loci algorithms.6Plants from Saccharum genus have very complex genome with high level of polyploidy, among them the commercial cultivars of sugarcane have an economic relevance due to high amount of sucrose. They are generated from several crossings between Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum, followed by artificial selections of hybrids.7 The genome profile of those hybrids consists of 70–80% of chromosomes from the S. officinarum, 10–20% of S. spontaneum and a few with inter-specific recombinations.8,9,Saccharum spontaneum shows moderate sugar (8–10%) and high fibre (25–27%) contents, as well as high productivity (more than 180 t ha-1) and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.9,10 Moreover, S. spontaneum promises to improve fibre content in lignocellulosic feedstock that has an economically attractiveness for biofuels and other biochemicals production using recent technologies developed for biomass deconstruction.10 The species is autopolyploid with chromosome numbers ranging from 40 to 128 and genome size ranging from 2.5 Gb to 12.5 Gb, with many aneuploidy forms.8,11Due to its economic relevance of sugar and first-generation ethanol production, several groups have worked to disclose the molecular basis of commercial sugarcane varieties and significant contributions for genome and transcriptome profile were achieved. The SUCEST-FUN12 and ORFeome13 databases are great examples of large initiatives of researchers groups to understand the molecular biology of sugarcane. This database is a large platform that supports the development of System Biology projects of sugarcane providing information regarding the genome, gene expression and regulatory network. Apart from the SUCEST-FUN project, many other studies have made noteworthy contributions on the molecular basis of sugarcane.14 Recently, a draft genome from sugarcane covering around 40% of the monoploid genome and more than 25,000 genes was published using a combination of BACs (Bacterial Artificial chromosomes), Illumina and PacBio sequencing.15 However, most of these studies focused on commercial varieties of sugarcane, developed for the production of sugar and/or ethanol. A recent study of parental specie S. spontaneum investigated chromosomal structural rearrangements and disease resistance genes using whole genome sequencing.16 However, the features related to productivity and accumulation of fibres were not analysed and are extremely necessary when we consider the production of biofuels from biomass and the transition for a green and sustainable economy.In this work, we described a new and effective gene space assembly pipeline that allowed a reliable assembly of wheat (T. aestivum) and S. spontaneum genes using low coverage sequencing data. The identification of new genes, promoter regions, expanded gene families and transcriptome analysis of different tissues using reference-guided strategy were achieved. Our results showed the efficiency of Polyploid Gene Assembler (PGA) to reconstructed genes from complex genomes and contributed with new insights about the molecular basis of the S. spontaneum species, specifically involved with robustness and productivity of cane.2. Material and methods2.1. Plant material, genome and transcriptome sequencingThis study was performed using DNA and mRNA from S. spontaneum accessions US851008 and IN8482. Leaf, apical meristem, node, bud, internode and root tissues from three biological replicates (individual plants) were harvested from 9-month old and greenhouse-grown plants, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. For the DNA extraction, 100 mg of leaf tissue were grinded in liquid nitrogen using the Mini-Beadbeater-96 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, EUA), for 1.5 min. Each sample was resuspended in 700 µl of Extraction Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 20 mM EDTA, 2% CTAB, 1% PVP 40, 1.4 M NaCl, 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 65°C for 30 min, homogenizing every 10 min. Then, 800 µl of chloroform–isoamylalcohol (24:1) was added to the tubes, gently mixed and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (450 µl) was transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube, containing 120 µl of Extraction Solution (5% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl), added with 570 µl of chloroform–isoamylalcohol (24:1). Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant (400) transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube, followed by the addition of 400 µl isopropanol. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min and the pellet washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Air-dried pellets were resuspended in 300 µl of sterile water. Each sample was incubated with 2 µl of ribonuclease (RNAse 10 mg ml-1) at 37°C for 1 h. Quality control and quantification of the DNA were performed using dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (only from US851008) was extracted following the protocol described by Zeng and Yang (2002)17 modified by Le Provost et al. (2007).18 Quality control and quantification of RNA samples were performed using a Caliper LabChip XT micro capillary gel electrophoresis (Marshall Scientific, Hampton, USA) and a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), respectively. Libraries were prepared with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) using 1 µg of total RNA, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control of the libraries was performed as previously described. Samples were sequenced at the High-Throughput Sequencing Facility at the University of North Carolina (UNC, USA) using HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, USA).2.2. Genome size estimationLeaves from Solanum lycopersicum cultivar Stupicke, US851008 and IN8482 were processed for Flow Cytometry (FCM) at the Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Cytometry (Federal University of Viçosa, Viçosa, Brazil). Genome size of S. spontaneum was measured from nucleic suspensions prepared as described by Carvalho et al. (2008).19 The suspensions were analysed with a Partec PAS Cytometer (Partec_GmbH, Munster, Germany), equipped with a laser source (488 nm, for 2C value). Solanum lycopersicum was used as standard (2C = 2 pg). FCM parameters (e.g. gain and channel) were determined for each DNA sample based on external FCM analyses of primary standard and sample (data not shown). Each analysis was conducted with three technical replicates, accounting for more than 10,000 nuclei. 2C-value of S. spontaneum was calculated by dividing the mean channel of the G0/G1 fluorescence peak from the primary standard by that of the sample.2.3. PGA pipelinePGA was developed using PERL scripts for running in Linux system and integrates software to read mapping, de novo assembling and scaffolding. In mapping step, reads are split in sub-reads and mapped into the reference loci using Bowtie220 (v. 2.2.1). Assemblies are performed by Trinity software21 (v. 2013-02-25) allowing contigs greater than 500 bp. In the scaffolding steps, L_RNA_scaffolder22 (allowing introns up to 500,000 bp) and BLAT23 (default parameters) are used for scaffolding using reference CDS and RNA sequences. SSPACE24 (v. 2.0) with settings ‘–x 1-o 10 –v 2’ is used for scaffolding using raw DNA-Seq paired-end reads.2.4. PGA validation using T. aestivum genomeTo validate PGA strategy, data from wheat (T. aestivum) were downloaded from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) (Supplementary Table S1). The DNA-Seq reads were assembled with PGA using coverages of 3.6×, 5× and 7× (Supplementary Table S2) and the gene loci from barley (Hordeum vulgare) genome (24,243 sequences)25 as reference. The wheat genes were downloaded from Phytozome26 and compared with PGA assemblies using Exonerate27 (v. 2.2.0) using the following settings ‘–refine region –refineboundary 100 –bestn 1 –percent 20 –quality 20 –geneseed 40 –seedrepeat 10 –minintron 30 –maxintron 500000’.The gene prediction was performed using AUGUSTUS28 (v. 3.2.1) with the following settings ‘–strand=both –genemodel=complete –species=wheat’. The AUGUSTUS results were compared with the wheat Phytozome gene prediction using BLASTn (e-value cutoff off 1e-20) and the ‘No hits’ sequences were selected. Among the ‘No hits’, we call new wheat genes those that met the following criteria: (i) non-aligned into the T. aestivum genome4 with Exonerate27 or, if aligned, lacking another predicted gene for at least 1,000 bp upstream or downstream by the windowBed tool from BEDTools29 (v. 2.17.0); (ii) have a hit in the Uniref90 database,30 using BLASTp (e-value cutoff off 1e-5).2.5. Saccharum spontaneum gene space assemblySaccharum spontaneum DNA-Seq reads (Supplementary Table S3) were assembled by PGA using Sorghum bicolor,31,Zea mays32 and Setaria italica33 genes as reference, chosen based on the phylogenetic distance. The gene space assembly was here referred as ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’. To comparison, S. spontaneum reads were assembled by traditional approach using SOAPdenovo,34 configured to use 73 K-mer, chosen by N50 maximization.2.6. Splicing alignment of S. spontaneum RNA-Seq readsPaired-end and single-end reads from 18 RNA-Seq libraries (leaf, root, internode, node bud and apical meristem) were mapped against ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ using TopHat35 (v. 2.0.9) configured with the settings ‘–i 10 –I 500000 –library type fr-firststrand’. The percentage of mapped reads on each sample is available at Supplementary Table S4. RNA-Seq data from wheat and maize were also mapped against their own reference genomes using software and parameters described above (Supplementary Table S5).2.7. De novo transcriptome assembly and annotationTrinity25 (v. 2013-02-25) was used to perform de novo transcriptome assembly using 18 RNA-Seq libraries using the settings ‘–seqType fq –JM 100G –normalize_reads –normalize_max_read_cov 30’. Larger transcripts from each Trinity component were annotated using BLASTx (e-value cutoff >1e-5) against the Uniref9030 and Swiss-Prot36 databases (Supplementary Table S6).2.8. Saccharum spontaneum gene predictionGene prediction in ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ was refined using the following datasets as extrinsic evidence: (i) 215,681 proteins from plants: 33,012 from great millet (S. bicolor),31 80,713 from maize (Z. mays),32 35,471 from foxtail millet (S. italica),33 39,049 from rice (Oryza sativa)37 and 27,436 from Arabidopsis thaliana38; (ii) 626,769 transcripts from Saccharum spp.: 358,695 from S. spontaneum (Section 4.7) and 268,034 from sugarcane13,39 and (iii) splicing alignments (BAM files) (Section 4.6). Datasets (i) and (ii) were mapped to S. spontaneum genome assembly using Exonerate27 (v. 2.2.0) with the following settings ‘–refine region –refineboundary 100 –bestn 1 –percent 40 –quality 40 –geneseed 40 –seedrepeat 10 –minintron 30 –maxintron 500000’. The Exonerate27 alignments were converted to GFF format with a custom PERL script. The BAM files from dataset (iii) were processed by bam2hints tools, from AUGUSTUS28 package (v. 3.0.1) with the option ‘–intronsonly’, to convert the BAM files to GFF format. A custom PERL script filtered the hints files to retain only evidences of introns supported by three or more read alignments.The prediction of the coding loci was also performed using AUGUSTUS28 trained and configured as ‘–strand=both –genemodel=complete –alternatives-from-evidence=true –gff3 = on’. The training set was formed by 1,000 transcripts fully covered by one protein (the transcript must contains START and STOP codons in the correct position identified through comparison of BLASTx against the Uniref90 database30) from the Trinity21,de novo assembly (Section 4.7). GFF files generated by Exonerate27 and bam2hints programs were used as evidences of exons and introns. Predicted genes were mapped against CDD (Conserved Domain Database) using RPSBLAST and proteins with similarity superior to 30% to transposons (TE) domains were removed our dataset. The filtered gene models were submitted to PASA pipeline40 (v. 2.0.2) to improve the identification of untranslated regions (UTRs) and new splice variants.The confidence of the predicted genes was determined by comparing coding sequences to 626,769 transcripts from Saccharum genus using BLASTn (e-value cutoff <1e-5), with transcripts classified according to the alignment coverage: high confidence (HC; gene alignment coverage =60%). Medium confidence (MC; 30% = alignment coverage =60%) and low confidence (LC; < 30% alignment coverage or no hit). Finally, BUSCO pipeline41 was performed using the plant dataset (Embryophyta odb9) to verify full-length HC proteins and compare their sequences with other homeologues in complex genomes, maize and sugarcane.2.9. Read depth coverageTo identify coverage from the gene regions in ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’, the raw DNA reads (Supplementary Table S3) were compared with the Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 assembly using Bowtie220 (v. 2.2.1) using default parameters. The tools coverage and genomecov from BEDTools29 (v. 2.17.0) were used to extract the read depth coverage from the alignment results (BAM files).2.10. Functional annotation of predicted genesThe functional annotation of predicted S. spontaneum proteins was performed using BLASTp (e-value cutoff <1e-5) against several databases, including Swiss-Prot,36 Uniref9030, NR from NCBI, TAIR38 and CDD. Gene ontology terms association and enrichment analysis were performed using BLAST2GO pipeline.422.11. Comparative genomicsWe used the proteins from assembled genome sequences of five Poaceae species available from the Phytozome v.12 database26: maize (PH207 v1.1),32 great millet (v3.1.1),31 foxtail millet (v2.2),33 rice (v7)37 and purple false brome (Brachypodium distachyon v3.1)43; and bamboo (Phyllostachys heterocycla) (EMBL, accession ERP001340).44 Homeologue gene groups were assigned between those species and S. spontaneum using the Markov clustering algorithm implemented in OrthoMCL.45 Single-copy orthologue (SCO) genes were used to a phylogenetic reconstruction. SCO genes were aligned individually with multiple alignment algorithms implemented in MAFFT46 using the iterative refinement method and WSP and consistency scores (G-INS-i). All alignments were concatenated in a supermatrix for the maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference in RAxML v847 with the GTR+GAMMA model of substitutions and 1,000 bootstrap replicates for branch support. Gene groups with size changes during S. spontaneum evolution were identified by BadiRate48 using the phylogenetic history, providing evolutionary inferences for expansion and retraction of gene families.2.12. Transcript expression calculationThe BAM files from RNA-Seq alignment to ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ were inputted into Cufflinks49 (v. 2.1.1) to produce transcript assemblies, one for each sample. We used the settings ‘–I 500000 –multi-read-correct’ and the GFF file of S. spontaneum gene prediction to guide the assemblies. Subsequently, the cuffmerge/cuffcompare tools merged 18 cufflinks assemblies with the settings ‘–min-isoform-fraction 0.1’. The cuffcompare tool was used to classify the genes into new S. spontaneum isoforms, a transcript in the opposite strand than reference gene and as an intergenic transcript. The raw RNA-Seq reads were aligned against the transcriptome assembly using RSEM50 (v. 1.2.19) with the parameter ‘–strand-specific’ to perform multi-mapping alignments and estimate the expression values for each transcript using RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads).2.13. ncRNA identificationncRNAs were identified in the transcriptome assembly (Section 4.12) assuming four criteria: (i) classified as intergenic or in opposite strand than other transcript; (ii) no hits against NR database from NCBI (BLASTx e-value cutoff <1e-5); (iii) Coding Potential Calculator (CPC)51 score = -1 (although CPC classifies ncRNA as transcripts with values =0, we decided to be more conservative to avoid false positives) and (iv) genomic location larger than 1,000 bp from scaffold tips to avoid partial genes not previously predicted.2.14. Promoter sequences analysisA PERL script was developed to extract the start position of the alignment (first hit) from BLASTp/Uniref9030 output and, then, evaluate whether the predicted genes would be equivalent to complete protein prediction from the database. Because of the low conservation of the signal peptide, a margin of 20 amino acids was allowed at the beginning of each alignment. If the alignment started at up to 20 amino acids after the start codon, the protein beginning was in the correct position. The complete proteins were searched for the presence of at least 2,000 bp upstream of the start codon and those identified were subjected to a tissue-specific analysis using TAU metric.52 TAU scores above 0.95 and RPKM average above 10 were potential candidates for tissue-specific promoters. A list with constitutive promoters was generated by calculating the coefficient of variance (standard deviation/mean) of each gene and it was considered constitutive when that coefficient was below 15%. Standard deviation and mean for each gene was calculated over RPKM values among all tissues.2.15. Saccharum spp. databases comparisonHC genes from S. spontaneum identified in this study were compared with three datasets of sugarcane genes: gene prediction from the sugarcane genome15 (25,316 sequences), SUCEST-FUN12 (43,141 sequences) and ORFeome13 (195,765 sequences) databases using BLASTn (e-value cut-off = 1e-5). ‘No hits’ sequences were selected by a custom PERL script and the annotation from Uniref9030 from each one was selected. The expression profile was subjected to a clustering analysis using Seaborn’s clustermap package from Python.3. Results and discussion3.1. Polyploid Gene AssemblerPGA pipeline works with whole shotgun sequencing data of polyploidy and other complex genomes and focuses on gene assembly, including exons, introns, UTRs and promoters. It performs two main steps: (i) a reference-assisted assembly (here refereed as Reference Loci Assembly) and (ii) a de novo assembly with non-used reads in the first step. The pipeline integrates various software for read mapping, de novo assembling and scaffolding as described in Fig. 1A. PGA can be executed on a desktop machine with RAM memory configured according to the computational power available. Better performance is achieved using a server with at least 16 CPU cores, 64 GB of RAM memory and 500 GB of Hard Disk. Updates, new versions and results from PGA are available at the web site: http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/pga (date last accessed 25 January 2019). PGA pipeline is valuable for any polyploid organism that has phylogenetically close-related species with available complete genome sequences. The PGA pipeline. (A) The three steps of the PGA pipeline are outlined, summarizing the methodology developed in this work. (B) The Reference Loci Assembly step of one locus (Loci 1) is show. Only three sub-reads (ReadA/1.1, ReadA/1.3 and ReadB/1.1) from two read-pairs (A and B) were mapped into the sequence of the Loci 1 (1 and 2), but the pipeline uses the both pairs (whole reads) in the local assembly (3) producing two contigs (4).

(C) Validation of the PGA using sequencing data of T. aestivum.PGA Reference Loci Assembly step. DNA-Seq reads are divided into three overlapping pieces with sizes equal to 50% of the original read size, called sub-reads (Supplementary Fig. S1). The overlap between sub-reads prevents reads with tip differences (mismatches or gaps) from being unmapped, improving alignment rate in low conserved regions or intron–exon junctions from reference. The sub-reads are mapped against a selected reference loci, usually an evolutionary close-related species with available genome data. Reference loci must include exons, introns, UTRs and up to 500 bp upstream and downstream UTRs from one or more species to gene discovery maximization. On this step, PGA can be configured to allow differences (default is up to 10% of gaps or mismatches) between the sub-read and the reference sequence. Full reads corresponding to sub-reads mapped to a locus are retrieved and included in a de novo assembly performed to each locus separately (Fig. 1B). In cases of sub-reads mapping to different loci, the locus with the highest number of occurrences is selected. Original CDS sequences from the reference(s) genome(s) can be used for scaffolding. This step is optional; however, a significant increase in longer contigs is observed (contigs =5,000 bp) (Supplementary Table S7).PGA de novo Loci Assembly and Scaffolding steps. De novo assembly is performed only with reads that were discarded in the first step. Due the complexity of the polyploid genomes, this step generates very fragmented contigs (Supplementary Table S8). Despite that, we consider de novo assembly very important to identify genes that are exclusive in the studied organism. Optionally, is possible to perform a new round of scaffolding using raw DNA-Seq reads applied to de novo assembled contigs and reference-loci assembled contigs. After scaffolding step, it is possible to use RNA assemblies (assembled RNA-Seq or ESTs) to merge contigs. This step is also optional, depending on the availability of transcriptomic data of the organism of interest.PGA uses a transcriptome assembler (Trinity21) instead of traditional genome assembler due to its best performance in comparison with conventional genome assemblers in most of the cases tested (Supplementary Table S9). It happened, probably, because Trinity was developed to support variations of coverage over the locus once it assembles the transcripts generated by alternative splicing events. All traditional genome assemblers, such as SOAPdenovo34 and Velvet,53 are based on concept of uniform coverage, varying only on repetitive regions, and stop the formation of a contig when coverage changes significantly. This concept cannot be applied to polyploid genome, because homeologous chromosomes have regions with low (intergenic) and high (mainly exons) similarities,10 which causes abrupt changes in coverage (Supplementary Fig. S2).The PGA strategy was validated using public available DNA and RNA sequence data (SRA, NCBI, Supplementary Table S1) from T. aestivum subsp. aestivum (bread wheat), a hexaploid species (size of 17 Gb) with high amount of near identical or duplicated sequences4 using three different genome coverages (3.6, 5.0 and 7.7×) (Supplementary Table S2) and H. vulgare (barley) genome as reference 25. A total of 99,386 wheat genes available at Phytozome26 were used for comparison with the PGA scaffolds and resulted in almost 70% identified with up to 80% of alignment coverage (Fig. 1C). In addition, the most part of the partially aligned genes (<80% of alignment) have a very similar sequence but truncated in the borders (Supplementary Fig. S3), i.e. our assembly failed in the beginning or the end of the loci, possibly due the short scaffold sequences. Finally, the PGA assembly with coverage of 3.6× was submitted to gene prediction using AUGUSTUS28 to verify if the pipeline was able to identify new wheat genes. This analysis resulted in a total of 6,378 predicted genes in the PGA assembly that were not identified by the Phytozome26 prediction. From these, 2,032 are probably new wheat genes because match in two criteria: (i) all of them have a BLASTp plant hits against Uniref9030 database; (ii) 171 genes did not align into the T. aestivum genome (Supplementary Fig. S4) and 1,861 genes aligned into genome, but in the intergenic regions, lacking another predicted gene for at least 1,000 bp upstream or downstream (Supplementary Fig. S5). All these genes are new contributions for the complex wheat genome obtained by PGA pipeline using a very low sequencing coverage. The remaining 4,346 could be also real genes, but were discarded because did not match to one or the both criteria used.3.2. Genome sequencing and gene-space assembly of S. spontaneumThere is a large variation in genome size among the varieties of S. spontaneum species (2n = 40–128).11 Therefore, the genome size of two S. spontaneum accessions, US851008 and IN8482, was experimentally estimated by flux cytometry resulting in 9.3 and 11.8 Gb, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). Based on this result, DNA libraries of the smallest genome, i.e. S. spontaneum accession US851008, were sequenced by Illumina technology that produced 60 Gb of 100-bp paired end reads (Supplementary Table S3), representing a low coverage DNA sequencing of 6.4×. In addition, RNA-Seq libraries from leaf, apical meristem, node, bud, internode and root tissues were sequenced and produced around 20 million of 100-bp paired-end reads and 50 million of 100-bp single-end reads per library (Supplementary Table S4).The application of PGA to S. spontaneum reads was performed using three closely related genomes as reference: S. bicolor,31,Z. mays32 and S. italica.33 Based on the phylogenetic distance, the 33,012 S. bicolor loci were used first, followed by 80,713 Z. mays loci and finished with 35,471 S. italica loci. The pipeline was executed for 23 days and used a maximum memory of 60 GB. PGA produced 79,690 scaffolds >1,000 bp and this assembly was here referred as ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’. Despite the ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ represents a high-fragmented draft genome, as observed by the number of sequences (=500 bp) after scaffolding (179,429) and average sequence length (1,597 bp) (Table 1), it was expected that most of the sequences represent different protein-coding genes. To reinforce this hypothesis, the RNA-Seq reads were mapped against ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ resulting in around 70% of matches (Supplementary Table S4), which it is similar value in comparison with wheat (average of 74.3%) and a close value in comparison with maize (average of 84%) (Supplementary Table S5).Summary of three steps of PGA pipeline applied to S. spontaneum, including the Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 assemblySummary of three steps of PGA pipeline applied to S. spontaneum, including the Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 assembly3.3. Gene prediction and annotationA total of 53,436 genes and 59,890 transcripts were predicted on ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ using a combination of software and external evidence using proteins from closely related organisms and transcripts from Saccharum genus (as described in Section 2). The predicted proteins were annotated against public protein databases, resulting in more than 80% and 50% of genes supported by protein hit on the Uniref9030 and Swiss-Prot,36 respectively (Fig. 2A). Also, the predictions were compared with grasses genes indicating high similarity with S. bicolor31 and S. italica33 (Supplementary Fig. S7). The 53,436 predicted genes in Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 were classified considering the alignment coverage with 626,769 transcriptome sequences, resulting in 39,234 HC genes (alignment coverage =60%), 7,322 MC genes (30% = alignment coverage =60%) and 6,880 as LC genes (2,903 genes with an <30% alignment coverage and 3,977 no hits). A summary of the HC genes is shown in Table 2.Saccharum spontaneum gene prediction. (A) Annotation results from all genes against public protein databases.

The analysis included Z. mays32 and Sugarcane proteins.15 A majority (90%) of the 1,440 proteins in the plant BUSCO database was covered by HC proteins, and of these 80% were classified as complete and single copy. This result was similar to the Z. mays and better than Sugarcane proteins (Fig. 2B). Once the BUSCO analysis is based on a small set of single copy orthologous proteins, the completeness of HC proteins was expanded to all annotated proteins (BLASTp against Uniref9030) that were classified based on the alignment coverage: (i) ‘Complete’ predicted gene, when the predicted protein (query) covers very well the database subject (first hit from database); (ii) ‘3' incomplete’ genes, when the predicted protein covers only the begin of database subject; (iii) ‘5' incomplete’ genes, when the predicted protein covers only the final of the database subject and (iv) ‘Fragmented’ genes, when there is partial alignment on both sides. For comparison, the same procedure was performed using predicted proteins from Z. mays32 and T. aestivum4 genomes available at Phytozome,26 chosen for the complex genomes in the grass family. A larger amount of complete predicted genes in S. spontaneum were observed when compared with Z. mays, a largely studied genome, and T. aestivum (Fig. 2C).PGA can assembly gene regions in polyploid organism using low sequencing coverage, because the high level of sequence conservation among homeologous genes increase the sequencing coverage in these regions. To show this effect, we calculated the sequencing coverage over gene regions by alignment of S. spontaneum reads against ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ and counting the read depth for each base pair in that regions (see Section 2). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8, the distributions of read depth by base pair in the gene regions considering all predicted genes have peak at 82×. This new sequencing coverage represents ~12 times the value previously calculated (6.4×) using the whole genome size and, interestingly, near the expected value of ploidy for S. spontaneum.For comparison purposes, the S. spontaneum reads were assembled by conventional strategy using SOAPdenovo34 (Table 3). The SOAPdenovo was executed 12 days and used a maximum memory of 448 GB, 7.5× more memory than PGA. The assembled sequences were submitted for gene prediction using AUGUSTUS28 (trained for S. spontaneum as described previously) that identified 54,658 genes. Despite this number is very similar than that obtained using PGA, the mean size of them (564.1 bp) was smaller than our dataset (53,436 genes with mean size of 840.3 bp). In addition, we performed completeness analysis using BUSCO41 on SOAPdenovo gene prediction that showed a small covered over the BUSCO dataset (34.2%), being the majority fragmented (21.4%). These results reinforce the strategy based on reference-assisted loci that was used.Comparison between S. spontaneum assemblies using PGA and SOAPdenovoComparison between S. spontaneum assemblies using PGA and SOAPdenovoIn summary, the PGA pipeline produced high-quality S. spontaneum sequences focused on gene content in comparison with conventional genome assemblers (Table 3) and with other published complex genomes (Fig. 2). The high-coverage sequencing over the gene regions, the use of transcriptome assembler and the criteria chosen for sequence selection (see Section 2) generated a representative sequence for each locus, avoiding erroneous duplication of homeologous alleles, that can be observed by low values of duplicated proteins (2.8%) in BUSCO41 analysis.3.4. Comparative genome and gene family analysisFrom the total of 39,234 HC genes predicted for S. spontaneum, 23,707 was clustered into gene families with genes from at least one other species and 15,527 genes were not assigned to any family and, thus, considered orphans (Fig. 3). SCOs appeared in 5,500 clusters that were used to infer the phylogeny in Fig. 3. Phylogenetic inference of the relationships among Poaceae species was compared with S. spontaneum. Phylogeny was obtained by Maximum Likelihood analysis using a concatenated matrix of the 5,500 single-copy gene families obtained in OrthoMCL. All branches got total support (100%) for the 1,000 bootstraps used. The total number of genes and the orphan genes for each species is on the right-side table. For each branch in phylogeny a pie chart reflects the proportion of gene gains and losses estimated in BadiRate analysis. The size of the pie charts reflects the absolute number of genes gained or lost for all families in that current or ancestral lineage.Phylogenetic inference of the relationships among Poaceae species was compared with S. spontaneum.

The size of the pie charts reflects the absolute number of genes gained or lost for all families in that current or ancestral lineage.Saccharum spontaneum showed a high amount of orphan genes, like Z. mays e O. sativa, and 80% of them were assembled in the de novo step of our pipeline showing the importance of this step to reconstruct species-specific genes. Orphan genes represent genes that are in either a neutral process of pseudogenization or an adaptive process of evolutionary novelties of the lineage. Many orphan genes in plants have been reported as evolutionary novelties related to environmental stress response and species-specific traits54 and the large amount of orphan genes in S. spontaneum may be also related to traits selected during domestication. We evaluated the gene expression profile of the orphan genes and 52.5% have RPKM >= 3 in at least one RNA-Seq libraries, being 31.8% with highly expression values (RPKM >= 10). In addition, the most of 15,527 genes (53.3%) have similarity with the gene prediction from sugarcane (BLASTn, e-value cutoff of 1e-10) with some of them covering more than 90% of the sugarcane gene, such as: SS46658 (annotated as Peroxidase), SS21041 (annotated as Alpha-galactosidase) and SS4010 (annotated as transcriptional factor).A total of 29,268 gene families with two or more genes were obtained, revealing 14,965 gene families with recent paralogues in at least one species, 138 families with recent paralogues exclusive to S. spontaneum, summing up 143 new duplication events in S. spontaneum: 133 duplications and 5 triplications (Supplementary Table S10). We also found 238 exclusive or expanded (or exclusive/expanded) gene families from S. spontaneum, with ~95% representing unknown-domain protein or no hits in blast searches against NR/NCBI database (Supplementary Table S11). We detected expression in 122 out of 167 genes among no hits families in at least one RNA-Seq library, which indicates that those families are not artefacts of the technique.Expansions and retractions of gene families, analysed using phylogeny and the birth and death models, were used to calculate rates of gain and loss of genes through evolution (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S11). In general, Poaceae species showed a higher gene gain than loss, with absolute numbers varying from 5,000 to 10,000 genes for each lineage. All ancestral lineages showed a lower amount of both gain and loss, suggesting that the current lineages have higher gene innovations. Those patterns of innovation may be associated with the domestication history of each crop. The highest proportion of gains was found within the grass clade, grouping S. spontaneum, S. bicolor, Z. mays and S. italica.A total of 37 gene families were expanded in S. spontaneum when compared with its ancestral lineages. Most of them (30) were classified as no hits, unknown function, mobile element or ribosomal related in blast searches against NR/NCBI databases, although expression evidence was found in the RNA-Seq data. Three families were selected as promising candidates of expansion in S. spontaneum due to the number of genes, sequence completeness and agronomical relevance: leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) family (ORTHOMCL0, 35 putative evolutionary novelties out of 61 genes), GRAS-domain protein family (ORTHOMCL18, 9 out of 26) and callose synthase (CalS) family (ORTHOMCL23, 12 out of 19) (Supplementary Figs S9 and S10; Table S12).The LRR-RLK and GRAS domain are multigene and complex gene families, regulating many features in plant growth and development and stress response. LRR-RLK family encodes cell surface receptors responsible for cell–cell and cell–environment communication, affecting axillary and shoot apical meristem (SAM), tillering and brassinosteroid signalling pathway.55 Whereas, GRAS domain protein family modulates shoot and root development, through gibberellin and light signal transduction, axillary meristem initiation, SAM maintenance and root radial patterning.56 Recently, ScGAI, a GRAS protein and hormonal hub from sugarcane, was found in SAM and elongating internodes, implicated in shoot-root ratio modulation and tillering.57 Although difficult to devise gene function through phylogeny, the LRR-RLK and GRAS domain gene novelties from S. spontaneum showed on average higher gene expression levels in node and/or buds (axillary meristem) (Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating a potential role in initial growth development, coherently with the species capacity for intense tillering and faster culm development.Callose, a minor cell wall polymer, is usually associated with specialized tissues (cell plate during cytokinesis, vascular system, pollen and pollen tube formation and plasmodesmata) and response to pathogen and herbivore attacks.58 Although composed mainly of cellulose, callose is found in significant amounts in cell walls of energy crops, such as maize and Miscanthus x giganteus (up to 5%) leaves, in which callose fibrils intertwined in cellulose forms an atypical outer layer.58 Callose-enriched biomass is a new target for biotechnological engineering resulting in significant increase in second generation ethanol yield using an optimized system of enzymes and yeast.59 In this study, putative CalS gene novelties were ubiquitously and highly expressed (RPKM values from 103 to 174; Supplementary Fig. S11) in all tissues evaluated and might represent new and interesting targets for sugarcane and energy cane breeding.3.5. Reference transcriptome assemblyThe transcriptome assembly was produced using the Cufflinks49 package using Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 as the reference. As a result, 156,531 transcripts were identified with a length >200 bp. The comparison between the reference and de novo transcriptome assembly, shown in Supplementary Table S13, reveals that a set of higher quality sequences is constructed when the ‘Saccharum spontaneum 1.0’ is used to guide the transcriptome assembly. The transcriptome assembly using our reference genome proved to return high-quality and more informative data, with longer transcripts and ORFs, and more hits against Swiss-Prot.36 In addition, there is high concordance in gene structure, such as exon–intron junctions and intron length, between gene predictions and splicing alignments of RNA-Seq reads, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S12.In addition to improving the quality of the transcripts, the use of Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 allows the identification of candidates for isoforms and long non-coding RNAs. For that the transcripts identified as a transcript in the opposite strand than reference gene (5,566) and as an intergenic (41,931) by the cuffcompare were submitted to the ncRNA identification. A total of 3,178 transcripts (mean size: 624 bp) could be assigned as non-coding (2,822 bigger than 200 bp, i.e. lncRNAs) (Supplementary Table S14). As expected, those transcripts have little expression values, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S13, in all RNA-Seq samples around 50% of non-coding RNAs have RPKM > 1 and around 20% have RPKM > 3.3.6. Promoter sequencesPGA pipeline can extend the scaffold sequences upstream from the gene, providing information on the promoter regions that can be used for many biotechnology applications. The use of constitutive or tissue-specific promoters is essential to carry out studies to investigate plant metabolism under defined conditions. Moreover, the use of right promoter to express heterologous proteins in a controlled condition and specific tissues is mandatory for the development of genetically modified varieties.In this study, a total of 3,108 promoter regions were identified considering at least 2,000 bp upstream from the beginning of the gene. The initial positions of predicted genes were verified by alignment against Uniref90 database (see Section 2). These promoter regions were classified according to their respective gene expression profiles (constitutive or tissue-specific) and intensities: weak (10 < RPKM < 100) and strong (RPKM >= 100). A summary of the promoter regions identified is shown in Table 4 and reveals that the most represented group is formed by constitutive promoters (Supplementary File S1) and there are many interesting tissue-specific promoters distributed among leaf (Supplementary File S2), root (Supplementary File S3), node (Supplementary File S4), bud (Supplementary File S5) and apical meristem (Supplementary File S6).Summary of the S. spontaneum promoter regions (=2,000 bp upstream from the gene) classified by gene expression profile and intensitySummary of the S. spontaneum promoter regions (=2,000 bp upstream from the gene) classified by gene expression profile and intensity3.7. Comparison with sugarcane databasesTo identify S. spontaneum genes that were not described previously, we compared the HC genes produced by Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 with the genes from the Sugarcane genome15 (25,316 sequences) and the transcriptome sequences from SUCEST-FUN12 (43,141 sequences) and ORFeome13 (195,765 sequences) (Fig. 4A), resulting in 1,913 genes that were identified only in our assembly (Supplementary Table S15). From those genes, 536 have known functions with proteins already characterized in other plants (mainly monocots), 502 were classified as hypothetical proteins, and 926 were no hits (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the expression values of the 1,913 genes in S. spontaneum (Fig. 4B), show distinct pattern across the selected tissues (apical meristem, lateral bud, internode, node, leaf and root). New contributions for sugarcane databases.

(A) Results from the comparison of Saccharum spontaneum 1.0 assemble against Sugarcane databases (Gene prediction from sugarcane genome, SUCEST-FUN and ORFeome) and (B) the expression pattern of new identified genes in different tissues.Saccharum spontaneum is one of the most robust grasses, having a high tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, mainly drought resistance and the ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils.9 Remarkable, from the genes presenting high expression values (=50 FPKM), several are involved in stress response and 135 new genes were identified in roots. The ability to cope with several stresses of S. spontaneum could be a consequence of its large and dense root system when compared with S. officinarum and the commercial varieties of sugarcane, which make possible the soil exploitation and the higher uptake of water and nutrients. In addition, several genes could be related to symbiosis establishment (Table 5), recently described to increased drought resistance of S. spontaneum.66 Among those genes, we can highlight genes related to recognition and early steps of symbiosis establishment (SS34074, SS37878, SS50399); stress and disease response (SS11486, SS38841, SS35410, SS41259) and cell wall degradation (SS48435); electron transfer and primary metabolism (SS35024, SS38176). Genes coding for nutrient transporter between fungus and plant were also identified (SS28265, SS11782, SS31510, SS13699), although they were already annotated in SUCEST-FUN12 and ORFeome13 databases.Probable symbiosis-related genes expressed in S. spontaneum rootsSS34074SS37878SS503996.662.882.04SS38841SS32869SS3541020.1316.062.38SS15872SS420993.562.01SS48435SS465912.921.09SS34074SS37878SS503996.662.882.04SS38841SS32869SS3541020.1316.062.38SS15872SS420993.562.01SS48435SS465912.921.09Probable symbiosis-related genes expressed in S. spontaneum rootsSS34074SS37878SS503996.662.882.04SS38841SS32869SS3541020.1316.062.38SS15872SS420993.562.01SS48435SS465912.921.09SS34074SS37878SS503996.662.882.04SS38841SS32869SS3541020.1316.062.38SS15872SS420993.562.01SS48435SS465912.921.09Between other new genes, expressed exclusively in roots cells, we identified one corresponding to a Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) (SS1022; 28.01 ± 4.12 RPKM). Characterized as a hydrophilic protein widely distributed in the plant kingdom, LEA is accumulated in vegetative tissues as a response to water limitation due to salinity, drought or high temperatures.67 Other significant genes annotated by our analysis and expressed only in S. spontaneum roots are the BURP domain-containing genes, specifically; those related to families 10 and 13 (BURP10 and BURP13). BURP domain-containing genes are related to many functions in plants, in O. sativa, the BURP10 was reposted to be highly expressed in roots at the tillering stage.68 Our results also demonstrated the expression of BURP10 (SS23435) in roots tissue (around 17.23 ± 3.12 RPKM), suggesting that this gene could be responsible for the dense root system and tillering potential described in S. spontaneum.4. ConclusionsEven with large advances in the sequencing technologies, the assembly of complex genomes still represents a bottleneck, mainly due to polyploidy and high heterozygosity. The development of new bioinformatics efforts can contribute to overcoming these constraints, especially, for complete genomes of the closely related organism, in which the methods based on reference assembly can be applied. Using the PGA pipeline, we provided a high-quality assembly of gene regions in the T. aestivum and S. spontaneum, proving that PGA can be more efficient than conventional genome assemblers in cases of complex genomes and using low coverage DNA sequencing. The low memory requirement by PGA in comparison with de novo assembly strategy is also an advantage. Our findings of S. spontaneum genome highlighted for the first time the molecular basis of some noteworthy features of this biomass, like the high productivity and the resistance face biotic and abiotic stress. Those results can be employed in future functional and genetic studies beyond supporting the development of new varieties of sugarcane for the agronomic industry.Availability of dataThe DNA and RNA Illumina reads were submitted to SRA (Sequence Read Archive) from NCBI under BioProject accession number PRJNA474618.

IntroductionUrodele amphibian newts have an outstanding history as model organisms in experimental biology. The ‘Spemann organizer’ was discovered using European newts, Triturus cristatus and T. taeniatus.1 ‘Wolffian lens regeneration’ was discovered using these species,2 and Eguchi et al., subsequently demonstrated transdifferentiation of pigment epithelial cells to lens cells by clonal cell culture using the Japanese common newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster.3 Newts have provided the clearest examples of natural reprogramming events in the process of lens regeneration, facilitating the study of mechanisms of cellular reprogramming.4–8 Additionally, experiments with newts have yielded a great deal of knowledge about the regeneration of various tissues and organs, including limb,9 joint,10 heart,11 jaw,12 retina,13,14 brain,15–17 spinal cord,18 intestine,19 testis,20,21 and lung.22 Among vertebrates, only newts are known to be capable of regenerating all of the above-mentioned organs and body parts. Furthermore, comparative studies of regeneration ability in newts and frogs have provided new insights for future regenerative medicine, given that frogs (like mammals) lose the ability to regenerate various tissues and organs after metamorphosis.10,12,23,24Newts also have been employed in research other than that on regeneration, reflecting these animals’ unique biological properties. The genome sizes of newt species are 8–10 times larger (e.g. Axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum: 32 Gb) than the human genome (3 Gb).24–26 Newts are tumour-resistant, despite having a long lifetime.27,28 Newt eggs are fertilized via physiological polyspermy.29 Male newts can form new testes even after sexual maturation.30 Moreover, the mating behaviour of newts is mediated by sexual pheromones.31,32 Furthermore, several groups have shown the utility of newts for the toxicity testing of chemical compounds.33–35 Indeed, aquatic tetrapods like newts can serve as important indicators of the influence of chemical compounds on the environment.36 Therefore, newts are versatile model animals that can be used in various fields of research, including regeneration, stem cell biology, cancer research, developmental biology, reproductive biology, evolution, ethology, and toxico-genomics.Although these properties make newts attractive model animals, the newt species that have been used (e.g. the American common newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, and the Japanese common newt, C. pyrrhogaster) in classic experiments are not suitable for reverse or molecular genetics because of the difficulty of breeding these species in captivity. For example, Japanese common newts spawn seasonally, and each female spawns only a small number of eggs per cycle.37,38 Under typical conditions, three or more years can be required for sexual maturation. Several different newt species have been used for studies performed across different laboratories, countries, and continents, making it difficult for members of this research community to share resources and expertise. In fact, it is estimated that the American common newt and the Japanese common newt diverged 150 million years ago,39 an evolutionary distance that results in substantial differences between the two species.24The Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl) is an emerging model newt.24,40 In contrast to conventional newt species, P. waltl has high fecundity and is easy to maintain in the laboratory. P. waltl newts have a relatively short generation time, and females of this species spawn a large number of eggs all year around in the laboratory compared with the conventional newts (e.g. C. pyrrhogaster). Using P. waltl newts, we have established a model experimental system that is amenable to molecular genetics.40 Notably, efficient genome editing was recently demonstrated in P. waltl.41,42 Despite the availability of these tools, limited genetic information is available for this species. Recently, Elewa et al. reported a draft sequence for the P. waltl genome, which is 20 Gb in size, along with the corresponding transcriptome.24 These data provided pioneering resources for the P. waltl newt research field. However, assembly data or gene models are not publicly available for this species; there remains a popular demand for a reference gene catalogue that can be openly shared among researchers who are interested in this emerging model newt.In the present study, we sought to create a reference set of comprehensive gene models for P. waltl. To that end, we prepared 29 libraries of mRNA from various tissues and embryonic stages of P. waltl and subjected the libraries to RNA-seq. We combined the resulting >1.2 billion reads and assembled these reads. This assembly yielded 1,395,387 contigs and permitted the annotation of 202,788 predicted ORFs. Using these data, we built a reference set of gene models of P. waltl providing good coverage of P. waltl protein-coding genes. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression patterns of regeneration-, developmental stage-, and tissue-specific genes could be analysed using our gene model and transcriptome data sets. Furthermore, we have established a portal website that provides the research community with access to our data sets.2. Materials and Methods2.1. AnimalsThe P. waltl newts used in this study originated from a breeding colony at Tottori University. The animals were maintained as described previously.40 The developmental stages (St) were categorized according to criteria described by Shi and Boucaut.43 To isolate organs or perform surgical operations for limb and heart regeneration, embryos and adults were anaesthetized/euthanized by immersion in 0.01–0.2% MS-222 (tricaine; Sigma-Aldrich, MO). All procedures were carried out in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the respective institutes and with the national guidelines of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science & Technology of Japan.2.2. RNA preparation, library construction, and RNA sequencingSequence data collection was performed in five laboratories. We here describe a representative workflow used in preparing the libraries from gonadal tissues and unfertilized eggs. Minor modifications were made for the other libraries (see Supplementary Table S1 for details). Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA.) and purified by NucleoSpin kits (Takara Bio, Siga, Japan), following the respective manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing libraries were generated using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) starting from 1.0 µg total RNA for each sample, according to manufacturer’s protocol (Low Throughput Protocol) with minor modifications: RNA fragmentation was conducted for 4 min instead of 8 min at 94 °C and the number of PCR cycles was reduced to seven to minimize PCR biases. In total, eight multiplexed libraries were sequenced per lane using a Hiseq1500 system (Illumina) with 106-bp paired-end readings in the RapidRun mode.Summary of the sample preparation and sequence profilesAbbreviations correspond to the labels in Table 1, Figs 3, 5, and 7 and Supplementary Figs S2 and S3.The developmental stages were categorized according to criteria described by Shi and Boucaut.43#, paired end.Summary of the sample preparation and sequence profilesAbbreviations correspond to the labels in Table 1, Figs 3, 5, and 7 and Supplementary Figs S2 and S3.The developmental stages were categorized according to criteria described by Shi and Boucaut.43#, paired end.2.3. Assembly and ORF predictionAll sequenced reads were employed for de novo assembly using the Trinity program ver. 2.4.044 under default parameter settings; the trimming option was performed using the trimmomatic software.45 Assembled contigs were processed using the TransDecoder program ver. 3.0.146 to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and amino acid sequences; the parameter of ‘minimum protein length’ was set to 50 amino acids (default: 100) to preclude overlooking short-length proteins such as neuropeptides and antimicrobial peptides. We also used the BLASTP and Pfam options in the TransDecoder ORF prediction. Redundant ORFs were filtered using the CD-HIT program.47 The quality of the assembly was evaluated using the BUSCO program ver. 248 to compare the newt transcriptome assembly against a core-vertebrate gene (CVG) data set49 and a vertebrate data set (Vertebrata_odb9).2.4. Gene annotation and ortholog analysisWe searched predicted amino acid sequences derived from the newt transcriptome for homologs of previously published protein sequences using a BLASTP search against the NCBI non-redundant database (nr DB) (parameters: BLAST+ ver. 2.6.0; the nr DB was the latest version as of 23 November 2017). Gene ontology (GO) terms for each sequence were also annotated using the BLAST2GO program (Version 4.1.9) with the NCBI nr DB.50 To identify orthologs of each P. waltl protein-coding gene, orthologous groups within vertebrates were inferred using the OrthoFinder2 program (version 2.0.0).51 We carried out two different orthologous clustering analyses. First, we compared P. waltl proteomes with those of nine other vertebrates: green anole (Anolis carolinensis), zebrafish (Danio rerio), chicken (Gallus gallus), human (Homo sapiens), coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), mouse (Mus musculus), Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), and western clawed frog (X. tropicalis). All of the protein sequences were downloaded from OrthoDB ver. 9.1, except that the X. laevis sequences were obtained from Xenbase ver. 9.1 (http://www.xenbase.org/other/static/ftpDatafiles.jsp). Second, we performed a pairwise comparison between the P. waltl and axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) transcriptomes.522.5. Expression and network analysisWe quantified expression of each gene in each sample by mapping to the reference transcript database that was created by the de novo assembly (see above). The kallisto program v0.43.1 with 100 bootstrap replicates was used for quantifying abundance of the transcripts.53 The read count data were normalized by the trimmed mean M values (TMM) method available in the edgeR software package of R language software (version 3.12.1).54 After TMM normalization, we estimated the Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Million mapped reads (RPKM) value of each gene. We used the RPKM values for the gene network analysis. To visualize profiles of gene expressions, a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot was generated using the edgeR software package.To detect modules of co-expressed genes from the transcriptome data, Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied. Normalized RPKM data were used for this analysis, implemented in the WGCNA library (version 1.66)55 of R language. Genes expressed at low levels, and genes with low expression variance across the libraries, were filtered out; the 16,367 surviving gene models were used in the WGCNA analysis. A signed network was constructed in WGCNA with specific parameter settings of power = 8, networkType = ‘signed’, TOMType = ‘unsigned’, and minModuleSize = 30.2.6. Identification of bmp2/4/16To identify P. waltl bmp genes and infer phylogeny of this gene family among vertebrates, the corresponding predicted protein sequences were used to search the genome database as described below. We searched the Ensembl database version 9156 to identify bmp2/4/16 homologs in eight vertebrate species, including A. carolinensis, D. rerio, G. gallus, H. sapiens, L. chalumnae, M. musculus, Oryzias latipes, and Takifugu rubripes; the X. tropicalis ver. 9.1 gene model in the Xenbase also was searched.57 Additionally, we searched three independent amphibian-specific data sets that were described in previous reports, including those for Nanorana parkeri,58,A. mexicanum,52 and C. pyrrhogaster.59 Homologous sequences encoded by bmp2/4/16 genes were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm with default settings in the MEGA7 software (see Supplementary Data S1).60,61 A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis implemented in MEGA7 with the JTT model and gamma distribution. Bootstrap probabilities were computed using 1,000 replicates.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Collection and preparation of materialWe sought to create a comprehensive transcriptome reference covering the P. waltl gene repertoire, in the hope that the resulting database will be useful for various subsequent studies. Therefore, we collected RNA samples from a wide variety of tissues and developmental stages (and Table 1). The 29 resulting libraries were derived from 12 different normal tissues (heart, limb, tail, brain, kidney, liver, pancreas, intestine, testicular connective tissue, testicular gland, testis, and ovary) and two regenerating tissues (heart and limb) of adult newts, and from whole embryos at each of nine time points from early to late developmental stages (unfertilized egg and stages 7–7.5, 8b, 11, 12, 15, 18, 25, and 30). 3.2. Sequencing and de novo assembly of transcriptomeWe sequenced the 29 libraries, each of which yielded 24 million to 65 million paired-end reads of 100 to 125 bases each, totalling >1.2 billion reads. To build a reference P. waltl transcriptome, cleaned reads from all of these libraries were assembled together using Trinity, yielding 1,395,387 contigs with an average length and N50 of 700.56 and 1,490 bp, respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). From these contigs, we predicted 202,788 non-redundant ORFs, ranging from 147 to 73,080 bp with an N50 of 591 bp (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). The ORF set was designated PLEWA04_ORF and used as a reference P. waltl coding-sequence catalogue for downstream analysis.Overview of de novo assembly and ORF predictionAnalysed using Vertebrata_odb9.Including 1% of fragmented.Overview of de novo assembly and ORF predictionAnalysed using Vertebrata_odb9.Including 1% of fragmented.We evaluated the completeness of our transcriptome by comparison (via the BUSCO program) with two different datasets (CVG and Vertebrata_odb9). The CVG data consists of 233 genes that are shared as one-to-one orthologs among 29 representative vertebrate genomes and are widely used for phylogenomic studies.39 We found that our P. waltl transcriptome covered all 233 CVG genes, indicating that we successfully reconstructed most of the protein-coding gene sequences in this species. In addition, our P. waltl transcriptome corresponded to 98% of the Vertebrata_odb9 gene set. We compared our result with earlier urodele transcriptome studies. Previous P. waltl and A. mexicanum transcriptomes covered 82% and 88% of the Vertebrata_odb9 data, respectively.24,52 Thus, our P. waltl transcriptome data significantly enhanced the gene space of urodeles, attaining a near-complete gene repertoire.3.3. Gene annotation and ortholog analysisAll translated sequences of PLEWA04_ORF were compared with the NCBI non-redundant protein database (nr DB) using BLASTP. Among the 202,788 ORFs identified in our DB, 121,837 genes (60.1%) encoded proteins exhibiting sequence similarity to proteins in the NCBI nr DB (Supplementary Data S2). The two most-frequent BLASTP top-hit species corresponded to clawed frogs (X. tropicalis and X. laevis), followed by coelacanth (L. chalumnae) and turtles (C. picta, P. sinensis, and C. mydas) (Table 3), which reasonably reflects the phylogenetic position of P. waltl among these species.Species of top BLAST hits in NCBI nr databases for the P. waltl transcriptomeSpecies of top BLAST hits in NCBI nr databases for the P. waltl transcriptomeWe used InterProScan to query the predicted coding regions for known functional domains. We identified 90,471 Pfam motifs (Supplementary Data S3) in the products of 55,075 P. waltl gene models. In addition, 814,803 GO terms were assigned to 86,516 genes (42.7%) (Supplementary Data S4).Organs and embryos used for RNA preparation. Panel (A) provides a picture of a whole adult female.

Scale bars: 1 mm.To understand gene repertoire evolution in the P. waltl proteome, we generated clusters of orthologous and paralogous gene families comparing the P. waltl proteome with those of nine other vertebrates (Table 4). The OrthoFinder program identified 18,559 orthogroups consisting of 215,304 genes. The P. waltl gene models were clustered into 15,923 orthogroups, among which 13,283 and 14,183 groups were shared with H. sapiens and X. laevis, respectively (Table 4 and Fig. 2). We found 660 orthologous groups, consisting of 2,958 gene models that are unique to P. waltl; these loci presumably represent evolutionarily young genes that have undergone considerable divergence following gene duplications. These lineage-specific genes might account for the traits unique to P. waltl. Additionally, we found 784 orthologous groups that are shared only among amphibians (P. waltl, and X. tropicalis).Venn diagram of shared and unique orthogroups in five vertebrates.

We compared our P. waltl transcriptome with that of axolotl and identified 22,907 orthologous groups from the pairwise comparison. These two species shared 22,307 orthologous groups, while retaining 321 and 279 species-specific groups, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). In both organisms, these species-specific groups often contained LINE elements. Previous reports have shown that LINE elements are abundant in urodele amphibian genomes.24,26,62 Genes containing LINE elements may have evolved more rapidly, accumulating lineage-specific mutations as a result of retrotransposition events.3.4. Gene co-expression pattern analysisWe quantified gene expression and profiled the expression patterns across all of the samples examined. A MDS plot of the 29 samples was used to depict the transcriptome similarities among the samples (Fig. 3). Samples derived from differentiated tissues/organs of adults (red dots in Fig. 3) yielded transcriptomes that were clearly distinct from those of samples from developing embryos (blue dots in Fig. 3). Samples at similar developmental stages clustered closer to each other than to those of differentiated tissues/organs; samples derived from the amputation experiments clustered on the MDS plot based on the amputated tissue. Notably, directional distances on the dimension-2 axis indicated a continuum in the direction of changes that was consistent with developmental progression. Specifically, the embryonic samples were clearly ordered along the dimension-2 axis from unfertilized egg to gastrula (St 7–12), neurula (St 15–18), and tailbud stage (St 25–28), implying that gene expression gradually changes with progression during embryogenesis.

This unsupervised and unbiased analysis identified distinct co-expression modules corresponding to clusters of correlated transcripts (Fig. 4). WGCNA identified 19 co-expressed modules from the expression data spanning 29 samples; each module contained 58 to 3,585 co-expressed genes (Fig. 5). Each module represents genes with highly correlated expression profiles, either in a single tissue or in a narrow window of developmental stages. Out of 19 modules, 11 represent a tissue-specific pattern in the adult tissues: the modules indicated by different colours represent different tissues (green, lightgreen, tan, light yellow, black, pink, red, grey60, purple, blue, and brown for heart-, tail-, brain-, kidney-, liver-, pancreas-, intestine-, testicular connective tissue-, testicular gland-, adult testis-, and ovary-specific expression patterns, respectively) (Fig. 5A). Four modules were embryonic (Fig. 5B). The turquoise module was composed of 3,585 genes whose expression was observed only in unfertilized eggs, representing maternal transcripts that functioned in the early stages during P. waltl embryogenesis. Indeed, some genes such as those encoding daz-like protein (M0089929_PLEWA04), ddx25 (Dead south) (M0209664_PLEWA04), and nanos1 (M0208351_PLEWA04), which are known to be expressed maternally in Xenopus or other amphibians, are included in the turquoise module.63,64 On the other hand, modules indicated in cyan, yellow, and midnightblue exhibit zygotic expression after the mid-blastula transition (MBT; St 6–7), representing a progressive pattern showing peaks at St 8b–12 (early), St 15–18 (middle), and St 30 (late), respectively. In the regeneration experiments, limb-enriched genes were clustered into three modules based on a pattern corresponding to the responsiveness to amputation treatment: genes designated in greenyellow, magenta, and lightcyan showed peaks at 0-, 3-, and 19-day post-amputation (dpa), respectively (Fig. 5C).

The sample abbreviations indicated by labels at the bottom of each panel are defined in Fig. 3 legend.3.5. Major signalling pathwaysCell signalling pathways are essential for embryogenesis and organogenesis and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We inspected the gene repertoire of major signal-factor encoding genes and analysed the corresponding expression patterns at the various developmental stages. Specifically, the following genes (or gene families) were surveyed: wingless-type MMTV integration site (wnt) family (Supplementary Fig. S2A), fibroblast growth factor (fgf) (Supplementary Fig. S2B), hedgehog (hh) (Supplementary Fig. S2C), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) (Supplementary Fig. S2D), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (igfbp) (Supplementary Fig. S2E). This analysis demonstrated that the repertoire of signalling genes of P. waltl is typical for vertebrates, but we found a few cases of urodele amphibian-specific gene duplications and potential losses.The wnt gene family set is conserved in P. waltl as in other vertebrates. However, we detected two additional paralogous genes encoding Wnt ligands, wnt11b and wnt7-like (Supplementary Fig. S2A); we postulate that these additional loci were generated by duplication in the lineage leading to P. waltl. In vertebrates, six highly conserved igfbp family genes are typically observed, and P. waltl has all six igfbp orthologous genes (Supplementary Fig. S2E), while Xenopus lacks igfbp3 and igfbp6 orthologs.65Orthologs of bmp2 and bmp16 were identified in the transcriptome of P. waltl, while the bmp4 ortholog was not found. Furthermore, no orthologs of bmp4 were identified in the genome and/or transcriptomes of two other urodeles, A. mexicanum, and C. pyrrhogaster (Fig. 6), suggesting a possible loss of bmp4 in the urodele lineage, although further genome-based investigation is required. The bmp16 gene was thought to be confined solely to teleost fish species.66 However, we found bmp16 in this urodele, consistent with results recently reported in coelacanths and reptiles.67 Thus, our phylogenetic analysis suggested that urodeles and anurans have lost bmp4 and bmp16, respectively, in each lineage. Phylogenetic tree of bmp2/4/16 genes among vertebrates. This phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using 34 vertebrate orthologs, including 12 bmp4, 16 bmp2, and 7 bmp16 genes; 2 ascidian bmp2/4 genes were used as the outgroup. The number at each node represents the bootstrap probability.Phylogenetic tree of bmp2/4/16 genes among vertebrates. This phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using 34 vertebrate orthologs, including 12 bmp4, 16 bmp2, and 7 bmp16 genes; 2 ascidian bmp2/4 genes were used as the outgroup. The number at each node represents the bootstrap probability.In summary, most of the orthologous genes for major signalling molecules were identified in P. waltl, which therefore harbours a gene repertoire typical of vertebrates, with a few exceptions. The expression patterns of the signalling molecule-encoding genes of P. waltl in some instances differed from those of Xenopus species. Further research on these differences is expected to expand our understanding of the evolution and development of amphibians.3.6. Hox genes and their expression dynamics during embryogenesisIn tetrapod genomes, approximately 40 hox genes are present and organized into four hox clusters. hoxd12 has not been identified in any amphibians, while the hoxc3 gene is retained.68 No hoxc1 ortholog has been identified in amphibians, with the exception of caecilians.69 The genomes of the diploid X. tropicalis and the allotetraploid X. laevis harbour 38 and 75 functional hox genes, respectively.70 In this study, we identified 37 hox gene orthologs in the P. waltl transcriptome data (Fig. 7). Expression profile of hox genes during oogenesis and embryogenesis. A total of 37 hox genes are listed from the assembly data of PLEWA04. The sample abbreviations indicated by the labels at the top of each panel are defined in Table 1. Ovaries were sampled at three and seven months after metamorphosis (Ov3 and Ov7, respectively). Note that P. waltl hoxc1, and hoxd12 orthologs were not identified from our transcriptome data. A hoxb13 ortholog was not confidently identified; the candidate contig (M1173232_PLEWA04) showed low homology compared with other vertebrates (Supplementary Data S5 and S6Author Webpage). Most of the hox genes were zygotically activated; only the hoxd1 mRNA was synthesized during oogenesis and stored at the one-cell stage. RPKM values of each gene are indicated as a colour gradient on a log2 scale, ranging from red (maximum) to white (minimum).Expression profile of hox genes during oogenesis and embryogenesis.

RPKM values of each gene are indicated as a colour gradient on a log2 scale, ranging from red (maximum) to white (minimum).The expression profile of the P. waltl hox genes during embryogenesis was similar to those of axolotl and Xenopus, suggesting that the regulation of this gene family is conserved among amphibians (Fig. 7).68,70 Anterior hox genes were activated starting around the time of the MBT; posterior hox genes were gradually up-regulated at the late embryonic stage, reflecting their spatio-temporal collinearity during embryogenesis. Interestingly, hoxd1 of P. waltl was found to be stored as a maternal mRNA at the oocyte and one-cell stage (Fig. 7), whereas the orthologous genes are expressed after MBT in axolotl and Xenopus.68,70,71Newt genomic gigantism has been interpreted to suggest that the genome of a prototypical newt underwent species-specific whole genome duplication. Because hox genes are maintained as highly conserved gene clusters in vertebrate genomes, the number of hox clusters usually reflects the number of whole-genome duplications each genome experienced during evolution.72 In our P. waltl gene repertoire, we only found one-to-one orthologs of hox genes when comparing among available amphibian genes. This result suggested that the newt genome did not undergo additional whole-genome duplication. Similarly, the recently published axolotl giant genome showed no evidence for additional whole-genome duplication; instead, the axolotl genome has a correspondingly enlarged genic component, primarily due to the presence of especially long introns.24,26,73 In the salamander genome, expansion of LTR retrotransposons also contributes to genome gigantism.74 Such mechanisms also may have contributed to newt genome gigantism and may be related to the incredible regenerative ability of this species.3.7. Transcriptomic features of regenerating limbsNumerous developmental pathway genes have been reported to be reactivated during limb regeneration. For example, hox13-paralogous genes are expressed in distal regions of developing and regenerating amphibian limbs.75–78 Indeed, the present work confirmed the reactivation of the hoxa/c/d13 genes in regenerating P. waltl forelimb at 19 dpa (Fig. 8A), when the blastema is fully formed. Other transcription factor-encoding genes known to be involved in limb development and regeneration (msx1, msx2, prrx1, prrx2, tbx5, and hand2) were also drastically up-regulated at 19 dpa (Fig. 8A), indicating that the transcriptome defined here successfully recaptured the expression pattern of limb regeneration. Consistent with the results reported for axolotl,52 genes encoding RNA-binding proteins (rbmx, hnrnpa1, and sfrs1), matrix metalloproteinases (mmp3 and mmp11), and a novel proteinase inhibitor (kazald1) were up-regulated in regenerating limb in P. waltl at 19 dpa (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggested that these genes are commonly involved in regeneration in the two urodele amphibians. Expression profile of regenerating limb-enriched genes. (A) Expression (during regeneration) of transcription factor-encoding genes involved in limb development. The hoxa13, hoxc13, hoxd13, msx1 and 2, prrx1 and 2, tbx5, and hand2 genes were significantly up-regulated in the forelimb at 19 dpa.

A total of 274 genes in this WGCNA module (indicated by lightcyan symbol in Fig. 5) were identified.

Notably, genes encoding proteins of the large and small ribosomal subunits accounted for 25% (69 out of 274) of the genes in this module.Intriguingly, WGCNA revealed a unique transcriptomic feature of regeneration (Fig. 5C). The lightcyan module contained 274 genes that are co-regulated in regenerating limb at 19 dpa (Fig. 8B). Notably, this module included 69 ribosomal protein-encoding genes (Fig. 8B). These transcripts were not detected in other tissues and organs transcriptome data, suggesting that these ribosomal protein-encoding genes are likely to have limb- or regeneration-specific roles. These ribosomal proteins may contribute to organ remodelling via regeneration-specific protein synthesis. Consistent with this inference, the expression of ribosomal proteins is down-regulated in Xenopus spinal cord regeneration at the non-regenerative stage after metamorphosis.79The axolotl salamander is another model organism used for the study of regeneration, and the 32-Gb axolotl genome was recently reported.26 Despite being closely related in evolutionary terms, axolotl and P. waltl exhibit distinct regenerative properties. First, axolotl is a neotenic animal, that is, one that retains aspects of the larval state even after sexual maturation, unlike P. waltl. Second, axolotl shows restricted regenerative capacity compared with newts.24 What is the mechanism underlying the differences in metamorphosis and regenerative capacity between the two urodeles? Tanaka argued that the origin of regenerating limb muscle progenitors accompanying metamorphosis is switched when comparing axolotl and N. viridescens.80 Comparative study of the two model urodeles should enhance our understanding of the mechanisms used during regeneration in these animals. Our P. waltl reference transcriptome, together with the recently reported P. waltl draft genome sequence,24 is expected to facilitate genome-wide comparisons between these two model urodele amphibians.3.8. ConclusionsIn the present study, we built a reference gene catalogue of P. waltl using transcriptome data sets generated from a wide variety of samples. The reference gene set is expected to cover a large fraction of P. waltl protein-coding genes, as confirmed by BUSCO analysis, where 98% of universal single-copy orthologs were identified. The gene catalogue and the associated information will be valuable resources for any researchers studying P. waltl. To share these resources within the community, we have established a portal website, designated iNewt (http://www.nibb.ac.jp/imori/main/), from which these transcriptome data (including gene models, annotations, and expression profiles) can be obtained. The portal site also permits BLAST searches against these data sets. With these resources, P. waltl promises to serve as a good model to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration. Given the newts’ unique biological properties, we further expect that our reference gene catalogue, together with the technique of highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing,42 will open new avenues for the use of P. waltl in research besides the topic of regeneration, including developmental biology, stem cell biology, cancer research, reproductive biology, evolutionary biology, ethology, and toxico-genomics.Computations were performed in part on the NIG supercomputer at ROIS.

FisherMP can be applied for integrative analysis of binding motifs and for predicting cis-regulatory modules from a large number of ChIP-seq datasets.1. IntroductionIn the past two decades, the motif-finding problem has been an important issue in sequence feature recognition. A motif represents a set of binding sites recognized by a transcription factor (TF). Based on co-regulation of genes and phylogenetic footprinting of TFs, TF motifs can be discovered from a set of upstream non-coding DNA sequences of co-regulated or orthologous genes. Many motif-finding algorithms have been developed in the past two decades including MEME,1 BioProspector,2 Weeder,3 MotifClick4 and so on. These traditional motif finders search for over-represented segments with higher significance than non-binding segments. In the last decade, some new experimental techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP)-chip and ChIP-seq have been developed to locate TF-binding sites.5,6 By using these technologies, many motif datasets have been generated for a variety of model organisms. For example, there are Lee/Harbison ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae,7,8,Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster in the modENCODE project9,10 as well as human ChIP-seq datasets in the ENCODE project.11 One ChIP-seq experiment for a TF may produce millions of binding peak sequences by running peak-calling tools, such as MACS2.12,13 In the ENCODE database, over 60% of binding peak datasets have more than 10,000 sequences, the largest of which can have a million sequences. However, many of them include false positives due to binding peaks introduced through the mediation of protein complexes, reducing the precision of motif-finding tools. A further challenge is to find specific combinations of binding sites of potential co-regulatory TFs, which are widely observed for cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements in mammalian genomes.14,15 However, most popular tools such as MEME,1 GLAM2,16 W-ChIPMotifs17 and XXmotif18,19 can only model a single motif at a time and do not detect alternative binding motifs of co-factors.20 Therefore, it is critical to develop a fast and efficient method for processing the increasing ChIP-seq data to discover binding motifs as well as their combinations of potential co-factors.To find motifs from ChIP-seq datasets, many motif-finding tools, including DREME,21 HOMER,22 Amadeus,23 Trawler,24 motifRG,25 XXmotif,18,19 DECOD26 and FastMotif,27 have been specially designed. The vast majority of these new motif finders used a ‘discriminative’ strategy, meaning that the motif patterns should discriminate between a foreground sequence dataset and a background sequence dataset. However, they usually took a lot of computing time to find binding motifs of targeted TFs, especially for those that have millions of binding peaks called from very deeply sequenced data. In order to speed up the motif-finding procedure, these algorithms adopted some approximation schemes that include restrictions on search space (e.g. HOMER, XXmotif), the P-value estimation by approximation formula (e.g. DREME), replacing position weight matrices (PWMs) by IUPAC characters28 (e.g. DREME and motifRG), or replacing word-based methods by probabilistic sampling (e.g. FastMotif). Although several tools such as DREME, HOMER, MotifRG and FastMotif have been evaluated to be faster than other tools according to recent comparative analysis,21,27,29 they still consume a lot of time on large-scale datasets. Furthermore, these programmes are extremely slow for detecting the combinatorial motifs from large-scale ChIP-seq datasets that often occur in genomes.30 Parallel computing is a promising strategy for large data computation. HOMER and MotifRG have the option to set the number of processes, but they are still not fully parallel algorithms. Actually, HOMER is designed for a fixed motif length. The multithreading technique used in HOMER is called ‘Pthread’, which is a thread API built in Linux. When calculating k multiple motif lengths, k threads are called to run the same whole HOMER programme simultaneously. When the number of considered motif lengths is less than the number of available threads, HOMER cannot use the full computational resource. MotifRG is an R package that directly employs the parallel package of Bioconductor to call multiple cores. Although the iterations of enumerating and evaluating candidate motifs were performed in parallel, the other steps such as refining the top motifs were not parallelized. Furthermore, after getting the refined motifs, MotifRG masks all of their occurrences and repeats the same process to find next motifs sequentially, which can be further optimized by well-designed parallel strategies. Therefore, these computational tools only partially performed parallelization techniques at one or limited steps. As far as we know, only MEME and Gibbs Sampler-based algorithms have been parallelized with CUDA,31–33 and there is no specialized parallel algorithm for discriminative motif discovery in ChIP-seq data. Since these word-based algorithms should determine whether each k-mer in a sequence set is highly conservative (or discriminative), we can parallelize this step for all of the k-mers with different lengths.Based on these observations, a fully parallel algorithm called FisherMP is presented to predict the short and core-binding sites of a TF from its large-scale-binding peaks identified via ChIP-seq. FisherMP is ultra-fast and can discover genome-wide motifs from a large number of ChIP-seq datasets. In particular, the FisherMP algorithm can find the motifs of a TF’s co-factors from its binding peaks. Our analysis on CTCF ChIP-seq datasets of human chromosome X revealed the high correlation of CTCF and YY1 motifs. The combinatorial motifs of CTCF and YY1 were further confirmed on multiple human cell lines and integrative analysis of histone modification signals, indicating that they are functional co-players.2. Materials and methods2.1. Motivation and methodology overviewFisherMP is a ‘discriminative’ motif-finding programme which requires two input data files; one is the (foreground) data file containing motifs to be sought, and the other is an explicitly collected background data file. FisherMP uses Fisher’s exact test to calculate P-values of motifs. In FisherMP, the regular expression based on IUPAC symbols used in DREME21 is discarded, and the motifs are constructed directly based on word conservation. Furthermore, in order to obtain the corrected P-value of each motif, FisherMP utilizes a hash of arrays to store the indices of all possible sequences for each existing word instead of estimating the number of sequences containing each word of a motif as in DREME. Unlike DREME and MotifRG, which directly merge IUPAC motifs, FisherMP merges two motifs into a bigger one if they reach a specified high similarity score. The motif similarity metric used in FisherMP is SPIC,34 which is constructed by using information contents, PWMs and position frequency matrices (PFMs) of motifs. The parallel implementation of FisherMP is completely based on OpenMP, which is a standard API for portable shared memory parallel programming in C/C++ and is supported by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).2.2. The FisherMP algorithm with parallel computing designThe (foreground) input file should be a set of ChIP-seq-binding peak regions from a TF ChIP-seq experiment which can be identified by a peak-calling algorithm. The (background) negative sequence set should either be a similar dataset from a different ChIP-seq experiment or a set of randomly generated sequences based on the distribution of bases in the foreground file. In order to parallelize the programme, FisherMP employs six ‘fork-join’ structures. The flowchart of FisherMP with parallel design is shown in Fig. 1. Flowchart of FisherMP with parallel computing design.Flowchart of FisherMP with parallel computing design.Step 1:Reading the input files. If there is a background file, two threads are called to synchronously read the foreground and background files into two matrices (i.e. vectors of vectors) F and B of nucleotide bases, respectively. In F and B, each sequence in the input files corresponds to a row vector of base pairs. In addition, for the later construction of PWMs, the frequency of each nucleotide is counted at the same time. If there is not a background file, the matrix B is generated randomly based on the frequencies of nucleotides with the same size of F.Step 2:The first ‘fork-join’ structure. F and B are scanned with different window widths k in parallel to count all of their k-mers and construct two hash maps. Multiple threads are called for different window widths k and the two different matrices. Ideally, the optimal number of threads is 2(kmax–kmin+1) if k=kmin, kmin+1, …, kmax. The hash map of F (or B) stores all the k-mers and the index set of the foreground (or background) sequences in which they are located. More specifically, a k-mer associated with its reverse complement is stored as a key of the hash map, and the corresponding value of the key is the index array of sequences containing the k-mer or its reverse complement.Step 3:The second ‘fork-join’ structure. P-values of all k-mers based on Fisher’s exact test are calculated in parallel. From the above two hash maps, for each k-mer and its reverse complement, the numbers of sequences containing either of them in F and B can be directly calculated and used to model the Fisher’s exact test by constructing a contingency table (Supplementary Section S1 and Supplementary Table S1). In the Fisher’s exact test, the p-value of a k-mer is given by a hypergeometric distribution, which can be approximated by the Stirling formula35 (Supplementary Section S1). The P-values of different k-mers can be calculated in different threads because there is no data interchange among the threads. If t threads are called, all the k-mers in F can be divided into t groups evenly. As a result, all the k-mers in F and their corresponding P-values are stored in a hash map (for a k-mer and its reverse complement, only one is stored in the hash map).Step 4:Motif seeding and generating in the third ‘fork-join’ structure. An array A of k-mers is formed by sorting all k-mers in F by P-values in numerically ascending order and then deleting the k-mers with P-values > 0.05. The top m (the default is 100) k-mers in the array A are selected as motif seeds. For a motif seed s, a primitive motif M is constructed as follows: The motif M is initially set as{s}<U+2060>, and the P-value of M is set as the P-value of s.Starting from the last k-mer added to M in the array A, select the top k-mer t (or its reverse complement) in the following queue of A as a candidate element for M if (a) only one position of t (or its reverse complement) is different than one of the k-mers in M and (b) at most a percent (the default is 30%) positions are not conserved among t (or its reverse complement) and all the k-mers in M. If there is no such a candidate element, return M and stop.Calculate the P-value of M<U+222A>{t}<U+2060>. If the P-value of M<U+222A>{t} is less than ß (the default value is 0.05), t is added into M and go to (b), else return M and stop.Notice that for each k-mer the foreground and background indices of sequences containing it or its reverse complement have been stored in two hash maps respectively built in Step 2. Therefore, for a motif M composed of u k-mers, the union of foreground (or background) sequence index sets of the u k-mers forms the motif’s foreground (or background) sequence index array, whose size is used to calculate the P-value of M. In the end, for each primitive motif M, the PFM, PWM and the position information contents (PICs), which will be used to calculate motif similarity in the next step, are generated based on the counts of k-mers in M and the frequency of each nucleotide in F (Supplementary Section S2). Clearly, the primitive motif construction process can be conducted in parallel for each seed. If t threads are called, these seeds can be split into t groups evenly.Step 5:Computing motif similarities in the fourth ‘fork-join’ structure. The SPIC metric, which was shown to have the best performance among several metrics,34 is used to calculate the similarity between each pair of primitive motifs. For each pair of primitive motifs with the same motif length, the SPIC metric without alignment is used to calculate their similarity score which is called their “A-score” (Supplementary Section S2).For each pair of equal-length primitive motifs Mi and Mj where i < j, the PFM, PWM and PICs of Mj are first transferred into their reverse complementary forms, then two A-scores between Mi and Mj and between Mi and the reverse complement of Mj are separately calculated, and the larger one is selected as their final similarity score. Notice that all pairs of motifs can be evenly distributed to all threads because the similarity calculation between a pair of motifs does not require the information of any other motifs.Step 6:Motif merging. If a set of equal-length primitive motifs have high A-scores among one another, then they are merged into a new motif and the P-value of the new motif is also calculated.Step 7:Computing merged motif similarities in the fifth ‘fork-join’ structure. For each pair of merged motifs, the SPIC metric with ungapped alignments is used to calculate their similarity score which is called their ‘B-score’ (Supplementary Section S2). The calculation procedure of B-score is exactly the same as that of A-score in Step 5.Step 8:Motif deleting and sorting. If two motifs share the highest similarity B-score, the motif with the higher P-value is removed from the motif set. The refinement is repeated until no pair of motifs has a higher B-score than the given threshold.Step 9:Computing combinatorial motifs in the sixth ‘fork-join’ structure. With the single motif and its P-value available, we further calculate the P-value for the combinations of 2, 3, …, n motifs (the default is 2) by using a Fisher combined probability test36,37 (Supplementary Section S3). Finally, the single and combined motifs are sorted by P-values in ascending order.Note that the two steps of scanning all the k-mers in the foreground and background sequences and calculating their P-values are the most time consuming in all ‘word-based’ algorithms. In FisherMP, two ‘fork-join’ structures are designed to perfectly parallelize the two steps.2.3. Threshold settings in FisherMPIn order to find real motifs accurately, the parameters in the FisherMP algorithm should be set scientifically. At the stage of generating the primitive motifs in Step 4, it is necessary to set the ratio a of non-conserved positions in each primitive motif. For this purpose, the PICs of the 1,404 CORE PFM profiles in the JASPAR2018 database were calculated (http://jaspar.genereg.net/downloads/). If the information content of a position in a motif is <1 (note that any PIC’s value is between 0 and 2), then the position is considered relatively non-conserved. The percentage of relatively non-conserved positions was counted for each CORE PFM in JASPAR. We set the parameter a as 30% in FisherMP since 74% of the 1,404 motif profiles each contain at most 30% relatively non-conserved positions (Supplementary, Section S4 and Supplementary Fig. S1A).Furthermore, the threshold settings of the A-score and B-score used in FisherMP are based on the distribution of similarity between two sub-motifs randomly split from each known motif in JASPAR. For each motif in the JASPAR2018 CORE database, it was split into two sub-motifs randomly and the A- and B-score were calculated between the two sub-motifs. This process was repeated 10 times. For each pair of different motifs in JASPAR, the B-score was calculated, and A-score as well if the two motifs had the same length. The distributions of A-scores and B-scores between two different motifs and pairs of sub-motifs (of the same motif) are separately plotted. For the majority of the real motifs, the similarity A-scores and B-scores between two sub-motifs of the same motif were around 0.8, while the similarity scores between different motifs were generally around 0 (Supplementary Section S4and Supplementary Fig. S1B). In the step of motif merging, the threshold of A-score was set to a relatively high value 0.7 in order to reduce the chance of merging primitive motifs which do not belong to the same real motif. After the motif merging step, we found that there were very few pairs of motifs with B-scores > 0.7. Thus, in the following step of redundant motif deleting, the B-score threshold was set to a relatively high value of 0.6 in order to reduce the probability of deleting a non-redundant motif.2.4. Datasets usedThe datasets of TF ChIP-seq uniform peaks used in the paper were generated by the ENCODE project. There are 690 binding peak files available in the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi? db=hg19&g=wgEncodeAwgTfbsUniform). To assess FisherMP on real data, a total of 350 ENCODE ChIP-seq-binding peak datasets belonging to 51 TFs which have known (literature) motif profiles were selected from the Kheradpour and Kellis’s collection (http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/).38 The summarization of the ENCODE datasets, known motifs and discovered motifs used in the paper are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The binding peak file of ER in MCF-7 cells was downloaded from GSE19013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi? acc=GSE19013).392.5. Recovering motif pairsThe known TF combinations were downloaded from TcoF database40 (latest version, March 2018). In our 51 selected TF ChIP-seq datasets, 21 TFs have known combinatorial motifs including 30 combinatorial motif pairs. FisherMP was run on these 21 TF ChIP-seq datasets to detect not only the TF motifs themselves but also their combinatorial motifs. To reduce bias, the ChIP-seq datasets for each pair of cooperative TFs were selected from the same cell line as much as possible.2.6. Performance assessmentIn order to verify whether a predicted motif is identical to a known motif, the SPIC metric with ungapped alignments (i.e. the B-score) is employed to calculate their similarity.34 The SPIC metric is extremely robust because it considers sequence position in additional to identity. The SPIC metric has been optimized to have the best performance for separating true motifs from putative motifs after comparing it to seven other motif similarity metrics including Pearson correlation coefficient, average log-likelihood ratio, sum of squared distances, asymptotic covariance, P-value of Chi-square, average Kullback-Leibler and k-mer frequency vector.34,41Note that besides the known literature motif profiles; there are often multiple discovered motifs for each of the 51 TFs in the Kheradpour and Kellis’s collection (Supplementary Section S5 and Supplementary Table S2). For convenience, we call these discovered motifs ‘KK motifs’. These KK motifs were collected from the top 10 most enriched motifs (excluding duplicates) discovered by multiple motif-finding tools for each TF group.38 A large part of these KK motifs are likely to be the true motifs of these TFs and their co-factors. Each tool was evaluated by counting the number of recovered KK motifs in its top 10 predicted motifs in each dataset.We also calculated the ROC curve by using the methods provided in a previous study.42 In detail, 10 motifs of lengths from 5 to 10 were picked out from JASPAR, and then each of the 10 motifs was separately implanted into each of 10 datasets to produce 100 synthetic-binding peak files. The ith dataset consists of 1,000·i sequences of length 1,000 (i = 1, 2,…, 10). We ran the seven motif discovery algorithms to output top 20 motifs on each of the 100 synthetic peak files. With the rank of output motifs increasing, we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the areas under these curves (AUCs) for seven algorithms.In order to test the computational speeds of the algorithm for input datasets with different sizes, we conducted experiments with both synthetic data and real data. The length of each sequence in any synthetic dataset was set to 1,000 base-pairs (bp). The dataset sizes were arranged from 0.1 to 1 Mb in steps of 0.1 Mb, and from 1 to 10 Mb in steps of 1 Mb. For each setting of dataset size, 10 synthetic datasets were generated randomly based on a three-order Markov model on ENCODE-binding peak datasets, and each element of a motif were randomly picked out and inserted into each synthetic sequence. For each dataset size, 10 datasets of real data were also extracted separately from the top sequences of 10 different files which were picked up from the 690 ENCODE-binding peak files. As a result, for each motif-finding programme, the average running time was reported for each synthetic (or real) dataset size.2.7. Programme selection and parameter settingsBased on the previous literature on the comparison of motif-finding algorithms, the six new tools, DREME, HOMER, MotifRG, XXmotif, FastMotif and DECOD perform better than others on discovering true motifs.18,19,21,26,27,29 Therefore, these top tools were selected to compare the accuracy with that of FisherMP. In order to compare the computational speeds of different algorithms, four relatively fast tools, HOMER, DREME, MotifRG and FastMotif, were selected from these new tools. Note that XXmotif and DECOD were discarded for comparing computational speeds because their running times are significantly longer than the others. WSMD was also not used for comparison because it requires a commercial payment component, claims to be slower than HOMER, and is based on weak supervised learning and thus has compromised accuracy.To maximize experimental integrity, the parameter settings of these tools were kept as consistent as possible. The maximum number of motifs to find was set to 10 (e.g. FisherMP, DREME, MotifRG and DECOD). If there was no such option to set motif number in a motif-finding tool (e.g. HOMER, XXmotif and FastMotif), then the top 10 output motifs were used for performance comparison. If the motif length range could be set in a tool, then the lengths of output motifs were set from 5 to 10 (e.g. FisherMP, DREME, HOMER and MotifRG). Otherwise, the motif length was fixed to be 10 (e.g. DECOD). All the background negative sequences used in these tools were generated by themselves except DECOD, whose background sequences were generated by shuffling the corresponding foreground sequences. Note that multiple processer cores can be called by FisherMP, HOMER and MotifRG. The number of threads was set to four in HOMER and MotifRG due to the popularity of quad-core processors. Four and six threads were tested separately for FisherMP. Besides the above settings, the motif search was double-stranded if possible, the P-value cut-off was 0.05, and all other settings were set by default. The specific commands of the seven tools used in the paper are described in the last section of the Supplementary Material. All of the experiments were done on a 64-bit Linux server with two 8-core CPUs (Intel Xeon E5 2.1 GHz).3. Results3.1. High performance of FisherMP for finding motifs on human ChIP datasetsTo evaluate the performance of FisherMP for finding TF motifs, we ran it on all 350 ChIP-seq experiments of 51 TFs that were downloaded from the ENCODE project. The validations on genome-wide ChIP experiments for TFs of multiple cell lines provided unbiased performances in real applications. Since the predicted motifs are defined by their consensus sequences, we considered the real motif of a TF as recalled if its similarity to its predicted motifs was larger than a certain similarity threshold. We used two criteria: the PA and ARR. For these 51 TFs, the PA was defined as proportion of recalled motifs among all 350 datasets. We found FisherMP achieved as high as 80% for the similarity threshold of 0.6 (Fig. 2A). When ranging similarity threshold from 0.6 to 0.9, the PAs of FisherMP were decreasing, suggesting that the predicted consensus motifs are different than the real motifs in some of datasets. Performance comparison of FisherMP with six other motif-finding methods. (A) The distributions of PA for seven motif-finding programmes under different similarity thresholds.

(A) The distributions of PA for seven motif-finding programmes under different similarity thresholds. (B) The distributions of ARR under different similarity thresholds. (C) The ROC curves of seven programmes. FPR and TPR. (D) The AUC scores of seven programmes.In the Kheradpour and Kellis’s collection,38 many motifs are likely to be the true motifs of these TFs and their co-factors, named KK motifs. We collected the KK motifs of our studied 51 TFs and defined a KK motif as ‘recovered’ if the top 10 predicted motifs contained a motif such that the similarity between the KK motif and the predicted motif was greater than a similarity threshold. Then the ARR was defined as averaged proportions of each TF’s recovered KK motifs among all 350 datasets. Consistent with the previous PR results, we found FisherMP achieved an ARR as high as 62% for the similarity threshold of 0.6 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these cross TFs and cross cells validations indicate FisherMP can achieve accurate performance not only for single motifs, but also for multiple alternative motifs of a TF.3.2. Comparing FisherMP with other methodsWe compared FisherMP with six other motif-finding tools on these 350 ChIP-seq datasets. All methods were separately executed, and the PA and ARR values for each programme were calculated for different motif similarity thresholds. As shown in Fig. 2A, FisherMP achieved the best PR score of 80% for a similarity threshold of 0.6. Although PR scores were decreasing when similarity thresholds increased, FisherMP kept the optimum PR scores among these methods. For the ARR scores, we found FisherMP and XXmotif were better than other methods. Specifically, FisherMP can achieve an ARR score of 63% when similarity thresholds ranged from 0.6 (Fig. 2B).Considering that the criteria PA and ARR mainly focus on the sensitivity rather than specificity, we further calculated the ROC curves by using the methods provided in a previous study.42 The ability of FisherMP and other algorithms to recall real testing motifs was validated on 100 synthetic-binding peak files. We then plotted ROC curves and calculated the AUC for these seven algorithms (Fig. 2C and D). We found FisherMP can achieve a high true positive rate (TPR) of 80% while keeping a low false positive rate (FPR) of ~7%. When the TPR of FisherMP is bigger than 90%, the FPR is still <12%. The AUC of FisherMP is 93.45%, which is the best among seven tested algorithms.3.3. Super computational speed of FisherMPThe main goal of the FisherMP algorithm is to improve the computational speed of motif prediction. To test and prove its computational superiority, four relatively fast programmes were used for comparison. Four threads (or processes) were called in MotifRG and HOMER. For each dataset size (the length of each sequence is 1,000 bp), the average running time of a programme on 10 synthetic datasets of the size was obtained. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, FisherMP was the fastest among the five programmes if it also called four threads. In particular, for a big file of 10 Mb, FisherMP took only 300–400 s, while each of the other algorithms took thousands of seconds. For real ENCODE ChIP-binding peak data, as shown in Fig. 3C and D, FisherMP was also the fastest, and the running times had no significant change between real data and synthetic data. Note that the other algorithms were more time-consuming in the real data than in the synthetic data because each synthetic dataset was only embedded in one motif while the number of real motifs in a real dataset is unknown. Comparative analysis of running time. Comparisons of running times on synthetic datasets (A) and (B) and human ENCODE datasets (C) and (D) with different sizes. (E) Running times of FisherMP on different number of threads.Comparative analysis of running time. Comparisons of running times on synthetic datasets (A) and (B) and human ENCODE datasets (C) and (D) with different sizes. (E) Running times of FisherMP on different number of threads.Because the design of FisherMP is fully parallelized, the algorithm will be faster if more threads are called. As with our previous experiments, the lengths of motifs searched by FisherMP were set with 6 different lengths (from 5 to 10), and the number of output motifs was set to 10. By changing the number of threads, the running time curve of FisherMP can be obtained. In order to see how efficient FisherMP was with the number of threads increasing, only the real ENCODE datasets with two big sizes (5 and 10 Mb size) were used to plot two running time curves, respectively (Fig. 3E). When the number of threads was set higher than 6, the running time of FisherMP was not severely affected. This is because FisherMP was executed with six different motif lengths in the experiments, and one motif length corresponding to one thread is the best parallel scheme.3.4. Detecting combinatorial motifsIn mammalian genomes, gene expressions are widely controlled by combinatorial TFs but rarely by a single TF. From a ChIP-seq dataset of a TF, current motif-finding tools can usually find the binding peaks for a TF but can’t output the potential combinatorial TF motifs of its co-player TFs. One may overlap two sets of TF ChIP-seq data to get the co-occurrence of two TFs. However, there are more than 2,000 TFs encoded in the human genome and most of them have no antibodies, and thus no ChIP-seq data available. Considering that combinatorial cis-regulatory TFs in mammalian genomes typically exhibit their binding sites within the same genomic proximity, we hypothesized that it should be possible to discover the co-players and their potential combinatorial motifs for a targeted TF from its ChIP-seq by identifying over-represented combinations of sequence motifs that occur together in the ChIP-seq peaks. To this aim, we further extended our method to detect the combinatorial motifs by using a Fisher combined probability test of the P-values of single motifs.We tested our strategy for the known TF combinations that were downloaded from TcoF database40 (latest version, March 2018). In our 51 selected TF ChIP-seq datasets, 21 TFs have known combinatorial motifs including 30 combinatorial motif pairs among them that belong to 4 cell lines, K562, GM12878, HepG2 and Hela-S3, where GM12878 has the most abundant resource of TF ChIP-seq in the ENCODE project database. For each of the 21 TFs, FisherMP was run on the peaks of its ChIP-seq datasets to detect whether the motifs of the TF and its cooperative TFs can be found in pairs with high confidence. We found that, among 24 of 30 datasets (24/30 = 80%), the true motif was top one ranked (Table 1). Of the remaining six datasets, two had the true motif ranked in the second position, three had the true motif ranked in the third position, and one had the true motif ranked in the sixth position. In total, the average rank of these TF motifs was 1.43 (s.d. = 1.07). We then checked the motifs for their cooperative TFs and found 25 of them successfully detected co-players (25/30 <U+224D> 83.33%). These 25 paired TFs were ranked very high (5.08 ± 5.33) and their combined P-values are very significant (P-values = 1.35e-59). Considering that the binding sites and co-binding partners of each TF can be tissue-specific, we further checked the results of the same TF on two cell lines and found that the significance (P-value) of cooperative TFs are different between cells. For example, we can detect the cooperative pair of CEBPB and MYC from CEBPB ChIP-seq of K562 cell line but not from the CEBPB ChIP-seq data of GM12878 and HepG2 cell line respectively. Furthermore, we also observed the asymmetric ranking for a cooperative TF pair for a same cell line. For example, when checked the SRF ChIP-seq of K562, we can find the motifs of its cooperative TF, SP1, to be ranked in 10 (P-value 2.30e-82). However, SRF motifs can’t be detected by using SP1 ChIP-seq of K562. These results demonstrated that the TFs preferentially collaborate with different TFs for implementing cellular functions in different cells.Predicting 30 combinational motif pairs‘—’ means out of detection.Predicting 30 combinational motif pairs‘—’ means out of detection.We performed FisherMP on ER alpha ChIP-seq data of MCF-7 cell line and outputted top 10 ranked TFs with high significance (P-value < 1.0e-100, Supplementary Table S3). To characterize if these TFs are potential cooperative factors with ER alpha in MCF7-7 cell, we searched the publications in the PubMed database and found eight of them have been reported to be correlated with ER alpha in MCF-7 for regulating gene expressions. Additionally, many research papers had reported that the SP1, ZNF384, TP53 and TFAP2C are important cooperative players with ER alpha in breast cancer development.43–46 For example, SP1 is essential for the full transcriptional activity of ER alpha and their interactions will control the transcription of IGF-IQ gene whose dysregulated expression have pathologic consequences with relevance in breast cancer aetiology.43,47 Recent research revealed that ZNF384 can stimulate MCF-7 breast cancer growth by regulating cell cycle and metastasis-related genes via an ER alpha dependent pathway.46 These results demonstrated that our programme can well predict the cooperative factors even for tissue-specific TF.3.5. CTCF and YY1 are co-players in human X chromosomeTo further demonstrate the ability of FisherMP for finding true TF combinations, we performed integrative analysis of CTCF and YY1 for chromosome X in the GM12878 cell line. CTCF is a ubiquitously expressed protein with 11 zinc finger DNA-binding domains, and it is involved in the transcriptional regulation of many genes.48 Acting as a transcriptional activator, repressor, and insulator, it binds to tens of thousands of genomic sites and can interact with a plethora of other TFs.49 The divergent functions of CTCF and abundance of its cooperative TFs make it difficult to detect a specific cooperative TF. Among these cooperative TFs, YY1 was reported as a cofactor of CTCF for the chromosome X binary switch.50 Here we tested whether the motifs of CTCF and its co-factor YY1 can be found by these motif-finding tools in chromosome X. To this end, the binding peaks of CTCF in chromosome X (total 140,569 peak sequences) were isolated from the CTCF’s 99 ChIP-seq datasets and merged into a new file which contained 4471 unique binding peaks. After running FisherMP, XXmotif, MotifRG, DECOD, DREME, HOMER, and FastMotif on the new file, we found that FisherMP had the best performance. The top two output results of FisherMP correspond to the motifs of CTCF and YY1 (Table 2). Meanwhile, among the motifs output by the six motif-finding tools, FisherMP had the best fit with the two known motifs of CTCF and YY1, respectively. XXmotif and FastMotif could not output any motif similar to YY1’s directly. Even though the results of MotifRG, DREME, HOMER, and DECOD contain some motifs similar to YY1’s, their predicted YY1 motifs had lower ranking and lower similarity than FisherMP predictions. In addition, among the 4,471 peak sequences FisherMP found that 2584 sequences contain CTCF’s-binding sites and 2353 sequences contain the binding sites of both CTCF and YY1. This overlap was found to be very significant (P-value 8.02e-334, hypergeometric testing, one-sided), indicating that YY1 and CTCF work together on the X chromosome. We also performed the detections of the seven motif-finding tools on CTCF ChIP-seq of GM12878 cell line by using all chromosomes as a control. As shown in the Table 2, these tools, excepting FisherMP and DREME, are failed to find the YY1’s motifs in a genome wide way. Although MotifRG, HOMER, and DECOD can output suspected motifs of YY1 for the ChrX, they failed to detect the YY1 motifs by using all chromosomes.Comparisons of CTCF and YY1’s motifs output on ChrX and all chromosomes by seven motif-finding tools, respectively‘—’ means out of detection.Comparisons of CTCF and YY1’s motifs output on ChrX and all chromosomes by seven motif-finding tools, respectively‘—’ means out of detection.We then performed a systematic analysis of all combinatorial motifs outputted in top 10 ranked results to check if they belonged to potential combinatorial TFs. Indeed, these motifs were found to be very significant and their consensus sequences were highly similar to the sequences provided in the JASPAR database (Supplementary Table S4). Among these top ten motifs, we aligned the binding peaks of YY1, MAZ, STAT3, and USF2 that had ChIP-seq data available in the ENCODE database. We found that the paired binding peaks were highly correlated to each other (Pearson correlation 0.71 ± 0.16). To understand the high correlations of these TFs and their potential functions, we illustrate an integrative analysis of a 2.4 Mb region (ChrX: 46400000-48800000) that displays TF motifs, binding peaks, and histone modifications. It is clearly shown that the TFs-binding peaks are not only highly coordinated with each other, but that they are also correlated to the histone modifications H3K27ac, H3K79me2, H3K4me2, H3K9ac, H3K4me3, and H2A.Z (Fig. 4A). Since these histone marks are usually located at active chromosomal regions, these motifs may collaborate with CTCF for gene regulation. In fact, the peaks of histone modifications and TF-binding peaks are mainly observed at gene promoter regions (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the TF-binding peaks are located within a ~200 bp gap of histone modifications, suggesting that the histone proteins had been removed in order to facilitate TF binding (Fig. 4C). By searching the chromosomal sequence of this TF-binding region (400 bp, ChrX: 47052880-47053260), we successfully detected the motifs for these TFs (Fig. 4C, right side). For each TF, we further scanned 4471 CTCF peaks located on chromosome X to detect peaks that included its motifs. In total, we found 2,584, 4,033, 2,189, 2,254 and 2,526 peaks including CTCF, YY1, MAZ, STAT3 and USF2 motifs respectively. We observed they are highly overlapped (Fig. 4D) and their paired overlapping are significant (P-value < 0.05, hypergeometric testing, one-sided. Supplementary Table S5). We further tested that if the CTCF motifs can be detected from the YY1, MAZ, STAT3 and USF2 ChIP-seq data. As shown in Table 3, we found that CTCF motifs were ranked in top 10 in YY1, MAZ and STAT3 ChIP-seq data. However they are not top ranked in USF2 ChIP-seq data (rank of 21). These results were confirmed on all chromosomes, suggesting CTCF could be a major partner of YY1, MAZ and STAT3 in the whole genome. Meanwhile, CTCF might be a major partner of USF2 in the X chromosome but not in the whole genome. Taken together, the mutual analysis of these 5 TFs supports their genomic proximity as well as their co-occurrence with histone modifications, strongly suggesting that they are cooperative regulators of gene expression.Integrative analysis of CTCF and combinatorial TFs on chrX.

DiscussionFinding the binding motifs of TFs and their combinations is a long standing problem in computational biology. Since it has been proved to be a NP-hard problem,51 suggesting there is no polynomial time algorithm to find the exact solution, the existing methods are all based on the balance of the precision and running speed. Many heuristic strategies have been used in these methods, but they are still quite time consuming on large scale ChIP-seq datasets. By fully using parallel computation technology, FisherMP is designed as an ultra-fast programme for discriminatively finding motifs on large-size ChIP-seq datasets while keeping relatively high precision. Actually, FisherMP is faster than most of other algorithms even when a single thread is called, since it is designed to avoid multiple nested loops and iteratively updating PWMs. FisherMP merges motifs and removes redundancies quickly (without complex iterations) by calculating motif similarity to reduce computing time. Furthermore, FisherMP identifies relatively more true motifs of the corresponding TFs from all the ChIP datasets of a species than the other tools, and has the additional capability of recovering many motifs of their co-factors in the meantime. A useful feature of the software is that it computes sequence indices containing all cis-regulatory elements of the motif and stores the information in a hash map. This enables FisherMP to output all important information including motif position, its PFM, PICs and PWM, which is convenient for researchers investigating motif profiles or performing module analyses. For example, the PFM and PWM outputted by our pipeline can be directly used to generate motif logos52 or calculate the binding energy.53 In genome-wide predicting cis-regulatory modules from a large number of ChIP-seq datasets, PWMs can be firstly used for scanning the motif positions among sequences to find homotypic or heterotypic clusters of binding sites for any combination of TFs.30Although large scale validations on ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets demonstrate that FisherMP has exceptional performance in finding motifs, there is always room to improve precision and running speed. Also, although the majority of known motif profiles have lengths no >10 bp, we noticed that some longer KK motifs exist. The default parameters of FisherMP will not identify the full length of long KK motifs since the single motif length is defaulted as 10 in the pipeline. Users are suggested to extend the search range of motif lengths if they want to detect longer motifs. Furthermore, there is little accelerating room if the number of threads is >12, because the optimal number of threads is 2(kmax–kmin+1) = 12 to construct two hash maps in the first ‘fork-join’ structure of FisherMP. The default number of threads in FisherMP is set to kmax–kmin+1 if the minimum and maximum motif lengths are set to kmin and kmax.Finding combinatorial motifs is extremely important in real biological applications since gene expressions are widely controlled by combinatorial TFs. We had applied FisherMP on 30 known TF combinations provided by TcoF database40 and 25 pairs were successfully recalled, achieving a high precision of 83.33%. A detailed analysis of CTCF and YY1 shows their motifs are highly correlated in chrX. Besides CTCF and YY1, we also analysed the top ranked motifs of STAT3, MAZ and USP2, which all were clearly supported by the binding peaks from independent ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project. Furthermore, these TF-binding peaks and their DNA motifs were also observed to be correlated with multiple histone modifications, exhibiting clusters of regulatory factors at gene promoter regions. In general, this integrative analysis of DNA motifs, binding peaks, histone modifications, and RNA-seq results can be performed for detecting not only active TFs related to gene expressions but also regulatory modules of TFs among divergent cells. In summary, these computational results and integrative analysis demonstrate that FisherMP is ultrafast and highly precise for detecting combinatorial motifs. We believe that FisherMP can help systematically investigate the mechanisms how TFs work collaboratively and coordinately in gene regulation.Data availabilityFisherMP was parallelized with OpenMP and coded in C++ for achieving not only fast speed, but also the installation convenience. FisherMP is very easy to install since OpenMP is a standard library in the GCC and no additional plug-in for parallel programming is required. The C++ source code of FisherMP is publicly available at https://github.com/shaoqiangzhang/fishermp.We would thank Dr Kelly Daescu for critical reading of the article.Conflict of interestNone declared.FundingThis work was supported by a grant 61572358 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and a grant 16JCYBJC23600 from Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin to S.Z., and US National Science Foundation (DBI-1661332) and NIH (R01GM106013) to Z.S.Supplementary data"

Flowering time and maturity are the most important traits to determine the adaptability of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivation. These not only restrict the cultivation area but also greatly affect plant architecture and yield.1,2 Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the genetic factors affecting flowering time and maturity and control them using a combination of alleles with different genetic effects on flowering time. To combine such alleles freely based on DNA marker-assisted selection, a catalogue of alleles for breeding materials will be necessary. Soybean is a typical short-day plant. Several functional nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for diversity in flowering time among cultivars are already known.3 Classical maturity loci designated as E loci have been characterized, including E1 and E2,4,E3,5,E4,6,E7,7,E8,1,E9,8 and E10.9 Of these, E1,10,E2,11,E3,12,E4,13 and E98 have been isolated as flowering time-related genes. E1 encodes putative transcriptional factor containing plant-specific B3 domain.10,E2 encodes a homologue of GIGANTEA.11,E3 and E4 encode a homologue of the photoreceptor phytochrome A (PHYA).12,E9 encodes the florigen protein FT2a.8In the E1 gene, three alleles, namely e1-as (=e1 designated by Bernard4), e1-fs, and e1-nl, have been reported as early flowering phenotype under long-day conditions.10 The e1-as allele has a single missense mutation (Arg15Thr) in the coding region. The e1-as genotype promotes flowering for ~10 days compared with that by the E1 genotype under natural day-length conditions at Matsudo, Japan (35°78'N, 139°90'E). The e1-fs allele has a 1-bp deletion, resulting in a premature stop codon in the cultivar Sakamotowase.10,e1-nl is a null allele in which ~142 kb, including the entire E1 gene, is deleted in some early flowering cultivars.10 In contrast, only one e2 allele has been reported in the E2 gene. The e2 allele has one premature stop codon mutation due to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 10th exon.11 The e2 genotype promotes flowering for ~9 days under natural day-length conditions at Tsukuba, Japan (36°03'N, 140°04'E).11 In the E3 gene, e3-Mo, e3-fs, e3-tr (=e3 designated by Buzzell5), and e3-ns have been reported as nonfunctional alleles.12,14 The e3-Mo alleles have SNP for a non-synonymous amino acid substitution (G1050R) in the third exon.3,12 The e3-fs allele has a single base insertion in the exon, resulting in frameshift mutation.14 The e3-ns allele has a nonsense mutation in which a single nucleotide substitution in exon 3 creates a stop codon.14 The e3-tr alleles lack a 13.33-kb genomic region including a part of exons 3 and 4.3,14 These nonfunctional alleles promote flowering under long-day conditions. In addition, E3-Mi and E3-Ha also have been reported as functional alleles.12,14 The E3-Mi alleles have a 2.633-kb deletion in the third intron. As for the E4 gene, five nonfunctional alleles, viz., e4-SORE-1, e4-kam, e4-kes, e4-oto, and e4-tsu, have been reported.12,14,15 The e4-SORE-1 (=e4 designated by Buzzell and Voldeng6) alleles have a Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon (SORE-1) insertion in first exon, resulting in a nonfunctional allele.These E1–E4 genes can result in variation in flowering time by controlling the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes, FT2a and FT5a.10,11,14,16 The florigen protein FT2a is encoded by E9. The e9 allele has a SORE-1 insertion in the first intron. Although eight SNPs and six InDels in the E9 have been reported, the influence on gene function is unknown.17 The FT5a gene was identified as qDTF-J, which promotes the flowering time for ~5 days under natural day-length conditions at Hokkaido, Japan (43°07'N, 141°35'E).18 In the FT5a gene, 13 SNPs and 3 InDels are reported only in the promoter and untranslated regions (UTRs) in 439 cultivated and wild soybean accessions.The functional nucleotide polymorphisms of the four E genes (E1–E4) are useful to predict the flowering time and could explain ~62–66% of the phenotypic variation in flowering time among 63 Japanese accessions under long-day conditions.3 However, prediction of flowering time will be difficult if the breeding materials have unknown alleles affecting flowering phenotype. Therefore, development of a sequencing system that can easily capture as many alleles as possible is required. Recently, it became possible to obtain whole-genome information easily with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. However, it is still expensive for re-sequencing large genomes. Moreover, it is necessary to have analytical and storage environments to deal with enormous amounts of whole-genome sequence data of genetic resources. Target re-sequence is one of the alternative sequencing methods to obtain sequence data of a limited region, which can minimize cost and time for data analysis and decrease data storage. The AmpliSeq technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) is one of the target re-sequencing technologies, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay targeting regions of interest. The AmpliSeq Designer19 designs primer set that amplifies PCR products ranging from 75 to 375 bp in the target region, and multiplex-PCR products are sequenced by NGS. The method enables amplification of ~6,000 amplicons by ultra-high multiplex PCR and constructs a targeted sequencing library in 10 h.20 In routine genotyping of crop breeding, NGS-based techniques need to meet several criteria. The processing time between sample collection and interpretation of sequencing should be short. Furthermore, it is necessary to construct libraries using limited amount of input DNA including partially degraded DNA sample and the read depth must be deep enough to detect variant accurately. The Ion Torrent platform19,20 in combination with the AmpliSeq multiplex PCR can use DNA input of as low as 10 ng, and the processing time between sample collection and sequence analysis can be finished within 5 days.20 The AmpliSeq technology is frequently used for studying human inherited cancer, but it can also be applied to plant and agronomic research.In this study, we applied AmpliSeq technology to clarify the alleles of flowering time-related genes and their homologues in diverse soybean germplasm to identify novel and known variations associated with flowering time.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA extractionDNA was extracted from 192 accessions of a soybean mini-core collection, provided by Genebank, NARO21 (Supplementary Table S1). Of these, 122 accessions were sown and germinated in plastic pots on rock wool material ‘grodan’ (Nittobo, Tokyo, Japan) moistened with water. After 10 days under 12 h light/12 h dark conditions at 25°C, the first leaf was collected in a 2-ml tube. The leaf tissue of 38 samples was ground in liquid nitrogen and CTAB buffer, and then immediately used for DNA extraction manually.22 The remaining 84 samples were dried in a freeze dryer (FDU-2100, EYELA, Tokyo, Japan). These samples were lyophilized at -80°C for 12 h and stored at 4°C. The dried leaves were crushed using a ShakeMaster (Bio Medical Science Inc. Tokyo, Japan) and the leaf powder was used to extract DNA. DNA from 44 samples was extracted using the CTAB DNA extraction kit (NR-502, KURABO, Osaka, Japan) and DNA extraction robot PE-480 (GENE PREP STAR, KURABO). DNA from another 40 samples was extracted by the bead-based method of the BioSprint 96 DNA Plant Kit on robotic workstation (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). From the other 70 samples, DNA was extracted from the seed tissue using the BioSprint 96 DNA Plant Kit on robotic workstation, according to the manufacturer’s instruction (QIAGEN). The seed tissue samples were obtained by scraping dried seed and crushing using Zirconia beads and TissueLyser II (QIAGEN). The quality of extracted DNA was evaluated based on the DNA integrity number, which is an index showing the fragmentation degree of DNA using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by exciting at 485 nm and measuring the fluorescence intensity at 520 nm. The instrument was calibrated with the Quant-iT dsDNA BR Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.2.2. Ion AmpliSeq custom panel designA custom panel targeting 29 genes was designed based on Soybean reference genome version 1.123 using the Ion AmpliSeq Designer tool19 version 1.2.9 using the standard DNA (125–275 bp amplicon target sizes) option. Two primer pools were designed to amplify 382 amplicons, covering 29 target genes of total length 64.98 kb (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These included the coding regions of B3 domain containing genes (E1 and homologue), Phytochrome A genes (E3 and E4), Phytochrome B genes, FT/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) family genes (including FT2a, FT5a, and Dt1), two-component response regulator-like genes, MADS box gene, WD repeat-containing gene (WDR61), Achaete-scute transcription factor gene, and a part of the exon of GIGANTEA (E2).Genomic regions or SNP targeted by the AmpliSeq designGene description from Phytozome 12.Gene name refers to Kong et al.,8 Wu et al.,29 Fan et al.,52 and Cao et al.53Total size of amplified region by designed amplicon primers.Target size (bp) of amplicon based on soybean genome version 1.1 (Gmax189).Total number of designed amplicons on target gene.Percentage of target region covered by amplicon.Glyma.04G143300 and Glyma.U034500on Gmax275 genome version were different chromosome positions on Gmax189.The gene annotation manually curated.‘Achaete-scute transcription factor related’ gene was included as control for variant detection.Genomic regions or SNP targeted by the AmpliSeq designGene description from Phytozome 12.Gene name refers to Kong et al.,8 Wu et al.,29 Fan et al.,52 and Cao et al.53Total size of amplified region by designed amplicon primers.Target size (bp) of amplicon based on soybean genome version 1.1 (Gmax189).Total number of designed amplicons on target gene.Percentage of target region covered by amplicon.Glyma.04G143300 and Glyma.U034500on Gmax275 genome version were different chromosome positions on Gmax189.The gene annotation manually curated.‘Achaete-scute transcription factor related’ gene was included as control for variant detection.2.3. Library preparation and sequencingThe Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to quantify DNA for NGS library construction. The NGS library was constructed using the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Japanese version corresponding to Manual 2014.7 rev.B.0 version: https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0013432_Ion_AmpliSeq_Library_Prep_on_Ion_Chef_UG.pdf, 25 March 2019, date last accessed). For the multiplex-PCR amplification, 1–10 ng of each DNA was amplified using one primer pool (191 amplicon primer pairs) per reaction. This was performed using 4 µl of 5× Ion AmpliSeq HiFi Master Mix, 10 µl of 2× AmpliSeq Custom Primer Pool, 1–10 ng of DNA, and the volume was made up to 20 µl with nuclease-free water. The reaction mix was heated for 2 min at 99°C for enzyme activation, followed by 18 two-step cycles at 99°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 4 min, and ending with a holding period at 10°C. As for low-quality DNA samples, 21 cycles were subjected under similar conditions. The primers of amplicons were digested and phosphorylated for adapter ligation using 2 µl of FuPa enzyme per sample at 55°C for 10 min, followed by enzyme inactivation at 60°C for 20 min. To enable multiple libraries to be loaded per chip, 2 µl of a unique diluted mix, including Ion Xpress Barcode and Ion P1 Adapters at standard volumes, was ligated to the end of the digested amplicons using 2 µl of DNA ligase at 22°C for 30 min, followed by ligase inactivation for 10 min at 72°C. The resulting un-amplified adapter-ligated library was purified using 45 µl of Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), followed by washing using 150 µl of freshly prepared 70% ethanol. After purification, 50 µl of Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity and 2 µl of Library Amplification Primer Mix of the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 were added to the dried AMPure XP beads, and then the reaction plate was placed on a magnetic rack to separate the beads from the supernatant. The amplicon library in the supernatant was further amplified to enrich the material for accurate quantification at 98°C for 2 min, followed by five two-step cycles at 98°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 1 min. The amplified amplicon library was then purified using 25 µl of AMPure XP, followed by a second purification step with 60 µl of AMPure XP and 150 µl of freshly prepared 70% ethanol. The concentration and size distribution of amplicons in the library were then determined using an Agilent BioAnalyzer DNA High-Sensitivity chip or TapeStation 4200 D1000 chip (Agilent Technologies), according to the instruction of the manufacturer. After quantification, each library was diluted to a concentration of 100 pM prior to template preparation. Subsequently, the libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts prior to further processing. Emulsion PCR, emulsion breaking, and enrichment for template preparation of ion sphere particles were performed using the Ion 520 & 530 and 540 Kit-Chef (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. After the preparation of ion sphere particles, sequencing was performed with an Ion Torrent Ion S5 or S5XL system using Ion 520 and 540 Chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the instruction of the manufacturer.2.4. Data analysisVariant calling was performed using the default (low stringency) and custom parameters (Supplementary Table S4). All accessions used in this study were propagated by the single seed descent method; therefore, all variants should be detected as homozygous theoretically. The parameter of TMAP in Torrent Variant Caller was changed to loosen the judgment condition of homozygous by setting ‘snp_min_allele_freq’ from 0.15 (default) to 0.3. In this condition, the SNP was detected with allele frequency of >70% as homozygous. The InDels were detected as homozygous when allele frequency was >75% (default parameter). Sequence variants detected as heterozygous under these conditions were excluded. The vcf files obtained were annotated and filtered using the snpEff version 4.0e.242.5. Detection of known and novel SNPs and InDelsThe known alleles E1, E2, E3, and E4 were investigated as described above.3 The polymorphism information from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database25 (dbSNP: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp, 25 March 2019, date last accessed, data downloaded on 29 April 2016) was used to investigate whether the detected polymorphism has already been identified in the whole-genome sequence of soybean. As the position of soybean genome in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Phytozome v12.1 are not consistent, we converted the position of SNP in the dbSNP from the NCBI to that of Gmax275 of Phytozome v12.1. The SNP ID number (rs; refSNP cluster) was used for the SNP name.2.6. Validation of SNPs and InDelsThe detected variants of the Phytochrome A (E3, E4) and FT genes (FT2a and FT5a) were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The exon containing the novel variants was amplified by PCR using the primers shown in Supplementary Table S5. The PCR product was purified using Affymetrix ExoSap-IT regent (ExoSap-IT, USB Corporation, Staufen, Germany) and directly sequenced for both sense and antisense strands using Big Dye Terminator version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The sequences were analysed using Genetics software version 10.0.8 (GENETYX Corp., Japan).2.7. Gene-based multiple regression association testing for flowering timeFlowering time was evaluated from 2011 to 2013 at the National Institute of Crop Science (36°02'N, 140°11'E), Tsukuba, Japan. Seeds were sown on 12 July 2011, and 10 July 2012 and 2013. A starter fertilizer containing 3, 10, and 10 g m-2 of N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively, was applied. Each accession was planted in single-row plots. Each row was paved 0.7 m apart and each plot comprised 12 plants that were spaced 0.13 m apart. The average days to flowering in each plot were used for analysis. Association between days to flowering and each polymorphic SNPs/InDels was assessed using linear regression, where the simulated trait values across the 190 individuals were regressed onto the numeric code of each SNP and InDel genotype; this tested the null hypothesis of the additive allelic effect on the trait. Regression analyses were performed using ‘lm()’ in R.26 First, simple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of the detected variant on flowering time at the significance level of P < 0.05. Subsequently, multiple linear regression analysis was performed using the significantly representative variants after removing redundant variants at the significance level of P < 0.05.3. Results and discussion3.1. Amplicon design and comparison of library quality using DNA samples derived from the leaf and seedTo evaluate the performance of AmpliSeq, we focused on gene region of 29 genes (Table 1) selected from known genes related to flowering time and their homologues in soybean. A total of 382 amplicon primer pairs consisting of two primer pools (Supplementary Table S3) were designed for the 64.98-kb target region using the AmpliSeq designer tool. These primer pairs covered 98.4% of the target region, ranging from 89.8% to 100%, by overlapping PCR products of total length 70,180 bp (Supplementary Table S2). The average amplicon size including primer region was 237.1 bp ranging from 125 to 275 bp (target region was 65–232 bp). The target gene with the lowest coverage (89.8%) was Glyma.16g044200 (FT-like gene).We examined the DNA quality necessary for AmpliSeq library construction because genotyping is commonly performed using low-quality DNA especially that derived from the seed of soybean for marker-assisted selection. Low-quality DNA derived from the seed was obtained at concentrations of 0.5–3 ng/µl, whereas high-quality DNA from the leaf was obtained at concentrations of 30–50 ng/µl (Fig. 1A). We used 1–10 ng of seed-derived DNA and 10 ng of leaf-derived DNA for preparing AmpliSeq library. To confirm whether low-quality DNA can produce a library of sufficient quality, distribution range of amplicons in the libraries prepared using low-quality DNA was compared with that of high-quality DNA, which is recommended for sequencing using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer or TapeStation 4200 (Fig. 1A and B). No difference was observed between low-quality DNA from the seed and high-quality DNA from the leaf in the size range of amplicons (130–370 bp) or maximum peak amplitude (Fig. 1B and C). These results reveal that the AmpliSeq library of sufficient yield and quality can be prepared from low-quality DNA. We then prepared sufficient amount of library using DNA derived from the leaf or seed of the soybean mini-core collection.

Performance of NGS and uniformity of amplicon coverageAmong 105,761,267 reads obtained, 105,603,249 (99.85%) reads were mapped to Williams 82 reference genome Gmax275 using TMAP and the average read depth across the target region was 1,237× (Supplementary Table S6). According to the on-target rate, 94.12% of the reads was mapped to the targeted regions. The average read length, average on-target rate, and uniformity (percent of reads >0.2× of mean coverage in the sample) of the leaf and seed samples were similar, but a few seed samples showed lower average read length and uniformity (Fig. 2A). The highly fragmented DNA sample showed low amplification of long amplicons (> 200 bp) and low uniformity (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Low average amplicon length or low uniformity of the samples might be caused by DNA fragmentation or contamination of the DNA solution.27Comparison of sequence performance metrics classified by the plant materials used for DNA extraction. (A) The box plot of average read length, on-target rate, and uniformity. The on-target rate is on-target percent of the aligned reads. Uniformity is the percent of bases in all the amplicon-targeted regions covered by at least 0.2× the mean base read depth. (B) Average normalized reads (APKM) per sample across 382 amplicons generated from the 192 mini-core collection. The X and Y axes indicate 382 amplicons sorted in their read coverage and APKM shown as the mean on a log scale, respectively.Comparison of sequence performance metrics classified by the plant materials used for DNA extraction.

The X and Y axes indicate 382 amplicons sorted in their read coverage and APKM shown as the mean on a log scale, respectively.To compare the efficiency of PCR amplification of each amplicon, the APKM was calculated for each amplicon. The magnitude of APKM was similar irrespective of the type of DNA sample between the leaf and seed (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, there was no relationship between the APKM and read length of amplicons (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The APKM ranged from 0 to 3,333. Only one amplicon (AMPL1040290) had zero read. As the primer pair of AMPL1040290 was designed for the region flanking the TA-repeat microsatellite, it is difficult to amplify by multiplex PCR. We could amplify amplicons of 400–450 bp using the single primer pair of AMPL1040290.We evaluated known alleles as an example to verify whether the reads were correctly mapped. Among two alleles with a large deletion, e3-Mo and e3-tr, at the E3 gene on Chr19,12 the read mapping status of the e3tr allele, with a 15-kb deletion including the fourth exon, was examined by designing four amplicons, viz., AMPL1040313, AMPL1040314, AMPL1037722, and AMPL1036854 (Fig. 3). The mapped reads from Williams 82 covered the entire fourth exon by the four amplicons (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the reads from PGC010 were mapped to a part of the fourth exon, which could not be mapped because of absence of the fourth exon in PGC010. When we confirmed the sequence of the mapped reads, these are found to contain several polymorphic sites originated from another region (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The primer pair of AMPL1040313 was found to have a similar (2- and 1-bp mismatches in the forward and reverse primers) sequence to that of the E3 homologous gene on Chr3 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). A comparison of sequence of the original amplicon designed for the E3 gene on Chr19 with that designed for the phyA gene on Chr3 revealed that the amplicon of phyA could be mapped preferentially to E3 in the absence of sequence information (Supplementary Fig. S3C). To preferentially output the alignment containing indel, we changed the penalty parameter by using the option ‘-A 10 -M 60 -O 50 -E 1’ to TMAP. The default parameters of TMAP option are as follows: ‘-A’, score for a match [default = 1]; ‘-M’, the mismatch penalty [3]; ‘-O’, the indel start penalty [5]; and ‘-E’, the indel extension penalty [2]. By increasing the penalty values related to base match and InDels, the miss-mapped reads on the fourth exon can be reduced from 2,426 (default parameter) to 3 reads (Fig. 3A). By optimizing these parameters, the miss-mapped reads on the second exon of E3 were also mapped to the correct position, phyA on Chr3 (second exon; Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4). We also investigated whether the 15-kb deletion can be detected using the read coverage. The APKM of the four amplicons located at the fourth exon of E3 was compared between the E3 and e3tr alleles (Fig. 3B). The number of accessions classified as E3 and e3tr by additional marker analysis was 152 and 36, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). The APKM of four amplicons on the fourth exon of the e3tr allele was almost zero, whereas the APKM of the E3 allele varied depending on the accessions, and it was difficult to judge the presence or absence of deletion from the APKM of each amplicon. However, it was possible to classify the presence or absence of deletion clearly (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table S7) when the average APKM of the four amplicons was used instead, because differences in amplification efficiency due to sequence variation at the priming site can be cancelled using the APKM of multiple amplicons.

As the AmpliSeq technology has been mainly used in animals in which palaeopolyploidy is considerably rare, no such limitation has been reported. Soybean is an ancient tetraploid, which underwent two whole-genome duplications (palaeopolyploidy); most of the genes have paralogous genes with multiple copies.23 The information provided above would be useful when the AmpliSeq technology is applied to plant species, which have experienced whole-genome duplication or triplications.3.3. Detected variants of flowering time-related genesA total of 192 soybean mini-core collection was analysed to detect novel variants in flowering time-related genes by AmpliSeq. Among the 461 variants (SNPs or InDels) detected in the target regions, 311 (67.5%) sites have already been reported or registered in dbSNP,25 whereas 150 sites (32.5%) were novel (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S8). The variants detected were compared in depth with information of flowering time-related genes, E1, E2, E3, E4, FT2a, FT5a, and their homologues.3,17,18 Further, we performed linear regression analysis to detect responsible variants associated with flowering time under long-day field conditions. Among the 461 variants, 207, 206, and 219 were found to be potentially associated with flowering time in 2011, 2012, and 2013 by the simple linear regression analysis, respectively (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8). The most significantly associated variant with flowering time was SNP (rs124971350) at E2 (e2 allele) (P < 2.0e-16 for 3 yrs) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8). The second most significant variant was a large deletion in E3 (e3-tr allele) (P < 1.9e-13, 1.6e-13, and 5.2e-14 for 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively). The other seven genes, WD repeat-containing protein 61, Dt1, MADS-box protein, two genes of two-component response regulator-like genes, FT2a, and PhyB, showed highly significant association with flowering time (P < 0.0001) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8).Classification of detected variants of 28 flowering time-related genes by snpEff analysisHigh-impact variant to gene function includes criteria of stop lost, stop gained, and frameshift.Classification of detected variants of 28 flowering time-related genes by snpEff analysisHigh-impact variant to gene function includes criteria of stop lost, stop gained, and frameshift.DNA polymorphisms in nine genes significantly associated with flowering time variation in the mini-core collection as revealed by the single linear regression analysisGene names refer to those in Kong et al.,8 Fan et al.,52 and Cao et al.53DNA polymorphisms in nine genes significantly associated with flowering time variation in the mini-core collection as revealed by the single linear regression analysisGene names refer to those in Kong et al.,8 Fan et al.,52 and Cao et al.53Five alleles, E1, e1-as, e1-nl, e1-fs, and one novel missense (Chr06_20207355) were identified at E1 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S5A, and Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). In the other two B3 domain containing E1-like genes, only one synonymous variant (rs123097808) was detected in Glyma.04G156400/E1La, whereas no variant was detected in the coding region of Glyma.04G143300/E1Lb (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C). Among the five E1 alleles, the frequency of e1-as allele (Chr06:20207322 C: Williams 82 type) was 0.09 and Chr06:20207322 C to G nucleotide change (rs123612969) was 0.91 among the soybean mini-core collection. In contrast, e1-nl, which lacks the entire E1 gene,10 was only found in Swedish cultivar FiskebyV (PGC001) (Supplementary Table S9). This allele was determined by the read coverage at the E1 genomic region. The average normalized read coverage of all six amplicons (AMPL1037682–AMPL1037687) was three in PGC001, whereas that of these amplicons in the other accessions was 181 (ranging from 36 to 430). Additional experiments to confirm the deletion in the E1 genomic region by PCR amplification revealed that only PGC001 lacks the E1 genomic region among all accessions and possesses the e1-nl allele. Another allele, e1-fs, which had 1-bp deletion variant (Chr06_20207323) was also found in one accession PGC002 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S5A, and Supplementary Table S9). The deletion (Chr06_20207323) causes a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon at Lys76. These loss-of-function alleles were not included in the association analysis due to very low allele frequency (only one accession each), but might explain very early flowering of PGC001 and PGC002 under long-day-length field condition. PGC002 (Wase kuro daizu) is originated from the southern part of Japan and classified as the summer-type soybean, early-maturity group in low-latitude regions of Japan. The summer-type soybean has low photoperiod sensitivity, and e1-fs can explain this characteristic. In contrast, the novel missense (Chr06_20207355) from PGC139 and PGC147 (Supplementary Fig. S5A and Supplementary Table S9) did not show large effect on flowering time and might not significantly affect the E1 function.

The black and grey circles indicate loss-of-function (described as ‘HIGH’ impact on the gene function in Supplementary Table S8) and missense variants. Braces indicate known large InDels. These InDels can be detected by read depth.Two alleles, E2 and e2, and one novel SNP variant (Chr10_45310686) were detected at E2 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S5D, and Supplementary Table S8). Among them, functional defective e2 allele had A to T nucleotide change (Table 3, K528*, rs124971350) and the allele frequency among the soybean mini-core collection was 0.42 (Supplementary Table S8). A novel SNP (Chr10_45310686), which causes missense variant of Ile490Met, was detected only in PGC086 with the e2 allele (Supplementary Table S9 and Supplementary Fig. S5D).Among two alleles, e3-tr and e3-Mo, detected at E3, the frequency of e3-tr allele, which has a large deletion in the fourth exon, was 0.19 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S5E, and Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). The missense variant of e3-Mo (Chr19_47638302: G to A, Gly1050Arg) in the third exon of E3 was detected in PGC019 and PGC042 (Moshidou Gong 503)3 derived from Korean Peninsula and China, respectively. The e3-Mo variant is not registered in dbSNP, but we found in one Chinese landrace Ni Ding Hua Mei Dou from 302 soybean re-sequence data28 (SRR1533240 in NCBI SRA).The e4-SORE-1 allele has a 6.2-kb insertion in the first exon. It was difficult to estimate this insertion from the read coverage of amplicon in the region. However, the presence or absence of a large insertion could be estimated from the read coverage of amplicon (AMPL1037734) at the break point of a large insertion (Supplementary Fig. S5F). The average APKM of break point was 325 in the reference type sequence, whereas it was zero in the insertion type sequence of PGC001 and PGC021 derived from Sweden and Japan, respectively. This insertion was also confirmed by the PCR.Most SNPs (11 of 13 sites) in E4 were found from PGC123 and PGC134 derived from Nepal and China (Supplementary Table S9), but there was only one missense variant (rs390866037: Leu151Ser), which likely affects gene function. As these variants were detected as homozygous, they are considered to be real variants, not detected by the miss-mapped reads. A frameshift variant in the second exon was only found in PGC005 (Supplementary Table S9). This accession flowered earlier than Williams 82 under field conditions in spite of the same gene combination for all other flowering-related genes (Supplementary Table S1).Five variants, three frameshifts and two splice site variants, were identified to be high-impact variant to another PhyA gene, Glyma.03G227300/GmPHYA4 (Supplementary Fig. S5G and Supplementary Table S9). This PhyA gene consisted of two main haplotypes, namely, reference type (Hap1–Hap5) and pseudogene type (Hap6–Hap11), which had various loss-of-function sites. The other PhyA gene, Glyma.10G141400, had only one novel frameshift variant (Chr10_37491867) from two accessions, PGC045 and PGC189 derived from Korea and East Timor (Supplementary Tables S6 and S9 and Supplementary Fig. S5H).There has been no report of natural variation in the PhyB genes affecting flowering, but the overexpression of GmPHYB1 accelerates flowering under short-day conditions in Arabidopsis.29 Only one missense variant (rs124458274) was found from GmPHYB1 (Glyma.09G035500) (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5I). rs124458274 was a common variation in the mini-core collection (allele frequency = 0.69). Two novel frameshifts and six missense variants (one was novel) were found in the other PhyB gene Glyma.15G140000 (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5J). Although the frameshift variant (Chr15_11442094) was identified in the 19 accessions (Hap8, Supplementary Table S9), no association with flowering time under the examined field conditions was observed.Two florigen genes FT5a and FT2a in the soybean genome play a major role in the induction of flowering.17,18,30 As no variant was detected in the exon of FT5a, it appears that FT5a is highly conserved under the evolutionary constraint (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5K). Nine and five variants were detected in the intron and 3'-UTR, respectively. Of these, four variants were associated with flowering time determined by simple linear regression analysis (Supplementary Tables S3 and S8). Two variants (rs126630615 in 3'-UTR and rs126639618 in the third intron) were reported by Takeshima et al.18 This FT5a region has been reported to be one of the flowering time quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from a cross between Peking and Enrei.31 In this study, the nucleotide differences between Enrei and Peking were identified as rs126639616_1 (Fig. 4) in the intron and rs388994144_1 (Fig. 4) in the 3'-UTR region (Supplementary Fig. S5K and Supplementary Table S8). As natural variants in 5'- and 3'-UTR of the FT-like gene affect gene expression and flowering time in rice,32,33 the variant rs388994144_1 in 3'-UTR region might be involved in gene expression of FT5a and regulation of flowering time in soybean.The FT2a is a paralogue of FT5a and has been named as E9.8,E9 is a leaky allele that is caused by allele-specific transcriptional repression due to the insertion of SORE-1 into the first intron. The presence of SORE-1 (FT2a-TO allele) delays flowering for 10 days under natural day-length conditions at Harbin, China (45°43'N, 126°45'E).8 Zhao et al.17 also reported a difference of 10 days or more in flowering time between E9 and e9 in Sapporo, Japan (43°07'N, 141°35'E). As we did not design the primers on the intron of FT2a, the presence or absence of SORE-1 is unknown. In this study, one frameshift and two missense variants were found in FT2a (Glyma.16G150700) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5L). In the first exon, missense SNP rs388788554 (Glu23Asp) was detected in PGC066 (Hap13, Supplementary Table S9). In the fourth exon, missense novel SNP (Chr16_31114633) was detected in seven accessions (Hap10, Supplementary Table S9). Another novel frameshift variant (Chr16_31111088) in the fourth exon was detected in PGC166 (Hap14, Supplementary Table S9). Enrei had four known and two novel variants in the intron and 3'-UTR of FT2a, whereas there was no variant in Peking. As QTL is not reported in the FT2a region of the CSSL between Peking and Enrei,31 these variants might be not involved in the regulation of flowering time under the evaluation conditions of CSSLs.Four missense variants were detected in the other three FT homologues, rs126830445 in Glyma.16G151000 (GmFT2b/GmFTL5, Supplementary Fig. S5M), rs127848197 in Glyma.19G108200 (GmFT5b/GmFTL6, Supplementary Fig. S5O), a novel SNP (Chr16_35778390) in Glyma.16G196300 (GmTFL3, Supplementary Fig. S5N), and Chr16_4162554 in Glyma.16G044200 (FT3a/GmFTL1, Supplementary Fig. S5P). The frequency of rs126830445 in GmFT2b/GmFTL5 was 0.45, whereas that of rs127848197 in GmFT5b/GmFTL6 was 0.94. A novel missense (Val98Ile) SNP (Chr16_35778390) in GmTFL3 was only found in PGC037. This accession (YAKUMO MEAKA) is a landrace from Hokkaido, northern part of Japan. In contrast, a novel missense variant (Chr16_4162554) in FT3a/GmFTL1 was only found in PGC134 (Hap7, Supplementary Table S9), which is a medium-maturing accession. No functional defect or missense variant in the other FT-like genes, Glyma.02G069500 (GmFTL7, Supplementary Fig. S5Q), Glyma.08G363100 (GmFT4, Supplementary Fig. S5R), and Glyma.08G363200 (GmFTL6, Supplementary Fig. S5S), was found. No variants were detected in Glyma.19G108100 (GmFT3b/GmFTL2). The information of alleles identified in these FT-like genes will be useful to clarify the influence of these variants on flowering regulation.Two TFL1-like genes, GmTFL2 (Glyma.03G194700) and GmTFL1 (Glyma.19G194300), exist in the soybean genome. No loss-of-function or missense variant was found in GmTFL2 (Supplementary Fig. S5T), whereas five missense variants were found in GmTFL1, which determine the growth habit of soybean, classically named as Dt1 locus34 (Supplementary Fig. S5U and Supplementary Table S8). These sites are located where amino acids are highly conserved across TFL1 orthologues: GmTFL2, GmTFL1/Dt1, Lotus japonicas CEN/TFL1, pea TFL1a, Arabidopsis TFL1, Arabidopsis ATC, and Antirrhinum majus CEN.35–39 The variant site of rs745009806 (Arg130Lys) was conserved in TFL, but not in ATC and CEN. Another four variant sites, rs127928577 (Arg62Ser), rs392653457 (Leu67Gln), rs127928574 (Pro113Leu), and rs127928573 (Arg166Trp), exist at a highly conserved amino acid site. Of these, rs127928573 (Arg166Trp) is known as dt1 allele in soybean.34 As the loss-of-function Sidt1 allele has been reported at S79N in Sesamum indium L.,40 the other three missense variants should be examined to verify whether they are new defective dt1 alleles or not.Among three two-component response regulator-like genes screened, the stop-lost variant (rs125308117) and five missense variants were found in Glyma.12G073900 (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5V). The allele frequency of the stop-lost variant (rs125308117) was 0.31. In Glyma.19G260400, only seven missense variants were found (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5W). Among seven variants with high impact on gene function in Glyma.U034500 on scaffold 32 (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5), four were frameshift variants due to InDels. Frameshift variant (A > AT, M737I, Scaffold32: 198773) was the major allele, and 82% of the mini-core collection possesses this allele. In contrast, other frameshift variants of insertion (C > CT, Q759M, scaffold_32: 198706) from PGC044, deletion (TTGCC > -, G409D, scaffold_32: 200001) from 16 accessions, and deletion (AC > A, V355L, scaffold_32: 200258) from three accessions, PGC005, PGC094, and PGC174, were rare alleles in the mini-core collection (Supplementary Table S9). The remaining three variants (scaffold_32_199043, scaffold_32_202754, and scaffold_32_218486) with high impact on gene function were stop-gained variant. These results indicate that Glyma.U034500 of most soybean accessions, except for Hap1, Hap2, Hap3, and Hap4 (Supplementary Table S9), losses its function. Among these three genes, Glyma.12G073900 and Glyma.U034500 showed high similarity (91%) at the amino acid sequence level. The fact that length of the amino acid sequence of Glyma.12G073900 of Williams 82 is shorter (92 aa) than that of Glyma.U034500 (765 aa) at the C terminal indicates that Glyma.12G073900 encodes truncated protein. Although flowering control by two-component response regulator-like genes has been reported in various species,41–43 the role of this gene and its variant in soybean flowering are unknown. Among the two-component response regulator-like genes, only variants in Glyma.12G073900 and Glyma.U034500 were associated with flowering time, determined by simple linear regression analysis (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8). Glyma.U034500 (Chr11 11.23-11.26Mb on Gmax189) is located near a previously reported QTL as qFT-B1 (nearest marker: Satt519 74.7cM, Chr11 13.98Mb on Gmax189) in the 96 from the cross between Tokei 780 and the soja accession Hidaka 4.44 Although they reported the effect of qFT-B1 is 3.4–10.8 days, the genotype of this frameshift site (Scaffold 32:198773) in the parent of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) is unknown. It can be confirmed using the detected variants as a DNA marker whether detected stop-lost and stop-gained variants in two-component response regulator-like genes are responsible genes for the flowering time.Seven missense variants were identified in Glyma.16G200700 encoding MADS box protein, whereas functional defect variant was not found (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5Y). MADS-domain transcription factor of the AGL6 gene is known to be a factor responsible for the regulation of lateral organ development, flowering time, and circadian clock in Arabidopsis.45,46,AGL6 regulates flowering through the FLC family genes and FT.46 Two missense variants, rs389022394 and rs126888609, on Glyma.16G200700 are significantly associated with the flowering time, determined by the simple linear regression analysis (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8). As there is no report for FLC-like genes in soybean, it will be important to examine whether the detected two variants from Glyma.16G200700 have an effect on the flowering time.One novel frameshift variant (Chr17_3955763) of WD repeat-containing protein 61 (Glyma.17g52100) was significantly associated with flowering time, determined by the simple linear regression analysis (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8). Although the allele frequency of the frameshift variant was 0.52 (Supplementary Table S8), no QTL has been reported in this region. In Arabidopsis, WD repeat-containing protein VIP3 regulates flowering time via the vernalization pathway;47 however, the vernalization pathway is not known in soybean and it is difficult to infer the role. As a large proportion of the mini-core collection has the novel frameshift variant for Glyma.17G052100 and missense variant for Glyma.16G200700, it is necessary to confirm genetically whether these novel variants really affect the flowering time. The transcription factor gene, Glyma.17G090500, was sequenced as the control for variant detection. All known variants were detected correctly (data not shown).3.4. Gene-based association test for flowering timeTo refine responsible variants associated with variation in flowering time in the mini-core collection, we performed multiple linear regression analysis using variants significantly associated with flowering time in the simple linear regression analysis. The variants of e2, e3-tr and stop-lost variant (rs125308117) of two-component response regulator-like gene on Chr12 were significant in 3 yrs, and rs127928573 in Dt1 was significant only in 2013 (Table 4). These genes could explain 51.82%, 51.13%, and 52.83% of the phenotypic variation of flowering time among the mini-core collection in 3 yrs, respectively. In this study, the variants of E1 and E4 could not be incorporated into the association analysis due to the low frequency of e1-nl (0.5%) and e4-SORE1 (1%) alleles in the mini-core collection. The extent of variation explained in this study was ~10% lower than 62–66% reported by Zhai et al.48 Even though the allele frequency of e1-as was relatively high (9%), e1-as was not significant in the multiple linear regression analysis. This is probably because the genetic effect of e1-as is smaller than that of E2, E3, and two-component response regulator-like gene. In the simple linear regression analysis, the P-value of E2 (2.0e-16), E3 (5.2e-14–1.9e-13), and two-component response regulator-like gene (7.7e-11–1.8e-8) was considerably lower than that of e1-as (0.015–0.033) (Table 3). Further experiment using a larger population size is required to examine the remaining variation that could not be explained by the three genes with e1-as.DNA polymorphisms responsible for flowering time variation in the mini-core collection as revealed by multiple regression analysisMAF: minor allele frequency; s.e.: standard error.Physical position on Gmax275.Gene description was obtained from Phytozome 12.Effect to gene function annotated by snpEff.

Signification codes: ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05.Large deletion on E3 estimated by coverage of four amplicon on 4th exon.The other five genes, namely, WD repeat-containing protein 61 (Glyma.17G052100), MADS-box protein (Glyma.16G200700), PhyB (Glyma.15G140000), two-component response regulator-like gene (Glyma.U034500), and FT2a/GmFTL3 (Glyma.16G150700), were significant in the simple linear regression analysis (P < 0.0001) but not significant in the multiple linear regression analysis (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S8). Variants that differ between Enrei and Peking can be used to confirm allele effect on flowering time using the phenotypic data of CSSLs.31 Peking had a novel frameshift variant (Chr17_3955763) in WD repeat-containing protein 61 (Glyma.17G052100), two missense variants (rs389022394 and rs126888609) in MADS-box protein (Glyma.16G200700), and one frameshift variant (Chr15_11442094) in PhyB (Glyma.15G140000), and no variant in Enrei (Supplementary Table S8). However, no flowering time QTL has been reported to Chr17, Chr16, and Chr15; these genes may not be involved in flowering time regulation under the evaluation conditions of CSSLs.31It was the stop-gain allele E2 that showed the highest association with flowering time. The effect of this variant promotes flowering about 5 days (Table 4). Watanabe et al.11 reported that the difference in days to flowering between E2/E2 and e2/e2 was ~9 days, which is consistent with the result of this study. The next strong association with flowering time was observed at E3. The e3-tr allele (Horosy-e3) has been reported to promote flowering for ~17 days,13 but it was estimated as 9–13 days in this study. The smaller estimation at E3 can be explained by the absence of e3-Mo allele. As there are only two accessions, PGC019 and PGC042 (Supplementary Table S9), the e3-Mo allele could not be included in the association analysis.The effect of the missense variant (rs127928573, Arg166Trp) of Dt1 was detected only for 2013 data set; it delayed flowering by ~11 days compared with that by the Dt1 allele (Table 4). Dt1 is reported as the locus strongly associated with days to maturity and plant height.49 Zhang et al.49 identified the Dt1 gene at 18.6-kb upstream of the peak SNP, which was associated with days to maturity and plant height. Dt1 plays a primary role in not only stem termination but also floral transition.50,51 As no visible influence on the flowering time has been reported with dt1 VIGS-induced suppression,34 the detected SNP on Dt1 in this study suggests the presence of other gene in the surrounding region related to the flowering time.The effect of stop-lost variant (rs125308117) in the two-component response regulator-like gene (Glyma.12G073900) was significant (P = 4.5 e-3 in 2011, P = 1.0 e-2 in 2012, P = 3.5 e-3 in 2013), and the plant flowers ~10–13 days later. Involvement of the two-component response regulator-like gene in flowering time has been reported in Arabidopsis and rice; it may be functionally preserved as a flowering time-related gene in soybean. Williams 82 (reference genome) has C-terminal truncated protein as described above, whereas the rs125308117 variant has longer amino acid sequence and allele effect of delayed flowering for 4.7 days (Table 4). Although Glyma.12G073900 is located near a previously reported QTL as qFT-H (nearest marker: Satt442 on Chr12: 6,390,806–6,391,062) in RILs with the E1 allele from the cross between Tokei 780 and the soja accession Hidaka 4,44 the allele type of Glyma.12G073900 in both accessions is unknown. The genomic region surrounding Glyma.12G073900 has been reported to include flowering time QTL qDFF-Gm12 in CSSLs.31,Glyma.12G073900 of Peking (PGC084) is the stop-lost type (longer protein), whereas that of Enrei (PGC025) is reference type (truncated protein). Similar to the present study, Peking allele delayed flowering by ~3.7 days (LOD score is 36.3, flanking markers: C12-BARC- 015603-02006 and s024200450).31 These data suggest that Glyma.12G073900 is one of the candidate gene for qDFF-Gm12.4. ConclusionsFlowering time and maturity are the most important factors affecting adaptability and yield. To increase the yield of soybean, it is necessary to control flowering time at an appropriate time using a combination of flowering time-related genes or alleles. Preparing a catalogue of flowering time-related genes makes it possible to freely combine alleles with various effects using the DNA markers. Our results indicate that novel alleles and accessions with such novel alleles can be rapidly detected using the AmpliSeq technology. Although multiple defective alleles were identified, we could not include all of them in the association study of flowering time due to low allele frequency. Nevertheless, the variants detected in this study could explain 51.1–52.3% of the flowering time variation in the soybean mini-core collection. These variants consisted of a novel two-component response regulator gene besides known flowering time-related genes. Therefore, the AmpliSeq technology is useful for discovering novel variants in the target genes.Data availabilityAll sequences analysed in this study have been deposited in the DDBJ database under the BioProject Accession number: PRJDB7633.We thank Naoki Kamei and Osamu Takahashi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Technologies, Japan Ltd.) for sequencing using Ion S5 XL and offering technical support in using the Ion S5 sequencer.

IntroductionRNA editing represents a widespread post-transcriptional modification that enhances transcriptome diversity by changing RNA sequences.1 The extensive application of next-generation sequencing has greatly facilitated the identification of RNA editing. An astonishingly large number of RNA editing sites have been confidently detected in humans, mice, and other species, demonstrating that RNA editing is pervasive in the genome.2–7 Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most prevalent form of RNA editing in mammals. This process is catalysed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA family of enzymes (ADARs).8 Following deamination of adenosine to inosine (I) by ADARs, the modified base is recognized as guanosine (G) by the cellular machinery during translation.1,9 It is probable that A-to-I RNA editing in protein-coding regions may result in amino acid sequence changes that affect other transcriptional processes in particular tissues or developmental stages.1,9 Amino acid changes caused by A-to-I editing may influence the propagation of fast electrical and chemical signals transmitted via ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors in animal nervous systems.10,11 In addition, A-to-I RNA editing is essential for normal vertebrate development because it regulates gene expression by affecting alternative splicing, microRNA target recognition, and other biological processes.12–16The pig (Sus scrofa) is an important protein source for humans and a widely used model organism in biomedical research.9,17–19 In comparison with rodents, pigs have a longer gestational period (about 114 days). Since it is difficult to collect prenatal skeletal muscle samples from humans and rodents, the pig is a valuable model organism for studying skeletal muscle development.20–22 Moreover, pigs share anatomical, developmental, physiological, metabolic, and genomic properties with humans.17 Skeletal muscle development is a highly complex and genetically well-programmed process controlled by cascades of myogenesis genes.23,24 Recent studies suggest that RNA editing contributes to myogenesis25 and that the editing level in skeletal muscle is relatively low compared with that of other tissues.2,26 ADAR enzymes catalyse the deamination of adenosine to inosine and play important roles in the myoblast-to-myotube transition because they are targets of muscle-specific myomiRs such as miRNA-1/206.25 AIMP2 inhibits RNA editing in muscle cells by promoting degradation of ADAR1/2 proteins.2 These observations imply that A-to-I editing plays an essential role in myogenesis. Currently, the mammalian skeletal muscle editome and the manner in which it changes during development are poorly understood.26,27Here, we constructed a comprehensive dynamic atlas of the S. scrofa RNA editome in skeletal muscle across 27 developmental stages by integrating whole genome sequencing (WGS), genome-wide bisulphite sequencing (WGBS), and strand-specific rRNA-depleted total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of RNA editing in skeletal muscle. The findings of this study suggest that RNA editing is a vital, but underappreciated, mechanism involved in regulating skeletal muscle development.2. Materials and methods2.1 Sample collectionSkeletal muscle (longissimus dorsi) samples were collected from Landrace (L) pigs at 27 developmental stages, including embryonic days 33, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, and 105 (abbreviated as LE33, LE40, LE45, LE50, LE55, LE60, LE65, LE70, LE75, LE80, LE85, LE90, LE95, LE100, and LE105) and postnatal days 0, 9, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180 (abbreviated as LD0, LD9, LD20, LD30, LD40, LD60, LD80, LD100, LD120, LD140, LD160, and LD180). The experimental pigs were allowed access to feed and water ad libitum and were housed under identical conditions before slaughtering. After copulation with the boar, the sows and piglets were sacrificed at a commercial slaughter house at the selected stages. At each stage, skeletal muscle samples from three pigs were harvested as biological replicates. All samples were stored immediately in liquid nitrogen. All animal procedures were performed according to the protocols of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.2.2 Construction of RNA-seq, WGS, and WGBS librariesFor the RNA-seq experiments, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), followed by rRNA depletion and DNaseI treatment (Qiagen). Strand-specific RNA-seq libraries for paired-end sequencing were prepared using the Illumina Ribo-Zero protocol. For each stage, three independent biological libraries were constructed. The libraries were sequenced to generate paired-end reads with 150-bp read lengths using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. Approximately 100 million reads were acquired for each sample.For WGS, genomic DNA was isolated from the ear tissue of a Landrace male pig with the same genetic background as the animals from which the samples used for RNA-seq was collected. The DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) was used for isolation of DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Qualified DNA was sonicated into 350-bp fragments using a Covaris S220 ultrasonicator (Covaris). Libraries were constructed according to the standard operating procedure provided by Illumina. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, and 125-bp paired-end reads were generated.The samples from the RNA-seq experiment were also used for WGBS. After DNA extraction, DNA was fragmented into 200–300 bp fragments with a Covaris S220 ultrasonicator (Covaris), followed by end repair and A-ligation. Cytosine-methylated barcodes were ligated to the sonicated DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA fragments were treated twice with bisulphite using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold™ Kit (Zymo Research). The libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform, and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated by Novogene (Novogene, Beijing, China).2.3 Sequencing mapping and single-nucleotide variation callingFor each library, high-quality reads were obtained after removing reads containing adapters, reads containing poly-N sequences, and low-quality reads using in-house Perl scripts. The remaining clean, high-quality reads were used for subsequent analyses.The RNA and DNA reads were aligned to the S. scrofa reference genome (downloaded from Ensembl, v11.1) by BWA (v0.7.17). The paired reads were mapped separately using the commands ‘bwa aln’ and ‘bwa sampe’, with only four mismatches allowed. Reads that uniquely mapped (q > 10) to the reference genome were kept by Samtools (v1.6).28 PCR duplicates that mapped to the same locations were removed by the MarkDuplicates tool from the Picard software package (v2.17.0), and only the read with the highest mapping quality was retained. The unique reads were subjected to local realignment around indels and base quality score recalibration using the IndelRealigner and BaseRecalibrator tools, respectively, from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, v3.4). The HaplotypeCaller tool from GATK was used to call variants.For WGBS reads, the S. scrofa reference genome was first transformed to a bisulphite-converted version (C-to-T and G-to-A conversion) and then indexed using bowtie2.29 Bismark software (v 0.12.5) was used to perform alignments of bisulphite-treated reads to the reference genome using the default parameters.30 The sequencing depth and coverage of methylcytosine were summarized after removing duplicate reads. Bis-SNP software was used to call variants for the WGBS data.31Reliable SNP sites were identified using stringent criteria, which required at least 10 sequencing reads at these sites and a high-quality score (q > 25). Sites with two or more variants were discarded. At least three reads with high quality were required to support the variant form to eliminate false positives due to amplification bias or sequencing error.2.4 Identifying RNA editing sitesIn order to accurately identify RNA editing sites in pig skeletal muscle, a computational pipeline was developed to make reliable calls on RNA editing sites (Supplementary Fig. S1) as reported in previous studies,2,32–34 but with slight modifications. In brief, to remove false-positive RNA editing sites, the variants called by RNA-seq were filtered by the following steps: (i) SNPs that were genotyped as heterozygous variants using the WGS and WGBS data were discarded; (ii) All known SNPs present in the SNP database were filtered out (dbSNP; database version 150, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/variation/vcf/sus_scrofa/); (iii) Intronic sites that occurred within 4 bp of splice junctions were discarded; (iv) Variants in homopolymer runs were discarded; (v) Because of the relatively high error rate of Illumina sequencing towards both ends of a read, variants that occurred within 6 bp of both ends of a read were removed; (vi) The remaining candidate sites were checked with BLAT alignment filtering, and sites in regions highly similar to other regions of the genome were discarded. The remaining variants were considered as candidate RNA editing sites and annotated by snpEff (v4.3t)35 based on Ensembl gene annotation (release 90).2.5 Data analysisFor an RNA editing site in a given skeletal muscle sample, the A-I RNA editing level was quantified as the ratio of the number of G reads to the total number of A and G reads covering the site. The overall editing rate of each sample was determined as the total number of reads with G at all candidate editing positions compared with all A and G reads covering the editing positions.2 For the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, we removed all sites that were missing editing measurements in more than 27 (one-third) of the samples. Only editing sites in transcript regions were used for the MDS analysis. The missing values of the editing sites were imputed using the missForest R package with default settings. The ‘cmdscale’ function in R was used for the MDS analysis.A cluster of editing sites was defined as the occurrence of three or more candidate sites within a 100-bp window. Genes that contained at least five editing sites and one clustered region were defined as hyper-edited genes. The sequence spanning 200 bp upstream and downstream of the editing site or cluster was used to predict the secondary structure and to calculate the minimum free energy using the RNAfold programme in the ViennaRNA package.36 The binding sites and energies of miRNAs were predicted using Miranda software (v3.3a)37 with default values. Mature miRNA sequences of S. scrofa were obtained from miRBase (release 21).38 Two types of sequences with regions flanking (50 bp upstream and downstream) the editing sites were prepared for target prediction: reference sequences and A-to-I editing sequences.For gene expression analysis, RNA-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome using Hisat2 (v2.0.4) with the parameter –rna-strandness RF, while the other parameters were set to their default values. The expression levels of genes were quantified by calculating fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments (FPKM) values using StringTie (v1.3.1) in a reference-based approach.39 Gene annotation file was obtained from Ensembl (release 90). Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website (v6.7, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).40For conservation analysis, we converted the coordinates of all pig A-to-G RNA editing sites to positions on the human and mouse reference genomes using liftOver tools and the chain files (susScr11ToHg38.over.chain.gz and susScr11ToMm10.over.chain .gz) provided by the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu). The known human and mouse A-to-I editing sites were downloaded from the RADAR (v2, http://rnaedit.com/)41 and REDIportal (http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/)42 databases. The human A-to-I editing sites in these two databases were merged. In total, 4,627,557 human A-to-I editing sites and 8,824 mouse A-to-I editing sites were used for the conservation analysis.2.6 Editing changes and co-editing network analysisA-to-I editing sites with less than one-third of values missing were selected from the 81 samples and used to identify differentially editing sites to ensure adequate statistical power. A multiple linear regression model with development stage and sex was developed to identify editing changes associated with skeletal muscle development or sex. Edited sites were considered to be significantly associated with skeletal muscle development or sex if they passed the FDR-corrected significance threshold of P = 0.05.Weighted gene co-edited network analysis (WGCNA)43 was used to identify distinct modules of co-edited sites. A total of 9,478 editing sites with no missing values and editing in more than 10 samples (editing level >0) were used to construct co-editing modules. We chose the best soft-thresholding 4, which was the lowest power for which the scale-free topology fit index reached the R2 cut-off (>0.9). Modules with eigengenes that were highly correlated (above 0.8) were merged to assess their relationship with skeletal muscle development. We identified 13 co-editing modules with minModuleSize = 30. The correlations between module eigengenes and phenotypic traits (development stage and sex) were used to identify modules associated with development or sex.2.7 Database constructionThe database was composed of a web interface and a MariaDB database engine, which is used to store and manage all data. The web interface is composed of native HTML elements. The data processing and customer/service interaction programmes were written in PHP (v5.4.16) and JavaScript (v1.10.2). The search results are shown by asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) serves belonging to JavaScript. Baidu ECharts (http://echarts.baidu.com/index.html) are used to exhibit the editing level of editing sites at 27 developmental stages of skeletal muscle. The web services were built using nginx (v2.10.0), an HTTP and reverse proxy server. JBrowse (version 1.14.2) genome browser is used to display the positional relationships between genes and genome annotations.442.8 Validation of RNA editing by Sanger sequencingTo validate the reliability of RNA editing events identified by RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis, we randomly selected 18 regions containing 104 editing sites for PCR validation. The gDNA and RNA samples used for PCR validation were those used for RNA-seq. Total RNA was firstly reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The selected regions were amplified from the gDNA and cDNA samples using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were then subjected to Sanger sequencing. To verify the RNA editing level calculated from the RNA-seq reads, the PCR products were gel-purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and subcloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Osaka, Japan) to produce TA clones. Finally, 42–50 clones from each sample were randomly picked for Sanger sequencing. The editing level of each editing site was calculated as the number of clones with the edited nucleotides compared with the total number of sequenced clones.2.9 Western blot analysisTotal protein was isolated from pig skeletal muscle using a Protein Extraction Kit (TransGen Biotech, China). Western blotting was performed as previously described.45 The anti-ADAR1 antibody (SC-73208) and anti-ADAR2 antibody (Abp50601) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) and Amy Jet Scientific (Guangzhou, China), respectively. The anti-GAPDH antibody (bs-2188R) and secondary antibody (bs0295G-HRP) were obtained from Bioss (Beijing, China). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.10 Vector construction, cell culture, and dual luciferase reporter assayThree editing sites in the 3'-UTRs of the AVPR1A, TMX4, and ACTN2 genes (chr5:27,827,411, chr17:16,833,004, and chr14:54,710,988) were randomly selected to verify whether A-to-I editing can affect miRNA binding. The 3'-UTR fragments flanking the miRNA binding sites of these three genes (without editing, 3'-UTR-wt) were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were cloned into the pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase Vector using the SacI and XhoI restriction sites. The mutant types corresponding to the RNA editing sites (3'-UTR-edt) in these three genes were made by site-directed mutagenesis (Takara) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The negative control duplexes and miR-21, miR-378 and miR-133b mimics (double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides) were synthesized by GenePharma. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pmirGLO-3'UTR-wt plasmid/3' UTR-edt and the miRNA mimic/negative control. Co-transfection assays were performed in 12-well plates with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection for 24 h, cells were harvested. Finally, renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase were detected with the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega).The effect of a selected A-to-I editing site (chr6:107,039,734) in the 3'-UTR of the MIB1 gene on MIB1 expression was evaluated. The mutation in the MIB1 3'-UTR was made by site-directed mutagenesis (Takara) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The edited and wild-type MIB1 3'-UTRs were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector. Luciferase activity and the expression level of firefly luciferase were detected to evaluate the effect of this editing site on MIB1 mRNA stability.3. Results3.1 Systematic identification of the S. scrofa RNA editome in skeletal muscleTo profile the dynamic patterns of RNA editing during skeletal muscle development, we carried out strand-specific RNA-seq in skeletal muscle across 27 developmental stages (SRA accession number SRP158448), including 15 prenatal and 12 postnatal stages, ranging from 33 days after conception to 180 days after birth. A total of 8.2 billion paired-end reads (150 bp × 2) were obtained from 81 transcriptome libraries. A WGS library (SRA accession number SRP157242), which was based on DNA isolated from the ear tissue of an adult male pig with the same genetic background as the pigs from which the samples were collected for RNA-seq, was sequenced. Additionally, our group previously performed WGBS (SRA accession number SRP160645) on the same skeletal muscle samples used for RNA-seq to understand the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation during skeletal muscle development (data not shown). Because differences in DNA and RNA sequence were found to be mainly caused by RNA editing, the WGS and WGBS data were also used in the process of filtering out false-positive DNA-RNA differences caused by heterozygous SNPs. A total of 56.88 billion paired-end reads (150 bp × 2) were obtained from 81 methylome libraries, and 909.92 million paired-end reads (125 bp × 2) were obtained from the WGS library, representing a genome-wide coverage depth of approximately 35× and 47×, respectively. These multi-omic datasets with relatively deep coverage provided an extensive dataset for profiling the RNA editome of developing skeletal muscle.Based on the multi-omic dataset mentioned above, we identified 236,569 putative RNA editing sites in skeletal muscle using a pipeline similar to those used in previous studies2,32–34 with slight modifications (Supplementary Fig. S1). We detected four major variant types, including A-to-I (G), T-to-C, G-to-A, and C-to-T editing. Most of these sites (approximately 84%) were produced by A-to-I editing (Fig. 1a). It is noteworthy that C-to-T SNPs in the sample cannot be distinguished from C-to-T substitutions that are caused by bisulphite conversion in WGBS, thus the C-to-U and G-to-A editing sites might be false-positive results and must be filtered from the datasets used in later analyses. Moreover, due to incomplete strand annotation and antisense transcription in the pig reference genome, T-to-C variants could also be considered as possible A-to-I editing sites. Taking these possibilities into consideration, A-to-I and T-to-C editing together accounted for 95.59% of all identified RNA variants (Fig. 1a). Subsequent analyses were mainly focused on A-to-I editing. To validate the RNA editing sites identified based on high-throughput sequencing data, 104 editing sites were randomly selected for experimental confirmation using PCR and Sanger sequencing. The results revealed that 86.5% (90/104) of the selected editing sites were successfully validated (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S2). These experiments showed that the editing levels calculated by the pipeline used in this study were positively correlated with the editing levels obtained by TA-clonal sequencing (Pearson’s r = 0.78, Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table S3). These findings suggest that the identification pipeline is reliable and suitable for use in future studies. Identification and classification of the S. scrofa RNA editome in skeletal muscle.

The proportion of A-to-I editing sites not residing in repeat elements is indicated by the grey bar.Among A-to-I editing sites, 79.6% of sites were located in intronic regions, followed by intergenic (16.3%) and 3'-UTR (3.6%) regions, while only 379 (0.19%) sites overlapped with protein coding sequences (CDS) (Fig. 1d). A-to-I editing accounted for 58.6% of all RNA variants in the CDS region (Supplementary Fig. S3a). These findings are consistent with reports of depletion of editing sites in the CDS of mammals.46–48 Within the editing sites in CDS, 45.9% (174/379) of RNA editing led to changes in amino acids in the encoded proteins (Fig. 1d). Glutamine to arginine (Q-to-R) and threonine to alanine (T-to-A) were the most frequent substitution types (Supplementary Fig. S3b). Meanwhile, the largest fraction of editing sites (77.2%) clearly occurred in clusters on chromosomes. Editing sites in CDS were less likely to be clustered in comparison with editing sites in other genomic elements (Fig. 1e). Moreover, 95.6% of the A-to-I editing sites were found in repeat elements (Fig. 1f). Our data revealed that a substantial proportion of repetitive editing sites (96.2%) were located within SINE/tRNA elements (Supplementary Fig. S4a), although SINEs represented only approximately 10% of the pig genome.17 This analysis showed that 67.34% of repetitive editing sites within SINE/tRNA elements were located in the Pre0_SS element, a SINE element of the PRE-1 family (Supplementary Fig. S4b).3.2 Characteristics of A-to-I editing in pig skeletal muscleIn general, RNA editing levels tended to be low at most editing sites in skeletal muscle, with an average editing rate of 4.6% (Fig. 2a), which was consistent previous studies of other mammals.2,46,49 The sequence and structure around editing sites affected recognition of double-stranded structures by ADARs within their substrates. First, the sequence and structural characteristics of the identified A-to-I editing sites were assessed. As observed in humans,4,7 the sequence around the A-to-I editing sites revealed a strong guanine deficiency one base upstream (~4.4%) of the editing sites, as well as a strong guanine preference one base downstream (~47.9%) of the editing sites (Fig. 2b). We also detected a large number of genes with widespread editing sites in exonic regions (490 genes with =5 editing sites, Supplementary Fig. S5). The top two hyper-edited genes were ENSSSCG00000040433 and LAMP2, which harboured 70 and 45 editing sites, respectively, in their 3'-UTRs (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S6). These findings may suggest a special regulatory mechanism at the post-transcriptional level for gene expression. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the hyper-edited genes were functionally related to the cell cycle and cell division (Fig. 2d).

(d) GO enrichment analysis of hyper-edited genes that contained at least five editing sites. The top ten biological processes that were reported by DAVID are shown.Next, conserved A-to-I editing sites across the pig, human, and mouse RNA editomes were identified. In comparison with the A-to-I editing sites in the RADAR and REDIportal databases,41,42 603 and 39 conserved editing sites between pig and human and between pig and mouse were identified, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7a). Moreover, 21 of these conserved sites were conserved among the human, mouse, and pig RNA editomes. Next, variation in conserved editing sites across the editomes was assessed among different mouse tissues. In the mouse, RNA-seq dataset from 10 organs and three postnatal skeletal muscles at 0, 20, and 60 days (SRA accession number SRP159202), 42 conserved edited sites were detected. The MDS analysis based on the editing levels of these sites was capable of separating the samples by tissue type (Supplementary Fig. S7b). Tissue profiling revealed that there were higher editing levels and an increase in the number of RNA editing sites in the brain in comparison with other tissues (Supplementary Fig. S7c).3.3 Dynamic changes in A-to-I RNA editing during skeletal muscle developmentThe frequency of editing sites and overall editing rate decreased with skeletal muscle development (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S8). Global levels of RNA editing changed significantly over the course of skeletal muscle development (r = -0.61, P = 1.08e-09). The MDS analysis showed that the first dimension explained approximately 10% of the editing variation across all samples, and the prenatal skeletal muscle samples were clearly segregated from the postnatal samples (Fig. 3b). The similar editing status between neighbouring stages reflected gradient changes in RNA editing in skeletal muscle with development. These results suggest that distinct editing profiles exist in prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscles. Dynamic landscape of A-to-I editing across skeletal muscle development.

The top ten biological processes that were reported by DAVID are shown.During skeletal muscle development, both the mRNA and protein expression levels of ADAR1 and ADAR2 were decreased (Fig. 3c and d); however, ADAR3 was expressed at a low level in all skeletal muscle samples. In addition, we found that the expression levels of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 were positively correlated with the overall editing rate (Fig. 3e). AIMP2 has been reported to be a negative regulator of A-to-I editing.2 We found its expression to be higher in skeletal muscle compared with other tissues in both pig (Supplementary Fig. S9a) and mouse (Supplementary Fig. S9b) and more abundant in postnatal muscles than in prenatal skeletal muscles (Supplementary Fig. S9c). There was significantly negative correlation between the expression of AIMP2 and ADAR1 (r = -0.23, P = 0.03, Supplementary Fig. S9d), and between the overall editing rate and AIMP2 expression level (r = -0.57, P = 2.48e-8, Fig. 3e) during skeletal muscle development.To identify the key co-editing sites associated with skeletal muscle development, we performed a WGCNA that identified 13 distinct modules of co-editing sites that shared similar editing patterns across skeletal muscle development. We used the eigengenes (the first principal component of each module) to assess the relationship of each module with skeletal muscle development and sex (Fig. 3f). The two largest modules were found to be significantly associated with skeletal muscle development (‘darkmagenta’, n = 4,658 sites, r = -0.81, P = 1e-19; ‘cyan’, n = 1,880 sites, r = 0.28, P = 0.01). Notably, the ‘darkmagenta’ module was also positively correlated with the overall editing rate (r = 0.83, P = 1e-21) (Fig. 3g). Eight editing sites in transcription factors MEF2A and MEF2C, which activate many muscle-specific genes during skeletal muscle growth and differentiation,50 were included in this module. GO analysis revealed that the ‘darkmagenta’ module was highly enriched for biological processes related to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, RNA splicing, and muscle organ development (Fig. 3h). These results reveal a strong correlation between RNA editing and skeletal muscle development.3.4 Differential RNA editing across skeletal muscle developmentWe performed multiple linear regression analysis to search for developmentally differential editing sites (dDESs) across skeletal muscle development. A total of 1,608 sites (0.95% of the 169,661 sites, FDR <0.05) showed significant editing rate differences (Fig. 4a and b, Supplementary Table S4). These dDESs were edited in the majority of the 81 tested skeletal muscle samples (average n = 42.5, Supplementary Fig. S10a). The top ranked up-regulated and down-regulated dDESs are shown in Fig. 4c. The distribution ratio of dDESs was relatively consistent across autosomal and X chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S10b). Two chromosomes showed significant enrichment of dDESs; 1.18% and 1.15% of editing sites were identified as significant dDESs in chromosome 6 (relative enrichment = 1.266, P = 0.002) and chromosome 3 (relative enrichment = 1.233, P = 0.022), respectively (Table 1). Additionally, dDESs were not equally distributed in different genic features. dDESs were significantly enriched in the 3'-UTR (3.81%, relative enrichment = 4.14, P = 8.58e-72) and 5'-UTR (4.50%, relative enrichment = 4.92, P = 3.97e-09). In contrast, dDESs were underrepresented in intronic regions (0.78%, relative enrichment = 0.82, P = 3.05e-07) (Supplementary Fig. S10c, Table 2). GO analysis revealed that genes harbouring at least one dDES were significantly associated with protein amino acid phosphorylation, muscle organ development and RNA splicing (Supplementary Fig. S10d). Of note, several dDESs were located in genes that play key roles in skeletal muscle development, including muscle-specific gene MEF2A, which controls cell growth, survival and apoptosis in skeletal muscle; skeletal muscle contractile gene MYH3; and SGCA, which affects fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscles.51 These results imply that RNA editing exhibited stage-specific patterns and might play an important role during skeletal muscle development. Additionally, no sex-bias editing sites reached the significance threshold of FDR =0.05 (Supplementary Fig. S11), implying that development was the major contributor to editing variation in skeletal muscle.Developmental A-to-I editing patterns and their potential functions during skeletal muscle development.

Only five dDESs were located in CDS regions, and four of these dDESs caused non-synonymous shifts, which were located in the DUSP11, DACT3, SACS, and CDK13 genes. DUSP11 negatively regulates members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation, and DACT3 is a key regulator of canonical and/or non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways during development.52 The editing level of the dDES (chr18:54,429,632) in the CDS of CDK13 were decreased during skeletal muscle development (Supplementary Fig. S10e). This gene is a member of the cyclin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase family and regulates cell-cycle progression and gene expression.53We next investigated the correlations between the editing rates of genic dDESs and the abundance of their host mRNAs. Most of the identified dDESs were positively or negatively correlated with host mRNA levels. The distribution of correlation coefficients was bimodal, and most dDESs exhibited significant positive or negative correlation with host mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S12a). For example, the editing level of editing site chr6:107,039,734, which is in the 3'-UTR of MIB1, was negatively correlated with MIB1 expression (r = -0.75, P = 4.73e-16). Our experiments validated that both luciferase activity and the expression level of firefly luciferase for the editing type were significantly lower than those associated with the wild type, confirming that this editing site significantly affected the expression of its host gene (Fig. 4d). However, no bimodal distribution of correlation coefficients was observed between all editing sites and their host gene expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S12b). Additionally, the correlation coefficients for 3'-UTR dDESs were significantly different from those of dDESs in intronic regions (Supplementary Fig. S12c), suggesting that dDESs in 3'UTRs have cis-regulatory potential that could impact gene expression by affecting stabilization or degradation of mRNAs.A functional relationship between RNA-editing and miRNA mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing has been reported.14,37,48,54 The binding energy between miRNA and target regions around the editing sites was computationally predicted. This analysis showed that 3'-UTRs with A-to-I editing had miRNA binding energies lower than those of 3'-UTRs without RNA editing (Welch’s t-test, t19,405 = -16.477, P < 2.2e-16) (Supplementary Fig. S13). To explore the potential negative impacts of dDESs on miRNA binding, we first determined whether dDESs in 3'-UTRs (264 sites) could be targeted by miRNAs. A total of 2,381 possible miRNA-3'UTR interaction pairs were predicted, among which 241 miRNA-3'-UTR pairs exhibited changes in binding energy (147 sites). Moreover, 88 editing sites may create miRNA binding sites with the potential to generate 129 new miRNA-3'-UTR interaction pairs. Additionally, 91 of the editing sites led to a disruption of miRNA recognition, which resulted in the loss of 126 possible miRNA-3'-UTR interactions (Fig. 4e). Three editing sites (chr5:27,827,411, chr17:16,833,004, and chr14:54,710,988) in the 3'-UTRs of AVPR1A, TMX4, and ACTN2 were selected for validation of their interactions with miRNAs. The dual luciferase reporter assay successfully validated the influence of RNA editing on the binding of miRNAs to mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 4f, miR-21 markedly decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type AVPR1A by binding to its 3'-UTR, while the edited form of AVPR1A was not susceptible to this effect (Fig. 4f). In comparison with the wild-type forms, the luciferase activities of TMX4 and ACTN2 with RNA editing in their 3'-UTRs were significantly decreased by miR-378 and miR-133b, respectively (Fig. 4f). These findings demonstrate that RNA editing regulates gene expression by affecting miRNA-mRNA interaction in skeletal muscle.3.6 Database of S. scrofa A-to-I editomeFinally, we developed a user-friendly and free database [the Database of RNA Editing in Pig (DREP)] that allows researchers to retrieve information about the A-to-I editing sites identified in the present study (http://www.rnanet.org/editing/home.html). Users can use the query interface and web interface of DREP to search RNA editing annotations, including their locations in the genome, genes, genic components (missense, synonymous, 5'-UTR, 3'-UTR, ncRNA, intronic, intergenic), repetitive elements (repetitive, non-repetitive), repetitive element family membership (Fig. 5a) and editing level in skeletal muscle across 27 development stages (Fig. 5b), as well as editing conservation across human and mouse. The locations of the editing sites in the genome can be seen using the Jbrowser. If an editing site located in the 3'-UTR and is targeted by miRNAs, the miRNA binding information is exhibited. The secondary structures of reference sequences and A-to-I editing sequences could also been seen in the website (Fig. 5c). To facilitate more detailed searches, DREP also provides the entire editing database contents as flat files for free download. This database serves as an informative and valuable data source for the study of RNA editing in mammalian skeletal muscle. Database for S. scrofa A-to-I RNA editing in skeletal muscle.

DiscussionWith the rapid adoption of genome re-sequencing and RNA-seq technologies, a large number of RNA editing sites in the genome have been identified in various species.2–7 However, RNA editing in developing skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive profiling of S. scrofa RNA editing in skeletal muscle across 27 developmental stages. Using multiple-omics datasets with high sequencing depth and coverage, including WGS, WGBS, and strand-specific RNA-seq data, we captured unprecedented editing events with low editing levels and in low depth regions. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of RNA editing in mammalian skeletal muscle.We detected a total of 236,569 RNA editing sites. Consistent with observations of RNA editing in other mammals,2,4,46 A-to-I editing appears to be the dominant form and accounted for 84% of all identified sites. The majority of the A-to-I editing sites occur in clusters, repetitive elements, and non-coding regions. In primates, A-to-I editing primarily occurs within Alu repeat elements,2,9 which are primate-specific SINEs. The pig genome is devoid of Alu repeat elements; thus, we confirmed that the majority of A-to-I editing occurred within SINE/tRNA elements in pig.26 Additionally, depletion of editing events and a reduced tendency towards clusters and editing site repeat elements were observed in CDS regions.46–48 The neighbour sequence preferences could be considered as a potential cis-regulatory mechanism.48 Our study suggested that the editing site had a strong aversion to G upstream of the editing site, while it had a preference for G downstream of the editing site; this preference agreed with the known substrate recognition characteristics of ADARs.55,56 A set of homologous editing sites was conserved across the human, mouse and pig editosomes, but more than half of the conserved sites in mice are also edited in humans. Additionally, 42 homologous sites in pig skeletal muscle were conserved and edited in mouse tissues, and none of these sites were edited in mouse postnatal skeletal muscles, confirming that RNA editing exhibits a high degree of spatiotemporal specificity.Our previous studies revealed that higher transcriptional activity and more complex molecular events occurred in prenatal skeletal muscles compared with postnatal skeletal muscles (data not published). We found that both the frequency and level of RNA editing were decreased across skeletal muscle development, which is contrary to observations in the brain.48,57 Previous studies have shown that RNA editing plays an important role in various developmental processes,12–14 but its role in skeletal muscle development has not been explored. ADAR family proteins constitute the key enzymatic activity for A-to-I editing. In mammals, ADAR1 and ADAR2 exhibits ubiquitous expression and are catalytically active, while ADAR3 is considered to be inactive.8 A previous study revealed that ADAR1 represses myotube maturation by targeting and modulating the expression of certain myogenesis-associated genes.25 Our results show that expression of ADAR1 underwent stage-specific alterations; the mRNA and protein levels of ADAR1/2 were down-regulated during skeletal muscle development, while ADAR3 was not expressed in skeletal muscle. In addition, we found that the overall editing rate exhibited a significant positive correlation with the level of ADAR1/2 expression during skeletal muscle development. These results suggest that A-to-I RNA editing mediated by ADAR1/2 is involved in myogenesis.We detected thousands of dDESs and noted that the editing levels of most dDESs were decreased during skeletal muscle development. Additionally, most dDESs were significantly correlated with host mRNA levels and functionally associated with muscle organ development. Moreover, we experimentally validated the effects of RNA editing on host gene expression in vitro. These experiments confirm the functionality of these editing sites in skeletal muscle development. Previous studies have suggested that RNA editing at 3'-UTRs is developmentally regulated58 and might disrupt miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing and gene expression.14,59 Remarkably, we noted that dDESs were considerably enriched at the 3'-UTR and confirmed that dDESs at the 3'-UTR might affect miRNA target binding. These results suggest that A-to-I editing may play a regulatory role during skeletal muscle development. Recent advances in RNA-editing research have led to the creation of several RNA editing resources for humans, mice, and flies.41,42,60,61 Although each of these resources provide valuable information, a database of RNA editing in the pig is currently lacking. Our present database provides information regarding the dynamic landscape of RNA editing during pig skeletal muscle development, which might be useful for researchers who study skeletal muscle development and animal breeders developing new molecular markers for meat production traits.In summary, we created a comprehensive and dynamic atlas of the S. scrofa RNA editome in skeletal muscle across 27 developmental stages. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide atlas of the RNA editome of developing animal skeletal muscle. This work identified a series of RNA editing sites associated with skeletal muscle development and revealed their potential roles in myogenesis. This study presents new insight into skeletal muscle development and provides abundant information regarding regulation of RNA editing. This knowledge may be helpful to animal breeders, as well as to biomedical researchers studying muscle-related diseases.Availability of dataSequencing data have been deposited to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under accession numbers SRP157242, SRP160645, SRP158448 and SRP159202.The authors thank Dr Zhongyin Zhou for discussion and critical review of the manuscript.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31830090), the National Key Project (2016ZX08009-003-006), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2015CB943100), the Shenzhen Science, Technology and Innovation Commission (JCYJ20170307160516413), and the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP-AGIS5).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionIn eukaryotes, the 35S nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) units are organized in tandem repeats located at one or more chromosomal loci, the so-called nucleolar organizing region (NOR).1 The rDNA unit is composed of the coding regions for the 18S, 5.8S and 26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA); the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2); and the intergenic spacer (IGS). The IGS, located between the 3’ end of the 26S rRNA gene and the 5’ end of the 18S rRNA gene, comprises the 3' external transcribed spacer (3'-ETS), the non-transcribed spacer, and the 5’-ETS). In general, the IGS is built of multiple blocks of tandem and dispersed repeats that may be arranged in highly complex patterns, resulting in variations between related species, populations and even within an individual.2 The presence of conserved structural features in the IGS, such as repeating elements, sequences with self-complementarity having the potential to generate a conserved secondary structure, the transcription initiation site (TIS) and the transcription termination site, all led to the recognition of the IGS as a functionally important region.1The presence of highly variable repeats in the IGS of most higher eukaryotes suggests that these fulfil an important function.1 Their function as possible enhancers of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription has been studied predominantly in interspecific hybrids.3 The rDNA loci with a longer IGS, containing more homologous repeats upstream of TIS, transcriptionally dominate over those with a shorter IGS in Triticum-Aegilops,4,Triticum-Secale5 and Tragopon mirus2 but not in Solanum,6,Brassica7 and Arabidopsis.8 Repeats from Arabidopsis thaliana can, however, substitute for Xenopus repeats to enhance Pol I transcription.9 Additionally, repeats within the 5'-ETS constitute a recognition site for DNA-interacting proteins, which may stimulate the transcription of rDNA.10 In Tragopogon,2,Solanum11 and Vigna radiate,1 transcriptionally dominant rDNA variants harbour more repeats in the 5'-ETS. Repeats localized upstream of the TIS may contain multiple termination signals for Pol I.12 In many species, individual rDNA repeats do not evolve independently but in a concerted manner due to the process of sequence homogenization, resulting in the co-existence of numerous nearly identical units in the same genome.13 However, accumulating data suggest that multiple rDNA repeat units with different sequence similarities and lengths, mainly due to variable repeats in IGS, can be simultaneously present in the same genome.2,14 The origin of such diversity has not been explained. Nevertheless, only a subset of rRNA genes with distinct structures is transcriptionally active, a phenomenon known as nucleolar dominance in hybrids.7 The interplay of DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodelling activities guided by ncRNA derived from variable IGSs is required for the specific establishment of chromatin organization in silent 35S rDNA in animals15 and plants.16Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita moschata, and Cucurbita maxima are the most economically important cultivated species within Cucurbita with relatively small genome sizes 0.55, 0.43 and 0.46 pg/1C, respectively (Kew Angiosperm DNA C-values database). Isozyme assays and high (relative to other Cucurbitaceae) chromosome numbers (n = 20–24) have led to the suggestion that the genus is of allopolyploid origin.17 In C. moschata (2n = 40), the 45S rDNA occupies large parts of five chromosome pairs.17 However, sequencing data for IGS are currently not available for this species, and only a single IGS has been completely sequenced in each related species C. pepo and C. maxima, showing that duplicated promoter-like sequences with TIS for Pol I are separated by multiple tandem repeats,18 some of which may function in enhancing transcription, as shown for the related species Cucumis sativus.10 In C. pepo, restriction polymorphism showed that 3,400 rDNA units fall into seven classes that are distinct in length and/or nucleotide sequence.19 Therefore, nothing is currently known about either the structure of IGS in C. moschata or the distribution of 35S rDNA loci in C. pepo and C. maxima chromosomal complements.To elucidate the regulation of the cellular rRNA level, we initiated a study of plant IGSs, particularly the regions of initiation and termination of transcription. To estimate the intragenomic structural variability of the IGS, we leveraged the advantage of long reads provided by PacBio sequencing methodology, which is relatively insensitive to highly structured, GC-rich and repetitive, DNA, characteristic of IGS. As a model plant, we selected C. moschata, a species with rDNA units distributed among multiple rDNA loci, suggesting high structural variability. We focussed on two extremely GC-rich repetitive regions located upstream of genic and spacer promoter-like sequences and evaluated their heterogeneity in the content and the distribution of sequence motifs with the potential to adopt non-canonical DNA structures, which are believed to participate in transcription regulation. We further evaluated the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and length polymorphisms caused by short insertions, deletions or variable numbers of subrepeats along the entire rDNA unit, with a focus on comparing genic regions with an IGS and ITS.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material, DNA extraction, and Southern and slot blot hybridizationsMusquee de Provence (Muscat de Provence) cultivar of C. moschata Duch. ex Poir. and Rouge vif d’Etampes cultivar of C. pepo L. were grown in a garden. Fresh young leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder, which was mixed with 2.5 volumes (v/w) of extraction buffer [1.1 M NaCl, 1.4% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 71 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 14 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol] and incubated for 60 min at 60°C with occasional gentle mixing. The extract was gently mixed with an equal volume of chloroform:octanol (24:1). After centrifugation [13,000 × g, 20 min, room temperature (RT)], the DNA was precipitated with 2/3 volume of isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol/10 mM NH4OAc several times for 6 h, dissolved in TE, treated with RNase A (100 µg.ml-1, SIGMA) for 60 min at 37°C and protease K (200 µg. ml-1, SIGMA) for 20 h at 52°C, extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The quantity and quality of DNA were checked by spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis. For Southern analysis, genomic DNA (2 µg) was digested with restriction endonucleases (10 U; 2 × 4 h), separated by gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nylon membranes (GE Healthcare). The hybridization was carried out in modified Church–Gilbert buffer.20 The 26S rDNA probe was a 220-bp PCR product derived from the 3' end of the 26S rRNA gene.21 This PCR product was also used as a standard for slot blot analysis. The IGS rDNA probes, covering the putative spacer promoter and R2 region, represent the PCR product amplified from GenBank accession MG744572 (cl7) by primers CF and CR (see PCR amplifications) and digested with NdeI. The hybridization signals were visualized by PhosphorImaging (Typhon; GE Healthcare) and quantitatively analysed by ImageQuant (GE Healthcare).2.2. Fractionalization of genomic DNA and PacBio sequencingTo enhance the content of rDNA in the sample, the rDNA was separated from appropriately restricted bulk genomic DNA by preparative electrophoresis. One milligram of DNA was digested with EcoRV (3 × 8 h; 3 × 1,000 U), and the completeness of digestion was checked by Southern blot hybridization against 26S rDNA (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The digested DNA (300 µg) was size-fractionated by electrophoresis in a 0.5% preparative agarose gel using Bio-Rad Model 491 Prep-Cell (Serva). When the xylene cyanol dye marker reached the bottom of the gel, individual fractions (1.3 ml/4 min) were collected under electrophoretic conditions of 70 V/5.5 h (fractions 1–83), followed by 100 V (fractions 84–174). Each fraction was lyophilized and dissolved in 100 µl TE + 1 mM DTT, and 2-µl aliquots were analysed by Southern hybridization to the 26S rDNA probe. The fractions with the highest ratio between the hybridization signal and total input DNA (Supplementary Fig. S1B; framed) were collected, desalted with NucAwayTM Spin Columns (Ambion), lyophilized and checked for DNA quantity and quality (Supplementary Fig. S1C).The PacBio RS library insert length was 2.1 kb on average (Supplementary Fig. S2A). During sequencing, the library inserts were passed by the polymerase ~12 times on average (Supplementary Fig. S2B), thus creating a mean read quality of the insert sequences of 99.61% (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Using CLC bio (http://cgs.hku.hk/portal/index.php/software-for-next-generation-sequencing), reads of inserts (ROIs) were mapped to a reference sequence assembled from GenBank accessions for the C. pepo 26S rRNA gene (AF479108.1), IGS (X55960.1), 18S rRNA gene (AF206895.1) and ITS1-5.8S_rDNA_gene–ITS2 region (consensus sequence derived from AM981169.1; AM981168.1; AJ488214.1; KF835490.1; FJ915107.2; FJ915103.2; FJ915102.2 and EF595858.1) (Supplementary Fig. S3). The reference sequence was terminally delimited by a unique EcoRV restriction site located within the 5.8S rRNA gene. The mean insert length of the mapped ROIs was ~2.1 kb (Supplementary Fig. S2D). More than 100 ROIs, covering predominantly repetitive regions in the IGS, were difficult to map and were assigned manually based on dot-plot figures specific for pumpkin IGS. We therefore extracted the consensus sequence derived from all successfully mapped ROIs, and all available ROIs were again mapped to this consensus. When compared with the initial mapping, additional ROIs were mapped, particularly those homologous to IGS repeat. After the second mapping, we extracted the resulting consensus sequence (Supplementary Fig. S4) and evaluated the frequency and distributions of abundant (>10%) SNPs.The read quality of each ROI, harbouring the R2 repeat, was estimated from the number of subreads. Only those subreads spanning the entire R2 region were considered for calculations (Supplementary Fig. S2E). To evaluate the capacity of the PacBio to determine the correct length of GC-rich and highly repeated regions, the lengths of the longest R1 and R2 consensus sequences, determined by dot-plot analyses, were compared with the lengths in each corresponding subread (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B).2.3. Sequence analysisThe copy numbers and lengths of monomeric units as well as the overall lengths of repetitive regions were determined by the Tandem Repeats Finder22 (https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html). The lengths of repetitive regions were also estimated from (i) the length of the DNA with an uninterrupted GC content higher than 75% determined by the bend.it® server (http://pongor.itk.ppke.hu/dna/bend_it.html#/bendit_intro) (window size 31) and (ii) dot plot diagrams constructed by the YASS: genomic similarity search tool (http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/yass/yass.php). This approach was also used to determine duplicated promoter-like regions delimited by the conserved boundary sequences CCATCACCCATT and TGGGCATATGCTTGG. The size variability at repetitive regions was also evaluated from distances between the conserved boundary unique sequences GGAGGYTAACC and TACCAACA for R1 or TGGGCATATGCTTGG and CCATCACCCATT for R2. The variability in the distances between duplicated TIS sequences ATATAGGGGG was estimated as well.The potential to form G-quadruplexes (pG4) was evaluated with QGRS Mapper23 (http://bioinformatics.ramapo.edu/QGRS/analyze.php). Because the sequence propensity for forming Z-DNA was on the order of d(GC)n > d(CA)n > d(CGGG)n > d(AT)n,24 we separately evaluated the frequency and distribution of (CG)n repeats longer than 7 nt, more complex (PuPy)n, or CG3 motifs. The frequency and distribution of short dispersed repeated motifs were evaluated manually.Phylogenetic relationships were constructed from the SNP distribution among the promoter-like sequence variants linked to the R1 and/or R2 regions in the corresponding ROIs. The sequences of genic and spacer promoters were aligned altogether using the MUSCLE programme, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the MEGA 7 programme. The evolutionary history was inferred using a maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model.25 The confidence of inferred evolutionary relationships was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 500 repetitions.For comparative statistics, the Mann-Whitney (http://vassarstats.net/utest.html) non-parametric U-test and Student’s parametric t-test (Microsoft Excel) were used.2.4. Fluorescence in situ hybridizationChromosomes from squash root tips were prepared according to previous methods,26 except for enzymatic treatment, which lasted 30–45 min. Squashes were treated with RNase A (100 µg/ml) in a humidified chamber (37°C/1 h), rinsed in 2× standard saline citrate (SSC) at RT for 3 × 5 min, treated with pepsin (50 µg/ml) at RT for 5–7 min, rinsed in 2× SSC (3 × 5 min), fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, rinsed in 2× SSC (3 × 5 min), dehydrated in an ethanol series (50, 70 and 100%) for 2 min each, and air-dried. The 18S probe (GenBank X51576.1) was labelled with SpectrumGreen dUTP using a Nick Translation Kit (Abbott Molecular, IL, USA). The 5S probe (GenBank JX101915.1) was labelled with Amersham FluoroLinkTM Cy3-dUTP (GE Healthcare, Chalfont, St Giles, England) using the Nick Translation Mix from Roche. The hybridization mix (40% formamide, 50% dextran sulphate, 2× SSC and 100–150 ng of each probe in a 30 µl volume) was heated (10 min/75°C), cooled on ice, pipetted onto a slide and covered with a plastic coverslip. The slide was incubated in a humidified chamber (75°C/5 min, 65°C/2 min, 55°C/2 min, 45°C/2 min and 37°C/17 h) and washed in 2× SSC (42°C/2 × 5 min), 0.1× SSC (42°C/2 × 5 min), 2× SSC (42°C/2 × 5 min), 2× SSC (RT/5 min) and 4× SSC/0.1% Tween 20 (RT/7 min) with a final brief wash in PBS. The chromosomes were counterstained in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) containing 1.5 µg/ml 4’, 6-diamidino-2’-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence images were captured using an Olympus AX 70 fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera. Images were analysed and processed using ISIS software (MetaSystems, Altlussheim, Germany).2.5. PCR amplifications, cloning and sequencingFor PCR amplification of R2 repetitive regions, primers CF (5'-ACTTGAAAGAATGACGCCGGT-3') and CR (5'-CAAGAAAACAACAACTCCACATGTAA-3') (Supplementary Fig. S4) were designed. The PCR mixture was composed of 0.4 µM each primer, 0.5 ng/µl of template genomic DNA, 0.2 mM of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 1× KAPA Taq Buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2), 5% DMSO and 0.02 U/µl KAPA Taq DNA Polymerase (KAPABIOSYSTEMS). The cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (95°C/180 s), followed by 35 cycles (95°C/30 s, 57°C/30 s, 72°C/60 s) and then 72°C/5 min. The PCR products were checked by agarose-gel electrophoresis, ligated into the pDrive Cloning Vector (QIAGEN) and sequenced by Sanger methodology.2.6. Data availabilityThe PacBio FASTQ data generated from this study were submitted to NCBI under the BioProject ID PRJNA400686 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/400686). The data derived from Sanger sequencing have been submitted to GenBank under accessions MG744571-MG744575.3. Results3.1. Considerably high numbers of rDNA units distributed across multiple chromosomal loci suggest the coexistence of rDNA structural variants in the pumpkin genomeDigestion of C. moschata genomic DNA with EcoRV resulted in almost completely restricted rDNA into a population of ~10 kb long units that migrated during electrophoresis as a prominent band detected either by staining with ethidium bromide or by hybridization with rDNA probe (Supplementary Fig. S1A), suggesting considerably high rDNA copy numbers in the genome. For a detailed evaluation of rDNA intragenomic heterogeneity, the DNA-species forming this band were subjected to PacBio sequencing. Approximately one quarter (4,200) of the ROIs were successfully mapped to a 35S rDNA reference sequence, indicating ~3-fold enhancement of the rDNA content in the sample in comparison to the native pumpkin genomic DNA, in which a fraction of ~7.8% (6,500 copies) was estimated to be composed of 35S rDNA (Supplementary Table S1) distributed across five chromosomal loci of highly variable sizes as follows from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses performed previously by Waminal et al.17 (2011). To evaluate the variability in the chromosomal distribution of 35S rDNA within Cucurbita, we performed a similar analysis with C. pepo. As in C. moschata, hybridization signals at two loci (four signals) were significantly stronger than the remaining signals (Fig. 1A) frequently present on extremely small chromosomes (Fig. 1E). Although the number of strong 35S rDNA signals was invariant, the total number of signals slightly varied (12–13) among ten here analysed metaphases, suggesting potential aneuploidy in C. pepo, which was supported by some metaphase preparations with counted 41 chromosomes (Fig. 1F). In addition, higher total number of 35S rDNA sites in C. pepo, than in C. moschata suggests some instability of 35S rDNA across Cucurbita. Similarly, two loci and one locus of the 5S rDNA detected in C. moschata17 and C. pepo (Fig. 1B), respectively, suggests that instability in rDNA is rather common in Cucurbita. Nevertheless, the distribution of 35S rDNA across multiple loci in both species might indicate the coexistence of 35S rDNA structural variants within Cucurbita. FISH at metaphase chromosomes of C. pepo. Four very strong and nine significantly weaker signals for 35S rDNA (green; panels A and D) complemented with two strong signals for 5S rDNA (red; panels B and D) were detected. Chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI (C). To count all very small chromosomes hardly detected with colour, chromosomes were highlighted in inverted black and white format (panels E and F). Two metaphase preparations are shown, and panel E corresponds to panels (A–D). The chromosomes that harbour 35S rDNA are marked by arrowheads. Panel (F) shows metaphase preparation with all chromosomes well separated, counted and numbered from 1 through 41, approximately in the order of their relative sizes. Note that odd total number of chromosomes suggests an aneuploidy in this metaphase, which is in agreement with the odd number of rDNA signals shown in panels (A, D and E), although showing different metaphase. Scale bars (A–F) = 10 µm. FISH at metaphase chromosomes of C. pepo.

Scale bars (A–F) = 10 µm. It is necessary to stress that such a mode of rDNA sample purification, based on a specific restriction pattern, may eliminate 35S rDNA pseudogenes or unusual IGS variants that are sometimes found dispersed in genomes outside regular NORs.27 In theory, such a method is suitable for the enrichment of samples with each type of repeat, which might be restricted from the genome using an appropriate restriction endonuclease.Although relatively low numbers of 35S rDNA PacBio ROIs were analysed compared with the high copy numbers of 35S rDNA in the pumpkin genome, we believe that even those ROIs associated with the region of lowest coverage (repeats in IGS) might depict the variability in prominent structural motifs with sufficient accuracy.3.2. Common sequence blocks in the IGS are shared in considerably variable proportions among individual rDNA copiesAs the IGS represents the region with the highest sequence heterogeneity within the pumpkin rDNA unit (Fig. 2B), we concentrated our further efforts to estimate the intra-individual structural variability of this evolutionarily highly variable region. Each IGS copy is assembled from the three repeat regions R1–R3, which are separated by two copies of a unique duplicated sequence (Pg and Ps) (Fig. 2A). These duplicates are mutually highly related (Fig. 2A; dot plot) and internally moderately variable nucleotide sequences (Supplementary Fig. S6) with sizes ranging from 442 to 459 bp. Both contain a highly conserved sequence motif (TATATAGGGG) related to the known plant TIS for Pol l, suggesting that they may function as putative genic (Pg) and spacer (Ps) Pol I promoters. Interestingly, both duplicates harbour another short, highly conserved motif, CCCCTATAT, which is located ~40 bp downstream of each (genic and spacer) TIS and represents nearly perfect reverse-complemented reflection of the TIS. Repetitive organization of the IGS in the pumpkin 35S rDNA unit. (A) Three regions (R1–R3), each built of tandemly arranged repetitive units, are separated by two mutually highly homologous sequences (Ps and Pg), as demonstrated by the dot-plot diagram constructed from the consensus sequence derived from mapped ROIs. Motifs related to TISs are denoted by arrows. (B) The frequency of abundant (>10%) SNPs plotted along the rDNA unit (100-bp window) shows that the R1 and R2 regions represent the most variable extremes in the rDNA unit. In contrast, all three genes are highly conserved and separated by the moderately variable ITS1 and ITS2. The pattern of all abundant SNPs along the source consensus sequence is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. It is necessary to stress that the highest variability at repeats R1 and R2 may be artificially overestimated owing to possible incorrect mapping of the corresponding ROIs with variable copy numbers of repeats.Repetitive organization of the IGS in the pumpkin 35S rDNA unit.

Analyses of 134 and 436 ROIs by several independent methods consistently demonstrated extraordinarily high size variability at R1 (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B) and R2 (Fig. 3) tandem repeats, respectively, which ranges with fine graduations of more than hundreds of bp and a multimodal size distribution. Such a broad size variability at R1 and R2 even resulted in reciprocal lengths of both repeats in some IGSs, as demonstrated by ROIs bearing either more abundant R1 or more abundant R2 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The multimodal distribution of size variants in the R2 repeated region. Three independent methods were used to evaluate the size variability: (A) Distance between two boundary unique sequences (see Section 2.3). (B) Overall size of all tandem repeats detected in the R2 region by Tandem Repeats Finder. (C) Size of the uninterrupted region with GC content higher than 75%. Significant correlations between the results obtained using these three approaches, are demonstrated in panels (D–F).The multimodal distribution of size variants in the R2 repeated region.

The exception was a single R3 region composed of 4.3 repeats.Size polymorphisms detected by PacBio sequencing in the R1 and R2 regions were verified in the genome-wide range by PCR and Southern blot analyses. PCR amplification of R2 regions provided multiple products with an overall shape characteristic of tandem repeats (Supplementary Fig. S9). They all were, however, shorter than expected and the origins of the PCR products were, therefore, verified by Sanger sequencing. All cloned PCR products were assembled of the spacer promoter and short repeats of different sizes related to the R2 region.To evaluate the size variability at repeated regions by Southern blot analyses, genomic DNA was digested by restriction enzymes with targets in the vicinity of those repeats, and restriction fragments of interest were visualized by hybridization to the IGS probe(s) (Fig. 4A). Restriction with NdeI or DraI was used for R2 repeats, whereas double digestion with NdeI and HpaI showed overall size heterogeneity in both R1 and R2 regions. Each digest provided multiple rather diffuse hybridization signals (Fig. 4B), indicating the number of size variants present in both R1 and R2 regions and continuously spanning a considerably wide range of size distributions. Such pattern correlated well with the multimodal size distribution of PacBio ROIs (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). Evident structural variability across plants within single cultivar (Fig. 4D), suggests fast repeats spreading or contraction in pumpkin IGS. As expected from the restriction map (Fig. 4A), both NdeI and DraI digests also provided long (>5 kb) hybridization signals (Supplementary Fig. S10). The NdeI fragment (7617 bp) harbours the entire R1, whereas the DraI fragment (5,360 bp) contains the entire R3 repeat. More diffuse pattern provided by NdeI confirmed higher size variability in the R1 region than in the R3 region. Size polymorphisms at R2(R1) region(s) may be supported on a genome-wide range by Southern blot analyses.

Structurally divergent DNA minisatellites coexist in the R2 regionMultimodal distribution of size variants in both the R1 and R2 regions, which were consistently detected by PacBio sequencing and Southern analyses, suggested the coexistence of two or more prominent lengths and/or structural variants in both regions. We further focussed on detailed structural analyses of the R2 repeat because it is adjacent to both promoter-like regions (Fig. 2A), and the multimodal distribution of size variants appeared to be more pronounced compared with the R1 and R3 regions. Each R2-repeat variant was significantly enriched in GC content (Supplementary Fig. S8), and the sense DNA strand was enriched with C at the expense of G (C:G ~ 7:3). We therefore inspected individual ROIs for the frequency and distribution of sequence motifs associated with GC-rich and inter-strand C/G bias as follows: (i) pG4- and pZ-motifs with the potential to form non-canonical G-quadruplexes and left-handed Z-DNA structures, respectively; (ii) tandemly arrayed partially degenerated short DNA motifs forming microsatellite-like DNA stretches; and (iii) the dispersed highly abundant permutated motifs C3G and GC3. Based on the highly variable number and spatial arrangement of these motifs, all R2 repeats might be classified into five structural families, A–E (Fig. 5A), arranged according to their abundance (Fig. 5B). They all are formed of relatively short (34–79 bp) tandemly arrayed units, each consisting of equal numbers of pZ- and pG4-motif(s) (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, each repeat unit has a polarised structure with pZ characteristics prevailing towards the spacer promoter, while pG4 structural characteristics are more prominent towards the genic promoter. Intrinsic structures of both pZ- (Supplementary Table S3) and pG4- (Supplementary Table S4) motifs were, however, specific for a particular family. An enormous structural variability in the R2 region was further emphasized by multiple subfamilies with a distinct number of tandemly arranged repetitive units and overall length, which might be defined within the majority of families (Fig. 5). Selected structural features that further discriminated individual families are summarized in Table 1.Five prominent repeated families coexist in R2 regions in pumpkin IGSs. (A) Each family (A–E) is characterized by a specific arrangement of two kinds of short sequence motifs, pZ and pG4. Individual abundant pZ- and pG4-variants are distinguished by small and numbered capital letters, respectively, within corresponding rectangles and specified in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively. C3/C4 means that two pG4-motifs (C3 and C4) are overlapping. Three pG4 prominent variants that are distinct in length of G tracts (G2–G4) are considered. A particular family may consist of several size variants (subfamilies) with a distinct number of basic tandem repeats (arrows). Each subfamily is represented by the most abundant distribution of pG4-motifs. (B) The relative abundance of individual subfamilies (left) and families (right) in the genome is estimated from the number of corresponding ROIs.Five prominent repeated families coexist in R2 regions in pumpkin IGSs.

Both motifs, however, significantly differ between families in structure. In Family A, the majority of pG4-motifs are formed of short G2 tracts, resulting in the shortest monomeric unit. In contrast, G3 and G4 tracts are characteristic for Family C, resulting in a substantially longer unit with higher potential to form G4-conformations. Nevertheless, in both families, pG4 variants with greater potential to form G4 conformations are accumulated towards the genic promoter. In Family A, the number of such pG4 variants appears to be independent of the considerably variable total number of pZ- and pG4-motifs in individual size subfamilies. Such an arrangement may result in a polarized structure of the R2 region as a whole. It is necessary to stress that the pG4 variant U1 with the highest potential to form G-quadruplexes is significantly more abundant in Family C in comparison to other families (Supplementary Table S4).Family B is exceptional in carrying the longest basic monomeric repeated units, each built of alternating arrangements of two pZ- and two pG4-variants. Such an arrangement results in partial homology within each unit. Although both abundant subfamilies B8 and B8a share the same number of pZ-motifs, they differ substantially in the occurrence of specific pG4-motifs (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S4) and relative content of GC3 and C3G motifs (Table 1).Family D is the shortest and the most homogeneous in size, built of a unique copy number of basic monomeric units, each composed of single pZ- and single pG4-motifs, both with specific structural features (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).In size, the moderately variable Family E is built of monomers that are closely related to those found in Family C; however, they are, on average, shorter due to the absence of pG4 motifs with G4 tracts that are frequent in Family C. In addition, two highly conserved pZ-variants (Supplementary Table S3) as well as four pG4-variants (Supplementary Table S4) are specific for this family.Considerably high structural variability occurred within almost each pG4 position along each subfamily (Fig. 6). In contrast, variability in adjacent pZ motifs appeared rather negligible, suggesting a diverse mode of evolution. Substantial variability within each family was further demonstrated using comprehensive descriptive statistics performed for the number of quantitative features within each corresponding subfamily (Supplementary Table S5). Finally, significant differences among all five R2 families were supported by comparative statistics in all evaluated structural characteristics with only a few exceptions (Supplementary Table S6).

The pG4-variants are distinguished by numerals representing the in silico computed potential (score) to form a G4-conformation. Each pG4-variant may, however, be composed of several sequence motifs with the same score.

Correlation between the structural variability in R2 repeats and adjacent regions of pumpkin IGSsSuggesting the concerted evolution of IGSs as a unit, we questioned whether the structural variability at the R2 region was reflected in the distal R1 region with comparable multimodal length variability (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). Both regions are GC rich and share some motifs, particularly C4GC, in similar abundances, suggesting a common origin. Nevertheless, a rather low overall sequence similarity between regions was detected by dot plot analyses (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S8A) and further supported by the occurrence of predominantly different short GC-rich motifs in both regions. (i) The pZ-motifs prevail in R2 as (CG)n variants (Fig. 5), whereas more complex (PyPu)n variants are common in R1, and therefore, except for the (CG)4C motif, there is no shared pZ-motif variant in either region (compare Supplementary Table S3 with Supplementary Table S7). (ii) No pG4-motif variant with G4 stretches is shared by the two regions (Supplementary Table S8). (iii) The ratio between G3C and C3G motifs is mostly reversed between R1 and R2 repeats.The mutual distribution of the pZ- and pG4-motifs along the entire R1 region and its overall length and size variability suggest that five basic structural variants, S, T, U, V and X (Supplementary Fig. S11), coexist in the R1 region. Families S, U and X are short with low size variability, whereas families T and V are highly variable in size but substantially different in the mutual distribution of pZ- and pG4-motifs. Family T is composed of a large number of pZ-motifs that are regularly distributed along the entire length and complemented with a few pG4-motifs adjacent to the spacer promoter. In contrast, Family V is full of pG4-motifs that are regularly arranged along the entire region and complemented with three pZ-motifs adjacent to the spacer promoter. Among the short R1 families, S is distinct, having a lower number of pZ-motifs in comparison to the pG4-motifs, whereas both the U and X families contain high accumulations of pZ-motifs, significantly exceeding the number of pG4-motifs. The U family has a lower number of pZ-motifs than the X family. Common, as well as specific pZ-motifs (Supplementary Table S7) are present in all R1 families.To evaluate whether distinct R1 families are specifically linked to corresponding R2 families, we analysed a limited number of ROIs composed of both R1 and R2 regions (or the larger part) linked to a spacer promoter. We showed that for each R1 family, all corresponding ROIs fall into a unique R2 family and vice versa (Supplementary Table S9). It is necessary to stress that the R2 satellite families A and C, which are rather long and variable in size, are linked to the short and size-invariant R1 families S and U, respectively. In contrast, the short and less variable in size R2 Families D and B are linked to the long and highly variable in size R1 families V and T, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 12).As both R1 and R2 repetitive regions show signs of common evolution, we extended our effort to evaluate structural variability at adjacent non-repetitive promoter regions. The phylogenetic analysis well separated the genic and spacer promoter duplicates. In addition, both genic and spacer promoters were split into five clusters 1g–5g and 1s–5s, respectively, supported by bootstrap values ranging from 52 to 96% (Fig. 7). All promoter sequences forming particular cluster were linked to a unique family from the R1 and R2 regions (Supplementary Table S10) and vice versa, suggesting a common evolution of repeated and unique sequences in pumpkin IGS. ML phylogenetic tree constructed from the SNP distribution along putative promoters. Genic and spacer promoter variants, determined in Supplementary Fig. S6, are well separated. In addition, both genic and spacer promoter sequences are split into the same number (five) of clusters of 1g–5g and 1s–5s, respectively. Owing to high number of sequences, individual clusters are represented by circles with areas proportional to the number (specified in brackets) of corresponding promoters, specified in more details in Supplementary Table S10. Only bootstrap values higher than 50% are shown.ML phylogenetic tree constructed from the SNP distribution along putative promoters.

Only bootstrap values higher than 50% are shown.Finally, the size ranges of RTAnT-motifs, located between the spacer promoter and R1 repeat (Supplementary Fig. S4) are highly specific for each corresponding spatially linked R1/R2 family (Table 1).Classification of the pumpkin IGSs into multiple families appears to be highly legitimate because structural variants of R1 (Supplementary Fig. S11) and R2 (Fig. 5) repeats, defined based on the arrangement of distinct structural blocks, correlate well with (i) adjacent promoter variants (Fig. 7; Supplementary Table S10) that are independently defined from the distribution of SNPs and (ii) the size of A/T-rich region RTAnT (Table 1).4. Discussion4.1. The minisatellite-like organization suggests genetic instability and accelerated structural evolution of R2 (R1) regions, which might affect transcription from adjacent Pol I promotersThe repeat unit size, copy number, sequence purity, and GC content of R2/R1 repeats in pumpkin IGSs are typical for so-called DNA minisatellites. The origin of the extended copy number variability at R2/R1 regions may, therefore, be explained by mechanisms that are common for satellites where the number of repeated units expands or contracts at high frequencies by mechanisms such as intra- and inter-locus recombination and/or replication slippage.28 In pumpkin IGSs, minisatellites that are highly variable in length (Families A and C) coexist with those with sizes that are rather stable (Family D), suggesting distinct mechanisms of evolution.The occurrence of tandem repeats in the vicinity of Pol I promoters appears to be a common feature of IGSs across flowering plants (Supplementary Table S11). Their structures (size of monomeric unit, copy number, nucleotide sequence and GC content) vary; however, with wide ranges even between closely related species. Nevertheless, significantly higher GC content, compared with adjacent promoter-like sequences, appeared to be the most striking feature of IGS satellites and the highest GC content within plants is characteristic for Cucurbita. Microsatellites (the most striking example represents Capsicum), minisatellites (Olea) and satellites (Hordeum) have evolved upstream of TIS, whereas only minisatellites (Eruca) and satellites (Cucurbita) were found downstream of TIS. The distance between TIS and adjacent satellites varies widely, and the corresponding nucleotide sequence is extremely variable even in the short ‘core’ Pol I region adjacent to TIS.The instability of satellites with mutation frequencies from 10-2 to 10-5 per generation is within the range of frequencies of genetic point mutations (10-8 to 10-9) and epigenetic switches (10-1 to 10-2).29 Therefore, these repetitive elements share both genetic and epigenetic features. As tandem repeats can reversibly expand or contract without a complete loss of information, they resemble epigenetic transitions, which do not lead to severe changes in function or completely novel features. Generally, tandem repeats are frequently located in gene promoters where their variations can act as mediators of rapid and fine-tuned phenotypic changes, perhaps through alterations in chromatin structure.29,30 The activation of Pol I transcription appears to be mediated by transcription factors that interact with both the promoter and the upstream located mini(satellites) (enhancers), although their structural features vary with a wide range between maize,31,Xenopus32 and mice33 (Supplementary Table S11). In pumpkin, R2 minisatellites are built of rather atypical repeat units, each composed of two kinds of asymmetrically distributed GC-rich and short microsatellite-like sequences with the potential, although considerably variable, to form Z- or G4-non-canonical DNA structures. There are direct and indirect pieces of evidence that both G4- and Z-DNA conformations are formed in vivo: (i) functionally important genomic regions, including promoters, rDNA and sites with low nucleosome occupancy are enriched in these motifs.34,35 (ii) Specific proteins with affinity to pZ- or pG4- or both-conformations participate in their regulation either by promotion or destabilization.36 Namely, two abundant nucleolus-specific proteins, nucleolin and nucleophosmin, show specific affinity to G4-conformations in rDNA.37 Related proteins might recognize the satellites in pumpkin IGSs that are rich in both motifs, although their distributions and proportions vary widely. During transcription, these proteins may interact with G4 structures formed by the non-template G-rich strand to prevent renaturation of the duplex and to render the template strand available for multiple rounds of transcription. The stability of the melted region may correlate with variable numbers or densities of pG4-motifs. (iii) Hoogsteen base pairs may transiently form in canonical double-stranded DNA,38 and G4 conformations can be formed in supercoiled duplex DNA and DNA in chromatin in vivo.39 As local disruption of the regular double helix DNA structure is associated with B-Z transition,40 G4-formation may be promoted by closely linked pZ-motifs. Diversely methylated pZ-motifs may undergo a B-Z transition with varying efficiency,41 and thereby increase the epigenetically determined structural heterogeneity of distinct IGS variants.The occurrence of two significantly larger FISH signals in both C. moschata and C. pepo may suggest that these loci are transcriptionally active and form dominant NORs. However, FISH analyses did not show any secondary constriction at these loci in either C. moschata17 or C. pepo (Fig. 1). We previously showed that there is no unequivocal correlation between the size of rDNA loci and their transcription activity, and even loci with highly reduced rDNA copy numbers may be transcriptionally dominant, forming active NORs.42Specific structural features of the short repeat unit together with its variable copy numbers may result in decreased sequence complexity along considerably long and variable DNA stretches associated with altered GC content, bendability, intrinsic curvature and, consequently, chromatin structure.43 Altered chromatin structure established at such repeats may consequently partially spread into adjacent regulatory elements and gradually sterically attract/repulse certain factors that participate in transcription or replication.4.2. Origin and spatial arrangement of multiple 35S rDNA variants in the pumpkin genomeGenerally, tandem repeats in individual IGS variants may differ: (i) in the copy number of the common repeat, as observed between species within Capsicum, Solanum and Quercus (Supplementary Table S11). (ii) In the spatial arrangement of common repeats, as found between Tragopogon dubius and Tragopogon porrifolius,2 and (iii) in the occurrence of specific repeats, as has been described for Brassica species.7 Owing to a few IGSs analysed in each species, interspecies heterogeneity detected among highly related species may; however, be the consequence of broad size variability within each species, as documented recently for Arabidopsis14 and here for pumpkin. We describe the coexistence of a number of IGS variants in a single genome, which differ not merely in overall length defined by the number of tandem repeats but also in their intrinsic structure determined by the specific arrangement of distinct short sequence motifs. Such enormous rDNA variability supports the hypothesis of a hybrid/polyploid origin of C. moschata.17 Alternatively, multiple rDNA loci may originate from rDNA translocations in a single genome, and the structural identity of rDNA loci may be maintained as a consequence of inefficient interlocus homogenization. On the whole-genome scale, the mutual arrangement of individual rDNA variants in C. moschata is currently unknown. Considering the equal number (5) of rDNA structural variants (Fig. 5) and number of chromosomal rDNA loci,17 we can suppose that individual variants are distributed separately among multiple chromosomal loci. However, possible homeologous recombinations may lead to homogenization of rDNA at some or all loci during C. moschata diploidization. As a result, individual rDNA families might be partially or completely spatially intermingled. Despite invariable chromosome number in allohexaploid wheat (2n = 6x = 42), the numbers of rDNA chromosomal sites range from 2 to 16 (Plant rDNA database),44 suggesting variable modes of rDNA evolution during diploidization of wheat cultivars. In the recently formed allotetraploid T. mirus, both parental IGS variants have remained preserved.2 Among more ancient Nicotiana allotetraploids, the extent of interlocus rDNA homogenization decreased in the direction N. arentsii > N. tabacum > N. rustica45 and both parental variants remained in N. rustica, whereas complete homogenization of rDNA towards one parental variant occurred in N. arentsii. Using specific FISH probes derived from the parental IGS, both homogenization and preservation of parental rDNA variants were demonstrated in different cultivars of Brassica napus.46 Because of the extraordinarily high GC content of all R2 and R1 variants in pumpkin, they can hardly be distinguished by a similar approach. A significantly higher number of 35S rDNA than 5S rDNA suggests segmental duplications or 35S rDNA translocations during the pumpkin genome evolution. Alternatively, 5S rDNA has partially been eliminated, as may be inferred from only one 5S rDNA locus currently present in C. pepo.4.3. The global repetitive architecture of C. moschata IGSs is conserved among thousands of rDNA copies but differs in closely related speciesDespite the considerably high structural variability within both R1 and R2 minisatellites, the overall repetitive organization of pumpkin IGSs is rather conserved, invariably formed of three prominent repeats intermingled with two highly homologous copies of considerably long non-repetitive sequences, suggesting selection constraints to maintain such complexly structured regions. Although rarely occurring within flowering plants (Supplementary Table S11), similar duplications of promoter-like sequences separated by tandem repeats were previously described in distantly related species Tragopogon (Asteraceae),2,Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae),14,Quercus (Fagaceae),47,Daucus (Apiaceae)48 and Xanthisma (Asteraceae), suggesting recurrent duplication events during dicot evolution. Comprehensive analysis of the structural heterogeneity of the 35S rDNA IGS has, however, been performed only for A. thaliana using PacBio sequencing of PCR amplicons.14 As in pumpkin, high size heterogeneity is due to the variable number of short tandemly arrayed monomeric units, which, however, are significantly more homogeneous in nucleotide sequences compared with repeated units forming five families in pumpkin. In contrast to pumpkin, they are distributed among variable numbers (1–3) of tandem blocks separated by variable numbers of promoter-like duplicates (0–2). Intraspecific variability in the number of promoter-like sequences was also detected in Quercus robur. The number of duplicated promoter-like sequences significantly differs between the related species T. porrifolius (>3 copies) and T. dubius (2 copies). The length of duplicated regions significantly varies between species, ranging from less than 100 bp (probably representing only a core promoter) to several hundred bp.We presume that together with the non-repetitive sequence surrounding TIS, adjacent tandem repeats were also duplicated, as a whole or in part, during the evolution of the IGS. Alternatively, a unique promoter-like sequence may have been duplicated and translocated inside the ancestral unique tandem repeat. Perhaps due to the action of selective constraints, duplicated unique sequences evolved in a concerted manner to maintain a high degree of homology, both within and between them, in each species. In contrast, duplicated repeated regions could subsequently evolve rather independently either due to the absence of selective constraints or, more likely, their repetitive characteristics, which may have significantly accelerated their diversification. In pumpkin, both modern repetitive regions R1 and R2 share only a few signs: the extremely high GC content and the occurrence of short sequence motifs, including pZ and pG4, which may indicate their common origin. Duplicated satellites in each Q. robur, T. porrifolius and A. thaliana; however, share highly related nucleotide sequences, suggesting a more recent duplication or another mechanism of evolution, such as the impact of selection constraints on each satellite.The R3 repeat is unrelated to R1 and R2 repeats, made up of significantly longer units with the expected GC content, which seems to be common among dicots where repeats located upstream of TIS are, on average, composed of higher copy numbers of shorter monomers with higher GC content than repeats localized downstream (Supplementary Table S11). In contrast, monocots harbour satellites composed of substantially long repeated units located both upstream and downstream of genic TIS. When compared with R1 and R2 minisatellites, the R3 satellite in C. moschata is significantly more homogeneous in size, composed almost exclusively of three monomeric units, reminiscent of results previously reported for A. thaliana,14 and suggesting rather common features among plants. Despite high size homogeneity within C. moschata, the R3 repeat was significantly amplified in C. maxima, currently forming a tandem of nine units.18 Such interspecific differences might be explained on the basis of the so-called ‘library hypothesis’.49 Accordingly, both size variants of R3 probably evolved in a common ancestor, although perhaps at low copy numbers, followed by subsequent spreading of a shorter variant in C. moschata and C. pepo,18 while the longer variant was amplified in C. maxima. In contrast, the R1 repeat is almost completely deleted in C. maxima, whereas it is preserved in C. pepo. Nevertheless, both highly conserved sequences surrounding the R1 region in C. pepo and C. moschata are completely retained in C. maxima, surrounding the short non-repetitive region with signs of R1 repeats (CG-rich, pZ- and pG4-motifs) (Supplementary Table S2). The pumpkin R1 repeat may, therefore, originated by amplification of the short unique sequence present in the common ancestor rather than by the above mentioned duplication event. Similarly, T. dubius harbours relatively long repeats located downstream of TIS complemented with only one repeat located upstream of TIS, whereas the T. porrifolius IGS is composed of short downstream repeats complemented with multiple satellites located upstream.25. ConclusionsWe showed that in the genome of C. moschata, five rDNA structural variants are distributed across five chromosomal loci. Structural variability between rDNA variants is determined by the variable repetitive arrangement of a few kinds of short GC-rich sequence blocks with the potential to form non-canonical DNA structures and together to form various minisatellites in the IGS. Because pZ- and pG4-conformations, as well as tandemly arranged repeats in IGSs, are known to participate in transcriptional regulation, we hypothesize that such higher order structural variability of IGS repeats may participate in a graduated affinity of TIFs for the adjacent Pol I promoters, potentially promoting the fine orchestration of rDNA transcription regulation in response to cell protein synthesis demand. We suppose that individual rDNA variants evolved in two or more parental genomes followed by hybridization or, alternatively, within a single genome at separated chromosomal rDNA loci as a consequence of inefficient inter-locus homogenization.We thank Radka Vozarova for FISH analyses and helpful comments on the article.Accession numbersBioProject ID PRJNA400686 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/400686); GenBank MG744571-MG744575.FundingThe research was funded by the Czech Science Foundation (P501/17/11642S).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe glaucophyte algae (Glaucophyta1) are a small group of unicellular and colonial taxa with four described genera and about 15 species (Fig. 1). These taxa represent one branch of the Archaeplastida [the others are the red (Rhodophyta) and green algae and plants (Viridiplantae)]2 whose common ancestor putatively captured and retained a cyanobacterial endosymbiont ca. 1.6 billion years ago through primary endosymbiosis.3–6 The green algae in this ‘supergroup’ gave rise to plants, and the plastids of red and green algae were spread via serial endosymbioses to a myriad of other important primary producers including diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, and euglenids.7 What makes glaucophytes of particular interest is that they uniquely retain a suite of plastid traits associated with the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont, such as peptidoglycan (PG) and phycobilisomes, and lack chlorophyll-b.8,9 This lineage also harbours the primordial, bacterial (putatively chlamydial) derived UhpC-type hexose-phosphate transporter to translocate fixed carbon from the plastid to the host cytosol. This system was replaced in the red and green lineages by a complex gene family derived from existing eukaryote nucleotide sugar transporters that diversified into plastid phosphate-translocators.10 In addition, the model glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa (Fig. 2) contains an apparently primitive RNA interference pathway.11 Hence glaucophytes provide valuable insights into the presumed putative ancestral state of the Archaeplastida host and its photosynthetic organelle. The phylogeny of Glaucophyta. This tree was built using a multigene dataset comprising plastid-encoded PsbA, PsaB, and 16S rRNA, mitochondrial COX1 and COB, and nuclear-encoded ITS regions and partial sequences of SSU and LSU rRNA (modified from Price et al.9).The phylogeny of Glaucophyta.

For instance, Glaucophyta was found to contain a sophisticated plastid protein import machinery (e.g. the protein translocation channel Toc75; Supplementary Fig. S1) and pathways for starch biosynthesis and fermentation that are shared with other Archaeplastida. These derived traits belied the presumed ‘living fossil’ moniker of this lineage.10 Although valuable for assessing the gene inventory, the initial assembly was fragmented due to the primary use of Illumina short-read sequencing technology that was unable to deal adequately with the high average genome GC-content (67.6%) and intron-rich genes. Here we report a significantly improved genome assembly of the same C. paradoxa strain derived from PacBio long-read sequencing, in concert with extensive Illumina data for sequence correction. RNA-Seq data derived from cultures that span the light–dark transition in C. paradoxa and recently available transcriptome data from three other glaucophytes provide novel information on genome content, allowing us to comprehensively assess the evolutionary trajectory of glaucophytes and to test Archaeplastida monophyly in an expanded multigene tree of life. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of C. paradoxa cell ultrastructure to assess existing hypotheses about the morphological evolution of this lineage. These wide-ranging results paint a fascinating picture of glaucophyte evolution and identify features that both unite and distinguish C. paradoxa from its Archaeplastida sisters.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingApproximately 100 ml of a log-phase cell culture pellet was ground in liquid nitrogen, re-suspended in 10 ml G2 lysis buffer (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), and incubated at 37°C for 2 h with gentle agitation. RNase A was added to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 37°C prior to addition of Proteinase K (Qiagen) to 0.8 mg/ml and incubation for 2 h at 50°C with gentle agitation. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000–15,000 g to remove insoluble debris, transferred to an equilibrated Qiagen Genomic-tip 20 column, and washed four times with 1 ml of QC buffer (Qiagen) via gravity. The DNA was eluted with 0.8 ml QF buffer (Qiagen) via gravity, precipitated with 0.7 volumes of RT isopropanol and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 g. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet was washed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, allowed to air-dry, and re-suspended in 50 µl of TE. The DNA was sent to the Max Planck Institute genome sequencing centre for library construction (Cologne, Germany) and six SMRT cells were sequenced on an RSII instrument using P6-C4 chemistry, producing over 7.46 Gb of long-read sequence data with an average insert size of ca. 15 kb. The raw reads were trimmed, self-corrected and assembled using the Canu pipeline v1.012 with the following parameters: genomeSize = 110m, minOverlapLength = 1,000, utgGraphErrorRate = 0.020, utgRepeatErrorRate = 0.020. Two successive rounds of genome polishing were performed with Quiver (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) and a final correction was performed by mapping the Illumina genomic DNA libraries to the assembly using the CLC Genomics Workbench (95% similarity over 95% of the read length) and calling bases on a majority-rule basis with areas of zero coverage filled from the PacBio reference. Based on a cursory BLASTx analysis against bacterial genomes available at NCBI, we removed 36 contigs representing partial bacterial contaminant fragments to arrive at a final assembly spanning 712 contigs and totalling 99.94 Mb with a contig N50 = 214 kb.2.2. Illumina RNA-SeqApproximately 50 ml of log-phase C. paradoxa culture was centrifuged for 2 min and the cell pellet was ground in liquid nitrogen prior to extraction using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 100 ng of total RNA was used to prepare an Illumina RNA-Seq library with the RNA Sample prep kit v2 (Illumina, Inc.) and sequenced on a MiSeq instrument in 2 ×250 bp paired-end mode using a 500-cycle MiSeq reagent kit V2 (Illumina, Inc.). These reads were quality and adapter trimmed using the CLC Genomics Workbench, assembled to transcripts using Trinity13 in both a de novo and genome-guided manner, and clustered at 95% sequence similarity using CD-HIT.14 Evidence of long overlapping ORFs on these transcripts was found by translating with EMBOSS.15 We produced over 43.6 million RNA-Seq reads totalling 10.9 Gb of data. These reads assembled into 238,820 EST contigs. An additional 51 million stranded RNA-Seq reads were generated using 1.3 µg of extracted RNA with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample prep kit and sequenced in 2×75 bp paired-end mode.2.3. Illumina genome dataApproximately 50 ml of log-phase C. paradoxa culture was centrifuged for 2 min and the cell pellet was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant DNA kit. Two aliquots of ca. ~200 ng of genomic DNA were each sheared using a Covaris ultrasonicator (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA) to 500 and 800 bp, respectively, and used to construct two individual sequencing libraries using the TruSeq Nano DNA Sample prep kit (Illumina, Inc.) that were then sequenced on a MiSeq instrument in 2×300 bp paired-end mode using a 600-cycle MiSeq reagent kit v3 (Illumina, Inc.). Two sequencing runs were performed: one with the 500 and 800 bp inserts multiplexed, and another with the 500 bp insert alone. In total we produced 109 million reads totalling 33.59 Gb of C. paradoxa genomic DNA. Reads were quality and adapter trimmed using the CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen).2.4. Analysis of repeat contentWe compared the repeat content of the C. paradoxa genome against those in red and green algal genomes. To minimize potential biases of misassembled repetitive regions, we focussed only on available genome assemblies that comprise highly contiguous sequences or at chromosomal resolution: three red algae (Cyanidioschyzon merolae16 [NCBI BioProject PRJNA10792], Gracilariopsis chorda17 [PRJNA361418], and Porphyra umbilicalis18 v1.5 [PRJNA234409]), and three green algae (the prasinophytes, Micromonas commoda19 RCC299 [PRJNA15676] and Ostreococcus lucimarinus20 CCE9901 [PRJNA13044], and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii21 v5.5 [PRJNA12260]). For each genome assembly, a de novo repeat library was first derived using RepeatModeler v1.0.11 (http://repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) at default setting. All repeats were then identified using RepeatMasker v4.0.6 (http://repeatmasker.org (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) based on evidence in the customized repeat library (i.e. the RepeatMasker database plus the de novo repeats identified above). The repeat landscape for each genome was generated using the utility script calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl from RepeatMasker.2.5. Gene predictionThe RNA-Seq reads were mapped to genome contigs using STAR22 and the resulting .bam file was used in the BRAKER1 pipeline23 to ultimately train Augustus24 in predicting genes across the C. paradoxa genome. Augustus predicted 25,831 genes encoded on the C. paradoxa contigs. Each translated protein sequence was used in a BLASTp query against the NCBI ‘nr’ database (E-val =1×10-5) to assign a provisional annotation.2.6. Single nucleotide polymorphism detectionThe 109 million genomic DNA reads were mapped to the PacBio scaffolds using the CLC Genomics Workbench (95% similarity fraction over 95% of read length) and SNPs were called using the CLC Genomics Workbench variant caller (non-specific matches ignored, min. coverage = 10x, min. count = 3, min. central quality = 20).2.7. Phylogenomics of individual predicted proteinsEach predicted C. paradoxa protein was used in a BLASTp query against an in-house database composed of NCBI RefSeq v. 73 proteins with the addition of available algal and protist genome and transcriptome data from dbEST, TBestDB, the JGI Genome Portal (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) and the Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP).25 This database was partitioned into four subsets based on taxonomic provenance: Bacteria, Opisthokonta, remaining non-bacterial or opisthokont taxa, and the MMETSP database. Each subset was searched against independently (BLASTp, E = 10-10) using the C. paradoxa proteins and the top 2,000 hits from each search were saved, combined, and sorted by bitscore. The sorted list was parsed such that a taxonomically broad selection of top hits was retained, and the associated proteins were aligned together with the query sequence using MAFFT v7.2.26 Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQTREE v1.3 (81) after automatic model selection with nodal support tested via 2,000 ultrafast phylogenetic bootstraps.272.8. Differential gene-expression analysisThree biological replicates of C. paradoxa cells grown in a 16: 8 L/D cycle were each harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction at the following 6 timepoints: 1 h after lights-on (ALO), 8 h ALO, 14 h ALO, 1 h after dark (AD), 5 h AD, 7 h AD. The TruSeq RNA sample prep kit (Illumina, Inc.) was used to prepare Illumina RNAseq libraries for each (18 total libraries) prior to sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq using 50 bp single-end sequencing reagents. Approximately 20–24 million reads were generated for each library that were then mapped to the genome contigs using STAR.22 The resulting .bam files were parsed to generate per-gene counts with HTSeq 0.9.128 that were combined in a matrix and read with the R Bioconductor DEseq2 package.29 Read counts were normalized, and any gene that: (i) exhibited a log2 fold change of (+/-) 1.5 or greater between the first time point (1ALO) and any other time point, and (ii) had a BLASTp hit to the NCBI nr database, was retained as differentially expressed (DE). A variance stabilizing transformation was applied, and the set of DE genes was then clustered using an agglomerative hierarchical method available via the ‘agnes’ function. The variance-stabilized data pertaining to cluster members were then plotted and inspected; clusters were manually split, joined and outlying members were removed.To determine whether any clusters exhibited patterns of functional enrichment, the C. paradoxa predicted proteome was annotated using Blast2GO,30 and member genes of each cluster were used in a Fisher’s exact test, as performed in Blast2GO, with the reference set consisting of all 12,652 genes with BLAST hits in the genome. Gene Ontologies with an uncorrected P-value of <0.05 were retained. In addition, genes were annotated via the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS, https://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/31 (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) and grouped according to KEGG pathway assignment. Plots were created to illustrate the overall transcriptional response of all members in each pathway; those with a clear up- or down-ward trend comprising the majority of assigned genes were retained for discussion. In all, we identified 4,297 differentially expressed genes in the C. paradoxa light/dark treatment. These genes clustered into 40 predominant expression patterns. The cell cycle genes were identified via BLASTp using curated homologues from other algae, and further qualified using the NCBI ‘nr’ databases.2.9. Eukaryote tree of lifeTo place C. paradoxa in a broader eukaryote tree of life and test Archaeplastida monophyly, we adapted and expanded the protocol of Price and Bhattacharya32 to derive de novo ortholog groups (OGs) and construct a 3,000 OG dataset from 115 publicly available eukaryote proteomes. Briefly, EST and/or predicted proteome data were retrieved for each species (see Supplementary Table S1) and OrthoFinder33 was used to construct ortholog groups (OGs) from the total data. We parsed each group (or putative gene family) and retained those that had low levels of paralogy (>80% of genes in the group were single-copy [i.e. one protein per taxon]) and contained =4 phyla and =10 species. Taxa with multi-copy representative proteins were removed from these groups, and the protein sequences corresponding to each individual group were aligned with MAFFT v. 7.3.26 These alignments were then used to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogeny using IQ-TREE34 via a partitioned analysis in which each OG alignment represented a single partition with unlinked models of evolution chosen by IQTREE. A consensus tree was generated from the combined bootstrap set, and node support was determined by 2,000 rapid (UFBoot) bootstraps.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome data and repeat contentWe sequenced six PacBio RSII SMRT cells of C. paradoxa genomic DNA, producing over 7.46 Gb of long-read sequence data (see Supplementary Methods). A BLASTx analysis of the PacBio assembly using the NCBI bacterial proteome database identified 36 contigs containing partial bacterial contaminant fragments. These were removed yielding the final assembly of 712 contigs totalling 99.94 Mb (N50 = 214 kb). Inspection of various k-mer spectra under the expectation of haploidy or diploidy (http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) using high-quality Illumina reads provided evidence that C. paradoxa is more likely to be a haploid than a highly homogenized diploid genome (Supplementary Fig. S2). In support of this hypothesis, a SNP analysis using the PacBio assembly and Illumina short-read data identified 27,675 variants with at least 10x coverage (using 95% sequence identity over 95% of the trimmed read length). Of these, only 5,016 (or 18%) occurred at a frequency between 30–70%, suggesting that the major class of SNPs, expected at 40–60% for a diploid, was not recovered. Applying an ab initio approach for gene prediction guided by transcriptome data, we predicted 25,831 protein-coding genes in the C. paradoxa genome (excluding bidirectional transcripts, see below). Genes were densely packed, spanning 60.3% of the genome with a mean intergenic distance of only 770 bp (likely an over-estimation given that we did not predict UTRs), often oriented end-to-end with many short introns (mean = 9.2 introns/gene; mean length = 86 bp). Such complex gene structures are problematic for HMM-based gene predictors therefore the models presented here will require additional manual curation. BUSCO35 was used to assess completeness of the predicted proteome and identified 282 of the 303 (93%; 90% complete, 3% fragmented) of the core proteins as being present in the eukaryote (odb9) dataset, suggesting that the assembly was nearly complete. This represents a major improvement over the previous C. paradoxa predicted proteome10 that, although found to contain 273 (90%) of core odb9 proteins, was highly fragmented (58% complete, 32% fragmented).To assess the difference in assembly size between the previous (70 Mb) and the current assembly, we aligned the two assemblies using MUMmer 4.0b2 (https://github.com/mummer4/mummer (date last accessed 12 April 2019)) and find that 65.2 Mb of the assembly maps one-to-one between the two genomes, with 87,101 duplicate features annotated (type ‘DUP’) in the new assembly that sum to 34.7 Mb. The one-to-one and duplicate genome feature lengths sum to 99.9 Mb, or the length of the new assembly, and thus the previous assembly size was likely an artefact of repetitive, paralogous and/or multi-copy DNA content that was resolved here with the use of long-read PacBio sequencing. Short-read mapping of 105 million Illumina reads to the new assembly indicates that 91.6% of reads map successfully, with 17.9 million (18.5%) having more than one best placement. A BLASTP analysis (e-val =1×10-10) indicates that 22,678 of 25,831 (87.8%) predicted proteins from the new assembly have hits to the previous proteome (Supplementary Tables S2 and S5), whereas 27,066 of 32,167 (84.1%) predicted proteins from the old assembly have hits to the current proteome (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 5,101 proteins from the previous assembly with no hits, 2,355 have TBLASTN hits (e-val =1×10-10) to the new genome, however only 194 have a BLASTP hit to the NCBI nr database (Supplementary Table S4).We analysed repeat content in the C. paradoxa genome and found that 29.4% is comprised of repetitive elements and 11.5% is unknown repeats (i.e. novel repeats). The repeat landscape of C. paradoxa (Supplementary Fig. S3) indicates little or no expansion of repetitive elements. Only a small proportion of these sequences are long terminal repeats (LTRs: 1.77% of genome) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs; 2.47% of genome). This is in stark contrast to the prominence of LTRs in red algal genomes (e.g. 35.6% in Gracilariopsis chorda) and the greater proportion of LINEs in the genome of the green alga C. reinhardtii (5.6%; Supplementary Fig. S3). These results indicate the expansion of LTRs in red algae and LINEs in chlorophytes after the split from Glaucophyta (e.g. Micromonas commoda, Ostreococcus lucimarinus; Supplementary Fig. S3). The LTRs in the Cyanidioschyzon merolae genome17 show the highest divergence (Supplementary Fig. S3). In Rhodophyta, the gene inventory has remained relatively small (ca. 5–13 K genes) over >1 billion years of evolution, and the growth of genome size in multicellular red seaweeds is largely explained by transposable element (TE) expansion.17 In land plants, TE activity has played a major role in genome size growth but gene families have significantly expanded when compared with green algal groups.17 Within this context of Archaeplastida evolution, C. paradoxa occupies a unique position for a unicellular lineage by encoding a relatively rich gene inventory (e.g. compared with 16,709 genes in C. reinhardtii; https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Chlre4/Chlre4.home.html (date last accessed 12 April 2019))21 but not having undergone large-scale expansion of repetitive elements, as in many plants.Interestingly, we find that translation of our assembled de novo transcriptome dataset revealed 3,510 non-redundant (excluding alternate isoforms) transcripts (see Supplementary Table S6) that encode bi-directional and partially or completely overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) of at least 300 amino acids (900 nucleotides) in length. One such example (shown in Fig. 3A), a ca. 3,050 bp sequence (DN10586_c0_g1_i1: ORF+) on contig (tig)00001085 contains 13 introns and encodes two bidirectional and overlapping ORFs spanning a gene structure predicted by Augustus. In the forward frame (in relation to the predicted structure), the encoded 718-amino acid protein is a putative bacterial-derived ABC transporter with a local BLASTp top hit spanning the entire length of the query to Pontibacter chinhatensis (WP_119433509; 626 AA; E = 0.0; Supplementary Fig. S4). The reverse frame encodes a 715-amino acid protein for which the N-terminal 395 amino acids align via BLASTp to Oscillibacter sp. (CDC69327.1; 453 AA; E = 2×10-22) annotated as a 30S ribosomal protein S5. To test whether these ORFs may represent bidirectionally transcribed genes, we mapped stranded RNA-Seq data to these gene structures (e.g. Fig. 3A), however we found no evidence of their transcription. We consider it extremely unlikely that nucleotide CDS sequences 1–3 kb in size would by chance encode a conserved (i.e. to known NCBI homologues) protein translation (free of stop codons) in the reverse frame after horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to the C. paradoxa nuclear genome and subsequent accrual of 13 spliceosomal introns. Additional work is required to determine the potential biological implication of these findings. Mapping RNA-Seq reads to a region of the Cyanophora paradoxa nuclear genome. (A) Gene structure of a ca. 3,050 bp sequence (DN10586_c0_g1_i1: ORF+) containing 13 introns that encodes overlapping ORFs spanning a gene structure predicted by Augustus. However, only the DN10586_c0_g1_i1: ORF+ has RNA-seq support using stranded transcriptome data. (B) Genomic region showing a chlamydia-derived glycogen debranching enzyme containing 27 introns that shares a predicted 3' UTR with a eukaryote-derived gene (g22709b) encoding a complete eukaryotic glycogenin (GT8) domain involved in glycogen biosynthesis. The stranded RNA-Seq data are mapped to both genes, showing the region of overlap. Reads in dark grey are transcribed from the plus strand, whereas those in olive or light grey are transcribed from the minus strand.Mapping RNA-Seq reads to a region of the Cyanophora paradoxa nuclear genome.

The stranded RNA-Seq data are mapped to both genes, showing the region of overlap. Reads in dark grey are transcribed from the plus strand, whereas those in olive or light grey are transcribed from the minus strand.Many genes however show evidence of overlapping UTRs. The chlamydia-derived glycogen debranching enzyme (glgX [gene tig0021589_g22709]; Supplementary Fig. S5) for example, contains 27 introns and shares a predicted 3' UTR with a eukaryote-derived gene (g22709b) encoding a putative glycogenin (GT8) domain that is involved in glycogen biosynthesis (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S6). This result provides evidence of a bacteria-derived gene that shares a 3' UTR with a host (eukaryotic) gene, both of which are involved in glycogen metabolism. Bidirectional transcription is often associated with gene regulation via short interfering RNAs [siRNAs, as reported in C. paradoxa11] or long-non-coding RNAs that are complementary to mRNAs and involved in transcriptional gene silencing.36–38 Here, we report that C. paradoxa in at least one case co-localizes genes with a related function. The finding of the glycogen gene-pair suggests that other bidirectional and co-expressed genes involved in related functions may be uncovered. If found, this will provide a parallel case to the trebouxiophyte green alga Picochlorum SE3, in which gene co-localization may allow a rapid response to variable environmental conditions.39,403.2. Transcriptomic response to lightWe quantified broad patterns of C. paradoxa gene expression in response to light by conducting a time-course differential gene-expression analysis using RNA-Seq data collected at six time points spanning a 16: 8 light/dark cycle (see Supplementary Text and Figs S7 and S8). Here, we focussed on genes involved in the cell cycle, recognizing that the circadian clock likely controls some of these functions. Expression of the S- and M-phase specific transcripts encoding PCNA and CycB, respectively41 (20) peaked at 8 and 14 h after light exposure (Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating that the cell cycle was likely synchronized in the studied culture. This allowed us to further examine expression patterns of nuclear-encoded cellular and plastid-division-related genes to assess whether coordinated transcriptional regulation occurs during cell cycle progression. Plastid division proceeds via recruitment and assembly of FtsZ filaments by ARC642 prior to constriction of the macromolecular complex. Both ftsZ and arc6 transcripts peak during S-phase within 1 h after exposure to light and decline steadily thereafter, indicating formation of the plastid-dividing (PD) ring on the stromal side. Although Miyagishima et al.41 reported constant expression of ftsZ throughout the cell cycle in cultures synchronized under continuous light using aphidicolin, we find here that significant up-regulation of the transcript occurs in early S-phase. Placement of the PD ring at the future septum is guided by the S-phase specific Min system43 for which minD and minE are present in C. paradoxa and peak ~8 h after light exposure. An outer PD ring has not been observed in C. paradoxa,44 and eukaryotic host-derived genes for plastid division (e.g. drp5B) are absent from the genome, indicating that an alternative mechanism may be responsible for outer envelope division. Although a gene encoding a dynamin-related protein (DRP) that potentially binds the cytosolic plastid division complex was predicted in our assembly, sequence similarity indicates that this is a member of the drp5A family and thus linked only to cytokinesis.45 PG ingrowth at the division site follows,46 and we find that genes encoding proteins involved in PG biosynthesis (pbp1a, murA, murB, ftsI; and see below) are up-regulated and peak at ~8 h after exposure to light, presumably after localization by the Min system. Onset of PD-ring constriction and regulation of the G2/M cycle transition is supported by up-regulation of the mitotic cyclin genes CycA, CycB and cyclin-dependent kinase B (CDKB)47 that reach maximum expression levels ~14 h after exposure to light and begin to drop rapidly 1 h after onset of dark as M-phase progresses. Together, these results indicate transcriptional regulation of nuclear-encoded plastid division genes via the cell cycle as has previously been suggested for Glaucophyta and other algae.41 Whether the cell cycle itself in C. paradoxa is regulated by a circadian clock mechanism remains unclear, because the main control loops have yet to be established. In addition, an undescribed retrograde signalling pathway likely exists in algae that arrest the cell cycle prior to anaphase until constriction of the plastid division site commences.48 Time-course expression data such as those generated in this study will be particularly useful for addressing this issue.Light exposure also resulted in an overall up-regulation of genes shared between pathways involved in genetic information processing, including those responsible for DNA replication/damage repair (DNA replication, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair and homologous recombination) and the cell cycle progression (cell cycle and meiosis). In addition, we found degradation of amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, and lysine degradation) and biosynthesis of N- and O-linked glycans (N-glycan biosynthesis, various types of N-glycan biosynthesis, other types of O-glycan biosynthesis) to be up-regulated along with constituents of the endocytosis and butanoate metabolism pathways (Supplementary Fig. S7). In contrast, significant down-regulation was found for genes (Supplementary Fig. S8) assigned to pathways involved in translation and protein trafficking (ribosome [ribosomal proteins], ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, protein export) along with isoprenoid biosynthesis (terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis), cofactor metabolism (riboflavin metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, folate biosynthesis and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism), and amino acid metabolism (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis).3.3. Eukaryote tree of lifeTo place C. paradoxa in a broader tree of life and test for shared ancestry among multiple microbial eukaryote groups, we adapted and expanded the protocol of Price and Bhattacharya32 to derive de novo ortholog groups (OGs) and constructed a partitioned 3,000 OG dataset from 115 publicly available eukaryote proteomes (Supplementary Table S1). The consensus maximum-likelihood tree (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S10) is consistent with the monophyly of most major eukaryote phyla as has been previously published (see below). This tree also provides strong support for, and therefore confirms a single origin of the Archaeplastida, whose common ancestor hosted the cyanobacterial primary endosymbiosis that gave rise to the plastid in eukaryotes.10,49,50 This result is often found when using multigene datasets from the nuclear51,52 and mitochondrial compartments,53 but Archaeplastida non-monophyly has also been reported in several cases52 using the CAT + GTR + G evolutionary model; figure S2 in Burki et al.54Phylogeny showing the position of Cyanophora paradoxa and other glaucophytes in the eukaryotic tree of life. This tree was constructed using a partitioned 3,000 OG dataset from 115 publicly available eukaryote proteomes, as described in the text and reference.32 All nodes have 100% bootstrap support unless shown otherwise. The full tree is presented in Supplementary Fig. S10. Phylogeny showing the position of Cyanophora paradoxa and other glaucophytes in the eukaryotic tree of life. This tree was constructed using a partitioned 3,000 OG dataset from 115 publicly available eukaryote proteomes, as described in the text and reference.32 All nodes have 100% bootstrap support unless shown otherwise. The full tree is presented in Supplementary Fig. S10. In support of the monophyly hypothesis, analysis of single genes from the C. paradoxa genome by Price et al.10 showed that of 4,445 maximum-likelihood trees analysed, over 60% supported a sister group relationship between glaucophytes and red and/or green algae plus plants at a bootstrap support =90%. In addition to the monophyly of the glaucophyte and green lineages based on plastid-encoded genes, Lee et al.55 also identified 23 OGs in the nuclear genomes of both lineages that were transferred to the nucleus (i.e. totalling 93 gene families) from the genome of the ancestor of the Glaucophyta + Viridiplantae plastid. This shared history of endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) supports the monophyly of these two lineages within Archaeplastida. In comparison, only four such OGs are common to all three lineages, and only one primordial OG is common to the greens and rhodophytes.Our genome-wide analysis also strongly supports the early divergence of the red algae, with glaucophytes and Viridiplantae forming a well-supported clade (100% bootstrap support), a conclusion that was also reached in a recent study of nuclear data [351 protein dataset, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analysis; see Fig. 1 in Brown et al.52] and of plastid data [60 proteins shared by the Archaeplastida and cyanobacteria; see Fig. 5, Supplementary S23 in Lee et al.55). This conclusion is at odds with several other studies. For example, Li et al.56 identified compositional biases among first and third positions of nucleotides in plastid amino acid codons and settled on an early divergence of glaucophytes based on protein data and plastid morphology (i.e. presence/absence of PG). They could not, however, significantly reject competing topologies. A basal divergence of glaucophytes within Archaeplastida was also found by Ponce-Toledo et al.57 in an analysis of a concatenated dataset of 97 plastid proteins that included the putative bacterial ancestor of plastids; i.e. the lineage including the freshwater species Gloeomargarita lithophora. This topology suggested that plastid primary endosymbiosis occurred in a freshwater environment, and glaucophytes are freshwater taxa.9 However, our finding of an early split of Rhodophyta within Archaeplastida does not argue against a freshwater environment for plastid endosymbiosis, because many early diverging red algal clades include freshwater taxa such as in the Compsopogonophyceae and Porphyridiophyceae.9Chlamydial HGT candidates in Glaucophyta.

Insights into the ultrastructure of cyanophora paradoxaWe studied cell ultrastructure to provide a morphology-based perspective on the place of glaucophytes in the tree of life. Here, we used quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy (QFDEEM),61 a powerful technique to study the ultrastructure of microorganisms because no chemical fixatives or dehydrating procedures are needed. We focussed on the distinguishing features of C. paradoxa, rather than address all aspects of its cell morphology.These are a system of flattened membrane-delimited sacs/cisternae that are located beneath the cell membrane and linked together by narrow domains referred to as sutures. Alveoli are present in all studied members of the Alveolata, but absent from red and green algae and land plants. Their presence in glaucophytes, reported in several earlier studies62,63 represent an evolutionary enigma. Supplementary Figs S11 and S12 validate earlier studies and highlight alveolar fine structure in QFDEEM replicas of C. paradoxa.In cyanobacteria, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) localizes to encapsulated cytoplasmic inclusions referred to as carboxysomes64 (Supplementary Fig. S13). The glaucophyte plastid contains a central non-encapsulated pyrenoid (also termed a central body9) (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs S14–S16) where RuBisCO is localized.65 Carboxysome/glaucophyte-pyrenoid homology was an appealing idea that was studied using genetic tools,66 but the pyrenoid is clearly in direct contact with the stroma, weakening the idea of a glaucophyte carboxysome. In most red and green algae, pyrenoids are traversed by one or more thylakoids (shown in Supplementary Fig. S15B for the green alga Chlamydomonas), but in some instances this is not the case,67,68 as in glaucophytes.The glaucophyte thylakoid system has a configuration which at first glance appears to be either concentric rings, like an onion, or a spiral (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs S15 and S16), but inspection of cross-sectioned thin-section images, such as Fig. 1 in Fathinejad et al.,66 demonstrates that the thylakoids occasionally terminate or bifurcate. Their regular separation is mediated by a system of phycobilisomes that associate with the thylakoid surfaces and interdigitate with one another, and by a rigid envelope that maintains a spherical shape (see below). The few thylakoid termini adjacent to the central pyrenoid (Supplementary Fig. S15A, arrows) lack associated phycobilisomes, are dilated, contain an osmiophilic material,66,69 and possibly mark the domain of thylakoid assembly; i.e. the ‘thylakoid centre’ in cyanobacteria.70Giddings et al.71 published a detailed study of thylakoid and phycobilisome structure in isolated C. paradoxa plastids, including precise measurements of their components. Our in vivo images (Supplementary Figs S16–S18) largely confirm their observations. In Supplementary Fig. S16, we note the parallel between phycobilisome organization in C. paradoxa (Supplementary Fig. S16A) and in the red alga Galdieria sulphuraria (Supplementary Fig. S16B). Supplementary Fig. S17 documents a parallel between the rows of thylakoid B-face intramembranous particles in C. paradoxa (Supplementary Fig. S17A and C) and in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus 7002 (Supplementary Fig. S17B). Such rows are also present in red algae,72 and presumably reflect phycobilisome interactions.Cyanobacteria, like all Gram-negative bacteria, assemble a layer of PG, a polymer of distinctive sugars and amino acids, between their outer and inner membranes.73 At the onset of division, the PG layer thickens and invaginates to form a medial furrow that constricts the inner membrane centripetally. The outer membrane follows inward, and the membranes fuse to create two daughters. In some QFDEEM images of the cyanobacterial furrow, the PG layer appears amorphous (Supplementary Fig. S19A), whereas others show the presence of filamentous material (Supplementary Fig. S19B).Several studies have shown that glaucophytes synthesize PG74–76 that surrounds the plastid and extends into the furrow. Giddings et al.71 presented images of a thin smooth layer of material between the outer and inner membranes of the plastid envelope in freeze-fracture replicas of isolated organelles. Kojima et al.77 isolated PG from C. paradoxa and studied the plastid outer membrane proteins CppS/F that confer permeability and are of non-cyanobacterial (likely Planctomycete origin). Such material is not evident in QFDEEM cross-fractures in situ (Supplementary Fig. S20A) and is absent from thin-sectioned cross-sections of the moss chloroplast envelope78,79 which has been suggested, using a metabolic labelling ‘click chemistry’ approach, to be surrounded by PG-related material.79 In contrast, a wall layer is clearly present between the outer and inner membranes of the a-cyanobacterial primary endosymbiont (chromatophore) in Paulinella chromatophore.80 The surface of isolated plastids also appears to be smooth and wall-like in SEM images.44 Evidence that this material is PG comes from pigment release when C. paradoxa plastids are treated with lysozyme (56) and the finding of plastid swelling when cells are treated with penicillin.81A medial invagination of the glaucophyte plastid inner membrane persists throughout interphase (Supplementary Fig. S20B), which transforms into a cleavage furrow when the plastid divides (Supplementary Fig. S20C). In contrast, medial invaginations are only seen in cyanobacteria during cell division. Material within the glaucophyte invagination appears amorphous in some images66,71,82,83 and includes filaments in others44,62,69 (Supplementary Fig. S20B and C). Further evidence for PG in the furrow rests on the localization of the PG-hydrolysing enzyme DipM to the C. paradoxa furrow.84 FtsZ ring formation is also involved in cleavage-furrow formation.44The PG layer of bacterial walls is resistant to solubilization by non-ionic detergents such as NP-40. We therefore tested the integrity of the C. paradoxa plastid to detergent exposure. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S21, these plastids are unaffected by 1% NP-40 (as well as 5% NP-40; data not shown). In comparison, plastids of the green alga C. reinhardtii are fully solubilized by 0.1% NP-40.85Included in our replicas are high-quality images of the C. paradoxa mitochondrion (Supplementary Fig. S18B) and the contractile vacuole, Golgi, and mucocysts in the cell anterior (Supplementary Fig. S22). An etched view of flagellar surfaces shows two kinds of mastigonemes (flagellar hairs), one short and flat (Fig. 2B), and the other long and narrow (Fig. 2C and D). The etched surface of the flagellar membrane shows units with a donut configuration (Fig. 2C) that are absent from the plasma membrane surface (Supplementary Figs S11A and S12A), demonstrating that in C. paradoxa, as in most eukaryotes,86 the two membranes are distinctive.3.5. Evolutionary history of PG biosynthesis in glaucophytesA detailed discussion of the composition and function of PG enzymes in glaucophytes can be found in Price et al.9 Here, we addressed phylogenetic origins of the major PG enzymes that were recovered with strong BLASTp (E = 10-10) support in the PacBio assembly of C. paradoxa to complement the analysis of PG ultrastructure and the cell cycle data. The genes (see Supplementary Table S7) we analysed come from table in Price et al.9 and comprise: PG transglycosylase/transpeptidase (PBP1, 2, and 3), two isoforms of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (murA), UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase (murB), UDP-N-acetylmuramate-l-alanine ligase (murC), two putative glutamate racemase homologues (murI), a hypothetical d-Glu-adding enzyme (murD), UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (murE), a hypothetical alanine racemase (alr), d-alanine-d-alanine ligase (ddl), UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide-d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (murF), phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase (Lipid I synthesis, mraY), undecaprenyldiphospho-muramoylpentapeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Lipid II synthesis, murG), a hypothetical PG splitting enzyme (dipM), a hypothetical glucosamine-6-P-synthase (glmS), d-alanyl-d-alanine dipeptidase (vanX), d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase (vanY), and d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase (dacB/PBP5). Phylogenetic analysis of individual proteins using the novel glaucophyte genomic data shows that many of them are of cyanobacterial provenance in C. paradoxa (e.g. PBP1/2, murF, and mraY), but a variety of different bacteria have also contributed to this pathway suggesting a history of HGT-derived gene replacement in C. paradoxa. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the plastid donor encoded this taxonomically diverse set of PG genes prior to primary endosymbiosis (Supplementary Fig. S23 and Table S7).87 As described above, the two homologous proteins CppS/F are PG-associated and provide a channel to allow diffusion of small substrates across the outer plastid membrane.77 Proteins imported into the plastid rely on the Toc-Tic-based translocon complexes, but it is not understood how they cross the intervening PG layer.3.6. Analysis of chlamydial HGTsSome of us previously proposed the ‘ménage à trois’ hypothesis (MATH) to explain the presence of the chlamydial HGT signal in Archaeplastida genomes by positing a direct role of Chlamydiales in the metabolic integration of the ancestral plastid.88,89 Under the MATH, Chlamydiales housed the cyanobiont inside the parasitic inclusion, thereby protecting it from host antibacterial defences. Direct conjugative transfer is postulated to have occurred within the inclusion from the chlamydial cell to the cyanobiont. The genes transferred encoded chlamydial transporters that were required either to export photosynthate (UhpC) and tryptophan (TyrP) or to import ATP in darkness. This would have created selection for the captured cyanobacterium to export carbon, amino acids, and vitamins to the inclusion lumen for pathogen benefit. Genes of tryptophan,88,89 isoprenoid, and menaquinone core synthesis (Cenci et al., unpublished data) were also possibly transferred to support the required biochemical fluxes in the cyanobiont. In contrast, the overflow of carbon from the cyanobiont was putatively exported to the host cytosol where chlamydial enzyme effectors would have connected the tripartite symbiosis by incorporating excess carbon into host glycogen stores.89,90To reassess the chlamydial contribution using the improved genome assembly from C. paradoxa in combination with an expanded bacterial genome database, we manually inspected the phylogenomic trees and found 35 well supported and 2 more weakly supported candidates (Supplementary Table S8). The well-supported chlamydial set includes 17 HGTs shared by all Archaeplastida lineages, whereas 3 and 5 genes are putatively shared exclusively with green and red algae, respectively. The remaining 10 genes (all present in at least 2 glaucophyte species that form a monophyletic clade and containing introns) are likely to be glaucophyte-specific HGTs. Therefore ca. 49% (likely an under-estimate due to lineage-specific gene losses that mask ancient HGT origins) of the chlamydial contribution can be traced back to the early stages of plastid endosymbiosis, prior to the radiation of Archaeplastida. Using plastid proteomics, Facchinelli et al.91 found that in contrast to other Archaeplastida, where glycolysis partitions between the plastid and cytosol,92,C. paradoxa retains the full glycolytic/neoglucogenic suite of enzymes, including phosphoglyceromutase (PGAM) and enolase, within the plastid stroma. This result is consistent with the paucity of candidate transporters in the C. paradoxa plastid membrane, specifically one that can translocate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). In this context, our finding of glaucophyte-specific chlamydial HGT candidates with respect to PPDK (pyruvate phosphate dikinase; Fig. 5A) that gave rise to a gene family in this species and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI; Fig. 5B) may reflect the ancestral transfer of genes required to boost anaerobic glycolysis in the nascent plastid. Previous experimental work using Entamoeba histolytica recombinant enzymes93 showed that TPI, PGAM, and PPDK have the highest (i.e. with respect to other pH) control coefficient values at pH 7 for anaerobic glycolysis, and PGAM is a well-supported chlamydial HGT candidate in the green lineage.90Pyrophosphate-dependent anaerobic glycolysis enzymes are absent from cyanobacteria Gloeobacterales sensu lato (inclusive of G. lithophora). Early implementation of such a pathway during plastid endosymbiosis would have relieved ATP starvation under hypoxia in darkness because the cyanobacterial endosymbiont was likely exporting large amounts of photosynthetic carbon (G6P) and energy-costly compounds such as vitamin K and tryptophan. Of relevance here is the finding of bacterial-derived GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) to Glaucophyta (Supplementary Fig. S24). In the presence of high CA activity, PEPCK is known in bacteria to fix CO2 into PEP to generate GTP and OAA94), which could have been further metabolized at the early stages of plastid endosymbiosis by menaquinone-driven respiration in the microaerophilic environment of the chlamydial inclusion.90 The coupling of anaerobic glycolysis with ‘microaerophilic’ respiration would have been an efficient way to maintain ATP homeostasis in darkness under hypoxic stress, avoiding ATP hydrolysis and maximizing the use of pyrophosphate produced by other pathways. The idea that ATP starvation in darkness was a major stress experienced by the incipient cyanobacterium at the onset of plastid primary endosymbiosis is consistent with the chlamydial derivation of the ATP/ADP translocase in the Archaeplastida ancestor.95Two types of HGT signal would result from the proposed tripartite symbiosis under the MATH. The first is analogous to the expected HGTs from different bacterial sources during the process of organelle DNA degeneration. These genes were needed to resurrect plastid pathways, such as for the biosynthesis of different amino acids (e.g. Paulinella chromatophora95). The second HGT signal would reflect the ancient cyanobacteria/pathogen biotic interaction. These genes, present on the chimeric plastid genome, would have their frequency of transfer boosted by EGT rather than HGT, in particular when the pathways or transporters were not initially encoded by the cyanobacterium. We postulate that HGT/EGT of the genes encoding UhpC, NTT, and TyrP transporters, as well the genes of tryptophan, isoprenoid, and menaquinone biosynthesis, represent such ancient biotic interactions.89 This hypothesis is supported by the observation of multiple chlamydial transfers in these pathways, most of which are shared by all three Archaeplastida lineages. The idea is also consistent with the finding of chlamydial HGTs that encode transporters required to export the final products of the proposed biotic interactions (e.g. photosynthetic carbon, tryptophan) in the proposed inclusion. Finally, these ideas are also strengthened by our current knowledge of chlamydial biology concerning, for instance, the recognized central importance of tryptophan metabolism and hypoxia in the chlamydial replication cycle.96Therefore, we suggest that anaerobic glycolysis under control of PiPi-dependent phosphofructokinase, TPI, PGAM, PPDK, CA, and GTP-dependent PEPCK, whose HGT/EGTs from Chlamydiae and other bacteria are suggested in this work, may reflect an ancient biotic interaction. This process resulted in the intracellular transfer of these genes to the ancestral cyanobacterium due to its location in the chlamydial inclusion. The Glaucophyta are of particular interest under the MATH because unlike the distinct cytosol/plastid partitioning of glycolysis in the red and green lineages, C. paradoxa appears to represent the ancestral condition of maintaining all these functions in the plastid.4. Conclusive remarksIn summary, the significantly improved genome assembly presented and analysed here provides several important insights. First, the phylogenetic analysis of a partitioned 3,000 OG dataset from 115 eukaryote proteomes that includes the new C. paradoxa gene models provides robust support for Archaeplastida monophyly. This analysis also supports with high bootstrap values most of the other existing supergroups. Noteworthy aspects of the C. paradoxa genome include its gene richness and low repeat composition with a relatively small contribution made by LTRs and LINEs. The finding of shared overlapping UTRs may indicate selection in at least one instance to co-localize functionally related genes. Any putative functional role of accessory ORFs encoded within the transcripts of C. paradoxa awaits further investigation. The ultrastructure work underlines many well-accepted aspects of glaucophyte cell morphology. Finally, the inventory of chlamydial and other bacterial HGTs in key pathways provides a novel lens to address the ancient biotic interactions driven by plastid primary endosymbiosis. In summary, our work further underlines the importance of C. paradoxa as a model species for understanding ancient events in algal evolution. Improved methods of genome sequencing and assembly provide the impetus to analyse additional glaucophyte genomes to discover the extent of divergence and footprints of ancient events driven by endosymbiosis in the ancestor of these taxa.We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions to improve the quality of this manuscript.FundingThis research was funded by the National Science Foundation (0936884 and 1317114) to D.B.

IntroductionGene expression is generally defined as the decoding of DNA information into proteins, which includes two basic steps: transcription of DNA into RNA and translation of RNA into protein. Although these two steps occur in the same spot in prokaryotes, they are separated at different subcellular locations in eukaryote.1 This separation, along with the complicated gene structure, enables more fine and complex regulations on the eukaryotic gene expression. Among all regulations, alternative splicing (AS), defined as the inclusion of different exons into mature mRNA, is an important mechanism that could dramatically increase the diversity of transcriptome and proteome, and hence regulating different physiological and developmental processes in eukaryote.2,3 Furthermore, AS could also regulate gene expression level and spatio-temporal specificity.4 Studies have shown that >90% genes in human and >60% multi-exon genes in Arabidopsis undergo AS.5,6 There are five major AS groups, intron retention (IR), exon skipping (ES), alternative donor (AD), alternative acceptor (AA) and alternative position (AP), of which IR is prevalent in plants,7 whereas, ES is more common in mammals.8,9Although the functions of most multiple isoforms generated by AS remain uncovered, several studies have demonstrated the biological importance of AS in different physiological and developmental processes. Studies showed that the Bcl-x gene in Drosophila could produce two isoforms playing contradicting roles with one activating apoptosis while the other one inhibiting apoptosis.10 Studies have also shown the function differentiation of the same genes with different transcripts in plants. In Arabidopsis, AS of zinc-induced facilitator-like 1 (ZIFL1) gene could generate two isoforms: ZIFL1.1 and ZIFL1.3, of which the former influences polar transportation of auxin in roots, whereas the latter regulates the movement of stomatal.11 In other examples, different transcripts of YUCCA4 show different features with respect to subcellular localization and tissue specificity,12 and also different PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR6 (PIF6) transcripts in the ABA-dependent seed germination play different functions.13 Different AS isoforms are involved in stress response and circadian in Arabidopsis.14–17 Similar discoveries have also been obtained in cereals, such as the Rough endosperm3 (Rgh3) gene (>19 transcript isoforms) of maize involved in endosperm differentiation and two transcripts of OsDR11 gene of rice involved in the process of disease resistance.18,19Due to the biological importance of AS and the reduction of sequencing cost, comprehensive surveys of AS have been conducted widely in plants using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which include Arabidopsis and other types of crops.20–22 Although, the NGS has been proven to be powerful, it still faces limitation in accurate identification of each isoform because of its short sequencing reads,23 which is much more serious in polyploid species or species with abundant repetitive genome sequences. However, with the advent of PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology, known as the third generation of sequencing technology, full-length sequence of mRNA could be obtained without in silico sequence assembly.24 Because of its ability to generate much longer reads, it can easily detect the existence of different transcripts in each gene, making it appropriate in gene annotation and AS analysis compared with the new-generation sequencing technology.25 This SMART technology has been successfully applied in the analysis of AS in different plant species, and emerged to be efficient in enhancing the accuracy of AS identification.26–30Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera), which belongs to the family of Nelumbonaceae, is a basal eudicot.31 It is a crucial species in plant phylogenetics study because it is a slowly evolved and early branching eudicot and retained many ancestral phenotypic features similar to monocots.32,33 Besides, it is also an important aquatic horticultural plant,34 thus increasing the necessity to get a better comprehension of lotus. After the successful sequencing and annotation of the genome of two wild strains of sacred lotus, ‘China Antique’ and ‘Chinese Tai-zi’,33,35 the genome database for ‘China Antique’ has been constructed.36 However, the genome is poorly annotated because of the short reads and redundant repeat sequences. Although the construction of high resolutions genetic map could aid in genome assembly, more information at transcription level is required to achieve a fine annotation.To get a comprehensive survey of AS events in sacred lotus, we applied both PacBio SMRT and Illumina-based sequencing of the transcriptome from 16 different tissues of ‘China Antique’. The isoforms identified by both techniques were compared, and the tissue and developmental stage specific AS transcripts were identified and annotated in different tissues. The findings showed the complexity of AS events, while providing comprehensive transcriptome data for further genome annotation on sacred lotus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsNelumbo nucifera ‘China Antique’ was cultivated in Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS (114°30'E, 30°60'N) China. Root, leaf, petiole, and rhizome (elongation zone, internode, and apical meristem) tissues, which were used for sequencing, were collected. Samples of petal, receptacle, immature stamen, and unpollinated carpel were sampled on the blooming day (0 d post-anthesis, DPA), while samples of pollinated carpel were collected from 12 h after pollination. Mature stamen and receptacle at 2 DPA, seed-coat at 6, 12, 18 DPA, and cotyledon at 9, 12, and 15 DPA were collected. In total, there are 19 different samples which were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for further RNA extraction.2.2. RNA preparation and Illumina RNA-seqFor each sample, total RNA was extracted using the RNAprep pure Plant Kit (TIANGEN). After quality checking by 1% agarose gels, the RNA concentration and integrity were examined using an Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), respectively. Eligible RNA of each sample (3 µg) was used for constructing the Illumina sequencing library following the recommendations of NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA). The library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at Novogene company (Nanjing, China) and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated.2.3. Single-molecule sequencing of pooled RNA samplesIn order to obtain the complete information of full-length transcriptome, total RNA from 19 different samples were pooled together in an equal quantity to construct libraries for PacBio sequencing. The mixed RNA sample was reverse transcribed using the Clontech SMARTer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cDNA Synthesis Kit and oligo (dT). Large-scale PCR amplification was carried out to generate barcode full-length cDNA. The BluePippin Size Selection System protocol as described by Pacific Biosciences (PN 100-092-800-03) was used to separate the size of PCR selection for mix sample >4 kb. After damage repairing and end joining, the full-length cDNA is ligated to the SMRT dump bell joint. These cDNA products were purified for Iso-Seq SMRTBell library preparation. A SMRT cells were sequenced on the PacBio Sequel System platform.2.4. PacBio reads mappingThe raw data generated from PacBio Sequel sequencing system was processed using the SMRTlinks 5.0 software with min-Length of 200 and min-Read-Score of 0.75. The Circular Consensus sequences (CCSs) were generated from subreads with pass 1 and accuracy >0.8. According to whether the 5'- and 3'-cDNA primers were present and whether there was a poly-A tail signal preceding the 3'-primer, a CCS or subread sequence was divided into full length, non-full length, and chimeric reads. The method of Iterative Clustering for Error Correction (ICE) was employed for iterative clustering to obtain the consensus reads. Polished consensus reads were acquired from the original consensus corrected with non-full-length read using Arrow. To improve consensus accuracy, we use Illumina RNA-seq data to correct the consensus reads with LoRDEC.37 Aligning high-quality full-length consensus reads to the reference using GMAP38 with >85% alignment coverage and >90% alignment identity. PRAP,39 a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, was used to identify alternative transcription initiation (ATI), AS, alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) by full-length consensus reads. And TACO40 was used to combine transcripts from SMRT and Illumina RNA-seq into a consensus merged transcriptome and TransDecoder v5.3.0 was applied to predict the open reading frame. EVidenceModeler (EVM)41 was used to predict confident consensus gene models by using the merged transcriptome.2.5. Identification of fusion transcriptsTo identify fusion transcripts, a Python script in the PBTRANSCRIPT-ToFU42 package was used. The criteria for a candidate fusion transcript was as follows: transcript must be mapped at least two loci in the reference genome and the interval of each loci should be longer than 10 kb; the sequence from the mapped loci should cover more than 99% of the fusion transcript, with sequence from each locus in the fusion transcript covering at least 10%. To further obtain high-quality candidates, the transcripts whose loci in scaffolds other than the nine megascaffolds were filtrated.2.6. Differential expression analysis based on Illumina dataAfter quality control, clean reads were obtained by removing reads containing adapters, reads containing ploy-Ns and low-quality reads from raw data. The clean reads were mapped to the lotus reference genome v1.133 with Tophat2 v2.1.0 with the default setting. Cufflinks v2.2.1 was used to quantify the expression level of genes and isoforms using the GTF annotation file generated by SMRT and RNA-seq merged transcriptome. To explore tissue-bias expression patterns of isoforms, Mean FPKM >0.1 and coefficient of variation of FPKM (standard deviation divided by mean) >2 were used as the threshold to filter isoforms for hierarchical and k-means clustering analysis in R. The value of k was set to 12, which equals to the number of tissues used in this study. Isoforms or genes with significantly differential expression were identified under the threshold FC (fold change) of FPKM >2 by using the Cuffdiff command between pairwise samples. The significant can be either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, depending on whether P is greater than the FDR after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple-testing. Comparing with other tissues, the genes or isoforms which showed significantly higher expression were identified as tissue-specific genes or isoforms.2.7. AS analysisSUPPA43 was employed to classify the AS events with the parameter -f ioe. It produces seven kinds of local event types including Skipping Exon (SE), Alternative 5' Splice Sites (A5), Alternative 3' Splice Sites (A3), Mutually Exclusive Exons (MX), Retained Intron (RI), Alternative First Exons (AF) and Alternative Last Exons (AL). Quantification of the differential expression by AS events was carried out using the rMATS.44 The output from rMATS, included the differential expression of five main AS events as SE, A5, A3, MX, and RI, was filtered for Inclusion Level Difference >5% and FDR <0.01.2.8. Functional annotation and gene ontology enrichment analysesTo investigate the functions of all isoforms, KOBAS2.045 was used to map all the isoform sequence to gene ontology (GO),46 KEGG,47 KOG, Pfam, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and Nr database. A GOseq R package based on Wallenius non-central hyper-geometric distribution48 was run to obtain the significantly enriched GO terms. Concurrently, all lotus genes were searched against Arabidopsis TAIR10 with BLAST (e-value <1e-6) to obtain best hits for further functional annotation.2.9. Reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA (1 µg) from samples were used for first strand cDNA with reverse transcription system, and the product of reaction systems was diluted to 200 µL before reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Primers were designed to span the splicing events using Primer Premier software (v.5.0) (Supplementary Table S1). The PCR fragments were tested in 1% agarose gel and sequenced by Sanger method. The qRT-PCR reactions were performed on the Bio-Rad using the SYBR. The reaction procedure was initiated at 95°C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s with fluorescence detection. Relative gene expressions were analysed using 2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>CT method, with the lotus ß-Actin gene used as an internal standard.3. Result3.1. Sequencing of N. nucifera transcriptome through SMRTIn order to obtain a comprehensive full-length transcriptome for N. nucifera, high-quality RNA was extracted from the above-mentioned 19 different samples including some tissues at different developmental stages. The same amount of RNA per sample was pooled, and size-fractionated library was sequenced on one SMRT cell using PacBio Sequel system. The raw data were then subjected to a series of analyses sequentially (Supplementary Fig. S1). After filtering out low-quality raw reads (length <200 bp and sequence accuracy <0.75) a total of 10,481,648 Reads of Inserts (ROI, 14.55 G) were obtained (Table 1). Further analysis using the Iso-seq protocol generated 670,929 CCSs (Table 1), among which 151,262 and 519,667 were classified as non-full-length and full-length sequences (the reads with 5' primers, 3' primers and poly-A tails), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1). After excluding the chimeric reads, 457,565 full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads were clustered using the consensus sequences based on ICE algorithm, accumulating 211,802 polished consensus reads (Table 1). The length of the 211,802 polished consensus reads ranged from 137 bp to 17,645 bp with an average of 2,233 bp (Table 1; Fig. 1a), similar to the 80th percentile value of the reference annotation gene length of 2,184 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2).

(e) Ratio of intra- and inter-chromosome fusion transcripts.Summary of PacBio Iso-Seq datasetSummary of PacBio Iso-Seq datasetTo further improve the accuracy of the consensus reads, Illumina RNA-seq was also applied on the same 19 samples separately. A total of 1.6 billion high-quality short reads were obtained (Supplementary Table S2). Subsequently, we utilized LoRDEC to improve the accuracy of transcripts. The corrected consensus reads were then mapped to the lotus reference genome using GMAP. A total of 192,690 (90.98%) non-redundant isoforms were mapped to unique sequences on the genome, including 105,814 and 86,876 to the ‘+’ and ‘-’ strands, respectively, and 3,639 (1.72%) were mapped to multi-sequences, while the rest were not mapped onto the genome (Table 1; Fig.1b). Moreover, the distribution densities of these full-length consensus reads in reference genome are similar among different megascaffolds, except for megascaffold 4 being the densest one (Fig.1c).3.2. Improving N. nucifera genome annotation by SMRT sequencingConsidering the advantage of the sequencing length of SMRT technique, much focus has been directed towards the optimization of gene structure and discovery new transcript isoforms, thus leading to the development of various data analysis tools and pipelines, such as TAPIS27 and IDP.49 Post-transcriptional Regulation Analysis Pipeline for Iso-Seq (PRAPI) was used in the identification of post-transcriptional regulation for its celerity and one-stop operation employed in this study. APA and ATI has been deemed to have capacity for regulating gene expression and increasing transcriptome complexity.50 Using the RPAPI, 22,314 genes detected by PacBio have at least one poly(A) site, with 4,850 genes having at least five ploy(A) sites (Supplementary Table S3; Figs 1d and 2). The average number of poly(A) site per gene was 3.07. The ATI events were identified in 11,719 genes detected by PacBio (Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 2). In addition, 271 transcripts mapped at different chromosomes or different loci in the same chromosome were identified as fusion transcripts (Supplementary Table S5; Fig. 2), with the inter-chromosome fusion transcripts being predominant (Fig. 1e).To obtain comprehensive information of their function, all the isoforms were mapped in different database as described in M&M. The functions of total 32,121 genes identified by Illumina and PacBio data were annotated (Supplementary Table S6). The existing version of lotus reference genome contains 26,685 annotated genes.33 In this study, 192,690 unique full-length isoforms were aligned to the reference genome. Further analysis revealed that 19,332 of the reference annotated genes, corresponding to 75,068 transcripts, were supported by one or more full-length reads. A lot of isoforms could not be matched to any of the reference genes, indicating the existence of novel genes. Combining the existing mass of multiple RNA-seq datasets and the new sequencing reads in this study to map against the reference version (Fig. 2), 6,881 novel genes were identified. Approximately one-third (2,456) of the novel genes were supported by both Illumina and PacBio datasets, and the other two-thirds were supported by Illumina (2,298) and PacBio (2,127) data, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3; Table S7). To verify the existence of these new genes, a total of 20 new genes were randomly selected and identified by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4). It seems that Illumina-seq and PacBio datasets had nearly similar contribution in discovering novel genes, although the depth of these two was different. To evaluate the homology of these novel genes in Arabidopsis, BLAST analyses were carried out using blastn as described in the Materials and methods section. There are only 396 novel genes with at least one significant match against Arabidopsis cDNA. CIRCOS visualization of distribution of different data at genome-wide level.

A total of 7,554 TFs of 50 families were predicted in lotus genome using iTAK tool, and their distribution and gene loci are shown in (Supplementary Fig. S5; Fig. 2). The main TFs identified in our research belong to the MYB (655), AP2 (562), bHLH (531), and C3H (494) families.3.3. Analysis of ASBased on the method described in M&M, a total of 104,288 AS events were identified from 16,543 reference gene models, accounting for 63.47% of the total annotated protein-coding genes (Supplementary Table S8). To obtain detailed information, the frequency of seven primary AS types, including skipping exon (SE), mutually exclusive exon (MX), alternative 5' splice-site (A5), alternative 3' splice-site (A3), retained intron (RI), alternative first exon (AF), alternative last exon (AL), and the number of corresponding annotated genes were calculated (Fig. 3a). The most abundant AS events in lotus is A3 followed by RI and A5, which is different from other plants having RI as the major AS event. Among the genes regulated by AS, about two-thirds of them (67.33%) were associated with A3 events, and only 5.4% of them were associated with MX events. We found 4,944 (44.38%) of genes regulated by A3 events having one A3 gene loci, the highest number of A3 event identified in a single gene was 38 (Supplementary Table S8). We analysed the AS based on PacBio and Illumina datasets, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6), in order to gain further insights on the effect of different sequencing techniques on the AS events. Although the number of AS events identified by RNA-seq is more compared with the AS identified by PacBio-Seq, the ratios among different AS events are very similar, with A3 being the major AS event (Supplementary Fig. S6a). Characterization of AS events and percentage of AS events in tissues. (a) Characterization of AS events. Seven different types of AS events were showed. The number of AS events and corresponding percentage of all AS events were calculated. The number of gene associated with AS event and proportions of these genes occupying all genes undergoing AS. (b) Distribution of five main types of AS events in different tissues.Characterization of AS events and percentage of AS events in tissues. (a) Characterization of AS events. Seven different types of AS events were showed. The number of AS events and corresponding percentage of all AS events were calculated. The number of gene associated with AS event and proportions of these genes occupying all genes undergoing AS. (b) Distribution of five main types of AS events in different tissues.To ascertain the relative importance of the five main models of AS (RI, SE, A3, A5, and MX) in different developmental stages, the RNA-seq datasets of different samples was used to identify AS events, respectively (Fig. 3b). Splicing mode was generally uniform across the 19 samples with little variation on the ratio of different AS events among different tissues. Excluding the two fast growing tissues (elongation zone and apical meristem), RI was the common in all samples, accounting for approximately 31% of alternative transcripts. The number of A3 was the second most predominant. Moreover, the degree of the gene model regulated by AS events in every sample is different, indicating the potential existence of specifically expressive AS events (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table S8). To filtrate the tissue-specifically expressed AS events (SEASs), rMATS were used in our study.44 Among the 12 tissues, a total of 370 SEASs were predicted according to the expression of the splice junctions (Supplementary Fig. S6b; Supplementary Table S9). In particular, the largest number of SEASs found in stamen and carpel tissues, followed by receptacle and seed cotyledon, while no SEASs is identified in the elongation zone. Out of the 370 SEASs, SE was the major one among the five main types of AS events. These results showed that AS might be more preferentially occurring in fast-changing and rapid developing tissues.To avoid the possible interference by false assembly or informatics artefacts, AS events were generated randomly through the selection of 10 genes to perform independent validation by RT-PCR (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S7). We designed primers for the neighbouring regions of these AS junctions and judged the existence of AS events on the basis of the multiple bands. The gel banding pattern and the expected size of the fragments were consistent with the amplified splice isoforms. Some splicing fragments have precedence for high expression in specific tissue. For example, an AS junction from gene XLOC_025058, predicted as SEASs, had tissue-preferential high expression in the petal (Supplementary Fig. S7). An isoform from gene XLOC_019602, produced by an SE event, exhibited high expression level in the petal, stamen, and petiole but low or none in other tissues (Fig. 4).

Tissue-specific genes and isoformsOne of the primary analyses with Illumina sequencing data involves the identification of differentially expressed genes. Pairwise comparisons among all different tissue samples were performed according to the criteria of fold change >2 and FDR <0.05, to identify the differentially expressed genes and tissue-specific genes. A total of 13,425 genes were identified as tissue-specific genes (Supplementary Table S10), and five randomly selected tissue-specific genes were identified by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S8). The number of seed-coat-specific genes (2,477) is obviously more than any other tissues (Fig. 5), indicating the unique feature of seed-coat. Interestingly, there are very few elongation zone and apical meristem specific genes (Fig. 5), revealing they are not fully differentiated tissues. Characterization of tissue-specific genes and isoforms. (a) Distribution of the number of tissue-specific gene and tissue-specific isoform. (b) Percentage of tissue-specific isoforms corresponding non-tissue-specific gene and tissue-specific gene.Characterization of tissue-specific genes and isoforms. (a) Distribution of the number of tissue-specific gene and tissue-specific isoform. (b) Percentage of tissue-specific isoforms corresponding non-tissue-specific gene and tissue-specific gene.In order to explore the functions of these tissue-specific genes, GO functional enrichment analysis was conducted for these 12 tissues, separately (Supplementary Fig. S9). Tissue-specific genes were classified into three categories (biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components). In the seed-coat, the most enriched GO terms were ‘regulation of meristem growth’, ‘cysteine biosynthetic process’, ‘response to karrikin’, ‘plant-type cell wall’, and ‘integral component of membrane’. The elongation zone of the rhizome had the least tissue-specific genes, and the functions of these genes were enriched in ‘iron ion binding’ and ‘oxidoreductase activity’. The function of these tissue-specific genes was closely related to the physiological status of the corresponding tissues. For example, in leaf, the most enriched GO terms in cellular component category was ‘chloroplast stroma’, ‘chloroplast thylakoid membrane’, and ‘chloroplast envelope’, otherwise in biological processes category was ‘chlorophyll biosynthetic process’ (Supplementary Fig. S9).In lotus, previous transcriptomic studies mainly focused on the identification of differential expression genes in specific tissues at different developmental stages.51 However, it is clear that most post-transcriptional regulation can change the product of gene expression. So, studies focusing on the level of different isoforms are also important. Based on the criterion described in M&M, the distribution of tissue-specific isoforms generated by AS was analysed in this study to uncover the potential contribution of AS in tissue specialization. Further analyses of 12 tissues revealed that the seed-coat had the most abundant tissue-specific isoforms (662 isoforms), but the elongation zone and apical meristem had none (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the distribution of tissue-specific isoforms among different tissues had similar patterns with the tissue-specific genes (Fig. 5a). On average, 97.3% of the number of tissue-specific isoforms had their corresponding genes being tissue-specific (Fig. 5b). However, in the cotyledon, the corresponding proportion was 88.5%, lower than other tissues, indicating the possible role of AS in the transcriptional diversity of cotyledon.GO analyses showed that tissue-specific isoforms are enriched in particular biological processes varying across tissues (Supplementary Fig. S9; Table S11). In the carpel, tissue-specific isoforms were highly enriched in growth and development process, such as ‘response to growth hormone’ and ‘response to karrikin’, consistent with the role of carpel in the seed growth. More importantly, the leaf-specific transcript isoforms were enriched in chlorophyll biosynthetic process and photosynthesis. In contrast, stamen-specific transcript isoforms corresponding genes were enriched in the regulation of double fertilization forming a zygote and an endosperm.To further understand the isoforms tissue-bias expression patterns, a total of 13,798 isoforms were selected for hierarchical and k-means clustering analysis having a mean FPKM >0.1 and standard deviation/mean FPKM >2 (Supplementary Fig. S10). Based on the k-means clustering analysis, filtered isoforms were assigned into 12 clusters (Supplementary Fig. S11; Table S12). The isoform levels being clustered to K1 and K8 were enriched in the cotyledon as compared with other tissues. The isoforms being clustered to K4 was enriched in the leaf and the petiole compared with other tissues, indicating strong association of isoforms in K4 to leaf and petiole. Notably, isoforms belonging to all other clusters revealed tissue-biased expression in one or two tissues other than cluster K3.3.5. Differentially expressed genes and isoforms in floral organ specificityTo identify the genes and isoforms associated with the floral development, pairwise comparison among petal, immature stamen, mature stamen, unpollinated carpel, pollinated carpel, immature receptacle, and mature receptacle was conducted. Differential expressed genes and isoforms were identified and classed into three categories: isoform differentially expressed but gene not differentially expressed (type A), both gene and isoform differentially expressed (type B), only gene differentially expressed (type C) (Supplementary Table S13). In total, there were 19,021 genes and 18,399 isoforms identified as differentially expressed (Supplementary Fig. S12). Although there were many differentially expressed isoforms, the number of type A were quite few. This indicates that regulations at isoform level and gene level are mostly correlated, except a few cases (Type A).To further understand what roles these differential expressed genes and isoforms play in floral organs, GO enrichment analysis was conducted. Between immature and mature stamens, the differential expressed genes were enriched in during floral development, such as ‘inflorescence development’, ‘positive regulation of long-day photoperiodism, flowering’, and ‘response to brassinosteroid’. Between unpollinated receptacle and pollinated receptacle, the function of type A genes was enriched during ‘suspensor development’, ‘actin filament organization’, and ‘response to abscisic acid’, indicating differential expressed transcripts, corresponding gene excluding the differential expressed, had important roles in floral development. To further validate isoforms generated by AS, the RT-PCR experiment was performed to test two isoforms, TCONS_00013274 generated form XLOC_003531 gene and TCONS_00009721 generated from XLOC_002613 gene (Fig. 6). qRT-PCR validation of differential expressed isoforms corresponding gene not differential expressed.

Based on the phylogenetic tree analysis of MADS-box gene family from the Arabidopsis and lotus, the lotus ‘ABCE’ model genes were identified (Supplementary Fig. S13). According to the heatmap of MADS-box gene family in lotus, E-class genes were all highly expressed in four floral organ samples, while C-class genes were highly expressed in the carpel (Supplementary Fig. S14). In addition, B-class genes and C-class genes were highly expressed in the stamen, whereas both A- and B-class genes were highly expressed in the petal, consistent with the Arabidopsis model. Additionally, C-class genes were highly expressed in receptacle. These observations provided important insights into the ‘ABCE’ mechanism of lotus floral organ differentiation.4. DiscussionNGS has greatly boosted the understanding of gene structure,57 transcriptional network58, and small RNAs.59 However, the limitation of sequencing length makes the assembly of full-length transcripts challenging, full-length transcript is the approved standard for gene annotation.60 In this work, we applied SMRT sequencing in the identification of full-length splice isoforms while investigating the transcriptomic variants in lotus comprehensively, thus overcoming the disadvantage of inaccuracy and difficulty in NGS assembly. The expression of full-length transcripts and loci information would greatly improve the annotation information of lotus genome and provide deep insights into lotus transcriptional landscape.In order to maximize the transcript diversity and investigate comprehensive splicing isoforms, we broadly harvested 19 samples from 12 tissues/organs. Compared with previous studies in lotus, the largest number of samples was used in our study potentially for covering the most comprehensive transcripts up-to-date. PacBio data from the combined samples might not contain sequencing depth high enough, but the sheer volume Illumina datasets partly made up for exploring low-abundance isoforms when comparing with previous SMRT transcriptomes27,30,61 studies. Sparse analysis could prove the achieved near-saturation at gene level of the final read depth.29 In this study, less than 10% of FLNCs was excavated in the >6,000 bp, indicating the ability of few lotus genes in translating too long FLNCs. Furthermore, the mechanism of fusion transcripts seldom occurred.Previous transcriptomic study on lotus revealed some novel genes compared with the existing annotation.62 However, the annotation information is poor in the existing reference genome, full-length transcriptome resource replenished reference annotation is lacking. The annotation could provide aid in the discovery of novel or previously unrecognized protein-coding genes and isoforms. Through a hybrid sequencing approach combining SMRT and Illumina data, this analysis indicates that full-length transcriptome has a great potential in improving the current lotus annotation. The 6,881 novel genes here account for more than a quarter of the reference genes number, and the number of the genes supported by SMRT data and Illumina data is almost similar. The analysis shows that the initial advantage of discovering novel genes based on Iso-Seq is reduced along with the size of the Illumina sequences getting big enough. Therefore, this hybrid strategy has made considerable trade-off between the cost and efficiency and has been applied extensively in other plants, such as sweet potato,63 barley64 and Salvia miltiorrhiza.26AS is a crucial regulatory mechanism at the post-transcriptional level, since it contributes in transcriptome and proteome diversity.5 In lotus, AS events have been identified in four Asian lotus cultivars and the finding revealed alternative 5' first exon as the predominant type of AS events, accounting for 41.2%.65 However, it is different with other plant transcriptome study in AS. This study has a comprehensive and systematic analysis of AS in lotus, based on high-quality full-length isoforms and short reads of RNA-seq datasets. Through SMRT and Illumina sequencing, we identified a mass of putative AS events covering 49.3% genes. The ratio is less than 61% reported in Arabidopsis5 and 60.5% in cotton.30 Alternative 3' splice-site events represent the largest proportion of AS and the number of genes with A3 events occupied 67.33% of all the genes undergoing AS in lotus. This kind of distribution of AS event was inconsistent with other plant studies,20,22,27 where RI is the major AS event. This research also contradicts with the findings showing the predominance of RI as a mode of AS. In contrast, the RI event was the second largest category based on lotus annotation. Further AS analysis in different tissues indicated the occurrence of A3 events in the elongation zone and apical meristem of rhizome could increase the number of A3 events in the overall AS events. However, this research cannot exclude the possibility of deeper sequencing in identifying other isoforms that update the frequency of different types of AS events. Based on the SEASs analysis,66 94.05% SEASs predominantly occurred in the rapid growing and differentiating tissue, such as seed, carpel, and stamen. This study speculates that the genes regulatory network is complex in these tissues.This study detected the functional and expressed specificity of both genes and isoforms involved in AS by predicting the annotation and expression quantity. Because the seed-coat features the largest number of tissue-specific genes and the function of these genes are enriched in development and cell wall, there is a possibility that these genes could greatly contribute to the firm structure of the lotus seed-coat which keeps the seed longevity up to a millennium. Our analysis showed that approximately one-quarter tissue-specific isoforms were associated with AS events in per tissue, highlighting AS’ important role in regulating tissue development. In addition, a small part of tissue-specific isoform generated by non-tissue-specific genes as evidenced in this study, excluding the cotyledon, which reveals the strong connection between the expression of tissue-specific isoform and tissue-specific genes. Our result showed that both the function of tissue-specific genes and isoforms were enriched in specific biological processes which vary in different tissues similar to the results reported in other plants.29,67,68 Additionally, the filtered isoforms showed a tissue-biased expression patterns based on hierarchical and k-means clustering analysis other than the tissue-specific isoforms. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the development of tissue or organ was regulated by both the expression level of genes and AS.Through differential expression analyses conducted in this study, we filtered some differential expressed isoforms, whose corresponding genes were not differentially expressed different from the previous studies. Concurrently, these isoforms were involved in the development of the corresponding tissue samples involved in the key biological process, providing further evidence of the isoforms regulatory functions. In addition, through homologous analyses with Arabidopsis, ‘ABCE’ model genes identified in MADS-box gene family in lotus, proved the compatibility of the ‘ABCE’ model for some floral organs in lotus. Moreover, the intumescent receptacle peculiar to lotus was hypothetically regulated by SHP genes and E-class genes. However, more sampling from different time points in floral organs is needed in investigating the expression of the ‘ABCE’ genes in lotus.In summary, this study improves the understanding of the transcriptional diversity in lotus by updating the existing gene models and annotations. As transcriptional diversity and complexity is unveiled by both expressional and splicing pattern, a global view of gene regulation in lotus is obtained, thus benefiting gene functional studies and molecular breeding of this economically important aquatic plant.5.

BackgroundHuman genomic variants account for ~300 Mb of sequence variation among individual human genomes and affect a variety of lengths ranging from single nucleotide to millions of base pairs,1,2 including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy-number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs). SNVs and CNVs are well known to be the causative factors in human diseases,3–5 while increasing studies demonstrates the importance of detecting SVs attributed to its pathogenicity by gene-dosage change, gene(s) disruption, gene fusion or dysregulation of disease-causing gene(s).2,6,7 In addition, recent studies show that combination of different kinds of genomic variants in each single individual results in the variability and diversity of disease phenotypes.3,8,9 Thus, it warrants an integrated platform for comprehensive detection of various genomic variants for each single case.Recently, 30-fold whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with small DNA fragments (300~500 bp) has been suggested to be the first-tier testing assay for the genetic aetiological diagnosis in paediatric cases.10 However, emerging studies have shown that at least 8.1% of those abnormalities routinely picked-up by karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) would escape detection by this standard WGS,10 letting alone those events beyond the resolutions. One of the reasons is that CNVs and SVs are predominantly mediated by repetitive elements (commonly >1 kb),11 causing the difficulty in identification of the flanking unique sequences by standard WGS.2,12,13 To overcome this challenge,14 sequencing of the junction sequences from large DNA fragments (i.e. 3~8 kb) after circularization was introduced and named mate-pair sequencing.15,16 It indicates that mate-pair sequencing with 30-fold read-depth would be an alternative strategy providing a solution to get most of the genomic variants detectable. Although there are several mate-pair methods available, limitations exist in each of them (Table 1), making clinical implementation impractical. For instance, the requirement of biotin labelling and enrichment results in high percentage of ‘inward’ sequences (read-pairs that do not cross the circularization junction)15,17,18 while random fragmentation after DNA circularization leads to a high percentage of adapter-contaminated reads (harboring adapter sequence17). Both of them would significantly reduce the read utility. Furthermore, a high chimeric rate exists leading to a high probability of false positives, while short-read methods19 report to have a failure of detection in ~9% of cases.6 In addition, gel-purification as a labourious procedure is mandatory in majority of methods (Table 1).11,20 Attributed to the ability of generating long reads, sequencing on third-generation sequencing platforms [i.e. PromethION (Oxford Nanopore Tech) and Sequel (PacBio, Illumina)] seems to be an alternative strategy.21,22 However, high cost and high sequencing error rate presented prevent its application.

Herein, we describe a gel-free and biotin-capture-free mate-pair method through coupling two Controlled Polymerization reactions by this Adapter-Ligation reaction (CP-AL). Our study further demonstrates that CP-AL significantly increases circularization efficiency, fully eliminates small-inserts and produces a narrow range of insert-size with uniform genome/exome coverage, the lowest chimeric rate and a ~50% increase of physical coverage. CP-AL was demonstrated the feasibility of being an integrated approach for detecting various genomic variants and at a fraction of current cost.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics, consent and permissionsThe study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of BGI-Shenzhen and The Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong—New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC Ref. Nos. 2016.713 and 2017.108). Six patients with infertility or recurrent miscarriages/foetal anomalies (detailed clinical indications were provided in Supplementary Material) and with karyotyping and CMA results were enrolled, while two products of conceptions (POCs) with known trisomy were also recruited. Informed consent was obtained from each participant, ~400 µl of peripheral blood was collected in an Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tube, while villus samples were collected from POCs. Genomic DNAs of NA19240 obtained from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ, USA)24 was used for method evaluation, optimization and validation. In addition, published data from (i) four balanced translocations sequenced with non-size-selected biotin-labeled blunt-end circularization (BLBEC, 3~8 kb) and (2) six cases prepared with the Nextera Mate-pair Library Construction Kit (hereafter called Nextera, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) released by the 1000 Genomes Project25 were used for comparison.2.2. DNA preparation and qualificationGenomic DNA was extracted with DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Cat No./ID: 69506, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), subsequently quantified with the Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and QC checked. An aliquot of 1 µg DNA (OD260/OD280 > 1.8; OD260/OD230 > 2) from each sample was further sheared to a fragment size ranging from 3 to 8 kb (Supplementary Fig. S1A) by HydroShear device (Digilab, Inc., Hopkinton, MA, USA) using the reported parameters.162.3. Evaluation of DNA circularization efficiencyDNA fragments (3~8 kb) were purified with Agencourt AmpureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA). After end-repair and the creation of an A-overhang, DNAs were ligated with adapter, adapter-1 (Ad1, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2, hereafter the adapter and primer sequences were provided in our previous study23). Subsequently, after annealing, to generate dsDNA with adapters incorporating dUTPs in both strands (Supplementary Fig. S3), 320 ng of ligated DNA was amplified with a pair of primers, Pfu Turbo Cx (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extra dNTPs in a 200 µl of reaction volume according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Four micrograms of PCR products were treated at 37°C for 60 min with 10 units of UDG/EndoVIII cocktail [USER; New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, USA] to create a 14 bp complementary overhang. Double-stranded circles (dsCirs) were formed with one extendable gap (Fig. 1), and linear DNA was digested by plasmid safe (Epicentre, Illumina) at 37°C for 1.5 h. For comparison, 12 replicates were circularized by our reported BLBEC16 (Supplementary Fig. S4)). Circularization efficiency was calculated as the ratio of remained DNA to the original input. Schematic representation of mate-pair library construction by coupling controlled polymerizations with a non-conventional adapter-ligation (CP-AL). The first adapter (Ad1, blue) with/without a barcode sequence (indicated by grey bar) is ligated to genomic DNA fragments (black lines). Various adapter designs may be used as the first adapter [e.g. blunt-end adapters, Y-shaped Illumina adapters, bubble adapters (Supplementary Fig. S2), etc.]. After Ad1 ligation and PCR, DNA ends are ligated together to form dsCirs containing a gap. naCNT is performed and results in DNA polymerization (dashed lines) and the movement of the gap into a selected length of the genomic DNA. 3'-branch ligation is used to ligate a 3'-end of the second adapter (Ad2_3', yellow). The two strands of the dsCir are separated, and the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with Ad2_3' at the 3'-end is used as a template for CPE (ntCPE or ttCPE). The Ad2_5' sequence (green) is added to the 3'-end of the CPE product through 3'-branch ligation. After PCR, this results in genomic DNA with half of Ad2 at each end separated by Ad1.Schematic representation of mate-pair library construction by coupling controlled polymerizations with a non-conventional adapter-ligation (CP-AL).

Evaluation of nick translation by limiting nucleotide quantitiesNick translation by PolI (DNA polymerase I) was performed in a 20 µl reaction containing 0.23 pmol dsCirs, NEBuffer 2, 10 U DNA Polymerase I (NEB) and different concentrations (10, 5 or 3.33 µM) of dNTPs (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) (Supplementary Fig. S3). The dNTP mix contained equimolar quantities of each dNTP (dATP, dTTP, dCTP and dGTP). The reaction mixture was incubated at 10°C for 20 min. The products were purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Exonucleases were used for digestion and to form linear DNA.11 Size analysis was performed for the MinElute purified Exo-treated products on 6% polyacrylamide TBE gels (Invitrogen) (Supplementary Fig. S3)).2.5. Evaluation of primer extension by limiting nucleotide quantitiesIn brief, the 3'-ends of gDNA was ligated to the 3'-end of adapter, adapter-2 (Ad2, ON5 and ON6) and subsequently denatured at 96°C, annealed with a primer (ON10) at 56°C, and extended with Taq polymerase and serial dilutions of dNTPs (33.3, 25, 20, 16.7 and 14.3 pmol) at 72°C for 10 min. Products were purified with Agencourt Axygen beads and treated with Exonuclease VII, and bead purification. Size analysis was performed on a 6% TBE gel (Supplementary Fig. S5).2.6. Comparison of different parameters in CP-AL and validationCP-AL was designed to couple nick translation and primer extension by 3'BL. For comparison, CP-ALs with different parameters (after formation of dsCir) were carried out with four DNA aliquots of NA1924024,26 from a single source for comparison. dsCir DNA prepared as described above was subjected to Controlled Nick Translation (CNT) and Controlled Primer Extension (CPE) in different conditions. (i) Polymerase and additional dATP and dTTP for nick translation: for Libraries #1, #2 and #3, 1.5 pmol of dsCirs was incubated with Polymerase I and different amounts of dNTP mix; for Library #4, 0.45 U of PolI and 0.45 U of Taq Polymerase were used instead; an equal quantity of each dNTP was added (33 pmol of each) for Library #1, whereas 33 pmol of dCTP and dGTP and 100 pmol of dATP and dTTP (3-fold of dCTP/dGTP in total) were added for each of the other three libraries. After nick translation, 3'BL was performed by mixing the products with the 3'-end of Ad2 (ON5 and ON6) in a 120 µl of reaction followed by bead purification; (ii) Primer extension: CPE by adjusting reaction temperature and time (ttCPE) was used for Libraries #1 and #2; the reaction contained the 3'BL product, Pfu Turbo Cx (Agilent Technologies) and primer ON10. The mixture was incubated at 92°C for 5 min, 56°C for 30 s and 60°C for 30 s. CPE by adjustment of nucleotide amount (naCPE) was used in Libraries #3 and #4. The reaction consisted of 3'BL products, Taq Polymerase, primer ON10 and different amounts of dNTPs. The naCPE program was 96°C for 5 min, 56°C for 1 min and 72°C for 5 min. A sample of 40 µl purified product from either ttCPE or naCPE was ligated to the 5'-end of Ad2 (ON7 and ON8) and purified with Agencourt Axygen beads. (iii) Polymerase for Ad2 amplification: Libraries #1 and #4 were amplified using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Library #2 was amplified using Pfu Turbo Cx. Library #3 was amplified using pyrophage polymerase (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA).For all four libraries, single-stranded circles (ssCirs) and DNA nanoballs (DNBs) were prepared and subjected to improved cPAL (Combinatorial Probe-Anchor Ligation) sequencing on a DNB-based sequencing platform [Complete Genomics, Inc., (CGI) Mountain View, CA, USA]. We thus obtained 28 bases (2xSE28) from the 5' ends of each adaptor, Ad1 and Ad2.262.7. Optimized CP-ALPurification of DNAs, end-repair, A-tailing, adapter-ligation, PCR amplification (Supplementary Fig. S1B), purification and dsCir DNA formation were performed for each DNA, according to the procedure described above. Of note, after purification of Ad1 PCR products, a total of 20 µg amplified DNA, which could be a mixture of each amplified DNA with equal quantity (from the six patients) or from one single sample (Trisomy 2 or 8), was used for dsCir DNA formation. naCNT was performed with 1 pmol dsCir DNA; Bst DNA Polymerase, Full Length (NEB); Klenow fragment (Enzymatics, Inc.); and limited dNTPs. 3'BL was performed to ligate the 3'-end of Ad2 to the naCNT products. Primer extension was accomplished using ttCPE as described above, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 92°C for 5 min, 56°C for 60 s and 60°C for 40 s; The sample was then purified with Agencourt AmpureXP beads. ttCPE products were ligated to the 5'-end of Ad2 and amplified with Pfu Turbo Cx (Supplementary Fig. S1C). ssCirs and DNBs were prepared for sequencing on the BGISEQ-500 platform (BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan, China).For evaluation of repeatability, CP-AL was repeated for the six subjects after Ad1 PCR experiment. For these two libraries, one was subjected for sequencing with reads of 2 × 50 bp (equivalent to paired-end 50 bp, Table 3, Supplementary Fig. S5B), while the other was for 2 × 100 bp (equivalent to paired-end 100 bp). A minimum of 70 million read-pairs was obtained for each sample for 50 and 100 bp, respectively. For the POCs, a minimum of 30-fold read-depth was generated (2 × 100 bp, Supplementary Table S3) for each case. The robustness of CP-AL was evaluated by measurement of the DNA size for (i) DNA fragments after fragmentation with HydroShear; (ii) PCR products after Ad1 PCR and (iii) after Ad2 PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Data analysis, detection of genomics variants and validationData from CGI26 were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) with a reported method27 and detection of SNVs and InDels were carried out by Trait-o-Matic.24,26 For evaluation of coverage uniformity, fraction of genome/exome/coding region was calculated as the size of region with both alleles confidently/fully called dividing by the full length (Table 2). In addition, sensitivity and specificity of SNV and InDel detection were determined by comparing the results from small-inserted libraries sequenced in the same platform.24 For the data generated from HiSeq and BGISEQ (Table 3), alignment was performed with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA).28 Physical coverage was calculated as the sum of aligned distance between each uniquely aligned read-pair not resulted from PCR duplication. The correlation of the GC (G and C nucleotides) percentage between the human reference genome and sequencing data was assessed (Fig. 2). In brief, equal number (N = 50 millions) of uniquely aligned read-pairs was randomly selected from each sample29 and merged into a dataset. Adjustable sliding windows (50 kb with 5 kb increments) and non-overlapping windows (5 kb) were determined by counting an equal number of read-pairs and the reference GC percentage of each window was calculated based on the reference genome. In each case, the GC percentage of each read-pair was calculated as the reference sequence between the aligned intervals, while GC percentage of each window was set as the median value of GC percentage from all read-pairs aligned to a particular window.

PCR was performed in the case and a well-established normal control (YH).13,30 The products were subjected to Sanger sequencing on an ABI 3730 machine (Applied Biosystems, Wilmington, DE, USA), and the results were aligned with BLAT for confirmation. Regulatory analyses such as topological associated domains and distance normalized interaction frequency were performed by the web-based 3D-genome Interaction Viewer and Database (http://www.kobic.kr/3div/).31 For the data from POCs, SNVs identification was carried out with Genome Analysis Toolkit HaplotypeCaller (version 3.4), and calculation of allelic ratio in chromosome-wide and genome-wide was described in the Supplementary Material.3. Results3.1. Establishment of a new mate-pair library method: CP-ALFor clinical labs to conduct large-scale tests, an inexpensive and scalable mate-pair sequencing process is crucial. Herein, we described a new mate-pair library construction workflow through coupling two controlled polymerizations by 3'BL, which was demonstrated with higher process efficiency, lower cost and better uniformity of genome/exome coverage in following study. In the new schema (Fig. 1, steps with estimated turn-around-time were described in Supplementary Table S2), gDNA was first fragmented into the size of interest, ligated to adapter-1 (Ad1, Supplementary Fig. S2) and circularized to form double-stranded circles (dsCirs). To improve the efficiency of DNA circle formation, 14 bp overhangs were used. It resulted in median 12% circularization efficiency in 16 replicates compared with ~3% from 12 replicates from BLBEC protocol32 (Supplementary Fig. S4), a 4-fold efficiency (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: P < 0.0001),The Ad1 dsCirs contained a gap that acted as the initiation site for a controlled polymerization CNT. Subsequently, the 3'-end of adapter-2 (Ad2, Ad2_3') was directly added to the 3'OH termini of duplex DNA containing gaps using 3'BL.23 After ligation, another controlled polymerization CPE was performed on the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template. This enzymatic target enrichment strategy can efficiently eliminate the ‘inward’ read-pairs that occur with the biotin capture method (Table 1). In CPE, a primer was hybridized to Ad2_3' and extended onto the genomic template on the other side of Ad1. The 5'-end of Ad2 (Ad2_5') was then added through another 3'BL to the newly synthesized CPE template (Fig. 1). Each template of the mate-pair has a selected length (an example of a minimal length of 150 bp shown in Supplementary Fig. S6), resulting from CNT and CPE reactions, respectively and is separated by the Ad1 sequence with Ad2_5' and 3' sequences at either end. The ligation products were amplified using Ad2_5' and Ad2_3' primers resulting in a linear dsDNA library or a ssCir DNA library that can be sequenced by various technologies such as sequencing by synthesis on the Illumina,33 Ion Torrent34 or BGI's cPAS35 platforms or sequencing by ligation using the SOLiD36 or first-generation CGI26 platforms (Supplementary Fig. S7).3.2. Feasibility testing of CP techniques for CP-AL schemaAs shown previously, polymerization speed strongly depends on polymerase Km and concentration, incubation time and temperature.11 Here we tested another hypothesis of controlling DNA extension by limiting nucleotide amount. We first used dsCirs with two gaps flanking the adapter on opposite strands as templates to assay nick translation extension (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Three different amounts of dNTPs (2.6, 4.0 and 8.0 pmol) were supplied in the PolI-mediated CNT reactions, which resulted in different observed extension lengths (24, 30 and 62 bp) (Supplementary Fig. S3B), suggesting that nick translation can be controlled by nucleotide quantity. We calculated a predicted polymerization length per arm based on the ratio of total dNTPs to the number of naCNT initiation sites (Supplementary Fig. S3C). For PolI-mediated reactions, observed extension lengths (24, 30 and 62 bp) were close to the predicted lengths (23, 35 and 70 bp; Supplementary Fig. S3B and C). It appears that PolI can utilize most, if not all, of the dNTPs in the nucleotide amount CNT (naCNT) reactions. Based on this observation, if we normalize the dsCir quantity to 1 pmol in the CP-AL schema, 100 pmol of total dNTPs will be needed in naCNT for an extension of ~100 bp. We also found that naCNT products contain gaps of a few bp, since the 3' exonuclease activity of PolI can cleave a few nucleotides from the nicks in a 5' to 3' direction (data not shown).To replace the complicated biotin capture method for targets enrichment, we tried to use CPE to recover products of interest. We hypothesize that, as for CNT reactions, there are two ways to control primer extension length—by limiting the nucleotide amount (naCPE) or by managing the reaction time and temperature (ttCPE). We first assessed whether limiting dNTPs could control DNA extension length (Supplementary Fig. S5). The naCPE template was 0.16 pmol of a 700~3,000 bp gDNA fraction with 3'-ends ligated to an adapter sequence. Supplementary Figure S5B demonstrates that different naCPE reactions generated different sizes of primer-extended products (Lanes 1–5 in Supplementary Fig. S5), and the size correlates with the dNTP amount. Excess dNTPs (5,000 pmol, Lane 6) generated products of the original size range (700~3,000 bp). Reactions performed with the lowest quantity of dNTPs (14.3 pmol, Lane 5 in Supplementary Fig. S5) generating the smallest products (210~300 bp). For ttCPE, the same amounts of CP-AL intermediate products after naCNT and 3'BL were extended for different times in the presence of excess dNTPs. An extension of 300~450 bp was observed after a combination of 56°C for one min and 60°C for 40 s with Pfu Turbo Cx. After CPE, a partially duplex DNA with a 3' recessive end is produced. 3'BL can efficiently add adapters to gapped or 3'-recessed duplex DNA.23 Therefore, both naCNT and CPE products are perfect templates for 3'BL.3.3. Comparison of different parameters in CP-AL and validationWe next compared different combinations of CP conditions and assayed the sequencing quality of the CP-AL libraries using a well-characterized sample NA19240, variants from which were reported.24,26 To minimize the GC bias in naCNT, two approaches were used (Table 2). First, more than one polymerase, such as a combination of PolI with Taq Pol, was included to process through most, if not all, polymerase-specific pausing sites to minimize bias. Second, dATP and dTTP were provided in 2-fold excess relative to dCTP and dGTP (3xAT in total), given a higher percentage of A/T compared with C/G in the human reference genome.Four libraries with different CP conditions were constructed and sequenced at a read-depth of 50~60-fold (Table 2). Library #1 prepared with equal amounts of four dNTPs during naCNT demonstrated the highest fraction (6.6%) of autosomal exome at <60% of the mean coverage, the lowest percentage (95.0%) of genome coverage with both alleles detected and the lowest sensitivity of SNV (95.2%) and InDel (80.7%) identification (Supplementary Table S3)24 compared with the other three libraries. It indicated that additional A/T provided during naCNT could improve the coverage uniformity. Compared with the data from small-insert libraries, with additional A/T provided, it resulted in detecting SNVs with sensitivity and specificity up to 97.3 and 99.7%, respectively, while it provided the sensitivity and specificity at 84.6 and 90.6%, respectively in InDels detection (Supplementary Table S3). No significant difference of genome/exome coverage was observed between Libraries #3 and #4, indicating no particular effect of using a combination of polymerases in naCNT. In addition, similar percentages of genome/exome coverage were observed for Library #2 (ttCPE) and Libraries #3 and #4 (naCPE), suggesting that ttCPE and naCPE were interchangeable. However, as it is difficult to precisely quantify the branched templates after naCPE and 3'BL, ttCPE was adopted. Taken together, we incorporated naCNT with 3xAT and ttCPE into CP-AL.3.4. Validation of CP-AL for detection of CNVs and SVsOne important application of mate-pair sequencing is CNVs and SVs detection. In this study, first, six samples (five with insertion translocations and one with normal karyotype, Table 3) were used for replicated CP-AL (1 µg input for fragmentation with end-products ranging from 3 to 8 kb) and sequenced for a minimum of 70 million read-pairs in 100 and 50 bp, respectively. Among these six subjects, Sample02 is a male subject diagnosed with oligo-atheno-terato-spermia, while the other five subjects have a history of recurrent miscarriages or foetal anomalies (Supplementary Material). Consistent with the performance during optimization stage as described above, GC bias was minimal indicated by the significantly high concordance (r > 0.98) between the GC percentage in each window calculated by human reference genome and that of the aligned reads (Fig. 2).To evaluate the performance of CP-AL compared with the data generated from the most similar conditions (such as non-size-selection and 3~8 kb initial fragment size), WGS data from four samples, which were with non-size-selected BLBEC libraries and sequenced for ~50 million read-pairs (50 bp) on HiSeq 2000 platform16 were used for comparison. First, we compared the data utility when with the same number of read-pairs (N = 50 million). Approximately 91.5% of the ‘inward’ read-pairs in the data with BLBEC were aligned to a distance <1 kb (Supplementary Fig. S8), while, based on the schema design, CP-AL would not generate such read-pairs (with inconsistent aligned orientations, Fig. 1). Here, we compared the percentages of read-pairs with an aligned distance <1 kb. The results showed that CP-AL produced only ~0.7% of read-pairs with an aligned distance <1 kb, compared with the ~27.5% observed with BLBEC and ~24.4% with Nextera (Table 3, Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. S9). Approximately 33% lower physical coverage was observed using BLBEC compared with CP-AL (Fig. 2H), indicating a much higher utility of sequencing data using CP-AL. Of note, although DNA input was reduced from 3 to 1 µg in CP-AL, a similar duplication rate was observed in samples with CP-AL compared with those with BLBEC (Table 3). The reduction of PCR duplication might be owing to the increased circularization efficiency, providing more DNA templates for further experiment. In addition, to evaluate performance using shorter reads such as the data generated using EcoP15I, the read-pairs from each sample were trimmed into 26 bp in length and subjected to the analysis under the same parameters. Although no significant difference of the fraction of genome covered physically was seen between the two methods when read-depth as 50 bp, the coverage was 4% higher with CP-AL compared with BLBEC when with the 26 bp reads (Table 3); this increased covered fraction can be attributed primarily to the higher data utility obtained from CP-AL.Next we evaluated the ability of CP-AL in SVs detection with different read-lengths (100, 50 and 26 bp). Compared with the results identified with 100 bp sequencing, which fine-mapped a total number of 26 rearrangements in these five insertion translocations, the diagnostic yields of data with 50 and 26 bp (trimmed from 50 bp) were only 92.3% (24/26) and 84.6% (22/26), respectively (Fig. 3A). It indicates that the longer read-length attained could enable a more comprehensive detection of structural rearrangements. Of note, in these five insertions the incidence of complex insertion translocations was 80.0% (4/5) (Fig. 3B and C, Table 3). Further, the importance of fine-mapping breakpoints can be evidenced by the potential genetic diagnosis of the patients. In Sample02, data from both 50 and 26 bp failed to identify the rearrangement in chromosome 6q13 between coordinate 74,138,669 and 74,343,934, the latter breakpoint is disrupting gene SLC17A5 (Fig. 4A). Although compound heterozygous mutations have been found in SLC17A5 causing Salla disease (OMIM: #604322), no direct evidence was proved for the contribution of its heterozygous loss to spermatogenesis. However, gene EEF1A1, whose super enhancer was found to be highly correlated with SLC17A5 (both genes located in the same topological domain, Fig. 4B),31 was likely haploinsufficient and might be essential for spermatogenesis.37 It indicated that dysregulation of EEF1A1 caused by disruption of SLC17A5 would be the potential pathogenicity. In addition, it is also supported by the observation of disrupting 33.3% (5/15) cross-cell-type correlations between distal DNA I Hypersensitive sites and promoters of EEF1A1 (Supplementary Fig. S10).38 However, no sample type such as RNA is available from this subject for further investigation.

Black arrow and green indicate the super enhancer of gene EEF1A1 and the gene itself, respectively.Apart from the observation of improved diagnostic yield made by the analysis with longer read-length, another advantage is to provide more uniquely aligned read-pairs in supporting rearrangement event attributed to the increased specificity of alignment with longer read-length/sequence. This was evidenced by the observation of a 33.1% reduction (from 25.1 to 16.8) of the average number of supported read-pairs for each rearrangement event in the data with 26 bp trimmed from 50 bp.To evaluate the performance of CNV detection by CP-AL, we compared the results with CMA (Supplementary Fig. S11). Consistent with our previous findings, CP-AL not only reported all 6 rare CNVs detected by CMA, but also additionally identified 11 rare CNVs (U-test P < 0.0001)29 including 9 deletions and 2 duplications. All of these additional CNVs were owing to the lack of probes within the targeted regions in CMA, but all of which were classified as benign or likely benign in public databases (such as ClinVar). Both assays defined a likely pathogenic deletion involving gene ZIC1 in Sample05 (Supplementary Fig. S12), which was involved in the breakpoint of this complex rearrangement, indicated by the supporting read-pairs (Fig. 3C). Overall, our study showed a high consistency of CNV detection between CP-AL and CMA in these six cases.3.5. Establishment of a single assay for identification of various genomic variantsTo address the possibility of identifying SNV, CNVs and SVs in one single assay, we further carried out CP-AL with >30-fold read-depth WGS for two POCs (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S13). Detection of SNVs, CNVs and SVs were performed independently and integrated afterwards. In case Trisomy 2, the increased allelic ratio (Supplementary Material) in chromosome 2 confirmed that there was one copy gain of whole chromosome 2 consistently with the result from CNV analysis, while SV analysis provides the information of the duplication/deletions supporting read-pairs (Fig. 5) for narrow-downing the critical affected regions (Supplementary Fig. S14). Of note, the breakpoints of these deletions/duplications were predicted to locate in the regions fully with repetitive elements and segmental duplications (Supplementary Fig. S14), which was unlikely detectable by standard WGS. The feasibility of detecting the same genomic variants by different analyses demonstrated an accurate detection, emphasizing the advantage of integration of all detection results. A similar finding was observed in case Trisomy 8 (Supplementary Fig. S13), demonstrating the robustness of this application. In addition, in case Trisomy 2, a 51.4 kb inversion was detected in chromosome 6q14.1, while a 187.9 kb inversion was observed in chromosome Xq28. Consistent with the findings of deletions/duplications, the breakpoints of both inversions were also predicted to locate in the regions densely populated with repetitive elements and segmental duplications (Supplementary Fig. S14). Overall, the analysis from these two samples emphasizes the advantages and superiorities of applying CP-AL with 30-fold WGS as an integrated method for potentially comprehensive study of genomic variants in human diseases, compared with standard WGS.

DiscussionMate-pair sequencing provides a foundation for identifying various genomic variants, including SNVs, CNVs and SVs in one single assay, however, problems such as low data utility and high cost limit the clinical application of current methods (Table 1).11,15 In this study, we developed a new mate-pair method CP-AL through coupling controlled polymerizations with a non-conventional adapter-ligation reaction recently developed in our previous study,23 and further demonstrated that its feasibility and advantages in detection and delineation of various genomic variants in human diseases.In this study, based on the foundations provided by 3'BL reaction, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of controlling polymerizations during nick translation and primer extension and coupling these two reactions by 3'BL. Before building up the whole workflow, we demonstrated the feasibility of carrying out each key component, respectively: (i) conducting nick translation by adjusting the dNTP quantities (naCNT) instead of adjusting reaction temperature and duration time, the latter commonly results in a large size range of templates;11 (ii) performing primer extension by either adjusting the dNTP amount (naCPE) or adjusting reaction temperature and duration time (ttCPE). Further, during optimization, a more uniform genome/exome coverage was achieved by providing a 2-fold excess of dATPs/dTTPs in nick translation: the percentage of autosomal exome with <60% of mean coverage was improved from 6.6 to 0.7%, whereas percentages of coding regions with both alleles detected in a well-characterized sample NA19240 were increased from 95.9 to 98.1% (Table 2).Compared with the reported approaches,6,11,15,16,39,40 CP-AL provides the following advantages: (i) an adapter with a 14 bp overhang is used increasing circularization efficiency (from ~3 to ~12% by 4-fold), thus decreasing the minimal DNA input amount; (ii) no gel-purification; (iii) biotin-capture-free fully eliminates the ‘inward-sequences’ (0.7%, or a 39.3-fold reduction from 27.5% for BLBEC; 24.4% for Nextera); (iv) secondary-fragmentation-free avoids the random presence of ‘adapter-contaminated’ (~23% from Nextera) due to random fragmentation after DNA circularization; (v) sequencing with different read-lengths and different platforms demonstrates a more uniform genome/exome coverage attributed by minimal GC biases;41 and (vi) generation of a long read-length (100 bp or even longer) with the lowest chimeric rate provides the potential foundation for disease precision diagnosis and disease-causing gene discovery. It was evidenced by the observation of an 18.2% increased detection rate for SVs (4/22, four additional events detected from 22 detected with 26 bp), one of which potentially causes a positional effect for male infertility. In evaluation of the performances other than the consistency of variants detection,16 it is important to have the same DNAs as input, however, no such material was available from the previous study for CP-AL experiments. Given the targeted performances were only related to the critical DNA fragment size instead of the certain mutations/variants pattern in a particular case and a consistent fragment size of the DNA input after fragmentation (Supplementary Fig. S1A), our study is able to support the argument of CP-AL is superior to the existing mate-pair method in these related applications.In addition, our data further suggests that good performance of SNV and InDel detection in CP-AL (Supplementary Table S3). Together, CP-AL with WGS has been proved to be the most integrated assay in providing the detection results of point mutations (SNVs), deletions/duplications (CNVs), translocations, inversions and insertions (SVs). In addition, we further demonstrated its advantages by showing the higher detection accuracy attributed by detecting the same variants by different types of analysing methods (Fig. 5). For example, increased allelic ratio from SNV detection confirmed the copy-number gain while SV analysis provided the read-pairs supporting the deletions/duplications (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S13). Since the breakpoints of those SVs identified by CP-AL are predicted to locate in the genomic regions densely populated with repetitive elements and segmental duplications, which are unlikely detectable by standard WGS, our study shows the potential of replacing standard WGS by CP-AL.Apart from high read-depth application, we also show the feasibility of using CP-AL with low-pass (or low-coverage) WGS for CNV and SV detection application, given that an ~50% increased physical coverage obtained from CP-AL. In this aim, only a limited number of read-pairs (50–70 million) is required in each sample; a pooling step is suitable.16 In addition, due to the flexibility of sequencing orientation for ssDNA, pooling was performed soon after Ad1 PCR (Fig. 1). This change will reduce the labour cost for all subsequent procedures by treating the pooled library as a single sample. By modification of the adapter sequence, our study also shows the potential of wider applications in different sequencing platforms (Supplementary Fig. S6). For the cost aspect, avoiding the usage of expensive reagents such as biotin and exonuclease (exonuclease digestion and/or streptavidin beads is costly and inefficient), the reagent cost of CP-AL is only a fraction of current cost, for instance: it is only approximately one-tenth of BLBEC (US $40 vs $350, Table 1).15 It is important that reduction of mate-pair library cost can be achieved, given the era of 1,000 USD for standard WGS came, CP-AL would overcome the main challenges in detecting various genomic variants but with similar cost.Moreover, the biologic interpretation of the genomic variants is important after identification. Five cases with insertion translocations known to result in abnormal embryos/pregnancies with high risk (Supplementary Fig. S15) were studied in this study. CP-AL with 100 bp was able to detect and delineate all the rearrangements, providing a much higher incidence of complex insertion translocations as 80.0% (4/5) (Fig. 3B and C) compared with the previous study.42 The importance of fine-mapping the related breakpoints was demonstrated in providing the potential foundation for disease precision diagnosis and disease-causing gene discovery, such as showing a potential positional effect in a patient with oligo-atheno-terato-spermia (Sample02, Fig. 4). In addition, in Sample05 with cryptic deletion (not detected by karyotyping) involving OMIM disease-causing gene ZIC1 likely haploinsufficient (HI = 2) defined by ClinGen Genome Dosage Map. No clinical recognized malformation was identified in this patient. It might be due to incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity or the potential pathogenicity of this gene was contributed by gain of function instead,43 warranting a comprehensive clinical assessment.Although reduction of both labour work and reagent cost makes CP-AL more practical for routine practice, several limitations remain: (i) PCR amplification with primers incorporating dUTPs is used, which would be inefficient for DNA >10 kb. Foreseeing that CP-AL with limited ability in identification of SVs mediated by low-copy repeat, application of third-generation sequencing platforms21,22 might be an alternative strategy; (ii) Read-length: given that improvement of variants detection and delineation were observed by longer read-length attributed to the improvement of alignment specificity (Fig. 3A), it is valuable to provide longer read-depth (>150 or 300 bp, Supplementary Fig. S6) for CP-AL; and (iii) DNA samples were fragmented physically (HydroShear); alternative methods such as fragmentation by Transposases (i.e. Tn5)44 is warranted.In conclusion, we provide a cost-effective and high-efficiency mate-pair method CP-AL that offers higher utility of read-pairs, better uniformity of genome/exome coverage at a fraction of current cost. With 30-fold read-depth, this approach shows promise as an integrated method and eligible first-tier WGS testing assay for detection and delineation of various genomic variants in human diseases.AvailabilityWhole-genome sequencing data used in this study have been made available in the CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive (CNSA: https://db.cngb.org/cnsa) under the accession number CNP0000078.We would like to acknowledge the ongoing contributions and support of all Complete Genomics and BGI-Shenzhen employees, in particular the many highly skilled individuals that work in the libraries, reagents and sequencing groups that make it possible to generate high-quality whole-genome data.

IntroductionThe Mollicutes class represents a taxonomic group of bacteria that has undergone an extreme genome downsizing process termed degenerative evolution.1 As a consequence of this evolutionary process, these bacteria are characterized by the lack of a cell wall, streamlined genomes and very limited biosynthetic pathways. All these features have turned Mollicutes, and particularly some species encompassed within the Mycoplasma genus, into appealing models to study basic principles of complex cellular processes, such as transcription and translation. For instance, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important model organism for Systems Biology as highlighted by the comprehensive knowledge acquired about its complete genome,2 transcriptome,3 proteome,4 DNA methylome5 and gene essentiality.6 In addition, the first whole-cell computational model developed was for Mycoplasma genitalium.7 At the same time, Mycoplasmas are also interesting organisms for the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and to study the minimal set of genes required to sustain life.6,8–10 Indeed, the genome of the first synthetic bacterium, JCVI Syn3.0, was inferred from the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides following a top-down approach in a design-build and test cycle.11 Aside from their relevance as model organisms, Mycoplasmas are also a serious concern for the medical and veterinary fields given their pathogenic effects on a wide variety of species. For instance, M. pneumoniae is a human pathogen that causes atypical pneumonia,7,12,Mycoplasma gallisepticum causes pneumonia in poultry13 and Mycoplasma agalactiae causes contagious agalactia, a common disease in small ruminants with a tremendous economic impact.14Identifying genes involved in pathogenicity is critical for generating new vaccines and therapies. Genes that are dispensable for in vitro growth (i.e. non-essential, NE) but essential (E) for the infection process could be target genes for vaccine design. Construction of essentiality maps is a fast way to decipher the essential or non-essential character of every single gene found in the genome of a given bacterium. Furthermore, these maps can also help in the identification of those genes that are not essential but whose disruption affects the fitness of the bacteria in a particular environment (i.e. fitness, F). The generation of these maps relies on the construction of saturating libraries of transposon mutants, followed by high-throughput insertion tracking by ultra sequencing (HITS) at different passages.6,15 Furthermore, construction of saturating libraries is also relevant for Haystack mutagenesis,16 a technique useful to establish gene–function relationships that is widely employed in Mycoplasmas, as a consequence of the paucity of other genome editing tools for these bacteria.17Tn4001 is a gentamicin, tobramycin and kanamycin resistance-conferring transposon that was originally found in Staphylococcus aureus,18 but has been widely employed in Mycoplasmas.6,10,19 Few modifications have been made to this transposon to adapt it for use in Mycoplasmas aside from (i), placing the transposase coding gene outside the inverted repeats (in plasmids termed mini-transposons) to prevent re-excision from the transposon after the first transposition event,20 and (ii) replacing the original gentamicin resistance marker by tetracycline,18 chloramphenicol21 or puromycin22 resistance genes. Such a poor adaptation of the Tn4001 transposon to Mycoplasmas might partially explain the dramatic differences observed among transformation efficiencies (TEs) in species from this genus. For example, TE is consistently higher in those species belonging to the pneumoniae cluster (i.e. species closely related to M. pneumoniae)23 than in those species encompassed in the spiroplasma24 or hominis clusters.25Here, we explored and identified the reasons underlying the lower transposon TE in a set of different Mycoplasma species that differ in their phylogenetic distance to M. pneumoniae. We hypothesized that poor recognition of certain gene regulatory regions (RRs) in the transposon vector might limit TE in some species. Therefore, we rationally engineered a vector variant that significantly increased the TE in all species tested except for M. pneumoniae, which was already transformed at high efficiencies with the unmodified vector. These species were selected to encompass the three different clusters described in the Mycoplasma phylogenetic tree, thereby opening up the door to more global studies of Mycoplasma species. Furthermore, a reporter assay allowed us to identify which of the RRs determining expression of the antibiotic resistance and transposase protein coding genes found in the native transposon vector were inefficiently recognized in each of the strains selected for this work. Finally, to show the potential of our transposon vector, we performed an essentiality study of M. agalactiae, obtaining an insertional coverage similar to the one reported for M. pneumoniae.62. Materials and methods2.1. Bacteria strains and culture conditionsFor wild-type M. pneumoniae, the strain M129 (ATTC 29342, subtype 1, broth passage no. 35) was used. Wild-type M. agalactiae 7784 was kindly provided by Christine Citti. Wild-type M. gallisepticum R high was kindly provided by Michael Szostak.25 Wild-type Mycoplasma feriruminatoris G5847 was kindly provided by Carole Lartigue.26 All strains were grown at 37°C in standard Hayflick medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and phenol red (0.005% w/v). M. agalactiae standard Hayflick culture was supplemented with sodium pyruvate (0.5%, pH 7.6, Sigma-Aldrich). M. feriruminatoris, M. agalactiae and M. gallisepticum were grown in suspension (180 rpm, 37°C). M. pneumoniae was grown without shaking at 37°C and with 5% CO2.2.2. PlasmidsThe plasmids were generated following the Gibson assembly method.27 The list of plasmids as well as a detailed description of the procedure followed to build all the constructs are described in Supplementary Table S1. For plasmid generation, DNA was isolated from NEB® 5-alpha High Efficiency (C2987P). The clones were isolated using LB agar + ampicillin (100 µg/ml) plates and confirmed by sequencing (GATC biotech). The list of all the primers used in this study for the generation of the plasmids can be found in Supplementary Table S2.2.3. Transformation protocolTransformation procedures were initially based on methods previously described but later slightly modified.24 For M. feriruminatoris, M. agalactiae and M. gallisepticum cultures, 10-ml log-phase cultures were harvested at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The medium was removed and 10 ml of fresh Hayflick was added. After 3 h, the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C and then washed three times with chilled electroporation buffer (EB; 272 mM sucrose, 8 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) before final resuspension in 300 µl chilled EB. After mixing 50 µl of cells with 1.5 µg of DNA and incubating for 20 min on ice, the mix was transferred into 0.1-cm electro cuvettes and electroporated in a BIO-RAD Gene Pulser Xcell apparatus. For M. pneumoniae (i.e. adherent strain) cells were grown in a 75-cm2 tissue flask containing 20 ml of fresh Hayflick and incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 until late exponential phase. Cells were washed twice, resuspended in precooled EB, scraped off and passed through a 25-gauge (G25) syringe needle 10 times. Aliquots of 50 µl of cells in 0.1-cm cuvettes with 1.5 µg of the corresponding plasmid were kept on ice during 20 min. The electroporation settings were common for all strains: 1250 V/25 µF/100 <U+2126>. Immediately after the pulse, 420 µl of fresh Hayflick was added to the cells. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 37°C before seeding on agar plates. The incubation time was 30 min for M. feriruminatoris, 90 min for M. agalactiae and M. gallisepticum and 120 min for M. pneumoniae.2.4. Determination of transformation efficiency in Mycoplasma speciesAfter incubating the transformations at 37°C during the above-mentioned time depending on the strain, 10-fold serial dilutions of the cultures were performed (from -1 to -8). The dilutions were made in a total volume of 100 µl and 10 µl of each dilution was plated onto Hayflick 0.8% agar plates. Transformations done with pMTnGm or pMTnGm-SynMyco vectors were counted on agar plates supplemented with 100 µg/ml gentamicin. Transformations done with pMTnCm vector were selected in agar plates supplemented with 20 µg/ml chloramphenicol. The mutant counts refer to mutants per transformation, where the final volume is 500 µl. TE is defined as the ratio of colony forming units (CFUs) counted on antibiotic supplemented plates (i.e. transformed cells carrying a transposon insertion) to non-supplemented plates (i.e. viable cells after transformation). To assess differences in TE between pMTnGm and pMTnCm, one-tailed paired t-tests were applied to three different experimental replicates for each strain employed in the study. As the mutants obtained for M. agalactiae, M. gallisepticum and M. feriruminatoris using pMTnCm transposon were below the limit of detection, for the statistical analysis, the number of mutants obtained was set to 49 CFU per batch, a value that corresponds to the maximum number of CFU under the limit of detection for each species. The P-values obtained for TE differences between pMTnGm and pMTnCm were 0.470, 0.186, 0.026 and 0.067 for M. feriruminatoris, M. agalactiae, M. gallisepticum and M. pneumoniae, respectively (for the raw data of these transformations as well as the statistical analysis, see Supplementary Table S3). The same statistical approach was applied to compare TE obtained with pMTnGm versus pMTnGm-SynMyco in three different experimental replicates for each species employed in the study (P-values of 1.49 × 10-4, 4.28 × 10-2, 4.97 × 10-2 and 0.325 for M. feriruminatoris, M. agalactiae, M. gallisepticum and M. pneumoniae, respectively). Data of TEs obtained with pMTnGm and pMTnGm-SynMyco as well as the statistical analysis are shown in Supplementary Table S4.2.5. Phylogenetic analysis of selected Mycoplasma speciesFor the generation of the phylogenetic tree, 21 Mycoplasma species were selected. DNA sequences encoding the 16S rRNA of each species were aligned using multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW. For those species containing more than a single copy coding for the 16S rRNA, we selected one of the copies arbitrarily. The evolutionary history of these microorganisms was inferred using the neighbour-joining method.28 The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.91 is shown. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 iterations) are shown next to the branches. The evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method29,30 and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. Codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + non-coding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1,464 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X.31 The 21 different DNA sequences coding for 16S rRNA and the accession number of the species to which they belong are listed in Supplementary Table S5, except for M. feriruminatoris whose assembled genome sequence was kindly provided by Dr Carole Lartigue.2.6. Ribosome-binding site inclusion along different Mycoplasma speciesAs a reference we used the same set of 21 Mycoplasma species that were used to build up the phylogenetic tree. Specifically, for each species we extracted the 15 bases before the start codon of all their annotated genes. Within these sequences, we then checked for the presence of any of the subsequences reported to be RBS.32 This list included: GGA, GAG, AGG, AGGA, GGAG, GAGG, AGGAG, GGAGG, AGAAGG, AGCAGG, AGGAGG, AGTAGG, AGGCGG, AGGGGG and AGGTGG. Inclusion was represented as the percentage of genes in a bacterial species that included one of these RBS motifs (for the percentage of RBS inclusion of the species of the work, see Supplementary Table S6).2.7. Strength evaluation of native regulatory regions driving the expression of the transposase and gentamicin resistance gene in pMTnGm, and comparison with SynMyco regulatory region in different Mycoplasma speciesThree different reporter plasmids containing the mCherry coding sequence under the control of the three different RRs (i.e. pMTnGm-SynMyco+SynMyco RR-Venus+SynMyco RR-mCherry, pMTnGm-SynMyco+SynMyco RR-Venus+GmR-mCherry and pMTnGm-SynMyco+SynMyco RR-Venus+Tnp RR-mCherry) were generated. These plasmids contain genes coding for two fluorescent proteins (i.e. Venus and mCherry). These proteins have fused in its N-terminal part the mp-200 sequence, a 29 amino acid signal from M. pneumoniae MPN391a gene that has been previously fused to Venus and mCherry sequences to improve protein stability.33 Whereas the gene coding for the Venus fluorescent protein was included for normalization purposes in all constructs under the control of SynMyco RR, the gene coding for mCherry has been placed under the control of three different RRs depending on the construct: (i) the SynMyco RR, (ii) the 150 bp upstream region of the transposase coding gene (Tnp RR) and (iii) the 150 upstream region of the gentamicin resistance coding gene (Gm RR).All constructs were transformed in M. agalactiae, M. gallisepticum, M. feriruminatoris and M. pneumoniae following the protocol described above. To generate a primary stock of the transformations, from each 500 µl batch 100 µl was inoculated in a flask containing 5 ml of Hayflick medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml gentamicin for M. pneumoniae, while for the other non-adherent strains the 100 µl was inoculated in 50 ml Falcon tubes (Fisher Scientific, 14-432-22) filled with 10 ml of Hayflick medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml gentamicin. When cultures were grown, the total biomass was resuspended in 1 ml of Hayflick medium and stored at -80°C.To determine the fluorescence levels of each construct, cultures of the four different Mycoplasma strains carrying the three different reporter constructs plus a negative control for each strain not carrying any construct were used. The cultures were grown as described above using 10 µl of their respective primary stocks as inoculum (i.e. around 12 h for M. feriruminatoris, 48 h for M. gallisepticum and M. agalactiae and 72 h for M. pneumoniae) and cells were harvested and washed twice with chilled PBS buffer until final resuspension of the cultures in 500 µl of PBS. Five-fold serial dilutions of the final cell suspensions were done, and 100 µl of all dilutions were loaded in 96-Well Optical Btm Plt Polymerbase Black Lid plates (165305, Thermo Scientific).The absorbance and fluorescence values were measured using Tecan I-control 1.9.17.0 Infinite 200. The settings were determined for optimal gain, 25 flashes and 20 µs of integration time. The fluorescence settings were <U+019B>ex = 514 nm and <U+019B>em = 574 nm for Venus and <U+019B>ex = 550 nm and <U+019B>em = 630 nm for mCherry. For each strain, the absorbance at <U+019B> = 600 nm was measured. For the fluorescence analysis we took the data of those wells (i.e. dilutions) in which OD600nm absorbance values were between 0.075–0.2; 0.2–0.35; 0.075–0.4 and 0.22–0.66 for M. feriruminatoris, M. agalactiae, M. pneumoniae and M. gallisepticum, respectively. These dilutions were selected so that fluorescent signals were clearly different from negative controls of each strain (i.e. not carrying fluorescent constructs) and proportional to the absorbance (i.e. not saturating signals). Fluorescence arbitrary units (AU) measured for Venus and mCherry were normalized to OD600nm for each condition (Venus AU/OD600 and mCherry AU/OD600) to obtain normalized fluorescence AU. For each of the four strains of the work, the mCherry and Venus fluorescence levels of WT cells (i.e. not carrying any fluorescent construct) were determined and subtracted from the fluorescence values obtained for each condition, to obtain subtracted AU. Finally, to compare the strength of all RRs analysed we calculated for each strain the ratio between normalized and subtracted mCherry UA/normalized and subtracted Venus UA. Statistical paired t-test analysis with one-tailed distribution was performed for each strain comparing the ratio of mCherry AU/Venus AU for (i) SynMyco-mCherry versus Gm RR-mCherry and (ii) SynMyco-mCherry versus Tnp RR-mCherry. For the data of the strength evaluation of SynMyco RR and the native RR driving the expression of the gentamicin and the transposase coding genes in the native pMTnGm as well as the statistical analysis, see Supplementary Table S7.2.8. M. agalactiae pMTnGm-SynMyco transformation for essentiality studyM. agalactiae was transformed using the pMTnGm-SynMyco transposon following the protocol described above. Two hours after the transformation, <U+2158> parts of the total 500 µl batch were inoculated into 10 ml Hayflick + 0.5% sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich P8574-5G) + 100 µg/ml gentamicin. After 24 h at 37°C, the culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were collected in 500 µl of Hayflick constituting passage 1 of the transformation. The procedure described above was repeated two more times until passage 3, using a volume of 8 µl of the immediately preceding passage, to grow all the passages (1/62.5 dilution). Taking into account the doubling time of M. agalactiae (4–5 h), and the passages performed the expected number of cell divisions in passage 3 is 20. From passage 3, 350 µl out of the total 500 µl were taken to extract genomic DNA using the MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (MC85200, Lucigen) following the protocol described by the manufacturer.2.9. Genome assembly and de novo annotation for M. agalactiae 7784M. agalactiae was grown 48 h in 25 ml of Hayflick medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate at 37°C as described previously. After, the genomic DNA was isolated using the MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (MC85200, Lucigen) following the protocol described by the manufacturer. The genomic DNA was sheared to 200–300 bp fragments using a Covaris S2 device. Then, paired-end Illumina libraries were created following previously described protocols34 and the size selected was 125 bp. The resulting libraries were quantified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer chip (Agilent Technologies). Double-stranded templates were amplified and sequenced on an Illumina GAII. Raw reads were analysed using the FastQC tool (website: http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) for assessing the quality and the presence of adapters. Contigs were de novo assembled using ABySS35 and M. agalactiae 5632 genome as annotation reference resulting in 159 contigs with average length of 5,511 bp. In total, 503 genes present in M. agalactiae 5632 displayed homologs within contigs of M. agalactiae 7784. We increased this value up to 689 with a specific BlastN search where we restrictively selected hits with an alignment length greater than 95% and an e-value less than 1 × 10-5. This allowed us to provide a more accurate list of genes presented by the strain of interest to assign putative functions by homology as well as to detect gene duplications in the studied genome. We observed that 12 contigs were informative enough to capture a set of 689 genes. This set of contigs averaged 71,163 bp each in length and 853,960 bp in total. The latter value was considered to be the genome size for M. agalactiae 7784. The raw data of DNAseq, genome assembly and de novo annotation have been submitted as BioProject under accession PRJNA528179.2.10. Sequencing of M. agalactiae 7784 transformed with pMTnGm-SynMycoGenomic DNA sequencing was performed in the Genomics facility at Centre for Genomic Regulation in a HiSeq Sequencing v4 Chemistry controlled by Software HiSeq Control Software 2.2.58. Sequencing settings were fixed at 125 nucleotides in paired-end format. In the HiSeq sequencing technology from Illumina Genome Analyzer, the protocol starts with DNA fragmentation. Then, the fragmented DNA is amplified using oligos that add adapters allowing the subsequent binding of PCR products to the glass flow cell. Later, the sequencing is performed by synthesis cycles, in which a single complementary base for each deoxynucleotide (dNTP) is incorporated using a fluorescently labeled dNTP. Finally, lasers excite the fluorophores while a camera captures images of the flow cell.2.11. Transposon mappingFor M. agalactiae 7784, paired-end sequencing raw reads were filtered to remove PCR duplicates using Fastuniq.36 Then, a specific inverted repeat (IR) associated to the transposon insertion process (TTTTACACAATTATACGGACTTTATC, length = 26) was trimmed by Trimmomatic37 and then mapped to the reference using Bowtie2 allowing 1 mismatch.38 Later, we selected paired reads mapped unambiguously with a minimum alignment quality of 30 using SAMtools.39 The last step relied on shell text processing tools (awk/grep/sed) to identify those pairs where one of the reads presented a shorter length than the original read length minus 26 (expected length if the IR was removed). Position reported represents the first mapped position in the chromosome contiguous to the IR.2.12. Essentiality definition and training set generation for M. agalactiae and M. pneumoniaeAfter Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) were associated to the M. agalactiae genome using eggNOG-mapper40 utilizing the DIAMOND mapping mode, taxonomic scope set on Firmicutes and prioritizing quality over coverage. A subsequent step of manual curation of COG categories was performed. For the set of 689 genes found for M. agalactiae 7784, the genes included in the training list, the COG category assignment, their essentiality assigned class and the statistical analysis, see Supplementary Table S8.3. Results and discussion3.1. Transformation efficiencies in Mycoplasmas show dramatic differences depending on the strainAs a starting point of the project, we aimed to quantify the transposon TE in representative members of each cluster of the Mycoplasma genus (Fig. 1A). To this end, cultures of M. feriruminatoris (spiroplasma cluster), M. agalactiae (hominis cluster), M. pneumoniae and M. gallisepticum (pneumoniae cluster) were transformed with the pMTnGm vector,23 a mini-transposon plasmid derived from the original Tn4001 that confers resistance to gentamicin and is broadly employed in the Mycoplasma field. As expected from previous reports, M. pneumoniae showed the highest TE, with approximately one transformant for every 103 cells. M. pneumoniae was followed by M. gallisepticum and M. agalactiae, with three transformants for every 106 cells. Far behind these TEs was that of M. feriruminatoris, for which we found one transformant for every 109 cells (Fig. 1B). Screening of transposon TEs across the mycoplasmal landscape.

One-tailed t-test P-values are indicated with one asterisk (*) when P < 0.05 for TE obtained with pMTnGm vector compared to the TE obtained with pMTnCm vector. Since the expression of the gentamicin resistance gene has been found to exert a detrimental effect on growth in M. genitalium even in the absence of gentamicin itself,23 we wanted to determine whether this effect was exacerbated in M. gallisepticum, M. agalactiae and M. feriruminatoris. This could be responsible for the low TE observed in these species with the pMTnGm vector. To this end, we repeated the same set of transformations, but this time with a modified version of pMTnGm vector termed pMTnCm. In this vector, the native gentamicin resistance gene as well as its RR were replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance under the control of the p438 RR, a minimal 22-bp sequence that controls the expression of a putative restriction enzyme in M. genitalium.For the sake of clarity, from this point on, we will refer to the sequence immediately upstream of the translational start codon of each gene as the RR, comprising the promoter region involved in transcription as well as the 5' UTR involved in translation.We found that the number of M. pneumoniae transformants obtained with the pMTnCm vector was more than three times higher than the number obtained with the pMTnGm vector, thus falling in line with the previous reports of toxicity associated with expression of the gentamicin resistance gene.23 On the other hand, the TE was dramatically lower in all the other species tested, with the number of total transformants falling under our detection limit of 50 CFU per batch for M. gallisepticum, M. feriruminatoris and M. agalactiae (Fig. 1C). The most plausible explanation for these results is that only M. pneumoniae is able to efficiently recognize both the RR found upstream of the gentamicin resistance gene and the M. genitalium-derived p438 sequence driving the expression of the chloramphenicol resistance gene. In contrast, it seems that M. gallisepticum, M. feriruminatoris and M. agalactiae can recognize the RR controlling the gentamicin resistance gene but not the one controlling the chloramphenicol resistance gene.These results suggest that TE might be directly related to the ability of the transcriptional/translational machinery of each strain to efficiently recognize the RRs controlling not only the antibiotic resistance gene, but also the transposase coding gene.3.2. Design of an efficient regulatory region for a broad range of Mycoplasma speciesSeveral aspects might influence the TE of a transposon vector and can be classified into two different categories. In the first category, we can include those factors that affect the TE of any vector, such as degradation of the plasmid by bacterial restriction machinery, or the optimality of the transformation protocol itself. Leaving these aside, there is a second group of factors that are specific for transposon vectors. Thus, once the vector has entered the cell, proper transcription/translation of the transposase coding gene is required for the correct insertion of the antibiotic resistance gene into the chromosome. Second, the insertion mutant would only be able to grow if the protein levels of the antibiotic resistance gene reach a certain threshold that is sufficient to promote growth on selective medium. Therefore, in an attempt to maximize the protein levels of both the transposase coding gene and the antibiotic resistance gene in all Mycoplasma species, we decided to design a RR termed SynMyco Regulatory Region (SynMyco RR) that would allow efficient transcription and translation in different mycoplasma species.As a reference for the design, we chose the RR of MPN665, a gene whose transcript is in the top 5% of most transcribed genes in the transcriptome of M. pneumoniae.41 Also, its protein levels (2,646 copies per cell) are among the highest in the proteome of M. pneumoniae.4 MPN665 encodes for the elongation factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu) protein. As a main component of the ribosome, the protein product of this gene has an essential role in translation and is universally conserved in the prokaryotic world.42,43 Thus, with the aim of identifying important elements, we aligned the RRs of MPN665 orthologues found in a representative set of Mycoplasma species (Fig. 2A). For the design of the SynMyco RR, we mainly kept those bases found in the MPN665 RR that are not changed to another base in other species. However, given that native RRs did not evolve to be the most productive transcriptional drivers, we also favoured those bases that were found to be optimal as transcription/translation determinants in a recent screen of synthetic sequences.44 This is exemplified by including an extended Pribnow box motif (TGN-Pribnow) within the SynMyco RR, a feature that is not found in any of the native EF-Tu RRs analysed but promotes higher transcription rates. Based on the screen mentioned above, we also changed the Pribnow box sequence from TAAAAT to the canonical TATAAT motif. Lastly, to ensure the functionality of the SynMyco RR in a broad range of Mycoplasma species, we paid special attention to other features found in the RRs such as the -35 box or the Shine-Dalgarno region (also known as, Ribosome Binding Site, RBS). In particular, the -35 box seems to have lost its prevalent role as a transcriptional driver during Mycoplasma evolution, as indicated by the absence of any consensus sequence among the most productive RRs found in the screen of synthetic sequences.44 In fact, only a degenerated -35 box with the sequence TTGANN can be found in the RRs of just 20% of the genes of M. pneumoniae.45 However, as the most prevalent sequence found at the -35 area of the EF-Tu RRs analysed was TGC, we included this in the SynMyco RR. On the other hand, the Shine-Dalgarno region, which is responsible for ribosome docking onto the mRNA, is present in only 26% of M. pneumoniae genes. In contrast, in other species such as M. agalactiae, it is found in as much as 73% of the coding sequences (Fig. 2B). For this reason, we also included a Shine-Dalgarno region in the design of the SynMyco RR, using the sequence that is most frequently found in the EF-Tu RRs analysed (i.e. 5'-AAAGGA-3'). The complete sequence of the SynMyco RR with its main sequence determinants indicated is shown in Fig. 2C. Analysis of RRs found in Mycoplasma species. (A) Sequence alignment of the EF-Tu RRs of 10 selected Mycoplasma species. Four main domains are highlighted in boxes: the -35 box, Pribnow box, the RBS sequence and the Translation Starting Codon.

A transposon vector carrying the SynMyco regulatory region dramatically increases transformation efficiencyTaking the widely employed pMTnGm vector as reference (Fig. 3A), we constructed a new transposon vector termed pMTnGm-SynMyco in which both the transposase and the gentamicin resistance coding genes were placed under the control of the SynMyco RR (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, we used this vector to determine whether TE is higher with pMTnGm-SynMyco than with pMTnGm. To this end, cultures of M. pneumoniae, M. agalactiae, M. gallisepticum, and M. feriruminatoris were transformed in parallel with both vectors.

The fold change in TE is indicated in arrows connecting both sides of each panel. One-tailed t-test p-values are indicated with one asterisk (*) when P < 0.05 for TE obtained with pMTnGm-SynMyco vector compared to the TE obtained with pMTnGm vector. Similar bar plots are shown in (D) for M. gallisepticum, (E) for M. feriruminatoris and (F) for M. agalactiae.We did not find significant differences in TE for M. pneumoniae when transformed with either of the two vectors (Fig 3C), which is not surprising taking into consideration that M. pneumoniae already showed a high TE with the pMTnGm vector. Therefore, these data suggest that the expression levels obtained with the RRs of the pMTnGm vector were already enough to saturate the system in this strain.On the other hand, the TEs obtained with the pMTnGm-SynMyco vector were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in all other species when compared with the TEs obtained with the pMTnGm vector. In particular, for M. gallisepticum, we observed a 30-fold increase in TE, obtaining more than 106 mutants when transformed with pMTnGm-SynMyco (Fig. 3D).For M. feriruminatoris, the strain showing the worst TE with pMTnGm (less than 100 total transformed cells per replicate), we observed a 980-fold increase in TE when transformed with pMTnGm-SynMyco, resulting in more than 90,000 individual clones carrying a transposon insertion (Fig. 3E).Lastly, for M. agalactiae, we found that whereas with the pMTnGm vector we usually observed slightly more than 200 transformed cells per replicate, we obtained more than 3 × 105 insertion mutants when transformed with pMTnGm-SynMyco, a value that represents an increase in TE of more than 1036 times (Fig. 3F).Thus, when transforming these Mycoplasmas strains with the pMTnGm vector, we can classify them into three different groups according to their TEs. The first group is the high efficiency group and contains M. pneumoniae, which showed a TE of 10-3. This is followed by the intermediate TE group (i.e. 10-5–10-6) composed of M. agalactiae and M. gallisepticum, and finally by the low TE group (i.e. 10-9) with M. feriruminatoris as the representative. In contrast, when transforming with the pMTnGm-SynMyco vector, we are only able to distinguish a high TE group (composed of M. pneumoniae, M. agalactiae and M. gallisepticum) and an intermediate TE group, (M. feriruminatoris alone).It should be noted that although TE is consistently increased in M. gallisepticum, M. feriruminatoris and M. agalactiae when transformed with pMTnGm-SynMyco vector, the actual numbers of total mutants obtained might be further increased carefully by optimizing the transformation protocol for each species, something that we have not addressed in this study. In addition, while we have generated only a gentamicin version of the SynMyco transposon, we hypothesized that the other resistance markers available for Mycoplasmas (i.e. chloramphenicol, puromycin and tetracycline)18 and already implemented in native Tn4001 transposon-derived vectors, might in the future be included in pMTnGm-SynMyco vector in substitution of the gentamicin resistance gene. This would allow the generation of a set of four different transposon vectors highly efficient in a broad range of Mycoplasmas. Furthermore, as was recently shown for M. genitalium, resistance genes can also be flanked by lox sites in vectors carrying the SynMyco RR thereby allowing the recycling of antibiotic markers when employing protocols that require the iterative use of transposon insertion mutagenesis.463.4. Strength comparison of SynMyco regulatory region and those in the native pMTnGm vectorIn all species tested, the number of transformed cells was higher when transformed with pMTnGm-SynMyco vector than with unmodified pMTnGm vector. These results suggested that the protein yields of the transposase and/or the protein conferring resistance to gentamicin were major determinants of the TE. In order to find out which of the two gene products, or both, were responsible for the increase in TE, we developed a reporter assay. This reporter assay allows quantification of the relative strength of SynMyco RR compared with the RRs driving the expression of the transposase (i.e. Tnp RR) and the gentamicin resistance gene (i.e. Gm RR) in the native pMTnGm vector. To this end, we created three different vectors derived from the pMTnGm-SynMyco in which the genes coding for the mCherry and Venus fluorescent proteins were introduced for quantification and normalization purposes, respectively. The region controlling the expression levels of the mCherry protein varies between the three different vectors, being either SynMyco RR, Tnp RR or Gm RR, whereas the RR controlling the expression of Venus reporter is constant in all the constructs, being always SynMyco RR (Fig. 4A). The three different constructs were transformed in all of the species studied in this work. Subsequently, the ratio between mCherry fluorescence and Venus fluorescence allowed us to determine the relative strength of each RR in M. pneumoniae (Fig. 4B), M. gallisepticum (Fig. 4C), M. feriruminatoris (Fig. 4D) and M. agalactiae (Fig. 4E). Comparison of the SynMyco RR efficiency versus the native regulatory regions of pMTnGm transposon. (A) Scheme of the key modules of (i) pMTnGm-SynMyco+SynMyco RR-Venus+SynMycoRR-mCherry transposon, (ii) pMTnGm-SynMyco+SynMycoRR-Venus+Gm RR-mCherry transposon and (iii) pMTnGm-SynMyco+SynMyco-Venus+TnpRR-mCherry transposon. The abbreviations that appear in the figure are: Tnp for transposase coding gene, Amp for ampicillin resistance coding gene, IR for inverted repeats, ColE1 ori for ColE1 origin of replication, GmR for gentamicin resistance coding gene, Venus for Venus protein coding gene and mCherry as mCherry protein coding gene.

On top of each bar is represented the average ratio of mCherry/Venus fluorescence obtained for each of the constructs in three replicates. One-tailed t-test p-values are indicated with one asterisk (*) when P < 0.05 for the ratio of mCherry/Venus under the control of SynMyco RR versus either Gm RR or Tnp RR.

The abbreviations that appear in the figure are: Tnp for transposase coding gene, Amp for ampicillin resistance coding gene, IR for inverted repeats, ColE1 ori for ColE1 origin of replication, GmR for gentamicin resistance coding gene, Venus for Venus protein coding gene and mCherry as mCherry protein coding gene. (B) Bar plot representing the ratio obtained in M. pneumoniae  for mCherry/Venus fluorescence using transposons represented in panel A. While Venus reporter is always under control of SynMyco RR, the mCherry gene is controlled by SynMyco RR in the left bar, Gm RR in the central bar and Tnp RR in the right bar. On top of each bar is represented the average ratio of mCherry/Venus fluorescence obtained for each of the constructs in three replicates. One-tailed t-test p-values are indicated with one asterisk (*) when P < 0.05 for the ratio of mCherry/Venus under the control of SynMyco RR versus either Gm RR or Tnp RR. Similar bar plots are shown in (C) for M. gallisepticum, (D) for M. feriruminatoris and (E) for M. agalactiae.In all species, the ratio between mCherry and Venus fluorescence is close to 1 (i.e. 0.9 for M. pneumoniae, 1.1 for M. gallisepticum, 1.1 for M. feriruminatoris and 1.3 for M. agalactiae) when both reporters were under control of the SynMyco RR. Interestingly, in M. gallisepticum and M. feriruminatoris, the ratio is also close to 1 when mCherry is under control of Gm RR (i.e. 1 for M. gallisepticum and 1.1 for M. feriruminatoris) but drastically drops when the expression of mCherry is driven by Tnp RR (i.e. 0.2 for M. gallisepticum and 0.03 for M. feriruminatoris). Altogether, these data suggest that in these two species, when transforming with pMTnGm or pMTnGm-SynMyco vectors, the difference in TE would be due to the expression level of the transposase gene and not the antibiotic resistance gene.Poor performance of Tnp RR was also observed in M. pneumoniae and M. agalactiae as indicated by the low fluorescence ratio observed when mCherry is under control of Tnp RR (i.e. 0.1 for M. pneumoniae and 0.1 for M. agalactiae). Moreover, in contrast to M. gallisepticum and M. feriruminatoris where Gm RR and SynMyco RR provide similar protein yields, in M. pneumoniae and M. agalactiae the fluorescence ratio is also reduced when the expression of mCherry is driven by Gm RR (i.e. 0.1 for M. pneumoniae and 0.2 for M. agalactiae). Thus, in M. pneumoniae and M. agalactiae, SynMyco RR outperforms not only Tnp RR but also GmRR in terms of protein yields.It has not escaped our notice that the reporter assay shows the same expression profile for M. agalactiae and M. pneumoniae, whereas TE upon using pMTnGm-SynMyco is only drastically increased in M. agalactiae (i.e. 1036-fold change) but not in M. pneumoniae (i.e. 1.1-fold change). We hypothesized that this observation might be related with the different doubling times of the species. Slow dividing species, such as M. pneumoniae, would have more time to deliver the transposon cargo into the chromosome before cell duplication starts to dilute the plasmid within the growing population. In contrast, in species dividing faster, such as M. agalactiae, a quick transposition into the chromosome mediated by high expression levels of the transposase coding gene would represent an advantage to avoid the dilution effect associated with cell division and thus would lead to an increased TE. An alternative or complementary hypothesis is that M. pneumoniae might be somehow more permissive than the other species for the presence of extrachromosomal elements inside the cell. In this scenario, a fast transposition into the chromosome mediated by high expression levels of the transposase coding gene would represent a greater advantage for the other mycoplasma strains than for M. pneumoniae.In summary, our reporter assay shows that SynMyco RR is efficiently recognized in all the species tested, and suggests that the factor limiting the TE with native pMTnGm vector in most Mycoplasma species is the expression of the transposase coding gene.3.5. Unblocking the global study of essential and dispensable genes in M. agalactiaeTo the best of our knowledge, studies regarding essentiality in Mycoplasmas have only been published so far for M. genitalium,8,M. pneumoniae,6,Mycoplasma pulmonis,47,Mycoplasma bovis10 or Mesoplasma florum.48 However, while for M. pneumoniae almost 350,000 unique transposon insertion mutants have been tracked, the other studies analysed a substantially lower number of clones. For instance, the M. bovis study only obtained 319 mutants, representing one insertion every 3,145 bp of the total genome,10 and the study in M. genitalium analysed around 3,300 mutants, showing an insertional coverage of one disruption over every 175 bp.8 Obviously, the accuracy of the assignment of genes to each one of the three categories of essentiality [i.e. essential (E), non-essential (NE) and fitness (F)] is directly related to the insertional coverage of the transposon mutagenesis. Moreover, the existence in bacteria of small open reading frame-encoded polypeptides (i.e. short open reading frame-encoded proteins, also known as SEPs) as short as 11 amino acids in length is becoming widely accepted.49 Thus, high transposon TE is necessary to study the essentiality of these SEPs.6,50To illustrate the potential that our pMTnGm-SynMyco vector could have in the study of a broad range of Mycoplasma species, we decided to perform an essentiality study for M. agalactiae 7784, a strain for which no essentiality map is currently available. First, we sequenced, assembled and annotated for the first time the genome of this strain. Then, after transforming the strain with pMTnGm-SynMyco vector we were able to map 199,723 transposon insertions to the M. agalactiae genome, with an estimated genome size of 853,960. This represents ~23.3 insertions over every 100 bp, which is around half of the coverage observed in M. pneumoniae6 (354,447 transposon insertions mapped, representing ~43 insertions over every 100 bp) but still substantially higher than the ones reported in other essentiality studies (Fig. 5A and B).

The asterisk represents P-value < 0.05 (3.62 e-41 and 1.20 e-20) when comparing density of insertions of E and NE coding genes in M. pneumoniae and M. agalactiae respectively.When considering the frequency of insertions per gene, we observed a bimodal distribution separating essential from non-essential genes in both strains (Fig. 5C). Next, we explored the insertional profile at the gene level using sets of known E and NE genes as inferred from the reference essentiality study in M. pneumoniae.6 Whereas for M. pneumoniae the training sets for E and NE genes comprise 27 and 28 genes, respectively, for M. agalactiae we generated dedicated training sets based on bibliography containing 32 E genes and 17 NE genes. When comparing the average density of insertions between E and NE genes in M. pneumoniae and M. agalactiae, we observed that the two groups were significantly different within each species (two-tailed t-test with equal variances, P-values equal to 1.42e-47 and 1.05e-20, respectively; Fig. 5D). Taken altogether, we were able to assign one category for 689 genes found in the M. agalactiae 7784 genome: E (43.98% of genes), F (25.25% of genes) or NE (30.77% of genes) (see Supplementary Table S8), in line with the percentage of E (49.28%), F (13.40%) and NE (37.32%) genes obtained for M. pneumoniae.6When M. agalactiae essential genes were classified according to the COGs functional categories annotation system, we found that the categories that were significantly enriched in essential genes were: (i) protein coding genes involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, (ii) functional RNAs, (iii) protein coding genes without assigned COG category and (iv) protein coding genes with unknown function (see Supplementary Table S8).However, for the purpose of this work it is more relevant to compare the essentiality map of M. agalactiae at high density of insertions with one obtained with low density to illustrate the importance of high coverage. Unfortunately, there is no essentiality study done in M. agalactiae, but there is a low coverage analysis in its closely related specie M. bovis PG4510 (319 transposon insertional mutants individually sequenced, versus more than 199,000 transposon insertions analysed by deep sequencing in our study). Sequencing of individual insertion clones is useful to classify the genes within the F-NE categories (i.e. genes disrupted by a transposon insertion) but cannot distinguish between both. Examples of this limitation are the genes coding for a tRNA modification GTPase and for the deoxyribonuclease IV. In the M. bovis essentiality study, both genes (i.e. MBOVPG45_0060 and MBOVPG45_0301) were classified as NE given the isolation of individual clones carrying insertions within their coding region. However, our essentiality study based on the analysis of at least 600 times more mutants than the one of M. bovis and mapped by ultra sequencing classified these two genes (i.e. MAGA7784_RS00280 and MAGA7784_RS02715) as F in M. agalactiae. This implies that although these genes are non-essential, their disruption cause a growth impairment of these particular clones at least for M. agalactiae, something that cannot be directly measured by genomic sequencing of transposon insertion in a limited number of clones.Moreover, aside from its lack of accuracy in distinguishing between NE and F genes, the main limitation of small transposon libraries is related with E genes. Specifically, the low coverage of these libraries makes it difficult to ascertain whether a gene is free of insertions because of its essential character or as a result of the randomness of the integration and/or low sampling of the mutants. Indeed, only two genes were suggested by the authors as highly probable essential genes in the M. bovis study, MBOVPG45_0337 and MBOVPG45_0710, coding for an ATP-binding protein and SGNH/GDSL hydrolase, respectively. This assumption was based on the lack of clones carrying a transposon insertion within the coding regions of these genes in spite of their large size (i.e. 3420 bp for MBOVPG45_0337 and 8013 bp for MBOVPG45_0710). Nonetheless, it should be noted that the insertional coverage of the mutant library of this study, with one insertion every 3145 bp of the genome on average, is in the same range of these genes in terms of size. In our M. agalactiae essentiality study, the orthologue of the SGNH/GDSL hydrolase coding gene (i.e. MAGA7784_RS03410) was found E, confirming the hypothesis of the M. bovis report. In contrast, the gene coding for the ATP-binding protein (i.e. MAGA7784_RS02615) was determined as NE as indicated by the presence of 891 transposon insertions within its sequence. This suggests that the absence of clones carrying an insertion within MBOVPG45_0337 gene is most likely a consequence of the low coverage of the insertional library, rather than the gene being truly essential in M. bovis. Furthermore, the limitation of low coverage libraries to assign a truly E character for a given gene is even more evident with small coding sequences. For instance, in M. bovis there were no clones found to carry a transposon insertion within the coding sequences of genes MBOVPG45_0043 (582 bp) or MBOVPG45_0596 (963 bp), coding for sigma-70 RNA polymerase factor and Holliday junction branch migration DNA helicase ruvB, respectively. This might indicate that these genes are E. However, homologues of these genes are fully covered with transposon insertions not only in M. agalactiae (MAGA7784_RS00215 and MAGA7784_RS01205), but also in M. pneumoniae (MPN626 and MPN536), suggesting the lack of insertions in the M. bovis study is more likely related with the small size of the genes rather than with their essential character. All of these examples illustrate the importance of high coverage transposon insertion libraries for the appropriate category assignment of a given gene, something that can be only achieved with efficient transposon vectors such as pMTnGm-SynMyco.In conclusion, we demonstrate that the RRs driving the expression of the transposase and the resistance genes have a tremendous impact on the TE achieved after vector transformation. Although problems derived from poor recognition of vector RRs can be avoided with transformation procedures based on purified transposases,51 it should be noted that not all transposases are commercially available and their cost might limit use in many research groups. Indeed, screening libraries of RRs for the key elements of transposon vectors has already been shown to be a useful strategy to produce a moderate increase (i.e. around one order of magnitude) in the TE of different bacteria.52 However, an approach such as the one followed in our study involving rational design of RRs rather than the screen of a limited number of variants might be more effective in increasing TE. In fact, we have seen that the pMTnGm-SynMyco vector significantly increases the TE in three phylogenetically distant Mycoplasma species. For this reason, we hypothesize that this vector might improve the reported TE in all species belonging to the Mycoplasma genus. Even though we have shown that the SynMyco RR is efficiently recognized in different species, it cannot be excluded that other designs of RRs could also lead to an increase in TE. As exemplified in this work with M. agalactiae, the higher TE obtained using this vector may unblock the development of new essentiality maps for other Mycoplasma species, and thereby promote global knowledge of these interesting microorganisms. In addition, the higher insertional coverage obtained with the pMTnGm-SynMyco vector should facilitate the isolation of clones of interest from libraries of insertional mutants, an advancement which may boost gene-function assignments in Mycoplasma species that have been poorly studied so far.We thank Dr Sarah A.

IntroductionMutations in DNA are responsible for various inherited disorders and cancer, but they are also crucial for evolution. Here we focus on elastic properties of DNA sequences with hereditary mutations, which can be obtained from parents (from a mother via oocyte or from a father through sperm) or they arise de novo (during formation of parent’s germ cells or post-zygotically).1,2 Mutations can be induced by environmental factors, but they also arise spontaneously: (i) due to deamination of the methylated cytosine (mC),3,4 (ii) during DNA replication.5 With a fully functional repair system, the frequency of spontaneous error is ca 1 per 109–1010 base pairs per replication.6 Mutations are not equally distributed along the DNA sequence.7,8 Sites that possess higher mutation frequency than would be expected by chance are considered as hotspots, while sequences with lower frequencies than would be expected by chance are coldspots. The CpG dinucleotide is a well-known hotspot where mC converts to thymine resulting in TpG (or CpA on the other strand) transitions.9 Hypermutability of CpG reflects spontaneous methylation of cytosine, which is a common post-replicative modification of DNA in both bacteria and eukaryotes.10 These errors are recognized by thymine DNA glycosylases within the base excision repair (BER) pathway where the glycosylic bond between the thymine base and the ribose is cleaved, which triggers downstream events of the BER.10,11 Despite the effective repair, this mutation is very frequent.12–14 As a result, CpG sites occur less frequently in the genome, than would be expected by chance.15,16 Except for CpG dinucleotide, CpHpG motif (where H stands for A, C or T) was also detected as a hotspot.17 Another example is GTAAGT sequence, which is mainly associated with insertion/deletion errors.18 It was observed that a sequence of ±2 nucleotides (nt) around a mismatch affects relative rates of single nucleotide variations and that mismatches are not repaired with the same efficiency,19–21 which highlights the importance of both the mismatch type and the neighbouring nucleotide sequence. Mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops are targeted by MutS protein (homologue of eukaryotic MutSa) within mismatch repair (MMR). Two subunits (MSH2 and MSH6) form human MutSa,6 which moves along DNA and searches for mismatches.22,23 Mismatch detection is coupled with conformational changes of the subunits that create a transient clamp around DNA.24 When the MutSa identifies a mismatch, it provokes ATP binding that induces a sliding clamp with high stability. MutL protein is then recruited, which initiates the repair process.25 The clamp relaxation is associated with ATP hydrolysis, thus the MutSa switches between open/closed states.26 Crystallographic structures of MutS/DNA (or MutSa/DNA) complexes revealed that DNA with a mismatch is bent by ca 60°.27–30 A model where MutSa slides along DNA and scans for flexible regions corresponding to mismatches has been proposed.22 The mismatch is further recognized by phenylalanine 432 and glutamine 434 from conserved Phe-X-Glu motif in MutSa. The phenylalanine intercalates into minor groove and stacks onto mismatched base while the glutamine creates a hydrogen bond with it.30Molecular dynamics (MDs) is a computational method that can describe the behaviour of molecules at the atomic level on nanosecond (ns) to microsecond (µs) time scale. Although this method utilizes simplified potential energy functions and fixed atomic charges it has provided valuable information about DNA flexibility.31–34 Bending of DNA with different mismatches (in the absence of protein) was analysed by Sharma et al.35 where a biased MD method (umbrella sampling) was used because DNA cannot bend spontaneously to the conformation observed in the complex with MutS protein. Analysis of mismatches in one sequence context revealed different bending free energies which partially correlated with the binding affinities of MutS to the mismatches. The umbrella sampling method was also used in the study of bending of various B-DNA sequences (AT, GC and A-tract sequences) containing G/T, G/A and C/C mismatches and abasic sites.36,37 Structural analysis of DNA mismatches in three different sequence environments was also carried using unrestrained MD simulations.38 The study showed to which extent different mismatches induce alterations of the local structure and which base pair arrangements are most populated. The relation between DNA mutability and flexibility was however not reported so far.In our previous study,39 we analysed the presence of germline mutations (obtained from the Human Gene Mutation Database—HGMD, http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php) in the 5-nt DNA segments repeatedly occurring in five genes (PAH, LDLR, CFTR, F8 and F9) associated with common inherited disorders. This approach contrasts with the conventional strategy because hotspots are usually derived from a mutation spectrum. The occurrence of mutations in the mutation spectrum, however, often reflects particular population where an effect of a common ancestor plays a role (founder effect), i.e. frequent mutation originate from a single mutation event and is spread throughout the population as observed in our40 and other studies.41,42 We detected statistically significant coldspots and hotspots and determined characteristic sequence patterns for each group, particularly, coldspots contained purine tract while hotspots showed alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence often with the presence of CpG dinucleotide. In the next step, we employed an adaptive biasing force (ABF) MD method43 to better understand the relation between DNA-bending properties and DNA mutability. In particular, we analysed the global bending properties of two coldspots and two hotspots with a G/T pair and derived the free energy required to bend a straight DNA duplex towards the geometry found in the complex with MutSa protein. We observed that the coldspots are inherently more flexible than the hotspots.In this study, we extended analysed dataset and derived bending free energies for 10 coldspots and ten hotspots with different mismatches. Primary attention was paid to G/T and A+/C mismatches which are results of transitions occurring more frequently than transversions.44 In addition, G/T and A+/C base pair geometries are near-isosteric to canonical pairs. We also analysed other mismatches (A/A, G/G, A/G, C/T, C/C and T/T), but for the symmetrical G/G, A/A and C/C mismatches, we did not get stable base pairs during bending. Moreover, we carried out a bending analysis of 10 Czech population hotspots and 15 de novo mutations with G/T and A+/C pairs. The computations are complemented by experimental melting curves measured for eight coldspots and eight hotspots with G/T mismatch.2. Materials and methods2.1. The building of DNA 15-mers with mismatchesThe 15-nt long DNA duplexes with central mismatch pair were built as a right-handed B-DNA by the nab module of AMBER 14.45 Terminal 5-nt segments (underlined) were identical for all systems, only the central 5-nt region varied according to the analysed motif, i.e. forward sequence was 5’GAACC XXXXX CTAGG3’, the reverse sequence was 5’CCTAG XXXXX GGTTC3’, the position of the mismatch is in bold. To maintain consistency during bending analysis when we analysed purine/pyrimidine mismatches, the purine base and the surrounding ±2 nt sequence was always put into the forward sequence. Our tests showed that the placement into the reverse strand has negligible impact on the resulting bending free energy. DNA was then solvated with TIP3P water molecules46 in a truncated octahedral periodic box and neutralized with sodium ions47 using the tleap module of AMBER, a new version of DNA force field parmbsc148 was used. Similarly to the study,35 DNA mismatched base pairs (G/T, A/C, A/G, G/A, C/T, T/C, C/C, T/T and A/A) were built in anti-anti form which is prevailing geometry.38,Figure 1 shows all analysed mismatch geometries, indicated C1’–C1’ distances for A-T and G = C pairs were taken from the previous study49 while C1’–C1’ distances of mismatched base pairs are average values calculated from 150 ns production simulations described below. In the anti-anti form, both bases have glycosidic bonds in anti-conformation and mutually interact through Watson-Crick (WC) edge (there are three edges: WC, Hoogsteen (H) and Sugar, through which base can interact with another base). The G/G mismatch was built in anti-syn geometry where the glycosidic bond of one guanine is rotated about 180° and adopts a syn conformation (Fig. 1), which is considered to be a more stable arrangement.50,51 In the anti-syn G/G mismatch, first base interacts through WC edge, whereas the second one through H edge. Further, A/C and C/C pairs were built protonated. Protonated forms of adenine at N1 and cytosine at N3 positions were taken from the AMBER library. The protonated pairs represent stable arrangements where each pair consists of two H-bonds (Fig. 1). The previous study35 has shown that protonated A+/C pair is the relevant state for DNA bending.Base pair geometries: (A) Canonical WC base pairs A-T and G = C.

Equilibration and production dynamicsThe systems were equilibrated in three steps. First, a minimization of the system was performed in 3,000 steps, then the system was heated to 300 K during 100 ps at a constant volume and finally, a 500 ps long simulation was run at 300 K and 100 kPa at the NPT conditions. Then we ran production dynamics for 150 ns at the NPT conditions. During both equilibration and production dynamics, terminal base pairs were restrained by distance restraints imposed on hydrogen bonds to avoid a formation of flanking bases that could perturb the DNA structure. The built models contained mismatched bases mutually oriented with WC edges close to the optimal base pair arrangement (visualized in Fig. 1). During the minimization/equilibration procedure the mismatched pair spontaneously adopted the optimal arrangement in the nearest energy minimum (see below where minima are described). Formed mismatches were stable during 150 ns production dynamics. Similarly, we prepared the G/G pair in the anti-syn form using xleap module of AMBER; the first guanine was oriented with WC edge and the second one with H edge.2.3. ABF calculationsWe used the ABF method43 to calculate free energies during DNA bending and employed the Multiple Walkers Approach (MWA)52 to accelerate the calculations. All the ABF simulations were performed in the modified PMEMD programme from AMBER, connected with PMFLib.53 The length of each ABF simulation was 200 ns (40 ns for each MWA client). Convergence of these 200 ns simulations was tested in our previous study.39 The collective variable used in the free energy calculations was the mass-weighted root-mean-square distance (RMSD) to a target structure calculated over all of the heavy atoms from terminal 5-nt long segments and the heavy atoms of the backbone from the central 5-nt long segment corresponding to the AMBER mask notation ((: 1–5, 11–20, 26–30) | (:6–10, 21–25@P, OP1, OP2, O3', O5', C3', C4', C5')) & (!@H=). The target structure used in the calculations was bent X-ray DNA duplex from the complex with MutSa protein (PDB ID 2O8B)30 (Fig. 2A).(A) Superimposed bent X-ray DNA structure (from PDB ID 2O8B) (green) and relaxed MD structure (blue) (structures are superimposed over lower part).

In the MD structure, a central 5-nt segment which was either coldspot or hotspot is cyan, and G/T mismatch is highlighted in sphere representation. Detail of G/T pair in the X-ray structure (B) and in MD structure (C).Further, we imposed a shear wall restraint to keep the mismatch pair stable inside the DNA duplex because the mismatch tends to disrupt during the DNA bending, which affects the calculated free energy. Note that in the X-ray DNA-MutSa complex the G/T pair is modestly disrupted, it shows a change in base pair parameter shear, buckle and opening (Fig. 2B) and it is shifted towards minor groove.30 In our computations, we compared global bending of different DNA systems, with stable mismatch base pair inside the duplex. Since various mismatch pairs have different free energy minima for shear, we set up differently the shear restraint ranges to keep the pair stable. The ranges for each mismatch were chosen based on (i) behaviour of the mismatch in the production 150 ns simulations where we determined the distribution of shear values and (ii) extra ABF simulations, where we probed each mismatch via collective variable shear sampled in the range from -5 to 5 Å. Determined shear minima from ABF calculations were in agreement with the distribution of shear values observed in the production simulations (Supplementary Fig. S1). In particular, free energy minima of G/T and A+/C mismatches are -2.25 and -2.58 Å, respectively, so the shear restraint range was set from -10 to 0 Å. Shear restraints for other mismatches are indicated in Supplementary Material.The free energy profiles describing DNA bending were calculated for RMSD in the interval from 1.45 to 5.45 Å. ABF simulations employed a single window approach, which spans the entire range of the sampled collective variable. This window was split into 41 bins, which serve for numerical evaluation of mean force only. The bins are visited by free diffusion once enough samples are collected in individual bins to obtain a good estimate of mean force, which is subtracting from MM potential force to remove any barriers along the collective variable. Five ABF walkers were commenced from five restart files of the production dynamics each taken after 30 ns to establish the independence of walkers. As result, ~2 million samples taken at each MD step were accumulated in each bin, see Supplementary Figure S2. The time step used in our MD simulations was 2 fs. The snapshots were saved to the trajectory file every 5,000 steps (10 ps).The relaxed DNA is shown as a minimum on the free energy profile (Supplementary Fig. S3), representing a stable thermodynamic state. On the contrary, the bent structure is not thermodynamically stable because of the absence of MutSa in our model. Therefore, we had to select RMSD value which would represent the bend state and serve to compare coldspots and hotspots. To guess a fair estimate, we have analysed the behaviour of the relaxed DNA state observed in the 150 ns production dynamics. RMSD towards an average DNA structure was calculated over the entire production dynamics. In other words, we have reversed the definition of the target structure for RMSD calculation from the bend conformation to the relaxed conformation. Depending on the system, the RMSD using this target fluctuated from 1 to 4 Å, with maximum occurrence at about 1.55 Å for the set of atoms defining used RMSD, see Supplementary Figure S2 in ref.39 This value was then set as a threshold representing a bend structure to deduct bending free energies from the ABF/MWA simulations.To evaluate the significance of calculated bending free energies between coldspots and hotspots we calculated errors directly from the ABF/MWA simulations. The error of the mean force [s(dG/dRMSD)] is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 (left). The error is small and approximately constant in the entire range of RMSD indicating no problem with sampling. The integrated value of errors for the resulting free energy is shown in Supplementary Figure S4 (right). Its value at RMSD threshold of 1.55 Å is ~0.3 kcal/mol (Supplementary Table S1). We also repeated ABF calculations (i.e. we ran new independent simulations with different starting restart files) for C01, C02, H01 and H02 motifs with G/T. Comparison with original calculations can be found in Supplementary Table S2, the found differences indicate errors in the calculated free bending energies, which is in the same range as provided by the previous analysis, i.e. 0.3 kcal/mol.2.4. Logistic regressionWe performed logistic regression based on calculated bending free energies of coldspots/hotspots to classify other studied groups of motifs (i.e. motifs with CpG or CpHpH sequence, population hotspots and motifs with de novo mutations). The analysis was performed in R. Coldspots were defined as Group 0 and hotspots as Group 1. Obtained P-values close to 1 indicate that particular motif behaves as a hotspot while P-values close to 0 indicate that motif behaves as coldspot. The classification was performed based on bending free energies for G/T pair, which best-distinguished coldspots and hotspots.2.5. DNA melting curve analysisWe measured a DNA duplex stability for 15-nt long DNA oligonucleotides carrying coldspot/hotspot motifs. We designed the same sequences, which were used in our calculations, i.e. the forward sequence was 5’GAACC XXGXX CTAGG3’, the reverse complementary sequence was (5’CCTAG XXTXX GGTTC3’). The central region contained coldspot or hotspot with G/T pair (in bold). The mixture of both primers (1 µM each; final concentration was tuned to maintain equal starting fluorescence signal for all analysed samples) in 1 mM KCl was denatured (90°C) and slowly (0.1°C/s) cooled to 4°C. Hybridized oligonucleotides were kept on the ice, and EvaGreen dye (Biotium) was added to the final concentration 1× (according to the manufacturer’s instructions). The melting analysis was performed in the range 20–90°C (0.2°C/s; fluorescence acquired at each temperature step) on Rotor-Gene 6000 (Qiagen). The melting curves were analysed using Melt curve analysis implemented in RotorGene software as the derivative of the raw data.3. Results and discussion3.1. Bending of 10 top coldspots and 10 hotspots with G/T and A+/C mismatchesWe used two coldspots (C01-AAGAA and C02-CAGTG) and two hotspots (H01-AGGTA and H02-TGGAA) from our previous study39 (systems with G/T described in our previous study were recalculated with the new version of PMFLib, which was used in free energy calculations of other systems in this study) and added eight new coldspots and eight new hotspots with lowest Fisher combined P-values calculated in our previous study. These P-values were determined based on analysis of mutations in five genes (LDLR, PAH, CFTR, F8 and F9) and indicate significance for each motif to be a coldspot or hotspot (see Tables 2 and 3 in39). In the case of hotspots, we excluded motifs with CpG dinucleotide in the middle of the 5-nt segment and also CpHpG motifs because mutability of these sequences can be associated with deamination of mC leading to C > T mutations that are primarily targeted by BER pathway (analysis of motifs with CpG and CpHpG was thus conducted separately, see below).Bending free energies of top 10 coldspots and top 10 hotspots with G/T and A+/C pairsBending free energies smaller than 13.0 kcal/mol are in grey fields.Bending free energies of top 10 coldspots and top 10 hotspots with G/T and A+/C pairsBending free energies smaller than 13.0 kcal/mol are in grey fields.Bending free energies of hotspots with CpG and CpHpG sequenceBending free energies smaller than 13.0 kcal/mol are in grey fields.Bending free energies of hotspots with CpG and CpHpG sequenceBending free energies smaller than 13.0 kcal/mol are in grey fields.Bending free energies of 10 Czech population hotspots with G/T and A+/CCpG or CpHpG motifs are in bold and energy below 13 kcal/mol is in the grey field.Number of alleles indicated in our publications (see above)/number of alleles detected up to date if differ.This motif is already included among top hotspots with CpG see Table 2.Bending free energies of 10 Czech population hotspots with G/T and A+/CCpG or CpHpG motifs are in bold and energy below 13 kcal/mol is in the grey field.Number of alleles indicated in our publications (see above)/number of alleles detected up to date if differ.This motif is already included among top hotspots with CpG see Table 2.Since coldspots have mostly A-T pair in the middle of the 5-nt segment, whereas hotspots have G = C pair (see sequence logo in Fig. 3 in ref.39), different representation of mismatches exists in coldspots and hotspots. In particular, G/T, A+/C, A/G and C/T are equally represented, but A/A and T/T pairs occur more frequently in coldspots while C+/C and G/G exist more often in hotspots. Base pairs G/T and A+/C can substitute the canonical pairs G = C and A-T without large structural perturbation of the duplex.29,59 Their H-bonding scheme and the C1’–C1’ distances are similar to the canonical pairs (Fig. 1). Other non-canonical pairs show larger differences in the C1’–C1’ distances (Fig. 1) and have more variable base pairing.38 In addition, G/T and A+/C are results of transitions (purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine substitutions), which are more frequent than transversions (purine-to-pyrimidine or pyrimidine-to-purine substitutions).44 Therefore, we primarily focussed on bending analysis of coldspots and hotspots with these mismatches.Melting curves of oligonucleotide duplexes with the G/T mismatch acquired using RotorGene software, the derivative of the raw fluorescence with respect to temperature (dF/dT) is shown. (A) systems with 0 G = C base pair, (B) systems with 1 G = C base pair and (C) systems with 2 G = C base pairs. Bending free energies of analysed motifs are indicated.

(D) The melting curve fitted by exponential function in the range of 52–90°C. Our calculations showed that coldspots with G/T and A+/C pairs are in average more flexible than hotspots about 1.2 and 0.6 kcal/mol, respectively (see Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3 where bending free energy profiles are visualized). Considering the error size of calculated free energies, which is around 0.3 kcal/mol (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), the difference between coldspots and hotspots with G/T is significant while the difference between coldspots and hotspots with A+/C is comparable with the error size. We also found several exceptions, e.g. hotspots H06 and H10 show relatively low bending free energies for G/T while some coldspots exhibit higher bending free energies (e.g. C04, C06 and C10, see Table 1). Based on our hypothesis we assume that coldspots are on average (considering all mismatch types) more flexible than hotspots, but we do not expect that every coldspot with any mismatch will be more flexible than any hotspot. Also, we do not consider here that mutability of DNA could be affected by other factors than by sequence elasticity and that MD methods suffer from various approximations. For instance study by LaRosa and Zacharias60 showed that local untwisting and bending of the DNA lowers the penalty for flipping of modified base (8oxoG), which is recognized by bacterial MutM protein (homologue of human hOGG1) within BER. Most probably, a similar mechanism plays a role in MMR, where DNA bending can be facilitated by disrupted mismatch base pair. However, in this study, we restrained the central mismatch base pair inside duplex because it opened spontaneously only in some ABF simulations, which prevented comparison of the global bending properties among different systems. Thus, our analysis aimed to detect a potential difference in global elasticity between coldspots and hotspots.Based on logistic regression, we calculated P-values for hotspots and coldspots (Table 1). It can be seen that P-values of the most hotspots are around 0.8 or 0.9, only H06, H07 and H10 motifs exhibit lower values (Table 1). In the case of coldspots, six motifs exhibit P-values below 0.3, other four motifs: C04, C06, C09 and C10 have P-values between 0.46 and 0.68, so none of them behaves as a typical hotspot.3.2. Bending of 10 top coldspots and 10 hotspots with other mismatchesIn the bending analysis of G/A, C/T, A/A, C+/C, T/T and G/G, we encountered a problem with the stability of some mismatched base pairs. We observed disruptions of symmetrical A/A, G/G and C+/C mismatches during bending which lasted for several ns during the ABF simulations. Although shear of the mismatch was restrained (as described in Supplementary Material), the mismatch was perturbed in such extent that its bases stack on top of each other (Supplementary Fig. S5). Our tests revealed that DNA with a disrupted mismatch has lower bending free energy than when the pair is perfectly stable (observed for DNA with G/T pair). This indicates that DNA with perturbed pair can be bent more easily, which correlates with observation in ref.35 where abasic DNA compared with DNA with various mismatches exhibited lowest bending free energy. We were not able to stabilize these mismatches in the ABF simulations. Therefore, we did not derive bending free energies for these systems. Other mismatches C/T, A/G and T/T were stable during bending. In the case of C/T and A/G mismatches, we did not detect a significant difference between bending free energies of coldspots and hotspots, although coldspots were slightly more flexible than hotspots (Supplementary Table S3). In the case of T/T pair we observed the opposite trend, i.e. hotspots were more flexible than coldspots (Supplementary Table S3). However, it should be noted that this mismatch is not equally distributed in coldsots and hotspots, thus we analysed only four hotspots with T/T and eight coldspots with T/T. In the available X-ray complexes of DNA/MutS A/A, G/G and A/C pairs exist in anti-syn conformation,61,62 only G/T pair was detected in anti-anti (Fig. 2).30 Most probably the initial anti-anti form, which is prevailing in the free form of DNA, is not suitable geometry for DNA complexed with protein. Although C/T, A/G and T/T pairs stayed stable in the ABF simulations, we assume that mismatches less compatible with the canonical pairs require base-pair rearrangement during bending to optimize its geometry. Keeping mismatch in one base pair geometry can create tension which might affect bending free energy. It is also possible that rearrangement of the A/C mismatch during bending (we performed bending analysis with A+/C in anti-anti form, while there is unprotonated anti-syn form in the X-ray structure of DNA/MutS) would increase a difference in bending free energies between coldspots and hotspots. However, description of controlled mismatch rearrangement during bending would require more collective variables, which would be very computationally demanding. In the next sections, we analysed the bending of other DNA motifs but only with G/T and A+/C pairs.3.3. Bending of CpG and CpHpG motifs with G/T and A+/CIn our previous study, motifs with CpG or CpHpG were frequently detected as hotspots; particularly, these motifs represented 14 out of top 20 hotspots (see Table 3 in ref.39). Thus, we separately analysed three hotspots with CpG and three hotspots with CpHpG possessing G/T and A+/C pairs (Table 2). These hotspots have low Fisher combined p-values39 and belong among top 10 hotspots in our previous study.39 Calculated bending free energies of these systems are low and correspond to coldspots rather than hotspots, particularly, average bending free energies were 12.7 and 12.2 kcal/mol for G/T and A+/C, respectively. Calculated P-values from the logistic regression were below or around 0.5. This correlates with previous computational studies31,63–65 where pyrimidine–purine and purine–purine (or pyrimidine–pyrimidine) dinucleotides were found to be more flexible than purine–pyrimidine.3.4. Bending of DNA with Czech population hotspotsWe investigated the bending properties of 10 population hotspots detected in Czech patients. Theoretically, a DNA site can become a population hotspot due to only one mutation event, when the arisen mutation is spread throughout the population. Thus, bending properties of these sequences do not have to exhibit stiffness which we detected in hotspots described in Table 1.Our cooperating genetic laboratory (in Centre of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, University Hospital Brno) analyses mainly genes associated with neuromuscular, skin and metabolic diseases. Therefore, we focussed on the most significant Czech population hotspots in these genes detected in our previous studies. In particular, we analysed hotspots within 5-nt segments in: TGM1, ALOXE3, ALOX12b genes associated with congenital ichthyoses,40 in CAPN3, SGCA and ANO5 genes associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophies,66 in LDLR gene associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia,67 in PAH gene associated with phenylketonuria,68 in ATP7B gene associated with Wilson disease69 and in CLCN1 gene associated with Myotonia Congenita70 (Table 3). As mentioned earlier we analysed only population hotspots leading to transitions. Many analysed population hotspots contain CpG or CpHpG (8 out of 10). It can be seen that five motifs with CpG or CpHpG have low bending free energies (around or below 13 kcal/mol) for both mismatches, only three motifs with CpG (in ALOXE3, TGM1 and CLCN1) exhibited higher bending free energies for one mismatch (Table 3). In the case of motif in ALOX12B, which does not contain CpG or CpHpG sequence, its bending free energies are high for both mismatches (14.0 kcal/mol for G/T and 14.1 kcal/mol for A+/C), the second non-CpG motif (in ATP7B gene); however, has low bending free energies for both mismatches. Thus, we can see a quite wide range of bending free energies, but on average, bending free energies of these systems are low. P-values derived from the logistic regression are similar to CpG/CpHpG motifs, i.e. 9 out of 10 motifs have a P-value below 0.53 (Table 3), which indicates that bending properties of these motifs are closer to coldspots described in Table 1.3.5. Bending of DNA with de novo mutationsAnalysis of coldspots/hotspots with G/T and A+/C showed that mutations arise more often in the rigid sequences. To test this observation, we performed bending analysis of 15 de novo mutations within 5-nt segments on non-CpG/non-CpHpG sites and we selected only mutations leading to G/T and A+/C pairs. Mutations from ADA, IL2RG, SERPING1, STAT3 and WAS were provided by the cooperating department at the Centre for Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, Brno, particularly, mutations in ADA, SERPING1 and STAT3 were entirely novel (not published before), mutations in IL2RG and WAS were recently published by the cooperating department.71,ADA, IL2RG, STAT3 and WAS genes are associated with immunodeficiencies, whereas SERPING1 is associated with hereditary angioedema. Further, eight novel mutations were taken from the PAH gene. In our previous study,68 we described six novel missense mutations. Three of them (transitions located on non-CpG sequences: p.Asp229Gly, p.Phe263Ser and Ile406Met) were included among the 15 de novo mutations (Table 4). Other five mutations in PAH were taken from the HGMD database from the beginning of the protein sequence (p.Met1Ile, p.Ser16Pro, p.Ser40Leu, p.Lys42Glu and p.Val45Ala). In the study,70 we reported two novel mutations in CLCN1 gene leading to transitions: missense mutation c.905A>G, p.(Tyr302Cys) and splicing mutation c.433 + 3A>G, the latter is located on the GTAGG motif, which represents known indel hotspot derived from GTAAGT.18 Since GTAGG motif is associated with double base pair substitutions (22%), we analysed only the p.(Tyr302Cys) mutation. The last mutation was taken from CYP4F22 gene where we recently reported two missense mutations (c.844C>T, p.R282W and c.1085G>A, p.R362Q).40 However, because both of them are positioned on the CpG dinucleotide, we selected the most recent reported mutation (c.667C>T, p.Q223Term) in this gene in HGMD.72Bending free energies of motifs with 15 de novo mutations calculated for G/T and A+/C mismatchesBending free energies smaller than 13.0 kcal/mol are in grey fields.This motif is already included in Table 1 as H02.Bending free energies of motifs with 15 de novo mutations calculated for G/T and A+/C mismatchesBending free energies smaller than 13.0 kcal/mol are in grey fields.This motif is already included in Table 1 as H02.Calculations showed that bending free energies of these motifs are somewhat higher with average value 13.6 kcal/mol for G/T and 13.4 kcal/mol for A+/C (Table 4) which is comparable to hotspots in Table 1. Low bending free energies for both mismatches can be seen only for p.His115Arg in WAS gene, p.Ser16Pro in PAH gene and p.Tyr302Cys in CLCN1 gene. Other motifs have bending free energies for at least one mismatch around or above average hotspot value. Logistic regression revealed that except for the three mentioned mutations (p.His115Arg, p.Ser16Pro and p.Tyr302Cys) P-values are higher than 0.52 (seven motifs have P-value even higher than 0.8) (Table 4).Although we do not have large statistical datasets for studied groups, we can see apparent trends in bending free energies calculated for G/T and A+/C pairs. In the case of G/T pair, average bending free energies of coldspots, CpG/CpHpG motifs and motifs with population hotspots are similar and lower compared with the bending free energies of hotspots and motifs with de novo mutations. This trend is less evident for A+/C mismatch where CpG/CpHpG motifs show lowest average bending free energies, and where a smaller difference between coldspots and hotspots exists (this correlates with the fact that bending free energies for G/T were taken as the best classifier in logistic regression).3.6. Melting experiments for selected coldspots and hotspots with G/TPrevious experimental study showed that A-RNA has a higher melting temperature (Tm) than B-DNA,73 which correlates with computational studies74,75 where A-RNA was found to be more stable than B-DNA. Moreover, B-DNA exhibited greater deformability of its backbone than A-RNA, and it was more easily deformed in the global parameters roll and tilt, which were used for calculation of global bending. We measured and analysed melting curves of coldspots and hotspots using thermal denaturation experiments to determine if there is a correlation with calculated bending free energies.First eight coldspots (C01–C08) and first eight hotspots (H01–H08) were analysed with the central G/T mismatch. Since C05-AAAAA after introducing G/T pair changes sequence to AAGAA, which is identical to C01-AAGAA, we analysed only C01 motif in this experiment. As expected, positions of peaks and derived Tm were affected by the number of G = C pairs included in the analysed motifs (Supplementary Fig. S6). Therefore, we separated melting curves according to the number of G = C pairs and compared coldspots and hotspots with 0 G = C, 1 G = C and 2 G = C pairs. For system H07 (GGGCA), which contains 3 G = C pairs, we did not have coldspot to compare it. Therefore this system was not considered.In the plots, we observed a trend where derivative melting curves of rigid motifs decrease slower compare to systems with increased flexibility. This can be seen in the range of 50–70°C. Although this trend is not 100% accurate, it is seen for many motifs in 0 G = C, 1 G = C and 2 G = C groups. For instance, in the case of motifs with 0 G = C (Fig. 3A), H08 motif with highest bending free energy (13.7 kcal/mol) decreases slower than other two systems C01 and C04 with bending free energies 12.4 and 13.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Considering systems with 1 G = C pair (Fig. 3B), the melting curves of motifs decrease almost perfectly according to decreasing bending free energy. The order of decrease is following: H02 with highest bending free energy (14.4 kcal/mol), H01 (bending free energy 13.7 kcal/mol), C06 (bending free energy 13.2 kcal/mol), C03 (bending free energy 11.6 kcal/mol) and C07 (bending free energy 12.2 kcal/mol). For motifs with 2 G = C pairs (Fig. 3C), we also observed the trend except for H03, which decreased slowly as other coldspots although its bending is 14.2 kcal/mol.Further, to compare melting curves quantitatively, each one was fitted by the exponential function in the range of 52–90°C (Fig. 3D). Calculated coefficients b, n and u were derived. The coefficient b represents intercept-like coefficient, and its value is around 0 for all systems while coefficients n and u describe the curvature of the melting curves. Relative comparison of n and u within the groups (0 G = C, 1 G = C and 2 G = C) shows that systems with slow decrease have smaller n but higher u (Supplementary Table S4).3.7. Analysis of local bend, twist and three translational base pair step parameters for 10 coldspots and 10 hotspots with G/T in unbiased 150 ns simulationsAnalysis of local bend revealed no significant differences in the average local bend on central Steps 7 and 8 (containing mismatch base pair) between coldspots and hotspots. However, local bend values of the central Step 7 correlated with the calculated bending free energies. In particular, coldspots C04, C06, C09 and C10 with higher bending free energies (13.0, 13.4, 13.2 and 13.2 kcal/mol) showed lower local bend on this step (8.2, 7.9, 7.8 and 7.7°, respectively) than other coldspots (Supplementary Table S5). Similarly, hotspots H06 and H10 with low bending free energies (12.6 and 12.5 kcal/mol) exhibited higher local bend on this step (10 and 10.8°, respectively) than other hotspots which are stiffer (Supplementary Table S6). Exception is H08, of which bending energy is 13.7 kcal/mol and has also larger local bend (10.7°).In the case of twist, central Steps 7 and 8 in coldspots with average values 25.8 and 41.1° deviate more from standard twist value (ca. 36°) than corresponding steps in hotspots where central Steps 7 and 8 exhibit values 28.9° and 37.8° (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). Analysis of three translational base pair step parameters (shift, slide and rise) revealed no significant differences between coldspots and hotspots and no correlation with the bending free energies (Supplementary Tables S9–S14).It should be noted that biased ABF simulations exhibit two different modes of bending, see graphs of mean force in Figure S4 left. In particular, there are two linear regions, each representing a harmonic mode of bending with different force constants. One is observed in the range from 5.45 to ca 2.5 Å and the second more profound is in the range from 2.5 to 1.5 Å. The bending in the second region has major impact on discrimination between coldspots and hotspots. Basically, the unbiased simulations can reveal information only about the first mode. The second mode, which seems to be more important, is inaccessible in unbiased simulations and it can be expected that important features cannot be deduced from analysis of such MD trajectories.4. ConclusionWe analysed the bending properties of damaged DNA in different sequence contexts employing biased MDs simulations. We tested sequences, which are frequently associated with germline mutations (hotspots) and rarely associated with germline mutations (coldspots). Main attention was paid to motifs with G/T, and A+/C mismatches as these pairs are the result of transitions and have base pair geometry well defined in the duplex structure. Despite the limitation of the employed model, our results revealed the relation between mutability of DNA sequences and their bending properties, particularly, coldspots were found to be more flexible than hotspots (Table 1). This is in agreement with the suggested model of the MMR process,22 in which more flexible segments are more effectively repaired.Our attempt to analyse other mismatch types including A/A, G/G and C+/C failed because biased simulations were not stable and thus derived free energy profiles were affected by other than bending movements. In the case of C/T, A/G and T/T mismatches, the trend in bending free energies between coldspots and hotspots was not convincing. Coldspots with C/T and A/G were found to be slightly more flexible than hotspots, while the opposite trend was detected for T/T mismatch (Supplementary Table S3). This might be solved by employing more collective variables, which would also describe mismatch rearrangement during bending. However, it can be expected that such simulations would be very computationally demanding. Apart from DNA elasticity, detection of mismatches and subsequent repair process in the cell is most likely influenced by other factors, which we did not consider in our model. Thus, we cannot expect a perfect correlation between DNA mutability and elasticity. Moreover, mismatch recognition is fine-tuned by interaction with amino acids phenylalanine 432 and glutamine 434 from MutS protein.30 Our model explaining the emergence of mutations in DNA is therefore simplistic, but it suggests that DNA elasticity plays an important role.Bending analysis of motifs with CpG and CpHpG revealed that bending free energies of these systems are low (Table 2), which indicates that their mutability is more likely related to spontaneous deamination of mC leading to C > T mutations, which are targeted by BER pathway. Similarly, the bending free energies of the Czech population hotspots were lower (Table 3). These motifs often contained CpG and CpHpG sequences. In contrast, motifs with de novo mutations (intentionally selected non-CpG and non-CpHpG sites) exhibited higher bending free energies (Table 4) that were comparable with bending free energies of hotspots (Table 1). This observation supports our hypothesis, which suggests that mutations appear more likely on the rigid DNA sites.Our computational results are further complemented by thermal denaturation experiments where we measured the stability of selected coldspots and hotspots with the G/T mismatch. Obtained results showed that melting curves of hotspots decreased slower than melting curves of coldspots in the range of 50–70°C, so the hotspots exhibit higher stability that could be associated with increased rigidity detected in our calculations.We would like to thank Hana Grombiríková from the Centre for Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, Brno for providing novel mutations in ADA, IL2RG, SERPING1, STAT3 and WAS genes.FundingComputational resources were provided by the CESNET (LM2015042) and the CERIT Scientific Cloud (LM2015085), provided under the programme ‘Projects of Large Research, Development and Innovations Infrastructures’.

IntroductionThe lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are the largest and highest lake group in the world. The lake Selincuo (4,530 m asl) is the largest lake among them. Gymnocypris selincuoensis is the only cyprinid fish living in lake Selincuo, which adapts to the extreme environment with cold climate, high-altitude and limited resources. Two obvious characteristics of this cyprinid fish were late-maturing and slow-growing. The males and females of G. selincuoensis reach sexual maturity at the age of 8 and 9 which are much older than other cyprinid fishes, such as Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Cyprinus carpio and Carassius auratus.1–5 With the climate warming trend on the QTP, the reproductive phenology of G. selincuoensis has advanced 2.9 days per decade on average.6 The average age of G. selincuoensis reaching the weight of 500 g is age 14–16 which is also older than other cyprinid fishes.7,8 As a migration fish species, G. selincuoensis lives in river before age 5, then inhabits in lake, and returns to river during the reproductive season, indicating its adaptation to both saline and fresh water environments.8 Hence, G. selincuoensis is a good model species for studies on adaptive evolution, population genetics and climate change. In our previous studies, much progress has been made in G. selincuoensis, which mainly focused on studying the life history, biogeography, and reproduction and growth under climate change.6–11 However, the genomic or gene resources are still blank in this species, limiting the studies on molecular or genetic analysis.The transcriptome represents all the genes expressed in one cell or a population of cells. A reference transcriptome provides valuable information for studying gene expression and evolution, discovering alternative splicing (AS) events and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and developing molecular markers.12–15 During the last decade, transcriptomic analysis has vastly increased our understanding on the molecular adaptation to various environments. Gene expression, evolutionary selection and AS are believed to be associated with local adaptation in natural environments. For example, differentially expressed genes associated with the immune function have been identified between lake and river sticklebacks, supporting the hypothesis that parasites contribute to adaptation of sticklebacks in lake and river habitats.16,17 Six transcriptome sequences exhibiting signals of strong diversifying selection have been identified between two sympatric and cologically divergent species, benthic Amphilophus astorquii and limnetic Amphilophus zaliosus.18 A high degree of AS events has been detected among cichlid species with disparities in jaw morphology, indicating AS may play an important role in cichlid adaptive radiation.19The transcriptomes of many model and non-model organisms have been generated by short-read sequencing on next-generation sequencing platforms.20 However, owing to the inherent length limitations, short-read sequencing do not provide full-length (FL) transcript sequences, limiting their utility for discovering alternative spliced isoforms.21,22 Furthermore, short-read sequencing may generate low-quality transcripts, leading to incorrect annotations.23,24 Recently, long-read sequencing technology (e.g. PacBio) can help overcome these limitations by providing sequence information of FL cDNA molecules without the need for further assembly.25 This technique has been successively used for transcriptome analysis in a few plant and animal species, providing useful information for reliable transcriptome assemble and annotation and identification of AS.21,22,26–30 Owing to the relatively high cost, long-read sequencing has not been directly used to quantify gene expression for the moment.In this study, we sequenced and analysed the transcriptome of G. selincuoensis by using PacBio Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-seq technologies. The aims of this study include: (i) generation and annotation of an FL reference transcriptome for G. selincuoensis; (ii) detecting alternatively spliced transcript isoforms; (iii) exploring gene expression patterns among various tissues; (iv) identifying potential positively selected genes; and (v) development of gene-associated microsatellite markers. Our results would increase our understanding of the complexity of the transcriptome of G. selincuoensis and provide a valuable genetic resource for further studies on gene expression, adaptive evolution, population genetics, conservation and phylogeny in such species and other Gymnocypris fishes.2. Materials and methods2.1 Sample collection and RNA preparationThree wild females of G. selincuoensis were collected during the reproductive season from the Zageng Tsangpo River (31°48.770' N; 88°25.420' E), a primary tributary of lake Selincuo on 8 May 2018. After anaesthesia with MS222, seven tissues including brain, heart, liver, kidney, gill, muscle and ovary were sampled immediately and stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction. All experimental animal programmes involved in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.For each tissue from each fish, total RNA was extracted using EZNA HP Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA degradation and contamination were verified by ethidium bromide staining of 28s and 18s ribosomal RNA on a 1% agarose gel. RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The concentration of each RNA sample was determined using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For PacBio Iso-Seq, 1 µg of each RNA sample was pooled together for cDNA library construction. For Illumina RNA-Seq, an equal amount of total RNA from three fish was pooled for each tissue, indexed cDNA libraries were then prepared for each tissue sample. The polyA containing mRNA was extracted using oligo-dT attached magnetic beads.2.2 PacBio Iso-Seq library preparation and sequencingThe Iso-Seq library was prepared according to the Pacific Biosciences protocol. Briefly, 1 µg of polyA mRNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA using the Clontech SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit. The optimal amplification cycle number was determined for generating dsDNA. After amplification, PCR product was purified using AMPure PB beads (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and was subjected to construction of SMRTbell library using SMRTBell Template Prep Kit (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). The library was then sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences RSII sequencer using P2.1–C2.1 chemistry with 20 h movies (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA).2.3 Illumina RNA-seq and de novo assemblyThe Illumina library for each tissue sample was constructed using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the polyA mRNA was fragmented using divalent cations at elevated temperature. The RNA fragments were reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis, end repair and ligation of the adapters. The ligated fragments were purified and enriched through PCR to generate the final cDNA library. Finally, seven transcriptomic libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform to obtain 150 bp pair-end reads. The raw paired-end reads were filtered using fastp 0.18.0 with the following parameters: -q 28 -u 20 -l 50 -3 -W 4 -M 30.31 The clean paired-end reads from each library were merged together and then de novo assembled by using Trinity 2.8.4 software with the default parameters.322.4 PacBio Iso-Seq data processing and error correctionPacBio Iso-Seq data were processed using the SMRTlink 5.1 software. Briefly, effective subreads were obtained from the raw reads (parameters: –minLength = 200, –minReadScore = 0.65). Circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads were generated from subread BAM files using the parameters of max_drop_fraction 0.8, min_passes 2 and min_predicted_accuracy 0.8. By searching for the presence of poly(A) signal, 5' and 3' primers, full-length non-chimera (FLNC) reads and non-full-length (NFL) were identified from CCS reads. Consensus isoforms were produced by clustering FLNC reads using the iterative clustering for error correction (ICE) algorithm, and polished by NFL reads using the Arrow algorithm. Additional nucleotide errors in the polished consensus isoforms were corrected using the Illumina RNA-seq short reads with the software LoRDEC (parameters: -k 21, -s 3). Finally, the FL reference transcriptome was obtained after a further clustering with CD-HIT-EST (c = 0.95).332.5 Functional annotation and CDS predictionThe FL transcripts were annotated based on the following databases with the latest releases until 12 August 2018: NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (Nr), non-redundant nucleotide sequences (Nt), Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG/KOG), Swissprot, Pfam, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Ortholog database (KEGG). Four kinds of software were used for functional annotation with the e-value of 1e-10, including BLAST34 for Nt, Diamond35 for Nr, KOG, Swissprot and KEGG, Hmmscan36 for Pfam and Blast2GO37 for GO. The ANGLE pipeline was used to predict open reading frames (ORFs) of each FL transcript.382.6 Prediction of lncRNAsThe lncRNAs were predicted by using four methods, including PLEK,39 CNCI (Coding-Non-Coding Index),40 CPC (Coding Potential Calculator)41 and Pfam protein structure domain analysis,42 with default parameters. These methods can effectively distinguish protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. Transcripts were removed that did not pass any of these analyses, the intersection of the four results were then selected as lncRNAs.2.7 Identification and validation of AS eventsOwing to the absence of an annotated reference genome in G. selincuoensis, the de novo detection of AS events was performed based on the all- vs.-all BLAST according to the method described by Liu et al.28 For example, in an exon skipping event, there should be two High-scoring Segment Pair (HSP) in the alignment of two transcripts. In the shorter transcript, the base pair coordinates representing the end of HSP1 and the start of HSP2 should be sequentially continuous, and in another transcript, the base pair coordinates between the end of HSP1 and the start of HSP2 should be the skipped exon (recorded here as ‘AS Gap’). Twenty AS events were randomly selected to be validated by RT-PCR. For each transcript pair containing putative AS events, primer pairs were designed in the flanking region of ‘AS Gap’. First-stand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa, Japan) with oligo (dT) primer following the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR products were checked using 2.0% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.2.8 Quantification and validation of gene expression levelsThe Illumina shorts reads of each RNA-seq library were aligned to the FL reference transcriptome to obtain unique mapped reads by using bowtie2 software43 (parameters: –end-to-end –no-mixed –no-discordant –gbar 1000 -k 200). The expression level of each transcript for each tissue was calculated and normalized into FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped) values by RSEM software.44 A cut-off value of 1 FPKM was used as the detection limit.45 The expression level of each transcript in each tissue was classified into five categories including very low, low, moderate, high and very high with the FPKM values of 1–3, 3–10, 10–50, 50–100 and >100, respectively. The tissue-specific transcripts are represented by 50-fold higher FPKM level in one tissue compared with all other tissues. Twenty transcripts including 16 tissue-specific transcripts were randomly selected to assess the reliability of our quantification analysis, by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).2.9 Identification of orthologs and evolution analysisThe transcriptome of G. selincuoensis was compared with other three cyprinid fishes, including Danio rerio, Ctenopharyngodon idellus and C. carpio which all have reference genomes and annotations. The protein-coding sequences of D. rerio (GRCz11), C. idellus and C. carpio were downloaded from the websites NCBI, http://www.ncgr.ac.cn/grasscarp and http://www.carpbase.org, respectively. The orthologous groups among the four species were identified by suing OrthoFinder software (version 2.3.1)46 with default parameters. Sequences of each one-to-one orthologous gene were aligned using ParaAT 1.0.47 The non-synonymous substitution rates (Ka), synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and Ka/Ks ratio for each alignment were calculated by KaKs_calculator 2.048 using the YN algorithm.2.10 Detection of microsatellite markersMicrosatellite markers (also known as simple sequence repeats, SSRs) were identified from the FL reference transcriptome using MISA (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/misa.html), with parameters as default. The minimum repeat time for core repeat motifs was set as following: 10 for mononucleotide, 6 for dinucleotides and 5 for trinucleotides, tetranucleotides, pentanucleotides and hexanucleotides. Based on the structural organization of the repeat motifs, SSRs were classified into perfect and complicated (compound or interrupted) SSRs.3. Results3.1 FL reference transcriptomeA total of 5,819,071 subreads were generated from PacBio Iso-Seq with a mean length of 2,833 bp, which yielded 337,042 CCS reads. CCS reads comprised 273,664 FLNC reads and 62,427 NFL reads. After isoform-level clustering (ICE algorithm) and polishing (Arrow algorithm), a total of 134,126 FL polished consensus isoforms were generated from FLNC reads, with a total of 446.23 Mb nucleotide bases. By error correction with Illumina RNA-seq clean data, all consensus isoforms were retained with 3.08 Mb nucleotide bases collected. Finally, the FL reference transcriptome containing 75,435 FL transcripts were obtained after clustering with CD-HIT-EST, with a total of 264.73 Mb nucleotide bases. The average length of all transcripts was 3,509 bp, and the N50 value was 3,870 (Table 1). Summary for the transcriptome of G. selincuoensis using PacBio Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-seqSummary for the transcriptome of G. selincuoensis using PacBio Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-seq3.2 De novo assembly from short readsThe Illumina RNA-seq generated 489.64 million raw reads for all tissue samples. After trimming and filtering, a total of 443.48 million clean reads were obtained for further analysis, with the number of reads for each tissue sample ranging from 60.03 to 68.41 million. Based on these clean reads, Trinity software de novo assembled 680,616 transcripts from 397,627 ‘genes’. After clustering by CD-HIT-EST, a total of 532,241 transcripts were generated with a total of 433.65 Mb nucleotide bases. The average length and N50 length were 815 and 1,479 bp (Table 1).3.3 Comparison between FL and de novo transcriptsThe average length and N50 length of FL transcripts were both larger than that of de novo transcripts (Table 1). Most FL transcripts had the length ranging from 1,500 to 5,000 bp, accounting for 85.03% of the total number (Fig. 1). However, 87.67% of de novo transcripts had the length <1,500 bp. The results of comparison by Blastn showed that 314,567 (59.10%) de novo transcripts exhibited similarity to 94.5% of the FL transcripts, and 28.00% of them were annotated in Nr database. Of the de novo transcripts with no Blastn hit, 71.95% had the length <500 bp, and only 11.13% were assigned to Nr database.

Of all transcripts, 99.44% (75,016) were successfully annotated in at least one database, and 50.38% (38,007) were annotated in all of the databases. For Nt and Nr annotation, 99.23% and 93.80% of homologous hits were assigned to five fish species, respectively, including Sinocyclocheilus rhinocerous, Sinocyclocheilus angustiporus, Sinocyclocheilus grahami, C. carpio and Danio rerio (Supplementary Fig. S1). GO annotations generated 54 Level 2 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S2). Among them, the three most abundant terms under the biological process category were ‘cellular process’ (20.44%), ‘metabolic process’ (17.57%) and ‘single-organism process’ (13.84%). Within the cellular component category, ‘cell part’ (18.16%) and ‘cell’ (18.16%) were the most abundant terms. Of the 11 terms in the molecular function category, ‘binding’ (52.60%) and ‘catalytic activity’ (29.26%) had the highest number of transcripts. For KEGG annotation, transcripts were mainly assigned to more than 370 signalling pathways in 44 Level 2 KEGG groups (Supplementary Fig. S3). Among these Level 2 pathways, the signal transduction pathway had the largest number of transcripts (19,108), followed by endocrine system (8,259), immune system (8,171) and cancers: overview (6,825). The COG-annotated transcripts were classed into 26 categories, with the most number of transcripts in signal transduction mechanisms (10,735), followed by general function prediction only (10,169), post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (5,511) and transcription (3,693) (Supplementary Fig. S4). A total of 75,729 coding sequences were predicted from 73,790 transcripts by ANGLE programme, with the average length of 1,380.56 nucleotides (Supplementary Fig. S5). Among them, 64,710 (87.69%) transcripts were recognized as complete ORFs based on the presence of start and stop codons.

The average length of ‘AS Gap’ in AS events was 586.3 bp. Among the 20 AS events selected for RT-PCR (Supplementary Table S3), 16 (80%) were validated by agarose gel electrophoresis which generated obvious separated gel bands for each AS event (Fig. 4). The gel banding pattern and the size of the fragments were consistent with the AS isoforms generated from Iso-Seq. For the remaining four AS events, RT-PCR products all generated a single gel band. The single band represents the higher expressed isoform in AS3, AS5 and AS13, and the lower expressed isoform in AS19. The detection of AS events was also performed based on Illumina RNA-Seq data. A total of 3,797 pairs of de novo assembled transcripts that might represent AS events were identified by using the same method used for FL transcripts. Among them, 996 (26.23%) AS events were validated by results of FL transcript analysis.

A total of 10,488 transcripts were expressed in all tissues (Fig. 5B). Of the detected transcripts, the largest fraction showed very low expression (1–3 FPKM) followed by low expression (3–100 FPKM) in each tissue, however, only 1.91% and 1.96% on average showed high (50–100 FPKM) and very high (>100 FPKM) expression, respectively. There were 55 and 80 transcripts that showed very low and very high expression in all tissues, respectively. The results of tissue-by-tissue comparison showed that ovary (1,628) and brain (1,494) had the largest number of tissue-specific transcripts, followed by liver (652) and gill (221), with the lowest number in kidney (127), heart (152) and muscle (134) (Fig. 5C). Based on the global expression profiles (Supplementary Table S4), the highest correlation coefficient was observed between gill and kidney (R2 = 0.655), followed by pairs of heart-muscle (R2 = 0.608), heart-gill (R2 = 0.562) and heart- kidney (R2 = 0.554) (Fig. 5D). The expressions of the selected 20 transcripts were all validated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Table S5, Fig. 6).

Among them, 1,565 one-to-one orthologous genes (single copy genes) present in the four species. The Ka/Ks peak between G. selincuoensis and C. carpio was higher than that observed between G. selincuoensis and other two fishes (Fig. 7A). Only two, one and four orthologous genes with strong positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1.0) were detected between G. selincuoensis and D. rerio, C. idellus and C. carpio, respectively, and none of them present in all three pairs. A total of 77 orthologous genes with Ka/Ks >0.3 were observed between G. selincuoensis and other three species (Supplementary Table S6, Fig. 7B). Of them, 45 were assigned to GO terms, such as ‘binding’, ‘catalytic activity’, ‘metabolic process’ and ‘reproduction’ (Supplementary Fig. S6).

The perfect SSRs include 31,960 mononucleotide SSRs, 17,566 dinucleotide SSRs, 6,411 trinucleotide SSRs, 638 tetranucleotide SSRs, 94 pentanucleotide SSRs and 27 hexanucleotide SSRs (Fig. 8A). The number of SSRs gradually decreased along with increasing repeat times of the SSR motifs. Among the dinucleotide SSRs, the most abundant motif was AC/GT (8,874, 50.52%), followed by AT (5,167, 29.41%) and AG/TC (3,465, 19.73%) (Fig. 8B). For trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide SSRs, the most abundant motifs were AAT/ATT (1,443, 22.51%), AGAT/ATCT (131, 20.53%), ATTTG/AAACT (10, 10.64%) and AGCATC (4, 14.81%), respectively.

DiscussionLong-read sequencing technology can capture FL transcripts without the need for further assembly, making it more popular in transcriptome analysis.25 In this study, by using RNA-seq and PacBio Iso-Seq, the transcriptome of G. selincuoensis were firstly reported and compared. The average length and N50 length of the FL transcripts (3,509 and 3,870 bp) were much longer than that of the de novo assembled transcripts of the same fish species (815 and 1,479 bp) as well as other fish species.49–52 The de novo assembled transcripts had the larger number than the FL transcripts, however, the length were mainly <1,500 bp in the former and ranged from 1,500 to 5,000 bp in the latter. The percentage of FL transcripts containing complete ORF region in G. selincuoensis (87.7%) was much higher than that observed in other fishes with RNA-seq, such as Oncorhynchus mykiss (57.1%),49,Oreochromis mossambicus (13.6%),53,Leuciscus waleckii (18.0%)54 and C. carpio (26.2%).55The public databases such as GO, KEGG, Swissprot and Pfam have been widely used for functional annotation of transcriptome sequences. Nt and Nr consist of non-redundant nucleotide and protein sequences deposited in GenBank and other DNA databases, representing the largest nucleotide and protein databases. In this study, 98.47% and 92.39% of FL transcripts were annotated in Nt and Nr, respectively, indicating that the transcripts contain few non-coding sequences, such as lncRNAs and intergenic sequences. For other databases used for blastx annotation, the highest percentage of transcripts was annotated in KEGG, accounting for 90.0% of all transcripts, followed by 85.11% in Swissprot and 66.31% in KOG. The percentage of annotated transcripts may be related to the number of deposited sequences in the databases. KEGG contains nearly 30.00 million KEGG genes and 22,639 KEGG Orthology,56 Swissprot contains ~0.56 million proteins,57 and KOG is composed of ~0.11 million proteins and 4,852 clusters of orthologs.58 The percentages of annotated transcripts in this study were higher than those reported by short-read RNA-Seq analysis, indicating the advantage of long-read sequencing for obtaining real transcriptome transcripts.PacBio long-read transcriptome sequencing is advantageous over the short-read RNA-Seq in the identification of AS events.59,60 Recently, a pipeline based on all- vs.-all BLAST was proposed by Liu et al.28 to identify AS events from long-read sequences without using a reference sequence. In this study, by using the same pipeline, 2,069 AS events were detected from 75,435 the FL transcripts, with a higher proportion than that detected in Amborella trichopoda.28 Based on RT-PCR, the percentage of confirmed AS events was 80% (16/20) which was similar to that in A. trichopoda (82.9%). Interestingly, among three of the four AS events validated unsuccessfully, the clear band on the agarose gel all represents the higher expressed isoform, and the missing band represents the lower expressed isoform with FPKM values <1 in all tissues. The extremely low expression of one isoform may lead to the failure of RT-PCR validation of AS events. The amplified fragment of the isoform with very low expression is difficult to be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.In this study, the gene expression level of each tissue was quantified by mapping Illumina shorts reads to the PacBio FL transcripts. The percentage of housekeeping transcripts (with a minimum of 1 FPKM value in each tissue) (13.9%) was lower than that detected in O. mykiss (17.0%), and higher than O. kisutch.49,61 The difference may be due to variations in sequencing technologies and number of studied tissues. Using various sequencing technologies, a wide range of percentages of housekeeping genes were reported in mouse and human.45,62–64 Different numbers of expressed transcripts were detected among various tissues with the largest number in brain followed by kidney and gill, and the lowest number in liver and muscle, which was similar to that observed in O. mykiss,49,O. kisutch,62 mouse63 and human.45 The distribution of the number of tissue-specific transcripts among tissues was also similar to that observed in O. mykiss, O. kisutch, with the largest number in ovary and brain and the lowest number in muscle. Significant correlations in expression were observed between any pairs of heart, gill and kidney, owing to that they all belong to the blood and immune system. The gene expression atlas in this study would provide basic information for researches of genetics and genomics in G. selincuoensis.Comparative genomic analysis has been widely used to study the genetic bases of adaptation evolution.65 When the reference genome sequence is not available, transcriptome sequence especially obtained by long-read sequencing is a valuable and effective resource for comparative genomic analyses in non-model organisms. In this study, based on one-to-one orthologous genes, G. selincuoensis had a closest evolutionary relationship with C. carpio when compared to D. rerio and C. idellus. However, the mean and peak of Ka/Ks values between G. selincuoensis and C. carpio were both higher than that between G. selincuoensis and other two fishes, indicating that accelerated evolution occurred in G. selincuoensis after split from C. carpio. The accelerated evolution may be associated with the uplift of the QTP. Among the orthologous genes with potential positive selection in G. selincuoensis, Zp3 (zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3) and Nanog (homeobox transcription factor Nanog) were associated with reproduction and may be involved in adaption to the strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the QTP. In G. selincuoensis, fertilization is external, and eggs and sperms are exposed to the strong UV radiation after the shedding from the mature gonads.Each FL transcript contains 0.75 (56.696/75,435) perfect SSR on average in G. selincuoensis. This SSR frequency was higher than that detected by RNA-Seq in previous studied fishes, such as C. carpio (0.36),66,Ctenopharyngodon idella (0.05),15,H. molitrix (0.16)67 and G. przewalskii (0.15).68 The difference was mainly due to variation in sequencing technology, de no assembled transcripts had a higher proportion of transcripts with short length, leading to fewer detected rate of SSRs. The most abundant motifs of mononucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide SSRs were A/T, AC/GT and AAT/ATT, respectively, which has already been reported in other fish species.15,66,68 SSRs obtained in this study were closely related to expressed functional genes, and would be useful for future genetic and genomic analyses in G. selincuoensis.5. ConclusionIn summary, we present here the first transcriptome of G. selincuoensis by using PacBio Iso-Seq and RNA-seq. The FL reference transcriptome comprised 75,435 transcripts with the N50 value of 3,870. Among these FL transcripts, 99.44% were annotated to Nt, Nr, Swissprot, KOG, KEGG, GO and Pfam databases. A number of AS events were detected and validated from the FL transcripts. An atlas of gene expression was obtained by mapping RNA-seq shorts reads to the FL transcripts. Seventy-seven orthologous genes with potential positive selection were identified by comparative genomic analysis. Furthermore, a large number of gene-associated SSRs were identified. Our results would provide an important and valuable foundation for further studies on adaptive evolution, population genetics, conservation and phylogeny in G. selincuoensis and other congeneric fishes.We thank Dr Xiaoyun Sui for her assistance during field sampling.Accession numbersThe sequencing data generated by PacBio Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-seq have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA; http://gsa.big.ac.cn/) under accession number PRJCA001266.FundingThis study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB31040101 and XDA20050204), the Second Comprehensive Scientific Expedition to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, National Natural Science Foundation of China (31601844) and National Basic Research Program of China (2014FY210700).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionIn the last decades, several types of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)—transcripts longer than 200 nt characterized by the absence of long open reading frames—have been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes,1 but the function of most of them remains enigmatic. Most lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II2 and exhibit prominent tissue-specific expression.3 Even though they share some defining features, their modes of action involve a plethora of distinct molecular mechanisms, including modulation of nuclear architecture, chromatin modification, DNA methylation, transcription regulation, post-transcriptional processing, translation regulation, RNA stability control, biogenesis of miRNAs, and control of protein activity.4–6 An example of mammalian lncRNA with known molecular mechanism is Xist, a long non-coding transcript that recruits a series of molecular players to initiate large-scale silencing of one X chromosome in female cells.7 Most described lncRNAs recruit histone complex modifiers, such as polycomb-repressive complex 2, to initiate remodelling of various portions of the genome.8 Other lncRNAs seem to act by modulating DNA methylation, such as a recently described lncRNA that, once transcribed, controls DNA methylation at a nearby promoter in the protocadherin-a gene, leading to increased transcription of the corresponding protein-coding RNA through stochastic alternative promoter usage in sensory neurons of the mouse olfactory system.9Olfaction is probably the most important sense for terrestrial animals,10 being crucial for the recognition of a range of environmental stimuli and for appropriate behavioural, physiological, and endocrine responses related to finding food, avoiding danger, and interacting with individuals of the same species. The two most important olfactory sensory organs in mammals are the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO), located in the nasal cavity. The MOE is related to the general perception of odours,10 while the VNO is typically associated with instinctive behaviours triggered by intra- and inter-specific communication cues, such as sex, aggression, territoriality, parental care, and defensive responses towards predators.11During olfactory sensory neuron differentiation, several molecular mechanisms involving chromatin remodelling take place to shape the detection properties of these cells.12–15 For example, each MOE neuron singularly expresses only one type of odorant receptor gene allele chosen among 2,000 possible loci in the genome, a process shown to involve specific epigenetic changes in the genome.13,15–20 Given the role of lncRNAs in chromatin remodelling, we hypothesize they may play a role in controlling how olfactory neurons attain their unique molecular characteristics.In this article, we used a combination of transcriptome analyses and a machine-learning model to provide for the first time a comprehensive list of lncRNAs in olfaction, including annotated as well as a large set of novel non-coding transcripts. We also identified lncRNAs preferentially expressed in the mouse olfactory organs and determined the temporal patterns of olfactory lncRNA expression during organismic development and sensory neuron differentiation. As an example of how the list of lncRNAs could be useful, we uncovered lncRNAs expressed in mature sensory neurons of the MOE as well as an lncRNA expressed in progenitor cells of the VNO.2. Materials and methods2.1. Transcriptome assemblyWe used data from 5 different studies,21–25 totalling 49 samples, of which 43 are from adult mice (brain, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, heart, kidney, liver, MOE, and VNO) and 6 are from newborn animals (MOE and VNO). Splicing-aware read mapping was performed using STAR (version 2.5.1b)26 with a 2-pass mapping step to gather splice junctions detected during the first mapping step. The transcriptomes were assembled with Cufflinks (version 2.2.1)27 to the GRCm38 primary assembly masked version, downloaded from Ensembl, and Cuffmerge was used to merge together the resulting assemblies, using the ‘ref-gtf’ parameter to include GENCODE’s comprehensive gene annotation (release M9).2.2. Candidate lncRNA identification in the assembled transcriptomeTo identify possible lncRNAs in the transcriptome reconstructed by Cuffmerge, we adopted a two-step pipeline: firstly, we devised a model of classification of non-coding RNAs using a machine-learning approach with XGBoost (version 0.6 of the xgboost Python package),28 and this model was used to identify possible lncRNAs in the transcriptome; next, a genomic overlap filtering step was performed to eliminate non-coding RNAs that do not match the defining criteria for identifying lncRNAs, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, miRNAs, and untranslated region (UTR) fragments. For the latter, we first obtained the sequences of all annotated UTRs in the Ensembl database (release 87) using the biomaRt software (version 2.30).29 Next, the length distributions of the sequences obtained were inspected, and we selected their upper quartile [160 bp (5'-UTR) and 792 bp (3'-UTR)]. A GTF file containing intervals corresponding to the annotated coding regions plus the representative length values for the UTRs (artificial coding transcripts) was generated and we excluded one-exon transcripts that showed any overlap with the artificial coding transcripts. For transcripts with multiple exons, we excluded only transcripts whose overlap with the artificial coding transcripts comprised >25% of its length. More details on the machine learning and lncRNA identification via the bioinformatics pipeline can be found in the Supplementary Methods section and in the Supplementary Computational Notebook.2.3. Quantification of transcript expressionKallisto index was generated from the Cuffmerge assembled transcriptome. Transcript abundances were estimated using the ‘bias’ parameter to correct the quantification for sequence bias,30 and the parameter ‘bootstrap-samples’ was used to generate 100 bootstrap samples during the expectation-maximization step. For samples with unpaired reads (single-end), the parameters ‘fragment-length’ and ‘sd’ were set to 200 and 80 bp, respectively.31 Between-sample abundance normalization was applied to the raw abundance data (TPM values) using library size factors as computed by sleuth (version 0.30.0).32 Gene-level abundance was obtained summing up the normalized abundances of all isoforms. Several subsequent steps in our work used transcript level expression values because of the possibility of different isoforms of the same gene exhibiting different expression patterns among tissues and distinct molecular functions.2.4. Identification of transcripts preferentially or differentially expressed in the olfactory organsTo quantify a transcript’s specificity of expression in a given tissue, we used the tspex Python package to calculate the SPM (specificity measure) metric (see Supplementary Methods for details), using log2(abundance + 1) values at both transcript and gene levels. Differential expression tests were performed to identify differentially expressed transcripts between two biological conditions (male vs. female and adult vs. newborn). For this, kallisto expression quantification incorporating bootstrap data was analysed with sleuth (version 0.30.0),32 using models with covariates indicating the tissue (MOE or VNO), sex (male or female), and age (adult or newborn). Likelihood ratio tests were performed at the transcript level and differentially expressed transcripts were selected at a 5% false-discovery rate threshold.2.5. Analysis of MOE single-cell RNA-Seq librariesThe analysis of MOE scRNA-Seq data was performed with Monocle (version 2.10.0).33 Initially, raw abundance data (TPM) of the 93 scRNA-seq samples were converted to absolute abundance (estimated number of RNA molecules per cell) using the built-in Census algorithm (‘relative2abs’ function).34 Using DDRTree, the absolute abundance matrix of transcripts with variable expression was reduced to a two-dimensional space (‘reduceDimension’ function), in which the path of the pseudotime underlying the expression data was laid.35 Then, the algorithm assigned the position of each cell in that path, that is, the pseudotime associated with that sample (‘orderCells’ function). As the reconstruction of the route was done in an unsupervised way, we defined which end of the pseudotime corresponds to the beginning (precursor cells) and the end (mature neurons) of neurogenesis, based on the expression of Ascl1 (precursor cell marker) and Cnga2 (MOE mature sensory neuron marker). Finally, we performed likelihood ratio tests with the ‘differentialGeneTest’ function to identify transcripts that are differentially expressed between OMP-positive and OMP-negative cells. OMP-positive cells were those in which the absolute abundance of the Omp gene was >100. Transcripts were selected at a 5% false-discovery rate threshold and the ones with higher average expression in the OMP-positive cells were chosen for further analysis. Smooth spline curves representing transcript expression dynamics along pseudotime were obtained for the selected transcripts using the ‘genSmoothCurves’ function.3. Results3.1. A large set of unannotated lncRNAs identified by a novel computational pipeline involving machine learningOur objective was to identify lncRNAs preferentially expressed in the olfactory organs, including novel non-coding RNAs. Therefore, we decided not to restrict our analyses to the mouse genome reference annotation. Instead, we used Cufflinks27 to assemble a new transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from a variety of mouse tissues and organs (Supplementary Table S1), including adult whole brain, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, liver, kidney, heart, and the olfactory organs MOE and VNO.24 The stability of this dataset was checked by comparing with an independently assembled transcriptome using another transcript assembler, StringTie,36 leading up to largely overlapping results (Supplementary Fig. S1). The assembled transcriptome contained 226,171 transcripts, distributed in 58,980 loci, of which 15% were not present in the GENCODE reference annotation (release M9).For this study, we decided to focus on intergenic lncRNAs, the loci of which are not shared with coding genes.37 Since many transcripts were not present in the GENCODE annotation, we used a two-step in silico strategy to classify RNAs into potentially coding or non-coding species and identify intergenic lncRNAs. This pipeline included (i) a novel machine-learning-based model to determine potentially non-coding transcripts, and (ii) a step to exclude transcripts that overlap with coding genes and genes for other kinds of non-coding RNAs.We created a new non-coding RNA classification model, which uses a more efficient machine-learning algorithm and a larger set of informative features than currently available lncRNA predictors.38–42 It consists of an ensemble of 500 decision trees with a total of 21 features to classify transcripts into coding or non-coding (Supplementary Table S2). We selected transcripts annotated as lncRNA or protein-coding in the GENCODE (release M11) and then randomly assigned them to test or training sets, containing 20 and 80% of the total transcripts, respectively, while maintaining the proportion of coding to non-coding RNAs in each set. The model generated with the training set was used to classify lncRNAs in the test dataset (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Computational Notebook for details), and the results were compared with those obtained with other lncRNA prediction software (COME, CPAT, CPC, HMMER,43 lncScore, PhyloCSF,44 and PLEK) on the same test dataset (Fig. 1a). Our model exhibits a better trade-off between sensitivity and precision, and better overall performance, as summarized by a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves (Fig. 1a, Table 1, and Supplementary Fig. S2a).

As not all coding transcripts in GENCODE have annotated UTR regions, it is possible that fragments of UTRs may have escaped our first step of filtering. Therefore, an additional step was used to remove candidate lncRNAs lying within 160 and 792 bp from the 5'- and 3'-ends of coding sequences (CDS), respectively. These values were determined from the upper quartile value of UTR lengths calculated from annotated RNAs in GENCODE (Supplementary Fig. S2b).In total, our classification model identified 23,585 non-coding RNAs that are longer than 200 bp (Fig. 1c), mapping onto 19,448 loci. Of these, 11,435 transcripts in 10,158 loci do not overlap with protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, or other non-coding RNA categories (Fig. 1c). Only 12.8% of all loci (1,301/10,158) have been previously annotated as lncRNAs in GENCODE’s M9 release. Additionally, when we mapped the predicted lncRNA loci onto a reference annotation focussed on non-coding transcripts, NONCODE v5, >45% (4,624/10,158) of our classified lncRNAs fall onto previously mapped non-coding loci.The resulting comprehensive list of candidate intergenic lncRNAs (Supplementary Spreadsheet), which includes transcripts from both unannotated and annotated loci, was chosen for subsequent investigation.3.2. A multitude of lncRNAs is preferentially expressed in the olfactory organsUsually, lncRNAs exhibit unique patterns of expression, characterized by preferential or specific expression in tissues or cell types.3 Because we were interested in identifying lncRNAs potentially involved in the molecular mechanisms of olfaction, we determined the tissue-specificity of expression for the lncRNAs identified in the previous section. We calculated each transcript’s SPM (specificity measure), a parameter that measures the specificity of a gene’s expression in a given tissue or organ.46 As a means of comparison, we calculated the SPM for genes known to be preferentially expressed in the olfactory organs, such as Trpc247 for the VNO, and Cnga248 for the MOE, as well as Omp,49 which is expressed in both olfactory organs (Supplementary Table S3).We chose to select genes that are either preferentially expressed in the VNO (VNOpref transcripts), or preferentially expressed in the MOE (MOEpref transcripts), or preferentially expressed in both tissues as compared with other organs/tissues (VNO+MOEpref transcripts). Moreover, we selected SPM cut-off values of 0.9, 0.9, and 0.55 for VNOpref, MOEpref, and VNO+MOEpref transcripts, respectively, based on SPM values for the marker genes mentioned earlier.This approach led us to identify 3,076 VNOpref, 1,946 MOEpref, and 2,100 VNO+MOEpref transcripts, of which 591, 272, and 344, respectively, were classified as lncRNAs (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Spreadsheet). Our improved long intergenic non-coding RNA identification pipeline was specifically devised to identify unannotated non-coding transcripts, and, thus, we expected that few of the lncRNAs listed above would have been annotated in the genome. In fact, only 6.6% (39/591) of the VNOpref, 4.0% (11/272) of the MOEpref, and 7.6% (26/344) of the VNO+MOEpref lncRNAs are annotated in GENCODE’s M9 release (Supplementary Spreadsheet). When the lncRNAs identified by our classifier were compared with the non-coding specific annotation NONCODE (v5), 14.21% (84/591) of the VNOpref, 11.76% (32/272) of the MOEpref, and 30.81% (106/344) of the VNO+MOEpref lncRNAs correspond to annotated loci (Supplementary Spreadsheet). Even though these numbers are higher than those found with GENCODE, they are still much lower than the percentage of total lncRNAs in NONCODE, probably due to the fact that the olfactory organs possess peculiar molecular characteristics, such that most of the lncRNAs we detected were probably not previously identified in other studies.Among the lncRNAs identified in our study, most of the annotated genes are either not expressed or expressed at low levels in the olfactory organs (Supplementary Fig. S3). This probably reflects the fact that most of the lowly expressed lncRNAs are expressed at higher levels in other tissues and organs, in the context of which they have been described. Importantly, most of the lncRNAs that are highly expressed in the olfactory organs have not been previously annotated (Supplementary Fig. S3) and represent novel non-coding RNA species.3.3. Spatial expression patterns for olfactory lncRNAsNext, we analysed the expression of selected candidate lncRNAs by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization to confirm the in silico expression quantification and to gain further relevant information about their patterns of expression in the olfactory organs. We chose to evaluate several lncRNAs in each of the three preferential expression groups (VNOpref, MOEpref, or VNO+MOEpref). For each group, we selected (i) lncRNAs whose expression falls above the third quartile of TPM (high expression group), (ii) lncRNAs whose expression falls in the interquartile range (medium expression group), and (iii) lncRNAs of low expression that falls below the first quartile (Supplementary Fig. S4), totalling seven genes analysed per tissue preferential group.Of these, the only selected transcripts that map onto annotated lncRNA loci in GENCODE are one VNOpref lncRNA (VNO-D), five VNO+MOEpref lncRNAs (VNO/MOE-A, VNO/MOE-B, VNO/MOE-D, VNO/MOE-F, VNO/MOE-G), and one MOEpref lncRNA (MOE-A), all of which have no known biological function (Supplementary Spreadsheet). Moreover, all selected transcripts were chosen among lncRNAs with multiple exons, since these tend to be bona fide transcripts and not the result of purposeless run-off transcription or transcript misassembly.50Next, we performed reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments, with the dual purpose of confirming the complete expressed sequences for each candidate lncRNA and the preferential nature of their expression in olfactory organs. We designed specific PCR primers for each lncRNA (Supplementary Table S4), positioning them on exons near the ends of each transcript.Out of the 16 lncRNA genes in the high and medium expression groups, only one gene, MOE-E, could not be amplified by RT-PCR (Fig. 2). The majority of the remaining genes in these expression level categories was found to be expressed in the olfactory organs according to the in silico quantifications. For example, VNO-A was more highly expressed in the VNO than in the MOE libraries (Table 2), and the RT-PCR data are in agreement with these expression values (Fig. 2). MOE-C, which was quantified in silico to be more highly expressed in the MOE than in the VNO, was amplified by RT-from both olfactory organs and from other tissues (Fig. 2). Moreover, VNO/MOE-E, which exhibits similar abundance levels in the MOE and VNO RNA-Seq libraries, was amplified from MOE tissue. Of the five genes in the low expression category (below the first quartile), two could not be amplified (VNO-F and VNO-G; Fig. 2) and these have the lowest TPM values (<2.4) across all 21 genes analysed (Table 2).

Sizes of amplified fragments for these loci were concordant with each amplicon’s expected length, as determined by in silico assembly of the corresponding lncRNA transcripts. Exon-intron boundaries were shown to be mostly correct (Supplementary Fig. S5), except in a few cases where the introns were a few nucleotides longer or shorter. The exceptions are: MOE-D, which, though amplified as one band, revealed two slightly distinct splicing variants after sequencing; VNO/MOE-G, which amplified as two bands; and MOE-F, for which the experimentally determined transcript was slightly shorter than the expected size of the lncRNA (Fig. 2), because two exons predicted in silico were missing in the PCR amplified band (Supplementary FASTA file).Next, we conducted in situ hybridization for the lncRNA candidates with specific cRNA probes to investigate their spatial patterns of expression in the olfactory organs. For all genes in the high expression category (yellow labels in Fig. 3), we detected clear in situ hybridization signal in the sensory epithelium and verified preferential expression data concordant with the in silico quantification. For example, VNO-A and MOE-A exhibit strong expression in the VNO and MOE neuroepithelia, respectively, while VNO/MOE-A shows expression in both olfactory organs (Fig. 3; higher magnification images are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6). For lncRNAs in the medium expression group (interquartile TPM range), strong or intermediate staining levels were seen (magenta labels in Fig. 3), except for VNO-D in the VNO and for VNO/MOE-E in the MOE.

Scale bar = 100 µm.Most lncRNAs with discernible in situ hybridization staining in either olfactory organ exhibit a homogeneous spatial pattern of expression in the neuroepithelium (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, our data show that most lncRNAs expressed in the MOE are found throughout the neuroepithelium turbinates, without detectable preferential expression in one or more particular dorsal-ventral zones51,52 (Supplementary Fig. S7c and d).On the other hand, two exceptional lncRNAs exhibit a remarkable punctate staining pattern in the olfactory organs. VNO-E seems to be expressed throughout the VNO epithelium, but more highly so in groups of cells lining the base of this olfactory organ and near the epithelial margins (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6), the same location of the VNO’s progenitor cells.53 Additionally, MOE-G is not expressed in the whole MOE, but in a very defined subpopulation of MOE cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs S6 and S7a and b), which seems to correspond to one of the MOE’s odorant receptor dorsal-ventral expression zones.51,52For some lncRNA candidates, we performed in situ hybridization with probes in the opposite strand, as a control. In the absence of protein-coding information, we synthesized these probes for each lncRNA after confirming the expressed strand with an independent set of MOE RNA-Seq libraries produced via strand-specific SOLiD technology (Table 2). This approach was particularly relevant for intronless transcripts, for which we could not use conserved intron 5' and 3' boundary sequences as a proxy to locate the expressed strand. Most of these lncRNA loci showed no significant staining with control probes in the opposite strand, except VNO/MOE-A, whose expression could be detected with probes in both orientations (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting that transcription from this locus is entailed from both strands.In sum, the novel machine-learning-based pipeline described here allowed us to identify, for the first time, a comprehensive set of long non-coding transcripts in the olfactory organs of mammals. Importantly, we identified hundreds of putative lncRNAs preferentially expressed in the VNO or MOE. We further tested a subset of these transcripts with TPMs encompassing the dynamic range of expression, via a combination of RT-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments, which largely confirmed the preferential expression of high- and medium-TPM lncRNAs in either one or both the olfactory organs. Together, these data strongly suggest that the transcripts identified by our bioinformatics pipeline constitute the long non-coding olfactory transcriptome of mice.3.4. Putative olfactory lncRNA loci are not clustered with olfactory receptor genes or enhancersLoci for all lncRNA transcripts analysed in the previous section were mapped onto the chromosomes in comparison with the location of genes known to be preferentially expressed in the olfactory organs, such as receptor genes in the Or (odorant receptor) family expressed in the MOE or in the vomeronasal receptor V1r and V2r families expressed in the VNO, as well as known olfactory receptor enhancers, such as the H, P, J, and Greek Islands elements, shown to influence the expression of certain groups of odorant receptors in the MOE.14,16,54–59The selected lncRNAs appear not to cluster with those genes and are not in close proximity to the enhancers (Fig. 4). Moreover, when we analysed the distance between all loci for lncRNAs with preferential expression in the olfactory organs and olfactory regulatory sequences, no enhancers were located within 5 kb from the nearest lncRNA gene (not shown). lncRNA loci are not near olfactory enhancers or receptor genes. Chromosomal location of lncRNA loci (named according to Table 2) on the mouse chromosomes, relative to odorant receptor (Olfr) gene loci (blue dots), vomeronasal V1R receptor gene (Vmn1r) loci (green dots) and vomeronasal V2R receptor gene (Vmn2r) loci (yellow dots).

Black and greyscale bars represent cytogenetic bands, as retrieved from UCSC’s Genome Browser.3.5. lncRNA expression in the olfactory organs is not influenced by genderThe VNO is responsible for initiating a series of gender-specific responses, such as aggression between males,60,61 choice of sexual partners,60,62,63 courtship behaviour, and lordosis behaviour.64 Although the MOE is not typically associated with the generation of instinctive behaviours, signalling through this organ is fundamental to the display of dimorphic sexual behaviours in males and females.65,66 Therefore, it is plausible to suspect that the animal’s gender is, to some extent, encoded at the sensory interface of the olfactory organs, in the form of variations in the repertoire of expressed genes, including lncRNAs.Thus, we conducted in silico differential expression tests to investigate whether lncRNA expression is gender-biased or gender-specific. Differential expression analysis between males and females revealed few transcripts differentially expressed between the sexes in the olfactory organs (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Supplementary Table S5). Importantly, none of the differentially expressed genes were lncRNAs. Even though these results are counterintuitive, they are in agreement with another report that did not detect gender-biased expression of olfactory receptors in the MOE or VNO.243.6. A catalogue of lncRNAs expressed in mature olfactory sensory neuronsThe differentiation of olfactory neurons is a complex process that involves morphological changes and the acquisition of peculiar molecular characteristics. For example, the differentiating cell undergoes a series of molecular events that culminate with the stochastic choice of one olfactory receptor type to express out of thousands of receptor genes in the genome (singular receptor choice), a phenomenon not completely understood.67 It is thought to involve epigenetic modifications known to take place during olfactory differentiation,68 as well as nuclear architecture reorganization.12,69 Because lncRNAs have been shown to act through epigenetic mechanisms,3 it is conceivable to hypothesize that they play a functional role in one or more of the many cell types along the differentiation lineage, including mature olfactory neurons.In order to obtain a comprehensive catalogue of olfactory lncRNAs expressed in mature MOE sensory neurons, we took a two-step approach. First, we reasoned that lncRNAs more highly expressed in adults would be enriched for non-coding transcripts expressed in mature neurons, because the adult epithelium contains a comparatively much larger population of mature neurons than newborns.70 The list of transcripts differentially expressed between adults and newborns is extensive (6,784 of 226,171 transcripts) and 67.6% of these are more highly expressed in adults than in newborns (dots below the diagonal 45° dashed line in Fig. 5a). Importantly, we counted 268 lncRNAs (out of 11,435 in total) differentially expressed between adults and newborns, 233 of which (86.9%) are more abundant in the adult MOE.

Size bar is 100 µm.Considering only the lncRNAs preferentially expressed in the MOE (MOEpref), we found 93 lncRNAs (out of 272 in total) that are differentially expressed between adults and newborns (dark dots in Fig. 5a, left), 91 of which are more highly expressed in adults. When we focussed on the lncRNAs preferentially expressed in both olfactory organs relative to other tissues (VNO+MOEpref), we found 39 lncRNAs (out of 344 in total) that are differentially expressed between the ages in MOE tissue (dark dots in Fig. 5a, right), 36 of which are prevalently found in adults.Because we were interested in identifying lncRNAs expressed in mature olfactory neurons, which are positive for Olfactory Marker Protein (OMP) transcripts,49 we further filtered the combined list of 91 MOEpref and 36 VNO+MOEpref lncRNA transcripts more highly expressed in adults by selecting those expressed in OMP-positive single MOE cells. These cells are part of a panel of 93 dissociated main olfactory epithelial cells in distinct stages of differentiation.71The dynamics of lncRNA expression in the MOE was analysed using single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data from the dissociated cells. This approach reconstructed the olfactory lineage differentiation path, as revealed by the position of individual scRNA-Seq samples on a bidimensional space constructed using expression data (Fig. 5b) and comparison with marker genes for several stages along olfactory differentiation, including OMP (Fig. 5c). Of the initial list of 127 (91 + 36) lncRNAs more highly expressed in adults, 9 VNO+MOEpref and 13 MOEpref non-coding transcripts (Supplementary Spreadsheet) were found to be differentially expressed in the OMP-positive subpopulation in comparison with OMP-negative single cells (Fig. 5c), with varying temporal patterns of expression along the differentiation pseudotime.We chose to validate the expression of multi-exon lncRNAs from this short list of olfactory transcripts expressed in mature sensory neurons. Three transcripts matched these criteria—VNO/MOE-A, MOE-D, and MOE-G (Fig. 5d)—and we performed double in situ hybridization experiments with probes for OMP and each of these lncRNAs. Chromogenic detection of hybridized MOE-G probe revealed a striking punctate spatial expression pattern in the MOE epithelium (Fig. 3); when combined with fluorescent detection of OMP probe, cells staining positive for the lncRNA clearly co-express the OMP marker (Fig. 5e), indicating that these are mature olfactory neurons and corroborating the in silico prediction. Additionally, we investigated lncRNAs VNO/MOE-A and MOE-D using the same approach: these transcripts are expressed throughout the MOE epithelium (Fig. 3) and we confirmed them to be expressed in mature olfactory neurons by double in situ hybridization with OMP (Fig. 5e).Together, our analyses combined whole tissue and single-cell transcriptome data, differential expression, and in situ validation experiments to produce a list of putative lncRNAs expressed in mature olfactory sensory neurons.3.7. One lncRNA is expressed in neural progenitor cells of the VNOBoth the MOE and VNO continuously generate new neurons throughout adult life via differentiation from a stock of progenitor cells located deep within the neuroepithelium.72 Olfactory neurogenesis is unique, but few genes have been shown to be specifically expressed in progenitor cells of the olfactory organs. In particular, little is known about the molecular characteristics of the progenitor subpopulation in the VNO.We used in situ hybridization to analyse the spatial pattern of expression for one of the lncRNAs discovered in our study, VNO-E, which is preferentially expressed in the VNO. Our initial analyses determined that such non-coding transcript is expressed in a small subpopulation of cells near the base and corners of the epithelium (Fig. 3), where progenitor cells are localized. We performed double in situ hybridization to investigate whether the VNO-E lncRNA is in fact expressed in progenitor cells, using a probe for marker Ki67.73Ki67-positive cells are sparsely distributed along the base and corners of the VNO (Fig. 6), and a fraction of these co-express VNO-E overall, suggesting that this lncRNA is expressed in vomeronasal progenitors. Interestingly, it seems that the co-expression levels are more pronounced in Ki67 cells near the base as compared with the progenitor population at the VNO epithelium corners (Fig. 6), but the functional significance of this apparent difference remains to be determined.

DiscussionIn this study, we used a bioinformatics pipeline containing a novel machine-learning classifier tool to identify long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in whole-olfactory organ de novo transcriptome assemblies. We discovered a range of unannotated lncRNAs preferentially expressed in the olfactory organs, providing the first comprehensive report of lncRNAs in olfaction. We also performed differential expression and single-cell RNA-Seq analyses to gather spatial and temporal expression information. Selected lncRNA candidates were identified in mature olfactory sensory neurons, including one exquisite transcript that exhibits a striking punctate pattern in a subpopulation of these cells. Moreover, we identified transcripts expressed in olfactory progenitor cells. Our work will lay the foundation for future studies on the function of non-coding RNAs in olfaction.4.1. An improved bioinformatics pipeline uncovers olfactory lncRNAsThe lncRNA classification model adopted in our study yields improved classification quality for the identification of lncRNAs over previously published tools (Fig. 1a and Table 1), because it uses a modern machine-learning algorithm and a novel set of features (Supplementary Fig. S10) not used in previously reported prediction algorithms (see Section 2 for details).Olfactory organs are unique from the molecular and cellular standpoints, and only few studies analysed high-throughput olfactory tissue transcriptomes. Only 1,301 out of the 10,158 lncRNA loci in this study have been annotated in the GENCODE’s M9 release reference mouse genome, and 4,624 have been annotated in the NONCODE v5 version (Supplementary Spreadsheet). Seven lncRNA candidates chosen for further investigation were previously categorized as non-coding transcripts in the GENCODE M9 mouse genome annotation, none of which has assigned biological function.74Our first-hand discovery of lncRNAs in the olfactory organs is relevant, because non-coding transcribed species have been shown to regulate chromatin state, leading to large-scale changes in transcriptional landscape,75 processes that take place during olfactory differentiation, for example as part of the regulation of olfactory receptor genes,12,17 one of the molecular hallmarks of sensory neuron differentiation. Therefore, the olfactory lncRNAs we describe here may help the identification of new molecular mechanisms in olfaction.4.2. Preferential expression of lncRNAs in the olfactory organsThe olfactory system displays striking molecular and functional characteristics, including the singular expression of receptor genes, which gives rise to a highly heterogeneous sensory epithelium, in contrast to the much more uniform nature of gene expression in other tissues. Therefore, it makes sense to look for molecular players preferentially or specifically expressed in these sensory structures.We discovered hundreds of lncRNA candidates preferentially expressed in the olfactory organs (VNOpref or MOEpref groups), or expressed in both organs relative to other mouse tissues (VNO+MOEpref). For several selected lncRNA candidates shown in silico to be expressed in one or both of the olfactory organs, confirmatory experiments were performed in situ (Figs 3, 5e, and 6). Some transcripts exhibited widely distributed expression across the sensory epithelium, whereas another exhibited expression in a restricted subpopulation of mature sensory cells (MOE-G), which is reminiscent of the punctate expression pattern of olfactory receptor genes, each of which is expressed in a limited subpopulation of sensory cells widely distributed across the olfactory organ.76,77 Finally, we found one exquisite transcript in the VNO, VNO-E, which is expressed in the little understood progenitor cells of that sensory organ.4.3. lncRNA expression in the olfactory organs is influenced by age, but not by genderThe VNO has long been recognized as a sensory organ that chiefly detects pheromones,11 substances released by an individual and received by other individuals of the same species, ultimately producing changes in behaviour. Sex pheromones are the most obvious examples, and numerous cases of gender-specific behaviours controlled by pheromones have been described, including the male’s gender discrimination of sexual partners60,62 and female lordosis sexual receptivity behaviour,64 to name just a few. Therefore, it seems conceivable that some olfactory genes expressed in the VNO would be gender-specific. However, over the years, it became apparent that gender-biased genes are not the norm.24 In agreement with these results, we could not find any lncRNAs differentially expressed between the sexes (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Supplementary Table S5).On the other hand, we found dozens of lncRNA candidates differentially expressed between adults and newborns (Fig. 5). The presence of age-biased transcripts could be due to several possible reasons, including differences in the cellular composition of the olfactory organs according to age, differences resulting from developmental mechanisms specific to either stage, or functional differences between the olfactory organs in adults and newborns. For example, some behaviours are exhibited differentially according to age, including suckling in juveniles, and nursing, infanticide, pup grooming, intermale aggression, and male and female sexual behaviours.60–62,64,78–82 It remains to be determined whether the age-biased lncRNAs identified here are involved simply with the control of olfactory organ development or with the regulation of genes related to olfactory stimulus detection and function.4.4. Single-cell RNA-Seq and differential expression analysis reveal lncRNAs expressed in mature olfactory sensory neuronsThe olfactory sensory epithelia are exposed to the environment and subject to chemical and biotic injury. To cope with the constant loss of neurons, the olfactory organs harbour permanent pools of stem and progenitor cells, which continuously replenish each organ with newly generated mature olfactory neurons.83 In the MOE, progenitor cells give rise to mature olfactory sensory neurons,72 and recent single olfactory neuron transcriptome analyses have shed light on the complex dynamics of gene expression along such differentiation process.71,84,85We used a combination of bulk RNA-Seq from whole MOE in adults and newborns and single-cell transcriptome analysis to discover 22 olfactory lncRNAs that are at the same time more highly expressed in adults (where the proportion of mature neurons is higher) and in OMP-expressing single cells (which marks mature olfactory neurons) (Fig. 5c). The expression of multi-exon lncRNA candidates fitting these criteria was confirmed in mature olfactory neurons by double in situ hybridization with probes for the lncRNA and OMP (Fig. 5e).Due to the role of lncRNAs in chromatin modification in other cell types,4 we hypothesize that these non-coding RNAs play a similar role in olfaction. One possibility is that they may participate in the regulation of olfactory neuron differentiation. Another exciting function for these non-transcribed species is that they may regulate olfactory receptor expression (singular gene choice) or olfactory detection in mature sensory neurons. We anticipate that the comprehensive list of lncRNA candidates and the validated transcripts we provide here will pave the road to better understand the molecular processes of olfaction.Ethics approval and consent to participateAnimals used in this study were obtained directly from our vivarium facility, and procedures were carried out in accordance with Animal Protocol no. 1883-1, approved on June 2009 by the Institute of Biology’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Committee for Ethics in Animal Use in Research), at the University of Campinas, or by animal protocol numbers 19/2013 and 60/2017 approved by the University of São Paulo Chemistry Institute’s IACUC.

IntroductionFlowering cherry, called sakura, is Japan’s unofficial national flower and is a popular ornamental tree in Japan and elsewhere. Cherry blossoms are symbols of spring, when blooming typically occurs. Accordingly, flowering cherries are important resources for the tourism industry in the spring season in Japan. More than 200 cultivars of flowering cherry are grown.1 The nomenclature and, in particular, the genus name (Prunus or Cerasus) has been under discussion. We use the genus name Cerasus in accordance with recent molecular and population genetic analyses.2 Most cultivars belong to a species complex with ten basic diploid founders (2n = 16), C. apetala, C. campanulata, C. incisa, C. jamasakura, C. leveilleana, C. maximowiczii, C. nipponica, C. sargentii, C. spachiana and C. speciosa. Recently, a new species, C. kumanoensis, has been described from Japan.3‘Somei-Yoshino’ (C. × yedoensis), also known as Yoshino cherry, is the most popular cultivar of flowering cherry. ‘Somei-Yoshino’ is believed to have been originated in a nursery in the Somei area of Edo (the former name of Tokyo), followed by its spread throughout Japan. ‘Somei-Yoshino’ is probably derived from an interspecific hybrid between two diploids (2n = 16),4,C. spachiana and C. speciosa.5–7 An alternative hypothesis is that ‘Somei-Yoshino’ arose from a cross between C. spachiana and a hybrid of C. jamasakura and C. speciosa.8 It is self-incompatible, like other members of the Rosaceae, and accordingly no seeds are produced by self-pollination. Even if self-pollinated seeds are obtained, genotypes would be segregated owing to the high heterozygosity. Therefore, ‘Somei-Yoshino’ is clonally propagated by grafting or cutting and distributed. The clonality is supported by DNA analyses.6,9 Thus, the taxonomic classification has been well investigated. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies of the molecular mechanism underlying flowering in flowering cherry to date, despite extensive analyses of other members of the Rosaceae.‘Some-Yoshino’ trees are used as standards for forecasting the flowering date of cherry blossoms in the early spring every year. Bud breaking and flowering are important and scientifically intriguing growth stages. In buds, the floral primordia are generally initiated in the summer (late June–August), after which the primordia start to differentiate into floral organs. After differentiation is completed, the buds enter a dormancy period during the winter. Recent studies have evaluated the molecular mechanisms underlying dormancy release as well as flowering in fruit tree species belonging to the Rosaceae.10,11 Phytohormones and transcriptional regulators involved in dormancy initiation and release have been characterized, including gibberellic acids (GAs) and abscisic acid (ABA). DELLA genes, containing a conserved DELLA motif involved in GA signalling, and CBF/DREB1 (C-repeat-binding factor/dehydration-responsive element-binding factor 1) genes involved in cold acclimation have been analysed in apple (Malus × domestica)12,13 and Japanese apricot (Prunus mume).14 The involvement of ethylene signalling, perhaps via crosstalk with ABA, has also been discussed based on a study of EARLY BUD-BREAK 1 (EBB1), which encodes an AP2 type/ethylene-responsive transcription factor.12,DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes in the same family as SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) genes,15,16,FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), encoding PEBP-like proteins involved in floral initiation and meristem development, are involved in dormancy.17 These previous studies provide insight into the genetic basis of dormancy and flowering in fruit tree species belonging to the Rosaceae.Genetic and genomic analyses are straightforward approaches to gain insights into the flowering mechanism in cherry blossoms. Whole genome sequences of >100 plant species have been published.18 Usually, the targets are haploids or inbred lines to simplify the genomic complexity. However, advanced long-read sequencing technologies and bioinformatics methods have made it possible to determine the sequences of complex genomes.19–21 For example, an assembly strategy for single-molecule real-time sequencing data has been developed to generate phased sequences in heterozygous regions of F1 hybrids.22 Furthermore, chromosome-scale phased genome assemblies for F1 hybrids have been obtained by linked read sequencing technology, providing long-range genome information,23 or by single-molecule real-time sequencing combined with Hi-C data.24,25 Haplotype-resolved sequences have been obtained for F1 cattle by a trio-binning strategy in which genome sequences with allelic variation are resolved before assembly.26In this study, to obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cherry blossom flowering, we conducted genome and transcriptome analyses of the interspecific hybrid ‘Somei-Yoshino’. The genome sequence of another interspecific hybrid flowering cherry, C. × nudiflora, formerly named Prunus yedoensis var. nudiflora,2 has been published.27 However, all genomic regions derived from the two different progenitor species (C. spachiana and C. jamasakura) are totally collapsed. Therefore, we established the phased genome sequence of C. × yedoensis, ‘Somei-Yoshino’, representing the two genomes of the probable progenitors (C. spachiana and C. speciosa). Using the genome sequences as a reference, a time-course transcriptome analysis of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ floral buds and flowers, with a special focus on dormancy and flowering-related genes, was also conducted to characterize the physiological changes during flowering.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA ‘Somei-Yoshino’ tree grown in Ueno Park (Tokyo, Japan) was used for genome assembly. This tree, i.e. #136, is presumed to be the original according to a polymorphism analysis of three genes and its location.7,28 In addition, 139 trees, including a ‘Somei-Yoshino’ clone maintained at Shimane University (SU), Shimane, Japan and five trees of wild species (C. campanulata, C. pseudocerasus, C. sargentii, C. speciosa and Padus grayana), were used for a clustering analysis (Supplementary Table S1). An F1 mapping population, YSF1, was produced by hand pollination between Yama-Zakura (C. jamasakura) and a clone of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ as a female and male parent, respectively, both of which are planted at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI), Chiba, Japan. The ‘Somei-Yoshino’ clones at SU and KDRI were used for the transcriptome analysis.2.2. Clustering analysis of genetically divergent cultivarsGenomic DNAs of the 139 trees were extracted from young leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and double-digested with the restriction enzymes PstI and EcoRI. ddRAD-Seq libraries were constructed as described previously29 and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000 (San Diego, CA, USA) to obtain 93 bp paired-end reads. Low-quality reads were trimmed using PRINSEQ v. 0.20.430 and adapter sequences were removed using fastx_clipper (parameter, -a AGATCGGAAGAGC) in FASTX-Toolkit v. 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit (9 July 2019, date last accessed)). The high-quality reads were mapped onto genome sequences of either sweet cherry (Cerasus avium; formerly named Prunus avium),31 Japanese apricot (P. mume)32 or peach (Prunus persica)33 using Bowtie2 v. 2.2.3.34 Biallelic SNPs were called from the mapping results using the mpileup command in SAMtools v. 0.1.19,35 and low-quality SNPs were removed using VCFtools v. 0.1.12b36 with the following criteria: including only sites with a minor allele frequency of =0.05 (--maf 0.05), including only genotypes supported by =5 reads (--minDP 5), including only sites with a quality value of =999 (--minQ 999) and excluding sites with =50% missing data (--max-missing 0.5). A dendrogram indicating a simple classification of the cultivars based on the SNPs was constructed using the neighbour-joining method implemented in TASSEL 537 and population structure was investigated using ADMIXTURE v. 1.3.0 with default settings (K = 1–20).382.3. Assembly of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genomeGenomic DNA was extracted from young leaves of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ tree #136 using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). A paired-end sequencing library (insert size of 500 bp) and three mate-pair libraries (insert sizes of 2, 5 and 8 kb) were constructed using the TruSeq PCR-free Kit (Illumina) and Mate-pair Kit (Illumina), respectively, and sequenced using the MiSeq and HiSeqX platforms (Illumina). The size of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome was estimated using Jellyfish v. 2.1.4.39 High-quality reads after removing adapter sequences and trimming low-quality reads as described above were assembled using SOAPdenovo2 v. 1.1040 (parameter: -K 121). Gaps, represented by Ns in the sequence, were filled with high-quality paired-end reads using GapCloser v. 1.1040 (parameter: -p 31). The resultant sequences were designated CYE_r1.0.High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from young leaves of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ tree #136 using Genomic Tip (Qiagen) to prepare the SMRTbell library (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA). The sequence reads obtained from the PacBio Sequel system were assembled using FALCON-Unzip22 to obtain an assembly, CYE_r2.0. Furthermore, the PacBio reads were divided into two subsets using the TrioCanu module of Canu v. 1.7,26 in which Illumina short reads of two probable ancestors of ‘Somei-Yoshino’, i.e. C. spachiana ‘Yaebeni-shidare’ and C. speciosa Ohshima-zakura, were employed. Each subset of data was assembled and polished using FALCON assembler v. 2.1.2,41 in which parameters were: pa_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -e0.75 -M24 -l1500 -k14 -h70 -w8 -s100 -t14; and ovlp_HPCdaligner_option = -v -B128 -M24 -k24 -h1024 -e.96 -l2500 -s100. The two assemblies were designated CYEspachiana_r3.0 and CYEspeciosa_r3.0, and were combined to obtain CYE_r3.0, representing the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome. Assembly completeness was evaluated using BUSCO v. 3.0.2,42 for which Plants Set was employed as data sets, and a mapping rate analysis of whole genome sequence data for ‘Somei-Yoshino’ reads to the references was performed (see below for details).2.4. Genetic map construction and pseudomolecule establishmentGenomic DNA was extracted from the ovules of YSF1 seeds using the Favorgen Plant Kit (Ping-Tung, Taiwan) and digested with PstI and EcoRI to construct the ddRAD-Seq library. The library was sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform. High-quality reads were mapped onto CYEspaciana_r3.0 and CYEspeciosa_r3.0 using Bowtie2 v. 2.2.3.34 Biallelic SNPs were called from the mapping results using the mpileup command in SAMtools v. 0.1.19,35 and low-quality SNPs were deleted using VCFtools v. 0.1.12b36 with the criteria used for the clustering analysis described above. The SNPs from the two references were merged, grouped and ordered using Lep-Map3 v. 0.2.43 Flanking sequences of the SNP sites (100 bases up- and downstream of the SNPs) were compared with the genome sequence of sweet cherry, PAV_r1.0,31 by BlastN with a cutoff value of 1E-40. Probable misassemblies found in the mapping process were broken, and the resultant sequence set was designated CYE_r3.1. According to map positions, the CYE_r3.1 sequences were oriented and assigned to the genetic map of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ to establish pseudomolecule sequences. Sequence variation between the two pseudomolecule sequences, CYEspaciana_r3.1 and CYEspeciosa_r3.1, was detected using the show-snps function of MUMMER v. 3.23,44 for which outputs from NUCmer were employed. In parallel, the genome structure of CYE_r3.1_pseudomolecule was compared with those of sweet cherry, peach, Japanese apricot and apple using D-GENIES.452.5. Gene prediction and annotationTotal RNA was extracted from 12 stages of buds within 1 month in 2017 as well as from leaves, stems, sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced by MiSeq. The obtained reads were mapped to the CYE_r3.1 sequences to determine gene positions using TopHat2 v. 2.0.14.46 The positional information was used in BREAKER2 v. 2.1.047 to gain training data sets for AUGUSTUS v. 3.348 and GeneMark v. 4.33.49 The two training sets and a preset of SNAP v. 2006-07-28 for Arabidopsis as well as peptide sequences of sweet cherry (v1.0.a1), peach (v2.0.a1) and apple (GDDH13 v1.1) registered in the Genome Database for Rosaceae50 and those of Japanese apricot32 were analysed using MAKER pipeline v. 2.31.1051 to predict putative protein-coding genes in the CYE_r3.1 sequences. Genes annotated using Hayai-Annotation Plants v. 1.052 (with a sequence identity threshold of 80% and query coverage of 80%) were selected as a high-confidence gene set.2.6. Gene clustering, multiple sequence alignment and divergence time estimationPotential orthologues were identified from genes predicted in seven genomes (two genomes of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ and one each of sweet cherry, Japanese apricot, peach and apple, as well as Arabidopsis as an outgroup) using OrthoMCL v. 2.0.9.53 The single copy orthologues in the seven genomes were used to generate a multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE v. 3.8.31,54 in which indels were eliminated by Gblocks v. 0.91b.55 A maximum-likelihood algorithm based phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary process of the species was constructed from the alignments with the Jones–Taylor–Thornton model in MEGA X v. 10.0.5.56 The divergence time was calculated using MEGA X v. 10.0.556 assuming that the divergence time between apple and peach was ~34 to 67 MYA in TIMETREE.572.7. Repetitive sequence analysisA database of repeat sequences of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome was established using RepeatModeler v. 1.0.11.58 The repeat database as well as that registered in Repbase59 was used to predict repetitive sequences in CYE_r3.1 using RepeatMasker v. 4.0.7.602.8. Whole genome resequencing analysisGenomic DNA of eight representative trees of the SU collection and one of the parental trees of the mapping population, ‘Yama-Zakura’, were digested with NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for whole genome shotgun library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq PCR-free Kit. The sequences were determined on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Read trimming, read mapping to the CYE_r3.1 sequence and SNP identification were performed as described above. Effects of SNPs on gene functions were evaluated using SnpEff v. 4.2.612.9. Transcriptome analysisAdditional RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from buds at 24 stages collected in 2017 at KDRI and in 2014 and 2015 at SU using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the NextSeq500 (Illumina). High-quality reads after removing adapter sequences and trimming low-quality reads as mentioned above were mapped to the pseudomolecule sequences of CYE_r3.1 using HISAT2 v. 2.1.0,62 and reads on each gene model were quantified and normalized to determine FPKM values using StringTie v. 1.3.563 and Ballgown v.2.14.164 in accordance with the protocol paper.65 The R package WGCNA v.1.6666 was used for network construction and module detection.3. Results3.1. Clustering analysis of cherry cultivarsWe obtained ~1.9 million (M) high-quality reads per line after trimming adapters and low-quality sequences from the ddRAD-Seq library. The reads were mapped onto the genome sequences of sweet cherry (PAV_r1.0), Japanese apricot and peach (v1.0) with mapping alignment rates of 70.8%, 77.8% and 68.7%, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). We detected 46,278 (sweet cherry), 31,973 (Japanese apricot) and 33,199 (peach) high-confidence SNPs. A clustering tree based on the 46,278 SNPs and a population structure analysis indicated that the cherry collection consisting of 139 trees was derived from at least eight founders (K = 8) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The result suggested that the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome consisted of C. spachiana and C. speciose genomic features.3.2. Assembly of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genomeThe ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome size was estimated by a k-mer analysis with 14.3 Gb of paired-end reads (20.7×) obtained by MiSeq (Supplementary Table S3). The distribution of distinct k-mers (k = 17) showed two peaks at multiplicities of 18 and 37, indicating heterozygous and homozygous regions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). This result suggested that the heterozygosity of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome was high. In other words, ‘Somei-Yoshino’ is likely an interspecific hybrid harboring components of two different genomes. The total size of the two genomes was ~690 Mb.Totals of 132.5 Gb of paired-end reads (192× genome coverage) and 69.1 Gb of mate-pair data (100×) (Supplementary Table S3) were assembled into 1.2 million scaffold sequences. The total length of the resultant scaffolds, i.e. CYE_r1.0, was 686.9 Mb, including 63.6 Mb of Ns with an N50 length of 142.5 kb (Supplementary Table S4). Only 62.3% of complete single copy orthologues in plant genomes were identified in a BUSCO analysis (Supplementary Table S4). Paired-end reads of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ (20.7×) were mapped onto CYE_r1.0 with a mapping rate of 76.6%. We found that 82.4% of SNPs were homozygous for the reference type. Ideally, both rates should be close to 100% if the assembly was fully extended and the two genomes were separated, or phased. Distributions of the sequence depth of coverage showed a single peak at the expected value of 21× (Supplementary Fig. S3). When we mapped the reads to the sequence of C. × nudiflora (Pyn.v1),27 two peaks at 22× (expected) and 44× (double the expected value) were observed (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating a mixture of phased and unphased sequences.To extend the sequence contiguity and to improve the genome coverage, PacBio long-read technology was employed to obtain 37.3 Gb of reads (54×) with an N50 read length of 17 kb (Supplementary Table S3). The long reads were assembled using FALCON-Unzip into 3,226 contigs [470 primary contigs (488 Mb) and 2,756 haplotigs (116 Mb)] spanning a total length of 605.4 Mb with an N50 length of 2.3 Mb, i.e. CYE_r2.0 (Supplementary Table S4). A BUSCO analysis indicated that 97.0% of complete BUSCOs (9.1% single copy and 87.9% duplicated, as expected) were represented in the assembly (Supplementary Table S4). The mapping rate of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ reads was 95.3%, and 97.1% of SNPs were homozygous for the reference type. Most of the sequences were phased, with one major peak of genome coverage at 21× (Supplementary Fig. S3); however, the total length was 13% shorter than the estimated size and no haplotype information was available.We used a trio-binning approach to obtain the entire sequences of the two haplotype sequences. The long reads (37.3 Gb, 54×) were divided into two subsets based on whole genome resequencing of the two trees, i.e. Cerasus_1-43 (C. spachiana, ‘Yaebeni-shidare’) and Cerasus_1-71 (C. speciose, Ohshima-zakura). The resultant subsets included 18.9 and 18.2 Gb for C. spachiana and C. speciosa, respectively, and 0.3 Mb of unassigned reads. The subsets were separately assembled to obtain 2,281 contigs (717 primary contigs and 1,564 associated contigs including duplicated repetitive sequences) covering 350.1 Mb, i.e. CYEspachiana_r3.0, and 2,271 contigs (800 primary contigs and 1,471 associated contigs) covering 340.0 Mb, i.e. CYEspeciosa_r3.0 (Supplementary Table S4). The total sequence (i.e. CYE_r3.0) spanned 690.1 Mb and consisted of 4,552 contigs with an N50 length of 1.0 Mb (Supplementary Table S4). The complete BUSCO score for CYE_r3.0 was 96.8% (10.6% single copy and 86.2% duplicated, as expected), while those for CYEspachiana_r3.0 and CYEspeciosa_r3.0 were 90.9% (69.3% single copy and 21.6% duplicated) and 88.9% (72.1% single copy and 16.8% duplicated), respectively (Supplementary Table S4). The mapping rate of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ reads was as high as 96.3%, and 96.2% of SNPs were homozygous for the reference type. The sequence depth of coverage was distributed as expected, with a single peak at 20× (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, the mapping rate of the ddRAD-Seq reads of the 139 trees was improved to be 90.2% (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, CYE_r3.0 was used for further analyses because it satisfied all of the established criteria.3.3. Genetic map for ‘Somei-Yoshino’Approximately 2.0 million high-quality ddRAD-Seq reads per sample were obtained from YSF1 and mapped to either CYEspachiana_r3.0 or CYEspeciosa_r3.0 with alignment rates of 79.3% and 80.3%, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). We detected 16,145 and 17,462 SNPs from the alignments with the references of CYEspachiana_r3.0 and CYEspeciosa_r3.0, respectively. Of these, 23,532 heterozygous SNPs in ‘Somei-Yoshino’ were used for a linkage analysis. The SNPs were assigned to eight groups and ordered, covering 458.8 cM with 16,933 SNPs in 694 genetic bins (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). The map was split into two for CYEspachiana_r3.0 and CYEspeciosa_r3.0, covering 448.9 cM with 8,280 SNPs (628 genetic bins) and 446.3 cM with 8,653 SNPs (645 genetic bins), respectively. The genetic bins were common for 579 loci on the two maps, suggesting that the sequences in the common bins were the same loci. A comparison of the genetic maps with the genome sequence of sweet cherry, PAV_r1.0 (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicated a high similarity of the genome structures in the two species.3.4. Genetic anchoring of the assemblies to the chromosomesIn the genetic mapping process, we found 19 potential misassemblies in 18 contig sequences of CYE_r3.0. The contigs were broken between SNPs mapped to different linkage groups. Finally, we obtained 4,571 contigs with an N50 length of 918.2 kb and the same total length (690.1 Mb). This final version of contigs was named CYE_r3.1, consisting of CYEspachiana_r3.1 (2,292 contigs, N50 length of 1.2 Mb) and CYEspeciosa_r3.1 (2,279 contigs, N50 length of 800.6 kb) (Table 1). Of these, 184 CYEspachiana_r3.1 contigs (221.8 Mb) and 262 CYEspeciosa_r3.1 contigs (199.2 Mb) were assigned to the genetic maps (Supplementary Table S8). The contigs were connected with 10,000 Ns to establish the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ pseudomolecule sequences consisting of 4,571 contigs covering 418 Mb. The structures of the two pseudomolecule sequences were well conserved with a few exceptions in chromosomes 2, 4 and 5 (Fig. 1). We observed 2,371,773 and 2,392,937 sequence variants, including SNPs and indels, in CYEspachiana_r3.1 (one variant every 93 bp) and CYEspeciosa_r3.1 (one variant every 83 bp), respectively, of which 0.4% were deleterious mutations (Supplementary Table S9). The structure of the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome showed high synteny with the genomes of other members of Rosaceae (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Gene prediction and annotationWe initially predicted 222,168 putative genes using the MAKER pipeline. All genes were annotated by a similarity search against the UniProtKB database using the Hayai-Annotation Plants pipeline to select 94,776 non-redundant high-confidence genes. Then, 300 genes showing sequence similarity to genes involved in flowering and dormancy in the Rosaceae (Supplementary Table S10) were manually added. A total of 95,076 genes (48,280 and 46,796 from CYEspachiana_r3.1 and CYEspeciosa_r3.1, respectively) were selected as a high-confidence gene set for CYE_r3.1 (Table 1), preferentially located on the distal ends of the pseudomolecule sequences (Fig. 1). The total length of the coding sequences was 91.9 Mb (13.3% of the CYE_r3.1) with an N50 length of 1,512 bases and a GC content of 44.8%. This gene set included 94.9% complete BUSCOs (12.8% single copy and 82.1% duplicated). Out of the 95,076 genes, 26,463 (27.8%), 34,996 (36.8%) and 46,502 (48.9%) were assigned to Gene Ontology slim terms in the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories, respectively. Furthermore, 3,972 genes had enzyme commission numbers.We found two pairs of self-incompatible genes, S determinants for pollen (S-RNase) and pistils (SFB: S haplotype-specific F-box); CYE_r3.1SPE0_g058440.1 (S-RNase) and CYE_r3.1SPE0_g058430.1 (SFB) were S genes of the PyS1 haplotype, and CYE_r3.1SPE0_g046700.1 (S-RNase) and CYE_r3.1SPE0_g046660.1 (SFB) were S genes of PyS2. For dormancy, we detected a cluster of six DAM-like genes, as reported in the Japanese apricot genome,32 in the pseudomolecule sequence of SPA1 (CYE_r3.1SPA1_g039840.1 to CYE_r3.1SPA1_g039890.1). In addition, CBF gene clusters were also found in SPA5 (CYE_r3.1SPA5_g014520.1 to CYE_r3.1SPA5_g014610.1) and SPE5 (CYE_r3.1SPE5_g016380.1 to CYE_r3.1SPE5_g016430.1).3.6. Gene clustering and divergence time of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ ancestorsThe 95,076 predicted genes were clustered with those of apple, sweet cherry, Japanese apricot, peach and Arabidopsis to obtain 29,091 clusters, involving 36,396 and 35,559 genes from CYEspachiana_r3.1 and CYEspeciosa_r3.1, respectively (Supplementary Table S11). While 15,849 clusters including 29,251 and 29,020 genes of CYEspachiana_r3.1 and CYEspeciosa_r3.1, respectively, were shared with the two ancestor genomes (namely, core gene clusters), 4,083 (7,145 genes of CYEspachiana_r3.1) and 3,558 (6,539 genes of CYEspeciosa_r3.1) clusters were generated in only one genome (i.e. genome-specific gene clusters). The remaining 5,601 clusters were absent from the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome but presented in either the five members.However, 8,125 clusters were common across the seven tested genomes, and 1,254 clusters consisting of one gene from each genome were selected for divergence time estimation. When the divergence time between apple and peach was set to 34– 67 MYA,57 the divergence time between the two haplotype sequences of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ was set to 5.52 MYA (Fig. 2).

Divergence times (MYA; million years ago) between branches are shown.3.7. Repetitive sequence analysisA total of 293.3 Mb (42.5%) of CYE_r3.1 (690.1 Mb) was identified as repetitive sequences, including transposable elements (Supplementary Table S12), which occupied 142.9 Mb (40.8%) and 150.4 Mb (44.2%) of CYEspachiana_r3.1 and CYEspeciosa_r3.1, respectively. The most prominent repeat types were long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (104.0 Mb; 14.1%), e.g. Gypsy- and Copia-types, followed by DNA transposons (65.1 Mb; 8.8%). While the DNA transposons were distributed over the genome evenly, the retroelements were located in the middle of the chromosomes where are probably centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin regions (Fig. 1). The retrotransposon-rich regions were corresponded to the disrupted regions of chromosomes 2, 4 and 5 in the synteny analysis (Fig. 1).3.8. Whole genome resequencing analysisApproximately 136 million high-quality whole genome sequence reads was obtained from eight representatives in a population structure analysis (Supplementary Table S13) and the parents of the mapping population, Yama-Zakura and ‘Somei-Yoshino’. In addition, 250 million sequence reads of C. × nudiflora27 (SRA accession number SRX3900230) was also employed. The reads were aligned to CYE_r3.1 as a reference with a mapping rate of 88.0%, on average. From the alignment data, we detected 2,307,670 SNPs and 169,664 indels, including 658,873 SNPs and 42,286 indels (28.3%) in CYEspachiana_r3.1 and 1,648,797 SNPs and 127,378 indels (71.7%) in CYEspeciosa_r3.1. Of these, 8,872 SNPs (0.4%) were deleterious mutations (Supplementary Table S14).In Somei-Yoshino, the reads were evenly mapped to the references of CYEspachiana_r3.1 (48.7%) and CYEspeciosa_r3.1 (47.6%) (Supplementary Fig. S6). Most of the loci (94.5% of SNPs in CYEspachiana_r3.1 and 96.9% in CYEspeciosa_r3.1) were homozygous for the reference type, as expected (Supplementary Fig. S7). Only 61.7% and 52.9% of SNPs in C. × nudiflora were reference-type homozygotes on CYEspachiana_r3.1 and CYEspeciosa_r3.1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6), and read mapping rates were 52.2% (CYEspachiana_r3.1) and 39.8% (CYEspeciosa_r3.1) (Supplementary Fig. S7).In Cerasus_1-43 (C. spachiana, ‘Yaebeni-shidare’), 69.8% of the reads were preferentially mapped to CYEspachiana_r3.1 (Supplementary Fig. S6), and 80.1% of SNPs detected in CYEspachiana_r3.1 were homozygous for the reference type (Supplementary Fig. S7). In Cerasus_1-71 (C. speciose, Ohshima-zakura), 61.1% of reads were mapped to CYEspeciosa_r3.1 (Supplementary Fig. S6) and 73.5% of SNPs in CYEspeciosa_r3.1 were homozygous for the reference type (Supplementary Fig. S7). In the remaining seven cultivars, mapping rates on CYEspeciosa_r3.1 were higher than those on CYEspachiana_r3.1, as in Cerasus_1-71 (C. speciose, Ohshima-zakura) (Supplementary Fig. S6).3.9. Transcriptome analysis of flowering datesRNA-Seq reads were obtained from 12 stages of buds collected every month from May 2014 to April 2015 (Supplementary Table S15) as well as from the 12 stages from 2 to 34 days before anthesis in 2017 used for gene prediction. After trimming, the reads as well as those for the six organs used in the gene prediction analyses were mapped to CYE_r3.1 with a mapping rate of 67.6%, on average. Among the 95,076 predicted genes, 72,248 (76.0%) with a variance across samples of =1 were selected. A WGCNA analysis was performed with the expression data for the 24 buds to generate 31 highly co-expressed gene clusters, referred to as modules (Supplementary Fig. S8). The modules were roughly grouped into three main classes expressed in the previous year of flowering, within 1 month, and within 1 week (Supplementary Fig. S9). There were no significant differences in expression patterns of genes of the core and genome-specific clusters (Supplementary Table S16).Based on the literature and databases for Rosaceae, we identified dormancy- and flowering-associated genes [i.e. DELLA, CBF/DREB1, EBB1, DAM (SVP), FT and CEN/TFL1 genes]. We detected 35 predicted genes in the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome, 16 of which were expressed in =1 sample. The expression patterns basically agreed with those of the modules and could be roughly classified into five groups (Fig. 3). The first group (blue and magenta gene modules in Supplementary Fig. S8) consisted of four genes homologous to DELLA genes. Their expression levels were elevated in the floral buds ~1 month before anthesis; expression was also observed in young vegetative buds. The second group (turquoise, brown and salmon gene modules) was highly expressed in the summer and autumn (from July to November) in the floral buds. Six genes homologous to CBF/DREB1 belonged to this group; however, these were classified into three different clusters on the dendrogram. The third group (turquoise gene module) consisted of two EBB1 homologues and one DAM (SVP) homologue; these genes were highly expressed in the autumn and winter (from October to December). In the fourth group (turquoise gene module), genes were highly expressed in the winter 2–3 months before anthesis and were homologous to FT genes. The fifth group (red gene module) solely included CEN/TFL1-like genes specifically expressed in vegetative state buds before flower differentiation.

DiscussionWe obtained the genome sequence of the flowering cherry ‘Somei-Yoshino’. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a phased genome sequence of an interspecific hybrid in the Rosaceae or in the kingdom of Plantae, broadly, although genome sequences have been reported for several species belonging to Rosaceae.50 Although the genome of another interspecific hybrid cherry flower, C. × nudiflora, has been reported,27 the two homoeologous ancestral genomes (C. spachiana and C. jamasakura) are totally collapsed, as indicted by the double peaks of sequence depth (Supplementary Fig. S3), resulting in a short assembly size (323.8 Mb). The genome complexity of interspecific hybrids could be compared with those of polyploids and highly heterozygous species. Genome sequences of polyploids and F1 hybrids have been obtained22,23 by single-molecule real-time sequencing technology, linked read sequencing, optical maps and Hi-C.19–21 These technologies to obtain phased genome assemblies are limited by haplotype switching,25 where two haplotypes are patched to make mosaic genome sequences.We employed the trio-binning technique26 to determine haplotype phases before assembly. This technique was initially developed to construct phased genome sequences of an F1 hybrid between cattle subspecies. Since sequence reads of two sub-genomes were divided into two subsets according to the sequences of the parents, haplotype switching is avoidable. We applied the trio-binning technique to the interspecific hybrid cherry tree. We verified the quality and accuracy of the resultant assembly, CYE_r3.0, by a BUSCO analysis (Supplementary Table S4), the mapping rates of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ reads and ddRAD-Seq reads of the 139 trees to the assemblies (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S2), and SNP genotypes detected in the mapping results. In addition, the genetic map (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7) and a comparative analysis of the pseudomolecule sequences between the two phased sequences and to those of Rosaceae (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs S4 and S5) also supported the quality and accuracy of the assembly. The results of this study suggested that the trio-binning strategy is useful for determining phased genome sequences for highly heterozygous genomes of interspecific hybrids.Our genome data provided insight into the progenitors of ‘Somei-Yoshino’. Our results were consistent with the conclusions of Baek et al.,27 who found that ‘Somei-Yoshino’, C. × yedoensis, is distinct from a variety in Jeju Island, Korea, C. × nudiflora. In this study, a population structure analysis suggested that ‘Somei-Yoshino’ was established by two founders, C. spachiana and C. speciosa (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S1), as suggested in previous studies.5,6 In a whole genome resequencing analysis, sequence reads of Cerasus_1-43 (C. spachiana, ‘Yaebeni-shidare’) were preferentially mapped to SPA sequences (Supplementary Fig. S6), and genotypes of most SNPs were homozygous for the reference type (Supplementary Fig. S7). This suggested that the sequence similarity of C. spachiana ‘Yaebeni-shidare’ and CYEspachiana_r3.1 was high and therefore that C. spachiana can be a candidate parent. While reads of Cerasus_1-71 (C. speciose, Ohshima-zakura) were mapped to CYEspeciosa_r3.1 sequences (Supplementary Fig. S6), the frequency of SNP genotypes homozygous for the reference type was not as high as that for Cerasus_1-43 (C. spachiana, ‘Yaebeni-shidare’) (Supplementary Fig. S7). This observation might suggest that C. speciosa is not an actual parent of ‘Somei-Yoshino’8; however, more individual trees of C. spachiana and C. speciose should be tested to verify the hypotheses. ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome data can be used in future studies of the origin to determine the most likely parents.In the clustering analysis, we used SNPs detected from ddRAD-Seq reads mapped on the sweet cherry genome sequence. This result could be improved by using the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome sequence as a reference, in which mapping rate was certainly risen up to 90.2% (Supplementary Table S2). Further improvement could be achieved with more trees to cover broaden genetic diversity of flowering cherries including multiple individuals of a single species and distant relatives. In the current dendrogram (Supplementary Fig. S1), distant species, e.g. C. campanulata, C. pseudocerasus, C. avium and P. grayana, belonged to a single class. This result disagreed with the actual taxonomy classification.8 This bias would be caused by the elimination of rare alleles mostly observed in the few distant species out of the tested plants, since we set the minor allele frequency of 5% as a cut-off value. This threshold value is often used in population genetics,37 but might lead mis-classification of cultivated and domesticated organisms, which are often generated by interspecific hybridizations. Indeed, flowering cherry cultivars also potentially include interspecific hybrids, which origins have been sometimes unknown.2 Adequate compositions of genome admixture proportions based on prior knowledge on the materials could break this limitation.We obtained a number of predicted genes. Transcriptome data for the developing bud provided a comprehensive overview of genes expressed during dormancy and flowering processes (Fig. 3). Our analysis was based on previous studies of key genes and fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying dormancy.10,11 Despite some discrepancies, the gene expression patterns observed in our study were generally consistent with previously observed patterns in deciduous fruit tree species in Rosaceae, suggesting that the transcriptome data from this study might be reliable even though biological and technical replicates were lacked. The relatively high expression levels of DELLA genes observed at 1 month before anthesis corresponded to the time at which the bud typically transitions from endodormancy to ecodormancy.14 GA signalling may reactivate bud development internally at the ecodormancy stage.67 The relatively high expression levels of CBF/DREB1 in the summer and decreased expression levels towards the winter is consistent with a role in cold acclimation, as previously reported in almond.68 We detected one DAM gene that was highly expressed in dormant buds in the winter, in agreement with previous reports69; however, two EBB1 genes, assigned to the same module as DAM genes, showed different expression patterns from those in apple and poplar, in which the genes exhibit sharp increases in expression before bud breaking.12,13 This inconsistency may be explained by differences in regulatory mechanisms underlying bud breaking. FT genes showed elevated expression levels in buds in February, when endodormancy is almost completed. In addition to the function of floral induction, unknown functions of FT genes during dormancy are possible. Interestingly, transgenic plum (Prunus domestica) with overexpressed poplar FT (PtFT1) does not enter a state of endodormancy upon cold treatment or, alternatively, has no chilling requirement after dormancy is established.70 Further studies of the role of FT genes in dormancy are needed. CEN/TFL1 was highly expressed only in vegetative buds before floral initiation. This observation was consistent with other previous results for species in the Rosaceae.71,72 Our transcriptome data for flowering cherry successfully revealed the comprehensive changes in gene expression during floral bud development towards flowering. The expression patterns of above genes in this study and supposed regulation network for dormancy release of woody plants10,73,74 are jointly summarized in Supplementary Fig. S10. The transcriptome data set provides a basis for further research aimed at identifying additional genes involved in floral bud development and flowering. Especially, identifying genes involved in the regulation of flowering under FT gene (protein) signalling and GA signalling processes is intrigued, and those may be able to utilize for accurate forecasting the flowering date of cherry blossoms.The genome and transcriptome data obtained in this study are expected to accelerate genomic and genetic analyses of flowering cherry. Owing to the complicated genomes, it is necessary to build additional de novo assemblies for divergent flowering cherries, which is a challenging task. Genome-graph-based pan-genome analyses could be used to characterize the complex genomes.75 The ‘Somei-Yoshino’ genome sequence would be a resource for the flowering cherry pan-genome analyses. It may provide insights into the evolution and cultivation of flowering cherry as well as the molecular mechanism underlying flowering traits in the species and in the Rosaceae, and it may guide the future cultivation and breeding of flowering cherry.We thank Ueno Park (Tokyo, Japan) for providing the ‘Somei-Yoshino’ sample.

IntroductionNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of genomics,1,2 as it has much higher throughput (thus much lower cost) compared with traditional Sanger sequencing.3 The use of Illumina sequencing technology dominates the fields of bacterial genomics and metagenomics. Therein, library construction is an important process. While several library construction methods have been developed for Illumina sequencing,4,5 this process generally comprises three steps: DNA fragmentation, repairing and end-polishing of fragmented DNA, and ligation of platform-specific adaptors.6 Several library preparation kits are now commercially available, and they employ sonication or enzymatic digestion for DNA fragmentation. Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (XT), which employs a transposon to shear genomic DNA and simultaneously introduce adapter sequences,7 is an alternative approach for streamlining the workflow, improving turnaround time and reducing DNA input.In Illumina sequencing, extreme base composition, i.e. extremely GC-poor or rich sequences, has been reported to yield uneven or poor sequencing coverage.8–10 For example, Illumina sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum (mean GC; 19%) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (69%) favoured more GC-balanced regions and yielded fewer reads from regions of GC content at either extreme.11 Such a sequencing bias reduces the efficacy of data analyses; genome assembly,12,13 identification of sequence variations by read mapping,14,15 and estimation of the copy numbers of sequences of interests. Lower-coverage regions may lead to a failure to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic regions of functional or phylogenetical importance. Efforts to reduce gaps or low-coverage regions by obtaining more sequence reads inflate sequencing costs and may limit the effectiveness of genomic analyses, particularly, those aiming to analyse numerous samples. Thus, improving our knowledge of sequencing bias is essential to further improve the utility of sequencing by NGS.Uneven coverage associated with GC bias can be introduced during PCR amplification of library, cluster amplification, or sequencing. Among these, library amplification is known as a major source.16,17 The XT kit has been reported to introduce a substantial sequencing bias in Mycobacterium tuberculosis sequencing (mean GC; 66%)18 and yielded more unmapped open reading frames for Clostridium beijerinckii (30%) in a mock metagenome sample compared with other kits.19 We also found inefficiency issues in assembling Staphylococcus aureus genomes (33%) from Illumina reads obtained by XT. Because studies on sequencing bias have been conducted in limited strains or species, systematic investigation of bacteria with a wide GC content range is required to understand the factors that introduce sequencing bias. Different sequencing kits and protocols may also be differentially affected by GC bias. The resulting sequence bias also impairs interpretation of metagenome sequencing data, which include many unknown species, particularly in estimating the relative abundances of genes/species in a microbial community based on read counting. Therefore, in this study, we compared currently available library preparation kits for Illumina sequencing, including the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit recently released by Illumina, to examine what kinds and what levels of sequencing bias are generated by these kits across a wide range of bacterial species. The impacts of sequencing bias on metagenome analysis were also evaluated using a mock bacterial community comprising species with a wide range of GC content levels.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and genomic DNA preparationWe used two Escherichia coli strains, K-12 MG1655 and O157 Sakai, and two S. aureus strains, MW2 and N315, as model microbial organisms to analyse sequencing bias introduced by different library preparation kits (Supplementary Table S1). The complete genome sequences of these strains are available.20–23 In addition, 22 strains of non-S. aureus species in the genus Staphylococcus and seven species with various degrees of GC content from the strain collections of our laboratories were analysed (Supplementary Table S1). The E. coli strains were grown in Lysogeny broth (LB; Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, MD, USA) at 37°C. Genomic DNA was purified from 2 ml of overnight culture using a Genomic-tip 100/G and Genomic DNA buffer set (QIAGEN, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Staphylococcal strains were grown at 37°C overnight with shaking in 2-ml tryptic soy broth (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems), and genomic DNA was isolated as previously described.24 Briefly, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 500 µl of CS buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA), incubated sequentially with 20 µg/ml lysostaphin (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at 37°C and with 100 µg/ml Proteinase K and 1% SDS (both from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at 55°C for 2 h, and then subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The genomic DNA was finally cleaned up using a Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA). Among the seven species with various degrees of GC content, M. interjectum and M. malmoense were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) with albumin dextrose catalase enrichment. Tsukamurella pulmonis, Klebsiella aerogenes, Streptobacillus moniliformis, and Brachyspira pilosicoli were grown on sheep blood agar at 37°C, and Serratia liquefaciens was grown on LB agar at 37°C. Genomic DNA from these bacteria was prepared using a NucleoSpin Microbial DNA kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan).A mock microbial community DNA was composed of genomic DNA from E. coli MG1655, S. aureus N315, M. interjectum, M. malmoense, T. pulmonis, K. aerogenes, S. liquefaciens, S. moniliformis, and B. pilosicoli, representing an approximately equimolar mixture of these genomic DNAs.2.2. Genome sequences obtained from a public databaseThe genome sequencing data of 204 human pathogenic bacterial species were obtained from the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive database in fastq format. These strains were from the Gifu Type Culture (GTC) collection of Gifu University Center for Conservation of Microbial Genetic Resource (GCMR) and were sequenced by the National BioResource Project (NBRP) of Japan using an XT library preparation kit (Illumina, CA, USA) and the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Supplementary Table S1).2.3. Library preparation and sequencingEight sequencing library preparation kits were used in this study: XT, KAPA HyperPlus (NIPPON Genetics Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with PCR or PCR-free workflow (referred to as KP and KPF, respectively), NEBNext Ultra II (referred to as NN; New England Biolabs Japan, Tokyo, Japan), QIAseq FX (QS; QIAGEN), TruSeq nano (TS; Illumina), TruSeq DNA PCR-Free (TSF; Illumina), and Nextera DNA Flex (FL; Illumina) (Table 1). For XT, KP, NN, QS, and FL, 1 ng of DNA, measured by Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), was used for input DNA, and the number of PCR cycles was fixed at 12. These parameters were set according to the XT protocol, for which the amount of input DNA and the number of PCR cycles were essentially unable to be modified. For the TS library preparation, 200 ng of input DNA and eight PCR cycles were employed. For KPF and TSF, 1 µg of input DNA was used. Other procedures for library preparation were performed according to the recommended protocols of each kit. The prepared libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform with a paired-end (PE) 600-cycle mode (Reagent Kit v3). The XT libraries of the E. coli and S. aureus genomes were prepared independently three times from the same genomic DNA preparation to generate technical replicates. The sequencing reads have been deposited in DDBJ (accession number: PRJDB8030). Library preparation kits analysed in this studyLibrary preparation kits analysed in this study2.4. Genome assemblyPCR duplicates were removed by FastUniq,25 and adapter and low-quality sequences were trimmed by trim galore! v0.4.2 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) for all sequencing data. Trimmed reads from each sample were assembled using Velvet v1.2.10 and VelvetOptimiser v2.2.512 with k-mer lengths ranging from 19 to 199. Contigs shorter than 300 bp were excluded from this study. To compare the numbers of contigs obtained by the six library preparation kits under the same conditions (e.g. at the same sequencing depth), sequencing reads were randomly picked up from each of the four model genomes (two E. coli and two S. aureus genomes) to gain ×30 coverage, which was calculated based on the total genome length of each strain. This procedure was repeated ten times for each genome. The four model genomes were also assembled by SPAdes v3.9.013 with default parameters.2.5. Sequencing bias analysisInsert sizes of each library were calculated using Picard tools version 2.7.0 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), and jellyfish v2.2.626 was used to calculate the 30-mer frequency. Per-base coverage was computed by counting the reads mapped to a given base along the reference genome.11 We used bowtie214 and SAMtools27 for read mapping and counting the coverage of each base, respectively. As references, the published complete sequences were used for the four model genomes from E. coli and S. aureus, while draft sequences were used for others. The draft sequences were generated by merging and assembling sequencing reads obtained by all kits in each strain, and contigs shorter than N90 were excluded from the references because they might be derived from multicopy genetic elements. The qualities of the assemblies from 204 strains obtained from the NBRP data were assessed by checkM,28 and 13 genomes with low completeness (<85%) or high contamination (>5%) were excluded from this study (final n = 191).To evaluate coverage bias (a deviation from the uniform distribution of reads across the genome), we first calculated per-base relative coverage, which is the ratio of the coverage of a given reference base to the mean coverage across the genome.11 Then, ‘relative coverage’ was presented as the mean per-base relative coverage of each 200-bp window with no overlap.2.6. Digital droplet PCR and mock community analysisAccurate molecular ratios of the seven species in the pooled genomic DNA sample for the mock microbial community were determined by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) using ddPCR™ EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad, CA, USA) and species-specific primers (Supplementary Table S2), which were designed in the arginyl-tRNA synthetase gene, one of the universal single-copy genes. Droplets were generated using a QX200™ droplet generator (BioRad), and each ddPCR sample was composed of sample DNA, primers, and ddPCR super mix. PCR was performed with the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, and 58°C for 90 s, and a final incubation at 90°C for 5 min. The data were analysed by QuantaSoft version 1.7.4 (BioRad). The established copy numbers of each genome in the pooled DNA sample were used to normalize the relative abundance of genomic DNA and per-base coverage for each species within the mock microbial community.3. Results and discussion3.1. Comparison of six library preparation kits using E. coli and S. aureus as model bacterial genomesWe first used two E. coli and two S. aureus genomes as model genomes for comparing the quality of the libraries prepared by different library preparation kits. The six kits compared in this study cover three fragmentation strategies (Table 1): tagmentation by transposome (XT and FL), enzymatic fragmentation (KP, NN, and QS), and sonication (TS). FL utilizes improved tagmentation chemistry to obtain a uniform fragment size; KP, NN, and QS each use different enzymes for fragmentation.To assess the difference in the efficacy of sequence assembly between the kits, we first compared the number of contigs and L50 values of each assembly obtained by Velvet and SPAdes at the same sequencing depth (×30) (Fig. 1A). In E. coli, the number of contigs and L50 values exhibited some level of variation between the kits and between the strains and assemblers used. In contrast, the levels of sequence assembly of both S. aureus genomes obtained by XT were much lower than those obtained by other kits, regardless of which assembler was used. Analysis of k-mer frequencies in each read data set revealed that a sharp peak was observed in S. aureus data sets with the exception of the data set obtained by XT (Supplementary Fig. S1). This result suggests that the inefficient sequence assembly observed for the XT-derived S. aureus assemblies was caused by uneven genome sequencing. In fact, sequence coverage across the genome in each library assessed by calculating the relative coverage in every 200-bp window (see Materials and methods) revealed that the XT-derived assemblies of S. aureus genomes showed remarkably uneven coverage along the entire genome (Supplementary Fig. S2). Notable bias was also observed in the XT-derived assemblies of E. coli genomes but to a much lesser extent than in the S. aureus genomes. Quality comparison of E. coli and S. aureus genome assemblies obtained by library preparation kits. (A) Assembly statistics obtained by six library preparation kits were compared in E. coli and S. aureus. Two E. coli and two S. aureus genomes were analysed as model bacterial genomes to compare six library preparation kits. Illumina read sequences obtained from each library were assembled using Velvet and SPAdes, and the numbers of contigs and L50 values of each assembly are shown. In each sequence data set, assembly was repeated 10 times using Illumina reads randomly selected at 30× coverage. Error bars indicate standard deviations. The six kits used cover three fragmentation strategies (see the main text). XT, Nextera XT; FL, Nextera DNA Flex; KP, KAPA HyperPlus; NN, NEBNext Ultra II; QS, QIAseq FX; and TS, TruSeq nano. (B) Relative sequence coverage in relation to GC content was calculated in E. coli and S. aureus genomes obtained by three library preparation kits. Relative sequence coverage in the genome assemblies obtained by the XT, FL, and KP kits and GC content were calculated for every 200-bp window with no overlap. Only the first 120,000 bp regions of each genome are shown. (C) Relationships between GC content and sequence coverage in the E. coli and S. aureus genome assemblies obtained by six library preparation kits are shown. The relative abundance of 200 bp bins with a given GC content (defined by 0.5% interval) and the mean relative coverage of bins with a given GC content (<U+2060>CGC<U+2060>) were calculated and are shown along with GC content by black lines or lines coloured according to the library preparation kits, respectively. Black horizontal lines (<U+2060>CGC=1) represent unbiased coverage. The data for bins with extreme GC content (those representing <0.5% of all 200 bp bins) are not shown.

Color figures are available at DNARES online.Because sequencing bias associated with GC content has been reported for Illumina sequencing,8–10 we next investigated the relationship between relative coverage and GC content across the E. coli and S. aureus genomes (Fig. 1B). The results of this analysis clearly indicated that the variations in relative coverage in the XT libraries correlated well with the variations in GC content, particularly in the S. aureus genomes, with lower coverage in regions with lower GC content. In Fig. 1B, only the data for a 120-kb region in each genome are shown, but similar patterns were observed along the entire genome (data not shown). To quantitatively evaluate the level of GC content-associated sequencing bias at the whole-genome level, we calculated CGC<U+2060>, which represents the mean relative coverage of a 200-bp bin with a given GC content (see Materials and methods for more details), across the genome and analysed the GC content-associated variation in CGC in each library (Fig. 1C). This analysis revealed that in the XT libraries of S. aureus, CGC was drastically reduced as GC content decreased. A reduction in CGC was also observed in the XT libraries of E. coli, but only in the bins with lower GC content. In contrast, similar CGC values were observed in bins of all GC content values in the libraries prepared with the other five kits, including FL. We prepared XT libraries three times from all E. coli and S. aureus genomes and performed the same analyses as technical replicates. Although the results of E. coli libraries showed some variation between the samples, the results of S. aureus genomes were highly reproducible (Supplementary Fig. S3).All these results indicate that a notable GC content-associated sequencing bias in Illumina sequencing is introduced by XT, particularly in S. aureus genome sequencing.3.2. Sequencing bias in 22 strains from various species in the genus StaphylococcusTo examine whether the GC content-associated sequencing bias observed for XT is species-specific, we assessed the sequencing bias introduced by XT in other Staphylococcus species. We analysed 22 strains of 15 non-S. aureus species in the genus Staphylococcus (Supplementary Table S1). KP was used as a control kit. In all strains analysed, while CGC values in the KP libraries were nearly even regardless of the GC content (Supplementary Fig. S4), CGC in the XT libraries drastically decreased as GC content decreased, as seen in S. aureus.We quantified the overall GC content-associated sequencing bias by calculating the average deviation of CGC (see Materials and methods) and performed a linear regression analysis of the relationship between overall GC content-associated bias and mean GC content of each genome (Fig. 2). These analyses revealed that, in all strains, the overall sequencing bias was much higher in XT libraries than in KP libraries. Moreover, the levels of overall sequencing bias correlated well with the mean GC content of genomes, particularly in the XT libraries; the regression coefficients of XT and KP were -0.034 (P value = 0.0010) and -0.0067 (P value = 0.0005), respectively. These results indicated that the strong GC content-associated sequencing bias introduced by XT is common to the members of the genus Staphylococcus. Overall GC content-associated sequencing bias observed in 22 strains of non-S. aureus species in the genus Staphylococcus. Sequence reads were obtained from 22 strains of non-S. aureus species in the genus Staphylococcus using the XT and KP kits. The overall sequencing bias associated with GC content observed in the genome assemblies was quantified (see Materials and methods in the main text), and the relationships between the quantified overall sequencing bias and the mean GC content of each genome are shown. Solid lines indicate regression lines, and the 95% confidence intervals are indicated in grey.Overall GC content-associated sequencing bias observed in 22 strains of non-S. aureus species in the genus Staphylococcus.

Solid lines indicate regression lines, and the 95% confidence intervals are indicated in grey.3.3. Sequencing bias in 191 species representing a wide range of bacterial speciesWe further investigated the overall GC content-associated sequencing bias introduced by XT across a wide range of bacterial species using 191 genomes from various species in the GTC collection (one strain from each species), which were sequenced by NBRP of Japan. These species were from Proteobacteria (n = 90), Actinobacteria (n = 40), Bacteroidetes (n = 11), Firmicutes (n = 47), and three other phyla (n = 3) and had a wide range of genome sizes (1.5–6.4 Mb) and GC content (25.7–71.9%) (Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Fig. 3 (see Supplementary Fig. S5 for the data of each genome), although overall sequencing bias was observed in many species, a stronger bias was more frequently observed in the species with an extreme mean GC content. Particularly in low-GC species (<40%), stronger bias was observed in all genomes, and the levels of bias correlated with the levels of GC content, as seen in the genus Staphylococcus. In many species with higher GC content, particularly those with extremely high GC content (>65%), high levels of overall sequencing bias were also observed. In most of these species, CGC gradually decreased as the GC content increased, as opposed to the trend in low-GC species (see Supplementary Fig. S5). The results of this analysis indicated that XT introduces GC content-associated sequencing bias in a wide range of bacterial species, particularly those with extreme GC content, although sequencing bias in lower and higher GC regions may not be caused by the same mechanism. Overall GC content-associated sequencing bias in the sequence data of 191 species obtained by the XT library preparation kit. Illumina sequencing data for 191 species (one strain from each species) produced using the XT kit from a project of NBRP of Japan were downloaded from the public database (DDBJ). The overall GC content-associated sequencing bias in each data set was quantified, and relationships between the quantified overall sequencing bias and the mean GC content of each genome are shown.Overall GC content-associated sequencing bias in the sequence data of 191 species obtained by the XT library preparation kit.

Comparison of sequencing bias between the methods employing different fragmentation and amplification techniquesTo confirm the reproducibility of sequencing bias introduced by XT and to evaluate the effects of PCR amplification, we prepared genomic DNA from seven species that showed high levels of sequence bias in the analyses described above and prepared their sequencing libraries using four library preparation kits utilizing various fragmentation methods (XT, FL, KP, and TS) and two PCR-free kits (KPF and TSF). The seven analysed species were two low-GC species (B. pilosicoli and S. moniliformis), two intermediate-GC species (S. liquefaciens and K. aerogenes), and three high-GC species (M. malmoense, M. interjectum, and T. pulmonis). Analyses of the sequences obtained from each library revealed that strong GC content-associated sequencing bias was reproducibly observed in the XT libraries of the two low-GC species (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, strong bias was not observed in the XT libraries of the two intermediate-GC species, although some bias was introduced in low-GC regions. In the three high-GC species, some levels of GC content-associated sequencing bias were detected in the XT libraries, but the observed bias was not as strong as that in the data set produced by NBRP of Japan. Although the reason(s) for the stronger bias observed in the NBRP data set is unknown, several factors, such as the accuracy of quantification of input DNA and lengths of input DNA, might have affected the quality of these libraries prepared with XT.In the libraries prepared with other kits, including the recently released FL kit by Illumina, no strong bias was observed. Some GC content-associated sequencing bias was observed in the TS libraries of the two low-GC species (Supplementary Fig. S6), but no such bias was detected in the libraries prepared with TSF (PCR-free). This finding suggests that PCR amplification during library preparation can also introduce some levels of bias in low-GC regions. However, the effects are not as strong and are unlikely to cause serious problems in bacterial genome sequencing.3.5. Analysis of the mock microbial communityGC content-associated sequencing bias could be a more serious problem in metagenomics, where a wide range of microbial species with various degrees of GC content is sequenced. Therefore, we analysed the bias introduced in metagenome sequencing by XT and other kits (FL, KP, KPF, TS, and TSF) using a mock bacterial community DNA sample. The sample was composed of genomic DNA from the following nine bacteria: S. aureus (strain N315), E. coli (strain MG1655), and the seven species used in the analysis described above (Fig. 4). In the relative abundance analysis of the nine bacteria (Fig. 4A), the abundance of three low-GC species, S. aureus, B. pilosicoli, and S. moniliformis, in the XT library was remarkably lower than the expected values, which were calculated and normalized based on their molecular ratios in the sample examined. Furthermore, in relative coverage analysis within each genome, strong GC content-associated sequencing bias was evident not only in the three low-GC species but also in other species (Fig. 4B).

Color figures are available at DNARES online.Other kits, including FL, did not introduce the strong bias observed in the XT library. However, a notable bias was observed in the TS library at regions with extreme GC content. The bias introduced by TS was reproducibly detected in a separate experiment (Supplementary Fig. S7). Such a bias was not observed in the library prepared with TSF, which also employs sonication for fragmentation but does not include PCR amplification. This finding suggests that the bias observed in the TS libraries may be generated by a combination of some level of non-random DNA fragmentation during sonication and PCR amplification.3.6. Possible mechanisms to generate sequencing biasThe main mechanism to generate sequencing bias in XT libraries is probably uneven tagmentation affected by local GC-content, particularly AT-rich sequences, because the GC content-associated insertion bias of Tn5 transposase has been pointed out by several studies.29–31 It appears that less frequent insertion in GC-unbalanced regions than in balanced regions. As AT-richness increases, higher level of sequencing bias was observed in our data set. This observation suggests the gradual decrease in insertion frequency of Tn5 transposase according to the level of AT-richness, which resulted in the increase in sequencing bias in the genomes or genomic regions of bacterial strains with more extreme mean GC-contents as observed in the strains with <40% GC content. No clear difference was observed between KP and KPF libraries. However, it appears that PCR amplification during library preparation also has some contribution to bias generation because some bias was observed in the TS libraries of low GC species but not in their TSF libraries (Supplementary Fig. S6). When single genomes were analysed, the effect was not so prominent, and practically not problematic. However, in the analysis of bacterial community DNA, significant bias was introduced by TS but not TSF. This bias observed in the TS library may be generated by a combination of some level of non-random DNA fragmentation during sonication and PCR amplification. Importantly, the problem of strong sequencing bias due to uneven tagmentation has been solved in FL by employing bead-linked transposases and by some other modifications,32 although it is not open to users whether XT and FL use the same transposase or FL uses an improved enzyme.314. ConclusionBy systematic comparison of currently available library preparation kits for Illumina sequencing, we demonstrated that strong sequencing bias is introduced in low-GC regions by the Nextera XT kit. The level of bias introduced is dependent on the level of GC content; stronger bias is generated as the GC content decreases. More substantial GC content-associated sequencing bias was introduced by Nextera XT in metagenome sequencing of a mock bacterial community. Other kits, including the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit, a recently released kit from Illumina, did not introduce strong GC content-associated sequencing bias, but the TruSeq nano kit generated notable bias in regions with extreme GC content when used for metagenome sequencing. Our data indicate the importance of selecting proper library preparation kits according to the purposes and targets of genome sequencing, particularly sequencing of low-GC species and metagenome sequencing. Special attention should also be paid to which library preparation kit was used when analysing and interpreting publicly available data.The authors thank M. Horiguchi, M. Kumagai, Y. Nagayoshi, Y.

IntroductionResearch in genomics and genetics has accelerated molecular breeding strategies for several crop species. In particular, high-density genetic linkage maps are crucial tools for gene identification, quantitative trait locus (QTL) survey, comparative genomic analyses, and marker-assisted breeding programs. The polyploid nature of several crop species makes genetic linkage analysis difficult. Polyploidy exists in crops, such as potato (Solanum tuberosum; tetraploid, 4x), canola (Brassica napus; tetraploid, 4x), bread wheat (Triticum aestivum; hexaploid, 6x), sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.; hexaploidy, 6x], strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa; octaploid, 8x), and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.; 10x–12x). In general, genomic analyses in polyploid species can be performed by comparing the polyploid genome with a closely related diploid (2x) species.1–4 However, genetic linkage analyses of polyploid species are more complicated than those of diploids because more variations in allele dosage is apparent in polyploids. During linkage analyses, the marker dosage is based on the segregation ratios of the mapping population. Thus, we need to consider numerous variations of the segregation ratios in polyploids. Those variations can also be altered by cytological characteristics, such as auto or allopolyploidy. Therefore, genetic linkage analyses in polyploid species are still challenging, although there are several excellent papers achieving map-based cloning on the hexaploid wheat.5–9Sweetpotato is one of the most important crop species worldwide, and its global production exceeds 100 million tonnes.10 This crop contains valuable nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, and is widely cultivated in tropical and temperate regions. It is used in a wide range of goods, including processed foods, feeds, pigment materials, and ingredients of alcohol products. Thus, a growing demand for this crop indicates that the development of cultivars with disease and pest resistance is required to avoid commercial yield loss. However, genetic linkage analysis and marker-assisted breeding in sweetpotato have been challenging because of the complexity of its genomic architecture that comprises hexaploidy (2n = 6x = 90), high heterozygosity, a huge genome (approximately 2–3 Gb), and outcrossing nature.One of the important target traits in sweetpotato breeding is resistance to the southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita), which is a major pest that decreases yield and the quality of sweetpotato.11 The nematode invades roots, which results in the generation of spindle-shaped swellings (galls) on the fibrous roots and cracks on tuberous roots. In Japan, M. incognita can be found in most areas, including Kyusyu and Kanto, in which sweetpotato is cultivated.12–14 Previous studies have reported that at least nine races of M. incognita (SP1–SP9) exist in Japan, and certain races are dominant in specific regions.15 For example, the SP1 race is predominant in the Kumamoto, Nagasaki, and Saga Prefectures (Kyushu); in contrast, the SP4 and SP6 races are predominant in the Okinawa islands15 and are found in the Ibaraki and Chiba Prefectures (Kanto)16,17. Recently, Tabuchi et al.18 have reported that SP6 could be classified into two races (SP6-1 and SP6-2) and SP6-1 was identified in Chiba. Thus, the development of cultivars resistant to the multiple races of M. incognita is highly desirable.To date, several studies have reported about the construction of linkage maps in sweetpotato using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), sequence-related amplified polymorphism, simple sequence repeat (SSR), and retrotransposon-based markers.19–26 Moreover, Shirasawa et al.27 have established high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage maps in sweetpotato utilizing the next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. They performed double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) analysis in an S1 mapping population derived from the self-pollination of sweetpotato cultivar Xushu18, which produced 28,087 SNP markers mapped onto 96 linkage groups (LGs) covering a total distance of 33,020.4 cM. This study first constructed a high-density linkage map containing >10,000 markers in sweetpotato using NGS technology.In the present study, we performed linkage analysis to identify genomic regions controlling M. incognita resistance in sweetpotato. Our study focussed on the following three areas: (i) high-density linkage map construction using several kinds of molecular markers, including SSRs, retrotransposons, and SNPs, via ddRAD-seq analysis in F1 mapping populations derived from resistant and susceptible cultivars; (ii) identification of the genomic regions that control resistance to the several races of M. incognita (SP1, SP4, and SP6-1) by QTL mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS); and (iii) development of practical polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA markers for screening M. incognita-resistant plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsAn F1 mapping population comprising 113 progeny lines was constructed by crossing J-Red with Choshu cultivars. J-Red is an orange-fleshed sweetpotato cultivar, which contains high levels of ß-carotene and is highly resistant to most races of M. incognita, except SP8.15,18,28 In contrast, Choshu is a local cultivar that is susceptible to the M. incognita races, SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 SP6-1, and SP6-2.18 A total of 107 of 113 F1 progeny lines and two parental cultivars were used for M. incognita resistance testing and genetic analysis, because the remaining 6 lines withered after DNA extraction. The total DNA of the F1 lines and the parental cultivars was extracted from the leaves of plants using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Germany). DNA quantification and quality checks were performed using an ND1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA).2.2. Marker developmentSeveral types of DNA markers, including retrotransposon-based, SSR, and SNP markers, were developed to construct the linkage maps. To develop retrotransposon-based molecular markers, insertion sites for the active retrotransposon families, namely, Rtsp-129 and Cl8, were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing system. Cl8 was a novel retrotransposon family, which was identified using the method developed by Monden et al.30 We experimentally confirmed that these families exhibit high insertion polymorphisms among sweetpotato cultivars and achieved relatively high copy numbers in the sweetpotato genome.31 The method established by Monden et al.23 was used for developing retrotransposon-based DNA markers. First, genomic DNA of the F1 progeny lines and the parental cultivars was digested using gTUBE (Covaris Inc., MA, USA). Thereafter, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification of the insertion sites were performed using primers designed according to the retrotransposons and adaptors. PCR primers contained 5- or 7-bp barcode sequences for multiplexed sample analysis on the Illumina platform. The PCR library was gel-purified, and 400–600-bp fractions were selected using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The purified product was qualified and quantified using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer and Qubit@2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). The MiSeq sequencing library was prepared by pooling equal amounts of purified barcoded products from each F1 line. The 150 bp of paired-end reads that were obtained were analysed using Maser, which is a pipeline execution system of the Cell Innovation Program at the National Institute of Genetics (http://cell-innovation.nig.ac.jp/index_en.html (date last accessed 17 July 2019)). Adaptor trimming using cutadapt32 and quality filtering (QV = 20) were performed. Filtered reads were trimmed to a specific length that covered most of the sequences. The reads with =10 identical sequences were collapsed into a single sequence in FASTA format and clustered using the BLAT alignment self-alignment program33 with the following parameter settings: -tileSize = 8, -minMatch = 1, -minScore = 10, -repMatch = -1, and -oneOff = 2. This clustering analysis produced several clusters corresponding to a separate retrotransposon insertion site. An optimal threshold was set to evaluate the presence or absence of Rtsp-1 and Cl8 insertions: if the number reads on a given cluster or the total number of reads was <0.0001, then Rtsp-1 or Cl8 was considered not to have been inserted. Based on these criteria, we obtained Rtsp-1 and Cl8 insertion information (inserted, 1; not inserted, 0), which was used to provide molecular marker information for linkage analysis.To develop expressed sequences tag (EST)-derived SSR markers, total RNA from the aerial parts (leaves and stems) and tubers of Fusanoaki was extracted using the Plant RNA Purification Reagent Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Purification of polyadenylated RNA, conversion to cDNA, Sanger sequencing, and trimming were performed as previously described.34 The fuzznuc program from EMBOSS35 was used to identify SSRs longer than 14 bases that contained all possible combinations of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats and allowed a maximum of two mismatches in motifs. Primer pairs for the amplification of SSR-containing regions were designed based on the flanking sequences of each SSR, with the help of the Primer3 program,36 in such a way that the amplified products ranged from 90 to 300 bp in length. PCR was performed with 0.6 ng of genomic DNA of the F1 progeny lines and the parental cultivars in 1X PCR buffer (Bioline, UK), 3 mM of MgCl2, 0.08 units of BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline), 0.8 mM of dNTPs, and 0.4 µM of each primer. A modified touchdown PCR protocol was followed, as described by Sato et al.37 Polymorphisms in PCR products were identified using 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer or with an ABI 3730xl fluorescent fragment analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA), according to the polymorphic fragment sizes of the PCR amplicons. In the latter case, PCR amplicons were labelled with 10 µM of R6G-ddCTP or R110-ddUTP along with 0.16 units of Klenow fragments, 0.5 µl of 10X Klenow buffer (TAKARA BIO Inc., Shiga, Japan), and 0.16 units of Thermo Sequenase DNA polymerase (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Buckinghamshire, England) before electrophoresis. The fragment sizes were investigated using Polyans software (https://www.kazusa.or.jp/phenotyping/polyans/ (date last accessed 17 July 2019)) or GeneMarker software version 2.2.0 (SoftGenetics LLC, USA).SNP markers were developed according to the methods of Shirasawa et al.27 Briefly, the method for ddRAD-seq was as follows: Genomic DNA of the F1 progeny lines and the parental cultivars was digested with two kinds of restriction enzymes (PstI and MspI). An adapter ligation reaction and gel purification were then performed, and a ddRAD-Seq library was developed. The HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina) was used for sequencing. Low-quality reads were removed, and adapter sequences were trimmed from the generated data using PRINSEQ (version 0.20.4)38 and FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.013) (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ (date last accessed 17 July 2019)). The reads were aligned with the genome sequence of Ipomoea trifida (version ITR_r1.0),39 a diploid wild relative of sweetpotato, using Bowtie 2.40 SNP calling on the results of the alignment was performed using VarScan 2 (version 2.3)41 and VCFtools.422.3. Linkage map constructionFor linkage analysis in outcrossing species, such as sweetpotato, a two-way pseudo-testcross strategy developed by Grattapaglia and Sederoff (1994)43 has been applied. In outcrossing species, dominant markers that are heterozygous in one parent and recessive homozygous in the other parent are segregated in the F1 progeny; thus, analysing these markers develops two parental linkage maps. In addition, dominant markers that are heterozygous in both parents are segregated in the F1 progeny, which can be used for linkage analysis as well. In hexaploids, such as sweetpotato, several variations in segregation ratio can be detected based on the allele dosages (simplex, duplex, or triplex; Supplementary Table S1).44 Alleles at higher dosages do not produce polymorphisms. These segregation ratios are affected by cytological characteristics (autohexaploid, tetradiploid, or allohexaploid; Supplementary Table S1). However, clear conclusions about the ploidy type of sweetpotato have not yet been reached.23 Regardless of their cytological characteristics, only simplex markers that present as a single copy in one parent and are absent in the other parent segregate a 1:1 ratio (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, double simplex markers that present as a single copy in both parents segregate in a 3:1 ratio.19,21 Thus, these simplex markers are highly useful for framework map construction.The segregation ratio of the three types of molecular markers in the F1 progeny was calculated, and a chi-square test (P = 0.01) was performed with the calculated and expected segregation ratios. Markers with good fit were used to create a framework map. The linkage map was constructed using the OneMap software (version 2.0.4).45 During linkage map creation, a logarithm of odds (LOD) score was used for the ‘group’ command to make the number of LGs equal to the number of sweetpotato chromosomes (90). For the ‘order’ command, parameters of n.init = 5, subset.search = ‘twopt’, twopt.alg = ‘rcd’, THRES = 3, draw.try = TRUE, wait = 1, and touchdown = TRUE were used. Imputation of missing values and erroneous genotyping data were performed using Maskov (version 1.0) with default parameters.46 The imputed data were grouped and ordered again using OneMap software with the previously mentioned parameters. Graphical charts of the LGs were generated using MapChart software.472.4. Phenotyping of nematode resistanceResistance tests were performed according to the method developed by Tabuchi et al.,18 which is originally described by Sano and Iwahori.15 We used three isolates of M. incognita [Nishigoshi (SP1), Tsukuba (SP4), and Okiishi-12 (SP6-1)], which were originally isolated by Sano et al.17 and Sano and Iwahori.15 The second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. incognita were freshly prepared for each resistance test as follows: a 19-day-old seedling of a susceptible tomato cultivar (Plitz) was inoculated in a 15-cm diameter pot containing ~600 g of a seeding culture soil (Kenbyo, Yaenogei, Japan) with ~6,000 J2, which remained from the former resistance test. Plitz was cultivated in a greenhouse at an average temperature of 25.5°C for 41–48 days. Egg masses, which nematodes formed on the tomato root systems during cultivation, were picked up and placed on a cotton filter partially submerged in water in a beaker at 24°C. In this system, J2 emerged from the egg masses, migrated through the filter, and accumulated at the bottom of the beaker. The cotton filter was transferred to a new beaker every 2–3 days, and the previous beaker was kept at 13°C, which is close to the developmental zero point of M. incognita.48 J2 individuals were collected from 3–5 beakers and used for a new resistance test.During resistance tests, sweetpotato individuals were cultivated at an average temperature of 25.5°C in a greenhouse. Each single-node cutting from F1 progeny lines and parent cultivars produced roots in water in a beaker for 7–9 days and was then transferred into a 9-cm pot containing ~200 g of mixed soil (Kenbyo; steam-sterilized andosol = 1:1) and cultivated for 3 days. Each pot was inoculated with 500 J2 and cultivated for 3 days. The sweetpotato individuals were shaded with newspapers during these treatments because they did not have sufficient roots to be exposed to direct sunlight. Root systems were washed after 35 days of cultivation without shade, and egg masses were stained with 0.02% Erioglaucine (Sigma) and counted.According to the previous reports,18,49 we defined resistance as the presence of <10 egg masses per plant and susceptibility =10. Resistance tests of F1 progeny were performed on at least four plants. When the results of resistance or susceptibility were consistent among plants, the resistance test of the F1 line was considered complete. When the results were different, resistance tests were continued. Finally, the resistance of F1 progeny to each M. incognita race was tested on 4–29 plants, and the average number of egg masses was calculated. For QTL analysis, we used the phenotypic data obtained from 98, 103, and 98 F1 lines for the SP1, SP4, and SP6-1 races, respectively, because the results of resistance tests from other lines were unstable.2.5. QTL analysis and a GWASQTL analysis was performed using MapQTL 6.0.50 Mixture Model was used as the analysis model, and interval mapping was performed using the remaining default settings. Furthermore, to calculate the LOD score as the threshold value for QTL detection, a permutation test (1,000 times) was performed with a significance level of 5%. In addition, to obtain results with higher reliability, GWAS was performed with the SNP marker genotype and nematode-resistance test results using TASSEL version 5.0.51 To visualize the results of this study, a Manhattan plot was created using the qqman R package.52 The Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was performed using an R script, and SNPs with a significantly high relationship to resistance were extracted.2.6. Genotyping using SNP-based PCR markersWe attempted to develop a selection marker for nematode resistance found on the base sequences of the gene regions determined using QTL analysis and the GWAS. A primer with a J-Red SNP at the 3' end and an artificial mismatch at the third base were designed for PCR in accordance with the methods reported by Hayashi et al.53 SNPs at and around the QTL peaks were used in the primer design. The genotyping primer sets were designed, and a preliminary genotype analysis was performed under the following conditions using only the parental and 14 F1 progeny plants at first. The PCR reaction solution contained 10 ng of DNA, 1.0 µl of 10X PCR Buffer, 0.8 µl of dNTPs (2.5 mM each), 0.25 units of TAKARA Taq Hot Start Version, and 0.2 µl each of the forward and reverse primers and was adjusted to a total volume of 10 µl. The reaction was started at a temperature of 94°C for 2 min, and then cycled at 94°C for 10 s <U+2192> 60°C for 10 s <U+2192> 72°C for 30 s for 30 cycles and finished at 4°C. A 2% agarose gel was used for the detection of polymorphisms. A primer set that worked well for genotyping was selected, and genotype analysis was performed under the same conditions for the parental strains and the F1 plants used for nematode resistance screening. The following primers derived from the Itr_s002268_68403 SNP were used for the genotyping of the parental plants and 104 F1 progeny plants: forward: 5'-GCTTCGGCTCCACGTCAAT and reverse: 5´'- CCAACAACACTCCAAAGCAAG.3. Results3.1. High-density linkage map construction using SNP, SSR, and retrotransposon-based markersAccording to the sequencing procedure that develops retrotransposon-based markers, 30,372,493 150-bp paired-end reads, including exact barcode sequences, were obtained using MiSeq, with 17,649,817 remaining reads, representing 42,059 individual sequences (around 420-fold sequence redundancy), after pre-processing events, such as trimming and filtering. Results of the clustering analysis using BLAT identified Rtsp-1 insertions in 222 sites in J-Red, 207 sites in Choshu, and an average of 202.5 sites in the F1 mapping populations. Cl8 family insertions in 610 sites in J-Red, 613 sites in Choshu, and an average of 564.6 sites in the F1 mapping populations were identified. For the identification of insertion sites, the allele dosage of an insertion was considered from a chi-square goodness-of-fit test (P = 0.01) with the expected segregation ratio. For Rtsp-1, of the 105 sites that existed in both parents, 41 (39.0%) were believed to be double simplex. The insertion sites that existed only in either J-Red or Choshu occurred at 117 and 102 sites, respectively, and 99 (84.6%) and 79 (77.5%) sites were believed to be simplex insertions, respectively. For C18, of the 318 sites that existed in both parents, 118 (37.1%) were believed to be double simplex. The insertion sites that existed only in either J-Red or Choshu occurred at 292 and 295 sites, respectively, and 182 (62.3%) and 173 (58.6%) sites were believed to be simplex insertions, respectively. In total, 281 and 252 insertion sites were considered simplex markers in J-Red and Choshu, respectively, and 159 insertion sites were considered double simplex markers (Table 1). Summary of molecular markers developed for linkage map constructionSummary of molecular markers developed for linkage map constructionFor the development of EST-derived SSR markers, a total of 7,680 cDNA clones were sequenced, which include 3,840 clones each from the aerial and tubers of the sweetpotato cultivar Fusanoaki. A sum of 7,669 ESTs was obtained after trimming. Of the 7,669 ESTs, 564 SSRs were identified, and the primers were successfully designed on the flanking regions of the 121 SSRs (Supplementary Table S2). To increase the number of EST-SSR markers, additional primer pairs were designed that allowed either single- or two-base mismatches. The newly developed markers were designated as Ipomoea EST-derived SSR (IES) markers. As a result, a total of 1,215 IES markers were designed (Supplementary Table S2). Among the 1,215 IES markers generated, 978 (80.5%) were trinucleotide repeats, whereas 133 (10.9%) and 104 (8.6%) were di- and tetranucleotide repeats, respectively. The poly-(AAG)n motif was most abundant in the trinucleotide repeats, followed by poly-(GGC)n and poly-(GGA)n. Among the di-nucleotide motifs, poly-(AG)n was the most frequently observed. The primer sequences and details of the IES markers are described in Supplementary Table S3. The 1,215 IES markers were subjected to polymorphic marker screening by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels using the DNAs of both parents and the F1 mapping populations. The results for SSR marker genotype information showed that 632 markers existed in both parents, 335 in J-Red, and 418 only in Choshu. The results of the goodness-of-fit test with the expected segregation ratio showed that 143 (22.6%) of all the markers that existed in both parents were believed to be double simplex and 181 (54.0%) and 219 (52.4%) of the markers that existed only in J-Red and Choshu were believed to be simplex, respectively (Table 1).After sequencing the ddRAD-seq library with the HiSeq 2500 platform, a total of 263,837,348 reads were obtained, with an average of 2.4 million reads per plant. We identified 56,513 candidate SNPs by comparing the reads obtained from a ddRAD-Seq library sequence analysis with the I. trifida genome sequence.39 We can assume seven different genotypes representing genetic loci in a hexaploid as follows: AAAAAA, AAAAAa, AAAAaa, AAAaaa, AAaaaa, Aaaaaa, and aaaaaa. ‘A’ is identical to the I. trifida reference allele, and ‘a’ is different from the I. trifida reference allele. Among them, only simplex or double simplex alleles were extracted using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test (P = 0.01). A test for goodness-of-fit with the expected segregation ratio was conducted, and the results indicated that there were 2,418 (AAAAAa × AAAAAa) and 485 (Aaaaaa × Aaaaaa) SNPs that there were believed to be double simplex alleles in both parents. In total, 2,903 SNPs were extracted as double simplex markers for further analysis. In SNPs that existed only in J-Red, there were 4,885 (AAAAAA × AAAAAa) and 678 (aaaaaa × Aaaaaa) SNPs that were believed to be simplex alleles; meanwhile, in SNPs that only existed in Choshu, there were 4,502 (AAAAAa × AAAAAA) and 607 (Aaaaaa × aaaaaa) SNPs that were considered to be simplex alleles. In total, there were 5,563 (4,885 + 678) and 5,109 (4,502 + 607) simplex SNP markers in J-Red and Choshu cultivars, respectively (Table 1). These three types of marker that had a good fit with the expected segregation ratio (retrotransposon-based, SSR, and SNP) were used in the linkage analysis (Table 1).A linkage map was constructed using the OneMap program45; the linkage maps for J-Red and Choshu cultivars were both created with 90 LGs. There were 6,341 markers in J-Red (SNP: 5,952, retrotransposon-based: 228, SSR: 161), yielding a linkage map with a total length of 13,247.0 cM (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S4). The average length of each linkage group was 147.2 cM, the average distance between markers was 2.09 cM, and the average number of markers was 70.5 (Table 2). There were 6,008 markers in Choshu (SNP: 5,640, retrotransposon-based: 192, SSR: 176), yielding a linkage map with a total length of 12,241.8 cM (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S5). The average length of each linkage group was 136.0 cM, the average distance between markers was 2.04 cM, and the average number of markers was 66.8 (Table 2). The LGs were named in accordance with the map reported by Shirasawa et al.27 by anchoring common SNP positions on the ITR_r1.0. Summary of linkage groups constructed in this studySummary of linkage groups constructed in this study3.2. Phenotyping of nematode resistanceThe results of the evaluation of M. incognita resistance are shown in Fig. 1. For the parental cultivars, the average number of egg masses on J-Red (0.4, 1.9, and 1.3 for the SP1, SP4, and SP6-1 races, respectively) was significantly smaller than on Choshu (178.1, 233.0, and 209.6 for the SP1, SP4, and SP6-1 races, respectively); there was a large difference in the resistance of the parental cultivars. When defining resistance as <10 egg masses and susceptibility as =10 egg masses,18,49 the F1 progeny segregated a 1:1 ratio according to resistance or susceptibility to any of the races (Supplementary Table S6). Segregation of egg mass numbers for the F1 progeny was extremely biased and did not follow a normal distribution; as a result, they were not suitable for QTL analysis. Thus, a value of 1 was added to the number of egg masses, and the common logarithm was taken to yield the input value used for QTL analysis. The reason why a value of 1 was added was that the average number of egg mass was zero in some F1 plants and the common logarithm of zero is not defined. In addition, the correlation between each race was investigated using these values after logarithmic conversion. The correlations between SP1 and either SP4 or SP6-1 were 0.77 and 0.86, respectively, and the correlation between SP4 and SP6-1 was 0.75; all these are high values (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consequently, resistance to these three races was found to be highly correlated.

Black and white arrows indicate the values of J-Red and Choshu, respectively.3.3. QTL analysis and GWASQTL analysis of resistance to SP1, SP4, and SP6-1 was conducted using the high-density linkage map. Regions with an LOD score of =2.5 based on the analysis of MapQTL 6 were considered as candidate QTL peaks. The LOD threshold was determined with 1,000 permutations. The results indicated that the candidate QTL peaks (explaining 29.6–36.7% of the variance) for the highly effective resistance of J-Red to all the races were found in the Ib01_6 linkage group (Table 3). All these are located extremely close together in a region on the linkage group, and based on the high correlation between the three races, this region is thought to be a common QTL. Other small QTL peaks included an SP4-susceptibile candidate QTL (explaining 30.0% of the variance) detected in Ib01_4 in J-Red, an SP4-resistant candidate QTL (explaining 21.7% of the variance) in Ib07_4 in J-Red, and an SP6-1-susceptible candidate QTL (explaining 26.6% of the variance) on Ib01_1 in Choshu (Table 3). Summary of QTLs identified in this studySummary of QTLs identified in this studyIn addition, GWAS was conducted using the resistance test results and SNP marker genotype data. One peak that was highly correlated to resistance to all races was found on Ib01_6 (Fig. 2). This peak is consistent with the major QTL peak on Ib01_6 that was detected via QTL analysis (Supplementary Table S7); thus, it is believed to be effective. Accordingly, we developed a PCR-based DNA marker for Meloidogyne resistance selection with a focus on this QTL.

Development of PCR-based DNA markers for selecting resistant plantsWe focussed on three SNP markers that exist near the QTL peak on Ib01_6 (Itr_sc002268_68403, Itr_sc003013_33365, and Itr_sc000186_110963) to develop a marker for the selection of resistance to SP1, SP4, and SP6-1. First, we designed PCR primers for genotyping according to the methods developed by Hayashi et al.53 These were designed based on J-Red-derived SNPs. Using these primers, we conducted a pilot study on the parental cultivars and 14 F1 progeny. The clearest bands were detected when using primers based on Itr_sc002268_68403 (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, as expected, a clear single band was observed in J-Red, but not in Choshu. Thus, we used this primer to conduct PCR genotyping of the parental cultivars and 104 F1 progeny (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). The mean number of egg masses on the F1 plants was significantly different based on the genotypes of Itr_sc002268_68403 SNP, which indicates that this marker had the greatest effect on resistance (Fig. 4). Genotyping results using this marker showed that of the 104 progeny, resistance or susceptibility was discernible in 74 (71.2%) for SP1, 72 (69.2%) for SP4, and 76 (73.0%) for SP6-1 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Using the marker we developed, whether a sweetpotato plant is resistant or susceptible to the three races of nematodes can be identified with a high accuracy rate at 70%. Therefore, this marker can be used for discerning resistance to multiple races of M. incognita during marker-assisted selection of sweetpotato.

DiscussionIn this study, a high-density linkage map of the sweetpotato genome was successfully established using SNP, retrotransposon, and SSR markers. In addition, QTLs related to M. incognita resistance were detected using this linkage map. Therefore, we were able to discern resistance from susceptibility, with a high level of probability, by genotyping F1 plants using PCR primers based on the identified SNPs. Thus, the marker we developed in this study is likely to be useful in selective breeding for resistance to multiple races of M. incognita. This study provides a breakthrough in the development of selective markers found on NGS-based comprehensive genetic analyses in sweetpotato, a highly polyploid and non-model crop species lacking reference genome sequences.There are other reports of QTL analysis in M. incognita and the development of resistance markers. Whether resistance to Meloidogyne is a qualitative or quantitative trait is still open for debate, and to date, a definitive answer has not been reached.54–57 Cervantes-Flores et al.58 have created a linkage map and identified nine QTLs related to M. incognita in sweetpotato, but these showed only small effects. On the contrary, two independent dominant genes (Rmi1 and Rmi2) have been reported to control Meloidogyne resistance in I. trifida, the ancestral species of sweetpotato.59,60 In addition, a recent report by Nakayama et al.,49 which conducted a QTL analysis of the F1 population of a hybrid of the SP1/SP2-resistant cultivar Hi-starch and the nematode-susceptible cultivar Koganesengan, indicated that SP1/SP2 resistance in Hi-starch was controlled by a single major dominant gene that showed simplex inheritance. Their data have indicated that the positions of the genes controlling SP1/SP2 resistance are either the same or extremely similar. In addition, the AFLP markers E33M53_090 and E41M32_206 around this resistance gene location (qRmi(t)) were converted to sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. In the present study, J-Red-derived SP1-, SP4-, and SP6-1-resistant QTLs were identified using the F1 progeny of the resistant cultivar J-Red and the susceptible cultivar Choshu, and we developed a marker that facilitates the use of SNPs in these regions for simple genotyping. To investigate the consistency between the Hi-starch-derived QTL and the J-Red-derived QTL, primer sequences SCAR markers developed by Nakayama et al.49 were blasted against the genome sequences of I. trifida (version ITR_r1.0). Results showed that the primer sequences had no hits with any scaffolds located in the J-Red-derived QTL region. Thus, the J-Red-derived QTL identified in our study should be novel. The dominant race of nematode in sweetpotato fields varies according to the cultivation area; therefore, ideal markers that can be used to identify resistance to multiple races will be established. In this study, we developed a marker that can be used for the selection of sweetpotato cultivars that are resistant to three races of nematode.Mi-1 gene was reported to belong to the class of nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance (R) genes confers resistance to M. incognita in tomato.61 We attempted to identify the target gene(s) controlling M. incognita resistance in the QTL region on the Ib01-6 linkage group. A total of 254 genes in the I. trifida scaffolds corresponded to this QTL region. We found that one gene (Itr_sc000186.1_g00004.1) belongs to the NBS-LRR family based on the gene annotation information. However, the Itr_sc000186.1 scaffold is positioned slightly apart from the region with the highest QTL peak, and this scaffold exists in three LGs (Ib01-1, Ib01-4, and Ib01-6). One of the possibilities is that this gene might exist on the three homologous genomes (Ib01-1, Ib01-4, and Ib01-6), and only the allele on the Ib01-6 linkage group may affect resistance. To validate the target gene(s) for resistance, information from ongoing projects on deciphering the whole genome sequences and the haplotype phasing of the hexaploidy species I. batatas is awaited.62 In addition, we are currently conducting an RNA-seq analysis using J-Red and Choshu cultivars with or without nematode inoculation. Considering the data from the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), this QTL region may facilitate cloning of the target gene(s).Evaluation of resistances to SP1, SP4, and SP6-1 showed a high correlation in the F1 mapping populations of J-Red and Choshu (Supplementary Fig. S1). In fact, we detected a highly effective QTL that was common for resistance in all three races in the Ib01-6 linkage group (Fig. 2 and Table 3). However, the reaction (resistant/susceptible) of each F1 line to the three races was not completely consistent (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, several other minor QTLs were detected for races SP4 and SP6-1, which should affect resistance (Table 3). Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of these minor QTLs and the combinations of multiple QTLs. SP4-susceptible and -resistant QTLs were also detected on Ib01-4 and Ib07-4 in J-Red, which is the resistant cultivar, respectively (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). We designed these QTLs on Ib01-6, Ib07-4, and Ib01-4 as R1, R2, and S, respectively. We divided the plants into eight groups (=23) based on the presence or absence of the combinations of these detected QTLs. We compared the average number of egg masses found on these eight groups in the F1 plants (Supplementary Fig. S6). The average number of egg masses on plants with J-Red genotypes for the two resistant QTLs and the Choshu genotype for the susceptible QTL (R1 × R2 × s) was 7.7 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, this group had the highest proportion of resistant plants (13/16 = 81.3%). By contrast, the group of plants that had Choshu genotypes for the two resistant QTLs and the J-Red genotype for the susceptible QTL (r1 × r2 × S) had the greatest proportion of susceptible plants (resistance in 2/20 plants = 90.0% susceptibility). Interestingly, the average number of egg masses on the plants with the R1 × r2 × S genotype was 60.1, whereas that on the plants with the R1 × R2 × S genotype was 8.6, which indicated that R2 should suppress the effect of S only when R2 coexists with R1. Although the target genes of those QTLs have not been resolved and the details are unknown, a genetic interaction between R1 and R2 might exist. Based on the abovementioned information, the genotypes at these three QTLs could be used to obtain more detailed information for the selection of resistance or susceptibility. However, as the number of lines decreases when classifying them according to the presence of three specific genotypes, it may be most effective to use the major QTL on Ib01-6 as a marker for selection. In addition, the number of egg masses on the plants with the R1 × R2 × S genotype (8.6) was slightly higher than on J-Red (1.9), which suggested that other undetected minor QTLs may affect the resistance. While a QTL believed to be involved in susceptibility to SP6-1 was detected in Choshu, there was no significant difference in the number of egg masses between strains with or without the Choshu genotype for this QTL (Supplementary Fig. S7).J-Red has a rare characteristic of resistance to almost all races of M. incognita, except for SP8. Therefore, this cultivar may be used for QTL analysis and for the development of other markers for the selection of resistant cultivars against other races of nematodes that were not used in this study. We are currently working on QTL analysis and the development of markers for the selection of resistance to other races of nematodes. Our research has shown that it is possible to use NGS to develop high-density linkage maps and for genome-wide analysis of genetically complex crop species, such as sweetpotato; these can be used for the identification of more effective QTLs and the development of markers for selection. As genomic information continues to improve, genes related to resistance may be detected in the near future.AvailabilityThe ESTs obtained to develop SSR markers were submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession numbers HX972900 to HX980564.

IntroductionMolluscs evolved in the ocean, yet today there are ~5,000 freshwater species worldwide originating from >40 independent colonization events.1–3 While most freshwater mollusc species are gastropods (ca. 4,000 species),2 several bivalves (e.g. Dreissena rostriformis, Dreissena polymorpha, Limnoperna fortunei and Corbicula fluminea) have proven to be highly successful and ecologically disruptive invasive species that function as ecosystem engineers of colonized environments.4–7Bivalves have invaded freshwater habitats on at least 11 occasions.3,8 Despite the independence of these events, freshwater species all typically maintain their internal osmotic pressure above that of their environment.9,10 This differs to marine and brackish water species which typically maintain their body fluid osmolarity at equilibrium with their environment.11 Due to their large surface area to volume ratio, the issue of cellular osmoregulation is expected to be particularly acute for the eggs and embryos of broadcast spawners such as the quagga mussel D. rostriformis (Fig. 1a and b). The ability of quagga mussels to withstand the harsh osmotic conditions of the freshwater environment during embryogenesis may contribute to their capacity for rapid spread through newly colonized habitats.

Quagga mussels evolved in the isolated Lake Pannon between 10 and 8.5 million years ago.12 Their native range today spans the Black and Caspian Sea catchments which are remnants of this ancient lake. Invasive populations of quagga mussels are now established throughout mainland Europe, the British Isles and North America where they have caused enormous ecological and economic impacts13–16 (Fig. 1c). Quagga mussels, like their close relatives the zebra mussels (Fig. 1d), have the capacity for high density biofouling and for nutrient redistribution of colonized habitats.17 Furthermore, in invaded habitats once dominated by zebra mussels, the introduction of quagga mussels has repeatedly lead to the replacement of the former with the latter.18 This is most well illustrated in the great lakes of North America where nearly all of the area once colonized by zebra mussels has since been overtaken by quagga mussels.19,20A conspicuous feature of the early cleavage stages of some freshwater and terrestrial molluscs is the formation of a large, lens-shaped, fluid-filled cavity between dividing cells.21,22 Following cell division, small cavities appear along the cell–cell border, gradually coalescing until a single large cavity remains. The contents of the cleavage cavity are then rapidly discharged to the environment before a new cavity begins to form. An osmoregulatory role for cleavage cavities has been previously suggested but their patchy phylogenetic distribution indicates a complex evolutionary history.21,23,24To identify genetic signatures underpinning the capacity of quagga mussels for freshwater tolerance, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the ~1.6 gigabase (Gb) genome of D. rostriformis. Using both developmental and comparative approaches, we reveal the machinery and structures utilized by quagga mussels for embryonic osmoregulation, which is a key feature underpinning their invasive capacity for rapid range expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these innovations have also independently evolved on multiple occasions coinciding with freshwater colonization events by a diverse range of species.2. Materials and methodsA detailed Materials and methods section can be found in Supplementary Materials. A brief overview follows here.2.1. Sampling and sequencingA single male D. rostriformis selected for DNA extraction was collected from the Danube river in Vienna, Austria (48°14'45.9""N, 16°23'38.0""E) and treated with an antibiotic–antimycotic solution (Gibco 15240062) to minimize the risk of bacterial or fungal contamination (Supplementary Material SM 1). Three shotgun libraries including two 300-bp insert and one 550-bp insert polymerase chain reaction free library were prepared in addition to three long jumping distance libraries (3, 8 and 20 kb) which were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Four developmental RNA-seq libraries (gastrula, trochophore, early veliger and juvenile) were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 for transcriptome construction and genome annotation. An additional 18 RNA-seq libraries were also sequenced for the purpose of quantitative gene expression analyses. Proprietary read processing of the long jumping distance libraries including quality and adaptor trimming was performed by Eurofins Genomics. Quality and adaptor trimming of the shotgun libraries was performed with trimmomatic25 and library quality assessed with FastQC (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Kmer counting was performed with Jellyfish26 and genome size and heterozygosity were estimated with GenomeScope.272.2. Genome assemblyGenome contig assembly, scaffolding and gap-closing were performed with Platanus28 on the SGI Altix Ultra Violet 1000 located at the Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (Supplementary Material SM 2). Following assembly, heterozygosity was reduced using the Redundans pipeline29 performed on the Life Science Compute Cluster (CUBE) located at the University of Vienna, Austria. Quast30 was used to assess genome assembly metrics and read re-mapping was performed with Bowtie2.31 Potential contamination of the assembly was assessed with BlobTools.322.3. Genome annotationA custom RepeatModeler33 library was built and used to mask repetitive elements in the genome assembly with RepeatMasker34 (Supplementary Material SM 3). Ab initio gene prediction was performed with Augustus35 and SNAP.36 Homology-based prediction was performed with GeneWise based on the alignment of the complete annotated protein coding transcriptomes of five species (Crassostrea gigas, Octopus bimaculoides, Lottia gigantea, Lingula anatina and Drosophila melanogaster) to the Dreissena genome with TBLASTN (e value = 1e-5) to produce accurate spliced alignments. De novo transcriptome assemblies from the four developmental RNA-seq libraries were produced with Binpacker37 using five different kmer values (k23, k25, k27, k29 and k32) which were subsequently merged with Velvet38 and de-duplicated with Dedupe.39 Open reading frames were predicted with Transdecoder40 and these putative protein coding transcripts were mapped back to the genome assembly with GMAP.41 For reference-based transcriptome assembly, the trimmed RNA-seq libraries were mapped against the genome assembly with STAR aligner42 and then assembled with StringTie.43 These assemblies were merged with the StringTie merge function and open reading frames predicted with Transdecoder. The de novo transcriptome assembly, the reference-based transcriptome assembly, the two ab initio gene prediction outputs and the homology-based gene prediction were used as input for EvidenceModeler.44 The resulting set of transcripts were filtered to include those that have homology to either the Pfam, uniref90 or CDD databases or for which there is evidence of expression in one of the 22 developmental RNA-seq databases. Gene models that overlapped with repetitive sequences as assessed by RepeatMasker for at least 50% of their length were also excluded. Final transcriptome ‘completeness’ was assessed with BUSCO.452.4. Phylogenetics and phylogenomicsTo determine the taxonomic status of the quagga mussel sampled here, a phylogeny was produced using FastTree 246 with the LG evolutionary model as determined by ProtTest 347 based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences using all dreissenids available from Barcode of Life Database (BoLD),48 in addition to those used in a previous taxonomic analyses of the family49 (Fig. 2a). An alignment using MAFFT50 of 16S sequences from Therriault et al.,49 from NCBI and from our assembly was also undertaken to determine the subspecies sampled (Fig. 2b). A phylogenomic tree was produced to confirm the position of the quagga mussel within the Bivalvia (Supplementary Material SM 4). A total of 1,377 curated orthogroups obtained from 40 molluscan taxa, including 34 bivalves51 were downloaded and used to build profile-hidden Markov models (pHMMs) and multiple sequence alignments to extend the orthologue groups using HaMStr.52 Multiple sequence alignments were generated with MAFFT50 and pHMMs built with hmmbuild from the HMMER3 package.53 The extended orthogroups were concatenated into a super matrix with FASconCAT54 and the phylogeny inferred with FastTree 2. Dreissenid COI phylogeny and 16S alignment.

Identification and phylogenetic analysis of embryonic osmoregulatory candidate genesThe genes required for early embryonic osmoregulation are likely to be maternally inherited and so their relative expression levels are unlikely to be affected by the osmotic environment of the embryo. As such, an approach was required that did not rely on changes to relative transcript abundance under experimental osmotic conditions, such as differential gene expression analysis. To identify genes encoding proteins with known roles in osmoregulation, ionic homeostasis and excretion, the full set of Dreissena gene models were used to search the KEGG database55 using the KAAS search tool.56 Genes encoding transmembrane proteins involved in one of five KEGG pathways: (i) vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, (ii) proximal-tubule bicarbonate reclamation, (iii) collecting duct acid secretion, (iv) aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption and (v) endocrine and other factor calcium reabsorption, were retained (Supplementary Material SM 5). To determine which of the candidate genes are significantly up-regulated during early embryogenesis, RNA-seq reads from the 18 developmental libraries were pseudoaligned to the Dreissena transcriptome with Kallisto57 to determine the normalized Transcripts Per Million (TPM) value for each gene at each developmental time point. This pipeline was repeated with equivalent data from the marine species C. gigas. A Fisher’s exact test was performed in R to identify those candidate genes that are up-regulated during the non-swimming early developmental stages (unfertilized eggs, 2–4 cell embryos and gastrulas) against the background, defined as the average TPM value of all remaining developmental stages, using an e value cut-off of 1e-6. Any gene that met this criteria in both Dreissena and Crassostrea was removed from the list of candidates while those uniquely up-regulated in Dreissena during early development were retained. While a marine species more closely related Dreissena would have made a more desirable comparative target than Crassostrea, at the time of this project’s undertaking no such high-resolution developmental RNA-seq datasets were publicly available for any other marine bivalve. To place the candidate genes in a phylogenetic context, family members were obtained from related species using Pfam hidden Markov models with hmmsearch from the HMMER package.53 Amino acid sequences were aligned with MAFFT,50 visualized with Aliview58 and trimmed with BMGE.59 Tree construction was performed with FastTree 246 using the LG evolutionary model as determined by ProtTest 347 for all alignments (Supplementary Material SM 6).2.6. 3D Structural protein modellingThe aquaporin orthologue found to be highly expressed during early Dreissena embryogenesis (see Embryonic osmoregulatory gene identification and characterization) was uploaded to SWISS-MODEL60 for structural modelling (Supplementary Material SM 7). Models were built from the top 14 templates (as determined by a quaternary structure quality estimate of >0.5), which included structures from four aquaporin orthologues—AQPO (PDB: 1YMG), AQP1 (PDB: 5C5X), AQP4 (PDB: 1J4N) and AQP5 (PDB: 2ZZ9). Stabilization of the quaternary structure through the formation of salt bridges was predicted with ESBRI,61 protein structure visualizations were performed with PyMOL62 and peptide logos were constructed with Skylign.632.7. Embryogenesis under osmolarity challengesAdult mussels collected from the Danube River in Vienna, Austria, were induced to spawn through immersion in 0.5 mM serotonin dissolved in filtered river water (FRW). The jelly layer of the eggs was removed by immersion in a pH 8.6 FRW solution before being washed in ambient FRW (Supplementary Material SM 8). De-jellied eggs were fertilized through the introduction of sperm and these were subsequently washed and transferred to a WillCo glass bottom dish for observation on a Leitz Labovert inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Ambient conditions meant that development occurred at ~26°C. To test the impact of osmolarity on embryogenesis, a cohort of de-jellied, fertilized embryos were allowed to develop in a high osmolarity solution consisting of an artificial seawater salt mix (Sera Marin, 1.75 ppt) dissolved in FRW. Another cohort was allowed to develop in a low osmolarity solution consisting of a dilution of FRW in reverse-osmosis filtered water (1:3 dilution).3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyIn total, 147.8 Gb of short-read shotgun sequence was generated, equating to ~92-fold coverage of the estimated 1.6-Gb quagga mussel genome. Kmer assessment with GenomeScope indicated a high heterozygosity rate of 2.4% which is a well-publicized hindrance to contiguous genome assembly and was the primary reason behind the decision to use Platanus28 for the genome assembly. Contig assembly, scaffolding and gap-closing, and haplotype reduction with Redundans,29 resulted in an assembly covering 1.24 Gb with an N50 of 131.4 kb. The difference of ~360 Mb between the assembled genome and the predicted genome size is most likely explained by the collapsing or reduction of highly repetitive regions, as has been observed with other genome assemblies.64 Mapping of the paired end libraries back to the completed genome resulted in 94.5% realignment, confirming the integrity of the assembly. RepeatMasker revealed a repeat population covering 31.9% of the assembly with most bases (24.2%) masked by unclassified repeats (Supplementary Material SM 3).BlobTools32 was used to search for scaffolds in the final assembly with likely non-target origins. This demonstrated no evidence of contamination (Supplementary Material SM 2). Quagga mussels live in dense communities in close association with a high diversity of bacterial, metazoan and other eukaryotic species (Fig. 1a). The absence of contaminating scaffolds in the genome assembly is most likely the result of the thorough efforts employed to avoid contamination prior to DNA extraction.3.2. Genome annotation and transcriptome constructionThe pipeline employed to construct the complete set of gene models from the quagga mussel genome incorporated ab initio, homology, de novo transcriptome and reference-based transcriptome gene models (Supplementary Material SM 3). After processing these various inputs with EvidenceModeler,44 99,522 gene models were determined. Further filtering for genes that had homology to entries in one of three publicly maintained databases (see Materials and methods) had evidence of expression in at least one RNA-seq dataset and did not overlap with repeat elements for >50% of its length resulted in a set of 37,681 coding genes models. These included 95% of either full length or fragmented metazoan BUSCO v2.0 genes45 (Supplementary Material SM 3). Homology support for the 37,681 coding genes models ranged from 68% (CDD) to 86% (uniref90) with a total 87% of gene models showing homology support from at least one of the three databases examined.3.3. Quagga mussel phylogenyThe taxonomic nomenclature of the quagga mussel is unresolved. The two most common assignments for this species are D. rostriformis and Dreissena bugensis with rostriformis often designated as a subspecies of the latter.49,65 Reported differences between D. rostriformis and D. bugensis include the depth at which they are found and the salinity of their native habitats, however attempts to discriminate the two species on the basis of morphology have proven difficult due to the high level of intraspecific relative to interspecific variation.Our results support the discontinuation of D. bugensis as a species distinct from D. rostriformis.66 They also indicate that the species names allocated to the quagga mussel samples in the BoLD database (D. rostriformis, D. bugensis, D. rostriformis bugensis) do not represent distinct genetic clades. As such, the preferred name is D. rostriformis as it is the oldest of the candidates (D. rostriformis, ANDRUSOV 1839 versus D. bugensis, ANDRUSOV 1867). A single well-supported clade within the D. rostriformis branch that includes the sample sequenced here, in addition to the D. bugensis sample collected by Therriault et al.49 was identified, suggesting that the shallow freshwater form may represent a genetically distinct group, although more dedicated sampling will be required to confirm this. This analysis was unable to resolve the distinction between the BoLD D. presbensis and Dreissena stankovici COI sequences. Neither of these species names is marked as ‘accepted’ on the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) database67 and it is likely that both are synonyms for Dreissena carinata (Dunker, 1853).In examining the 16S rRNA sequences of D. rostriformis and D. bugensis, Therriault et al.49 identified a single nucleotide difference between the two forms which could be used as a diagnostic identification tool by cleaving polymerase chain reaction products with the restriction enzymes MspI or HpaII. The 16S sequence from the sample sequenced here is consistent with D. rostriformis, however, as with the COI analysis, more dedicated sampling will be required to confirm this as a diagnostic feature (Fig. 2b).Phylogenetic assessment placed the quagga mussel amongst the Imparidentia, sister to the congeneric zebra mussel D. polymorpha (Supplementary Material SM 4). Consistent with previous reports, we find that the closest relative to the Dreissena lineage is the soft shell clam Mya arenaria51 and that this group has the longest branch length of the Imparidentia.3.4. Embryonic osmoregulatory gene identification and characterizationIn total, 27 aquaporins (Pfam: PF00230.19), 8 sodium/potassium ATPases (Pfam: PF00287.17), 13 sodium/hydrogen exchangers (NHE, Pfam: PF00999.20), 8 hydrogen/carbonate co-transporters (Pfam: PF00955.20), 12 voltage gated chloride channels (PF00654.19), 9 cation ATPases (Pfam: PF00689.20, PF13246.5 and PF00690.25) and 17 hydrogen ATPases (Pfam: PF00006.24, PF02874.22, PF01813.16, PF03223.14, PF03179.14, PF01496.18, PF01992.15 and PF01991.17) were identified from the quagga mussel gene models, while in Crassostrea, 2 sodium/potassium ATPases, 11 NHEs, 8 hydrogen/carbonate co-transporters, 6 voltage gated chloride channels, 10 cation ATPases and 11 hydrogen ATPases (Supplementary Material SM 5) were found. Early embryogenesis (pre-swimming stages that lack distinct osmoregulatory organs) in the quagga mussel is associated with significantly (1e-6) high expression levels of an aquaporin (Gene.75921), an NHE (Gene.62031), a vacuolar ATPase subunit a (Gene.62284) and a sodium potassium ATPase (Gene.85204) while in Crassostrea, the expression profiles of two sodium/potassium ATPases (EKC41758, EKC32470) and one cation ATPase (EKC34610) were highly correlated with similar stages of development. High expression levels of aquaporins, vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) subunit as or sodium/hydrogen exchangers were not observed in the pre-swimming embryonic stages of Crassostrea (Fig. 3a).

Color figures are available at DNARES online. A phylogeny of 291 aquaporin genes including 168 bivalve sequences from 15 species spanning both marine and freshwater taxa successfully resolved the 4 major animal aquaporin classes—classical aquaporins, aquaamoniaporins, unorthodox aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins68 (Fig. 3b;Supplementary Material SM 6). Entomoglyceroporins (EGLPs),69 malacoaquaporins,70,Drosophila intrinsic proteins (DRIPs)71 and Pyrocoelia rufa integral proteins (PRIPs)72 were also resolved. In addition, a group consisting of representatives from the brachiopod Lingula and the freshwater annelid leech Helobdella robusta were found to branch between the aquaammoniaporins and the EGLPs. No support for the malacoglyceroporin (Mglp) clade was found in our study.70,73A previously unidentified class of lophotrochozoan-specific classical aquaporins (hereafter referred to as lophotrochoaquaporins) that includes the embryonically highly expressed Dreissena orthologue, appears to have expanded on at least four occasions, coinciding with the freshwater bivalves Dreissena, C. fluminea, L. fortunei and the Unionidae (a species-rich monophyletic taxon of freshwater paleoheterodont bivalves). In contrast, none of the marine bivalves shows evidence of such an expansion. Outside of the bivalves, Helobdella also has an expanded set of lophotrochoaquaporins while the freshwater gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and Biomphalaria glabrata possess long branch lengths without evidence of expansions (Fig. 3b).In the quagga mussel, three lophotrochoaquaporin orthologues form a clade with those of the congeneric freshwater D. polymorpha (two orthologues) and the closely related marine species M. arenaria (one orthologue). While the five orthologues of the freshwater C. fluminea were not annotated against a genome, the level of sequence divergence between the orthologues makes it likely that at least three represent true paralogues (Supplementary Material SM 6), the same number found in the quagga mussel.The distantly related freshwater golden mussel L. fortunei possesses an expanded set of nine lophotrochoaquaporin orthologues whereas its closest relatives, the marine Modiolus philippinarum and Bathymodiolus platifrons, possess only a single copy each. No genomic resources are yet available for any of the freshwater paleoheterodonts (unionids) and thus, to avoid conflating transcript variants with true orthologues, expanded aquaporin clades were only annotated if they included representatives from at least three species. Four unionid clades were thus identified, indicating that the last common ancestor of these species likely already possessed an expanded repertoire of lophotrochoaquaporins. Only a single lophotrochoaquaporin orthologue was identified in the marine paleoheterodont Neotrigonia. margaritacea, which is the closest marine relative of the freshwater unionids. While the identification of more N. margaritacea orthologues with increased sampling cannot be ruled out, it appears that the paleoheterodont lophotrochoaquaporin expansion occurred after the divergence of the marine and freshwater species and before speciation of the unionids.The v-ATPase subunit a is the most diverse of the v-ATPase subunits74,75 and is responsible for targeting the v-ATPase complex to specific sites within the cell.76,77 No comprehensive phylogeny of metazoan v-ATPase subunit a sequences is yet available. In vertebrates, four subunit a isoforms have been identified, each with distinct functions and expression patterns.78,79 It is unknown how these relate to the v-ATPase subunit a isoforms of other metazoan lineages. We find v-ATPase subunit a expansions in each phylum investigated, however molluscs appear to have undergone two rounds of diversification giving rise to two distinct monophyletic subclasses (Supplementary Material SM 6).Sodium hydrogen exchangers form part of the monovalent cation proton antiporter (CAP) superfamily.80 Phylogenetic analysis successfully resolved all previously reported animal CAP classes—NHA, PM-NHE and Endo/TGN IC-NHE and NHE8-like IC-NHE (Supplementary Material SM 6). We were also able to resolve the position of the enigmatic mammalian sperm NHEs with a well-supported clade consisting of deuterostome, lophotrochozoan and ecdysozoan orthologues, in addition to the plant SOS1 sequences. The non-animal clades CHX, NhaP and plant vacuolar were also resolved. We also found support for two previously unreported animal CAP clades. The first, consisting of deuterostome and lophotrochozoan sequences, is most closely aligned to the plant CHX transporters. No molluscan sequences were identified from this clade. The second was a large lophotrochozoan-specific family of NHEs most closely aligned to the PM-NHEs found in all major animal superphyla. The quagga mussel NHE found to be highly expressed during early embryogenesis (Gene.62031) is a member of this lophotrochozoan-specific NHE family.Protein structural modelling of the embryonically highly expressed Dreissena lophotrochoaquaporin orthologue (Dro.75921) with SWISS-MODEL60 showed that the most structurally variable regions as measured by the QMEAN score corresponded to loops A, C and E. The exception to this was the model-template alignment with AQP1 which also showed strong structural similarity to Dro.75921 through loop D with the QMEAN not dropping below 0.68 [SWISS-MODEL cut-off for low quality equals 0.6 (Supplementary Material SM 7)]. Lens fibre major intrinsic protein, AQP4 and AQP5 have minimum QMEAN scores through loop D of 0.48, 0.48 and 0.58, respectively. Amino acid conservation was considerably higher for the Loop D region of lophotrochoaquaporins than for other classical aquaporins such as AQP4 (Fig. 3c;Supplementary Material SM 7). Loop D amino acids Arg-291 and Asp-293 of Dro.75921 were also predicted to form a salt bridge which acts to stabilize quaternary structure (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Material SM 7).3.5. Embryonic response to osmolarity challengesIn both control (ambient osmolarity) and treated (low and high osmolarity), first cleavage was observed to occur at ~1 hpf with the second and third cleavage occurring at ~1-h intervals. No impact on fertilization or development as a consequence of jelly coat removal was observed. The first cleavage cavity began to form between the two daughter cells shortly after the first cleavage was completed (Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Material SM 8 and Supplementary Movie S1). As has been observed in several species, cleavage cavity formation begins simultaneously at several positions along the cell–cell margin, resulting in small lens-shaped fluid-filled cavities, which gradually grow and coalesce until a single cavity remains. Cleavage cavities often grow to occupy a substantial proportion of the total embryo volume, leaving only a small ring traversing the circumference of the embryo where cell–cell contact remains intact. Eventually, this final ring of contact is breached by the growing cavity whereupon the fluid in the cavity is rapidly discharged, possibly through the release of tension built up in the fertilization envelope. This discharge results in the collapse of the cavity. Cleavage cavities in developing Dreissena embryos.

Color figures are available at DNARES online. The process of cleavage cavity inflation and collapse typically repeats two to four times during each of the first three cleavages. At the eight-cell stage, a central cavity forms and this also appears to periodically inflate and collapse in a similar way to the cleavage cavities (Supplementary Material SM 8). Over the course of observation, most embryos remained at the approximate volume at which they began, notwithstanding the repeated inflation and collapse attributable to cleavage cavity activity. In contrast, those eggs that failed to become fertilized gradually increased in volume over the recording period.In contrast to embryos raised under ambient osmolarity, embryos raised in the high salt solution progressed through the cleavage stages either without the production of cleavage cavities, or, in a few cases, with highly reduced cleavage cavities (Fig. 4e–h; Supplementary Move S2). Zygotes were also observed to reduce in volume prior to the first cleavage before stabilizing (Supplementary Material S8). Embryos raised under low osmotic conditions developed normally and produced large cleavage cavities similar to those in ambient conditions (Fig. 4i–l and Supplementary Material SM 8 and Supplementary Movie S3).On rare occasions under ambient osmotic conditions, cleavage of the embryo fails (Fig. 4m–p; Supplementary Movie S1). We have observed that embryos that are successfully fertilized, as determined by the presence of polar bodies, but fail to cleave correctly, are at an increased risk of fertilization envelope rupture. When the fertilization envelope ruptures, part of the embryo is extruded from the fertilization envelope, leading to the formation of large highly active amoeboid processes that often contain large vacuole-like structures (Supplementary Movie S1).4. DiscussionThrough the sequencing and annotation of the genome of the invasive quagga mussel, we have identified key machinery underlying the capacity for Dreissena to osmoregulate under hypo-osmotic conditions from as early as the two-cell stage of development. The capacity to regulate intercellular osmolarity during embryogenesis was a key step in the evolution of freshwater tolerance in dreissenids and has likely been pivotal to their success as invasive species.High repeat content and heterozygosity levels both pose substantial challenges to contiguous genome assembly and so necessitate appropriate assembly pipelines. These parameters were key to the selection of Platanus28 and Redundans29 as the primary components of the Dreissena genome assembly workflow. The resulting annotated assembly represents one of the most complete bivalve genome assemblies available as measured by BUSCO45 completeness and DNA-seq read re-mapping (Supplementary Material SM 3). The difference of ~360 Mb between the assembled genome (1.24 Gb) and the predicted genome size (~1.6 Gb) is most likely explained by the collapsing or reduction of highly repetitive regions, as has been observed with other genome assemblies.64In order to maintain a body osmolarity above that of the surrounding medium, organisms require mechanisms to either prevent the osmotic influx of water that would otherwise diffuse across membranes, or to excrete excess water that passes into their cells. Likewise, the efflux of small solutes (e.g. Na+, K+ and Cl-) that would otherwise be lost to the environment must be prevented or balanced with uptake to avoid deteriorating osmotic conditions.Many freshwater protozoans are comparable in size to Dreissena embryos and they too require mechanisms to cope with the osmotic pressures of freshwater environments in the absence of complex multicellular excretory organs. Protozoan contractile vacuoles, like lophotrochozoan cleavage cavities, are membrane-bound structures that gradually fill with excess cellular water before rapidly discharging it to the exterior.81,82 Additionally, both molluscan cleavage cavities and protozoan contractile vacuoles are associated with aquaporins and vacuolar ATPases.83Aquaporins are a class of highly selective transmembrane passive water transporters that in animals fall into one of four clades (classical, aquaamoniaporins, aquaglyceroporins or unorthodox/S-aquaporins) based on their function and their capacity to transport specific solutes in addition to or instead of water.68 A fifth group specific to insects, the EGLPs, have been previously assigned to the classical aquaporins,68 however our phylogenetic analyses indicate they may represent a sister group. In humans, aquaporins are associated with a number of pathologies and are important components of the eye, blood–brain-barrier and kidney.84 In molluscs, the diversity and function of aquaporins are less well described although mollusc-specific aquaporin clades have been identified.70,73Dreissena, Corbicula and Limnoperna represent independent invasions of freshwater habitats and all three have close marine relatives8,85 (Supplementary Material SM 4). The lineage-specific aquaporin duplications in these three species reflect this evolutionary history while the aquaporin expansion in the paleoheterodonts appears to have occurred after the divergence of the freshwater unionids from their marine ancestors, but before unionid speciation (Fig. 3b).In addition to facilitating water transport across osmotic gradients, hydrostatic gradients may also influence the directional transport of water by aquaporin channels. In the absence of an osmotic pressure gradient, rat AQP1 channels mediate transmembrane water transport across a hydrostatic pressure gradient86 while human AQP1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes exhibits reversible gating dependent on the surface tension of the membrane.87 In plants, membrane tension-dependent gating of the grapevine aquaporin TIP2;1 has also been observed under hypotonic conditions.88In lophotrochoaquaporins, loop D is highly charged and appears to be highly conserved, with two of the most conserved amino acids (Arg-291 and Asp-293 in Dro.75921) also predicted to form a salt bridge61 (Fig. 3d). In addition to the conductance of water through individual subunit pores, human AQP1 conducts Na+, K+ and Cs+ cations through the central tetrameric pore which is gated by the highly charged cytoplasmic loop D.89–91 Increasing evidence that water and ion conductance of aquaporins can be influenced by factors such as pH,92–95 membrane tension87 and hydrostatic pressure86 suggests that a complex set of dynamic, localized parameters may interact to influence aquaporin activity.The sodium/hydrogen exchanger found to be highly expressed during Dreissena embryogenesis is a member of the plasma-membrane NHEs and thus is likely required for the recovery of sodium lost to the environment across the plasma membrane. Neither the v-ATPase subunits nor the PM-NHEs have undergone an evolutionary pattern of expansion akin to that of the aquaporins in which repeated colonization events of freshwater environments are associated with gene family expansions (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Material SM 6).Cleavage cavity formation has been observed in a wide range of freshwater and terrestrial molluscs21–24,96,97 as well as in the freshwater annelid leech Helobdella.98,99 The freshwater bryozoan Paludicella articulata also appears to form a structures reminiscent of molluscan cleavage cavities.100 In vertebrates, rat hepatocyte couplets induced to secrete bile through the application of the choleretic dibutyryl cAMP rapidly shunt intracellular AQP8 to the membranes at the cell–cell interface.101 This induces the flow of water, forming a fluid-filled intercellular structure (the canaliculus) that also bears a striking resemblance to Dreissena cleavage cavities.The co-occurrence of cleavage cavity formation with high aquaporin and v-ATPase subunit a expression levels indicates a role for these proteins in Dreissena embryonic osmoregulation. While v-ATPases are most well-known for the acidification of intracellular vesicles, their roles in the acidification of extracellular spaces are well established.102,103 It is also significant that the only v-ATPase subunit that is highly up-regulated during cleavage cavity formation is an orthologue of subunit a, as it is this subunit that is responsible for subcellular targeting of the entire v-ATPase complex.92–95The repeated aquaporin expansions in freshwater lophotrochozoans and the importance of aquaporins and v-ATPases to protozoan osmoregulatory structures suggests that this molecular machinery may have been co-opted by both the lophotrochozoan cleavage cavity and the protozoan contractile vacuole excretory systems.In protozoans, the mechanism of contractile vacuole contraction remains elusive. Contractile elements such as actin–myosin-based systems do not appear to be associated with contractile vacuoles, leading some authors to suggest that ‘contractile’ vacuoles are not actually contractile.81 A more recent hypothesis posits that tension built up in the membrane of the contractile vacuole may provide the force required for fluid discharge.104In many animals, post-fertilization physicochemical modifications that transform the vitelline envelope into the fertilization envelope typically result in increased rigidity and stiffness.105–107 While such modifications have not been well described in molluscs, we observed that Dreissena embryos that fail to cleave or to form cleavage cavities under ambient conditions appear to be at increased risk of fertilization envelope rupture (Fig. 4m–p and Supplementary Movie S1). In contrast, unfertilized Dreissena eggs gradually increase in volume, presumably due to the osmotic influx of water, without such a marked increase in susceptibility to vitelline envelope rupture (Supplementary Material SM 8).We suggest a mechanism for Dreissena cleavage cavity filling and discharge whereby the mechanical properties of the fertilization envelope restrict cell expansion in a functionally analogous manner to that of the cell wall of plants. Under such circumstances, an increased turgor pressure induced by the osmotic influx of water triggers the flow of water through the aquaporin channels down a hydrostatic pressure gradient into the developing cleavage cavity. The rapid expulsion of the contents of the cleavage cavity is thus mediated by tension stored in the fertilization envelope in a manner similar to the tension stored in the membranes of protozoan contractile vacuoles.104The deployment of lophotrochoaquaporin water transport channels during early embryogenesis appears to have enabled Dreissena to regulate intercellular water levels as early as the two-cell stage. The ability of Dreissena embryos to excrete excess water via the formation of cleavage cavities is a function that in adult animals is usually reserved for complex organs such as nephridia or kidneys. It is likely that the evolution of this embryonic osmoregulatory mechanism involving aquaporin-mediated cleavage cavity formation was a crucial step in the adaptation of the quagga mussel—and likely many other aquatic animals—to freshwater environments.We would like to thank Paulina Tapia for her watercolour painting and photograph in Figure 1.

IntroductionThe genus Populus comprises around 30 economically and ecologically important species.1 Besides wood products, these species provide a range of services including bioenergy production, carbon sequestration, bioremediation, nutrient cycling, biofiltration, and habitat diversification.2 Due to its modest genome size, rapid growth rate, simple vegetative propagation, and short rotation cycle, coupled to high levels of genetic diversity as well as facile genetic manipulation, this genus has become a model for the study of tree molecular biology.3 Up to now, several high-quality poplar genomes have become available, including P. trichocarpa (Torr. and Gray),4,P. euphratica Oliv,5,P. pruinosa,6 and P. alba var. pyramidalis.7 Unfortunately, these species are not easily transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.8 Interestingly, it seems that only hybrid poplar species, which have much higher transformation rates, have been widely used for genetic transformation, examples including P. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa clone 84K,9,P. tremula x P. alba,10,P. alba x P. grandidentata,11 and P. alba x P. tremula.12White poplar P. alba, commonly called silver poplar, is widely distributed in central Europe and central Asia. It requires abundant light and ample moisture, and stands up well to flooding. Due to its attractive green-and-white leaves, it is often planted as an ornamental tree. Its extensive root system and good tolerance of salt make it an effective tree on windy coasts. This species has also been widely used in short rotation plantation for timber and pulp production. P. tremula, commonly called aspen, is widely distributed in cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is usually found in mountains at high altitudes. P. tremula is a very hardy species and can tolerate long, cold winters. It has been widely planted for timber, firewood, and veneer production. Natural populations of P. alba and P. tremula or its varieties hybridize frequently and have been selected as the parental species for artificial hybrid breeding. Two main hybrids, P. tremula x P. alba and P. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa, have been frequently used in molecular biological studies due to their high rates of transformation. In 2016, Mader et al. reported a 900 Mb draft genome of a female interspecific hybrid P. tremula x P. alba clone INRA 717-1B4, with a N50 contig length of 3,850 bp.13 However, the genome sequence of this hybrid has not been assembled to the level of chromosomes. Evidently, further development of high-quality genome sequences in hybrid poplar species having high transformation efficiencies will be critical to advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering of this woody genus.Here we focus on the clone 84K, a male P. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa interspecific hybrid. This hybrid resulted from a breeding program led by Professor SinKyu Hyun (Seoul National University, Korea), and was first introduced into China in 1984 by Professor Qiwen Zhang (The Research Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing). Attractive characteristics of this interspecific hybrid include a high growth rate and excellent adaptation to diverse environments. This superior clone has been commonly used in short rotation plantation for timber, firewood, and pulp production. More importantly, it is easily accessible for genetic transformation using A. tumefaciens, and this clone is widely used by scientists in transgenic experiments as a model for woody species.14 Many transgenic poplar lines based on this clone have been created for commercial applications in China. Regrettably, no genome sequence is currently available for this clone. In this study, we describe a de novo assembly of the genome sequence of the hybrid poplar (P. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa) clone 84K (poplar 84K, hereafter), and identify two subgenomes via comparison to the genomes of P. alba var. pyramidalis and P. tremula. The genome resources of this hybrid will facilitate further gene functional analyses, optimization of genetic transformation experiments, and poplar breeding practices, as well as comparative genomic analyses across different poplars.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsPoplar 84K (P. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa) was grown in the greenhouse at 20 °C, under a 12-h light/12-h dark illumination cycle. Fresh young leaves were collected from 1-month-old plants and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was isolated for library construction following the steps of the CTAB method described by Doyle et al.15 Total RNA of the leaves and shoots from 1-month-old plants was extracted with TRI Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq).2.2. Genome sequencing and RNA-seqTwo DNA libraries with 270 and 500 bp insertions, and one DNA library with 20 kb insertions were constructed and separately sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and PacBio Sequel platforms. Detailed methods for DNA library construction can be found in Supplementary Materials. For transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), four RNA libraries for leaves and one library for shoots were constructed according to the TrueSeq® RNA Sample Preparation protocol, and were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq sequencing system.2.3. Estimation of genome sizeThe 1C value of poplar 84K was measured using flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) as the DNA stain and Arabidopsis thaliana (col-0) as the standard plant as described previously.16 The genome size of poplar 84K was calculated using the equation provided by the regression analysis and the known A. thaliana 2C DNA content (see Supplementary Materials for details). We also used 28.44 Gb of Illumina NovaSeq short reads to estimate the genome size and other features using the GCE software based on k-mer depth-frequency distribution.17 The versions and main parameters of GCE and other software packages used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table S1.2.4. Assembly of the poplar 84K genome sequencesSMRT subreads were corrected, trimmed, and assembled using CANU18 (see Supplementary Materials for details), and then polished the draft assembly using Arrow.19 Lastly, Pilon20 was used to perform two rounds of error correction using Illumina NovaSeq reads from the 270 and 500 bp insert libraries.2.5. Identification of potential contamination and organelle genomesFor contigs less than 1 Mb, we performed a BLASTN21 search against the non-redundant nucleotide (NT, downloaded on 4 March 2018) database in GenBank with an E-value of 1E-5. Contigs having the most matches to non-plant species were designated as environmental sequence contamination. For the identification of the chloroplast genome, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of P. tremula x P. alba (accession number: NC_028504.1)22 was used as a query to search against all the remaining PacBio contigs with an E-value of 1E-5. The mitochondrial genome of P. tremula x P. alba (accession number: NC_028329.1)22 was chosen to search against all remaining PacBio contigs with an E-value of 1E-5 for mitochondrial fragments. Gene structure annotations and figures of the organelle genomes were produced using GESEQ.232.6. Pseudomolecule constructionHi-C mapping was employed to facilitate pseudomolecule construction and the details were described in Supplementary Materials. The PacBio contigs were divided into fragments having a length of 300 kb, and were then error corrected, clustered, ordered, and orientated by the LACHESIS software24 operating on the valid interaction read pair dataset. Finally, contact maps were plotted using the HiCPlotter software.252.7. Evaluation of genome completeness, continuity, and accuracyTo evaluate the completeness of genome assembly, we checked the mapping rates by aligning RNA-seq reads from five libraries and DNA short reads from four libraries to the final assembly using HISAT226 and BWA-MEM,27 respectively, and performed BUSCO analysis.28 We assessed the continuity of the final assembly of poplar 84K along with two other poplar genomes, P. trichocarpa4 and P. deltoides (assembly version 2.1, produced by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute in collaboration with the user community), using LTR_retriever29 by calculating the LTR Assembly Index (LAI) score that evaluates the de novo assembly quality of intergenic and repetitive regions. Raw LAI is defined as the ratio of intact LTR retrotransposon length to total LTR sequence length.29 After standardization, the corrected LAI can be used as a reference-free genome metric regardless of genome size, LTR retrotransposon content, and gene content completeness.29 The accuracy of the final assembly was estimated by aligning Illumina short reads using BWA-MEM27 and GATK30 to call variants.2.8. Gene prediction and annotationTandem repeats within the poplar 84K genome were identified with Tandem Repeat Finder.31 To identify known transposable elements (TEs), we used RepeatMasker,32 loaded with the Repbase33 and the Dfam34 library databases, Homology-based ncRNA annotation was performed by mapping plant miRNA and snRNA genes from the Rfam database (release 14.0)35 to the poplar 84K genome using infernal.36 tRNAscan-SE37 was used for tRNA annotation. RNAmmer38 was used to predict rRNAs and their subunits. Protein-coding genes were predicted based on transcriptomic, homologous, and de novo methods, the details of which along with functional annotation of the predicted gene models were described in Supplementary Materials.2.9. Subgenome assignmentThe chromosome pairs were firstly identified with MCScanX,39 based on protein collinearity between all the 38 Hi-C linkage groups in poplar 84K and all the 19 chromosomes of P. trichocarpa. The pairwise relationship of the chromosomes was further confirmed by their DNA-level collinearity identified using nucmer.40 For each chromosome pair, the chromosomes derived from the parental species were distinguished by similarity to the genomes of related species P. alba var. pyramidalis7 and P. tremula,41 and were assigned to subgenome A and G, respectively.2.10. Evolutionary analysis of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomePhylogenetic tree reconstruction of chloroplast and mitochondrial protein coding regions was described in Supplementary Materials. The organelle-DNA similar fragments in nuclear genome were detected using BLASTN with the chloroplast and mitochondrial contigs as query to search against poplar 84K genome. The parameters of BLASTN and the filtration setting were as described previously.422.11. Analysis of genome collinearity and variation between subgenome A and GCollinear blocks between subgenome A and subgenome G were determined using MCscanX39 and plotted with Circos,43 treating at least eight genes as a collinear block. We further aligned the DNA sequences of the two subgenomes using nucmer,40 and only retained uniquely anchored sequences larger than 10 kb for variance calling by the Assemblytics software.442.12. Transcriptional profiles of the allelic genes in subgenomesBeing that the RNA-seq experiments performed in this study did not contain replicates and were from few tissues, we downloaded the RNA-seq datasets of four tissues in poplar 84K and of four tissues in P. tremula x P. alba from GenBank SRA database (Supplementary Table S2) and mapped them to the genome of poplar 84K by HISAT2.26 Gene expression values were calculated with FPKM and TMP values using the Stringtie software.45 Allelic genes determined by MCSCANX, and those showing transcriptional bias between subgenome A and G were identified using edgeR46 with a 4-fold change and a P-value of <0.05. The qRT-PCR method was described in Supplementary Materials.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assembly and identification of potential contamination and organelle genomesTwo DNA libraries carrying 270 and 500 bp insertions, and one DNA library carrying 20 kb insertions were constructed and separately sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and PacBio Sequel platforms, producing 56.3 Gb (Supplementary Table S3a) and 48.4 Gb (Supplementary Table S3b) data. The mean and N50 of PacBio subread lengths were 8.1 kb and 13.7 kb, respectively (Supplementary Table S3b, Fig. S1). The haploid genome size of poplar 84K was estimated to be 470.155 ± 5.94 Mb by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2, Table S4) and 427.2 Mb based on k-mer depth distribution (Supplementary Fig. S3). Heterozygosity was estimated to be 2.16% using GCE software.17 A 753.8-Mb genome assembly of poplar 84K was constructed (Table 1), comprising 1,384 contigs and a contig N50 of 2.24 Mb. The difference between assembly size and estimated genome size may be due to the heterozygous character of poplar 84K and was investigated further in the following analysis. To remove fungal and bacterial DNA contamination, for 1,142 contigs less than 1 Mb (total 157,986,688 bp), we performed a BLASTN21 search against the non-redundant nucleotide (NT) database in GenBank with an E-value of 1E-5. A total of 5,264,546 bp from 114 contigs were identified as bacterial or fungal contamination, and was excluded from further analysis. Three contigs with length of 40,693, 115,255, and 64,703 bp were found with high identities to the chloroplast sequence of P. tremula x P. alba (NC_028504.1).22 The chloroplast genome (156,462 bp) was then assembled from these contigs based on a collinear relationship with the chloroplast sequence of P. tremula x P. alba (NC_028504.1).22 One contig of 874,696 bp was found to encode the mitochondrial genome. Gene structure annotations and figures of the organelle genomes were produced using GESEQ (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5).23 After assignment of microbial contamination and organelles, 747.5 Mb from poplar 84K nuclear genome were obtained. With the 95.2 Gb clean reads generated by Hi-C sequencing (Supplementary Table S3d), a total of 1,042 contigs were clustered into 38 groups for pseudomolecule construction. Of these, 544 contigs, with total length of 710 Mb, were ordered and oriented in all linkage groups (Fig. 1a, Table 1). Assessment of the assembled 84K genome. (a) Interaction frequency distributions of Hi-C linkage groups. The log2 of the valid interaction link number of Hi-C data between any pair of 500 kb non-overlapping bins were calculated and is displayed as a heatmap by HiCPlotter.25 The black/white bar of the heatmap indicates the interaction frequency of the Hi-C links. The square indicates the abnormal high frequency of interaction between linkage group 35 (chromosome 11 of subgenome G) and linkage group 10 (chromosome 12 in subgenome A).

BUSCO analysis27 showed that 1,386 (96.3%) of 1,440 plant single-copy orthologues were complete, but 1,291 (93.1%) of them presented as duplicated copies. Similar percentages of the 1,440 plant single-copy orthologues were detected in P. trichocarpa,4,P. alba var. Pyramidalis,7 and P. tremula,41 and at least 85.1% of them were single copy in these species (Fig. 1b). This suggested that the heterozygous regions were obtained, based on which these heterozygous regions could be separated using their parental genome information.We assessed the continuity of the final assembly of poplar 84K in comparison to two poplar reference genomes, P. trichocarpa4 and P. deltoides (assembly version 2.1, produced by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute in collaboration with the user community). The standardized LAI scores are 9.34 in P. trichocarpa, 7.95 in P. deltoides, and 14.79 in poplar 84K. This implies the poplar 84K assembly has achieved reference genome quality.The accuracy of the final assembly was estimated by aligning Illumina short reads using BWA-MEM27 and GATK30 to call variants. A total of 318 homozygous SNPs and 6,398 homozygous INDELs were considered as errors, and 35,735 heterozygous SNPs and 24,860 heterozygous INDELs were found.3.3. Genome annotation and subgenome assignmentWe identified 184.0 Mb of TE sequence (24.4% of the assembly) (Supplementary Table S6). The largest class of TEs comprised retrotransposons, accounting for 18.2% of the assembly, and consisted mostly of Gypsy and Copia retrotransposon families. DNA transposons accounted for 3.8% of the assembly. These analyses also identified 1,983 miRNAs, 1,312 tRNAs, 1,140 rRNAs, and 1,126 snRNAs (Supplementary Table S7).Four RNA libraries for leaves and one library for shoots were constructed, and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform, generating 145.8 million pair reads for genome annotation (Supplementary Table S3c). Finally, 85,755 consensus protein-coding genes were predicted, the average gene length, average transcript length, average CDS length, and exon number per gene being 2,948 bp, 2,937 bp, 1,075 bp and 4.48, respectively (Supplementary Table S8). Functional annotation of the predicted protein-coding genes revealed that 72,574 of the total of 85,755 genes (84.6%) could be assigned putative functions (Supplementary Table S9).Chromosome pairs were first identified based on protein collinearity between all the 38 Hi-C linkage groups in poplar 84K and all the 19 chromosomes of P. trichocarpa (Supplementary Fig. S6). The pairwise relationship of the chromosomes was further confirmed by their DNA-level collinearity (Supplementary Fig. S7). For each chromosome pair, the chromosomes derived from the parental species were distinguished by similarity to the genomes of related species P. alba var. pyramidalis and P. tremula (Supplementary Fig. S8).The chromosome numbering and orientation were determined by comparison to P. trichocarpa (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S10). Ultimately, 356 Mb from female parental species P. alba and 354 Mb from male parental species P. tremula var. glandulosa were obtained, and were designated as subgenome A and subgenome G. BUSCO analysis indicated each subgenome has characteristics similar to those of P. trichocarpa, P. alba var. pyramidalis and P. tremula (Fig. 1b), which implies high completeness of the two subgenomes. Specifically, the numbers of duplicated genes dropped from 1,291 (89.7%) to 187 in subgenome A and to 186 in subgenome G. This supports our previous speculation that combination of two haploid genomes causes the assembly size to increase by 30%.3.4. Characteristics of the poplar 84K genomeThe characteristics of the two subgenomes, along with sequencing depths, are shown in Fig. 2, including the chromosome length, gene density, TE content, GC content, and location of collinear regions. Chromosome 11 of subgenome G (6.54 Mb) was much shorter than that of subgenome A (17.42 Mb) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S10). This may be due to large fragment loss during inter-species hybridization and/or subsequent chromosome stabilization, or defects of the current assembly algorithm in dealing with the regions with high identities. Another anomalous region is a 6.92 Mb fragment at the 5' end of chromosome 12 of subgenome A, which showed a doubled sequencing depth as compared with other regions (Fig. 2). This 6.92 Mb region also showed a high frequency of interaction with the short chromosome 11 of subgenome G (Fig. 1a). We speculate that one additional 6.92 Mb region derived from recent large DNA fragment duplication may be responsible for the connection to chromosome 11 of subgenome G.

The tree topology indicated that P. trichocarpa is closely related to P. balsamifera and P. fremontii (Supplementary Fig. S9), consistent with previous studies.19P. yunnanensis formed a clade with P. alba, P. tremula and P. tremula x P. alba, within which the poplar 84K genome formed a sister branch with the genome of P. alba (Supplementary Fig. S9). The mitochondrial genome in poplar 84K also showed maternal inheritance in that they were mostly related to those from P. alba (Supplementary Fig. S10).The lateral transfer of organelle fragments into the nuclear genome has been widely reported in plants. To get an insight into the scale of such transfer and to exclude the possibility of misidentification of organelle genome in poplar 84K, we analysed the insertion times, sequence identities, and maximum and total lengths of organelle-DNA similar fragments in the nuclear genome. About 2,234 and 2,093 insertions with total length of 533 kb and 530 kb of chloroplast sequences, and 3,916 and 3,844 insertions with total length of 597.2 kb and 625.6 kb of mitochondrial sequences were found in all the chromosomes of subgenome A and G, respectively (Supplementary Table S11). The mean insertion lengths were 236 bp for chloroplasts and 155 bp for mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S11). The longest chloroplast and mitochondrial insertion lengths were 15.2 kb (98.9% identity) and 19.1 kb (98.1% identity), respectively. The statistics of organelle-DNA similar fragments in the nuclear genome of poplar 84K were similar to the previous report of P. trichocarpa.42We performed orthologous assignment and gene family comparison in the two poplar 84K subgenomes and four other Populus species using OrthoFinder.47 Total of 30,342 clusters were obtained in them, among which 17,690 (58.30%) were shared by the four genomes and two poplar 84K subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. S12).3.5. Genome collinearity and variation between subgenome A and GAbout 323 Mb of regions of collinearity, including 28,974 allelic gene pairs, were identified between the two subgenomes (90.7% of subgenome A and 91.2% of subgenome G). We then aligned the DNA sequences of the two subgenomes and only retained uniquely anchored sequences larger than 10 kb for variant calling. We found 5,398,437 SNPs and 1,108,357 indels (1 bp–10 kb) in these collinear regions. These variations within allelic genes would influence their gene structures, expression patterns, functions, and regulation, which together contribute the morphologic and physiologic characteristics of hybrid 84K.3.6. Transcriptional bias of the allelic genes in the two subgenomesWe further explored the expressional bias of allelic genes in the two subgenomes by mapping RNA-seq data of four tissues from 84K and four tissues from backcross hybrid P. tremula x P. alba to the poplar 84 genome assembly (Supplementary Table S2). Of all the 28,974 allelic gene pairs, 6,780 gene pairs were found with transcriptional bias in poplar 84K, and 5,349 in P. tremula x P. alba (Fig. 3a and b, Supplementary Table S12). Among these allelic genes with transcriptional bias, 2,121 gene pairs showed bias in all four tissue in poplar 84K, the corresponding number in P. tremula x P. alba being 1,166 (Fig. 3a and b). We further calculated the number of genes that showed transcriptional bias to subgenomes A and G in two hybrids. Interestingly, we found more than 54.4% of allelic genes showed transcriptional bias to subgenome G, and less than 45.6% of allelic genes to subgenome A in all the tissues that were used (Table 2), which implies subgenome G plays a more important role during the growth process in both hybrids. We selected four allelic gene pairs and performed qRT-PCR analysis in shoots and leaves, which showed expression patterns that were consistent with the RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. S13, Table S13). The similarities of promoters were additionally analysed between the allelic pairs showing expression bias. The result indicated that a higher divergence in promoter regions was present in the allelic pairs having expression bias than those without detectable expression bias (Fig. 3c).

Significant differences of identity between allelic genes with transcriptional bias and no-bias were supported by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (P-value < 0.001) in poplar 84K and P. tremula x P. alba.Genes with transcriptional bias within different tissues in two poplar hybridsP. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa = 84K.Genes with transcriptional bias within different tissues in two poplar hybridsP. alba x P. tremula var. glandulosa = 84K.Further examination uncovered 285 allelic gene pairs with bias to subgenome A (Supplementary Fig. S14a) and 339 with bias toward subgenome G, for all the tissues and in both hybrids (Supplementary Fig. S14b). These genes might be essential, playing important functions in both hybrids. Gene enrichment analysis of these two datasets revealed that protein metabolic process and nitrogen compound metabolic process were represented in both subgenomes. Subgenome A has more allelic gene pairs in the categories of monovalent inorganic cation transport and chromatin organization, whereas subgenome G has more in the categories of mRNA processing, ncRNA metabolic process, and sulphur compound metabolic process. As for their cellular component classifications, allelic gene pairs showing bias to subgenome A function in mitochondria and the nucleoplasm, and those in subgenome G play roles in plastids, endosomes, vesicles, and ribosomes (Supplementary Table S14). This implies these genes function in different cellular compartments and different biological processes. More transcriptome data will be needed to obtain further insights into the transcriptional bias of each subgenome in different developmental stages under different stresses.4. Summary and conclusionsWe employed PacBio single-molecular real-time sequencing and Hi-C technology to generate a reference sequence of the poplar 84K (Populus alba x Populus tremula var. glandulosa) genome. The genome sequences were assembled into the chromosome levels, with a contig N50 size of 1.99 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 19.6 Mb. About 356 Mb from the female parental species (P. alba) and 354 Mb from the male parental species (P. tremula var. glandulosa) were assigned. The two subgenomes showed high collinearity over 323 Mb. The allelic gene pairs with transcriptional bias toward subgenome A or G function in different cellular compartments and different biological processes. More allelic gene pairs showed transcriptional bias toward subgenome G in poplar 84K and another widely used hybrid P. tremula x P. alba. The dominant expression of subgenome G indicates that it plays a more important role than subgenome A during hybrid growth. The high-quality genome of poplar 84K provides an important gene resource for poplar breeding and molecular biology research.Data availabilityThe sequencing reads from each sequencing library have been deposited at NCBI with the Project ID PRJNA556338 and CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive (CNSA) with the Project ID CNP0000339.

IntroductionBrassica rapa L. encompasses commercially important vegetable crops including Chinese cabbage (var. pekinensis), pak choi (var. chinensis), and turnip (var. rapa) as well as oilseed crops (var. oleifera). The B. rapa genome has undergone a whole-genome triplication resulting in multiple copies of paralogous genes. Three subgenomes, the least fractioned (LF) subgenome and two more fractionated subgenomes (MF1 and MF2), are recognized within the B. rapa genome.1Activity levels of the component genes of the genomes are regulated by transcription factors and epigenetic modifications. The regulation of gene expression by epigenetic modification is crucial for the development and adaptation of plants to changing environments.2,3 Epigenetic modifications refer mainly to DNA methylation and covalent modifications of the histone proteins. The tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 have been associated with transcriptional activation, and H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 with gene silencing.4,5H3K27me3 modification is catalyzed by the POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2), which is composed of a subset of the polycomb group (PcG) proteins.6 In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27me3 sites occur in euchromatin and not in transposable elements (TEs) or heterochromatin.7,8 In plants, H3K27me3 regions are usually limited to single genes, rarely extending into adjacent genes.8–10 Conservation of H3K27me3 sites between lines has been observed in A. thaliana, rice, and maize.9–11 The chromosomal distribution of the H3K27me3 sites in the histones of genomes of different plant species provides data on the possible conservation of H3K27me3 sites and effect on gene activity.6 H3K27me3 preferentially marks repressed or lowly expressed genes in A. thaliana, rice, and maize.12,13 The level of H3K27me3 can vary between tissues at the same gene locus.8,10,14–16In A. thaliana, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a key determinant of vernalization, which is the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a prolonged low temperature treatment.17,FLC encodes a MADS box DNA-binding protein, which acts as a floral repressor of SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT).18–20 Without prolonged cold exposure, FLC is expressed. With cold exposure chromatin structure at FLC is remodelled from an active to a repressed state. H3K27me3 levels are increased following vernalization, this is catalyzed by the VERNALIZATION (VRN) complex, one of several PRC2 complexes, and FLC expression is reduced.21,22 The FLC protein belongs to a MADS-box protein family, which contains five other members, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 1–5 (MAF1–MAF5). MAF1–MAF4 are repressed by vernalization, and the repression in each case is associated with an increase of H3K27me3 level.23The control of flowering is a critical property for the Chinese cabbage crop.24 Chinese cabbage is generally vernalization sensitive and can respond to cold exposure during seed germination.25–27 In the absence of vernalization, most Chinese cabbage lines do not bolt before 6 months after sowing.27 There are four FLC paralogs (BrFLC1, BrFLC2, BrFLC3, and BrFLC5) in the genome,28 and all can be repressed by vernalization treatment in some Chinese cabbage lines.29–32In the present study, two inbred lines of Chinese cabbage, RJKB-T23 (T23) and RJKB-T24 (T24) show high sequence similarity to the reference genome of B. rapa var. pekinensis Chiifu-401-42 version 1.5,28 have similar genetic distances to the reference genome,33 and are parents of the commercial F1 hybrid cultivar, ‘W77’. We compared the distribution of H3K27me3 in the cotyledons and earliest leaves of these parental inbred lines to investigate the role of H3K27me3 in tissue-specific gene expression. We found more similarity of distribution between the two parental lines than between different tissues within a line. In paralogous gene families and 14-day tissue, the presence of H3K27me3 was associated with tissue-specific gene expression. We showed that H3K27me3 plays an important role in the regulation of FLC paralogous genes in the vernalization process of B. rapa.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsTwo Chinese cabbage inbred lines (B. rapa var. pekinensis), RJKB-T23 (T23)/R09 and RJKB-T24 (T24)/S11,34,35 and the C24 accession of A. thaliana were used. The genetic relationship between RJKB-T23 and RJKB-T24 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. B. rapa seeds were surface sterilized and grown on agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates with 1% (w/v) sucrose under long day (LD) condition (16 h light) at 22 °C. Plants were harvested at 2 and 14 days after sowing [2 days; cotyledons (2d-C), 14 days; 1st and 2nd leaves (14d-L)] for expression and ChIP analyses (Supplementary Fig. S2). A. thaliana seeds were surface sterilized and grown on MS with 3% (w/v) sucrose agar medium. After a 2-day stratification period at 4 °C, seedlings were grown at 22 °C under LD condition (16 h light) for 12 days.T23 and T24 respond to cold exposure (below 10 °C) and are both seed vernalization-responsive type. They do not flower within 4 months of sowing without vernalization. For vernalizing cold treatments in T24, seeds were surface sterilized and placed on agar-solidified MS plates with 1% (w/v) sucrose for 4 weeks at 4 °C under LD condition (16 h light). Plant materials were harvested at the end of 4 weeks cold treatment (cotyledons/BrV1) at which time the developmental stage was similar to seedlings at 2 days after sowing under normal growth conditions (2d-C). After 4 weeks of vernalization, seedlings were grown for 12 days using normal growth condition (1st and 2nd leaves/BrV2) at which time the developmental stage was similar to seedlings at 14 days after sowing under normal growth conditions (14d-L).The C24 accession of A. thaliana is a vernalization-sensitive and seed vernalization-responsive type.36 For vernalization, C24 seeds were exposed to 4 °C for 4 weeks then grown at 22 °C under LD for 10 days (V) at which time the developmental stage was similar to seedlings at 12 days after sowing under normal growth conditions (NV).2.2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencingChromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments were performed as described by Buzas et al.37 One gram of cotyledons or 1st and 2nd leaves of B. rapa or seedlings of A. thaliana was used for ChIP analysis, and anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, 07-449) antibodies were used. In B. rapa, before the ChIP-seq, we validated the enrichment of purified immunoprecipitated DNAs by qPCR using the positive and negative control primer sets of H3K27me3 previously developed (Supplementary Fig. S3, Table S1).31 Purified immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA in B. rapa were sequenced by Hiseq2000 (36 bp single end). ChIP DNA fragments and input DNA in A. thaliana were sequenced by Illumina with an Illumina Genome Analyzer (GAII). Low quality reads or adapter sequences were purged from the ChIP-seq reads using cutadapt version 1.7.1 and Trim Galore! version 0.3.7. The reads were mapped to the B. rapa reference genome v.1.5 (http://brassicadb.org/brad/) or to the A. thaliana reference genome (TAIR 10) using Bowtie2 version 2.2.3 (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The two replicates of 14-day 1st and 2nd leaves in B. rapa showed high correlation (Supplementary Fig. S4), thus these two data sets were combined. The mapped reads on the interspersed repeat regions (IRRs), such as the TEs detected by RepeatMasker, were examined.ChIP-qPCR was performed using a LightCycler Nano (Roche). The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche). PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, and melting program (60 °C to 95 °C at 0.1 °C/s). After amplification cycles, each reaction was subjected to melt temperature analysis to confirm single amplified products. Data presented are the average and standard error (SE) from three biological and experimental replications. Enrichment of H3K27me3 marks was calculated by comparing the target gene and non-H3K27me3-marked genes by qPCR using immunoprecipitated DNA as a template. The difference between primer pairs was corrected by calculating the difference observed by qPCR amplifying the input DNA as a template. Primer sequences used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Detection of H3K27me3 peaks by model-based analysis for ChIP-seqWe performed peak calling on alignment results using model-based analysis for ChIP-seq (MACS) 2 2.1.0 and identified the regions having H3K27me3 peaks. The MACS callpeak was used with the following options: effective genome size: 2.30e + 08, band width: 200, model fold: 10–30, tag size: 36. The cut-off of P-value, 1.00e-05, was used to call significant peaks. H3K27me3-marked genes were defined as genes that had a more than 200-bp length peak within a genic region (exon–intron) including 200 bp upstream and downstream. The number of H3K27me3 peaks in B. rapa and A. thaliana is shown in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, respectively. We validated H3K27me3-marked genes by ChIP-qPCR of genes that have been identified previously (Supplementary Fig. S5).312.4. Identification of differentially marked H3K27me3 genesTo statistically identify the difference of H3K27me3 genic regions between lines, tissues, or between non-vernalized and vernalized samples, mapped reads on a target region that contains a gene, 200 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream were counted. The number of ChIP-seq reads mapped on a target region was then normalized with signal extraction scaling (SES) method.38 Statistical significance of differences between samples was determined by Fisher’s exact test. The regions that showed significant differences of H3K27me3 level were selected with more than |log 2| = 2.0, q-value < 0.05 and, with significant H3K27me3 peaks.2.5. Calculation of tissue specificity by T-valueWe used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets that contain root, stem, leaf, flower, silique and callus samples.39 The tissue specificity index T (T-value) was computed in each gene according to the formula as described in Tong et al.392.6. Identification of SNPs in B. rapa genesWe performed whole genome resequences in T23 and T24.33 The reads of two lines were mapped to the B. rapa reference genome v.1.5 using Bowtie2 version 2.2.3. We used Picard v.2.9.0 ‘MarkDuplicates’ command to remove duplication. Samtools v1.7 ‘mpileup’ command with -q 20 -Q 30 options and bcftools v1.7 ‘call’ command with -p 0.9 -v -c -O z options were performed to make VCF files. The identification of SNPs was performed using bcftools ‘view’ command with -v snps -g hom options. SNPs that have more than 10 reads were used for subsequent analyses. The number of SNPs per nucleotide length was measured for each gene.2.7. Gene ontology analysisAnalysis for enrichment of gene functional ontology terms was completed using the gene ontology (GO) tool agriGO40 following the methods described by Shimizu et al.41 Statistical tests for enrichment of functional terms used the hypergeometric test and false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing to a level of 1% FDR.2.8. RNA extraction and qPCRTotal RNA was isolated from cotyledons (2d-C, BrV1) or 1st and 2nd leaves (14d-L, BrV2) using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng total RNA using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (Toyobo). qPCR was performed by the same methods as the ChIP-qPCR using the cDNA as a template. The relative expression level of each gene relative to ACTIN42 was automatically calculated using automatic CQ calling according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). Data presented are the average and SE from three biological and experimental replicates. Primer sequences used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1.In BrV1 and BrV2, the region covering part of the BrFLC gene was amplified using primers, which can amplify all BrFLC paralogs (BrFLC1, BrFLC2, BrFLC3, BrFLC5), using cDNA as templates. PCR was performed using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s. Primer sequences used for RT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.9. RNA sequencingRNA-seq using 2-day cotyledons and 14-day leaves with two replicates was performed in T23 and T24 (100 nt read length with paired end on an Illumina HiSeqTM 2000) conditions. The number of clean reads and the percentage of mapped reads are shown in Supplementary Table S6. Low quality reads were filtered using FaQCs Version 1.34.43 HISAT244 was used to align the sequence data sets to Brapa_sequence_v1.5 (http://brassicadb.org/brad/). Cuffdiff was used for the gene expression levels scored by fragments per kilo-base per million (FPKM) and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with two criteria, 2-fold difference (log 2 ratio = 1.0) and 95% confidence. The level of gene expression was categorized into seven groups using log 2 score of FPKM, e.g. Group-6 (highest), log 2 score of FPKM (x) is greater than 9.0; Group-5, 6.0<=x < 9.0; Group-4, 3.0<=x < 6.0; Group-3, 0.0<=x < 3.0; Group-2, -3.0<=x < 0.0; Group-1, x<-3.0; Group-0 (lowest), no read.31,453. Results3.1. The two parental lines of B. rapa have conserved sites of H3K27me3 but H3K27me3 differs between tissuesThe diversity and conservation of H3K27me3 distribution between parental lines of the commercial F1 hybrid cultivar of Chinese cabbage (T23 and T24) were determined. The presence of H3K27me3 marks on the chromatin of 2-day cotyledons (2d-C) and 14-day leaves (14d-L) in the parental lines was mapped by ChIP-seq (Supplementary Table S2). Reads mapped in the genic regions were classified into 2 kb upstream, exon, intron, and 2 kb downstream segments. The proportions of reads in each of these segments were similar to those in the input DNA (Supplementary Fig. S6, Table S7), suggesting there is no preferential location of H3K27me3 in any of the coding or regulating regions. H3K27me3 was enriched in the transcribed region in both 2-day cotyledon and 14-day leaf samples in both lines, especially around the transcription start sites (Fig. 1A). The percentage of reads in the IRRs (TEs and repeats) was lower than in the input DNA (Supplementary Table S2). There was no enrichment in IRR sequences or their flanking regions (Fig. 1B).

RPM: reads per million mapped reads.We found a similar pattern of H3K27me3 distribution in the parental lines in two different tissues (2-day cotyledons and 14-day leaves) at the whole genome level (Supplementary Fig. S7A). We defined an H3K27me3-marked gene as having a peak of more than 200 bp within the genic region, which includes 200 bp upstream and downstream sequences (see Section 2). A total of 17,027 H3K27me3-marked genes were common to the two parental lines in the 2-day cotyledons, and 10,456 H3K27me3-marked genes in the 14-day leaf samples were present in both lines (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table S8). The 2-day cotyledon sample contained most of the marked 14-day genes as well as 2-day cotyledon specific sites (Fig. 2B). A total of 7,930 H3K27me3-marked genes were present in 2-day cotyledon and 14-day leaf samples in both lines and were termed H3K27me3 stably marked genes. In these genes, H3K27me3 was enriched throughout the transcribed region (Fig. 1C). Comparison of H3K27me3 between lines or between tissues.

(C) Percentage of genes showing different H3K27me3 levels between lines in both tissues or between tissues in both lines. (D) Number of genes showing different H3K27me3-marked genes between lines in both tissues or between tissues in both lines.We compared H3K27me3 levels by the number of ChIP-seq reads that had been normalized using SES (see Section 2).38 The two parental lines showed few differences in H3K27me3 distribution in the same tissue contrasting to the differences between 2-day cotyledons and 14-day leaves (Fig. 2C and D, Supplementary Table S9). In genic regions, the correlation coefficient between tissues was lower than between lines (Supplementary Fig. S7B).3.2. At 14 days but not 2 days, genes marked with H3K27me3 had lower levels of transcriptionThere was a higher number of H3K27me3-marked genes in 2-day cotyledons compared with 14-day leaves (Supplementary Table S8). We examined whether these differences affected the transcriptome. We assigned genes into seven groups on the basis of their expression level in 14-day leaves of the two lines.31,41,45 Using the same criteria, we also categorized gene expression levels from a transcriptome of 2-day cotyledon material in each of the two lines (Supplementary Fig. S8).In both the 2-day cotyledon and 14-day leaf samples in both lines, the proportion of H3K27me3-marked genes classified into each of the seven activity groups differs significantly from the distribution in the total transcriptome (Chi-squared test, P < 10-10) (Supplementary Fig. S8). In the 2-day cotyledon samples, H3K27me3-marked genes were less frequently classified in Group-0 to -3 (low expression levels) and more frequently in Group-4 to -6 (high expression levels) (Supplementary Fig. S8). The average transcription level of H3K27me3-marked genes was higher than that of genes without H3K27me3 or in all of the genes in the two lines (Fig. 3). In contrast, in 14-day leaf material H3K27me3-marked genes had decreased numbers in Group-4 to -6 and increased numbers in Group-0 to -3 (Supplementary Fig. S8). The average transcription level of H3K27me3-marked genes was lower than that of genes without H3K27me3 or the total genes in both lines (Fig. 3). The average transcription level of H3K27me3 stably marked genes was lower than that of genes without H3K27me3 or than total genes in both tissues and lines (Fig. 3); the lower expression level could be due to the highly enriched H3K27me3 mark throughout gene body regions (Fig. 1C).

FPKM: fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, 2d-C: 2-day cotyledons, 14d-L: 14-day leaves.Contrary to expectation, H3K27me3-marked genes in 2-day cotyledons showed higher gene expression than those without marks (Fig. 3). These genes included 9,700 genes that had H3K27me3 only in 2-day cotyledons. The overall level of H3K27me3 was lower in the 2-day sample than in the 14-day sample, and H3K27me3 marks were significantly lower in the 3' regions (Fig. 1D). Genes having H3K27me3 marks only in 2-day cotyledons were further decreased in the H3K27me3 level in the 3' regions (Fig. 1E). The expected negative correlation between H3K27me3-marked genes and reduced expression was masked in the 2-day data because there are both highly expressed genes with a low level of H3K27me3 and lowly expressed genes with a higher level of H3K27me3.3.3. H3K27me3 is associated with tissue-specific gene expressionIn genes having different levels of H3K27me3 in the parental lines, 33.1% (241 of 729 genes in 2-day cotyledons) and 22.3% (200 of 898 genes in 14-day leaves) of genes showed differential expression levels (Supplementary Table S10). From 7.8% to 12.7% of these genes showed a negative correlation between H3K27me3 levels and expression levels between lines (Supplementary Table S10). There was a high proportion of genes with parallel levels of expression and of H3K27me3 (Supplementary Table S10), suggesting that the difference in expression between lines does not result from a difference in H3K27me3 level. In genes with different levels of H3K27me3 between tissues, approximately 60% of genes showed differential expression (Supplementary Table S10). More genes (from 13.3% to 19.8%) showed a negative correlation between a difference of H3K27me3 levels and expression levels between tissues, especially in genes showing higher H3K27me3 levels in 14-day leaves than in 2-day cotyledons (Supplementary Table S10).A tissue specificity index, T-value, which interpolates the entire range between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for strictly one tissue-specific genes, was calculated using the transcriptome data from six different tissues in B. rapa.39 We found H3K27me3-marked genes showed significantly higher average T-values compared with total genes (Fig. 4), suggesting that H3K27me3 has a role in tissue-specific gene expression. Tissue specificity of expression in genes having a H3K27me3 mark. A tissue specificity index, T-value, which interpolates the entire range between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for strictly one-tissue-specific genes, was calculated using the transcriptome data in six different tissues in B. rapa. ‘K27+’ and ‘K27*’ represent the H3K27me3-marked genes and H3K27me3 stably marked genes, respectively.Tissue specificity of expression in genes having a H3K27me3 mark. A tissue specificity index, T-value, which interpolates the entire range between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for strictly one-tissue-specific genes, was calculated using the transcriptome data in six different tissues in B. rapa. ‘K27+’ and ‘K27*’ represent the H3K27me3-marked genes and H3K27me3 stably marked genes, respectively.3.4. Comparison of H3K27me3 states between paralogous genes in B. rapaWe compared H3K27me3 locations between paralogs in 14-day leaf samples using 5,439 and 1,675 genes with two or three syntenic copies.1 Among the 1,675 three-copy sets, 265 had H3K27me3 in all three copies, 164 had H3K27me3 in at least two copies, 262 had H3K27me3 in at least one copy, and 984 sets did not have H3K27me3 in any copies (Fig. 5A). Among the 5,439 two-copy pairs, 796 pairs had H3K27me3 in both copies, 938 pairs had H3K27me3 in one copy, and 3,705 pairs did not have H3K27me3 in any copies (Fig. 5A). Totally, 1,225 pairs (= 265 + 164 + 796) showed conservation of H3K27me3 among paralogs, termed paralogous-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes, and 1,200 pairs (=262 + 938) showed H3K27me3 in one of the paralogs, termed copy-specific H3K27me3-marked genes (Fig. 5A).

(D) GO analysis using species-conserved and Br-specific H3K27me3-marked genes.GO analysis showed that genes categorized into ‘Transcription factor activity’, ‘Regulation of metabolic process’, and ‘Developmental process’ were overrepresented in paralogous-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes compared with copy-specific H3K27me3-marked genes (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Table S11). Genes categorized into ‘Plasma membrane’ and ‘Vacuole’ were overrepresented in copy-specific H3K27me3-marked genes compared with paralogous-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Table S11).We examined whether a difference in H3K27me3 states between paralogs was associated with a different level of gene activity. Between paralogous pairs, the average expression levels of genes with H3K27me3 marks was lower than those without H3K27me3 in 14-day leaves of both T23 and T24 (Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating that the presence of H3K27me3 results in a difference of gene expression level between paralogous pairs. There was no difference in T-values between paralogous-conserved and copy-specific H3K27me3-marked genes, and T-values were higher than that in total genes (Fig. 4). Between paralogous pairs, the average T-values of genes with H3K27me3 was significantly higher than that without H3K27me3 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S10), suggesting an association of H3K27me3 with tissue-specific gene expression differences between paralogous pairs.3.5. Some genes marked with H3K27me3 are shared between B. rapa and A. thalianaTo gain information about conservation of H3K27me3 states beyond B. rapa, we compared the genes marked with H3K27me3 in B. rapa and A. thaliana. Of 10,456 genes, which had H3K27me3 in the 14-day leaf samples in both B. rapa lines (Fig. 2A), 9,769 (93.4%) had sequence homology to putatively orthologous genes in A. thaliana. This was reduced to 6,207 genes in A. thaliana following the removal of genes where two or three B. rapa genes showed sequence similarity to one A. thaliana gene. In A. thaliana, 5,333 genes identified as having H3K27me3 marks in 12-day seedlings in the C24 accession (At-data 1),46 and 5,118 genes (At-data 2), which were selected by Berke and Snel.47 About 80% of genes overlapped between the two data sets (At-data 1 and At-data 2). Between orthologous genes of B. rapa and A. thaliana, 2,409 of 6,207 genes (38.8%) had H3K27me3 in both B. rapa and the two data sets of A. thaliana, these were termed species-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes. A total of 3,097 of 6,207 genes (49.9%) had H3K27me3 in only B. rapa, these were termed Br-specific H3K27me3-marked genes (Fig. 5C).Genes categorized into ‘Transcription factor activity’ and ‘Regulation of metabolic process’ tended to be overrepresented in species-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes compared with Br-specific H3K27me3-marked genes (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Table S12). In contrast, genes categorized into ‘Plasma membrane’, ‘Transporter activity’, ‘Kinase activity’, ‘Response to stress’, and ‘Response to abiotic stimulus’ tended to be overrepresented in Br-specific H3K27me3-marked genes compared with species-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Table S12).Both species-conserved and Br-specific H3K27me3-marked genes showed high tissue specificity (Fig. 4). Genes having H3K27me3 tended to have a lower SNP number per length in each gene (mutation rates) than total genes as did species-conserved H3K27me3-marked genes relative to Br-specific H3K27me3-marked genes in T23 but not in T24 (Supplementary Fig. S11).3.6. Higher H3K27me3 levels in 14-day leaves are associated with decreased post-embryonic gene expressionH3K27me3 plays an important role in tissue-specific gene expression. We identified genes showing different H3K27me3 states just after germination (2-day cotyledons) and more than 10 days after germination (14-day leaves) in B. rapa (Supplementary Table S9). We compared the H3K27me3 levels between germinating seeds and 12-day seedlings (At-data 1) in C24 accession of A. thaliana (Supplementary Table S13).46,48Four genes showed higher H3K27me3 levels in 2-day cotyledons than in 14-day leaves in both B. rapa lines and in A. thaliana, in germinating seeds than in 12-day seedlings (Supplementary Table S13). Sixty-four genes showed higher H3K27me3 levels in 14-day leaves than in 2-day cotyledons in both B. rapa lines and in A. thaliana, in 12-day seedlings than in germinating seeds (Supplementary Table S13), and these genes tended to be categorized into ‘Seed maturation’, ‘Seed dormancy’, ‘Seed development’, and ‘Post-embryonic development’ (Supplementary Table S14). Genes categorized into ‘Post-embryonic development’ tended to have lower expression levels in 14-day leaves than in 2-day cotyledons in B. rapa (Supplementary Table S15), suggesting H3K27me3 is involved in silencing of embryogenic expression in 14-day leaves relative to their activity levels in 2-day cotyledons.3.7. Change of H3K27me3 state after vernalization treatment in B. rapaVernalization involves regulation of gene expression of FLC by H3K27me3.21,22,24 We confirmed H3K27me3 accumulation at the FLC locus by a comparison of the whole genome level of H3K27me3 states between non-vernalized (NV) and upon return to 22 °C after vernalization (V) in the C24 accession of A. thaliana. In the genome, only FLC showed an increased H3K27me3 level following return to 22 °C after vernalization in A. thaliana (Supplementary Table S16).We examined H3K27me3 states in non-vernalized (2d-C, 14d-L), vernalized (BrV1), and following return to 22 °C after vernalization (BrV2) in T24 (B. rapa). Between non-vernalized and vernalized samples at similar developmental stages, H3K27me3 levels at the whole genome level had correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.99 (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Some genes showed increased H3K27me3 levels following vernalization including the four BrFLC paralogs (Supplementary Tables S16 and S17). Following 4 weeks vernalization (BrV1) H3K27me3 increased at the first exon and part of the first intron (nucleation site) in all four FLC paralogs (Fig. 6). Following a return to 22 °C after vernalization (BrV2), an increase of H3K27me3 was observed in all four FLC paralogs, which started at the nucleation site and spread 5' to 3' along the genes (Fig. 6). Expression levels of the total amount of the four FLC paralogs were downregulated in BrV1 and BrV2 compared with the unvernalized 2d-C and 14d-L, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S12). Vernalization insensitive 3 (VIN3) and SOC1 were highly induced in BrV1 and BrV2, respectively, and the expression level of FT was upregulated in BrV1 and BrV2 (Supplementary Fig. S12). Visualization of H3K27me3 peaks by Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). 2d-C and 14d-L are non-vernalized samples and BrV1 and BrV2 are vernalized samples. 2d-C, 2-day cotyledons; 14d-L, 14-day leaves; BrV1, seeds were treated for 4 weeks at 4 °C (vernalization); BrV2, seeds were treated for 4 weeks at 4 °C and plants were transferred to the normal growth conditions for 12 days after vernalization.Visualization of H3K27me3 peaks by Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). 2d-C and 14d-L are non-vernalized samples and BrV1 and BrV2 are vernalized samples. 2d-C, 2-day cotyledons; 14d-L, 14-day leaves; BrV1, seeds were treated for 4 weeks at 4 °C (vernalization); BrV2, seeds were treated for 4 weeks at 4 °C and plants were transferred to the normal growth conditions for 12 days after vernalization.Three of five MAF-like genes (Bra031888, Bra024350, and Bra024351) showed a spread from 5' to 3' of H3K27me3 similar to that seen in the FLC genes following the return to normal conditions after 4 weeks of cold treatment (Fig. 6). Expression levels of these three MAF-like genes were downregulated following vernalization (Supplementary Fig. S12). Increased H3K27me3 levels of Bra006050 and Bra009056 in the sample upon return to 22 °C might be due to the spread of H3K27me3 from the nearby genes, Bra006051 (BrFLC3) and Bra009055 (BrFLC1) (Supplementary Fig. S13); other genes neighbouring FLC or MAF genes did not have increased H3K27me3 levels (Supplementary Fig. S14). From the comparison of ChIP-seq data, two genes (Bra032761/CYTOKININ-INDEPENDENT 1 and Bra037899/protein kinase family protein) showed decreased H3K27me3 levels following a return to 22 °C after vernalization in both B. rapa and A. thaliana (Supplementary Table S16).4. DiscussionThe location of H3K27me3 sites was conserved between the two B. rapa lines. The sites of H3K27me3 modification are less conserved between tissues than between lines, especially in genic regions. Genes with H3K27me3 marks have tissue-specific expression, suggesting a role for H3K27me3 in regulation of gene expression during development.The H3K27me3-marked genes in 14-day leaves showed lower expression levels on average than total gene expression levels, but the H3K27me3-marked genes in 2-day cotyledons showed higher expression levels than the average level of gene expression. This was especially the case in 2-day cotyledon-specific H3K27me3-marked genes. Genes that are H3K27me3-marked in both 2-day cotyledons and 14-day leaves had lower expression levels on average than the total genes in both tissues. The level of H3K27me3 in 2-day cotyledon-specific H3K27me3-marked genes was lower around the 3' region, while H3K27me3 stably marked genes showed a higher enrichment of H3K27me3 throughout the gene body region, suggesting that the low level of H3K27me3 present in 2-day cotyledon-specific H3K27me3-marked genes is not sufficient to repress gene expression. In general, there is an association between H3K27me3 marks on a gene and lower expression. In the 2-day cotyledons, this relationship did not hold. This finding is probably because of the early developmental time used; none of the analyses in other species used such early material.Genes that showed higher levels of H3K27me3 in 14-day leaves compared with 2-day cotyledons showed an overrepresentation in the category of ‘Post-embryonic development’. These genes had lower expression levels in 14-day leaves than in 2-day cotyledons, suggesting a role in reducing the expression of genes concerned with embryo development at this time. In maize and A. thaliana, 34% of orthologues were marked.10 In maize and rice, 70% of orthologs are similarly marked.10 The data suggest that genes having important functions such as regulation of transcription factor gene expression or metabolic process also have conservation of H3K27me3 marks.Approximately 30% of the pairs of paralogous genes in B. rapa had H3K27me3 in more than one copy. A similar situation holds with most pairs of syntenic genes in maize and A. thaliana.10,49 The tissue specificity of gene expression was higher in paralogous pairs marked with H3K27me3 than in those without H3K27me3 marks and expression levels were lower in the marked genes. These findings suggest that the different distribution of H3K27me3 between paralogous genes may be involved in their sub-functionalization.Environmentally related changes at the FLC locus involve H3K27me3 marks. In A. thaliana, H3K27me3 has functional roles associated with the activity level of FLC.21,22,24 Plants treated for 4 weeks at 4 °C (vernalization) gain H3K27me3 at a site downstream of the transcription start site (the nucleation region), and gene expression ceases. Following return of the plants to 22 °C, H3K27me3 spreads across the entire FLC locus stabilizing the lack of expression, allowing expression of the floral promoters, FT and SOC1, and permitting flowering to occur.50 In B. rapa, FLC has a similar role in vernalization.24,51 Three BrFLC paralogs (BrFLC1, BrFLC2, and BrFLC3), which might have been generated by whole genome triplication (Supplementary Fig. S15), and BrFLC5 had active transcription before vernalization. Their expression decreased after vernalization; the repressed state was maintained upon return to 22 °C after vernalization. Prior to the low temperature treatment in B. rapa all four FLC paralogs had only background levels of H3K27me3. At the end of 4 weeks low temperature treatment, H3K27me3 was localized at the proximal nucleation region. H3K27me3 spreads across all of the four FLC paralogs upon return to 22 °C after vernalization. In both B. rapa and A. thaliana, there is little change to genome-wide H3K27me3 levels following a return of the plants to 22 °C. There are five MAF-like genes in B. rapa and it is not clear whether these paralogs were generated by whole genome triplication (Supplementary Fig. S15). Spreading of H3K27me3 was also observed in some of the MAF-like genes.In A. thaliana, a non-coding RNA COLDAIR molecule derived from the first intron of FLC is reported to play a role in the recruitment of PRC2 to FLC.52 There is no sequence showing similarity to COLDAIR in any of the first introns of the four FLC paralogs in B. rapa.51,53 In agreement with Li et al.,32 we did not find any transcript from the first intron of any of the four FLC paralogs in B. rapa in vernalized leaves.54 COLDAIR and any other non-coding RNAs may not be expressed from the first intron of FLC paralogs in B. rapa.54 A stabilization of repression by the spreading of H3K27me3 marks on return to normal growth condition has been attributed to COLDAIR RNA control but the absence of COLDAIR transcripts in B. rapa suggests a reconsideration of this view is needed.We thank Andrew Spriggs and Jenifer M.

IntroductionThe advent of high-throughput sequencing has accelerated large-scale data production, exemplified by the 1,000 human genomes project,1 the 1,001 Arabidopsis genomes project,2 the maize HapMap project3 and the recently completed 3,000 rice genomes project.4,5. Therefore, there is an urgent need to meet the demand for efficient visualization of genome-wide resequencing data and analytical results of such sequences. In particular, the results obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) utilizing large-scale genome-wide polymorphism data and phenotypic traits have increased drastically in number and have contributed to understanding various biological phenomena. GWASs are recognized as a powerful method for identifying genes or genomic regions responsible for a trait of interest and are used widely in medical science to study the causative loci of cancer, diabetes, drug susceptibility, etc.6 GWAS is also utilized in other fields, including agronomy, allowing the causal genes of yield, disease tolerance, abiotic stress response and many other traits to be isolated.7–12Since GWASs generally require a considerable number of genome-wide polymorphic sites obtained from more than one hundred samples, manual validation of the resultant data is quite laborious. Generally, the results from a GWAS are presented by a Manhattan plot, which is a static plot of association P-values against physical genomic positions. While this visualization method is simple and easy, it is not convenient for precisely exploring causal regions of phenotypic variation. Interpretation of GWAS results, such as summary statistics of P-values in combination with phenotypic data of individuals, variant frequencies, effects of variants, annotations of genes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, is necessary. To date, several computer programs that aim to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and visualize GWAS results with gene annotation information and that are equipped with functions to investigate SNPs in an interactive, manipulatable manner have been developed.13–17 Since these programs depend heavily on information generated by an external variant caller, it is quite possible that large insertions and deletions (indels) and copy number variations (CNVs) that are frequently undetected by such callers are overlooked, although these variants are rather important candidate causal variants for phenotypes of interest.18 Therefore, a genome-scale viewer that displays large gaps beyond the extent of variant callers would be of great use.Another issue is large-scale genomic data sharing with the public. Some valuable projects provide data sets of published GWASs as a catalogue of summary statistics, variant information and annotation information obtained from multiple sources for major model species such as humans,19 Arabidopsis20 and Asian rice.21 However, these platforms are specific to certain genomes, and published GWAS data for other species are not easily accessible and reusable. Thus, a platform for quick visualization and sharing of GWAS data that can be utilized easily for any genomic study is needed.Here, we present TASUKE+, which simultaneously displays GWAS results and polymorphisms in hundreds of genomes in one window such that researchers can easily explore causal variants with phenotypic information, various types of annotation and phenotypic effects of genes. TASUKE+ shows either precise SNP/indel data with read depth information at the nucleotide level or a genomic overview of several megabases in one window. Therefore, users are able to perceive large structural variants missed by variant caller programs with depth information. TASUKE was originally developed as a program for visualizing and sharing data via the web so that users could share their own resequencing data with collaborators, the public or both immediately after publication of the paper through user-friendly interfaces.22 TASUKE has been adopted as a platform to display the genome resequencing data of several projects.23–25 Since the first release of TASUKE, a considerable number of improvements have been made (Supplementary Table S1). The current version of TASUKE+ is equipped with some new major functions, such as GWAS result visualization, data export, external links to other databases, molecular phylogenetic analysis and PCR primer design. In particular, the latter should be useful for experiments including replication analysis in GWASs. To illustrate a practical application of TASUKE+, a GWAS of 7 agronomical traits in 176 rice varieties26 are presented.2. Materials and methods2.1. Platform and data to be importedA schematic view of the TASUKE+ system is shown in Fig. 1. The input files for TASUKE+ are those in commonly used formats, such as a FASTA file of the reference genome used for resequencing data mapping and variant calling, variant call format (VCF) files for each sample created by SAMtools27 or GATK28 and BAM files (optional) containing alignments of the reads. Annotation files in general feature format (GFF) and files related to GWASs, including results files in the qqman format29 (chromosome name, chromosome position and P-value) and phenotypic information for each sample, are also optional. TASUKE’s user interface was developed as a web application of HTML5. The web storage feature and the canvas element of HTML5 are used for rapidly displaying massive information from a large genomic region. A MySQL database is used for backend data management on a Linux server on which Apache and PHP can be run. One of the useful functions of data management is that a part of the database can be shared by a specific group. When users have two or more projects involving resequencing or a GWAS, they can put their data into a single MySQL database for TASUKE+, select a small part of the data and release this part independently of the rest of the data. Moreover, if users obtain new data, the data can be added to the existing database with the same procedure as that of brand-new system installation. The data to be displayed can be selected from both old and new data sets in a flexible manner by writing a configuration file. In addition, multiple TASUKE+ browsers depicting different data sets can be easily launched from a single backend database. Schematic view of the TASUKE+ system. Data from genome resequencing (fasta, VCF and BAM files) and a GWAS (qqman format and phenotype data files) are added to a MySQL database with annotation information (GFF) on a backend Linux server running Apache and PHP programs. The server environments and default values for parameters of visualization can be specified in a configuration file (Conf). Genomic views and analytical functions are provided through general web browsers.

For details, see https://tasuke.dna.affrc.go.jp/installation.html.2.2. Reanalysis of rice GWAS dataThe data obtained from the rice GWAS employing 176 temperate japonica varieties included single nucleotide variants and phenotypic data for 7 traits.26 The traits heading date, panicle length, awn length, plant height, panicle number per plant, leaf blade width and spikelet number per panicle were obtained from the same paper. We retrieved the resequencing data from the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) Sequence Read Archive.30 The low-quality bases and adapter sequences in each read were removed by using Trimmomatic 0.36.31 The reads were mapped to the IRGSP-1.0 Nipponbare reference genome32 by BWA-mem (v0.7.15) with the default setting,33 and local realignment was conducted by using GATK 3.7.28 After removing PCR duplicates with Picard 2.9.0 (http://picard.sourceforge.net), the variants were called for each sample by using the GATK HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs with the default setting. As a result, 822,655 SNPs were detected. The effect of each variant site was annotated by SnpEff.34 Rice genome annotation information from the RAP database (RAP-DB)23 and MSU release 732 was used for the SnpEff analysis, and this information was included in the annotation track of TASUKE+. For the GWAS, VCF files were converted to a PLINK format file by using PLINK v1.9.35 After removing sites with a minor allele frequency of <0.05, 406,224 SNPs were retained, and data imputation was conducted using Beagle version 3.3.2.36 Then, a GWAS was performed with the linear mixed model implemented in the Fast-LMM program.37 The resultant GWAS data set in the qqman format (chromosome name, chromosome position and P-value) and phenotypic data were added to the TASUKE+ database with the corresponding variant and mapping data. LD blocks were inferred for the aforementioned SNPs data set by using PLINK v1.9 with the following options: –blocks no-pheno-req no-small-max-span –no-pheno –no-parents –no-sex –nonfounders –no-fid –ld-window-kb 1,000. This data set is available at https://tasuke-plus.dna.affrc.go.jp/.3. Results and discussion3.1. Functions and application overviewTASUKE was designed to visualize large-scale genome resequencing data for hundreds of genomes.22 The new version, TASUKE+, shows both GWAS data and SNPs and indels called on a reference genome. The occurrence frequency of SNPs and indels at each genomic position as well as depth information are drawn on a scalable block with a nucleotide length of 1 bp to 100 kb with various information tracks for GWAS results, gene annotation and so on. For accessibility and easy sharing of extremely large data sets, TASUKE+ was developed as a web application implemented in HTML5. Researchers can share the data within a specific group or with the public via general web browsers so that end users, including non-bioinformaticians, can easily browse extremely large genome resequencing data sets without extensive bioinformatics knowledge. It is also possible to connect with other databases through the function of external link. TASUKE+ provides not only the visual data stored in the database but also data-analysis functions useful for users who would like to export nucleotide sequences, conduct a sequence homology search by BLAST, build a phylogenetic tree, design primers and so on. Detailed information of improvements and new functions that have been added since the first release of TASUKE22 is described in Supplementary Table S1. All these functions are implemented in a user-friendly web-based interface so that users’ operations will be made simpler (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The main window of TASUKE+ showing GWAS and variant information for resequencing data obtained from 176 rice varieties. (A) Positions on the reference genome and annotation information are shown in the uppermost pane. (B) Annotation information tracks show features provided by a GFF format file (e.g. gene structures and LD blocks). By clicking on a gene, a pop-up window containing detailed information appears.

(F) Variants can also be shown by their precise genomic positions with nucleotides coloured orange for A, pink for T, green for G and blue for C.The reference genome and its annotation information are displayed at the top of the main panel (Fig. 2A). Users can select chromosomes and jump to a specific genomic position by clicking on a diagram of the chromosome or typing a position in a search window, which can also be used to search for identifiers such as gene name, gene ID, LD block and marker name described in the annotation of GFF files and displayed in annotation tracks (Fig. 2B). The summary statistics of GWASs are shown in the upper pane as a Manhattan plot illustrating the significance value (-log10(P)) of association for each polymorphic site and phenotypic value (Fig. 2C). The main panel shows nucleotide variations (SNPs and indels) for each resequenced sample by their name or identifier with user-supplied information such as sample group (population), origin, publication name and phenotypic value, and the information can be represented by different colours. SNPs and indels are displayed by occurrence frequency per block with the read depth shown in the background, and users can choose to show/hide each set of information. Optionally, nucleotide variations can be shown one by one at their precise genomic position by turning off the default ‘Block mode’. Furthermore, the phenotypic effect level of a variant inferred by SnpEff34 can be displayed (Fig. 2D–F). The variants and average read depth are shown with blocks scalable from 1 bp to 100 kb in length. Up to 200 blocks are displayed in a window; hence, a region of at most 20 Mb can be viewed at a glance. This block-style summarization of variants by occurrence frequency is quite efficient when users wish to compare genomes in a megabase-scale view. If the user zooms in on a selected region, the nucleotide sequence of a reference genome and its translated amino acid sequences can be shown at a 1-bp resolution. The mapped-read depth information is shown behind the nucleotide variation data in grayscale, and yellow is used to indicate the unmapped region (depth = 0). This depth information is important for distinguishing between no-variant regions and no-mapped-read regions. The regions with no mapped reads occur because of either low sequencing coverage or large deletions, which are often indistinguishable by ordinary variant callers designed for short-read data and hence generally omitted in VCF files. TASUKE+ can show large-scale structural variants described in input VCF files. A pop-up window describing read depth and detailed variant information (variant type, allele of the reference genome, alternative allele, genotype, quality provided by the variant caller and effect of variants) is shown by clicking on a block (Fig. 2D). The effects of variants such as nonsense mutations, frame shifts and nonsynonymous mutations, which can be added to VCF files by using SnpEff software,34 are displayed with different colour levels signifying MODIFIER, LOW, MODERATE and HIGH by selecting SnpEff mode from a pull-down menu (Fig. 2E). This information is of special importance when searching for candidates of causal mutations affecting phenotypes.Furthermore, TASUKE+ has some functions for easily realizing bidirectional links from/to external databases, so that researchers can easily receive information from external databases (Supplementary Fig. S2). For example, a link to other websites can be created in a subwindow of annotation information that pops up upon clicking on a gene structure in an annotation track. This link can be defined for each annotation feature with prefix and suffix information described in a configure file. In addition, a specific genomic position or an identifier in an annotation track of the data in TASUKE+ can be written in the following format: https://tasuke-plus.dna.affrc.go.jp/? chr=chr07&st=5000001&en=6000000. In this way, any external databases can be linked to a specific region of TASUKE+ only by specifying a genomic position or a gene identifier. We expect TASUKE+ to be useful not only as an independent database but also as a database of other omics databases or as a part of an omics data network.3.2. Visualization of GWAS resultsTASUKE+ was developed to serve as a platform with which to simultaneously visualize GWAS results, sequence variations and annotations and to publish them in an effective manner via a web browser. Given GWAS data sets for multiple phenotypes in the input file format used in the qqman R package,29 TASUKE+ displays a Manhattan plot below the genome annotation area so that users can compare annotated gene information with probable candidate regions detected by a GWAS (Fig. 3). The main window of TASUKE+ shows genetic polymorphisms such as SNPs and indels in at most 20-Mb regions, together with possible phenotypic effects inferred by SnpEff so that variant effects such as frame shifts, non-sense mutations and splice site mutations are visible. The phenotypic values used for GWAS are displayed in the accession information pane, and the order of accessions is sortable by this information. This feature is helpful for interpreting GWAS results because one can observe patterns of genome-wide distributions of association signals, zoom in to local regions, and search for candidates of causal genes and variants by examining phenotypic effect levels as well as various types of annotation information. There are some web-based services for calculation of GWAS38–41 and, in particular, easyGWAS40 also has a function to display GWAS results. In this study, we aimed to provide a flexible visualization program that can show GWAS results in parallel with various mutation data on raw sequence data and their precise annotations. In addition, TASUKE+ can be installed on users’ own server and be modified by changing a configuration file to meet demands of a broad range of users. To assist the installation of TASUKE+, detailed information is available at https://tasuke.dna.affrc.go.jp/installation.html. Exploration of GWAS data.

(E) Download list of genotypes and annotation information for a user-selected region.To showcase the functionality of TASUKE+, we applied it to the reanalysis of GWAS data generated by Yano et al.,26 who conducted a GWAS for seven agronomic traits, including heading date, plant height, awn length and panicle number, with 176 temperate japonica rice varieties. We reanalysed the whole data set of raw reads and conducted a GWAS using a linear mixed model with 406,224 SNPs. The TASUKE+ database for these data was constructed with GWAS summary statistics of the seven traits, the variant and read depth, and the data were displayed on the rice reference genome IRGSP-1.0 with variant effect information and gene annotation from the Rice Annotation Project (RAP) and Rice Genome Annotation project of Michigan State University (MSU). This dataset is available at https://tasuke-plus.dna.affrc.go.jp/.Figure 3 shows an example to explore GWAS data for heading date through TASUKE+ (for details of the GWAS data generation, see Supplementary Fig. S3). The Manhattan plots for all chromosomes and a table of polymorphic sites with GWAS summary statistics of P-values and variant effects for genes are shown interactively in a subwindow (Fig. 3A). Variant sites in the table can be filtered by effect level so that users can see a list of only variants having high impacts on gene functions. If one clicks on a specific SNP showing a strong association in the Manhattan plot or in the list of significant associations in the GWAS subwindow, the position of the SNP is immediately shown in the main window (Fig. 3B). After jumping to the candidate region of interest, users can examine nearby variants and check proximate genes and inferred LD blocks in annotation tracks by smoothly scaling and moving over genomics regions. Variants are coloured on the basis of the predicted functional effect levels so that candidates for functional polymorphisms associated with the phenotype of interest can be recognized. Users can also design appropriate primers for a specific region (Fig. 3C). Browsing the GWAS result and nucleotide variations with their functional effect levels enables users to quickly pick up candidate genes. Os01g0846450/LOC_Os01g62780, which was reported to be a new causal gene for heading date in Yano et al.,26 showed a strong association in our reanalysed result as shown in Fig. 3D. By clicking on the gene structure, a subwindow for the position, links to external database, phylogenetic analysis and data exports is displayed. A list of genotype information of a specified region or gene for all samples can be exported as a text file (Fig. 3E). In this way, exploring GWAS results in parallel with variant information and any kind of annotation information provided by GFF files will be of great use for researchers conducting a GWAS to identify candidate mutations, as recently noted in a rice GWAS report.26 Integration of these functionalities in TASUKE+ will provide researchers with an efficient computational environment to interpret GWAS results without referring to multiple data in separate programs and databases.Once researchers find some polymorphisms of interest, PCR primers can be quickly designed in TASUKE+ by using Primer3.42 Users can select any region as a target to be amplified and design appropriate primers with various options. To take variant information into account, users can choose the ‘Variant masking’ option, which masks variable sites in the query sequence to avoid designing primers based on polymorphic sites. The uniqueness of the primers designed for the genome sequence can be checked by the BLAST function. An in silico PCR (also known as ePCR) function using MFEprimer43 to evaluate the PCR products amplified by the designed primer pairs is provided. In this way, PCR primers for SNPs and indels that can be used as DNA markers are easily designed in TASUKE+.3.3. Phylogenetic tree reconstructionMolecular phylogenetic tree construction was added as a novel function (Fig. 4). If users wish to investigate the relationships among genomes of interest, they can select the desired number of genomes stored in TASUKE+ and generate a phylogenetic tree. Users can restrict the regions to be used for the analysis by specifying a genomic position or gene identifier. The genetic distances are calculated by Kimura’s 2-parameter model44 implemented in DNADIST,45 and the phylogeny is reconstructed by using the neighbour-joining method46 implemented in NEIGHBOR of the PHYLIP package.45 We used treelib-js (https://github.com/rdmpage/treelib-js/) to draw the tree. The reconstructed phylogenetic tree can be previewed on TASUKE+ in three styles: rectangular, circular and linear (Fig. 4A), and the Newick tree format file, image file and fasta format alignment file of the corresponding region are downloadable so that users can visualize the tree with other viewer programs and conduct further molecular evolutionary analyses with their alignment data. Once a phylogeny is reconstructed in TASUKE+, the phylogenetic relationships of genomes can be reflected in the main variant pane by sorting accessions by order in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4B). These functions will help users understand how the samples are related at a glance. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction. (A) Trees of three styles are illustrated by treelib-js.

ConclusionTo meet demands in the era of high-throughput sequencing and phenotyping, TASUKE+ has several useful functions such as visualization of GWAS results, phylogenetic tree reconstruction and PCR primer design. TASUKE+ enables users to efficiently integrate GWAS results with variant information including SNPs and indels as well as various annotations, such as genes, repeats and LD blocks. It is also possible to provide links to/from external databases so that users can smoothly move between databases. To showcase the usefulness of TASUKE+, we presented reanalysed GWAS data of 176 rice cultivars and seven traits. TASUKE+ will enhance processing of large-scale sequencing and phenotyping data and will also contribute to omics database networking.Data availabilityTASUKE+ is freely available at https://tasuke.dna.affrc.go.jp/.The authors thank H.

IntroductionBlack rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii Hilgendorf) is an economically important viviparous marine teleost species of the Sebastidae family which inhabits the seas of Japan, Korea, and China.1 However, in northern China, high rates of abortion during the gestation period cause substantial economic losses. Black rockfish copulates from November through December via specialized urogenital papilla. During the post-copulatory period, sperm is stored within the female ovary, in which survivability and viability are maintained for up to 6 months.2 The species is characterized by internal fertilization, which in China occurs during the period from April to May of the following year. Fertilization and embryo hatching occur internally within the female ovary.3,4 Thus, black rockfish is considered an attractive viviparous fish model for studies on reproductive specialization (Fig. 1), particularly, studies focusing on the mechanisms underlying reproductive strategy, sperm storage, sperm competition, and sexual selection, and studies attempting to overcome the problems associated with abortion during the gestational stage. Unfortunately, to date, information regarding the genetic basis of vivipary in marine teleosts is scarce at best.

(a) Photograph of black rockfish, (b) the sperm ultrastructure, (c) sperm in the female ovary, (d) embryo in the female ovary before hatching, and (e) larva fish in the female ovary after hatching. Sperm storage is a widely common reproductive strategy among those vertebrate species, characterized by internal fertilization.5 However, the mechanism of long-term sperm storage tends to be species-specific due to differences in storage organs. Numerous studies on mammals,6 birds,7 and insects8 have focused on issues associated with long-term sperm storage in females.9,10 Such studies have indicated that energy metabolism play a key role in sperm survivability and in maintaining sperm viability. Accordingly, it has been speculated that carbohydrates produced in female sperm storage organs could serve as metabolic substrates required for long-term sperm storage.In the present study, we describe the first chromosome-level S. schlegelii genome characterization based on sequence analysis performed by combining the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel sequencing platform and 10× Genomic and Hi-C mapping technologies to improve genome assembly. This genome description will provide valuable resources for researchers in the field to elucidate the mechanisms underlying key aspects of the reproductive biology of S. schlegelii; in addition, it will contribute to culturing the larvae of this species. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report genome information for a viviparous marine teleost. Moreover, here we provide new insights into the long-term storage of sperm in the female ovary through transcriptome and sperm physiological analyses.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collectionMale black rockfish (S. schlegelii) was collected from Penglai, China, and used to generate the genome sequence data. Fresh muscle samples were obtained from the black rockfish specimens under sterile conditions. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until used for genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was obtained using standard SDS phenol/chloroform extraction and purification protocols. The quality of the genomic DNA obtained was assessed. Two-year-old male black rockfish (S. schlegelii) was anesthetized with MS222 (100 µg/ml), injected into the bottom of the pectoral fin colchicine (2.5 µg/g). Head-kidney was collected 4 h later to prepare the chromosomes.2.2. DNA sequencingFor PacBio sequel sequencing, MagBeads bound with DNA-Polymerase complexes were loaded at 0.1 nM (on-plate concentration) using 14 single-molecule real-time (SMRT) Cells. Single-molecule sequences with C4 chemistry were constructed with PacBio sequel platform. Thereafter, a single 10× Genomics Linked-Read library from the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform was constructed, and then, a Hi-C library was prepared with formaldehyde fixation, enzyme restriction, and biotinylated labelling. Finally, 350-bp paired-end libraries from the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform were constructed.2.3. Genome size estimationBlack rockfish genome-size was estimated using the k-mer method11 (Supplementary Fig. S1).2.4. Genome assemblyFALCON assembler12 was used to assemble third-generation long reads to contigs of the S. schlegelii genome. The FALCON assembly process was as follows. (i) DALIGNER was used to perform error correction,13 according to the probability of insertion, deletion, and sequence errors. After error correction, we obtained pre-assemble reads. (ii) LASort and LAMerge were used for overlap-detection using the pre-assemble reads. To generate a layout of overlapping reads, we obtained de novo assembled reference contigs. (iii) The single-pass long reads were re-sequenced, mapped to de novo assembled reference contigs, and obtained for base-quality-aware consensus of uniquely mapped reads. In addition to FALCON, wtdbg2 was also used to assemble third-generation long reads by blast (KBM), assemble (FBG), and error correction (daccord).Quiver14 was used to refine the genome. Initially, PacBio contigs were scaffolded, and then fragScaff was used to obtain super-scaffolds using 10× Genomics Linked-Read data.15To enhance a chromosomal-level assembly, we used the Hi-C sequence library with Lachesis software.16,17 Initially, we compared the sequence with the draft version. BWA was used to map Hi-C clean reads to the polished S. schlegelii genome. Thereafter, cluster, order, and orientations were determined. Contigs were clustered into chromosome groups, according to the interaction of paired reads between two contigs. If the number of paired reads was much larger and the contigs interaction greater, they were clustered into one group according to the number of interactions reads which interacted with each other between two contigs, clustered, and classified into groups based on the number of the S. schlegelii chromosome, and then they were ordered within groups and assigned contig orientations in line with the strength and location of the interaction between the reads. Juicebox was used to correct the contig orientation; finally, chromosomes were anchored. Chromosomal-level assembly of the black rockfish genome was based on restriction sites in sequences and the link relationship from Hi-C; then we constructed a map, computed the weight, and connected the contigs (scaffolds) for each chromosome.Illumina short reads were initially mapped to the chromosomal-level genome assembly version using the BWA software. Subsequently, we applied Pilon18 to correct the remaining base errors with short reads according to the map results.2.5. Genome quality evaluationThe accuracy of the assembled S. schlegelii genome was evaluated by mapping short sequence reads to the S. schlegelii genome using the BWA program,19 and we performed variant calling based on SAMtools. CEGMA20 with the core genes from vrt dataset and BUSCO21 analyses for completeness of evaluation of the S. schlegelii genome assembly. The genome assemblies by falcon and wtdbg2 were compared to obtain a more reliable genome assembly. Furthermore, we compared characteristics of the S. schlegelii genome with those of other teleost species.In addition, after completing the genome assembly, we confirmed the quality by FISH probes obtained from an identical chromosome assembled that could be anchored on the same chromosome. Two genes of interested, 3.816 and 3.70, from chr3 were used. Firstly, we created the local blast database of the S. schlegelii genome. Secondly, we extracted their gene sequence of them. Thirdly, we blasted each of them to the local database and selected the chr3-specific section for further design. Fourthly, PCR amplification, gel electrophoresis detection and PCR product purification sequencing were performed. Primers that were PCR single banded, size and sequence corrected were used for further probes preparation. The probes were synthetized by PCR. 3.816 was labelled with digoxin, and 3.70 was labelled with fluorescein. The PCR system was according to a modified ExTaq multiplex system (TAKARA) with 1 µg high purity DNA template. The probes were purified using sin sequencing reaction clean-up kit (Sigma). The detection was conducted by anti-dig and anti-fluorescein POD antibodies. Signal amplification was conducted with the TSA plus fluorescein/TMR kit (PerkinElmer). Mounting was performed with prolonged gold anti-fade (molecular probes by Life Technologies). Images were obtained by a microscope (Niko Eclipse Ni).2.6. AnnotationTandem Repeat Finder22 was used to detect repetitive elements in the S. schlegelii genome. RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html) was used to de novo identify genomic transposable elements (TE) and Repbase23 was used for the known repeats library. The de novo and known libraries were then combined. RepeatMasker23–25 was used to identify the TEs in the S. schlegelii genome.The structural and functional annotations of the assembled genome were conducted using de novo, homolog-based, and RNA-seq methods. Augustus,26 GeneID,27 GeneScan,28 GlimmerHMM,29 and SNAP30 were used for de novo genome prediction. Thereafter, protein sequences from Cynoglossus semilaevis, Paralichthys olivaceus, Takifugu rubripes, Oreochromis niloticus, Monopterus albus, Hippocampus comes, Oryzias latipes, Xiphophorus maculatus, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and Danio rerio were searched against the S. schlegelii genome using TBLASTN.31 RNA-seq data assembled using Trinity32 were aligned against the S. schlegelii genome. Putative exon regions and splice junctions were identified by mapping RNA-seq data to the genome with Tophat,33 then, mapped reads were assembled into gene models using Cufflinks.34 All the gene models were integrated using Evidence Modeler (EVM).35 We compared the genomic structural characters of the S. schlegelii genome with those of the genomes of closely related species. Gene functions were annotated using BLAST with the SwissProt,36 Nr, Pfam,37 GO,38 and KEGG,39 and InterPro databases. We predicted the gene structure first, and blast the gene functional clusters against known databases by comparison software, then we obtained the function information for the genes. First, we blast S. schlegelii and other homologous species with blastall, with parameters set as follows: -p: tblastn (procedure), -e 1e-05 (expectation value), -F: T (low complexity regions, LCR filter). In a second step, we combined the hits of blast results with Solar software set as follows: -a prot2genome2 (-cCn 100000-d -1), -c cluster and constructed multi-blocks, -C do not examine the overlap in query, -n INUM maximum gap length 100000, -d -1 minimum depth for repeats (-1 stands for no masking). Finally, we predicted the full gene structure based on the blast hits with GeneWise with the following commands: -trev Compare on the reverse strand, -tfor Compare on the forward strand, -gensef show gene structure with supporting evidence, -gff Gene Feature Format file, -sum show summary output.Non-coding RNA in the S. schlegelii genome was predicted by BLAST against the human rRNA database, tRNAscan-SE,40 INFERNAL,41 and the Rfam database.372.7. Phylogenetic analysis and estimation of divergence timeThe OrthoMCL42 method was used to cluster into gene families. Maximum likelihood (ML) was used for phylogenetic analysis. PAML43 was used for estimation time of divergence.2.8. Microenvironment of the female ovarySix cDNA libraries (FII, FIII–IV) were constructed using total RNA from pre-copulatory and post-copulatory female ovaries. Clean reads were assembled into non-redundant transcripts, and then, these transcripts were clustered into Unigenes. There were three biological replicates at each stage. The differential expression of genes was analysed between pre- and post-copulatory stages.2.9. Sperm analysisFresh sperm was collected into a 200-µl centrifuge tube by gently hand stripping the testis dissected from ripe males in November. Five male individuals were prepared. Three individuals showing sperm motility>80% were used in subsequent experiments. The sperm of the three individuals were mixed together to eliminate individual differences. They were divided into two groups, a control group and a treatment group. The sperm activator of male serum was added to each group. Suppression of glycolysis was attained with sodium iodoacetate at 0.125 mM. The two groups were placed at 4 °C. Sperm motility parameters and longevity were determined using an SCA Evolution CASA sperm class analyser (Barcelona, Spain).3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe size of the S. schlegelii genome was estimated at 842.97 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1), and the assembled genome size was 848.31 Mb. The initial 85.78 Gb (101.76× coverage) PacBio data (Table 1) determined N50 length to be between 15.66 and 25.20 kb. Subsequently, a 129.75-Gb (153.92× coverage) of sequencing data were obtained from the 10× Genomics Linked-Read library (Table 1). The addition resulted in an 847.88-Mb draft genome comprising 1,471 scaffolds, with N50 value being improved to between 2.92 and 4.34 Mb (Table 2). Following this step, a total of 118.90 Gb (141.05× coverage) of Hi-C data were generated to assisted the assembly at the chromosomal level. We then successfully clustered 951 contigs into 24 groups using Lachesis (Fig. 2), resulting in 641 contigs that were reliably anchored on chromosomes by Hi-C. The cluster number was at 67.40% and the base count of the total genome was 96.19%. This third refinement resulted in a draft genome size of 847.94 Mb with 854 scaffolds, and an enhanced N50 value of 35.60 Mb (Table 2). Finally, we corrected the remaining errors using Pilon (Table 2). The genome size of the finally draft was 848.31 Mb, comprising 854 scaffolds, with a Contig N50 of 2.96 Mb and a Scaffold N50 of 35.63 Mb. A schematic representation of the characteristics of the genome of S. schlegelii is shown in Figure 3. The contig contact matrix from the genome of Sebastes schlegelii derived from Hi-C data. In the plot, the red colour indicates a high-density logarithm and the white colour indicates a low contact density logarithm. In Hi-C analysis, the genome was divided into bin by 100k. The number of interactions between bin reads was calculated, that is, the number of interactions between bins.

Genome quality evaluationA total of 97.93% of the short sequence reads covered 99.61% map of the genome assembly map. We used samtools (http://dept.qdio.cas.cn/emblc/ktzjs/hyjg/zncy/) to deal with the comparison result of BWA, order the chromosome coordinate, dispose of the repeat reads, SNP calling, filter the raw data, and finally get the homozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) percentage. The homology for SNP was 0.00038%. As the percentage of homology for SNP reflects the accuracy of genome assembly, and 0.00038% indicates that the level of genome assembly shows high quality at the single-base level. Moreover, CEGMA and BUSCO analyses were used to evaluate the genome assembly quality, providing scores of 92.34% and 95.5%, respectively (Table 3). In the BUSCO analysis summarized in Table 3, 2.4% of the genes were missing and 2.1% of the genes were fragmented, together adding up to 4.5%. There were 127 genes missing in the BUSCO dataset. We extracted the pep ID of the missing genes, and blast with the pep sequence of S. schlegelii. The percentage of the alignments was all <50%, indicating that they were not in the genome of S. schlegelii. Therefore, the results confirmed that the missing genes from BUSCO’S aligner could not be aligned. Furthermore, the genome assembly versions of S. schlegelii were compared (Table 4). The scaffold N50 and genome coverage assembly as per the falcon version (35.63 Mb, 99.61) was higher than that of the wtdbg2 version (33.81 Mb, 99.36) while the contig N50 and the homology SNP (%) assembly as per the falcon version (2.92 Mb, 0.00038) is lower than that of the wtdbg2 version (15.39 Mb, 0.0009). Assembled S. schlegelii genome was compared with those of other teleost species (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S1). The N50 lengths of both contigs and scaffolds are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

Genome annotation of black rockfishThe RNA-seq data for the S. schlegelii genome and that of the genomes of 10 other teleost species were used for the structural and functional annotations (Supplementary Table S2). The annotated results revealed the following information: repetitive elements, 39.98%; in the genome of S. schlegelii, the main repetitive transposable elements were the DNA transposons (18.06%) and retrotransposable elements (17.93%) (Table 5). Among 26,979 protein-coding genes, 26,775 (99.20%) were functionally annotated with terms (Table 6). We compared the structure of the genome of S. schlegelii with those of closely related species. The mean number of exons per gene was 8.63 (Supplementary Table S3).

Phylogenetic and divergence-time analysisIn the present study, we constructed 24,636 gene family clusters with 648 single-copy gene families (Fig. 6). S. schlegelii diverged from the common ancestor of Gasterosteus aculeatus ~32.1–56.8 million years ago (Fig. 7). The retrotransposable elements (17.93%) were more than in zebrafish (11%), and less than in humans (44%). In contrast, the DNA transposable elements of S. schlegelii were 18.06%, more than in humans (3.2%), and medaka (<10%) but less than in zebrafish (39%). In addition, there were 1,331 specific family clusters in S. schlegelii, over four times more than that in G. aculeatus (322). We identified 422 gene families to be expanded in the S. schlegelii genome. The functional enrichment by GO and KEGG of those expanded gene families identified 282 and 45 significantly enriched (P < 0.05) GO terms and pathways, respectively. The expanded gene families were mainly found on NOD-like receptor signal pathways (P = 2.91E-23), circadian entrainment (P = 1.48E-17), taste transduction (P = 3.39E-15), calcium signal pathway (P = 6.40E-13), olfactory transduction signal pathway (P = 4.06E-09), dynein complex term (P = 5.12E-21), homophilic cell adhesion term (P = 7.27E-17), transmembrane transport term (P = 7.35e-15), and microtubule motor activity term (P = 5.25E-14). Additionally, we identified 76 gene families that were enriched significantly contracted in this work.

The interaction between ovary microenvironment and sperm storageFemale black rockfish have been found to store sperm in their ovaries for up to 6 months. The maintenance of sperm viability is dependent upon exogenous energy sources derived from the ovary microenvironment. Carrier protein SLC2 showed significantly positive selection based on comparative genome analysis. The expression of carbohydrate metabolism-related KEGG pathways was significantly up-regulated in ovaries from pre-copulation to post-copulation, based on differential genes expression analysis of transcriptome. Based on FPKM value, gene expression of carbohydrate metabolism-related genes, such as HXK2, GAA, GDE, UGP2, HXK1, PFKFB3, ALDOA, ADPGK, PFKAP, and ENOA were all significantly up-regulated from pre-copulation (FII) to post-copulation (FIII–IV), as per KEGG (Fig. 8a). Moreover, glycolysis is one of the ATP-energy producing pathways enhanced by energy-substrate availability. Sodium iodoacetate is a specific inhibitor of glycolysis acting on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In the present study, sperm longevity in the experimental group subjected to in vitro suppression of glycolysis by sodium iodoacetate was significantly reduced sperm longevity from 504 ± 24 h to 384 ± 48 h (control group) (Fig. 8b). These results indicated that carbohydrate sources from the microenvironment surrounding the ovaries may play an important role in maintaining sperm survivability during long-term storage.

DiscussionBlack rockfish is a viviparous marine teleost characterized by internal fertilization associated with long-term (up to 6 months) sperm storage in the female ovary. However, although the genomes of numerous oviparous fish species have been previously been sequenced, to date, few genomic resources have been reported for viviparous marine teleosts. Currently, data are available for the viviparous freshwater fish platyfish44 and for the chondrichthyes elephant shark.45 The S. schlegelii genome described herein expands the information available on genome evolution of viviparous marine teleost species. Moreover, the chromosomal-level genome assembly of S. schlegelii provides an opportunity to examine the appearance (reproductive strategy, sperm storage, sperm competition, and sexual selection) of viviparty at the genome level.In recent years, long-read sequences have experienced an important growth spurt with PacBio technologies. There are many assemblers for long-read assembly, and it is necessary to generate multiple genome assemblies and compare the results to obtain a more reliable genome assembly for the genome community. In the present study, the genome assembly was done using FALCON and wtdbg2. Currently, many genome assemblies obtained for teleosts by FALCON are available, such as those of Antarctic blackfin icefish,46 snailfish,47 yellow catfish,48 Cephalopods,49 barkley,50 and mountain carps.51 In addition, in other species, such as great ape,52 koala,53 water buffalo,54 maize,55 stout camphor tree,56 and apple,57 the FALCON assembler has been widely used in long-read assembly of the genome. At first, we selected FALCON as the assembler, and then, we also used wtdbg2 to reassembly and compared the two in order to assess the quality of the two assemblies. Although FALCON may not be the best assembler, it is reliable enough in long-read assembly. The overall quality of the FALCON assembly of S. schlegelii genome resides in its reliability.On the basis of comparison of the genome assembly of S. schlegelii with that available for other teleosts, the contig and scaffold N50 lengths were both of considerable continuity. In the present study, we used a combination of Pacific Biosciences sequel and Illumina sequencing platforms and 10× Genomics and Hi-C technology to obtain a genome assembly size of 848.31 Mb comprising 24 chromosomes, and contig and scaffold N50 lengths of 2.96 and 35.63 Mb, respectively. Moreover, the sequenced S. schlegelii genome was found to be considerably longer than those obtained for other fish species using next-generation sequencing technology, and even far surpassed some genome sequencing obtained using PacBio. We also compared basic genome structural features, including genes lengths, coding regions, and non-coding regions of the S. schlegelii genome with those of closely related species, all of which reached a reasonable high level. Genome annotation, revealed that the S. schlegelii genome contains 39.98% repetitive elements (Table 5), which is considerably higher than the corresponding percentage of the three-spine stickleback,58 but lower than that of the zebrafish.59Among the 19 species, we used to construct the phylogenetic tree in the present study, there are two types of reproductive strategy, namely, viviparity44,45 and oviparity.58,59 Interestingly, we found that those species characterized by viviparous and oviparous modes of reproduction did not show any particular evolutionary relationship (Fig. 6). The results showed that the reproductive mode is not significantly or no directly related to an evolutionary relationship. Vivipary is not an attribute of phyletic evolution but of specialization from closely related oviparous species. In particular, black rockfish and platy fish are both viviparous, and we found that they diverged from the three-spined stickleback fish and medaka several tens of millions of years ago, respectively. The specialization of viviparity from the closely related oviparous species may be ascribed to environmental influences. Currently, there is limited information available regarding reproductive development in viviparous species, and thus, the black rockfish is considered an attractive viviparous fish model for studies on sperm storage, reproductive mode, and fertilization biology, among other biological issues of importance.Sperm storage is a common reproductive strategy among vertebrate species that are characterized by internal fertilization. Nevertheless, sperm storage time is a species-specific characteristic that varies from minutes to years.5 In black rockfish, females have been found to store sperm in their ovaries for up to 6 months. Furthermore, the state of sperm changes concomitant with ovary development, from swimming in the ovarian fluid to penetration of the ovigerous lamellae epithelium, subsequent reactivation, and finally fertilizing the eggs.2 The maintenance of sperm viability is dependent upon exogenous energy sources derived from the ovary microenvironment. The solute carriers (SLCs) superfamily is one of the most important membrane transporter families; SLCs are involved in the intercellular transport of substances, and transfer of energy, nutrients, and metabolites.60 In the present study, we found that the glucose transporter protein SLC2, a member of SLC superfamily, showed significantly positive selection in black rockfish genome. In mammals,61 including humans62 and mice,63 carbohydrates are positively correlated with the duration of sperm viability. Furthermore, in the present study, we found that many carbohydrate metabolism-related KEGG pathways that provide energy substrates sources showed significant up-regulation from pre- to post-copulation. These observations agree with our belief that during the storage stage, sperm in the female ovary is dependent on energy substrates derived from the surrounding microenvironment. We accordingly provided evidence in support of this hypothesis in vitro by demonstrating that in vitro suppression of glycolysis significantly reduced sperm longevity, thereby indicating the importance of carbohydrate sources in maintaining sperm survivability.In conclusion, this is the first study to conduct chromosomal-level sequencing of the genome of a viviparous marine teleost characterized by long-term sperm storage (up to 6 months) in female ovaries. Here, we obtained a genome assembly size of 848.31 Mb comprising 24 chromosomes, and contig and scaffold N50 lengths of 2.96 and 35.63 Mb, respectively. We predicted 39.98% repetitive elements, and 26,979 protein-coding genes; further our analysis determined that S. schlegelii diverged from Gasterosteus aculeatus ~32.1–56.8 million years ago. Genome, transcriptome, and in vitro sperm physiological analyses provided an insight into the carbohydrate substances produced in female ovaries in support of long-term sperm storage. Therefore, we believe our findings will provide an important genomic resource for researchers in the fields of marine and reproductive biology.This research was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFD0901205, 2018YFD0901204), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31572602, 31802278), China Agriculture Research System (CARS-47), Marine S & T Fund of Shandong Province for Pilot Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (2018SDKJ0302-4, 2018SDKJ0302-5), Chinese Academy of Science and Technology Service Network Planning (KFJ-EW-STS-060), Shandong Province Key Research and Invention Program (2017CXGC010K), and the National Infrastructure of Fishery Germplasm Resource (2019DKA30470).Accession numbersThe DNA sequence of PacBio, Illumina-short reads, 10× Genomic, and Hi-C were deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive database, under the accession number, SRP173183; the BioProject number is PRJNA509745.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAspergillus oryzae is an industrially important species mainly used in the manufacture of fermented foods in East Asia because of its strong amylase and protease activities.1 Particularly, in Japan, tane-koji (seed rice malt) manufacturers use various strains that are sold to companies producing fermented foods. These strains show diversity in colour and fermentation function and are managed for different applications such as in sake, miso (soybean paste), and shoyu (soy sauce). However, the relationship between the diversity of A. oryzae species and genetic factors remains unclear.In 2005, the whole genome of A. oryzae RIB40, a wild-type strain, was sequenced.2 Comparative genomic analysis of the whole genomes of Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus revealed that the A. oryzae genome was 7–9 Mb larger.2,3 However, genes in newly acquired regions are only minimally expressed under normal conditions,4 and most of their functions remain unknown, particularly for genes not directly involved in fermentation.Aspergillus flavus and A. oryzae are genetically very closely related, with their genomes showing 99.5% similarity in coding regions,5 and numerous comparative analyses have been performed between these species. Aspergillus flavus is an important species linked to food safety, as some strains produce fungal toxins, particularly aflatoxin,6,7 and it has historically been distinguished from A. oryzae based on morphological differences and toxicity.7,8 In addition, some A. oryzae strains contain all or parts of the aflatoxin biosynthetic gene cluster, although they are non-aflatoxigenic.6Some researchers suggested that A. oryzae can be detoxified and differentiated from A. flavus by domestication.1,9,10 Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 11 genes,9 comparative analysis of the aflatoxin gene cluster,11,12 and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the whole genome,13A. oryzae was shown to form a monophyletic clade derived from one clade of A. flavus.Aspergillus oryzae and A. flavus have long been considered asexual species with no sexual reproduction cycle.14 However, recent studies of A. flavus revealed that sexual reproduction occurs in laboratory and field environments.15,16 Genome analysis also showed that the two species contain a nearly complete gene set necessary for sexual reproduction.3,17 All strains of A. oryzae and A. flavus possess one mating type (MAT type) locus in the genome, at which either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 is encoded.17,18 However, complete sexual reproduction has not been confirmed in A. oryzae. Breeding currently carried out by tane-koji manufacturers utilizes a single strain with mutations or recombination, but crossbreeding has not been successful. Genome analysis suggested that recombination occurred between the ancestors of A. oryzae based on the linkage disequilibrium between MAT types and the phylogeny of a single gene.19In this study, to uncover genomic diversity and evolutionary relationships among A. oryzae isolates, we acquired 82 industrial strains from five independent Japanese tane-koji manufacturers in different locations and conducted whole-genome sequencing to determine their draft genomes. For the classification of these strains, we performed orthologue clustering of predicted genes from each genome, phylogenetic tree inference of the chromosomal genome, and chromosome recombination analysis. Through these analyses, we hypothesized that A. oryzae strains have undergone multiple inter-genomic recombination events between A. oryzae ancestors, and that evolutionary pressure by A. oryzae domestication is extremely limited to intra-genomic mutations and rearrangements. Moreover, we identified genes that are mutated/duplicated/deleted within clades, which might reflect the fact that Japanese tane-koji manufacturers have passaged their strains to prevent changes in industrially useful traits in parallel with breeding.2. Materials and methodsA full description of the methods, including software versions and parameters, is available in Supplementary Data (‘supplementary_methods.pdf’).2.1. Sample collection and DNA preparationFor genomic sequencing, 82 A. oryzae and three Aspergillus sojae (as an out group) industrially used strains were collected from five independent tane-koji manufacturers in Japan (Supplementary Table S1). Tane-koji manufacturers have their own isolates and have not shared them for several decades. Whole genomic DNA was extracted using ‘Extraction method5’.20 Yatalase was used for some samples (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyFor genome assembly, fragmented genome libraries were prepared based on 350 bp (for run no. 1) and 550 bp (for run no. 2–5) on average and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 system using 150 bp (for run no. 1) and 250 bp (for run no. 2–5) paired-end runs. Quality filtering and assembly of the paired-end reads were performed with Platanus.21 The scaffolds aligned to bacterial genomes or the mitochondrial genome of RIB40 were removed. The reference primer sequences for the MAT type17 were mapped to the genome sequences with bowtie2.222.3. Gene prediction and orthologous clusteringNext, 152 genomic scaffolds (85 from our samples and 67 from NCBI GenBank) of the newly sequenced or NCBI GenBank Aspergillus strains were used (Supplementary Table S2). Gene coding regions were predicted using two methods, namely, GeneMark-ES23 and AUGUSTUS24 for ab initio prediction, and GMAP25 for reference-based prediction, and these were combined with EVidenceModeler.26 The predicted protein sets were evaluated with BUSCO.27 Orthologue clustering was performed with OrthoFinder.28 Orthogroups (OGs) were annotated with GhostKOALA29 for protein function and InterProScan30 for protein motifs/domains.2.4. Comparative genomicsAlignments of degapped gene sequences (DGSs) of single-copy OGs (SCGs), which were common to 152 protein sets, were generated with MAFFT31 and tandemly concatenated. Maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic inference was performed with RAxML.32 Similarly, a concatenated gene tree of 19 SCGs in the aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster was generated. To test the neutrality of the mutation, revised coding sequences were generated from the alignments by clade/species and synonymous, non-synonymous, and gap mutations were counted. Chromosomal duplications and deletions were inferred by direct read mapping to the RIB40 genome with bowtie2. Depths were calculated with samtools.333. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe number of scaffolds (>1,000 bp) and total lengths were 36–256 and 35.9–38.66 Mb for A. oryzae and 45–71 and 40.0–40.1 Mb for A. sojae, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The two draft genome sizes were not significantly different from those reported previously.2,34 All samples were sequenced at depths of =100, but the depths of some samples from runs no. 3, no. 4, and no. 5 showed relatively low average coverage of the final scaffolds because the genomic DNA of Actinobacteria (Corynebacterium) used to produce yatalase was contaminated.3.2. Gene prediction and evaluationGene prediction for our sample showed that the number of predicted genes of A. oryzae and A. sojae were 11, 196–11, 716 and 13, 309–13, 317, respectively (Supplementary Table S2, column S). To confirm the accuracy of assembly and gene prediction, the predicted gene set and reference gene set were analyzed with BUSCO. In the complete genome of RIB40 (GCF_000184455.2), the score of the gene set was 98.6% in our prediction pipeline.3.3. Orthologue clusteringBy orthologue clustering, 15,614 OGs were created from 1,882,788 proteins, while 1,395 proteins became unclustered. Of these, 3,951 were common SCGs. We succeeded in the annotation of the KEGG KO and protein domains/motifs at 28.6% (4,465/15,614) and 88.0% (13,752/15,614) (Supplementary Table S3), and assigned locus IDs starting with ‘AO’ as defined previously2 to 13,006 OGs clustered with the A. oryzae RIB40 reference proteins (s01-m08-r29 or s01-m09-r06).3.4. Comparative genomicsThe length of the sequence of the concatenated DGSs of 4,361 SCGs was 5,677,852 columns (bp), corresponding to approximately 15% of the total genome length. We confirmed that A. oryzae was monophyletic and nested in a clade of A. flavus (Fig. 1, original full figure: Supplementary Fig. S1). This is consistent with the results of previous studies.9,11–13 In contrast, some putative A. flavus strains (WRRL1519, NRRL35739, IFM54693, IFM57535, IFM59975, IFM60655, and 2017 Washington T4) were nested in the A. oryzae clade. However, WRRL1519,35 NRRL35739, and the IFM strains36 were confirmed as non-aflatoxigenic with A. oryzae-type aflatoxin gene clusters (also confirmed in this study). Thus, considering the location in the phylogenetic tree and toxigenicity, these strains were reclassified as A. oryzae.

A–H: clade names for Japanese industrial strains defined in this study. AflaGuard, AF36, BP2-1, K, and SRCM are temporary clade names. Industrial strains of A. oryzae formed several clades, showing an intra-cladal DGS dissimilarity within 0.01%. For further analysis, we defined clades A–H to which Japanese industrial strains of A. oryzae belong. Although koji manufacturers do not share their strains, interestingly, many strains clustered in the same clade. Particularly, clade E included several strains provided by four different tane-koji manufacturers, one strain collected in Thailand (BCC7051),37 and one strain as a clinical isolate from Japan. In contrast, some Chinese and Korean industrial strains, namely, AS3.951, 100.8/3.042 (China),38 BP2-1, and the two SRCM strains (Korea), formed a group with a relatively large distance from the Japanese industrial strains. These strains were very closely related to each other but should be classified into different clades because of their different MAT types.Industrial A. oryzae strains were not clustered based on their industrial uses. However, all strains in clades D, E, and H (and a single strain TK-29) were those used in shoyu production. Strains used for other purposes such as in miso, sake, sake/miso, mirin, or other products were mixed in the same clade, which is consistent with classification by appearance and enzymatic activity.Of the 152 genomic sequences, MAT regions were uniquely detected as either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 from 146 sequences but not from six downloaded sequences (Fig. 1). We examined the presence/absence of genes in each strain and identified OG0012491/AO090020000089 as MAT1-1 and OG0012281 + OG0012282 as the MAT1-2 gene (these two were contiguous, and thus possibly merged into one gene). The identified region of MAT1-1 was consistent with that reported previously.19 The genes unique to each MAT type were only these MAT genes. All strains included in the same clade showed the same MAT type. Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the topology of the phylogenetic tree of concatenated genes and MAT type (e.g. A&B and G&H). This strongly suggests that clade divergence was caused not by mutation but rather by the recombination of different strains.In addition to MAT type, as an example of linkage disequilibrium, we also found that the phylogenetic tree of the concatenated gene showed a different topology from those of individual genes. For example, on comparing the phylogenetic tree of ytk6/OG0002894/AO090023000584 to that of mdlB/OG0004275/AO090701000644, the combinations of clades with the same sequence were different (Supplementary Fig. S2-1A and B). In addition, the phylogenetic trees of adjacent genes showed a similar topology. For each strain, we identified the closest clade along the chromosomal positions (Supplementary Methods 2.4.3). As a result, the genomes of all clades of A. oryzae and A. flavus exhibited high mosaic structures; regardless of the clades, the closest clade differed depending on the chromosomal position. For example, TK-22 (as a representative strain of clade A) shared 46% of the exact same gene sequences with clade B, but the homologous genes were distributed in a mosaic manner (Fig. 2, unsmoothed figure: Supplementary Fig. S3-1). From the distribution of similarity scores, we can see that some non-syntenic regions against clade B could be syntenic regions of clade F (Supplementary Fig. S3-5). This means that clades closer on the concatenated gene tree had larger proportions of homologous regions, and the pattern of syntenic regions depended on the clade to be compared. We also detected locally exclusively homologous regions among distant clades (Supplementary Fig. S2-2). This suggests that clade divergence was caused by multiple recombination events in multiple strains, at least as many times as the number of clades, and not by passage mutation in only one ancestral strain. Visualized chromosomal mixture of TK-22 of clade A. I–VIII represent chromosome numbers. Sequence depths are shown in the inner circle with black bars. Chromosomal mixture is shown in the outer circle with coloured bars, where heights represent similarity scores (percentage of identical gene sequences) and colours represent the closest clade.Visualized chromosomal mixture of TK-22 of clade A. I–VIII represent chromosome numbers. Sequence depths are shown in the inner circle with black bars. Chromosomal mixture is shown in the outer circle with coloured bars, where heights represent similarity scores (percentage of identical gene sequences) and colours represent the closest clade.In the A. oryzae clade, most genome regions were represented as a mixture with other A. oryzae clades; particularly, some were highly homologous to the A. flavus clade and vice versa. Thus, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of recombination between two species after speciation. However, because the exclusively homologous regions between the two species were very small, the strain used in this study might have been insufficient. Because our samples were biased toward practically used strains, information about wild-type strains of A. oryzae is lacking. Thus, the genomic mosaicism shown in this study does not directly represent the frequency of recombination. By analyzing more strains, the mosaic structure might be simplified and recombination processes in the clades could be clarified.In addition, because our samples were human-managed strains, it might be possible to track whether hybridization occurred among them. However, none of the clades appeared to be expressed as a mixture of two other clades. In contrast, there were some A. flavus strains for which genomes were represented by a mixture of two or three other strains (Supplementary Fig. S3-2). Interestingly, the genome of A. oryzae TK-27, a strain maintained by a tane-koji manufacturer for more than six decades and the use of which started in the 2000s, had an unusual structure; 85% or more of the genome was homologous to clade G, to which the MAT types were also identical, while some regions were closer to those of the other clades (Supplementary Fig. S3-3). A Chinese strain, AS3.951, and the strains in clade K showed a similar pattern, although they had different MAT types (Supplementary Fig. S3-4). However, they were not a clear mixture of any strain pair. Based on these results, we consider that the domestication process influenced the evolution of A. oryzae mostly through rearrangements within a single genome, and rarely via sexual recombination.3.5. Influence of domesticationOur results highlighted the fact that the ancestor of A. oryzae underwent multiple complex recombination events. In contrast, considering that no simple recombination mixtures between strains from the tane-koji manufacturer were observed and many strains belonged to the same clade with wild-type RIB40, clinical isolates, or the strain from Thailand, humans might have chosen strains from nature as suitable for brewing and maintained them without crossbreeding. Therefore, the influence of domestication on the evolution of A. oryzae likely appeared only after clade divergence, suggesting that the domestication process does not contribute to genetic recombination.In previous reports, vegetative compatibility group (VCG) divergence in A. flavus was estimated to have occurred 50,000–189,000 years ago.19 VCG is a self-identification system, and there are at least 13 VCGs in A. flavus.39 Considering that A. oryzae is monophyletic and nested in one of the clades of A. flavus based on the phylogenetic tree, and that A. oryzae is one type of VCG, the speciation of A. oryzae and A. flavus might have occurred contemporaneously. Domestication and industrial utilization of koji (rice malt) began in China over 3,000–2,000 years ago, and stocking and selling of these products began in Japan 700–500 years ago.1 Therefore, domestication likely began influencing the evolution of A. oryzae in the last 3,000 or 700 years after clade divergence (Fig. 3). Hypothesis for the influence of domestication on the evolution of Aspergillus oryzae.Hypothesis for the influence of domestication on the evolution of Aspergillus oryzae.In a previous study, mutational pressure was estimated by comparing the SNP frequencies of A. flavus and A. oryzae13 or by comparative genomics of RIB40 and RIB326.40 According to such studies, mutations tend to accumulate in non-synteny blocks (NSBs) and sub-telomeric regions. However, these estimates are considered to reflect the influence of selection pressure in nature during the period from species or clade divergence to domestication. Therefore, we focused on recently accumulated mutations or gene duplications/deletions by comparing them within each clade.We calculated the numbers of inter- and intra-cladal mutations in coding sequences for 14,711 SCGs present in 101 strains with BUSCO scores of 96 or more (Supplementary Method 2.4.5). There were a few intra-cladal mutations; in total, 265 synonymous mutations, 528 non-synonymous mutations, and 93 gap mutations were found in 201, 453, and 70 genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S4, 1–3), of which synonymous mutations were not prevalent enough for neutrality tests within each gene (Supplementary Table S4-4). Remarkably, however, the odds of the total number of intra-cladal non-synonymous/synonymous mutations were significantly higher than those of inter-cladal mutations in A. oryzae and much higher than those of intra-species mutations in A. flavus, with a similar tendency for gap/synonymous mutations (Table 1). This tendency was almost the same between synteny blocks (SB) and NSBs with A. nidulans/A. fumigatus (Supplementary Table S4-5). Total number of mutations in coding sequences of Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus flavusP < 1.0E-10.Total number of mutations in coding sequences of Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus flavusP < 1.0E-10.These results suggest that the influence of domestication, reflected by intra-cladal mutations and somewhat by inter-cladal mutations, causes the accumulation of non-neutral mutations changing gene functionality, such as loss of function. Even though there were no genes with sufficient number of inter-cladal mutations for the calculation of odds or P values (Supplementary Table S4-4), we found 1–4 intra-cladal non-synonymous or gap mutations among all the named genes (Table 2). For example, both intra-cladal non-synonymous and gap mutations were found in two annotated genes, specifically wA/OG0003175/AO090102000545 and laeA/OG0001970/AO0900030000489. A. oryzae wA is an industrially important polyketide synthase gene, an orthologue of A. nidulans wA, which is required for the synthesis of a green pigment.41 The down-regulation of the A. oryzae wA gene leads to the production of white conidia.42 Non-synonymous or gap mutations in wA were only found in some white mutants of clade A, C, and G used for miso production wherein the control of product color is important. laeA is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in Aspergillus,43 and it is also involved in the production of kojic acid.44Annotated genes with intra-cladal non-synonymous/gap mutationsAnnotated genes with intra-cladal non-synonymous/gap mutationsInterestingly, a few mutations in catabolic enzymes were considered industrially useful; moreover, no intra-cladal non-synonymous or gap mutations were found in known proteolytic enzyme-encoding genes. In contrast, there were several non-synonymous/gap mutations in genes involved in expression, signaling, secondary metabolites, secretion/transporters, and cell traits (Table 2). Therefore, the domestication process might have contributed to altering the traits of strains while maintaining the activity of industrially useful catalytic enzyme-encoding genes by applying selective pressure to those peripheral genes rather than enzyme-encoding genes. This might reflect the fact that Japanese tane-koji manufacturers have continued to passage their strains to prevent changes in their traits in parallel with breeding.We estimated gene duplication/deletion by direct read mapping and calculation of the normalized depth, equal to the copy number of genes (Supplementary Table S5). As a result, we found 221 OGs (117 SCGs) with different estimated copy numbers in at least one clade and 179 OGs (20 SCGs) in more than two clades. We performed statistical analysis on KEGG BRITE annotation but found no significant feature (number of total detection > 1, P = 0.05, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that selection pressure for gene duplication is not explained by gene function. The estimated copy numbers of OG0000041/PF03221/Tc5 transposase and OG0000321/PF14529/endonuclease-reverse transcriptase, which are transposon-derived genes, had changed more than twice as compared with that in RIB40; in particular, the clade B and G strains showed 15–20 times the estimated copy number. Furthermore, rRNA genes exhibited a wide range in estimated copy number (e.g. it varied 13–48-fold among eight strains of clade C without bacterial contamination from yatalase). However, the selective pressure on rRNA gene duplication is hard to estimate, because a previous report showed strain-dependent copy number variation in rRNA genes in A. fumigatus by quantitative PCR,45 suggesting that the duplication of rRNA genes is likely to occur in the natural environment. The estimated copy number of the tRNA gene also tended to vary, and intra-cladal change was observed at 102/276 tRNA gene loci.As a general trend, changes in the sequence depth were more frequent in the sub-telomeric region (Supplementary Fig. S4-1, Chr. I, Fig. S4-2). Change in depth was also observed in the sub-centromeric regions, which represents changes in the number of non-coding repeats in the unassembled region. In contrast, in some strains, a 60–70-kbp region containing tRNA genes (e.g. Supplementary Fig. S4-1, Chr. III/V) was duplicated, which might have drastically altered transcription or translation.Three copies of a-amylase (amyA/amyB/amyC/OG0011956) have been detected in RIB40.2 We found both intra-cladal and inter-cladal variation in the duplication number of OG0011956 (a-amylase) as follows: three to four copies in clade A, two to three copies in clade D/E, two copies in clade B, and four copies in clade G. Similarly, we found one copy in TK-24/TK-29 and four copies in TK-27. Moreover, the A. sojae strains TK-83, TK-84, and TK-85 had one copy, which is consistent with previous studies.34,46The types of aflatoxin biosynthetic gene clusters in A. oryzae, including those in all of our samples (confirmed as non-aflatoxigenic) and strains estimated to be A. oryzae in this study, were classified into three groups as defined in a previous study.6 Moreover, we found that Kusumoto Group 3 was nested in Group 2, while Group 1 was located far from the other two (Supplementary Fig. S5). Aflatoxin cluster sequences were not clustered by their toxigenicity, suggesting that detoxification in A. oryzae/A. flavus had occurred in parallel. This is consistent with a previous report inferring that the selective pressure against toxins was lost in nature.19 Because the non-toxicity of A. oryzae is phylogenetically guaranteed, tane-koji manufacturers might have distinguished A. oryzae from A. flavus based on their growth ability on rice and incidentally selected aflatoxicity.3.6. Concluding remarksWe acquired 82 industrial strains from five Japanese tane-koji manufacturers and conducted whole-genome sequencing to determine their draft genomes. Through phylogenetic tree-based inferences of the chromosomal genome and chromosome recombination analysis, we showed that A. oryzae strains have undergone multiple inter-genomic recombination events between A. oryzae ancestors. However, sexual recombination among domesticated species did not appear to have occurred during the domestication process, at least in the past few decades; therefore, we hypothesized that evolutionary pressure introduced by the domestication of A. oryzae is extremely limited to intra-genomic mutation and rearrangements. Through intra- and inter-cladal comparative analysis, we showed that the evolutionary pressure of domestication selectively caused non-synonymous and gap mutations and intra-genomic recombination. Our results suggest that the domestication process might have contributed to altering strain traits while maintaining the activity of industrially useful catalytic enzyme genes by applying selective pressure to peripheral genes involved in fermentation rather than the enzyme-encoding genes themselves.Our study provides suggestions on the relationship between the evolution and domestication of A. oryzae, and importantly, the whole genomic data and phylogenetic tree will help to develop breeding methods based on sexual reproduction using industrial strains.We thank Gurunavi, Inc. for providing financial support and Akita Konno Co., Ltd.; Bio’c Co., Ltd.; Higuchi Moyashi Higuchi Matsunosuke Shoten Co., Ltd.; Hishiroku Co., Ltd.; and Nihon Jyozo Kogyou Co., Ltd. for providing strains.

IntroductionIn protein coding genes, the synonymous codons of amino acids are not used randomly. Biases in codon usage are thought to result from selection for translational efficiency and/or accuracy.1–9 Mutational pressures can also shape codon usage.5,10–13 Translational selection in many organisms has been supported by findings that the highly transcribed genes preferentially use a subset of codons, often described as ‘optimal’ codons,2,6,12–18 and has been observed in bacteria,5,6,17 fungi,16,19,20 plants,2,14,21 and animals, including spiders22 and insects (e.g. Drosophila, Aedes, Anopheles, Gryllus, and Oncopeltus, and weakly observed in Bombyx2,15,23–27). Whole genome data show that optimal codons typically have correspondingly high numbers of iso-accepting tRNA gene copies in the genome, reflecting an organism’s relative tRNA abundance,1,5,6,19,20,28 and consistent with selection for translational optimization.1,4,5,18,20,25,29–32 The utility of tRNA gene number to quantify organismal tRNA abundance has been supported in vivo in bacteria and eukaryotes.28,33,34 For instance, the addition of tRNA genes for a codon of a specific amino acid to the Escherichia coli genome markedly improved translation rates of genes containing that amino acid.28 In this regard, the increased use of optimal codons in highly transcribed genes,2,5,14 and the correspondence of these codons to abundant tRNA genes,1,4 suggest that selection may favour optimization for cost efficient and/or accurate translation.In contrast to unicellular systems, in multicellular organisms measuring codon usage can be complicated by the plurality of tissues, as optimal codons and tRNA populations may vary among tissue types.35–37 For instance, cellular tRNA abundances can vary among tissues or cell types for at least some codons,36,38,39 suggesting that translational selection may differ among tissues.36 This has also been supported by findings of some variation in codon use of genes transcribed in different tissues in the few organisms studied to date. For example, in the plant Arabidopsis, the use of specific codons in a gene depends on the tissue type in which the gene is maximally expressed, suggesting this species has localized tRNA populations,37 a pattern that has also been proposed for rice.40 Although similar studies in metazoans have been rare, a recent investigation in Drosophila melanogaster showed that codons associated with elevated expression were not universal across tissues. For example, AAT was more commonly used than AAC for Asn in some tissues (e.g. testis and hindgut), while TGT was favoured over TGC for Cys in the salivary glands. These observations were interpreted as providing evidence of tissue-specific tRNA populations.35 Additional studies are warranted to determine the universality of distinct optimal codon identities in various tissues of an organism. In particular, the germ line and somatic tissues comprise contrasts of significant interest, as the former directly determines an organism’s reproductive success and fitness, and experiences haploid selection in the meiotic and sex cells, such that translational optimization may be particularly relevant to those tissues.While much attention has been focussed on optimal codons in the literature, growing experimental research, largely from single-celled models or in vitro systems, suggests that non-optimal codons, those codons least used in highly transcribed genes (and/or codons defined as ‘rare’ in some studies), can also play significant regulatory roles in translation.33,41,42 In yeast, for example, it was shown that cells altered their tRNA populations under stress and had increased levels of tRNAs that matched the rare codons found in stress-response genes, thus allowing the preferential translation of those mRNAs under stressful conditions, without any change in mRNA abundance.43 Findings in cyanobacteria have indicated that circadian rhythms are regulated post-transcriptionally based on non-optimized codon use in genes of the kaiABC1 cluster.44 Further, non-optimal codons have been shown to slow rates of translational elongation and to control ribosome traffic on mRNA, which allows proper co-translational protein folding and/or functionality, based on in vitro cell-free translation systems from Neurospora7 and Drosophila.9 Non-optimal codons have also been found to facilitate co-translational protein folding in various yeast models.45 These data show that the use of one or a few types of rare codon(s) in a gene may markedly affect its translation, depending on the tRNA pool, suggesting that the supply–demand relationship between non-optimal codons and their matching tRNA abundances could comprise an adaptive mechanism of translational regulation.33,43–47 To further understand this phenomenon, genomics and molecular evolution research on codon usage patterns in animal systems should expand beyond the typical focus on optimal codons, and specifically include assessments of non-optimal codons, and their relationships to tRNA genes.In addition to non-optimal codons per se, some studies have indicated that the use of codons that have no matching tRNA, and obligately require wobble codon–anticodon tRNAs (wobbly at the third nucleotide of the codon) may also influence translation.33 For instance, an investigation in four divergent eukaryotes found that the relative translation levels of cell-cycling gene mRNAs during various stages of the cell cycle depend on the frequency of codons lacking corresponding tRNA gene copies in the genome, and thus requiring wobble tRNA.48 Further, experimental research in yeast, human cells, and nematodes has shown that obligatory use of wobble tRNA decelerates translational elongation by slowing ribosomal translocation on the mRNA.33,49,50 In this regard, the use of codons that require wobble tRNA could have a significant effect on translational dynamics, particularly in slowing translation,33 and thus should also be considered in studies of codon usage patterns in an organism.A metazoan species providing a promising pathway for the comprehensive study of codon usage in a multicellular system is the Coleopteran rust red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. T. castaneum is a long standing model for genetics and developmental biology, has a well characterized genome,18,51,52 and is estimated to have diverged from the fellow insect Drosophila approximately 300 Mya.53–57 While a prior pioneering study had identified a putative list of optimal codons for T. castaneum,18 the approach used in that study involved correlation analyses between codon frequency and expression level. Given that this method has been thought to often be poorly suited to revealing optimal codons, defined as those most common in highly transcribed genes,1,5,58 analyses of codon use in this taxon would benefit from being revisited with alternative methods. Optimal codons can be most readily revealed via direct contrasts of codon usage in the highest versus lowest expressed genes in the genome, also known as the contrast method.2,13–17,21,24,58 At present, as is the case for most multicellular model organisms, a multifaceted integrative approach has not yet been applied to assessments of codon usage in this beetle taxon, including the identification of optimal and non-optimal codons in highly transcribed genes at an organism-wide level, and within the somatic versus germ line tissues, nor have assessments been available of the links between codon usage and tRNA gene counts, wobble tRNA, and gene functionality.In the present study, we address these outstanding issues on codon usage in T. castaneum using genome-wide protein-sequence datasets (CDS) and large-scale transcriptome datasets from the male and female germ lines and somatic tissues [testes, ovaries, gonadectomized (GT-) males, and GT-females].59 From these data, we rigorously study optimal and non-optimal codons in this taxon, and their relationships to tRNA abundances and gene ontology. We report strong evidence for organism-wide optimal codons in all four tissue types and both sexes. The majority of these optimal codons have abundant matching tRNAs (Opt-codon<U+2191>tRNA status), consistent with pervasive translational selection for efficient and/or accurate protein synthesis in this species. A minority of optimal codons vary among the four tissues, suggesting small, but potentially meaningful, differences in tRNA populations between tissue types. Crucially, we report that a subset of the optimal codons did not have direct tRNA matches, and thus presumably obligately required wobble tRNA for translation (Opt-codonwobble), which we propose may comprise a mechanism for slowing translation for accuracy or protein-folding purposes. Finally, we find that a number of non-optimal codons unexpectedly have abundant perfectly matching tRNA gene copies (Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs) and that these rare codons are preferentially used in genes with specific functions, including ribosomal protein genes and stress-response genes. Thus, we hypothesize that the use of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status may be a potential mechanism to ensure preferential translation of specific gene mRNAs. Collectively, our results reveal the multiple roles of codon usage in this beetle, suggesting not just pervasive selection for the use of specific codons in highly transcribed genes for efficient and/or accurate translation, but also translational regulatory roles of wobble codons and of non-optimal codons.2. Materials and methods2.1. Tribolium castaneum CDSThe annotated CDS of our main target species T. castaneum (v.5.2) were downloaded from Ensembl Metazoa (http://metazoa.ensembl.org) and are also available at BeetleBase.51,52 The full CDS per gene (longest CDS per gene, N = 16,434) was used for the study of codon usage. The full genome and its descriptive GFF file were also downloaded for assessments.2.2. Biological samples and RNA-seqWe aimed to determine the expression level (FPKM) for each of 16,434 genes in T. castaneum for germ line and somatic tissues. For this we generated large-scale RNA-seq datasets for the ovaries, testes, GT-females, and GT-males, shown in Supplementary Table S1.59 The T. castaneum specimens were provided by the Brown lab at KSU (https://www.k-state.edu/biology/people/tenure/brown/). Samples were grown under standard conditions until adulthood and tissue dissections were then performed on unmated adults (a total of 150 animals per sex per biological replicate). RNA was extracted and processed for RNA-seq as described previously.592.3. Gene expressionThe RNA-seq reads (76 bp) per sample were trimmed of adapters and poor-quality bases using the program BBduk available from the Joint Genome Initiative (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) set at default parameters.Gene expression level was determined for the 16,434 genes (CDS) as FPKM after mapping each RNA-seq dataset per tissue to the full CDS list for each species using Geneious Read Mapper,60 which yielded highly similar results as other common mappers such as BBmap (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/; data not shown). The average FPKM across samples per tissue type (Supplementary Table S1) was used to measure expression per tissue. FPKM values were highly correlated between replicates of each sample type (Spearman’s Ranked R > 0.9, P < 2×10-7).2.4. Identification of optimal and non-optimal codonsFor identification of the optimal codons, we measured the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) per codon per amino acid for each gene under study using CAICal.61 RSCU values indicate the relative usage of a codon in a synonymous codon family, and values >1 and <1 indicate favoured and unfavoured usage as compared with that expected under equal usage of all codons, respectively. Greater relative RSCU values among codons indicates elevated usage. For each of the 18 amino acids in the genetic code with synonymous codons (note that Trp and Met only have one codon each), we identified the optimal codon using the contrast method.13–15,17,21,24,58,62 For this, we determined the difference in RSCU (<U+0394>RSCU) per codon between genes with the highest 5% versus the lowest 5% expression. The primary optimal codon for each amino acid was defined as the codon with the highest and statistically significant positive <U+0394>RSCU value, indicating preferred usage in highly transcribed genes.13–15,17,21,24,58,62 The primary non-optimal codon per amino acid was defined as the codon with the largest negative and statistically significant <U+0394>RSCU value, indicating low usage in highly transcribed genes. Statistical significance per codon was applied using a t-test between RSCU values across all genes for high versus low expressed genes.As the literature reflects some variation in codon use terminology among studies to date, we explicitly define the term ‘optimal codons’ herein as those codons most used in highly transcribed genes based on <U+0394>RSCU, which infers an innate advantage of the codon under high transcription. Then, we secondarily assessed each optimal codon’s correspondence to the number of matching (codon–anticodon) tRNA genes in order to test their role in translational accuracy/efficiency1,4,5,18,20,25,28–32 or to infer possible other functions (e.g. wobble codons for translational slowing). For non-optimal codons, a similar approach was used wherein the non-optimal codon status was identified based solely on <U+0394>RSCU, and their relationships to tRNA were then separately assessed.The frequency of optimal codons (Fop) is a measure of the degree of optimal codon usage per gene.6 Fop was determined in CodonW63 using the primary optimal codons identified herein. Fop was also determined using the primary optimal codons previously identified by Williford and Demuth 2012.18 As multiple codons per amino acid were classified as optimal in that assessment, we defined each primary optimal codon from the study as that with the strongest average positive correlation across tissues for measuring Fop.For an additional layer of stringency, we wished to exclude the possibility that expression-mediated mutational biases towards specific nucleotides, which have been observed to some extent in certain organisms to date (e.g. E. coli, humans64,65), contribute towards codon differences among high and low expressed genes herein. For this, we extracted all introns for every gene in the genome (those with introns) using the GFF file available (see section 2.1). Introns are thought to be mostly selectively neutral,18,66 and thus their nucleotide content should reflect any underlying mutational pressures in the genome, and on the nucleotide composition of synonymous codons in an organism.13,18,66 If mutational pressures on introns are not associated with gene expression level, this factor may be excluded as causing optimal codons in the highly expressed genes, further suporting a role for selection in optimal codon distribution. All introns that were >50bp were extracted as the regions between exons and were concatenated per gene. The association between intronic GC content and expression level was assessed using a scatter plot and Spearman’s ranked R.2.5. Identification of tRNA genesTo assess whether or how the optimal and non-optimal codons were related to the tRNA gene copy number, we determined the number of iso-accepting tRNA genes per codon in the genome (T. castaneum v. 5.2) using tRNA-scan SE.18,52,67 The list of tRNA gene numbers identified in the current genome version was identical to that reported previously18 and is shown in Table 1.

GO functionsThe predicted GO functions were determined using Panther68 using the option for T. castaneum as species.2.7. Data availabilityThe CDS and genome v. 5.2 for T. castaneum are available at Ensembl Metazoa (http://metazoa.ensembl.org). RNA-seq data for all samples from T. castaneum described in Supplementary Table S1 are available at the SRA database under Bio-project number PRJNA564136.3. Results and discussion3.1. Optimal codons in T. castaneumWe first report the organism-wide, or global, optimal codon per amino acid for T. castaneum using <U+0394>RSCU and the average expression levels of all annotated genes across all four studied tissue types (testis, ovary, GT-male, and GT-female) in Table 1. The primary optimal codon, defined as the codon with the largest positive <U+0394>RSCU between highly and lowly transcribed genes and with P < 0.05), was identified for 17 of the 18 amino acids with synonymous codons. Seven primary optimal codons ended in T, three in A, five in C, and two in G. We noted that Ile had two codons with nearly identical <U+0394>RSCU values. Further, CAC for His showed signs of optimal codon usage in several individual tissues (see following section), and including this codon yields a study-wide total of 18 optimal codons (Table 1). The range of <U+0394>RSCU values was similar to or larger than that observed in other multicellular eukaryotes, including nematode species, Drosophila, Populus, and Neurospora.2,14–16 Thus, the patterns in Table 1 are consistent with the hypothesis that selection pressures have favoured the use of a specific subset of codons in highly expressed genes5 (for results on non-optimal codons see Section 3.4).While the striking use of specific optimal codons in genes under high expression levels in Table 1 in itself provides evidence of selection on codon usage, we wished to include additional layers of stringency to affirm the role of selection in favouring these codons. First, we determined the frequency of optimal codons (Fop), a measure of the degree of optimal codon usage per gene,6 for all studied genes in the genome (N = 16,434). As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that the Fop increased from genes with low (lowest 5% in the genome), to moderate (5–95%), to high (highest 5%) expression levels (Ranked ANOVA and Dunn’s paired test P < 0.05). As low and high expressed genes were used to identify the optimal codons, the Fop was, as expected, lowest and highest in those categories of genes, respectively. Importantly, however, moderately expressed genes, which were not used to identify the optimal codons, showed intermediate Fop values, suggesting a genome-wide tendency for greater use of optimal codons in CDS with elevated expression. Second, as codon usage can vary with protein length in some eukaryotes,2,5,69 we repeated the assessment in Fig. 1A using genes with similar CDS lengths, which we binned into short (<150 codons), medium (=150 to <300), and long CDS (=300). For each of these three length categories, we found the same stepwise increase of Fop values with expression level (Ranked-ANOVAs P < 0.001). Thus, the link between expression and optimal codons cannot be explained by protein length. Third, from examination of introns, wherein nucleotide content is mostly shaped by mutational pressures,18,66,70 we found that the GC (and thus AT) content of introns was uncorrelated to gene expression level (Spearman’s correlation R= -0.09, Fig. 1B),71,72 and thus indicates an absence of expression-mediated mutational biases12,64,65,70 in this species. Further to this point, unlike some organisms wherein optimal codons typically end in only two or three types of nucleotides,2,14,21,24 all four nucleotides are represented at the terminal position of optimal codons of this species (Table 1); this also excludes mutational biases in shaping the optimal codons in highly transcribed genes in this taxon.5 Taken together, while we do not exclude the possibility that non-selective (mutational) mechanisms may contribute towards codon use of genes, particularly those under low or even moderate expression,73 our observations indicate that a history of selection pressures likely plays a significant role in shaping the codon use of the most highly transcribed genes (top 5% expression) in this organism (Table 1). (A) Box plots of the frequency of optimal codons (Fop) across all 16,434 genes studied in T. castaneum.

Most, but not all, optimal codons are the same across germ line and somatic tissuesTo compare optimal codon usage among the tissues under study, we next determined the optimal codons (using <U+0394>RSCU) using genes with high versus low expression (top and lowest 5%) separately for each of the four individual tissue types, ovaries, testes, GT-females, and GT-males. For rigour in this assessment, we identified the subset of genes in the top 5% expression class that were only in the top category for one tissue type (and were not in the top 5% expression class in any of the other three tissues), to discern whether or not there was a tissue effect on optimal codons. Under these criteria, we identified 372, 450, 444, and 272 genes for analysis, for ovaries, testes, GT-females, and GT-males, respectively. This allowed us to specifically assess the codon usage of genes that were maximally transcribed only in one individual tissue, as it has been found that if tissue type has an effect on codon use, this effect is most apt to be evident in its highly transcribed genes.37 The results for <U+0394>RSCU per tissue type are shown in Table 1. We report that 15 of the 18 primary optimal codons (including His) from the organism-wide assessment were identified as having the same optimal codon in three, or all four, of the individual tissue types (Table 1). Thus, the vast majority of primary optimal codons were the same in these divergent tissues, including male and female germ lines and somatic tissue types.However, several significant differences were also observed among tissues. For example, a male-specific primary optimal codon was identified for the amino acid Phe (with two synonymous codons), as the codon TTC was optimal in the testes and GT-males, but not in the ovaries or GT-females (Table 1). Similarly, a GT-male-specific primary optimal codon ATC was identified for Ile (with three synonymous codons), whereas ATT was optimal for the other three tissues. In turn, an ovary-specific optimal codon was evident for Pro (with four synonymous codons), as the primary optimal codon was CCC in all tissues except for the ovaries, where it was CCT. In addition, a GT-female optimal codon was identified for Lys (two synonymous codons), where AAG was optimal in the ovaries, testes, and GT-males, but its alternate codon AAA was optimal for GT-females. These examples show that the primary optimal codon varies among tissue types in this beetle. This pattern therefore suggests that translational selection regimes, and thus corresponding tRNA populations may also vary among tissues.35 Further, it is worth noting that in some cases there may be tissue-specific preferences for codons using wobble tRNA (e.g. ATC for Ile in GT-males, see Section 3.3).These present results are consistent with the few available studies of tissue-specific codon usages and translational selection from the fellow insect D. melanogaster35 and in studied plants37,40 (note that although some evidence suggests humans have tissue-specific optimal codons, this has been debated, and may largely be an effect of the GC content of isochores74,75). Together, while the vast majority of optimal codons are shared across tissues in these beetles, non-negligible differences are observed between tissues and sexes. Direct quantification of tRNAs in cells or tissues has been mostly restricted to date to lab models of bacteria, yeast, or in vitro human cell lines,36,38,39,43,76 and the accuracy and limitations of the various approaches used for tRNA quantification (microarrays, Northern blot, quantitative PCR, and RNA-seq) remains debated.39,43,77,78 Nevertheless, the development of robust methods to sequence tRNAs that are applicable to non-traditional model organisms will allow further tests of whether or how tRNA expression levels vary with tissues in T. castaneum, as is strongly suggested by these results.353.3. A majority of organism-wide optimal codons have high tRNA gene copy numbersGiven the minimal differences among tissues, for our remaining analyses, we focus on the organism-wide optimal codon usages (Table 1). The number of tRNA gene copies in the genome has commonly been used as a measure of the relative abundance of each tRNA species.1,4,18,20,28,29,48 If optimal codon usage were consistently a result of selection in response to abundant tRNAs, then the primary optimal codon per amino acid should also have high relative tRNA gene frequency (Opt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status). When using the organism-wide optimal codon list (Table 1), we found that 12 of the primary optimal codons also had the highest, or near the highest, tRNA gene counts of all codons per amino acid: GCT (Ala), AGA (Arg), AAC (Asn), CAA (Gln), GAA (Glu), ATT (Ile), TTG (Leu), AAG (Lys), TTC (Phe), ACT (Thr), TAC (Tyr), and GTT (Val). Further, while the positive <U+0394>RSCU of CAC for His was not statistically significant using the organism-wide assessment (P = 0.26), this codon was optimal when individually considered in the ovaries, GT-females, and GT-males (P < 0.05), and had seven matching tRNA genes. Thus, including CAC for His as a codon with optimal status yields a study-wide total of 13 of the 18 primary optimal codons that have plentiful matching tRNA genes. In other words, a majority of optimal codons have Opt<U+2191>tRNA status. These results strongly suggest translational selection for accuracy and/or efficiency1,4 across the majority of amino acids in this beetle.While 13 optimal codons had a high number of direct tRNA matches as expected under selection for optimization of efficient and accurate translation, for the remaining 5 amino acids, a much different pattern was observed. Specifically, the primary optimal codon (highly used in abundant transcripts) had no direct matching tRNA genes, and a wobble tRNA (shown in Table 1) must thus be employed for translation of these codons (denoted as Opt-codonwobble). For instance, Opt-codonwobble status was observed for the amino acids Asp (GAT), Cys (TGT), Gly (GGT), Pro (CCC), and Ser (AGT). Thus, this result shows that while these identified optimal codons are preferred in highly transcribed genes, their innate benefit cannot be due to having abundant direct matching tRNA, and thus another mechanism must explain their high usage. Further, as shown in Supplementary Text File S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1, within the group of highly transcribed genes, each of these five individual codons with Opt-codonwobble status showed strong associations with protein length, suggesting putatively significant roles of the use of these types of codons in the translation of abundant mRNAs, which may vary with the length of the translated sequence.Experimental studies in bacteria and eukaryotic models have shown that codons using wobble tRNA act to slow translation by decelerating the translocation of ribosomes on mRNA.33,49,50 In addition, a study of the genomes of various eukaryotes (humans, yeast, and Arabidopsis) indicated that cell-cycle genes had high usage of codons that had no matching tRNA genes in the genome, and thus must employ wobble tRNA, which inherently have lower codon–anticodon binding affinity than those codons with perfect matches.48 The differential use of codons using wobble tRNA in cell-cycle genes, combined with potential oscillations in tRNA abundances, were proposed to differentially regulate the translation rates of these mRNAs during various stages of the cell cycle.48 Further, this was speculated to possibly comprise a broader evolutionarily conserved phenomenon for translational regulation in eukaryotes.48 In addition, the usage of wobble tRNAs in a gene could have some parallel functions to the use of non-optimal codons with low tRNA abundance (Nonopt-codon<U+2193>tRNAs; see Table 1 for non-optimal codons with few tRNAs) which can prevent jamming of multiple ribosomes during the initiation of translation,34 and/or slow or pause translation during elongation, which would facilitate accurate protein folding.7,9,38,79 In this regard, the results from these various studies suggest that the slowing of translation that is induced by wobble tRNA33,49,50 could comprise an evolutionarily conserved mechanism shaping various aspects of translation.Significantly, a key modification that mediates wobbling at the first anticodon position (position 34 of the anticodon loop) involves A34, which may be engnzymatically deaminated by adenosine deaminase tRNA (ADATs) to form inosine (I34). The resulting I34 can pair with mRNA 3'codon bases A, C, or U in Eukarya80,81 [see also for an A37 ADAT (Adat1) in D. melanogaster82]. For A34 modifications in eukaryotes, available research to date suggests that deamination requires the ADAT2/ADAT3 (hetADAT) enzymes, which are thought to allow A34 modifications across diverse eukaryotic systems.80,83 This modification would be essential for some codons obligately requiring wobble tRNA (those with no matching tRNAs and no matching unmodified wobble tRNAs) in the highly transcribed genes studied here, including codons with Opt-codonwobble status (e.g. Pro, CCC, Table 1). Thus, in addition to wobble codons using unmodified tRNAs, further functional study of ADATs is warranted in model insects, such as T. castaneum, including possible variation in expression and activity among tissues. This will help to further ascertain the potential consequences of use of wobble codons requiring tRNA modification at A34 on translation rates and protein folding.41,80,83Taken together, we hypothesize here that for this beetle, the use of codons with Opt-codonwobble status in highly expressed genes comprises a mechanism to slow or pause translation at various sites, which may lead to increased accuracy of translation or allow co-translational protein folding.49 In addition, the high frequency of five specific codons with Opt-codonwobble status in genes with abundant mRNAs (Table 1) suggests that these codons might also play a significant role in post-transcriptional differential regulation of protein levels48 in these beetles. Additional studies of protein levels of genes with high usage of codons with Opt-codonwobble status will be needed to further test this aspect of the hypothesis.3.4. Certain non-optimal codons have abundant tRNA genesHerein, we defined the primary non-optimal codon per amino acid stringently as the codon with the largest negative <U+0394>RSCU per amino acid, rather than simply all codons that were not optimal. Using these data, we assessed whether those codons with low usage in highly transcribed genes also exhibit few tRNA gene copies, as might be expected if codon usage is mostly shaped by translational selection for efficient and accurate translation (i.e. for adaptation of optimal codons and tRNA abundance). The organism-wide primary non-optimal codons (per amino acid) are shown in Table 1.The results showed that some non-optimal codons, as expected, had low numbers of matching tRNA genes [Nonopt-codon<U+2193>tRNAs status, e.g. two tRNA genes for ACG (Thr), ATA (Ile), and TTA (Leu), one for CCG (Pro)]. Unexpectedly, however, certain non-optimal codons had relatively moderate to high tRNA gene abundance (denoted as Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs). For instance, for Arg, while the codon CGG had no tRNA gene copies, its sister non-optimal codon CGA (<U+0394>RSCU= -0.290 and -0.265, respectively) had four tRNA gene matches. For Gly, both the primary and secondary non-optimal codons GGC and GGA (-0.104 and -0.077, respectively) had 8 and 15 matching tRNA gene copies, respectively. For Val, the primary non-optimal codon GTA had five tRNA genes, only slightly lower than the seven observed for its optimal codon GTT. We noted that if we relaxed our definition of a non-optimal codon to consider any codon that is not optimal, we found that some of those codons also had many corresponding tRNA genes. For example, for Pro, the non-optimal codon CCA (which had a weak and nonsignificant positive <U+0394>RSCU value, +0.029, and thus would not have satisfied our strict definition of having the largest negative <U+0394>RSCU for this amino acid) had 13 tRNA genes, an extraordinarily high value compared with other codons. Moreover, for Asp, the (less stringently) defined non-optimal codon GAC had 10 matching tRNA copies. Collectively, it is evident that codons that are not the optimal codons in this taxon are not inevitably linked to a low abundance of matching tRNA genes, and rather in some cases exhibit high matching tRNA gene counts. Thus, these patterns suggest it is possible that non-optimal codons with elevated tRNAs play a specific regulatory role for highly transcribed genes.A recent study in yeast has indicated that stress genes may preferentially use non-optimal codons that have abundant iso-accepting tRNA genes, to increase effective gene expression by promoting their translation over other proteins rather than affecting mRNA levels.43 Based on this notion, we hypothesize here that codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status in T. castaneum may regulate the translation of abundant mRNAs of proteins with specific functions in this beetle. To further evaluate this possibility, we examined the predicted gene ontology functions of the highly transcribed genes that had relatively elevated usage of non-optimal codons with abundant matching tRNAs.We assessed the GO functions of highly transcribed genes (top 5% in the genome from the organism-wide analyses across all four tissues, N = 822; and a cut-off of 103.3 FPKM) that had relatively elevated use of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status (Table 1). For this assessment, rather than assess all strictly defined non-optimal codons, we chose as examples the codons GGC for Gly, GTA for Val, and CGA for Arg. These three codons were defined as non-optimal by our strict definition (having a large negative and statistically significant <U+0394>RSCU, Table 1) and had substantial matching tRNA gene copy counts (four to eight tRNA genes each). These codons also had negative <U+0394>RSCU values in all four of the tissue types studied (Table 1), indicating they consistently have non-favoured status in this organism.For the amino acid Gly, we identified those highly transcribed genes that had RSCU values for GGC of >1.5. An RSCU value of 1 is expected for each of the four Gly codons under equal usage, and thus values of 1.5–4 for GGC are relatively high. Thus, while Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs are by definition rare in highly expressed genes, this approach allowed us to specifically examine the functions of this group (of highly expressed genes) that had unusually elevated use (RSCU) of this codon with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status. A total of 20.4% of the highly transcribed gene set was in this class. As shown in Table 2, these genes included those involved in oxidative stress response, such as peroxiredoxin, and those involved in olfactory activity. Thus, we speculate that these types of genes, which use codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status, will exhibit less tRNA competition during translation elongation than those genes that use codons with few or no matching tRNA genes, such as the fellow Gly codon GGG (with only one tRNA match), or even those genes using non-optimal codons for other amino acids, such as CCG for Pro (with one tRNA match) (Table 1). In addition, we found that genes with elevated GGC frequency encoded numerous (N = 15) ribosomal proteins. Thus, this finding suggests that usage of the non-optimal codon GGC may shape translation via a second mechanism: namely, by shaping the cellular abundance of specific ribosomal proteins per se, which are needed for translation. In this regard, the non-optimal codon usage profiles in Gly appear consistent with a hypothesis wherein the usage of GGC regulates the translation of a subset of genes in this taxon, and may even regulate translation rates per se via effects on certain ribosomal proteins. Examples of functions of the highly transcribed genes in T. castaneum that have elevated use of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status [non-optimal codons with abundant matching tRNA genes (=4)] While these codons are by definition typically uncommon in highly transcribed genes (Table 1), the subset of genes with elevated use of these codons, RSCU >1.5, were identified and are shown above. These genes are candidates for translational upregulation due to the elevated use of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status.Examples of functions of the highly transcribed genes in T. castaneum that have elevated use of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status [non-optimal codons with abundant matching tRNA genes (=4)] While these codons are by definition typically uncommon in highly transcribed genes (Table 1), the subset of genes with elevated use of these codons, RSCU >1.5, were identified and are shown above. These genes are candidates for translational upregulation due to the elevated use of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status.In terms of Val, those genes with high expression (top 5% in the genome) very rarely used the identified primary non-optimal codon GTA. In fact, only 5.1% of the 822 highly transcribed genes had GTA RSCU values >1.5, an extraordinarily low frequency. Those that did exhibit RSCU values >1.5 included genes involved in cytoskeleton functions and actin synthesis, such as Cofilin/actin-depolymerizing factor homologue-like protein and profilin, as well as a p53-related cell death protein, and a number of uncharacterized proteins (Table 2). For Arg, which has six synonymous codons, genes with RSCU values >1.5 for the non-optimal codon CGA included genes involved in olfactory signalling and with cytoskeleton roles (Table 2). It is particularly noteworthy that unlike the genes with elevated RSCU for GGC (Gly), which included abundant ribosomal protein genes, no ribosomal protein genes were among those with elevated frequency of GTA in Val or CGA for Arg. Thus, the ribosomal proteins in particular appear to be strongly connected to the usage of the non-optimal GGC Gly codon, and thus we speculate that this codon may be particularly essential to their regulation.As mentioned above, prior data have suggested that non-optimal codons, when combined with low tRNA abundance, can play important regulatory roles by preventing the jamming of multiple ribosomes during initiation of translation, or slowing translation elongation and facilitating precise protein folding.7,9,34,38,79 The present study, however, shows an additional, and much different, plausible effect of non-optimal codons in T. castaneum. Specifically, we show that the use of non-optimal codons with abundant tRNA genes (Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs) is tightly linked to predicted gene functionality (Table 2), and thus these codons may be likely to contribute to the preferential translation of mRNAs of specific types of genes. This notion agrees with recent experimental data in yeast suggesting that non-optimal or rare codons in stress genes promote the preferential translation of their mRNA in cells in response to stress-induced changes in tRNA pools.43 Thus, this comprises a potential mechanism for preferential translation of specific mRNAs. Herein, however, given that abundant tRNA gene copies are available in the genome for codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status (and thus tRNAs should be consistently abundant in cells), we speculate that the use of these non-optimal codons in certain ribosomal protein and stress genes (Table 2) likely acts as a mechanism to ensure their preferential translation among the various mRNAs within cells at an organism-wide level, perhaps independent of environmental or tissue-specific fluctuations in tRNA levels.Collectively, our data on codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status add to the growing support for a mechanism wherein non-optimal or rare codons, combined with elevated tRNA abundances, significantly shape translational regulation in eukaryotes.33,43,44,46 Further study in T. castaneum, possibly including assessments of protein abundance of genes with elevated usage of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status and with high usage of non-optimal codons with rare tRNA genes, will help unravel the relationships between non-optimal codon usage and translation. In addition, in vivo quantification of the tRNA populations in diverse tissue types in this beetle species,36,38,39,43,76 will help affirm whether these codons consistently exhibit high tRNA abundances, which could promote their preferential translation at an organism-wide level.3.5. T. castaneum codon usage bias in contextSelection(s) on optimal codons with abundant tRNAs (defined here for those codons with Opt-codon<U+2191>tRNA status, and typically denoted as under translational selection), may be influenced by factors such as effective population size (Ne) and genome size. In previous studies, smaller Ne (or NeS~1; and/or shorter generation times)84,85 or larger genomes in eukaryotes have been linked to reduced selection pressures on codon use.86 For example, using a statistic aimed to quantify an organism’s genome-wide selection on codon usage (using predicted selection pressures per codon and tRNAs; see also73) to compare among species, it was reported that strong selection pressures on codon use occurs for some bacteria such as E. coli [which also have highly skewed RSCU values (>2) for some of its codons87], with intermediate pressure in D. melanogaster and weak or absent pressure in humans. The authors of that study suggested that this pattern was related to their (respectively increasing) genome sizes.86 In this context, the overall translational selection pressures on optimal codon in T. castaneum (Table 1) may be expected to be moderate, and similar to those of its fellow insect D. melanogaster (genome sizes of 160 and 175 MB, respectively).52,88 However, such between-taxon differences on selected codon bias could also reflect weaker pressure in taxa with smaller effective population sizes, which decrease, respectively, in bacteria, insects, and humans.84 Nonetheless, our present study is largely focussed on the dynamics of the most highly transcribed (top 5%) genes in the genome in T. castaneum (rather than all genes; Table 1), and includes analyses not only of the translational selection on optimal codons per se (Opt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status), but also putative selection favouring roles of wobble and non-optimal codons (Opt-codonwobble and Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status) and their relationships to tRNAs in shaping translational processes in this taxon. While our data suggest selection has been a factor in shaping the frequency of each of these types of codons in highly transcribed genes in T. castaneum, further similar studies in more multicellular organisms, including additional Tribolium species, will ascertain the breadth of such patterns across diverse metazoans.3.6. Comparison of present optimal codon list to a prior reportOn a final note, it is worthwhile mentioning here that the optimal codon list we present in Table 1 differs from that previously reported in T. castaneum.18 The previous report used a correlation method to determine optimal codons, and a comparison of the present primary optimal codon list in Table 1 (for the whole organism analyses) to those earlier findings is shown in Supplementary Table S2. We found that only 9 of the 18 primary optimal codons identified herein, were also identified as optimal by the previous study under the correlation method,18 even when we used very loose criteria for defining a match to that prior assessment (i.e. considering all optimal codons that were defined at any level under the correlation method, regardless of whether they were the primary, secondary, or tertiary optimal codon,18 as a match to our primary optimal codon). It has been previously argued that the use of a correlation approach can often yield a misleading list of optimal codons.58 Further, the R values observed for the codons defined as optimal using the prior correlation method were typically <0.1 (the highest value was 0.237, Supplementary Table S2).18 A range of such low values, even when statistically significant, is sometimes considered a very weak or absent correlation (R < 0.3),71,72 and thus may not be conducive to revealing codons most often used in highly transcribed genes, as was the goal here. Moreover, we found that increased gene expression level (organism-wide expression) was not positively connected to the Fop when using the optimal codons (primary optimal codon defined as strongest correlation) identified under the prior correlation method.18 Rather, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, we found only mild variation in Fop among expression classes, and Fop was reduced in low and high expressed genes as compared with moderately expressed (Ranked ANOVA and Dunn’s P < 0.05), trends inconsistent with a persistent connection between Fop and expression level. However, we did find a strong connection between expression level and Fop using the optimal codons identified herein (Table 1, Fig. 1A). The method of employing <U+0394>RSCU between high and low expressed genes has repeatedly been shown effective for specifically revealing the optimal codons, defined as those preferentially used in the most highly transcribed genes in the genome,14,15,17,21,24,58 as was the present objective. Thus, the optimal codons defined herein are those most often used in highly transcribed genes, and were used for all our analyses (Table 1).4. ConclusionsThe present study has revealed the complex dynamics of codon usage in the multicellular beetle model system T. castaneum. We found that the majority of optimal codons in this animal model are shared at the organism-wide level and match tRNA with abundant gene copies, supporting the presence of species-wide translational selection for efficient and/or accurate translation. However, we also showed that a non-negligible subset of optimal codons varied among the four tissue types, suggesting a likelihood of tissue- and sex-specific tRNA populations, and thus localized translational selection. Based on codon optimality status and tRNA gene copies, we propose two hypotheses. The first hypothesis suggests that the usage of codons with Opt-codonwobble status in highly transcribed genes in this beetle has evolved as a mechanism that slows translation, which could increase precision of translation and/or protein folding. The second hypothesis proposes that usage of codons with Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status is as a mechanism that promotes high translation of mRNA of genes with specific cellular functions, which we show here to include stress-response and ribosomal protein genes.Further study in T. castaneum, including assessments of cellular protein levels of genes using codons with Opt-codonwobble and Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status in germ line and somatic tissues, will help further unravel their potential roles in translation regulation. In addition, in vivo quantification of the tRNA populations in various tissue types and under stressful conditions in this beetle, as this methodology improves,36,38,39,43,76,77 will provide additional valuable insights into tRNA population stability and variation between tissues.Our data suggest that the frequency of specific codons in T. castaneum obligately requiring wobble tRNA, similar to those non-optimal codons with few tRNAs, may be linked to translational slowing or protein-folding functions in highly transcribed genes. Future follow-up studies should assess whether such codons cluster or show original use patterns at or near protein (folding) structural elements, which some research suggests may occur in certain organisms,7,9,45,89–91 and/or whether those codons may effectively slow or pause translation.7,9,49 In an understudied metazoan model such as T. castaneum, the former may be achieved via comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of protein structural properties and codon use,45,90 and/or the development of a cell-free translation system allowing manipulation of codon use in mRNAs such as those from Neurospora and Drosophila,7,9 while the latter may be informed by ribosomal profiling analyses during translation.7,9,49 Population-level approaches will also be valuable to further ascertaining the selection pressures acting on codon use,85,87,92 particularly research on the mutational spectra of codons with Opt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs, Opt-codonwobble, and Nonopt-codon<U+2191>tRNAs status, to ascertain whether such codon mutations show signals of selection favouring their fixation in highly transcribed genes of T. castaneum.At present, most non-traditional multicellular organisms have not had as many protocols optimized for lab-based experimental or transgenic research of codon optimization, including rates of translation elongation, protein folding, tRNA-charging, or codon–anticodon tRNA binding, as compared with the established widely studied single-celled models or in vitro cell lines.7,28,33,50 We have shown here, however, using the species T. castaneum, that a multifaceted approach using analyses of gene expression, tRNA genes, tissue type, and gene functionality can be used to suggest how codon usage shapes translational optimization and regulation in a metazoan system.The authors thank Prof. Sue Brown from KSU for generously providing samples of T. castaneum for this study.

IntroductionDosage compensation is when the expression of sex-linked genes originating from different biological sexes is equalized.1 Although most studies have focused on dosage compensation of sex chromosomes, the dosage compensation of sets of genes in subgenome or whole genomes has been detected in some allopolyploids including Oryza sativa L.,2,Arabidopsis,3,Squalius alburnoides,4 and the hybrid of Ctenopharyngodon idellus × Megalobrama amblycephala.5 The potential mechanisms of dosage compensation include chromatin remodelling6 and miRNAs.7 Dosage compensation is described as an important contributor to heterosis, or ‘hybrid vigour’ as it is commonly known, which is defined as the superior performance of hybrids compared with either of their parents.8,9 However, its genetic basis and molecular mechanism in lower vertebrates have remained obscure.Growth heterosis is an important trait in aquaculture species. The different amounts of heterosis were observed in the two allotriploids (3n = 150, RC2 and R2C), which were obtained from backcrossing of the allotetraploid (4n = 200) of Carassius auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × Cyprinus carpio L. (<U+2642>) with their two inbred parents, respectively.10,11 The allotriploid RC2 fish [intercrossing between diploid C. carpio L.

(<U+2642>)] showed highly significant growth heterosis comparing to the allotriploid R2C fish [intercrossing between C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) and allotetraploid C. auratus red var. × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>)], suggesting the potential interaction between growth heterosis and genetic diversity, which affects various gene expression.12,13 Heterosis is related not only to changes in the global expression levels of all alleles,13 but also to interactions among multiple alleles originating from different species (also described as homoeologs).14,15 Thus, focusing on both of these factors could help us investigate the causes and effects of gene expression changes in hybrids. After the merging of divergent genomes, the novel dominant–recessive relationship between alleles was rebuilt.16 Study on the quantitative traits under incomplete dominance was complex for multiple allele control. However, a few studies have described that some trait variation and heterosis are led by the incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in maize.17 Both dosage effects and incomplete dominance could shape direction and magnitude of homoeolog expression, further contributing to various phenotypes in allopolyploid plant, including heterosis.9,18,19In our study, we performed mRNA-seq on the two allotriploids with growth heterosis as described earlier. After a series of expression analysis, we obtained the homoeolog expression levels in liver and muscle tissues in allopolyploid complex of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>). After genotype determination of the two triploids, comparative transcriptome analysis will help us understand the expression changes of one or two copies of genes originating from divergent genomes. In comparison of various growth features,10,14 the homoeolog expression changes of growth-regulated genes were used to explore the genetic basis of growth heterosis in triploid fish.2. Materials and methods2.1. AnimalsA total of 6 types of fishes were used in our experiments: diploid C. auratus red var. (R); diploid C. carpio L. (C); first generation of allodiploid (F1) originating from outcrossing of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) and C. carpio L. (<U+2642>); eighteenth generation of allotetraploid of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>) (F18); triploid fish (R2C) originating from intercrossing between female C. auratus red var. and male allotetraploid of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>); and triploid fish (RC2) originating from intercrossing between female C. carpio L. (<U+2640>) and male allotetraploid of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>). All fishes were fed in a pool with the same environment including suitable illumination, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and adequate forage. These experiments were conducted at the Engineering Center of Polyploidy Fish Breeding of the National Education Ministry, Hunan Normal University, Hunan, China, and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal work was approved by the academic committee in State Key Laboratory of Developmental Biology of Freshwater Fish (approval ID: 01/2018). Two-year-old male individuals of each genotype were collected with three biological replications. Fish were deeply anaesthetized with 100 mg/l MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) before dissection. To exclude effects of different tissues on gene expression, all liver and muscle tissue samples were excised carefully to avoid contamination from the gut, and were used for total RNA extraction.2.2. Genotype determinationTo determine ploidy levels, a flow cytometer was used to measure the DNA content of erythrocytes from diploid and triploid individuals. Chromosomal preparations were made from peripheral blood cell cultures of 15-month-old fishes. Blood (0.2 ml) was collected using a syringe soaked with 0.1% sodium heparin, cultured in nutrient solution at 25.5°C and 5% CO2 for 68–72 h, and then colchicine was added 3.5 h before harvest. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, followed by hypotonic treatment with 0.075 M KCl at 26°C for 25–30 min, and then fixed in methanol–acetic acid (3:1, v/v) with three changes.20 The number of chromosomes was counted under a microscope.To determine the genotypes of the two triploid fish (R2C and RC2), a 9,468 bp-sized DNA repeat fragment of C. auratus red var. was used as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. These analyses allowed us to characterize the chromosomes originating from C. auratus red var.11 The FISH probe was produced and labelled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (ROCHE, Mannheim, Germany) of purified PCR products. A total of 150 metaphase chromosome spreads from 10 individuals were examined under an inverted microscope (CW4000, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a confocal imaging system (LCS SP2, Leica). Captured images were coloured and superimposed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 software.2.3. mRNA-seq sequencing, alignments, and differential global expression analysisThe samples used to produce the mRNA-seq libraries were stored in RNALater (AM7021, Ambion Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After DNase treatment, total RNA (~2 µg) was used to construct mRNA-seq libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each type of fish, an mRNA-seq library was constructed with three biological replicates with paired ends (2 × 150 bp) using Illumina HiSeq × Ten (Illumina, Sad Diego, CA, USA). For the F1, F18, and their parents, we downloaded mRNA-seq data for liver tissue from the NCBI database (accession numbers: SRX668436, SRX175397, SRX668453, SRX177691, SRX671568, SRX671569, SRX668467, and SRX161099).The initial quality control of Illumina reads was performed with FastQC software,21 and adapters were trimmed using Trimmomatic software.22 The mRNA-seq reads of C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L. were mapped to genome sequences of C. auratus red var. (NCBI accession numbers: PRJNA487739 and PRJNA481500) and C. carpio L.,23 respectively. Gene annotations were obtained by BLASTX searches of the NCBI, gene ontology, and Swiss-Prot databases. Because of the lack of a reference genome, mRNA-seq reads for F1 and F18, R2C, and RC2 were mapped to combined genome sequences of C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L. Read mapping was conducted using STAR software with default options. Read counts of C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L. for orthologous genes were summarized for each gene pair. Normalization, estimation of expression levels, and designation as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using the edgeR package in Bioconductor.24 The DEGs between the two genotypes were detected by edgeR using threshold of |log2 fold change| > 1% and 5% false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) with three biological replicates.2.4. Identification of species-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in orthologsOrthologous gene alignments between C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L. were obtained from all-against-all reciprocal BLASTP (v 2.2.26) comparisons with the parameters of ‘-e 10-5 –F –v 1 –m 8’ based on protein sequences. Unannotated transcripts and coding sequences shorter than 300 bp were discarded. In total, orthologous gene pairs were selected from the above best scoring match and filtering.To investigate the expression level of parent-of-origin genes (homoeolog expression), the LASTZ pairwise alignment tool (v 1.02.00)25 with default parameters was used to obtain the corresponding loci for orthologous gene pairs between C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L. The insertion–deletion polymorphisms loci were discarded, and only aligned loci with best scoring matches were used for further analyses. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were collected using SNP Calling pipeline with GATK (v 3.8) based on the results of parent transcriptome mapping to their respective genomes as described earlier.26 According to the comparison of SNPs and other loci in orthologous gene pairs between C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L., we identified heterozygous and homozygous loci with species-specific SNPs as used elsewhere.27,28 To remove the negative effects of sequencing and mapping, the screening of species-specific SNPs was checked for consistency in three biological replicates. Locus possessing read counts (=1) were retained for all accessions and biological replicates in each comparison.2.5. Detection of homoeolog expression levels in hybridsTo explore homoeolog expression in hybrids, the hybrid mapping results (bam files) of the transcriptome as described earlier were used in the following analyses. The mapping files for each hybrid were divided into two categories based on the two parental genomes. The R-/C-homoeolog reads in hybrids were calculated using in-house perl scripts, based on corresponding R-/C-species-specific SNPs in their corresponding mapping files. Gene expression levels in the parents were also determined based on the respective reference genome related to species-specific SNPs. To remove the negative effects of mutation sites in hybrids with different biological replicates, if the mapping reads of the species-specific SNP did not comply with the threshold of mean ± 2 S.D. in the three biological replicates, the abnormal value was discarded when estimating the R- and C-homoeolog expression level. Then, the sum counts of R- and C-homoeologs of each gene were normalized based on the ratio of the number of mapped reads for each gene to the total number of mapped reads for the entire genome.29 The sum of R-/C-homoeolog reads in all species-specific SNPs of each gene were used to assess the R-/C-homoeolog expression levels. The average deviation (AD) values of R- and C-homoeolog expression were used to assess the magnitude of deviation.2.6. Homoeolog expression silencing and biasAfter confirming orthologous gene pairs between C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L., we detected the extent of homoeolog silencing in liver and muscle tissues of the different types of fish. The following thresholds were set for this analysis: (i) read counts =5 in both two parents in three biological replications and (ii) R- or C-homoeologous reads in hybrid = 0 in three biological replications.To investigate the homoeolog expression bias (HEB) in hybrids, the value was set based on the formula (Ebias=log 2(EC homoeologER homoeolog))<U+2060>. The distribution of Ebias was tested using the t-test in the ‘ggpubr’ package in R. We determined another value based on the parents’ expression levels (Ein silico hybrid=log 2(Epaternal CEmaternal R))<U+2060>, which was used as the reference for the beginning of changes in homoeolog expression. We calculated another two values for R2C (Ein silico R2C=log 2(Epaternal C2×Ematernal R)) and RC2(Ein silico RC2=log 2(2×Epaternal CEmaternal R))<U+2060>, based on genotypes. Statistical analyses were performed to detect correlation coefficients between R- and C-homoeolog expression levels in the hybrids in those in their respective parents using Pearson’s test and Student’s t-test in GraphPad Prism (v 7.0) software.3. Results3.1. Determination of genotypes of two allotriploidsTo determine whether dosage compensation occurred and shaped the various expression patterns in triploid fish, the genotypes of the two triploid fish (R2C and RC2) originating from the backcrossing of allotetraploid of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>) were necessary to check (Fig. 1).30 A total of 150 chromosomes were detected by flow cytometry and microscopy in R2C and RC2. Two sets of C. auratus red var. (2n = 100) chromosomes and one set of C. carpio L. (n = 50) chromosomes were detected in R2C using FISH with a specific probe,11 while one set of C. auratus red var. (n = 50) chromosomes and two sets of C. carpio L. (2n = 100) chromosomes were detected in RC2 (Fig. 1). The results showed the two sets of homologous chromosomes in both of the two triploids. The symmetric subgenomes at the genomic level were detected in F1 and F18.11,30,31Genotypes of two cyprinids and their four types of hybrid offspring. R2C and RC2 derived from backcrossing of allotetraploid of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>). One hundred signals were detected in R2C (100 chromosomes from C. auratus red var. and other 50 from C. carpio L.). Fifty signals were detected in RC2 (50 chromosomes from C. auratus red var. and other 100 from C. carpio L.). The specific-probe of C. auratus red var. was detected using FISH.11 Color figures are available at DNARES online. Genotypes of two cyprinids and their four types of hybrid offspring.

The specific-probe of C. auratus red var. was detected using FISH.11 Color figures are available at DNARES online. 3.2. Changes of gene silencing and novel expression with genotypic changesAfter initial adapter trimming and quality filtering of the mRNA-seq results, we obtained 29.6 Gb clean data for R2C, 32.6 Gb for RC2, 17.3 Gb for C. auratus red var., and 18.5 Gb for C. carpio L. for liver tissue; and obtained 36.1 Gb clean data for R2C, 34.5 Gb for RC2, 36.7 Gb for C. auratus red var., and 33.7 Gb for C. carpio L. for muscle tissue (Supplementary Table S1). Then, 35.54 million cleaned reads (73.42%) of C. auratus red var. and 59.21 million cleaned reads (74.69%) of C. carpio L. were mapped against their respective reference genomes, and 154.04 million clean reads (72.49%) of R2C and RC2 were mapped to the combined genome sequences of C. auratus red var. and C. carpio L. by STAR.Detection of R- and C-homoeolog expression values can investigate gene silencing and novel gene expression accompanying genotypic changes in hybrids. The results both in non-orthologous genes and 16,558 orthologous genes showed similar increases in novel expression of R-/C-homoeologs (R-/C-NEGs) from F1 to F18 in the liver (Supplementary Fig. S1). There were also increases in silencing of R-/C-homoeologs (R-/C-SEGs) from F1 to F18 in the liver (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the backcrossing of F18, the increasing number of R-/C-NEGs was observed in both non-orthologous and orthologous of the liver tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1), while the decreasing number of R-/C-SEGs was detected in them.Next, we explored whether the various changes in gene silencing and novel gene expression were led by divergent effects of the two genotyping triploid fishes (R2C and RC2). Analyses of gene expression data from the liver exhibited more C-SEGs in R2C than in RC2 (non-orthologous genes: 81 vs. 19; orthologous genes: 40 vs. 2), and more R-NEGs in R2C than in RC2 (non-orthologous genes: 595 vs. 405, orthologous genes: 237 vs. 185). In contrast, there were fewer R-SEGs in R2C than in RC2 (non-orthologous genes: 105 vs. 161, orthologous genes: 37 vs. 45) and fewer C-NEGs in R2C than in RC2 (non-orthologous genes: 56 vs. 128, orthologous genes: 19 vs. 51). The similar trends were detected in the muscle tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1).3.3. Differential global expressionFocusing on extent of changes in the polymorphic expression, we analysed the global expression of both R-/C-homoeologs in the 16,558 orthologous gene pairs. The greatest number of DEGs between the inbred maternal C. auratus red var. and its progeny was in the triploids (2,091 DEGs in R2C and 2,371 DEGs in RC2) (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the greatest number of DEGs between the inbred paternal C. carpio L. and its progeny was also in the triploids (735 DEGs in R2C and 400 DEGs in RC2) (Fig. 2a). The extents of differential gene expression in R2C and RC2 were larger than ones between the inbred parents and other hybrids (F1 and F18) (Fig. 2a), revealing that cumulative effects occurred in global expression accompanied with genotypic changes. However, in the muscle, there were fewer DEGs between R2C and maternal R than between R2C and paternal C, and vs. in RC2 (Fig. 2b). These results suggested different genetic regulation between the liver and muscle. Differential gene expression analyses of global expression levels of the allopolyploid complex.

Differential homoeolog expression analysisTo detect homoeolog expression in the hybrids, a number of 533,453 species-specific SNPs were used to detect 16,558 orthologous gene pairs of the two inbred parent’s genomes using all–against–all reciprocal BLAST. We selected 4,695 orthologous gene pairs that were expressed in the liver of the two inbred parents and their hybrids. The distribution of R- and C-homoeolog expression was determined in the two inbred parents and their hybrids (Fig. 3). The expression levels of the R- and C-homoeologs differed significantly between the two inbred parents (t-test: P = 0.0086 in liver, P = 0.0461 in muscle), and also differed significantly among the hybrids with different genotypes (P < 0.0001), except in the muscle of RC2 (P = 0.072) (Fig. 3). Differences in expression levels between the all two homoeologs were found in R2C in the liver (AD = 1.87) and in the muscle (AD = 1.79). However, similar homoeolog expression levels between the two subgenomes were detected in both the liver and the muscle of RC2, despite the imbalance of the two subgenomes. Distribution of R- and C-homoeolog expression values in allopolyploid complex. (a) Homoeolog expression level in liver. (b) Homoeolog expression level in muscle.

The values of log2 fold changes of gene expression level present the values of log2 normalized read counts.The changes in R- and C-homoeolog expression levels led us to investigate the correlation between R-/C-homoeolog expression levels in the hybrids and those in their inbred parents. We calculated the coefficient of determination for homoeolog expression levels in liver tissue between hybrids and their respective parents. The highest coefficient of determination for C-homoeologs was in F1 (R2= 0.49) and that for R-homoeologs was in F18 (R2 = 0.59) (Fig. 3c). In addition, the coefficients of determination were higher for the muscle than the liver (Fig. 3c) and higher for R-homoeologs than C-homoeologs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).3.5. Determination of R incomplete dominance and dosage compensationTo explore the reasons for the differences in magnitude of R- and C-homoeolog expression levels, we set two thresholds to determine the R- and C-homoeolog expression bias (R-HEB and C-HEB, respectively). The same maternal R-HEB was detected in the liver of three fish types (ratio of R-HEB: 87.45% in F1, 73.18% in R2C, and 73.63% in RC2), while R- and C-HEB were balanced in parents based on Ein silicohybrid (Fig. 4a and Table 1). This result confirmed the existence of R incomplete dominance in this allopolyploid complex. Interestingly, although there was a 1:1 ratio of R:C chromosomes in F1 and F18, R-HEB and C-HEB differed markedly between them. We detected similar R-HEB and C-HEB in the two triploid fish, although they had different ratios of R:C chromosomes. These results further suggested that different regulation mechanisms might occur in these hybrids. However, the maternal R-HEB was high in R2C and was greater in the muscle (87.17%) than in the liver (73.18%). We detected slight paternal C-HEB in the muscle of RC2 (52.50%) (Table 1). These results further indicated that the regulation mechanisms might differ between the liver and the muscle. Effect of R incomplete dominance and dosage compensation in the allopolyploid complex.

If the value of Ebias is < -2, it is considered as R-biased.Homoeologue expression bias (HEB) was calculated on the two thresholds in hybridsIf the value of Ebias is > 0, it is considered as potential C-biased in hybrids. If the value of Ebias is < 0, it is considered as potential R-biased. If the value of Ebias is > 2, it is considered as C-biased in hybrids. If the value of Ebias is < -2, it is considered as R-biased.To explore the potential mechanisms related to changes of homoeolog expression in the triploids, we tried to calculate the unknown effect under R incomplete dominance that had been observed in F1 and F18 individuals in this allopolyploid complex. The reverse direction of the unknown effect was observed in liver of RC2 and R2C (Fig. 4b and c). After calculating the values of Ein silicoR2C and Ein silicoRC2, the dosage compensation in liver of RC2 and R2C were determined by calculating the difference between Ein silicoR2C/Ein silicoRC2 and Ein silicohybrid, relative to the expression level of parental R and C (Fig. 4b and c). Under this situation, we also tried to assess the regulation mechanism in the muscle. The same direction of HEB and a similar magnitude of expression indicated that only R incomplete dominance affected gene expression in the muscle (Fig. 4d).3.6. Expression of growth-related genes under R incomplete dominance and dosage compensationTo investigate the potential relationship between growth heterosis and R incomplete dominance/dosage compensation, we calculated the Ebias and Ein silicohybrid values for the growth-regulated genes (Supplementary Table S4). In these analyses, the two triploid fishes were clustered with each other (Fig. 5a). For investigating the relationship of gene expression and growth heterosis, the expression values of the growth-regulated genes were calculated from in silico parents to the two triploid progenies. There were high ratios of R-HEB genes (76.74% in R2C and 72.10% in RC2) among the 43 genes in the liver , and high ratios of R-HEB genes ( 91.14% in R2C and 55.70% in RC2) among the 79 genes in the muscle (Fig. 5b). Further analyses showed that the most (28 in R2C and 27 in RC2) of the 43 growth-regulated genes in the liver of the allotriploids exhibited greater R-HEB than that in their parents (Fig. 5b). Sixty-six of 79 growth-regulated genes in the muscle of R2C also had greater R-HEB than that in their parents, while only 29 of 79 genes in ones of RC2 had greater R-HEB than that in their parents (Fig. 5b).

DiscussionThe complex model of allopolyploid lineages provides abundant genotypes and phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis of them can be used to investigate the potential regulation mechanisms related to allopolyploidization.32 In recent studies, dosage compensation and incomplete dominance have emerged as important processes in the formation of qualitative and quantitative traits, including heterosis.9,33 In this study, R incomplete dominance was detected in the allotetraploid lineage including the allodiploid F1, allotetraploid F18,14 and the allotriploids R2C and R2C. We also studied dosage compensation in the two triploid genotypes (R2C and R2C) with two sets of R or C chromosomes, because integrated analyses of dosage compensation and incomplete dominance can shed light on the potential mechanisms regarding heterosis.The successful establishment of allotetraploids of C. auratus red var. (<U+2640>) × C. carpio L. (<U+2642>) provided a chance to obtain triploids showing heterosis by backcrossing breeding.11,12,31 Although the allotetraploids were considered to be a stable allotetraploid population based on chromosome number analysis,11 there was lack of genotypic data of the heterozygous gamete. Therefore, the consistent genotypes in R2C and R2C individuals supported the stable heterozygous gametes from female allotetraploid individuals (Fig. 1). Assessment of gene silencing and novel gene expression in the allodiploid F1 and allotetraploid F18 revealed increases in R-/C-NEGs and R-/C-SEGs (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that the constraint of the expression of polymorphism gradually weakened through the whole genome duplication in the hybrids. The duplication of genes, chromosomes, and whole genome could contribute to expression divergence.34,35 Then, the triploids with asymmetric subgenomes showed increased R-/C-NEGs and decreased R-/C-SEGs in the liver. This result suggested that two sets of the homologous chromosomes could inhibit silencing and promote novel expression of corresponding homoeologs based on the copy number of R-/C-homologous chromosomes. These changes will lead to the emergence of dominance of partial homoeologs and contribute to heterosis.2 Global expression changes also indicated that constraints of gene expression in the inbred parents gradually weakened as a result of genotypic changes in hybrids (Fig. 2). Moreover, the most DEGs were detected in triploids, suggesting that the asymmetric subgenomes could rapidly and greatly speeded up this process, which may help us understand of the emergence of heterosis (Fig. 2).Analyses of the magnitude of gene expression in the four hybrids (F1, F18, R2C, and RC2) exhibited that the greatest HEB was in the allotriploids R2C (AD = 1.87 in the liver and AD = 1.79 in the muscle) (Fig. 3). This phenomenon revealed that the imbalance of the two homoeologs at the genomic level might contribute to greater HEB, although smallest HEB was found in RC2 (Fig. 3). Analyses of homoeolog expression between inbred parents and hybrids revealed higher coefficients of determination for R-homoeologs than for C-homoeologs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), indicating that the R genome plays the dominant role in these hybrid fish. Therefore, evolution could be occurring rapidly with respect to C-homoeolog sequences and expression. Based on the in silico values of Ein silicohybrid, Ein silicoR2C, and Ein silicoRC2, we determined the direct effects and the magnitude of the regulation mechanisms. Both dosage compensation and the R incomplete dominance effects were detected in the liver of R2C and RC2. The different directions of HEB led by dosage compensation and R incomplete dominance in the liver of R2C were partly counteracted by R-HEB. Meanwhile, the same direction of HEB led by dosage compensation and R incomplete dominance together shaped the increased trend of R-HEB in the liver of RC2 (Fig. 4). Only R incomplete dominance was detected as a regulation mechanism in the muscle of the two triploids. This may be related to epigenetic regulation such as miRNAs and RNA-directed DNA methylation in the allopolyploids.36 In addition, the differences in the magnitude of expression between the liver and muscle may relate to mosaic dominance (Fig. 3 and Table 1).37 Further research using more genotypes is required to explore this possibility.Both R incomplete dominance and the dosage compensation shaped mRNA expression in these triploids. These effects made the changes in mRNA expression at global and homoeolog levels more complex, which made it difficult to understand the mechanism of regulation of biological traits in the triploids. The phenomenon of growth heterosis in these fishes is well known but still poorly understood.10 Focussing on growth-regulated genes, comparisons between the two inbred parents and their triploid offspring at the global expression level revealed 43 genes of interest in the liver and 79 in the muscle. The R incomplete dominance of growth-regulated genes, which is related to differences in growth vigour between the two inbred parents, may contribute to growth heterosis (Fig. 5). In addition, the magnitude of R-HEB in the 79 growth-regulated genes of RC2 muscle (55.70%) was slighter than that in R2C (91.14%) (Fig. 5b), while individuals of RC2 exhibited more rapid growth than R2C. These results suggested that the appropriate balance of R-/C-HEB in the growth-regulated genes could effectively contribute to the more obvious growth heterosis in the two triploids. However, the further testing is needed to validate it. A similar phenomenon has been described in rice,2,38 tomato,39 and maize.18 Although few studies have focussed on the relationship between R incomplete dominance and heterosis in animals,40 there are some reports on this relationship in salmonids41 and in an allotetraploid of goldfish × common carp.14 Although dosage compensation could be related to heterosis,5,9 our results suggested that R incomplete dominance contributes to heterosis in the muscle of triploid fishes.Accession numbersAll short-read RNA-seq data have been deposited in the Short Read Archive under the following accession numbers: SRS4475349, SRS4475350, SRS4475351, SRS4475352, SRS4475353, and SRS4475354.FundingThis research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31702334, 31730098, and 31430088), the Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2018NK2072), the Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System (Grant No. CARS-45), the Key Research and Development Project of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2016NK2128), the Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2018NK2072), Hunan Provincial Natural Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. 2017NK1031), and the Cooperative Innovation Center of Engineering and New Products for Developmental Biology of Hunan Province (Grant No. 20134486).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"
