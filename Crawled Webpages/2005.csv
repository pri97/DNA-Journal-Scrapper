However, data from microarray experiments are well known to contain biases resulting from the experimental protocols. Therefore, in order to elucidate biological knowledge from the data, systematic biases arising from their protocols must be removed prior to any data analysis. To remove these biases, many normalization methods are used by researchers. However, not all biases are eliminated from the microarray data because not all types of errors from experimental protocols are known. In this paper, we report an effective way of removing various types of biases by treating each microarray dataset independently to detect biases present in the dataset. After the biases contained in each dataset were identified, a combination of normalization methods specifically made for each dataset was applied to remove biases one at a time.","Microarrays are often used to identify target genes that trigger specific diseases, to elucidate the mechanisms of drug effects, and to check SNPs.

Evidence is accumulating to suggest that the WRKY proteins play significant roles in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in development. In this research, we identified 102 putative WRKY genes from the rice genome and compared them with those from Arabidopsis . The WRKY genes from rice and Arabidopsis were divided into three groups with several subgroups on the basis of phylogenies and the basic structure of the WRKY domains (WDs). The phylogenetic trees generated from the WDs and the genes indicate that the WRKY gene family arose during evolution through duplication and that the dramatic amplification of rice WRKY genes in group III is due to tandem and segmental gene duplication compared with those of Arabidopsis. The result suggests that some of the rice WRKY genes in group III are evolutionarily more active than those in Arabidopsis , and may have specific roles in monocotyledonous plants. Further, it was possible to identify the presence of WRKY -like genes in protists ( Giardia lamblia and Dictyostelium discoideum ) and green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through database research, demonstrating the ancient origin of the gene family. The results obtained by alignments of the WDs from different species and other analysis imply that domain gain and loss is a divergent force for expansion of the WRKY gene family, and that a rapid amplification of the WRKY genes predate the divergence of monocots and dicots. On the basis of these results, we believe that genes encoding a single WD may have been derived from the C-terminal WD of the genes harboring two WDs. The conserved intron splicing positions in the WDs of higher plants offer clues about WRKY gene evolution, annotation, and classification.

Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analyses identified three molecules, ubiquitin D (Ub-D), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 12a (TNFRsf12a), and transmembrane 4 superfamily 4 (Tm4sf4), which were predominantly distributed throughout FAE, but were expressed little, if at all, in IECs. By contrast, transcripts of secretory granule neuroendocrine protein 1 (Sgne-1) were scattered in FAE, and were co-localized with Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1)-positive cells. This clearly suggests that expression of Sgne-1 in the gut is specific to M cells. Such a unique pattern of gene expression distinguishes FAE and M cells from IECs, and may reflect their cellular phenotype(s) associated with specific functional features. "

IntroductionMagnetic bacteria contribute to the global iron cycle by acquiring iron and converting it into magnetite (Fe3O4)1 or greigite (Fe3S4),2 which accumulates in intracellular structures known as magnetosomes. Biominerals possess highly ordered, elaborate morphologies since many biological factors strictly control the nucleation and the assembly of single crystals into complex structures.3 The most significant physical feature of a bacterial magnetic particle is its magnetic properties. Each magnetic nanoparticle synthesized by magnetic bacteria possesses a magnetic dipole moment with a single magnetic domain.4 The magnetite crystal growth and magnetic anisotropy energy must be strictly controlled by biological factors in magnetic bacteria. Contrary to artificial magnetic particles, magnetosomes can be easily dispersed in aqueous solutions because of their enclosing membrane.5 Therefore, magnetosomes have vast potential for various technological applications, and the molecular mechanism of their formation is of particular interest. Magnetic particles from Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 have been utilized as immunoassay platforms for various environmental pollutants including endocrine disruptors,6–9 as a means of recovering mRNA10 and DNA11,12 and as a carrier for DNA13 in our previous reports. A variety of functional proteins, such as enzymes and antibodies, can be displayed on the bacterial magnetic particles through recombination in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.7,14,15 Clarification of magnetite biomineralization pathways would contribute to further biotechnological application studies in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 and the potential of this material is growing and will be applicable to broad research areas. In this paper, the entire genome of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 was sequenced, annotated and analyzed.2. Materials and Methods2.1 Construction, isolation and sequencing of small-insert and large-insert librariesMagnetospirillum sp. AMB-1, isolated from fresh water in Tokyo, Japan,16 is available from ATCCATCC #700264. Genomic DNA of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 was isolated according to a standard protocol.17 Isolated DNA from Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 was sequenced using a conventional whole genome shotgun strategy.18 Briefly, random 2-kb DNA fragments were isolated after mechanical shearing. These gel-extracted fragments were concentrated, end-repaired and cloned into pUC18 at the SmaI site. Double-ended plasmid sequencing reactions were performed using DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Americium Bioscience), and sequencing ladders were resolved on MegaBACE1000 and MegaBACE4000 (Amasham Bioscience) automated DNA sequencers. One round (115 200 reads) of small-insert library sequencing generated roughly a 10-fold redundancy.A large-insert (∼15 kb) Charomid library was also constructed by MboI partial digestion of genomic DNA followed by cloning into the Charomid9-28 vector19 at the BamHI site. The Charomids provided a minimal scaffold to order and orient sequences across assembly gaps.2.2 Sequence assembly and gap closureSequence data were converted to ESD data with Cimarron 1.53 Slim Phredify and Cimarron 3.12 Slim Phredify present on the automated DNA sequencer. Data were processed with Phred for base calling, and data quality was assessed before assembly using CAP4 (Paracel, Pasadena, CA, USA). Gaps were closed by primer walking on gap-spanning library clones (identified using linking information from forward and reverse reads). Alternatively, remaining physical gaps were closed by shotgun sequencing of PCR products using primers designed from terminal sequences of scaffolds arranged in order.2.3 Sequence analysis and annotationGene modeling was performed using XanaGen (Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan) software. The results were compiled, and searches of the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) for proteins and GenBank's non-redundant database were compared. Gene models that overlapped by >10% of their length were flagged, giving preference to genes with a BLAST match. The revised gene/protein set was searched against the XanaGenome (incorporating COGs, SWISS-PROT, PROSITE, PRINTS and Pfam), KEGG GENES and TC-DB (Author Webpage). From these results, categorizations were developed using the COGs hierarchies. Initial criteria for automated functional assignment required >80% of the length of the match for BLASTP alignments with an E value < 1 × 10−1. All completed and draft genome sequences (accession numbers in Supplementary Table 1 is available at Author Webpage) were reannotated according to this manner as well.2.4 Nucleotide sequence accession numberThe sequence of the complete genome of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 is available under DDBJ accession number AP007255.2.5 Analysis of transposon mutant libraryMutants were generated by using Tn5 mini-transposon.20 The target sequence of mini-Tn5 in the genome was 5′-GGC CAG GGC-3′. The DNA sequences flanking the transposon-interrupted region were obtained by inverse PCR20 using primers (R): 5′-ACA CTG ATG AAT GTT CCG TTG-3′ and (F): 5′-ACC TGC AGG CAT GCA AGC TTC-3′. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the vector pGEM-T-easy (pGEM-T-easy Vector System, PROMEGA, WI, USA) and sequenced. The sequences were then aligned against the whole genome database of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.2.6 Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequenceMagnetosome membranes were dissolved in solubilizing buffer (40 mM Tris base, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea and 4% CHAPS). Magnetosome membrane proteins were separated in an immobilized dry strip gel (pH 3–10; 130 mm) using IPGphore (Amersham Bioscience). After rehydration at 20°C for 12 h, the strips were run with a previously described program.21 The strips were subjected to 2D-electrophoresis on a homogeneous SDS–polyacrylamide gel (12.5%). After gel electrophoresis, the gel was electroblotted onto PDVF membrane, Immobilon™-PSQ (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R 250 and visible protein spots were excised. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation using a PPSQ-1 amino acid sequencing system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Resulting sequences were aligned against the whole genome database of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.3. Results and Discussion3.1 General features of the genome of Magnetospirillum sp. strain AMB-1The genome of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 consists of a single circular chromosome of 4967148 bp. Table 1 shows the general features of the genome. The physical map is shown in Figure 1. The GC content of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 genome is 65.1%. The GC skew analysis indicated two equal replichores containing five spikes (Fig. 1, the third circle). Several genes encoding bacteriophage core protein, Mu-like protein and several transposases were found in Spike 4. The GC content (Fig. 1, the fourth circle) further suggests horizontal gene transfer (HGT) because regions with below average GC content correspond to insertion sequence (IS) elements (Fig. 1, the fifth circle) or phage regions.Circular representation of the 4967148-bp genome of Magnetospirillum sp.

AMB-1 genome.*COG, Clusters of orthologous groups of proteins.3.2 Repeat sequencesThe genome contains 33 ISs, which consist of four multicopy and seven single-copy elements. IS elements are intensively localized in three specific regions of the genome (Fig. 1, the fifth circle, positions nt 429860–444817; nt 691208–692355; and nt 3526739–3608663). The IS-concentrated regions have a lower GC content than the average of the whole genome, suggestive of gene transfer from other bacteria or phage. The inversions of GC content, or spikes, are observed mainly in IS insertion positions.There are nine regions that encode phage-related proteins, two of which lack a capsid gene. The GC content of these regions was as low as that of IS elements. Twenty-three proteins encoded within these regions were identified as integrase XerC or functional homologs. XerC is known to promote several DNA deletion reactions. Interestingly, one XerC homolog (amb0926) is located 2 kb and 102 kb upstream (positions nt 997403–998535 and nt 1095895–1097027, respectively) of two identical 1132-bp sequences. Both 1132-bp repetitive sequences include truncated incomplete IS elements. The 100-kb region between the two repetitive sequences encodes magnetosome-specific proteins (see below). It is likely that this genomic island would be deleted via the XerC integrase and the two 1132-bp direct repeat, not via an IS element.An 80-kb cluster encoding magnetosome-specific proteins, such as Mms6 and mamAB, was deficient in a spontaneous non-magnetic mutant of M. gryphyswaldens MSR-1.22 Schubbe et al. determined that 35 kb of the sequence of this 80-kb cluster contains one of a pair of IS 66 elements and suggested that the region was removed because of IS element.22 We obtained spontaneous non-magnetic mutant lacking the 100-kb region. The complete sequence in this study can explain that integrase recognized the 1132-bp direct repeats and deleted the DNA segment between the two sites.3.3 Disrupted genes by transposon mutagenesis in non-magnetic mutantsTo date, genome sequence analyses have tended toward prediction only. To annotate genes with high reliability, the analysis was performed with 1 × 10−1 of E-value in this study and half of the total genes were not annotated. Through usual analysis, only annotated genes would be subject to prediction. Transposon (Tn) mutagenesis can spotlight those of unknown genes function for magnetosome formation. An H+/Fe(II) antiporter, magA, was isolated from a magnetosome depleted Tn5 mutant.23 Isolation and characterization of the genes that mediate magnetite formation in bacteria are prerequisites for determining the mechanisms of magnetic particle biosynthesis. To identify specific genes involved in magnetite synthesis, transposon mutagenesis was conducted in strain AMB-1.20 Of 5762 Tn mutants, 69 were found to be defective for magnetosomes. The list of mutants and disrupted genes is shown in Table 2. Mapping results (Fig. 1, seventh circle) suggest that the genes required for magnetosome formation are distributed throughout the genome. Based on the COG database, protein functions encoded by disrupted genes were categorized as signal transduction (six mutants), energy production and conversion (four mutants), cell envelope biogenesis and outer membrane (three mutants) or cell motility and secretion (three mutants). However, unknown genes or genes of unknown function were disrupted in most mutants. Therefore, these genes should be focused among 2752 unknown genes. Interestingly, amb2554 (acetate kinase), amb2765 (ABC-type transport system) and amb3450 (signal transduction histidine kinase) were disrupted individually in three mutants. Moreover, among 205 genes categorized as having signal transduction functions (Table 1), amb0759 (two mutants), amb2660 (two mutants) and amb3450 (three mutants) genes were disrupted in two or three mutants. Therefore, these genes are likely to be magnetosome-related signal transduction genes.Disrupted genes by Transposon mutagenesis in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.Disrupted genes by Transposon mutagenesis in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.3.4 Magnetosome membrane proteinsMagnetosome membrane proteins were identified because a number of proteins expressed in situ were expected to play a direct role in magnetite formation. Protein fractions prepared from magnetosome membranes were separated by 2D-electrophoresis and >100 protein spots were analyzed by amino acid sequencing. Based on the protein database of Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1, the genes and annotations were identified from determined sequences. Table 3 provides a list of these genes, and Figure 1 indicates the distribution of magnetosome membrane (MM) proteins throughout the entire genome.List of the proteins and coding genes expressed on the magnetosome membrane.List of the proteins and coding genes expressed on the magnetosome membrane.To date, eight proteins specific to the magnetosome membrane in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 have been identified and reported.21,24–27 A 24-kDa protein, designated Mms2424,25 [corresponding to MamA in (26)], and four proteins tightly bound to the magnetite crystal, designated Mms5, Mms6, Mms7 and Mms13,21 were encoded within the 100-kb region between the two repetitive sequences. Other magnetosome-specific proteins, such as MpsA,24 a 67-kDa protein24 designated Mms67 and Mms16,27 are located at different loci.Forty-eight proteins were identified as individual magnetosome membrane proteins. Proteins related to oxidation/reduction were particularly prominent in this group, comprising ∼33% of the total. These proteins were similar to respiratory chain components. They might be a part of the respiratory electron transfer chain, because the magnetosome membrane would be derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. Otherwise, an alternative electron transfer involved in iron oxidation/reduction would exist in the magnetosome membrane. Other unknown genes were also recognized as candidate functional factors.A signal response regulator (amb3006) was identified on the magnetosome membrane in this study. This protein might receive sensor signals related to magnetotaxis originating from the interaction between magnetosomes and the magnetic field. This response regulator will be described in the following section.3.5 Iron oxidation/reductionAlthough Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, respiratory nitrate reduction allows the oxidation of a substrate under anaerobic conditions. The terminal electron acceptor may be Fe(III) via membrane-bound ferric reductase (amb3335). This enzyme is encoded in only 18 other eubacterial genomes, including microaerobic magnetic bacterium M. magnetotacticum MS-1. Specifically, ferric reductase activity has been measured in strain MS-1.28 Moreover, iron reduction was coupled with nitrate reduction in both strains.29,30 It is suggested that electron flow branching from quinone reduced iron. The membrane potential derived from electron transfer can be used in iron oxidoreduction.29 The number of oxidation/reduction proteins expressed on the magnetosome membranes is remarkable so that the genes encoding ferredoxin and cytochrome were analyzed. Strain AMB-1 possesses the most ferredoxin and related genes compared with 165 other eubacteria (Supplementary Table 2 is available at Author Webpage). Additionally, the number of cytochrome genes is comparable with that found in other bacteria containing multiple cytochrome genes among the 165 strains, with completely sequenced genomes (Supplementary Table 3 is available at Author Webpage). These enrichment genes would contribute to their membrane potential and a considerable amount of iron reduction.3.6 Regulation and signal transductionIn response to several environmental conditions, Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 alters the respiratory pathway and magnetosome formation. Therefore, it should appropriately regulate gene expression. It must also integrate its metabolism and distribute intracellular iron pools, which can be toxic to the cells. Several signaling genes were identified with relation to magnetosome formation from Tn mutant library.As shown in Table 4, Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 contains numerous regulatory and signaling genes that conserve multiple domains of bacterial signal transduction systems. Remarkably, the sensor module histidine kinase, corresponding to HisKA and HATPase, is encoded in 105 genes, 77 of which contain both histidine kinases (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 4 is available at Author Webpage). This redundancy is much higher than that of other bacteria, such as M. loti, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Caulobacter crescentus.31 Moreover, GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP domains were maintained more frequently than in typical free-living bacteria.31 The response regulator involving the GGDEF domain was characterized as a typical two-component signal transduction system like a CheY domain. Numerous bacterial signaling proteins show multidomain structures involving response domains (not only CheY-like but also GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP) with ligand-binding sensor domains (PAS and GAF). These multiple domains in the signaling proteins reflect the mechanism of signal transduction, from an N-terminal sensor domain to a C-terminal response domain, and suggest that the novel domains comprise a distinct system that provides an additional output module and a means of feedback control (Supplementary Table 4 is available at Author Webpage).31 The frequent occurrence of typical regulator receiver domains containing CheY and other modules (GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP) in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 suggests that they provide strict specificity to various environments, especially for switching between magnet/non-magnet synthesis and magnetotaxis. Alexandre et al.32 hypothesized that large numbers of chemoreceptors in M. magnetotacticum MS-1 are related to its energy taxis functions. Therefore, it would be required to monitor changes in the cellular energy genesis and to seek an environment that provides efficient energy generation. Tn-mutants led us to focus on three genes (amb0759, amb2660 and amb3450) classified in signal transduction. Histidine kinase (sensor signal) and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins are encoded in amb3450 and amb2660, respectively. The amb0759 gene encodes a conserved GGDEF protein domain. The results provided several genes among hundreds that should be analyzed, but it is still unclear where they function in the signaling cascade. Proteome analysis identified a response regulator containing a CheY-like receiver and a GGDEF domain (amb3006) that was expressed on the magnetosome membrane. This protein probably functions in magnetotaxis.33 A cell capable of magnetotaxis must be able to sense a geomagnetic field line by using a magnetosome chain, to transmit the information to flagella, and to move flagella to propel the organism in the appropriate direction.Regulatory and signaling proteins in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.Regulatory and signaling proteins in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1.3.7 ConclusionsFor the process of magnetosome formation, we hypothesized four major stages: (i) invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane and vesicle formation for the magnetosome membrane precursor, (ii) accumulation of ferrous/ferric ions in the cell and the vesicles, (iii) strictly controlled iron oxidation–reduction and (iv) magnetite crystal nucleation and morphology regulation.25 Moreover, signaling pathways are important for maintaining the balance of each process as well as protein or gene expression. The molecular mechanisms of each stage and the linkage of steps are expected to follow. Knowledge from whole genome sequence and gene repertories reveal organismal metabolism and insightful physiology.The entire sequence of the Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 genome was determined to learn the mechanism of fine and nano-sized magnet formation, which we have investigated as novel material applicable for recombination. The genes were annotated with an E value 1 × 10−1 however, almost half of the 4559 ORFs were still unknown and useless for functional prediction. Therefore, Tn mutagenesis and magnetosome proteomics were performed to find several candidates for magnetosome formation among 2269 ORFs, and the resulting seven and six genes identified through Tn mutagenesis and magnetosome proteomics, respectively. Moreover, both analyses revealed several genes that were categorized into a signal transduction class. Remarkable numbers of sensor and response domains were found in Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1 in this study, and 65 chemotaxis transducers were also reported in M. magnetotacticum MS-1.31 The magnetosome synthesis pathway in AMB-1 competes with oxygen respiration and couples with respiratory nitrate reduction whereas M. magnetotacticum MS-1 magnetosome synthesis is coupled with oxygen respiration. Therefore, each species has its own signal transduction gene sets that respond to different environmental stimuli. Although gene predictions were confined within annotated genes, the predictions were also observed in other bacteria. Perhaps, machinery to provide iron or others for magnetosome formation might be simple, but their controls must be complex and strict. Interestingly, magnetosome-related genes identified by Tn mutagenesis and proteome analysis are scattered throughout the genome, and similar genes have also been found in other bacteria. Therefore, magnetosome synthesis requires some genes encoded in the 100-kb region as well as other housekeeping genes. This genome analysis also suggests that the 100-kb region is a necessary element that is necessary but not sufficient for magnetosome formation. Magnetic bacteria are distributed over a heterogeneous group of Gram-negative bacteria with diverse morphologies and habitats. The wide diversity of these organisms suggests that their magnetic properties have no taxonomic significance. Comparative genomic approaches will reveal common factors for magnetosome formation or magnetotaxis. Unfortunately, the genome sequencing of microaerobe M. magnetotacticum MS-1 or Magnetococcus sp. MC-1 (JGI Microbial Genomics, Author Webpage) has not been completed, but the draft sequences are comparable.

IntroductionPollen allergens are specific substances, which cause hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system called allergies.1 They are proteins with molecular weights from 8 to 50 kD, exhibiting features of solubility and stability. These proteins are responsible for the IgE-mediated allergies in human. To date, more than 10 groups of pollen allergens have been reported.2 Among all groups of pollen allergens, Pollen_Ole_e_I (Ole) domain-containing proteins are the major allergens.3 On the other hand, based on the prevalence of IgE antibody recognition among grass pollen-sensitized individuals, members of two groups, groups 1 and 5, have been shown to dominate the immune response to grass pollen extract.2 The group 1 is described as Pollen_allerg_1 (Allerg1) domain-containing proteins and the group 5 allergens contain the domain Pollen_allerg_2 (Allerg2). Therefore, in this study, we will focus on these three groups of pollen allergens.Ole e 1 was the first purified allergen from Olea europaea4 and named as Ole e 1 according to the IUIS nomenclature.5 The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of 145 amino acid residues,1 similar to the polypeptide encoded by LAT52 gene from tomato and Zmc13 gene from maize pollens.3 The Ole domain contains six conserved cysteines which may be involved in disulfide bonds (Author Webpage).1 The domain also contains the consensus sequences E/Q/T-G-X-V-Y-C-D-T/N/P-C-R (X, any residues) (Author Webpage). Some of Ole-containing proteins are proline-rich, encoding extensin-like proteins.6 To date, ten Ole domain-containing genes have been isolated and characterized from the olive pollens.7 However, little is known about Ole-containing proteins in rice and Arabidopsis.Allerg1-containing genes were considered to encode grass group 1 pollen allergens that caused human allergy responses.8 All group 1 allergens examined to date have an N-glycosylation site at amino acid position 9 and carry glycans corresponding to 4–5% of their molecular weight.2 They contain seven conserved cysteine residues, located mainly in the N-terminal half of the proteins (Author Webpage).2 Now Allerg1-containing genes from at least 10 species have been cloned including one gene from rice.2,9 However, no report showed genome-wide identification in rice.The BLAST search of GenBank using the first expansin cDNA sequence revealed the similarity of the sequences to that encoding the group 1 allergens.8 Subsequently, Cosgrove et al.10 reported that the group 1 allergen from maize (Zea mays) pollens, called Zea m 1, has wall-loosening activity characteristic of expansins and proposed that these proteins loosen the cell walls of the stigma and style to aid pollen tube penetration. Grass group 1 pollen allergens are now recognized as a subgroup of β-expansins.11 Today, expansins are regarded as proteins that mediate cell wall extension in plants including two families, named α and β expansins (Author Webpage).8,10–12 Although group 1 allergens were first identified in pollens, β-expansin genes are expressed more widely during the growth and development of vegetative tissues.13–15Allergen2 domain-containing genes encoded grass pollen proteins of group 5 with ribonuclease activity (Author Webpage).16,17 The allergens in this family were identified as Lol p 5, Pha a 5, Phl p 5, Phl p 6, Phl p 11 and Poa p 9 with predicted molecular weights ranging from 28.3 to 37.8kD.18 Compared to group 1 allergens, no N-linked glycosylation has been reported to occur in this group, but they contain several hydroxylated proline residues.2,19 Alanine constitutes up to 30% of the amino acid content while the representation of methionine, cysteine, histidine and tryptophan is unusually low.2 Although this group of allergens from at least seven species have been cloned,2 little is known about this group of genes and their proteins in rice and Arabidopsis.Although the expression of some of Allerg1-containing genes was detected in pollens and other tissues, previous reports showed that Ole- and Allerg2-containing genes were pollen specific. Both Zmc13 in maize and LAT52 in tomato were Ole domain-containing genes with pollen-specific expression manner, playing an important role in pollen hydration and/or pollen germination.20,21 In rice, PS1 gene also encoded a protein with Ole domain, showing a pollen-specific expression pattern.22 In addition to this, three Allerg2-containing genes from kentucky bluegrass were also confined to pollen tissues.23 Therefore, a question raises: do all Ole- or Allerg2-containing genes show pollen-specific expression patterns?In this report, we have identified 114 pollen-allergen-like genes (referred to pollen-allergen genes hereafter for convenience) in rice genome by bioinformatics using information available in public databases, some of which might be new members of these families. We also demonstrated the applicability of the prediction programs to identify pollen-allergen genes and analyze their expression pattern by RT–PCR.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materials and their growth conditionsJaponica rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) was used for all RNA extractions. The total RNAs were extracted from the following tissues; young leaves from 3-week-old plants, mature leaves from flowering plants, young panicles from non-flowering plants, mature panicles from flowering plants, young and mature roots from 10- to 20-days-old seedlings grown on MS media at 25°C under 16 h light/8 h dark conditions.2.2. Databases search for pollen-allergen genesWe have used several ways to search and predict pollen-allergen genes. The key pollen-allergen genes were obtained from the protein families database (Pfam, Author Webpage). The representative sequences were selected for BLAST searches based on the phylogenetic analysis. The GenBank accession numbers of the amino acid sequences used for BLAST searches were as follows: CAA02039, Q03211, AAC69131, P33050, CAB78861, O49813, P13447, P19963 and AAA98492 for Ole-containing genes; BAA05476, AAF72986, AAB61710, Q41576, O81999, AAC96078, AAF17571, AAF62183, Q9FL80 and Q9LN94 for Allerg1-containing genes; AAB41585, CAA76556, JT0756, C39098, AAB35985, AAB35986 and AAB35987 for Allerg2-containing genes. The domain amino acid sequences of Ole, Allerg1 and Allerg2 were used to identify corresponding pollen-allergen genes with a high similarity in rice genome using TBLASTN and BLASTP program in RGP (Rice Genome research Program, Author Webpage), TIGR (Author Webpage), Gramene (Author Webpage), Oryzabase (Author Webpage), NCBI (Author Webpage), and DDBJ (Author Webpage) databases. All predicted pollen-allergen genes were used for similarity searches again in order to confirm predicted genes and to detect new candidates. Alternatively, databases were searched using ‘ole, allerg1 or allerg2’ as keywords to achieve more pollen-allergen genes. The databases used for this approach are as follows: RiceGAAS (Author Webpage), Oryzabase, Gramene and NCBI databases. Several rice annotation programs such as RiceHMM program (Author Webpage), RiceGAAS (Author Webpage) and the New GENSCAN Web Server at MIT (Author Webpage) were used for predicting full-length pollen-allergen coding regions and their proteins. The rice full-length cDNA database KOME (Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular biological Encyclopedia; Author Webpage)24 was used for searching full-length cDNAs of all predicted pollen-allergen genes. The comparison of coding regions between predicted cDNAs and KOME full-length cDNAs was carried out using the programs ‘BLAST 2 SEQUENCES’ in NCBI database and DNASTAR. In addition, the Arabidopsis pollen-allergen genes were obtained by searching TIGR and TAIR (Author Webpage) databases using the program BLASTP and keyword searches.2.3. Identification of motifs in the predicted pollen-allergen genesIn order to confirm the presence of conserved domains in the predicted genes and use their sequences for phylogenetic analysis, motifs in the predicted pollen-allergen genes were identified using Pfam program (Author Webpage). BLASTP in NCBI (Author Webpage) and InterPro (Author Webpage) databases were also employed to detect conserved domains.2.4. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysisPreliminary sequence manipulations were performed using DNASTAR program. The sequence alignment was generated using ClustalX (Version 1.8).25 The aligned amino acid sequences formed the basis for the phylogenetic analysis. Maximum-parsimony (MP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses were performed using the program Mac PAUP 4.0b8 (ppc) (Author Webpage). Heuristic search option with MILPARS, TBR (tree-bisection-reconnection) branch swapping, ACCTRAN (accelerated transformation) optimization, and random addition with 100 replicates was used to find the best tree. Bootstrap analysis was used to investigate tree support of MP and ML tress. Bootstrap supports (BS) of specific nodes26 were estimated with 500 replicates for ML analysis and 1000 for MP under default options as implemented in PAUP program. Nodes with BS values >70% were considered supported with 95% probability.272.5. Primer selection and RT–PCRAll primers used in this study were designed by Primer Selection in DNASTAR program and then submitted to NCBI database for BLAST search. All non-specific primers shown by the search results were eliminated instead of re-designed primers with specific binding to the corresponding genes. Thus, the results from RT–PCR analysis might represent the expression pattern of pollen-allergen genes.Total RNAs from six different tissues (young and mature leaves, panicles and roots) were used as templates. The RNAs were isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. In order to eliminate the possibility of genomic DNA contamination in PCR amplification, total RNAs were treated by RNase-free DNase. RT–PCRs were carried out using Qiagen One-Step RT–PCR kit. PCR amplification were performed in 25 µl reaction mixtures with 200 ng of total RNA, 400 µM of each dNTPs, 0.6 µM of each primer, 5 µl of Q solution, 4 units of RNase inhibitor and 5 µl of buffer provided by the supplier. The reactions were performed in PTC-100 thermo-cyclers. The program used for RT–PCR was 50°C for 30 min and 95°C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 53–65°C for 1 min (depending on the Tm value of primers) and 72°C for 1 min; followed by a 10 min extension step at 72°C and 10°C forever to terminate.3. Results3.1. Identification of pollen-allergen genes using public sequence databasesMore than 230 sequences encoding three types of pollen allergens and/or their homologs were identified by searching all public databases as described in the Materials and Methods. Some of the sequences were redundant as the sequence of a pollen allergen or its homolog overlapped between two YAC or BAC clones. Others showed no homology to three types of domains namely Ole, Allerg1 and Allerg2 by further BLASTP search. After filtering these sequences, 114 pollen-allergen genes were predicted. Among them, 45 genes were identified which encoded Ole domain-containing proteins with 350–6188 bp long in genome sequence. They were named as Oryza sativa Ole 1–45 (OsOle1–45). Other 62 predicted genes encode Allerg1 domain-containing proteins, and their genomic region ranged from 353 to 6919 bp long named as Oryza sativa Allerg1-1 to 49 (OsAllerg1-1 to 62). The remaining seven members were genes encoding Allerg2-containing proteins and were from 809 to 5164 bp long which were named as Oryza sativa Allerg1-1 to 7 (OsAllerg1-1 to 7). Supplemental Table 1a–c (Author Webpage) lists all the pollen-allergen genes predicted, their locations on rice chromosomes, BAC, YAC clones with accession numbers, genetic map positions and molecular weights of the proteins they encode. Based on this analysis, we concluded that the rice genome encodes at least 114 putative pollen-allergen genes.3.2. Phylogenetic analysisIn order to classify the rice pollen-allergen genes predicted in this study, we have constructed phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequences of the known Ole, Allerg1 and Allerg2 domains. All domain sequences were obtained by searching databases as mentioned in the Materials and Methods.Using the Pfam database (Author Webpage), 9 key Ole-containing genes were identified. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by using these key sequences and all predicted Ole domain sequences (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the tree showed that six genes (OsOle20, 23–25, 28 and 36) were grouped together with five key Ole-containing genes from other plants with accession numbers P33050, O49527, O49813, P13447 and P19963 (Fig. 1A). The OsOle12 was in the same cluster of the gene with accession number Q40793. In addition to this, we could not find any member of rice genes classified with the other three non-rice Ole-containing genes: Q07894, Q03211 and P93013. On the contrary, most of the OsOle genes also could not be clustered into any group of non-rice Ole-containing genes, indicating the prediction of new members of Ole-containing genes in rice.Phylogenetic tree and structure of exons and introns of OsOle genes.

One member from each group was selected randomly for the tree construction with 62 rice Allerg1 domains to classify into α-, β- expansin or expansin-like members (Fig. 2A). The tree analysis showed that rice Allerg1 genes could be divided into three subgroups on the basis of domain sequence similarity. The largest subgroup is classed into α-expansins, with 35 members as shown in Fig. 2A with blue shade. The second subgroup is β-expansins, containing 23 members as shown in Fig. 2A with pink shade. The smallest subgroup is expansin-like expansins including four members (Fig. 2A with yellow shade).Phylogenetic tree and structures of exons and introns of OsAllerg1 genes.

Characterization of putative homologs of pollen-allergen genes in riceThe structural analysis of exons and introns based on the prediction from RiceGAAS revealed that 33 of 45 OsOle genes consisted of two exons, six with 3–8 exons and the other six members with no intron (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, among 62 OsAllerg1 genes 20 possessed two exons, 19 had three exons and the 13 consisted of 4–6 exons and 10 had no introns (Fig. 2B). However, the structures of seven Allerg2 genes were highly variable with 1–10 exons (data not shown). Besides three pollen-allergen domains, other domains were also present in some pollen-allergen genes. Table 1 lists 18 other domains detected in Ole and Allerg1 domain-containing genes. For OsOle genes, 13 members were detected with the DUF1210 domain, which presents in proline-rich plant proteins. In OsAllerg1 genes, the domain DPBB_1 was found in 32 members of the predicted genes and other 10 members with the GRP domain detected in glycine-rich proteins.Presence of other domains in predicted Ole- and Allerg1-containing genes.Presence of other domains in predicted Ole- and Allerg1-containing genes.3.4. Chromosomal distributionIn order to analyze the chromosomal distribution of the predicted pollen-allergen sequences, we performed database searches to localize the map position of corresponding YAC or BAC clones using the data from RGP (Rice Genome Research Program) website (Author Webpage). Figure 3A shows the distribution of the OsOle1–45 genes on different chromosomes in the rice genome. All of predicted OsOle sequences were distributed within 10 chromosomes namely chromosome 1–7, 9, 10 and 12, and no homologs were located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Although 10 chromosomes had homologs, each one differed in the number of OsOle genes it contained; chromosomes 6 and 12 contained one OsOle gene each; chromosomes 2, 3, 4 and 9 contained two each; chromosomes 5 and 7 had three each; chromosome 1 had 5 and chromosome 10 had 14 OsOle genes. The OsOle1–11, 16–18 and 38–44 were located on the short arms of the rice chromosomes and the rest were located on the long arms. Moreover, OsOle23 and OsOle36 were mapped near the centromere and OsOle 26, 27 and 28 were mapped on the end of the long arms (<4 cM to the end).Chromosomal mapping of pollen-allergen genes predicted from the completed rice genome sequence.

A, Map of OsOle genes. B, Map of OsAllerg1 genes. Gene names were marked on the left side of chromosomes and genetic positions were on the right of chromosomes.Figure 3B shows the chromosomal distributions of Allerg1-containing genes. Similar to OsOle genes, all the Allerg1-containing homologs were distributed within 10 chromosomes. They were mapped on chromosome 1–7, and chromosome 8 instead of 9 in OsOle genes as well as 10 and 12, no homologs were located on chromosomes 9 and 11. Chromosomes 8 and 12 contained one homolog each; chromosome 7 had two; chromosome 5 had three and chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6 and 10 had four or more homologs each. Twenty-two genes were located on the short arms of rice chromosomes, which were OsAllerg1-1–3, 10–21, 26–30, 39 and 49, and the rest were located on the long arms. Three genes OsAllerg1–46, 47 and 52 were mapped on the long end of the long arms and seven other sequences OsAllerg1–23, 36, 37, 39 and 41–43 were mapped near the centromere.On the other hand, although only seven members of OsAllerg2 genes were detected in rice genome, they were distributed on six different chromosomes namely chromosome 1–4, 7 and 10 as shown in Supplemental Table 1c (Author Webpage). Only chromosome 4 contained two members.3.5. Comparison of predicted genes and isolated full-length cDNAsIn order to validate the gene prediction in the organization of exons and introns, we obtained predicted cDNAs sequences from public databases that are mentioned in Materials and Methods and their corresponding RIKEN full-length cDNA sequences, from KOME database.24 These two sequences were used for BLAST search using ‘BLAST 2 SEQUENCES’ to detect the differences between two cDNA coding regions. The results showed that most of predicted cDNAs exhibited the same exon and intron structure as shown in RIKEN cDNAs. However, we still found 11 pollen-allergen genes with different splicing of exon and intron between predicted and RIKEN cDNAs (Fig. 4). Among them, three from Ole-containing genes (OsOle20, OsOle28 and OsOle29), six from Allerg1-containing genes (OsAllerg1–16, 28, 33, 37, 46 and 47) and two from Allerg2 genes (OsAllerg2–3 and OsAllerg2–5). Five genes exhibited the differences only in the length of exons or introns, which were OsOle20, 28, OsAllerg1–16, 28 and 46. The other six genes showed differences not only in the length of exon and intron but also in the numbers of exon and intron. In some cases, predicted genes contained one or more exons (OsOle38, OsAllerg1–33, 37 and OsAllerg2–3); and sometimes showed lesser number of exons (OsAllerg1–47 and OsAlerg2–5) (Fig. 4).Comparison between both 11 predicted cDNAs and their RIKEN full-length cDNAs.

Expression pattern of pollen-allergen genesIn order to examine whether these predicted pollen-allergen genes are expressed in rice and to study their expression patterns, the total RNAs isolated from various tissues were subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT–PCR) analysis (Materials and Methods). To avoid contamination from genomic DNA, total RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase prior to RT–PCR. Primers were designed based on coding regions of pollen-allergen genes and are shown in Supplemental Table 2 (Author Webpage). The RT–PCR results showed that not all predicted genes were expressed in tissues tested under normal growth conditions. Thirteen (OsOle1, 2, 6, 11, 19, 22, 26, 30, 35, 36, 42, 44 and 45) of 45 OsOle genes could not be detected even if we modified the RT–PCR conditions. Among the other 32 OsOle genes, 12 members showed expression in all six tissues tested: young and mature leaves, roots and panicles with similar expression intensity (Fig. 5A). These genes were as follows: OsOle3–5, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 25, 28, 31 and 37. The other 20 genes exhibited leaf, root or panicle-specific expression pattern, among which OsOle29, 31, 33 and 34 showed high expression in the panicles but were weakly expressed in leaves and roots, and only six genes (OsOle16, 18, 32, 39, 40 and 41) were panicle-specific, might be putative pollen-specific allergen genes.RT–PCR analysis of pollen-allergen genes.

The RT–PCR results showed that 39 OsAllerg1 genes could be detected among 49 RT–PCR reactions (Fig. 5B). We could not detect any signal in the other 10 genes despite modifying RT–PCR conditions. The analysis showed that 16 among 39 OsAllerg1 genes were expressed in all tested tissues. These genes were OsAllerg1–3, 4, 6, 7, 16, 25, 26, 29, 36, 38, 42, 49, 52, 54, 58 and 61, including six members of β-expansin genes, eight α-expansins and two expansin-like genes. Only two members showed panicle-specific expression, which were α-expansin genes OsAllerg1–45 and 62. Other two α-expansin genes exhibited root-specific expression including OsAllerg1–2 and 59. The remaining 19 genes either showed difference in expression intensity or differentially expressed in one or two among six tested tissues. For example, OsAllerg1–26 showed the highest expression in mature panicles and OsAllerg1–52 showed the lowest expression in mature leaves; four genes (OsAllerg1–9, 28, 41 and 44) showed no expression only in the leaves.As for seven predicted OsAllerg2 genes, six genes showed expression. Among them, three genes (OsAllerg2-2, 3 and 5) showed expression in all tested tissues except in young roots. The OsAllerg2-1 gene exhibited no expression only in mature leaves. No expression was detected in both mature leaves and young roots, and weak expression in mature panicles for OsAllerg2–4. On the other hand, OsAllerg2–6 showed difference in expression intensity with the strongest expression in young panicles.Since eight genes showed panicle-specific expression, the total RNA samples from mature anthers were isolated and then used for RT–PCR analysis. The results showed that all panicle-specific genes were expressed in mature anthers with the highest expression for the gene OsOle18, the best candidate of pollen-specific genes (Fig. 5C).4. DiscussionStudies on pollen-specific genes would contribute to understanding the mechanism of male gametophyte development. Since both pollen-specific genes PS1 in rice and LAT52 in tomato encoded Ole domain-containing proteins,22,28 we were interested to know whether all Ole domain-containing genes were pollen specific. In order to find out, primarily, we predicted all OsOle genes by searching public databases based on whole rice genome sequences. Because the Ole domain-containing genes encoded proteins responsible for pollen allergen, we also predicted other two gene families with other two pollen-allergen domains: Allerg1 and Allerg2 in order to know whether these proteins are also pollen specific. Our data showed at least 114 genes encoding proteins belonging to three groups of pollen-allergen families in rice genome.To our knowledge, only one OsOle gene (PS1) was identified in rice genome,22 other 44 were first identified and partially characterized. In Arabidopsis genome, only 17 Ole domain-containing genes were predicted when we performed homology searches (Table 2). Ole domain-containing genes were originally characterized from tomato and maize as pollen-specific genes.20,21 Subsequently, the domain-containing proteins from olive were identified as the major allergen.3 Now 77 members have been identified from various plants (the Pfam database). However, only few genes were functionally characterized including pollen-specific genes Zmc1320 and LAT5221 as well as pistil-specific genes.6 On the other hand, seven OsAllerg2 genes were also first predicted, all of which were from the RiceGAAS annotation database and not from other databases. Despite the availability of 45 Allerg2 domain-containing sequences in the Pfam database, none of them were from rice. No homologs were found in rice genome when subjected to BLAST search using the 45 sequences, suggesting that rice Allerg2-containing genes might be different from other plants. Despite the identification of 45 Allerg2 domain-containing genes from 7 species (Pfam database), the functional and biological roles of this family is still unknown.A total of 55 Allerg1 domain-containing genes have been predicted in rice genome (Author Webpage), of which one member did not contain the Allerg1 domain. Among the remaining 54 genes, 40 have been characterized as the members of expansin family (26 α- and 14 β-expansin genes).13,29 We predicted 62 genes including the 54 genes previously identified. The additional eight predicted genes included four α-expansin genes (OsAllerg1–4, 8, 15 and 45) and four β-expansin genes (OsAllerg1–33, 36, 37 and 44). On the other hand, 38 expansin genes were reported in Arabidopsis genome.30 However, detailed analysis showed that two of them were pseudogenes and another one showed incomplete gene structure. Thus, only 35 members were identified in the genome (Table 2). Besides these, 420 members of Allerg1-containing genes have been identified based on the Pfam database. The comparative analysis suggested that the Allerg1-containing genes should be the major pollen-allergen genes in rice and Arabidopsis.Besides the three pollen-allergen domains, most of pollen-allergen genes contained other domains (Table 1), suggesting the multiple functions of pollen-allergen genes in rice. In OsOle genes, 13 contain the domain DUF1210 that presents in proline-rich plant proteins. The function of this domain is yet to be uncovered. In OsAllerg1 genes, 41 members possessed a domain named DPBB_1, whose functions were also not well understood. Another domain that was detected in 13 OsAllerg1 genes is GRP, which was found in several glycine-rich and stress-induced proteins.The analysis of phylogenetic tree indicated that rice genome had at least 16 groups of OsOle genes, half of which consisted of only one member (Fig. 1A), indicating the high diversity in rice Ole-containing genes. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that most of OsOle genes might be new members of the gene family as they were clustered into groups different from the genes from other plants. The presence of new members suggested the diversity of biological functions of rice OsOle allergen genes. On the other hand, low diversity was observed in Allerg1 domain-containing gene family as they were classified into three subgroups like other plant expansin families.12 However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the α-expansin-like subgroup was in the same group as β-expansin subgroup. Therefore, these four members might be regarded as members of β-expansin sub-family although they were identified as expansin-like genes in other studies (Author Webpage). Additionally, the member OsAllerg1–50, which was identified as a β-expansin-like gene (Author Webpage), was grouped together with β-expansin family. Therefore, the gene might be regarded as a member of β-expansin family. The results suggested that there might exist only two sub-families α and β-expansin instead of three sub-families in rice genome.Rice pollen-allergen genes were distributed into 11 of 12 chromosomes excluding chromosome 11. They were located on different positions of chromosomes. Some of them were mapped on long-arm, others on short-arm; some of them on centremere regions and others on the ends of chromosomes. However, they were not distributed randomly on chromosomes. Some of them were clustered on chromosomes. For example, 11 OsOle genes (OsOle1–11) were predicted from a 29 788 bp long fragment of BAC clone B1189A09 located on chromosome 1 (Fig. 3A). These genes shared high homology in their DNA and amino acid sequences, and were grouped together as an independent cluster in phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, some of pollen-allergen genes in a cluster exhibited same genomic DNA sequences but located on different positions. For example, both OsAllerg1–26 and 29 had same sequences but they were located on different position of BAC clone OSJNBa0009C08 as shown in Supplemental Table 1b (Author Webpage). This specific distribution and high similarity in sequences of these genes suggested that the recent evolutionary event have happened within a short DNA fragment in pollen-allergen genes. Similarly, OsOle39, 40 and 41 clustered together on the clone OSJNBa0031A07 located on chromosome 10 as shown in Supplemental Table 1a (Author Webpage). Similar distribution was also observed in OsAllerg1 genes on chromosome 3 and 10 as shown in Supplemental Table 1b (Author Webpage), indicating the unique distribution of pollen-allergen genes on rice chromosomes.Expression analysis was performed by RT–PCR. The analysis showed no expression of some pollen-allergen genes under normal growth conditions and these could be pseudogenes or stress-induced genes. In addition to this, most of pollen-allergen genes were expressed not only in panicles but also in other tissues, and thereby were not pollen-specific genes. However, our data showed six panicle-specific OsOle and two OsAllerg1 genes that were best candidates of pollen-specific genes. Further analysis showed that the eight genes were anther-specific (Fig. 5C). Since only two pollen-specific genes were isolated and characterized in rice, more genes should be identified for further understanding of the mechanism of male gametophyte development. Our data might contribute to the identification of new pollen-specific genes. As for OsAllerg1 genes, most of efforts focused on the expression analysis of non-panicle organs under various stresses and treatments such as submergence and auxin,13,31 and no data focused on the expression analysis in rice panicles. Since the expression of OsAllerg1 genes in rice reproductive organs as shown in our data, those genes might play important roles in not only vegetative but also reproductive development.It will become possible and important to identify and characterize a gene family in the whole genome by bioinformatics based on public database after the completion of whole rice genome sequences, and the release of reliable and powerful annotation system. To validate the reliability and applicability of predicted pollen-allergen genes, we collected all full-length cDNA of pollen-allergen genes from RIKEN full-length cDNA database24 and compared with all predicted coding regions. A total of 56 full-length cDNA were found to encode 56 corresponding pollen-allergen genes as shown in Supplemental Table 1a–c (Author Webpage). Among them, 23 match OsOle genes, 29 for OsAllerg1 genes and the remaining 4 for OsAllerg2 genes. Comparison analysis revealed that most of pollen-allergen genes were correctly predicted with the same exon and intron organization in encoding regions as shown in full-length cDNAs, suggesting the applicability of the prediction program to identify pollen-allergen genes. Although some of predicted genes were not correct in exon and intron organization as shown in Fig. 4, in most of cases, a researcher could obtain full-length coding region of a pollen-allergen gene by RT–PCR using primers designed from predicted sequences for further functional analysis.In conclusion, we have identified 114 pollen-allergen genes in the rice genome and classified them. Also, we have partially characterized them for their expression in major tissues, intron/exons structure and other features. This is a preliminary analysis performed with the available sequence information and the gene prediction tools to predict the rice genes. In future, more pollen allergens may be uncovered in the rice genome when better gene analysis tools are available.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary material is available online at Author WebpageSupplementary data"

IntroductionAfter completion of the human genome project, numerous genes have been predicted by bioinformatic approachs. However, library construction still serves as a critical resource of actually existing genes and a platform for comprehensive analysis of the gene functions. With this in mind, we have constructed several cDNA libraries and initiated a human cDNA project to accumulate information regarding the long protein coding sequences (CDSs) of unidentified human genes since 1994.1 We have isolated and entirely sequenced long human cDNA clones (>4 kb) and have already registered >2000 genes (KIAA genes) to the public database to date. However, the function has been identified in some genes, half of the genes are still remained to be elucidated mainly depending on their difficulty for using human materials. Therefore, we decided to collect mouse KIAA cDNAs (mKIAA) for further functional analysis in a model organism.We have previously reported the sequences of ∼1500 mKIAA cDNAs and the tissue-specific expression of ∼1700 mKIAA genes using cDNA microarray.2–6 The entire sequence of mKIAA cDNAs revealed that mKIAA (also KIAA) cDNAs have extremely long 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) sequences. Furthermore, cDNA microarray analysis elucidated that ∼30% of the genes are predominantly expressed in the brain. We thus assumed some correlations lie between the two observations. The 3′-UTR sequences are critical for determining mRNA stability, mRNA targeting and level of translation.7–13 The sequences are also known to be important for the pathogenesis of some disease through regulation of mRNA stability.14 Although molecular neuroscientists have empirically noted that mRNAs abundant in the brain have long 3′-UTR, statistical or comprehensive approaches on the correlation between the expression levels and the 3′-UTR lengths have not been performed.In this paper, we first validate the orthology of mKIAA and KIAA cDNA pairs; subsequently, we report the statistical correlation between the relative expression levels in the brain and the 3′-UTR lengths, and discuss the possible functional sequence elements in the 3′-UTRs found in mKIAA and KIAA cDNAs.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Nucleotide sequencesWe obtained mKIAA and KIAA cDNA sequences from our ROUGE (Author Webpage) and HUGE (Author Webpage) databases, respectively.2.2. Estimation of orthologyWe estimated the evolutionary relationship between KIAA and mKIAA by the following steps: (i) find chromosomal position of KIAA genes using the NCBI Map Viewer (Author Webpage);15 (ii) find the mouse chromosomal region corresponding to the human chromosomal region encoding the KIAA genes using the NCBI Map Viewer; (iii) find the chromosomal position of mKIAA using BLAST search;16 and (iv) compare the mouse chromosomal region found in (ii) with the chromosomal position of mKIAA gene found in (iii). The number of synonymous substitutions per site (dS) was estimated by Nei and Gojobori's method17 using SNAP program.18,192.3. A search for candidate elements effecting on the specific expression in brainWe extracted conserved 3′-UTR sequences between 50 mKIAA highly expressing in brain and their orthologous KIAA cDNAs. The MEME program (Author Webpage) was used to find 20–25 bp elements that appeared >50 times. The existence of newly identified sequence elements was searched with >60% nucleotide identity against the 3′-UTR sequences of 1031 mKIAA cDNAs, which were verified for the integrity of the 3′-UTR structure. The existence of the elements was also searched against 3′-UTRs of non-mKIAA genes in UTRdb (Author Webpage) entries using BLAST search. Differences of the relative expression levels in brain between mKIAA cDNAs with and without the elements were calculated by the Student's t-test. The tissue specific expression of each gene was based on the descriptions in the literature or our original data (freely available through our database).63. Results3.1. Identification of mouse KIAA-homologous cDNAsThe mouse homologs of KIAA genes were isolated from size-fractionated cDNA libraries (Table 1). Approximately 55% of KIAA cDNAs (1116 out of 2038 cDNAs) were derived from adult human brain libraries; thus, we initially subjected 23 000 end sequences of adult mouse brain library for the screening of mKIAA genes and identified nearly half of mKIAA cDNAs. The remainder was isolated from other libraries and consequently 1499 mKIAA homologs were successfully isolated and entirely sequenced. By comparing the mKIAA cDNA sequences with human sequences, we designated those 1479 mouse cDNA clones as ‘mKIAA’ and the same four-digit number corresponding to human clones. Although 20 cDNA clones were eventually found not to be orthologous to any KIAA cDNAs, these cDNAs were conventionally designated as ‘mKIAA’ and a four-digit number that has not been allocated for human KIAA genes (mKIAA3000s). The average length of the cDNA inserts was 4.6 kb and deduced gene products was 830 amino acid residues. Multiple CDSs were found in 237 mKIAA cDNAs that are longer than 50 amino acid residues and have high amino acid identity (>50%) to corresponding KIAA by FASTA analysis.20 These multiple CDSs are thought to be produced by spurious CDS splits caused by retained intron(s), alternative splicing or splicing error, reverse transcription error(s) or other cloning artifacts.2–5 We evaluated the spurious CDS splits through the sequence comparison of mouse and human KIAA cDNA pairs and the genome/cDNA structures,2–5 and we found that 144 mKIAA cDNA clones appeared to retain intron(s). Taking the assumption into consideration, alternative prediction of the deduced gene products might increase to 873 amino acid residues.The details of cDNA libraries used in this study.aThe brain library consists of ∼3 × 106 independent clones.The details of cDNA libraries used in this study.aThe brain library consists of ∼3 × 106 independent clones.3.2. Orthology between mouse and human KIAAsWe have only defined the cDNA sequences as mouse homologs of KIAA genes when they showed the highest homology against the corresponding human KIAA genes at the time of being sequenced. To support orthologous relationship of mKIAA and KIAA gene pairs, we assigned their chromosomal positions and examined whether they were derived from the common ancestral chromosomal location. We classified the positional relations of the gene pairs into the following three categories using the NCBI Map Viewer:21 (i) the 896 gene pairs located on the corresponding chromosomal regions between mouse and human; they would be judged to be orthologous; (ii) the 102 gene pairs not located on the corresponding chromosomal regions; they could not be judged to be orthologous; and (iii) the 481 gene pairs whose sequence or data on the chromosome location were not available; also, they could not be judged to be orthologous.For further verification of the orthology, we also investigated the evolutionary rate of dS estimated by the Nei and Gojobori's method.17 The rate of human/mouse orthologous pair is approximately constant, since they are diverged concurrently 80 million years ago and accumulated dS during the same period.22 Paralogous gene pairs usually show higher rate of dS than orthologous gene pairs.23 The dS of 1479 mKIAA/KIAA pairs (0.64 ± 0.22, max. = 4.86, min. = 0.01) is slightly higher but consistent with the previous study that calculated dS of orthologous gene pairs between human and mouse (0.55 ± 0.63).23 Therefore, most of the mKIAA/KIAA pairs were thought to be orthologous. We then compared the distribution of the dS values among the above-mentioned three categories based on the chromosomal positions (Fig. 1a). The distributions of dS values were quite similar, therefore, not many paralogs would be included if they exist in the gene pairs whose correspondence was not supported by the chromosomal locations. Furthermore, to confirm the orthology we examined in detail the orthology of the 100 gene pairs that showed unusually high rate of dS (> mean + 1.31 SD) by the phylogenetic analysis (Table 2, Fig. 1b).24 Among them 93 mKIAA genes were confirmed to be orthologs, whereas the remaining seven mKIAA genes (mKIAA0345, mKIAA0420, mKIAA0588, mKIAA1032, mKIAA1074, mKIAA1120 and mKIAA1811) were determined to be paralogs of the corresponding KIAA genes. These results suggest that most of the KIAA/mKIAA gene pairs have orthologous relationship, and if the paralogous pairs existed it must be <7%.Histogram of dS and phylogenetic tree for mKIAA/KIAA possible orthologous pairs. (a) Histograms of dS of gene pairs classified into the following three categories by chromosomal localization: (1) the gene pairs located on the corresponding chromosomal regions between human and mouse calculated by Map Viewer; these regions are considered to be derived from the common regions of the ancestral chromosome; (2) the gene pairs whose chromosomal locations were not corresponding to each other; and (3) the gene pairs whose data on the chromosome location or sequence were not available.

In this range there is a paralog (mKIAA0345; ds = 1.06885; chromosomal localization = no data).3.3. Sequence comparison of mouse and human KIAA cDNA pairsIn our previous study, we reported the sequence identity of 3′-UTR and CDSs for the 100 mouse and human KIAA cDNA pairs.2 We extended the same analysis to the 1468 gene pairs (Table 3). Similar to our previous study, the average aligned length of CDS and 3′-UTR of mKIAA and KIAA cDNAs are 2–3 times longer than reported by the other group, while the observed sequence identities of KIAA and mKIAA cDNAs in CDS and 3′-UTR agreed with the values by the other group.23 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the UTR lengths are in a narrow range whereas the CDS lengths widely change in parallel with the mRNA lengths.25 Although this narrow range of the UTR lengths is applicable to other species, the considerably long 3′-UTR sequences of mKIAA/KIAA cDNAs would be exceptional. Thus, the longer length and high conservation of 3′-UTR sequences of mKIAA/KIAA cDNAs may imply the unverified important roles in the sequences.Sequence identities of CDS and 3′-UTR between mKIAA/KIAA cDNA pairs.aWe excluded the 31 mKIAA cDNAs for the following reasons: the four mKIAA cDNAs (mKIAA0728, mKIAA1335, mKIAA1466 and mKIAA1968) aligned with only short regions (<50 amino acid residues) of the corresponding human KIAA CDSs; 20 mKIAA cDNAs incidentally identified were not orthologous to any KIAA cDNAs; and seven mKIAA cDNAs were found not to be orthologous to KIAA cDNAs in this study.bWe only calculated the lengths and the identities for the 3′-UTR when the sequence alignment was available for >50 nt residues between human and mouse. We also excluded the 31 mKIAA cDNAs mentioned in previous footnote.Sequence identities of CDS and 3′-UTR between mKIAA/KIAA cDNA pairs.aWe excluded the 31 mKIAA cDNAs for the following reasons: the four mKIAA cDNAs (mKIAA0728, mKIAA1335, mKIAA1466 and mKIAA1968) aligned with only short regions (<50 amino acid residues) of the corresponding human KIAA CDSs; 20 mKIAA cDNAs incidentally identified were not orthologous to any KIAA cDNAs; and seven mKIAA cDNAs were found not to be orthologous to KIAA cDNAs in this study.bWe only calculated the lengths and the identities for the 3′-UTR when the sequence alignment was available for >50 nt residues between human and mouse. We also excluded the 31 mKIAA cDNAs mentioned in previous footnote.3.4. Positive correlation between the brain-specific expression and the 3′-UTR length of the genesPreviously, we examined tissue-specific expression of mKIAA genes using mKIAA cDNA microarray.6 On the microarray, 1467 out of 1499 mKIAA cDNAs were spotted in this study and ∼30% of the genes were predominantly expressed in the brain. Therefore, we focused on the long 3′-UTRs to examine the relationship between brain-specific expression and their sequence features. Statistical analysis of ∼1031 clones using the Kendall rank correlation measurement revealed a significant correlation between 3′-UTR lengths and relative expression levels in the brain, exhibiting correlation coefficient (Tau) = 0.16, P = 1.7 × 10−14. However, there were no significant correlation between relative expression levels in other tissues and their 3′-UTR lengths (Table 4). To exclude the bias against the sources of cDNA libraries, the clones were subdivided into two groups (brain-derived and other tissues-derived) and statistically analysed using the same formula. Again, we observed significant correlation between 3′-UTR lengths and relative expression levels in both groups [brain, (Tau) = 0.14, P = 7.3 × 10−6, other tissues, (Tau) = 0.13, P = 1.3 × 10−5]. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between CDS or 5′-UTR lengths and relative expression levels in the brain but could not observe any significant correlation (Table 5). The lower correlation coefficient in these datasets was supposed to occur by a limited number of samples.Statistical analysis of the relationship between tissue-specific expression and 3′-UTR length of the mKIAA cDNA clones.aWe selected 1031 mKIAA cDNA clones that were verified for the integrity of the 3′-UTR structure. Our definition of the integrity is as follows: presence of canonical polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) or its single-nucleotide variants in the 35 bp upstream region of the 3′-extreme end; and absence of a stretch of >10 adenines in the sequence adjacent to the corresponding to the 3′-extreme end on genome sequence. Correlation between length of 3′-UTR and relative expression levels in each tissue (the expression value of each tissue/the mean expression value of 13 tissues) were calculated using the Kendall rank correlation measurement.Statistical analysis of the relationship between tissue-specific expression and 3′-UTR length of the mKIAA cDNA clones.aWe selected 1031 mKIAA cDNA clones that were verified for the integrity of the 3′-UTR structure.

Correlation between length of 3′-UTR and relative expression levels in each tissue (the expression value of each tissue/the mean expression value of 13 tissues) were calculated using the Kendall rank correlation measurement.The relative level of expression in brain was positively correlated with the length of 3′-UTR but not the length of CDS.a,cWe further selected 401 clones (184 clones from brain-derived library, 217 clones from other tissues-derived library) from 1031 clones in Table 4, which were verified for the integrity of the CDS and the 5′-UTR structures. Our definition of the integrity is as follows, without warning for N-terminal truncation of the coding region by GeneMark analysis.37 Correlation between lengths of 3′-UTR, CDS and 5′-UTR and relative expression levels in each tissue (the expression value of each tissue/the mean expression value of 13 tissues) were calculated using the Kendall rank correlation measurement.bTo exclude the bias against the sources of cDNA libraries, the clones were subdivided into two groups (brain-derived and other tissues-derived).The relative level of expression in brain was positively correlated with the length of 3′-UTR but not the length of CDS.a,cWe further selected 401 clones (184 clones from brain-derived library, 217 clones from other tissues-derived library) from 1031 clones in Table 4, which were verified for the integrity of the CDS and the 5′-UTR structures.

Candidates for the cDNA elements effecting on the brain-specific expression of the genesTo find the novel sequence elements in the 3′-UTRs associating with the high-level expression in brain, we searched highly conserved sequence elements between mKIAA ranked within 50 places and their orthologous KIAA cDNAs using MEME program (Author Webpage). We calculated the differences of the relative expression levels in brain between mKIAA with and without the elements, and selected 43 statistically significant (P < 10−3) elements among 66 elements that were extracted by MEME program (Table 6). We then searched the elements against 3′-UTRs of non-mKIAA genes in UTRdb entries. Consequently, we identified seven elements at the 3′-UTRs in 18 non-mKIAA genes and the elements were conserved among several species (mouse, human, rat, rabbit and bovine). Although there is little information about their expression, the predominant expression in the brain of vms-tm2 gene containing an element (TCTTTTGTTTTAAAAGAAGAAATAT) could be found in the previous report. This result was consistent with our result; further accumulation of expression data is necessary for statistical verification of functional significance of the elements.Sequence elements found in the 3′-UTR mKIAA/KIAA gene pairs showing relatively high expression in the brain.Sequence elements found in the 3′-UTR mKIAA/KIAA gene pairs showing relatively high expression in the brain.4. DiscussionTo discover novel functional aspect of UTRs, we prepared 1479 mKIAA/KIAA cDNA pairs and verified the orthology from their chromosomal location and the evolutionary rate of dS. Using these mouse cDNAs, we identified a positive correlation between the 3′-UTR length and the relative expression levels in the brain. Paying attention to the function of each gene, for instance, it appears that genes involved in G-protein signaling and vesicle trafficking dominantly expressing in the brain tended to have long 3′-UTR (data not shown). It was already assumed that 3′-UTR length increases with evolutionary age and organism complexity.26 Moreover, molecular neuroscientists have empirically noted that mRNAs, the most abundant in the brain, have long 3′-UTR. Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose that the genes predominantly expressed in mammalian brain have evolved to have long 3′-UTR. Growing evidences of RNA-binding proteins also demonstrates the importance of various 3′-UTR elements in regulation of mRNA turnover at the posttranscriptional level.27 These evidences and our result motivated us to find novel sequence elements in the 3′-UTR.MEME is a web-based tool for discovering elements in a group of related DNA sequences, thus we applied this program to find the highly conserved sequence elements in mKIAA/KIAA cDNAs revealed relatively high expression in the brain. We found 43 statistically significant elements in mKIAA/KIAA cDNAs and identified 7 out of 43 elements in the 3′-UTRs of 18 non-mKIAA genes in UTRdb. Among the several elements in 3′-UTRs that regulate the mRNA levels posttranscriptionally, the novel elements in this study might be one of such kind of elements. Biochemical approaches as well as accumulation of the expression profile of non-mKIAA genes containing the elements may help the verification of the novel elements on the predominant expression in brain. Among those elements, adenylate uridylate-rich elements (AU-rich elements, AREs) are the best characterized elements in 3′-UTR, and posttranscriptionally regulate the cytoplasmic half-life of the mRNAs encoding various proteins that regulate cellular proliferation/differentiation and response to inflammatory and environmental stimuli.28 Cytidine-rich 15-lipoxygenase differentiation control element (15-LOX DICE) is another well-characterized element in 3′-UTR and is a multifunctional cis-element found in numerous eukaryotic mRNAs.29 Although there were many AREs and 15-LOX DICEs in mKIAA cDNAs, the numbers of the elements simply correlated with the 3′-UTR length but not obviously with the relative expression level in the brain (data not shown).The elements involved in tissue, stage or cell-type specific expression of the genes had also been reported; however, the specific expression of the genes is partly due to the specific expression of certain RNA-binding proteins. For example, mRNA of membrane-bound IL-1R accessory protein expressing in a tissue-specific manner has several elements in the 3′-UTR and the stability is thought to be parallel to the expression of some RNA-binding protein.30 Neurofilament-M (NF-M) expression is stage-specific and culminates at the most mature stages of axon development. This alteration is partly regulated by the NF-M mRNA stability, parallel with the binding of hnRNP to NF-M 3′-UTRs.31 Especially in the brain, several RNA-binding proteins expressing in neuronal cell-type or stage-specific manner have been already identified; for instance, three ELAV-like proteins (HuB, HuC and HuD),32 Musashi,33 Autoimmune antigens Nova,34 polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-like protein35 and Drb1.36 In the brain, posttranscriptional regulation might be more popular than any other organ and multiple RNA-binding proteins might act through the long 3′-UTR of target genes and control them in a complex manner. Since numerous RNA-binding proteins have been reported in particularly matured neuron in which the proteins might play important roles in terminal neuronal differentiation, perpetual neurite outgrowth/retraction and synaptogenesis. Since the long 3′-UTR of mKIAA/KIAA mRNAs potentially have multiple functional elements, the mRNA levels might be regulated by the combination of multiple brain-specific RNA-binding proteins. Accumulating information about sequence elements in mRNA, neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins and their interactions is promising to solve these complicated regulations.We thank Nobue Kashima for her technical assistance.

The present findings suggested that one type of hepatic circadian genes in mice is transcriptionally regulated by core components of the circadian clock, such as CLOCK and BMAL1, and that the other depends on the adrenal gland.1. IntroductionMost organisms exhibit circadian rhythms in physiological processes, such as hormonal secretion and metabolic activities, as well as in behaviors, such as locomotor activity and feeding, which are regulated by an endogenous pacemaker. The central clock that controls most physiological and behavioral rhythms in mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain.1,2 Recent studies at the molecular level on bacteria, fungi, plants and animals suggest that one or more negative feedback loops in gene expression drive circadian oscillators.3,4 Among the circadian clock genes involved in the feedback loops, the period (per) genes are thought to play critical roles in the generation of rhythm both in Drosophila and in mammals. Numerous studies have revealed the circadian expression of per genes not only in the SCN but also in various peripheral tissues, such as the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and circulating blood cells in mammals, suggesting that an oscillatory system in peripheral tissues contains feedback loops similar to that in the SCN.3–5 Hundreds of tissue-specific circadian clock-controlled genes that regulate an impressive diversity of biological processes have been identified by DNA microarray technology.6–11 Peripheral clocks seem to be governed by the central clock in the SCN, because the circadian expression of clock or clock-controlled output genes is abolished or considerably diminished in the periphery by surgical ablation of the SCN.8,12 However, the mechanism that underlies the circadian regulation of peripheral gene expression by the SCN remains obscure.The circadian peak of blood glucocorticoids is controlled by the SCN via the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus where neurons containing corticotropin-releasing hormone regulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary.13 Glucocorticoid signaling is thought to be an important time cue for peripheral clocks from the SCN. The glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone (Dex) can induce the circadian expression of clock or clock-controlled genes in cultured fibroblasts.14 Temporal Dex injections in vivo induce transient changes in the phase of clock gene expression in liver, kidney and heart in a phase-dependent manner.14 However, glucocorticoids cannot be the only signals that set the phase of peripheral clocks since the phase of oscillators is the same in glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-deficient hepatocytes and in the livers and kidneys of adrenalectomized (ADX) mice compared with intact wild-type mice.14,15CLOCK is a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)-PAS transcription factor that binds target DNA and modulates transcription after dimerization with BMAL1 (a bHLH-PAS transcription factor).3,4 The CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer drives the rhythmic transcription of the other clock genes period (mPer1, mPer2 and mPer3) and cryptochrome (mCry1 and mCry2) through E-box (CACGTG) elements located in their promoters.3,4 Using microarray technology, we showed that a positive component of a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop of the circadian oscillator, CLOCK, is involved in the circadian transactivation of clock-controlled output genes in the mouse liver.11 The screened oscillatory genes perform various physiological functions, such as metabolism, transcription, translation, protein turnover, cell cycle, cell death, ion transport and signal transduction. The issue arising from these findings is how the oscillatory expression of only a few canonical clock genes regulates the oscillation of a vast number of clock-controlled genes.16 One possibility is that the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer directly acts on circadian gene expression. This has in fact been demonstrated with respect to the rhythmic expression of several genes, such as vasopressin,17,albumin D-site binding protein (DBP),18,19,plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1),20,prokineticin 2,21,Wee1,11,22 and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα).23 Another possibility is that the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex acts indirectly through the transactivation of other transcription factors. Indeed, our previous study showed that many transcription factors seem to be transactivated by CLOCK protein.11 Yet another alternative is that clock molecules act indirectly through the circadian production/secretion of humoral signals that can affect the gene expression in peripheral tissues.To examine the circadian regulation of gene expression in the liver, the present study analyzed genome-wide gene expression using hepatic RNA from ADX mice. We demonstrated using DNA microarrays and in vivo injection analyses that 100 hepatic genes are transcriptionally regulated by endogenous glucocorticoids in a circadian manner. These included the genes for key enzymes involved in liver functions, such as glucokinase, HMG-CoA reductase and glucose-6-phosphatase. The circadian expression of Lpin1, FKBP51 and S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase was also abolished in the ADX mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the circadian expression of several genes, such as mPer2, DBP, E4BP4, mDec1, Usp2 and Wee1, was almost totally intact in the liver of ADX mice, but extremely diminished in homozygous Clock mutant mice. The present results suggested that at least two types of circadian controlled genes are located in the mouse liver: one is directly or indirectly dependent on endogenous glucocorticoids, whereas the other is governed by core components of the peripheral clock and is not affected by ADX.2. Materials and Methods2.1. MiceBilateral ADX was performed in male C57BL/6 mice aged 7–8 weeks using the dorsal approach under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia (ketamine 91 mg/kg BW and xylazine 3.6 mg/kg BW, i.m.). The ADX mice were given free access to standard chow (CE-2, Clea Japan Inc.) and to 0.9% NaCl. Sham-operated control mice were given standard chow and water ad libitum. After the operation, apparently alert and healthy mice were housed in a 12:12 h light-dark cycle [LD12:12; lights on at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0] for at least 2 weeks before the day of the experiment. Liver samples were dissected, quickly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.To examine the transient effect of glucocorticoid injection, 3 mg/kg BW of Dex was intraperitoneally injected into the ADX mice at ZT14. After 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h, the mice were decapitated and the liver tissues were dissected.Insulin-dependent diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of the β-cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) (200 mg/kg BW) into 7-week-old Jcl:ICR mice (Clea Japan, Inc., Tokyo) as described previously.24Clock mutant mice were derived from animals supplied by J. S. Takahashi (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). The animals had the Clock allele originally on a BALB/c and C57BL/6J background. A breeding colony was established by further backcrossing with Jcl:ICR mice.25All animal experiments proceeded in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/EEC) and were approved by AIST, Japan.2.2. Microarray analysisTotal RNA was purified from pools of three animal tissues collected at each time-point using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd, Japan). Hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip (MG-U74Av2) arrays proceeded as described.11The average difference (AD) value for each gene was provided by GeneChip software. To identify putative glucocorticoid-regulated circadian genes, we compared AD values between two time points (ZT2 and ZT14) in sham-operated and in ADX mice, because endogenous blood glucocorticoid levels peak at ZT11 to ZT14 in nocturnal rodents. Among 12 473 total probe sets, 47.0% (5861 probe sets) and 45.0% (5607 probe sets) of the genes were expressed at ZT2 and ZT14, respectively, in sham-operated mice. On the other hand, 46.5% (5806 probe sets) and 44.4% (5541 probe sets) of genes were expressed in ADX mice at ZT2 and ZT14, respectively. We applied three criteria to the selection of putative glucocorticoid-regulated circadian genes: (i) the AD value is marked as ‘present’ by the GeneChip software in at least one of two time points, (ii) the AD value exhibits a 2-fold or greater change in sham-operated mice because a 2-fold expression ratio is the approximate limit of sensitivity26 and (iii) the fold change is below 2-fold in ADX mice.2.3. Northern blottingNorthern blotting proceeded as described previously.25 Random-primed 32P-labeled probes were generated from cDNA fragments of HMG-CoA reductase (bases: 1–694; GenBank accession no.

J03179), Wee1 (bases: 1089–2185; GenBank accession no. D30743), E4BP4 (bases: 61–770; GenBank accession no. U83148). Samples were normalized to the amount of GAPDH mRNA.3. Results and DiscussionThe liver is the central regulator of primary metabolism, and the circadian output reflects the physiological status of the organism and acts adaptively in nutrient assimilation and waste elimination.27,28 We identified 169 genes that fluctuated between day (ZT2) and night (ZT14) in the livers of sham-operated mice. Of these, the circadian expression of 100 genes was lost or diminished in ADX mice (Fig. 1). The key enzymes of metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, cholesterol synthesis and polyamine biosynthesis, were among the putative glucocorticoid-dependent circadian genes. On the other hand, known components or targets of the circadian clock, such as mPer2, mDec1 (shown as Bhlhb2 in Fig. 2A), DBP, USP2 and Wee1, were among the 69 genes that remained rhythmic in the ADX mice (Fig. 2).

Although daily variations in its liver activity have been recognized since 1969,29,30 circadian transcriptional regulation was not described until 2000.31 Notably, the underlying mechanism of circadian HMG-CoA reductase transactivation has remained unknown. The present study shows that the adrenal gland is involved in the circadian regulation of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression in the mouse liver (Fig. 1). Conversely, a single injection of Dex into ADX mice at the beginning of the dark phase transiently induced the expression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA but not in a rhythmic manner (Fig. 3), suggesting that endogenous glucocorticoid hormones directly regulate the expression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase at the mRNA level. The effect of glucocorticoids on the activity of HMG-CoA reductase has been reported by many researchers over the past 30 years. However, the results are often contradictory. For example, ADX has no significant effect on its diurnal rhythm,32 greatly decreases the amplitude33 or abolishes the diurnal rhythm of HMG-CoA reductase.34 A single injection of glucocorticoids in ADX rats has no effect34 or restores33 the enzyme activity. These discrepancies appeared to result from the complexity of the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity, negative feedback regulation caused by cholesterol at the transcriptional level,35 stability and degradation of the mRNA and protein,36,37 and modulation of the enzyme activity by phosphorylation, thiols and substrate.38–40 The present results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play an important role in the circadian control of serum cholesterol levels by regulating the circadian expression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. The molecular mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by glucocorticoids requires further elucidation.Transient effect of dexamethasone (Dex) injection on hepatic gene expression in adrenalectomized (ADX) mice.

Values at ZT14 are expressed as 100% in each graph and are represented as means ± SE (n = 4).The circadian fluctuation of HMG-CoA reductase activity might be regulated by changes in serum insulin concentrations, because hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression levels are very low in the diabetic rat and are quickly restored by injected exogenous insulin.41,42 Serum insulin levels were severely decreased in the ADX mice (Supplementary Figure 1 is available at Author Webpage) as they are in ADX rats.43 We therefore examined the effect of decreased endogenous insulin levels on the circadian expression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA using mice with STZ-induced diabetes (Fig. 4) in which plasma insulin levels remained consistently low throughout the day.24 The loss of insulin had surprisingly little effect on the circadian expression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in the diabetic mice, although the expression levels were slightly lower than those in control mice (Fig. 4). These observations support the notion that endogenous glucocorticoids are involved in the circadian expression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in vivo, whereas insulin is not.Temporal expression profiles of HMG-CoA reductase and glucokinase mRNAs in livers of insulin-dependent diabetic mice. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (200 mg/kg BW), which is toxic to β-cells. Insulin-dependent diabetes had little effect on the circadian expression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, but completely abolished that of glucokinase mRNA in the mouse liver.

Values are represented as means ± SE (n = 3).Bile acids decrease whole body cholesterol levels and thus maintain cholesterol homeostasis in mammals.44 Here, we found that the mRNA expression of the bile acid biosynthetic enzymes, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), fluctuated between day and night in the livers of sham-operated mice (Fig. 1) as reported previously.45–48 However, levels of the expression of both types of mRNA were continuously low in the ADX mice (Fig. 1). CYP7A1, a microsomal cytochrome P-450, is the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis. Circadian expression of its mRNA is regulated by the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, DBP.45–47 On the other hand, the microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme, CYP8B1, is involved in the synthesis of cholic acid and it controls the ratio of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Circadian expression of its mRNA is regulated by the suppressive effect of insulin.48 However, the present study found that the DBP expression levels were not affected by ADX as described below (Fig. 2). Serum insulin levels were continuously low in the ADX mice (Supplementary Figure 1 is available at Author Webpage). Thus, the ADX-induced down-regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 mRNA expression might due to the homeostatic regulation of bile acid synthesis, such as feedback inhibition of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 expression by bile acids.49 The present results suggest that serum glucocorticoids play an important role in the circadian control of cholesterol metabolism by regulating bile acid synthesis.Glucokinase is a key enzyme of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.50 Here, we showed that the circadian expression of glucokinase mRNA was diminished to low levels in the livers of ADX mice (Fig. 1). On the other hand, an intraperitoneal injection of Dex into ADX mice decreased hepatic mRNA expression over 3 h after which it recovered (Fig. 3). Glucocorticoids are thought to increase,51 not change,52,53 or decrease54,glucokinase expression in vitro. Glucokinase mRNA levels are decreased when levels of plasma glucagon and insulin are high and low (e.g. fasting or diabetes), respectively.50,55 Transcription increases 20- to 30-fold within 30–60 min of an insulin injection into a diabetic rat, or after its addition to primary cultured hepatocytes.50 Although insulin directly affects glucokinase expression, the actions of glucocorticoids are thought to be more restricted.50 The loss of the circadian rhythmicity of glucokinase mRNA expression in the ADX mice might have resulted from an ADX-induced decrease in serum insulin levels throughout the day (Supplementary Figure 1 is available at Author Webpage). We therefore examined the effect of decreased endogenous insulin levels on the circadian expression of glucokinase mRNA using mice with STZ-induced diabetes (Fig. 4). The results demonstrated that glucokinase mRNA expression levels were remarkably reduced throughout the day in mice with STZ-induced diabetes (Fig. 4), although the circadian rhythm of serum corticosterone levels was maintained.24 Thus, the ADX-induced decrease in glucokinase mRNA expression in mice seems to be associated with a lack of insulin secretion.The activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) (also a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis) shows a diurnal rhythm that increases during the day.56,57 However, its regulatory mechanism has remained unclear. We showed here that G-6-Pase mRNA levels were continuously low in the liver of ADX mice (Fig. 1). Reduced expression of the G-6-Pase mRNA in the ADX mice suggested that gluconeogenesis is suppressed in ADX mice throughout the day.The present study found that circadian gene expression of rate-limiting enzymes for glucose and cholesterol metabolisms, such as glucokinase, G-6-Pase, HMG-CoA reductase, CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, was impaired by ADX. We cannot exclude the possibility that an ADX-induced decrease in food intake is responsible for the loss of circadian gene expression, because appetite parallels glucocorticoid levels both in humans58 and in other animals.59 Nevertheless, the present results suggested that the circadian fluctuation of plasma glucocorticoids plays an important role in the time-keeping capability of an adaptive function that allows the prediction of mealtimes with consequently improved digestion and efficient energy usage.The gene expression of FKBP51 (the 51 kDa FK506-binding protein) is induced by glucocorticoid in various cell lines and tissues.60,61 We previously showed the circadian expression of FKBP51 mRNA in the mouse liver.11 In the present study, ADX abolished its circadian expression (Fig. 1). Injecting ADX mice with Dex caused a transient induction of FKBP51 mRNA in the liver (Fig. 3). Thus, the circadian expression of FKBP51 might be directly regulated by endogenous glucocorticoid. FKBP51 down-regulates glucocorticoid signaling by binding to a dimer of heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) that exists within a GR complex.60 Thus, FKBP51 might negatively regulate its own transcription by reducing the hormone sensitivity of GR. Therefore, the circadian expression of FKBP51 might affect glucocorticoid sensitivity at various times of day.Polyamines are organic cations with multiple functions in cell proliferation and differentiation.62 Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) are rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis.62 The circadian increase in ODC activity that is followed by that in mitotic activity in the liver has been understood since 1979.63 We showed here that SAMDC mRNA is expressed in the liver in a circadian manner and that such circadian expression was diminished in the ADX mice (Fig. 1). The circadian regulation of its mRNA seemed to be a direct effect of endogenous glucocorticoids, because Dex injection into the ADX mice transiently induced mRNA expression (Fig. 3). Attempts have been made to use specific inhibitors of SAMDC for cancer therapy since 1972,64 but polyamine-based drugs elicit toxic side effects.62 Further elucidation of the circadian regulatory mechanism of SAMDC expression might facilitate more effective chemotherapies by reducing side effects.Lipin is the product of the Lpin1 gene that is mutated in mice with fatty liver dystrophy (fld)65 that exhibit several phenotypic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia, defective adipocyte differentiation, impaired glucose tolerance and slow growth.66,67 Consistent with the lipodystrophic phenotype of fld mice, Lpin1 mRNA is prominently expressed in white and brown adipose tissues and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In the ADX mice, the circadian mRNA expression of hepatic Lpin1 was abolished (Fig. 1) and transiently induced more than 10-fold by Dex injection (Fig. 3). This is the first report to describe the induction of Lpin1 mRNA by glucocorticoids. The circadian expression of the mRNA and the loss of rhythmicity caused by ADX were also evident in the adipose tissue as well as in the liver (data not shown), suggesting that glucocorticoids can affect adipocyte functions by regulating Lpin1 expression. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by profound visceral adiposity and obesity as well as primary hypercortisolism.68 The mechanism for some physical features of this syndrome, such as dorsocervical-fat-pad enlargement that is called ‘buffalo hump’, remains unclear.69 Our results suggest that Lpin1 expression induced by hypercortisolism is related to the typical features of Cushing's syndrome, such as central obesity and substantial fat deposition in the face, as well as supraclavicular and dorsocervical areas.The serum amyloid A (SAA) family comprises differentially expressed apolipoproteins, acute-phase SAAs (A-SAAs) and constitutive SAAs (C-SAAs).70 Mouse SAA4 and the human SAA5 are the only known constitutively expressed SAA genes.70 The present study, however, demonstrated the endogenous glucocorticoid-regulated circadian expression of SAA4 mRNA in the mouse liver (Fig. 1). Because the C-SAAs are associated with normal and acute-phase high-density lipoprotein (HDL),70 the circadian expression of SAA4 might affect the regulation of plasma HDL levels.The functional presence of the SCN–adrenal connection is demonstrated by a light-induced fast decrease in plasma corticosterone that could not be attributed to a decrease in ACTH.71 Thus, the circadian expression of ADX-sensitive genes identified here might be affected by environmental lighting conditions via the glucocorticoid-mediated direct pathway.We identified circadian oscillating genes of which the expression rhythms were abolished by ADX. Some of these genes were among the CLOCK-regulated circadian output genes identified by microarray analyses using liver RNA isolated from homozygous Clock mutant mice.11 For example, the circadian expression of glucokinase, FKBP51, Idb1 and Lpin1 is abolished in the liver of Clock mutant mice11 and in that of ADX mice (present study). These circadian genes seemed to be indirectly affected by the Clock mutation, because the circadian fluctuation of plasma corticosterone levels is obviously affected in homozygous Clock mutant mice (Oishi, K., Ohkura, N., Shima, Y., Matsuda, J., Machida, K., Horie, S., and Ishida, N. manuscript submitted).Among the 169 genes that fluctuated between day and night, 69 were not affected by ADX (Fig. 2). These results were unpredicted, because the glucocorticoid hormones have been considered powerful time cues from the SCN to peripheral tissues.14,Figure 2 shows that the core clock component mPer2 and clock-controlled output genes, such as mDec1, DBP, E4BP4 (shown as Nfil3 in Fig. 2A), Wee1 and USP2, were included, suggesting that endogenous glucocorticoids are not essential for the circadian expression of these genes. A comparison between the present and the previous11 data from microarray analyses suggested that among 69 genes rhythmically expressed in the liver of both sham-operated and ADX mice (Fig. 2), 13 were apparently transactivated by CLOCK protein. Actually, northern blot analyses revealed that the circadian expression of these genes was notably diminished (except for mDec1) in the livers of Clock mutant mice (Fig. 5), suggesting that the circadian expression of these genes is regulated by CLOCK protein and not affected by ADX.Temporal profiles of adrenalectomy-independent circadian expressing genes in livers of homozygous Clock mutant mice.

Maximal value of WT mice is expressed as 100%. Values are represented as means ± SE (n = 4).The mRNAs of DEC1 and DEC2, which are negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors, are rhythmically expressed in the mouse SCN72,73 and peripheral tissues.74 They can repress CLOCK/BMAL1-induced transactivation of the mPer1 promoter and, therefore, might contribute to circadian clock regulation.72 The circadian expression of mDec1 mRNA is regulated by CLOCK in the SCN.73 However, CLOCK seems to be partly associated with its expression in the liver, because the rhythmic expression profile of mDec1 mRNA was slightly affected in the liver of homozygous Clock mutant mice (Fig. 5). In peripheral tissues, an autoregulatory negative feedback loop via the E-box elements located in the 5′-flanking region of mDec1 gene75 might be maintained in the livers of Clock mutant mice.The bZIP transcription factor, E4BP4, is expressed in a circadian manner in the SCN and peripheral tissues of mice.76 E4BP4 appears to act as a transcriptional repressor because it lacks a C-terminal PAR region.77 The phase of E4BP4 mRNA expression was almost opposite to that of DBP (Figs 2 and 5). The present study showed that the circadian expression of E4BP4 was not affected by ADX in the mouse liver (Fig. 2), although the mRNA expression is induced by glucocorticoids at least in vitro.78 Moreover, the expression levels of E4BP4 mRNA were continuously high in Clock mutant mice (Fig. 5), although they are continuously low in the liver of mCry1/mCry2 double knockout mice.76 These results and our present findings suggest that the circadian expression of E4BP4 mRNA is negatively regulated by some transcription factors, the expression of which is positively regulated by CLOCK protein.11 Antiphasic circadian expression of E4BP4 and DBP might augment the amplitude of downstream circadian genes via the common cis-element, because DBP activates and E4BP4 represses transcription.77Glucocorticoids are not only important Zeitgebers for peripheral clock synchronization by the SCN14,15 but also strong homeostatic regulators of metabolic reactions against various environmental stresses. Circadian changes in metabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis/glycolysis and cholesterol biosynthesis, seem to be useful for normal sleep/wake cycles. However, organisms must adapt hepatic metabolic reactions to unusual environmental conditions, such as inflammation and starvation. Thus, the glucocorticoid-regulated gene expression of key enzymes for hepatic metabolism is apparently physiologically important for both circadian and homeostatic adaptation. On the other hand, the phase of endogenous clocks in peripheral tissues should be stable and resistant to daily stressors. In the present study, circadian expression of clock or clock-related genes, such as mPer2, DBP, mDec1 and E4BP4, remained almost intact in the liver of ADX mice. In addition, the steady-state phase of these genes was unaffected in the GR-deficient mouse liver.14 Terazono et al.79 reported that the stimulation of both adrenergic and sympathetic nerves could entrain peripheral clocks in the livers of intact and SCN-lesioned mice. These observations suggest that endogenous glucocorticoid hormones are not essential for keeping the phase of hepatic clocks in mice. Multiple pathways seem to participate in conveying the time cue from the SCN to peripheral clocks in vivo.In summary, we showed that the circadian expression of one type of liver genes is governed by core components of the circadian clock, such as CLOCK and BMAL1, whereas that of the other depends on the adrenal gland that is responsible for endogenous glucocorticoids. Moreover, the present results implied the existence of several glucocorticoid-regulated ‘pseudo-rhythmic’ genes, because injections of Dex into ADX mice induced the transient, but not the circadian expression of these genes. Further elucidation of the regulation mechanism of circadian gene expression in vivo should improve understanding of physiological circadian rhythms in the liver.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary material is available online at Author WebpageThe authors thank J.

IntroductionThe Human genome sequencing project delivered the complete DNA sequence of our species.1,2 Numerous data mining tools allowed gene identification, prediction, annotation and precise localization. The availability of these data promises breakthroughs in the understanding of human pathologies. Important progresses could be particularly expected in regard to multifactorial pathologies, determined by interactions between a variable number of genes and characterized by complex phenotypes.Among the multifactorial diseases, Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21 is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation. This pathology is the most common autosomal trisomy, with an incidence of 1 in 700 live births, in comparison with other trisomies such as Trisomy 18 (1 : 3500) or Trisomy 13 (1 : 7000). DS phenotypes are variable, affecting many different organs and tissues including brain (mental retardation, increased occurrence of Alzheimer's disease), muscle, heart, skeleton, intestine and blood. Metabolic disorders are also observed as neurotransmitter alterations and hormonal imbalances.3–7 However, only mental retardation is invariably present in DS patients. In most cases, DS results of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in all cells of the afflicted individuals.8 In some rare cases, DS results from a partial trisomy 21 showing variable phenotypes depending on triplicated region. Clinical, cytogenetic and molecular analysis of such patients allowed the identification of Down syndrome Chromosomal Region-1 (DCR-1), at 21q22.2 sub-band, responsible for many features of the DS, including mental retardation.9,10DS may be considered as a multifactorial disease with an unusual etiology determined by the overexpression of several chromosome 21 genes. The number of the genes involved in the DS pathogenesis remains undetermined and candidate genes should be searched on whole chromosome 21, particularly in the DCR-1. Extensive efforts have been carried out to construct transcriptional map of the DCR-1 region.11 The complete sequencing of the human chromosome 21,12 its transcriptional activity analysis13 and the frequent updations of the genomic sequence identified >300 genes, of which at least 28 are localized in the DCR-1. It is from these that etiological genes for DS will be identified, since all of them may be potential candidate genes. To date, only few genes in DCR-1 have been studied as candidate genes, DYRK1A,14 and SIM2.15,16 These two human genes are orthologs of the Drosophila minibrain and single minded genes17,18 both involved in Drosophila central nervous system development. Interestingly, overexpression of the mammalian Dyrk1A and Sim2 genes determines some impairments in behavior, memory and learning capacities.19,20We have previously identified C21orf5 gene as a new transcriptional unit in DCR-1 region.11 More recently, we have investigated the expression pattern of the C21orf5 mouse ortholog and identified an interesting specific transcriptional profile in the medial temporal-lobe system,21 a key system involved in memory storage.22 On the basis of these findings, we studied C21orf5 as a new candidate gene for DS and proposed a potential role in brain morphogenesis, and overexpression of this gene could participate in neurological alterations and mental retardation seen in DS patients.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bioinformatic sequence studiesSequences with similarity to C21or5 were identified by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) family of program (Author Webpage) searches for similarity to sequences contained in GeneBank.The sequence data were accessed through NCBI (Author Webpage); Human Genome Browser Gateway of the Santa Cruz University (Author Webpage) and Ensembl Project (Author Webpage).Complete genome and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data were also accessed through the following specialized sites: Caenorhabditis elegans (Author Webpage); Fugu (Author Webpage); Mouse (Author Webpage); Rat (Author Webpage); Drosophila (Author Webpage).Multiple sequence alignments were performed with BLAST 2 sequence program, for sequence pairs (Author Webpage) and the alignment CLUSTALW algorithm (Author Webpage). The output files were visualized using the Boxshade program (Author Webpage). Percent identities were derived from the CLUSTALW output.SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool; Author Webpage) and PFSCAN (Author Webpage) programs were used to study protein domain structures, to identify Prosite profiles and Pfam domains in the protein sequences.The hydrophobicity profiles and α-helix propensity of the proteins were analyzed using algorithms available at ProtScale (Author Webpage).Phylogenetic relationships were analyzed using the Phylogenetic Tree Prediction program (Author Webpage).2.1. Normal and transgenic animals and tissuesNormal and transgenic littermates were used for in situ hybridization using a C21orf5 riboprobe. Independent lines of transgenic mice containing separate YAC DNAs have been created. Together, the transgenic YACs cover ∼2 Mb of contiguous human sequence from DCR-1 that represented an in vivo library for phenotypic screening.23 Among these independent transgenic mouse lines, we studied two lines both carrying one copy of the human 230E8 YAC, containing C21orf5 gene.11 By amplification of several fragments of the gene sequence, we determined that C21orf5 is entirely contained in the transgenic human YAC integrated into the mouse genome and by RT–PCR we determined that the human gene was expressed in the transgenic mice.21Adult brains were dissected, freshly embedded in OCT and frozen quickly over liquid nitrogen. Sections (10 µm) were cut in cryostat (Leika) and stored at −20°C until hybridization.2.3. Non-radioactive in situ hybridizationCryosections were air-dried, washed in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v). Sections were incubated in PBS for 1 h and washed three times with 1× TE, pH 8.0, for 2 min each. Finally, they were washed twice in 2× SSC for 5 min. Prehybridization was done in 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 5% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt solution, and 500 ng/ml salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 55°C. Human cDNA (1600–2800 bp) were used as template to generate sense and antisense riboprobes for in situ hybridization, by Sp6 and T7 RNA polymerases (Promega) incorporating digoxigenin-UTP (Boehringer). Hybridization was done overnight at 65°C with digoxigenin riboprobe (200 ng/ml). After washes in SSC solutions at increasing stringency, hybridized probes were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin Fab fragment (Boehringer), as described.21 The negative controls underwent the same procedure using the corresponding sense riboprobe.2.4. RT–PCR quantificationReal-time PCR was performed using the LightCycler thermal cycler system (Roche Diagnostics) with the Amplification kit SYBR Green mix. Poly A+ RNA was prepared from cerebrum of adult mice using the Fast track kit (Invitrogen). After a DNAse purification step (Qiagen), RNA concentrations were spectrophotometrically assessed. Reverse transcription was performed using the Retroscript kit with random decamers (Ambion). From a total volume of 50 µl per cDNA, 8 µl were used to prepare five dilutions which were used in the real-time PCR reaction. For gene expression assays, the reference oligonucleotides were chosen at crossing point (Cp) levels equivalent to those observed for the target: ppib (MMU9) fwd: GGATTTGGCTACAAAAACAGCAA; rev: AGCCAGGCCCGTAGTGCTTC; the target oligonucleotides for C21orf5 mouse and human mRNAs were fwd: CCTACCTCTGCCTGAGCTTCC; rev: CTCTCCTCAAAGAGGCTGTCC. No primer dimers were observed during amplification. The slopes of the standard curves were between C3.3 and C3.7. Ratios between transgenic and wild-type values were obtained by using the δ (δ Cp) method with reference curves established for each experiment.3. Results and DiscussionPreviously, we have performed a transcriptional map of the 2 Mb DCR-1 critical region for DS, located at 21q22.2 sub-band, using exon trapping and cDNA selection.11 Among the 27 transcriptional units identified, we isolated human cDNA clones corresponding to a new gene, C21orf5 that we localized between CBR324 and KIAA013625 genes. The genomic sequence of C21orf5, spanning ∼130 kb, consists in 37 exons. The 8.5 kb C21orf5 mRNA encodes a putative protein of 2298 amino acids (NM_005128).We have also previously identified the C. elegans homolog, pad-1, involved in morphogenesis control.26 To identify other C21orf5 homologs and analyze sequence conservation during evolution, we searched translated genomic sequences showing homologies with the C21orf5 protein sequence in specialized databases for different species (see Materials and Methods). We identified two other known genes showing significant homologies with the human C21orf5: Aspergillus nidulans DopA27 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DOP128 genes. In addition to these known genes, we found deduced homolog protein sequences in mouse, rat, fugu and Drosophila genomes. We also identified several ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) for these species, suggesting that the putative genomic sequences are transcribed and correspond to C21orf5 homolog genes.Using global alignment of these homologous protein sequences, we identified two highly conserved regions (Fig. 1): an N-terminal region, corresponding to the first 300 amino acids of the human sequence; and a C-terminal region, corresponding to the 1944–2178 interval of the human sequence. Although a large variable central region, the protein sequences showed significant identity percent between sequence pairs (Table 1). The high phylogenic distance between the considered species could have determined accumulation of neutral mutations during evolution that decreases the identity percents in sequence alignments.Multiple sequence alignment of homologous C21orf5 proteins.

Hs: human; Mm: mouse; Rn: rat; Fr: fugu; Dm: Drosophila; Ce: C. elegans; An: A. nidulans.Venkatarajan and Braun29 performed a cluster analytical study using a 5D descriptors measuring differences by physical–chemical properties of the 20 amino acids involved in protein synthesis and defined a hierarchic classification in six functional amino acid groups. We applied this functional classification to C21orf5 homolog sequences and the identity percents were calculated again on the entire sequences. An increase of identity percents was observed particularly between the human and lower species sequences (Table 1). This finding suggested that some protein sequence differences correspond to conserved mutations. Homology analysis of the more conserved N- and C-terminal regions showed high identity percent between sequence pairs that are greatly increased (Table 1) using the Venkatarajan and Braun's functional classification.29Interestingly, we found that the C-terminal region of C21orf5 protein sequence showed very high homology with a leucine zipper-like motif, called Dopey. Firstly identified in the A. nidulans DopA protein,27 the Dopey motif consists in two adjacent leucine zipper-like domains. Leucine zipper domains are normally characterized by repeated leucines, separated by seven amino acids. In these Dopey leucine zipper-like motifs, some leucines were substituted with functionally similar amino acids (valine, isoleucine, methionine or phenylalanine) and less frequently with other hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 2A and B). In addition to the homolog C21orf5 complete sequences, we found partial sequences corresponding to the Dopey zipper-like domain in ESTs of other species for which the complete cDNA is unknown (Cow, AW462239; Marmot, BI416456 and Chicken, BU460448). Comparison of these sequences (Fig. 2A and B) showed that the Dopey motifs are very highly conserved, particularly the first leucine zipper-like domain, from Human to Fungi. Homology analysis of these two zipper domain showed high identity percents between sequence pairs (Table 1) that greatly increased using the Venkatarajan and Braun's functional classification29 (Table 1).Sequence analyses of the Dopey leucine zipper-like motifs.

To test the functionality of the Dopey leucine zipper-like domains, we analyzed the hydrophobic profile30 of the two zipper-like motifs and their propensity to form α-helix structures,31 in different species. Interestingly, very similar profiles were observed (Fig. 2D–G), confirming the high functional conservation of the Dopey domains. Protein sequence scanning was also performed to search other functional domains, but, although some transmembrane domains and phosphorylation sites were found, none of them appeared significantly identified. We also analyzed the evolution of these sequences and we observed a linear evolution following the phylogenesis (Fig. 2C), suggesting a common origin of the ancestral sequence.Independent lines of transgenic mice containing human YACs have been created, which together cover the DCR-1, and represent an in vivo library for phenotypic screening.23 We studied two of these independent transgenic lines carrying the human YAC 230E8. This YAC, ∼600 kb in length, is localized between RH103382 and SHGC-51957 STS markers. We demonstrated that C21orf5 sequence is entirely contained in the transgenic 230E8 YAC21 and that they expressed the transgenic human C21orf5 gene, in addition to the normally expressed mouse ortolog,21 determining a global overexpression for this gene.To assess the level of C21orf5 mRNA in transgenic animals carrying the YAC 230E8, we have performed quantitative real-time RT–PCR experiments, using the sybr green technology (LightCycler thermal cycler system), on poly A+ RNA cerebrum samples from wild-type and transgenic adult littermates using oligonucleotides from two reference genes mouse ppib (MMU9) (Fig. 3) and mouse lzst1 (MMU8) (data not shown) and oligonucleotides co-amplifying human and mouse cDNA for C21orf5. With both references, the C21orf5 mRNAs were found significantly increased: by 1.83 ± 0.18 (P = 0.0083) compared with ppib and by 1.97 ± 0.24 (P = 0.01) compared with lzst1, indicating that the human gene is expressed at the same level as the mouse gene, demonstrating an overexpression in brain tissue (Fig. 3).C21orf5 mRNA levels analyzed in cerebrum by real-time RT–PCR in wild-type animals (WT) and transgenics (TG230E8) as compared with ppib mRNA levels showing C21orf5 overexpression (P < 0.01).C21orf5 mRNA levels analyzed in cerebrum by real-time RT–PCR in wild-type animals (WT) and transgenics (TG230E8) as compared with ppib mRNA levels showing C21orf5 overexpression (P < 0.01).On the basis of the expression of C21orf5 murine ortholog in specific brain regions,21 we investigated whether it could play a role in cerebral development. In situ hybridization was performed using a human C21orf5 probe on brain sections of normal and transgenic 230E8 mice (Fig. 4). Interestingly, we found that transgenic mice showed increased cortical cells that overexpressed C21orf5 compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4).Morphological alteration in the cortex of transgenic mice overexpressing C21orf5. C21orf5 expression pattern was showed in the cortex of normal (A) and transgenic (B) mice.

C21orf5 expression pattern was showed in the cortex of normal (A) and transgenic (B) mice. An increase of C21orf5-expressing cells in the cortex of transgenic mice (B) compared with their wild-type littermates (A) was identified.Our genomic analysis showed high homologies suggesting that C21orf5 homologs exist probably in all species and they appeared conserved throughout the evolution. Interestingly, application of a functional hierarchic classification of the amino acid29 increases the identity percent, suggesting that sequence variations between species are conservative mutations, in agreement to a conserved functional role of the Dopey family.Dopey leucine zipper-like family included three members, all of the Fungi phylum: A. nidulans DopA,27,S. cerevisiae DOP128 and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dop1 (NP_592953). Here, we extended this protein family to C. elegans, Drosophila, Fugu, Mouse, Rat and Human C21orf5 proteins, such as to all other putative C21orf5 homologs. Members of the Dopey family have two large highly conserved domains in N- and C-termini. The N-terminus, the higher conserved region of the Dopey proteins, is leucine rich. Overexpression of either the homologous A. nidulans DopA or S. cerevisiae Dop1 N-terminal domains causes the loss of correct growth polarity and budding pattern in yeasts27 suggesting a functional role of this domain. In the C-terminus, two leucine-like zipper domains were observed. Several indications suggest that they are functional leucine zipper domains: (i) Amino acid changes observed in leucine canonical positions correspond generally to conservative variations. (ii) We showed that hydrophobic profiles and propensity to form α-helix structures were similar in sequences in different species for the two leucine zipper domains; (iii) Temperature-sensitive Dop1a mutation, which alters one of the leucine zippers, showed similar phenotype than null mutant ΔdopA, in A. nidulans.27The Dopey leucine-like zipper domain, such as the other leucine zipper domains, could be involved in multiple protein–protein interactions of several transcription factors, suggesting that the proteins of the Dopey family might act as transcriptional co-activators. Moreover, this domain appeared highly conserved and its evolution, according to phylogenesis, suggests a common origin of the ancestral sequence. In agreement to a transcriptional function of this protein family, it is known that A. nidulans DopA modulates expression of the key transcriptional regulators of the asexual and sexual cycle, brlA, abaA and steA.27 Their expression patterns are altered in DopA mutants, suggesting that DopA functions upstream in the developmental pathway.At this time, functional roles are known for three members of the Dopey family: the A. nidulans DopA, the S. cerevisiae DOP1 and the C. elegans pad-1. DopA mutants determine drastically reduced conidiation in A. nidulans caused by aberrant cell morphology and asynchronous cell differentiation.27,32 The budding yeast homolog DOP1 is also involved in establishing cellular morphogenesis, and its inactivation was lethal.27,28 The C. elegans ortholog, pattering defective 1 (pad-1), when inactivated by dsRNA-mediated interference (RNAi),26 showed a lethal phenotype characterized by dramatic alteration of gastrulation and morphogenesis during embryonic worm development. Therefore, mutations of all these three C21orf5 homolog genes determine morphological abnormalities both in two very far species such as the Fungi A. nidulans and S. cerevisiae, and in a complex multicellular organism, the nematode worm C. elegans.We have found that transgenic mice carrying human C21of5 overexpressed this gene, by in situ hybridization and real-time RT–PCR, and showed an altered cortex with increased C21orf5-expressing cells compared with their wild-type littermates. We observed the same abnormalities in cortical layers in the two independent transgenic mouse lines produced by Smith et al.,23 suggesting that the cortical phenotype is specific for the presence of the 230E8 YAC. In addition, we performed morphological analysis of brain regions in other transgenic mouse lines carrying three human YAC localized in DCR-1 critical region and not containing C21orf5 gene.23 These transgenic lines did not show alterations in the cortex similar to the phenotype observed in the two 230E8 transgenic lines (unpublished data) and only behavioural alterations were observed in the transgenic lines carrying 152F7 YAC, containing the human minibrain gene, DYRK1A.23Ours and previous findings suggest that C21orf5 is a good candidate gene for the morphological phenotype in cortical lamination observed in the transgenic line overexpressing this gene: C21orf5 shows a restricted expression in mouse cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum.21 Interestingly, these three brain regions play key roles in learning and memory, and they correspond to altered brain structures observed in DS patients.33The analyzed transgenic mice overexpressed the C21orf5 gene in the cortex and cerebrum at similar level than found in DS human lymphoblasts.21Mutations of some members of the Dopey family, A. nidulans DopA, S. cerevisiae Dop1 and C. elegans pad1, determine morphological abnormalities.26–28 Protein sequence conservation in invertebrate and vertebrate Dopey family members also suggested a conserved function in the control of morphogenesis throughout phylogenesis until the human member, C21orf5.The transgenic mice overexpressing C21orf5 showed also mild impairment in learning and memory23 that could be caused by the cortical abnormalities. Interestingly, these mouse phenotypes correspond well to DS neurological alterations characterized by mental retardation and neuromorphological alterations, particularly the abnormal lamination pattern found in the cortex of DS patients.33 On these bases, we proposed that the human C21orf5 could play a role in human morphogenesis of the cortex and that the overexpression of this gene in DS could participate in morphological features seen in trisomic brains and in mental retardation pathogenesis.This work was supported by the Pasteur Institute, Paris 7 University and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).

To help laboratories without a bioinformatics infrastructure, we implemented the tool in a user-friendly website (Author Webpage).DNA microarray technology has allowed the study of gene expression in a genomic scale, changing the paradigm of expression studies of a single gene to a high-throughput framework. As this technology becomes cost accessible, more laboratories can use it as a routine technique.1 By comparing two samples labeled with different fluorescent dyes, one can classify a gene as differentially expressed (or divergent, if dealing with genomic hybridizations) using a variety of statistical methods.2–4 The ideal design of microarray experiments consists in having as many biological and technical replicates as possible, so that the data can be analyzed using state-of-art statistical tools. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to fulfill these replication requirements.For instance, in laboratories with financial restrictions, the microarrays are used as a high-throughput screening tool. In this case, it is preferable to perform low replicated experiments and test different biological conditions. Another example is the study of rare human diseases. This kind of research is naturally constrained to low replication, since the RNA available usually comes from only one or two patients. Although not ideally replicated, these studies are undoubtedly important. However, they will not be properly analyzed using traditional or state-of-art statistical methods that require a number of replicates and assume certain hypothesis concerning the distribution of the samples that cannot be verified.The aim of this work is to provide an easy-to-use bioinformatics solution for the analysis of microarrays constrained to low replication. To achieve our objective, we explored simultaneously two widely accepted ideas in microarray analysis: the determination of intensity-dependent cutoffs using self–self experiments5–7 and the use of non-parametric methods.8–10 Our contribution is to implement a web-based tool to help the analysis of microarray datasets with low replication designs. The web-based interface is freely available at Author Webpage.When analyzing a microarray data, a major question is how to classify a gene as differentially expressed. To answer this question, it is necessary to set a cutoff level for hybridization intensities ratios that permits one to decide whether a gene is differentially expressed or not. In mathematical terms, this step consists in testing the null hypothesis H0: ‘the spot has no differential hybridization between the two probed samples’.There are many mathematical approaches to define cutoffs and reject H0.2–4 A simple and widely used strategy consists in arbitrarily choosing a constant ratio, commonly the 2-fold change threshold. Spotted genes with ratios above this threshold are considered as differentially hybridized. To bring some statistical rigor, it is common to perform traditional statistical tests such as the t-test, using log-ratios and an arbitrary threshold. It will provide a p-value to access the significance level of the test for a given gene. To be adequately applied, one has to verify that the log-ratios for the given gene are normally distributed and that the number of observations is not scarce. Another approach is to assume a statistical model for the whole slide behavior (commonly a t-student like or a normal model), define it as the null probability density function (pdf) and search for outliers.2–4 Again, this strategy requires the data to be distributed according to some known and arbitrarily proposed model. Since this assumption does not always hold for microarray data, different non-parametric procedures have been proposed to define the null pdf of the hybridization log-ratios for a given gene.8–10 However, since they are usually based on resampling, permutation, standard deviation estimation, order/rank statistics, etc., it might not be a good choice to derive the pdf for an individual gene with few experimental observations.Another category of approaches to define cutoffs relies on experimental strategies such as the use of self–self hybridizations. Self–self experiments are performed by labeling the same biological material with either Cy3 and Cy5 dyes and hybridizing them simultaneously on the same microarray slide. This strategy has been used to derive intensity-dependent cutoffs to classify a gene as differentially expressed5,,6,,11 or divergent in comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies.7,,12 The comparative analysis of constant fold change cutoffs and intensity-dependent ones has been extensively discussed, showing a superior performance of the intensity-dependent strategy.5–7,,11,,12In our tool, we make use of self–self experiments to derive the null probability density function of the test. Since the null hypothesis ‘there is no differential hybridization between the two probed samples’ holds for all the genes in a self–self experiment, it is possible to escape from the gene-by-gene schema and use all the spotted genes to derive the null pdf. With an adequate amount of observations (all the spotted genes), the use of non-parametric methods is now feasible. To take into account the intensity-dependent feature of the data, the null pdf is estimated in a user-defined sliding-window, which slides over all the range of the spots' intensity measure. This procedure results in the determination of intensity-dependent cutoffs that are readily applicable to non-self–self experiments. It is implicitly assumed that the same stochastic processes that generated the experimental noise in self–self experiments are acting in non-self–self data. Therefore, log-ratios above or below the intensity-dependent cutoffs can be classified as differentially expressed. The use of these experimentally derived cutoffs relaxes the requirement of replicates, since it does not count on standard deviation estimations, resampling or permutations. Moreover, it adds an empirically derived criteria to classify a gene as differentially expressed in studies constrained to low replication.Our web-based tool expects a normalized data set as input. Microarray data usually must be normalized due to multiplicative biases such as unequal brightness of fluorescent dyes, unequal incorporation rate of dyes, etc. Such preprocessing procedures are well discussed and web-tools to address this problem are available elsewhere.13–15 Next, we will describe the mathematical details behind our method.Let A = log2(cy3)/2 + log2(cy5)/2 and M = log2(R), as usual in microarray analysis,16 be the random variables of interest, where cy3 and cy5 are the fluorescence intensities and R is the suitably normalized intensities ratio. To represent our measurement, we prefer to use the M–A plot, where the variable A shows the dependence of the log-ratios on the average spot intensity. The procedure can be used with arbitrary reparametrizations of hybridization ratio and measurements of fluorescence intensities. An observation of a spot s is one realization of (A,M) and is denoted by (as,ms). Therefore, self–self hybridization measurements are samples drawn from the (A,M) bidimensional null joint pdf. To find the intensity-dependent log-ratio cutoffs, we first select a sliding-window in A, which is defined by the user. The observed spots (as, ms) contained in this window will be used to define the M|A null pdf locally. This pdf is estimated by applying the gaussian Kernel Density Estimator.After estimating the null pdf of M for a given A window, the user-defined credibility interval can be determined. In short, our algorithm to define intensity-dependent cutoffs is the user defines a sliding window for A axis inputting two parameters: the window size and the walking pace. Each step of the sliding window delimits an arbitrary subinterval of A;for each subinterval of A selected in (i), estimate the probability density function of M|A using gaussian Kernel Density Estimator;integrate the probability density function from (ii) around the mode until the user-defined probability is reached. The intervals obtained are called the α credibility intervals;the steps (ii) and (iii) are repeated until the window has slid over all the A range.Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the algorithm in an arbitrarily chosen step. It was performed using the self–self data from a genomotyping study in the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa. Figure 2 shows the result of the self–self derived intensity-dependent cutoffs for this data. Since we know that there should not exist true differential hybridization in self–self experiments, it is clear that the commonly used 2-fold change would be conservative for high intensity spots and permissive for low intensity ones.Snapshot of one step of the sliding window process.

They were obtained by the sliding window process using a 99.5% credibility level, 0.3 pace and 1.0 window size.After defining the intensity-dependent cutoffs, different microarray experiments made within the same technical conditions of self–self data can be evaluated. For example, suppose that a spot measurement (a,m) shows a log-ratio m outside its intensity-dependent 99% credibility cutoff. It can be classified as a differentially expressed spot since there is just 1% of chance that its measured log-ratio is due to random technical errors. This hypothesis test is applied to all spots. Since the test is applied to an individual spot, it does not depend on the number of replicates. If one has a number of replicated observations for a given gene, after applying the test to each spot, it is possible to evaluate easily if they are above or below the intensity-dependent cutoff and classify the gene as differentially expressed. Our tool has been successfully applied to a recently published gene expression study in Xylella fastidiosa.18 It can also be useful for CGH studies.12To use many of the available statistical tools, it is necessary to have well-replicated designs. Although many efforts have been carried out to sample as many replicates as possible, sometimes it is still difficult to achieve a well-replicated design. Financial restrictions or even biological constraints concerning rare RNA samples do not allow some researchers to analyze their microarray data according to current statistical standards. With this web-based tool, we hope to help these researchers to extract the invaluable information from their datasets constrained to low replication.R.V. and T.K. were fellows of Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP).

There does not appear to be any correlation between plant habit and chloroplast genome composition and arrangement.Eucalyptus globulus is one of the most economically important species for hardwood forestry plantations in temperate regions of the world.1 It has been studied intensively by quantitative, population and evolutionary geneticists and is becoming a model species for genetic research in Eucalyptus. Chloroplast DNA has been essential to many studies of population genetics and phylogeography in Eucalyptus. This paper presents the complete chloroplast genome from E. globulus and compares it with chloroplast genomes from other angiosperm taxa [including the hardwood tree species, Populus trichocarpa (B. Heinz, S. DiFazio, K. Ritland et al., manuscript in preparation)] and softwood tree species (Pinus thunbergii2 and Pinus koraiensis).The complete chloroplast genome of E. globulus (GenBank accession no. AY780259) may be represented as a circular chromosome (Fig. 1), although this is likely to be a rare form of the molecule, as most chloroplast DNA is, in fact, linear.3,4 Comprising 160 286 bp, it ranks among the larger land plant chloroplast genomes. Most land plant plastids sequenced to date have genomes of 116–163 kb, and the longest belongs to Oenothera elata (163 935 bp5). The structure of the E. globulus chloroplast genome is typical of most plastids: a large single copy (LSC) region (89 012 bp) and a small single copy (SSC) region (18 488 bp) are separated by an inverted repeat (IR) (26 393 bp). The relative sizes of the LSC, SSC and IR regions remain reasonably constant across genomes of angiosperms (approximately 55, 12 and 16.5% of the total genome size, respectively), regardless of the overall size of the genome. The relative size of the IR in gymnosperms varies much more. For example, in Ginkgo biloba the IR is 17 kb, but in P. thunbergii it is just 495 bp2 containing trnI-CAU and 83 bp from the 3′ end of psbA, but lacking the ribosomal RNA genes that characterize other land plant IRs.Gene map of the plastid chromosome of Eucalyptus globulus. Genes belonging to different functional groups are color coded (see key). Genes drawn inside the circle are transcribed clockwise; those outside the circle are transcribed anti-clockwise.

ORF366 in IRB is a truncated form of ycf1.The Eucalyptus chloroplast genome has a GC-content of 36.9%, which is comparable with that of other vascular plant plastids (e.g. 36.7% in Populus, 37.8% in Nicotiana, 38.4% in Zea, 39.2% in Oenothera and 38.5% in P. thunbergii). The genome is AT-rich in both the non-coding intergenic regions (67% AT) and the coding regions (62% AT), where there is an AT bias (73% ± 4.5%) in the third base positions of all amino acid codons. This phenomenon is also observed in other plastid genomes. In contrast, the tRNA genes show less of an AT bias (58%), and the rRNA genes have a slight GC bias (55%). The latter is characteristic of rRNA genes in other plants.6Table 1 lists all genes detected in the chloroplast genome of E. globulus. The start codons for the protein-coding genes were based on alignments with plastomes of other taxa. The start positions are, therefore, hypothetical and can be confirmed only through analysis of gene transcripts. The genome is essentially co-linear with that of the annual angiosperm Nicotiana tabacum (Fig. 2a), with all the same genes except sprA, which is absent from E. globulus. The chloroplast genome of E. globulus is also virtually co-linear with that from another hardwood tree species, P. trichocarpa (Fig. 2b), except for three notable differences: (i) rps16 and flanking intergenic sequences (∼1800 bp of LSC) are missing from Populus; (ii) the gene rpl32 and flanking sequences (∼1100 bp of SSC) are absent from Populus; and (iii) the IR in Populus has expanded to include rps19, with the ‘extra’ copy of this gene located close to JLA. As in other angiosperms, the E. globulus plastome has four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and 30 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (of which seven are located in the IRs) that provide tRNAs for all 20 amino acids (Table 1). There are 78 protein-coding genes, including four conserved open reading frames (ORFs) (‘ycfs’). Approximately 74 protein-coding genes are common to most angiosperm chloroplast genomes, and an additional 5 are present in only some species.7 Of these five, four (accD, ycf1, ycf2 and rpl23) appear to be functional in the plastome of E. globulus, but the fifth, infA, is a pseudogene (ψ), as in Populus, Nicotiana, Arabidopsis and Oenothera.7 One other pseudogene was detected, that of a hypothetical chloroplast protein, ψycf15. One open reading frame, ORF113, has high homology to regions of ycf68 in rice, maize and Pinus, as well as to hypothetical proteins ORF119 and ORF58 in the trnI intron of Oenothera. A second open reading frame, ORF366, is found in IRB at the junction with the SSC. It is a truncated inverted repeat of ycf1 and is probably non-functional.Harr plot analysis comparing chloroplast genomes from an annual angiosperm, hardwood (angiosperm) trees and softwood (gymnosperm) trees: a) Nicotiana tabacum and Eucalyptus globulus; b) E. globulus and Populus trichocarpa; c) Pinus koraiensis and Pinus thunbergii; and d) E. globulus and P. thunbergii.

Four major ycfs have been partially characterized, but their precise functions are not yet understood. Two highly conserved ycfs, ycf1 and ycf2, have been demonstrated to be essential to cellular function in dicots;8 they are not involved in photosynthesis, but are speculated to be involved in cellular metabolism or to have a structural role in the plastid.8 Two more ycfs, ycf 3 and ycf 4, are believed to be involved in the formation of photosystem I.9,10 The functionality of some other ycfs, however, has been brought into question by the relatively frequent occurrence of pseudo-ycf loci. For example, although ycf15 in tobacco appears to be a potentially functional protein-coding gene, in many other species—including E. globulus—a variable insertion of ∼250 bp (295 bp in E. globulus) introduces premature stop codons. Schmitz-Linneweber et al.11 showed that although the ycf15 cistron may be transcribed, splicing of the two conserved ends does not occur; hence, ycf15 is probably not a protein-coding gene. The ycf15 sequences of E. globulus and Oenothera are very similar after the removal of their insertions. However, both with and without the intervening sequence, ycf15 of both taxa have premature stop codons, providing further evidence that ycf15 is probably not a functional protein-coding gene. Another example of a ycf that has highly conserved domains, but often is not completely conserved, is ycf68. In E. globulus, ORF113 is highly homologous to a small region of ycf68 in rice and maize, ORF75 in P. koraiensis, ORF75a in P. thunbergii and a hypothetical protein in O. elata (ORF58). All these ORFs have some homology to ycf68. Such ORFs and ycfs that have some highly conserved regions may have roles in gene regulation (e.g. as promotor or terminator sequences) or may be genes specifying a structural RNA11 (as was at first proposed for sprA in tobacco chloroplasts,12 but was later discounted13).The psbL gene that codes for a 38 amino acid peptide of photosystem II is highly conserved among many higher plants. This gene is unusual because in Eucalyptus, as well as in some other taxa (e.g. Nicotiana and Spinacia, but not Populus), transcription of the gene does not require any of the standard chloroplast initiation codons [i.e. leucine (TTG, CTG), isoleucine (ATT, ATC, ATA), valine (GTG) or, the most common, methionine (ATG)]. Instead, ACG appears at the beginning of the gene. It has been shown in Nicotiana that a translatable psbL mRNA containing an AUG initiator codon is formed by C to U editing of the ACG codon,14 and it is possible that a similar mechanism exists in Eucalyptus.In general, the chloroplast genome of E. globulus is not significantly different from most other angiosperms, so a comparison of hardwood and softwood chloroplasts becomes, in essence, a comparison of angiosperm and gymnosperm chloroplasts. Chloroplast DNA sequences are available for two gymnosperms, P. thunbergii (119 707 bp) and P. koraiensis (116 866 bp). Both genomes are significantly smaller than those of most angiosperms sequenced so far. Pairwise comparisons using Harr plots (Fig. 2c) and DOGMA software15 (data not shown) show that the chloroplast DNA sequences of the two pine species are very similar. In contrast, those same analytical techniques indicate that the chloroplast genomes of P. thunbergii and E. globulus are arranged very differently (Fig. 2d). Relative to Eucalyptus, rbcL and its neighboring regions in the LSC region are inverted in the pines, and a large region from the LSC, including psaA and psaB, occurs in the SSC.2 The rRNA genes from rrn16 to trnR-AGC that are in the inverted repeat in angiosperms form a cluster in the middle of the SSC in P. thunbergii.2 In addition to the 30 tRNA genes found in angiosperms, the two pine species have two unusual tRNAs, trnP-GGG and trnR-CCG. The first of these is also found in hornworts16 and ferns17, and trnR-CCG has been found in moss, although it is not essential for plastid function in moss and may not be a functional gene.18 Angiosperms and pines have the same suite of ribosomal protein genes, except that the pines lack rps16. Pines have an intact infA gene, in contrast to the pseudogene found in Eucalyptus and many other angiosperms (see above). In addition to the 29 genes encoding components of the photosynthetic apparatus in angiosperms, pines have 4 more genes that exist in some lower plants: psaM, chlB, chlL and chlN. The psaM gene (which is duplicated in the LSC of P. thunbergii,2 but not in P. koraiensis) has been found in non-vascular plants, but is absent from ferns and angiosperms, suggesting parallel losses in the latter two groups during their evolution.17 The genes chlB, chlL and chlN may be associated with the ability of pines to synthesize chlorophyll in the dark (as in Chlamydomonas19). A major difference in the gene content between pines and angiosperms is the complete absence of functional ndh genes from pine chloroplasts.2 It is unclear whether chloroplast ndh genes have been transferred to the nuclear genome of pines, or whether pine chloroplasts lack an NADH dehydrogenase altogether. Eucalyptus and Nicotiana have 21 introns, 5 more than P. thunbergii and P. koraiensis. Of these five, three occur in genes that are absent from pines (rps16, ndhA and ndhB), and two occur in clpP that, in pines, has no introns. The 16 remaining split genes are conserved between pines and angiosperms.2In conclusion, there does not appear to be any correlation between plant habit and plastome composition and arrangement. Differences between chloroplast genomes of tree and non-tree angiosperm species are slight. In contrast, although angiosperm and gymnosperm chloroplasts share many genes, there are significant differences in genome size, arrangement and gene content.The author thanks Peter Wilson and other staff at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF); Natalie Papworth and Alan McFadden (Royal Tasmanian Botanical Garden); Peter Boyer (SouthWind Writing and Publishing Services, Tasmania); Bob Elliott, Adam Smolenski, Natalie Conod, Rebecca Jones, Catherine Phillips, Briony Patterson, Gay McKinnon, Brad Potts and René Vaillancourt (University of Tasmania).

IntroductionRepetitive DNA consists of homopolymeric tracts of single nucleotides or of small or large numbers of multimeric classes of repeats. These can either be homogeneous (i.e. built from identical units) or heterogeneous (i.e. built from mixed units).1 A special category of repeats are tandem repeats, which are made up of monomeric sequences of variable length, repeated periodically, with contiguous monomers arranged in a head-to-tail fashion.2 The variability in repeat number of these small tandem repeats (also called simple sequence repeats or SSRs) is caused by slipped-strand mispairing, in which the tertiary structure of the repetitive DNA allows mismatching of the neighbouring repeats and repeats can then be inserted or deleted during DNA polymerase-mediated DNA duplication.1,3,4 Recently, an additional process, called indel slippage, was proposed.5,6 Unlike DNA replication slippage, this process is independent of the length of the repeat array and is thought to operate at repeats with few repetitions.Several functional roles have been proposed for SSRs. First of all, they are thought to be involved in various mechanisms of regulation of gene expression.1,2,4 It is thought that variation in SSR numbers can alter the spacing between structurally important domains (like the −35 and −10 promoter regions) and in this way can affect promoter strength.2 Differences in bending of the DNA molecule caused by unusual repeat structures can also affect promoter strength.7 Another example is the blocking of DNA replication elongation by transcription through SSRs.8 Second, the loss or gain of repeats can affect the integrity of ORFs (open reading frames) and can result in phase variation, in which shifting in and out of frame (relative to the start of translation) leads to on–off switching of the associated gene products.9 The observation of a high number of short close repeats in 296 Escherichia coli genes related to repair, recombination and physiological adaptations to different stresses suggests that these repeats may reflect a strategy to cope with stress.10 In addition, rearrangements between tandemly repeated sequences are a major source of genomic change as they can result in deletion or duplication of the DNA flanked by the repeated sequences11 and it has been shown that genomes containing a higher repeat density have higher rates of rearrangements leading to an accelerated loss of gene order.12 Finally, it has been shown that regions bordering SSR loci are more susceptible to mutagenic events.13It has been known for over 30 years that eukaryotic genomes contain a significant fraction of repeated sequences14–17 and SSRs have also been known to exist in prokaryotes for quite some time.3,18–21 Early analysis22 showed that nearly all SSRs were considerably overrepresented in genomic sequence fragments compared with that in their randomized counterparts; it also appeared that they were most frequent in eukaryotes and more rare in prokaryotes (probably due to more economical use of DNA, i.e. a higher coding density, in the latter). This was later confirmed by more in-depth analyses.20,21,23The increasing availability of prokaryotic genome sequences has shown that SSRs are also widespread in prokaryotes and that there is extensive variation in their length, number and distribution, in for example Escherichia coli, Shigella sp. and Ralstonia solanacearum.20,21,24–26 However, to date there are no studies which have systematically addressed and compared the distribution of SSRs in a large number of bacterial and/or archaeal genomes. Considering the potential importance of SSRs in generating genomic diversity and regulating gene expression, we determined the distribution of a specific group of SSRs, mononucleotide repeats (i.e. sequences consisting of a single repeated nucleotide) of size between 5 and 13 nt, in 157 sequenced prokaryotic genomes.2. Material and Methods2.1. DNA sequencesWe included the sequences of 157 prokaryotic genomes in the present study. These included 19 archaeal and 138 bacterial genomes (Tables 1 and 2). Most were downloaded from the GenBank database, but we also included a few unpublished genomes that were produced by the Pathogen Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute (Author Webpage) or the University of Oklahoma (Author Webpage).Overview of the archaeal genomes compared in the present study, the density of mononucleotide SSRs in the genome, the number of mononucleotide SSRs observed (O), the number of mononucleotide SSRs expected (based on base composition) (E) and the ratio O/E.Repeat density is shown as the percentage of the genome that is located in mononucleotide repeats >5 nt.Overview of the archaeal genomes compared in the present study, the density of mononucleotide SSRs in the genome, the number of mononucleotide SSRs observed (O), the number of mononucleotide SSRs expected (based on base composition) (E) and the ratio O/E.Repeat density is shown as the percentage of the genome that is located in mononucleotide repeats >5 nt.Overview of the bacterial genomes compared in the present study, the density of mononucleotide SSRs in the genome, the number of mononucleotide SSRs observed (O), the number of mononucleotide SSRs expected (based on base composition) (E) and the ratio O/E.Repeat density is shown as the percentage of the genome that is located in mononucleotide repeats >5 nt.aUnpublished genome sequences were produced by the Pathogen Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute (Author Webpage) (Bacteriovorax marinus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bordetella avium, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Chlamydophila abortus, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficile, Serratia marcescens and Yersinia enterocolitica) or the University of Oklahoma (Author Webpage) (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).Overview of the bacterial genomes compared in the present study, the density of mononucleotide SSRs in the genome, the number of mononucleotide SSRs observed (O), the number of mononucleotide SSRs expected (based on base composition) (E) and the ratio O/E.Repeat density is shown as the percentage of the genome that is located in mononucleotide repeats >5 nt.aUnpublished genome sequences were produced by the Pathogen Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute (Author Webpage) (Bacteriovorax marinus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bordetella avium, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Chlamydophila abortus, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficile, Serratia marcescens and Yersinia enterocolitica) or the University of Oklahoma (Author Webpage) (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).2.2. Determination of the number of mononucleotide SSRsWe used the software developed by Gur-Arie et al.24 to screen the entire genome of all organisms listed in Tables 1 and 2 for mononucleotide SSRs with a length between 5 and 13 bp and a minimal number of three repeats. This range was based on (i) the fact that SSRs >3 nt can engage in illegitimate recombination, (ii) the significant threshold for the length of SSR elements reported by Rocha et al.10 and (iii) the previous observations that larger repeats are rare in prokaryotes.24–26 In addition, when we noticed that mononucleotide repeats >13 nt were present, these were characterized as well. To determine the distribution of SSRs between coding and non-coding regions of the genome, all coding regions were extracted from the corresponding GenBank files and analysed separately.2.3. Calculation of the expected number of mononucleotide SSRsThe expected number of homo-oligomer tracts of t bases in a sequence of length N was calculated as given by De Wachter27: τ1,t=∑pit(1−pi)×[(N−t−1)(1−pi)+2] (summed over i = 1 − 4), with pi being the frequency of each base in the sequence. Considering the large number of genomes involved in this study, we did not perform permutation tests (i.e. did not count the number of mononucleotide SSRs in permutated genomes in order to assess statistical significance) but assessed deviations from the expected number of mononucleotide SSRs by representation plots.62.4. Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS 11.0.1. software (SPSS Inc.). Data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by applying Levene's test of homogeneity of variance. When appropriate for paired samples, t-tests were used. The correlation coefficients calculated included the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the non-parametric Spearman's (ρ) and Kendall's (T) correlation coefficients. Whenever appropriate, we also calculated partial correlation coefficients (i.e. the correlation that remains between two variables after removing the correlation that is due to their mutual association with another variable). We calculated the correlation between the number of mononculeotide SSRs, the mononucleotide SSR density, the ratio (R) between the observed (O) and expected (E) number of mononucleotide repeats and a number of other features of the genomes. These features included genome size, GC content, coding density, fraction of the genome located in duplicated segments and fraction of the genome located in horizontally transferred segments. The genome size, the GC content and the coding density were determined using Artemis 4.0.28 The number of putatively duplicated or horizontally transferred genes for each genome were taken from data published by Gevers et al.29 and Nakamura et al.,30 respectively.3. Results3.1. Number and density of mononucleotide SSRs in prokaryotic genomesAn overview of the total number of mononucleotide SSRs observed and the repeat density (expressed as percentage of the genome that is occupied by mononucleotide repeats) for archaeal and bacterial genomes are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For archaeal genomes, the number of mononucleotide SSRs with repeat size >5 nt ranged from 3797 (Methanopyrus kandleri) to 19 856 (Methanosarcina acetivorans). For bacterial genomes, the number of mononucleotide SSRs with repeat size >5 nt ranged from 2761 (Bifidobaterium longum) to 58 065 (Leptospira interrogans). The mononucleotide SSR density ranged from 0.0114% (Halobacterium sp.) to 0.0741% (Methanococcus maripaludis) for archaea, and from 0.0043% (Rhodopseudomonas palustris) to 0.1241% (Wigglesworthia glossinidia) for bacteria. There were no significant differences between archaea and bacteria with regard to number of SSRs (P = 0.211) or SSR density (P = 0.592).3.2. Length distribution of mononucleotide SSRsThe distribution of mononucleotide SSRs over different length categories was approximately the same in all prokaryotic genomes, with an almost linear or slightly sigmoid relationship between the logio of the number of repeats in a particular class and the size of the repeat unit of that class (Fig. 1). Deviations from this general model were most obvious for longer repeats, but this is most likely due to the small number of these larger repeats (data not shown). Complete tables with the exact number of observed and expected number of mononucleotide SSRs for each class are available as Supplementary Data (Table S1).Correlation between the number of mononucleotide SSRs in a given class and the repeat size.Correlation between the number of mononucleotide SSRs in a given class and the repeat size.3.3. Distribution of mononucleotide SSRs over coding and non-coding regionsNo clear general trend can be observed in the distribution of mononucleotide SSRs over coding and non-coding regions in archaeal (Fig. S1, available in Supplementary Data) and bacterial (Fig. 2) genomes. Nevertheless, there appears to be a tendency in the majority of the genomes to exclude longer mononucleotide SSRs from coding regions. Notable exceptions include the ɛ-Proteobacteria (including Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni), Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria meningitidis and Synechocystis sp., in which mononucleotide SSRs are almost exclusively located in coding regions, irrespective of length. The opposite is true for the genome of the [β-proteobacterium Chromobacterium violaceum: in this genome mononucleotide SSRs are almost exclusively located in non-coding regions, irrespective of the length of the repeat (Fig. 2)].Relationship between the size of the repeat unit and the % of mononucleotide SSRs found in coding regions in selected genomes of bacteria.Relationship between the size of the repeat unit and the % of mononucleotide SSRs found in coding regions in selected genomes of bacteria.3.4. Comparison between observed and expected number of mononucleotide repeatsWhen we compared the total number of mononucleotide repeat observed with the total number expected based on the equation proposed by De Wachter27, we found that the ratio of the observed number of repeats/expected number of repeats (R) was highly variable. In archaeal genomes, R ranged from 0.36 (Halobacterium sp.) to 2.42 (Methanosarcina acetivorans) (Table 1). In bacterial genomes, R ranged from 0.16 (Rhodopseudomonas palustris) to 3.51 (Helicobacter pylori J99) (Table 2). There was no significant difference in R values between archaea and bacteria (P = 0.686). Representation plots for mononucleotide SSRs in selected archaeal and bacterial genomes are shown in Fig. 3. We also observed that overall under- or overrepresentation does not necessarily mean that all types of mononucleotide SSRs are over- or underrepresented. This is illustrated by the representation plots for Helicobacter pylori J99 and Methanosarcina acetivorans: the total number of mononucleotide SSRs is much higher than expected by chance, but this is almost entirely due to the overrepresentation of smaller (<9 nt) repeats, as larger repeats are generally underrepresented or present in numbers that are close to the expected numbers (Fig. 3). An overview of the expected number of repeats for each individual repeat class, as well as the R-value for each repeat class is presented in Table S1.Representation plots for mononucleotide SSRs (size between 5 and 13 nt) in selected archaeal and bacterial genomes. x-axis: size of the repeat, y-axis: number of repeats observed and number of repeats expected.Representation plots for mononucleotide SSRs (size between 5 and 13 nt) in selected archaeal and bacterial genomes. x-axis: size of the repeat, y-axis: number of repeats observed and number of repeats expected.3.5. Presence of longer mononucleotide SSRs in prokaryotic genomesSixty prokaryotic genomes (5 archaeal and 55 bacterial genomes) investigated contained mononucleotide repeats >13 nt (Table S2, available in Supplementary Data). The total number of mononucleotide SSRs >13 nt ranged from 1 (24 genomes) to 24 (Helicobacter hepaticus). The largest mononucleotide SSRs are found in the genome of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, containing a poly(A) mononucleotide SSR of 54 nt and one of 58 nt. Only in 18 genomes, one or more of these longer mononucleotide SSRs were located in coding regions (Table S2). The maximum number of longer mononucleotide SSRs located in coding regions was five (in Helicobacter hepaticus and Helicobacter pylori 26695). The longest mononucleotide SSR located in a coding region is the 22 nt poly(G) repeat in the Pirelulla sp. genome. There was no significant difference in the number of long mononucleotide repeats between archaea and bacteria (P = 0.207).3.6. Correlation between number of mononucleotide SSRs and other genome parametersPearson correlation coefficients between number of mononucleotide SSRs in a genome, repeat density, the ratio observed/expected number of mononucleotide SSRs, genome size and GC content are shown in Table S3 (available in Supplementary Data). Similar trends were observed when we calculated the non-parametric Spearman and Kendall correlations (data not shown). From these data, it appears that the number of mononucleotide SSRs is weakly correlated with genome size and more strongly, but negatively, correlated with GC content. The repeat density and R are both negatively correlated with genome size and GC content. Graphical representations of the relationship between a number of variables investigated are shown in Fig. 4. However, genome size and GC content are correlated, as larger genomes tend to be more GC-rich and smaller genomes tend to be more AT-rich (see also Table S3).31 For that reason, we calculated partial correlations between a number of variables while removing the influence caused by the relation between genome size and GC content. We found that the number of mononucleotide SSRs observed correlated well with genome size (r2 = 0.6741, P < 0.001) and GC content (r2 = −0.7301, P < 0.001). The repeat density correlated very well with the GC content (r2 = −0.7712, P < 0.001), while the relation between repeat density and genome size was less pronounced (r2 = −0.2260, P = 0.005). The correlation between R and GC content was also high (r2 = −0.5761, P < 0.001), but no significant correlation was detected between R and genome size following the correction for the confounding effect of GC content. These data show that (i) larger genomes contain more mononucleotide SSRs than smaller genomes with the same GC content, (ii) larger genomes have a lower mononucleotide SSR density than smaller genomes with the same GC content, (iii) genomes with a high GC content contain less mononucleotide SSRs (and thus have a lower mononucleotide SSR density) than similar-sized genomes with a low GC content, and (iv) genomes with high GC content have a lower R value (i.e. contain less mononucleotide SSRs than expected) than similar-sized genomes with a low GC content. Also, the higher the mononucleotide SSR density, the larger the R value, meaning the larger the deviation from expected total number of mononucleotide SSRs.Correlation between a number of variables investigated.Correlation between a number of variables investigated.We also investigated the correlation between the observed and the expected mononucleotide SSR density and the GC content. As can be seen from Fig. S2 (available in Supplementary Data), there is a strong relationship between the GC content and the expected repeat density. This can be explained by the fact that, as the GC content shifts away from 50%, the four-letter nucleotide alphabet changes towards a two-letter alphabet, thereby increasing the probability of repeated sequences.32 However, we see that there is an entirely different relationship between the GC content and the actual observed mononucleotide SSR density (Fig. S2).In addition, we calculated correlations between number and density of mononucleotide SSRs and R, and the fraction of the genome located in duplicated segments and in horizontally transferred segments. Following correction for genome size (as the fraction of duplicated genes in a genome correlates positively with genome size29), no correlation between number and density of mononucleotide SSRs and R, and the fraction of duplicated genes in the genome could be observed. However, we found a significant negative relationship between the fraction of the genome localized in putatively horizontally transferred genes and SSR density (r2 = −0.592, P < 0.001). This correlation remained highly significant after correcting for the confounding effect of genome size (larger genomes tend to contain a higher fraction of putatively horizontally transferred genes30) (r2 = −0.4130, P < 0.001) (Fig. 5).Correlation between mononucleotide SSR density and the fraction of putatively horizontally transferred genes.Correlation between mononucleotide SSR density and the fraction of putatively horizontally transferred genes.3.7. Correlation between the mean GC content of mononucleotide SSRs, the mean GC content of the genome and repeat densityThe relationship between genomic GC content and the mean GC content of mononucleotide SSRs in a given genome is shown in Fig. S3 (available in Supplementary Data). This relationship is best described by a least-squares fit with the following equation: GCSSR = 2E−07 (GCgenome)4.6365 (r2 = 0.899). Our data clearly show that there is a tremendous overrepresentation of A and T in mononucleotide SSRs in AT-rich genomes (i.e. genomes in which the GC content is <50 mol%), while G and C are only overrepresented in a few GC-rich genomes (GC content >65 mol%). The relationship between repeat density and the mean GC content of mononucleotide SSRs in a given genome is also shown in Fig. S3. This relationship is best described by a least-squares fit with the following equation: GCSSR = 4890.7 (repeat density)−1.5515 (r2 = 0.695). This indicates that the GC content of mononucleotide SSRs is highest when the repeat density is lowest.4. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the presence of mononucleotide SSRs in sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The data obtained in the present study show that (i) a large number of mononucleotide SSRs is present in all prokaryotic genomes investigated (belonging both to the bacteria and to the archaea), (ii) shorter repeats are much more abundant than longer repeats, and (iii) in the majority of the genomes, longer mononucleotide SSRs are excluded from coding regions (although there are several exceptions to this general rule). Bacterial genomes that contain much less (i.e. R < 0.5) mononucleotide SSRs than expected are generally larger (mean genome size = 5 505 212 bp) and more GC-rich (mean GC content = 66.4 mol%), while bacterial genomes that contain much more (i.e. R > 2.0) mononucleotide SSRs than expected are in general smaller (average genome size = 2 254 190 bp) and more AT-rich (average GC content = 39.3 mol%) (the average genome size for all bacterial genomes = 3 336 435 bp, average GC-content = 46.6%). We also noted that genomes that contain a high fraction of horizontally transferred genes, in general have a lower mononucleotide SSR density.It is now generally accepted that SSRs, through a variety of molecular processes, are involved in generating genomic and phenotypic diversity in eukaryotes as well as in prokaryotes. Our analyses performed on a large number of prokaryotic genomes clearly indicate that, due to the presence of this large number of mononucleotide SSRs, prokaryotes have an enormous potential for generating this genomic and phenotypic diversity.Longer mononucleotide SSRs have more opportunity to undergo slipped-strand mispairing and there will be more mutability in their length than in shorter mononucleotide SSRs. This could help to explain why these are overrepresented in non-coding regions of the genome as selection has ample opportunity to operate against these larger repeats that would cause frameshift and non-sense mutations in coding regions. The observation that in some genomes (including the genomes of the ɛ-Proteobacteria Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter hepaticus, Wolinella succinogenes, and those of Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria meningitidis and Synechocystis sp.) larger mononucleotide SSRs are not (or to a lesser extent) excluded from coding regions, suggest they may play an important role in phase variation33 as this process has been observed in these organisms.9,34–36Interestingly, we also observed that the repeat density was significantly higher (one-way ANOVA, P < 0.001) in organisms with an intracellular or strictly parasitic lifestyle (including Brucella spp., Treponema spp., Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Mesoplasma florum, Phytoplasma asteris, Coxiella burnettii, Wigglesworthia glossinidia, Buchnera aphidicola and Blochmannia floridanus) (see Table 2). This seems to be contradicting the consistent genome reduction observed in most of these organisms (e.g. there are no repeated sequences >200 bp in members of the genus Buchnera37). For at least some of these organisms (e.g. Buchnera species), this probably can be attributed to the loss of genes involved in DNA repair functions,38,39 as it has been shown that the loss of DNA polymerase proofreading activity or post-replication mismatch repair can greatly enhance the rate of SSR tract alterations.3,40,41 However, other intracellular bacteria do contain proofreading activity, so most probably other (as yet unidentified) factors are involved as well.Besides their likely involvement in phase variation, variation in mononucleotide SSR length at or near regulatory elements can have a significant influence on gene expression by affecting the binding of regulatory proteins, the distance between regulatory elements, the bendability, coiling, packaging and phasing of the DNA, or the formation of unusual DNA structures.24,42–44 In contrast to phase variation, these processes can affect gene expression in a more subtle, quantitative way.42,45 Computer simulations performed by King and co-workers46,47 have shown that the mutational properties of SSRs could be exploited by evolving populations. The mutation rate in populations which are under selection pressure (e.g. imposed by gradually changing environmental conditions) can increase as an indirect consequence of selection. When mutations are suitably constrained, frequent mutations allow the population to adapt efficiently. In this light, it has been hypothesized that SSRs have become frequent because selection has favoured their intrinsic instability, which allows them to work as ‘adjustable tuning knobs’ that facilitate the process of evolutionary change.46 The large differences between expected and observed number of mononucleotide SSRs could be attributable to the presence of alternative mechanisms for generating diversity in genomes with a low number of mononucleotide SSRs. The observation that there is a significant negative correlation between the fraction of the genome localized in putatively horizontally transferred genes and mononucleotide SSR density fits into this hypothesis as well.We would like to point out that the number of putatively horizontally transferred genes for each genome were taken from data published by Nakamura et al.30 In this study, putatively horizontally transferred genes were identified by a Bayesian method based on differences in nucleotide composition. While this method has several advantages over more direct phylogenetic methods, a disadvantage is that it may preferentially detect recent horizontally transferred genes, while anciently transferred genes may be indistinguishable because the nucleotide composition of the transferred gene is converging with that of the recipient genome by mutational pressure (a process called ‘amelioration’48). It will be interesting to see whether the intriguing relationship between the fraction of the genome localized in putatively horizontally transferred genes and SSR density holds up if more ancient horizontal gene transfer events are taken into account.The overrepresentation of A and T in mononucleotide SSRs in the majority of prokaryotic genomes might be explained by the fact that slipped-strand mispairing is more likely for poly(A) or poly(T) repeats, as strand separation for these polynucleotides is energetically favourable compared with strand separation of poly(C) or poly(G) repeats. It is thus easier to generate variability with poly(A) and poly(T) mononucleotide SSRs than with poly(C) or poly(G) repeats. This is confirmed by the observation that the loss of DNA polymerase proofreading activity or post-replication mismatch repair specifically enhances the rate of poly (A) tract alterations.49 However, our data also clearly indicate that the GC content of mononucleotide SSRs is highest when the repeat density is lowest. This suggest that there could be other reasons for the tremendous overrepresentation of poly(A) and poly(T) mononucleotide SSRs. It has been suggested that the higher energy cost of G and C over A and T/U could be the reason for the high variation seen in genomic G+C content.31,50 Indeed, the synthesis of GTP requires an additional NAD compared with AMP, while the synthesis of CTP from UTP requires an additional ATP molecule.50 In addition, due to its central role in metabolism, ATP is abundantly present in the cell. The observation that more GC-rich mononucleotide SSRs are predominantly found in genomes with a low mononucleotide SSR density suggest that the same underlying reason might be responsible for the marked differences observed in G+C content of these mononucleotide SSRs, as it would be too costly to have many poly(G) and/or poly(C) SSRs in genomes with a high density of mononucleotide SSRs. This hypothesis is corroborated by the observation that the G+C content of mononucleotide SSRs of intracellular bacteria is extremely low (i.e. the mononucleotide SSRs of these organisms are—just like the rest of the genome50—more AT-rich as a result of selection by competition for scarce resources). Another possible reason is the involvement of repeated sequences in the formation of non-canonical DNA structures, including triple-stranded H-DNA. These structures are more easily formed in GA-rich regions51,52 and could block transcription by RNA polymerase.53 As such, the presence of many G (or A) mononucleotide SSRs in bacteria with a high GC content would result in a selective disadvantage.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available online at Author Webpage and at Author Webpage or can be requested from Tom Coenye.T.C. and P.V. are indebted to the Fund for Scientific Research—Flanders (Belgium) for the position as postdoctoral fellow and research grants, respectively.

Keeping this in view we isolate the discriminating features of all archaeal tRNA. These are our identity elements. Further, we investigate tRNA-characteristics that delineate the different orders of Archaea.1. IntroductionTransfer RNA (tRNA) genes form the single largest gene family. The yeast tRNAAla was the first to be sequenced.1 tRNA consists of ∼76 nucleotides. They are found in cytoplasm, as well as in mitochondria and chloroplast.2,3 We deal with cytoplasmic tRNA genes of Archaea.4 As of now, several powerful tRNA gene identification routines5–11 are accessible. tRNA sequence databases12,13 have grown. Archaeal tRNA genes have introns. Some introns occur at what are called canonical (i.e. between 37 and 38) sites. Introns appear at non-canonical sites (sites other than canonical) as well. The introns at non-canonical sites vary in size and number. These non-canonical introns make the detection of tRNA genes tricky. The present tRNA gene identification routines sometimes cannot sort out these introns. Consequently, some tRNA genes are embedded (Author Webpage), some missed or misidentified, e.g. Nanoarchaeum equitans. The present routines8,11 do not get tRNATrp(CCA). Instead it gets a second copy of tRNASer(CGA) lying between nucleotides 151 992 and 152 081. We find this to be a misidentification (Author Webpage). We infer that the nucleotides between 151 992 and 152 078 constitute tRNATrp(CCA) gene. It has a non-canonical intron, 13 bases long, between positions 30 and 31 of tRNATrp(CCA) gene. Again, the present routines miss tRNAiMet(CAT) gene in N. equitans; we find that it is located between nucleotides 35 249 and 35 429 with two non-canonical introns. For archaeal tRNA genes there are a few such cases. In this paper we address the identity elements (for recognition of cognate amino acids) in cytoplasmic tRNAs of Archaea.In this study, we have analyzed 22 species of 12 orders of three phyla of Archaea [the sequences deposited at DDBJ (Author Webpage), NCBI, DOGAN (Author Webpage) and Microbial Genome Database (MGBD) at Author Webpage] including the recent phylum Nanoarchaeota and recently sequenced Picrophilus torridus. Out of these 22 species, 3 species whose sequencing are not yet completed, but the draft genome sequence is deposited by DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) (Author Webpage) are also taken for analysis. These three draft sequence are of M. barkeri and M. burtonii (Methanosarcinales) and F. acidarmanus (Thermoplasmatales).Table 1 lists the Archaea and the abbreviations used to denote them. The other notations used in this paper are as follows: (i) tRNATrp(CCA) means tryptophan tRNA with anticodon, CCA; (ii) G1:C72 means base pairing between first nucleotide and 72nd nucleotide of tRNA. The abbreviation bp stands for base pair/base pairs. Semi-conserved bases are the ones that are conserved with but a few exceptions. 3D bp means three-dimensional base pairings. These are essential for tertiary structure.Various features of 22 species of Archaea.PM means plasma membrane.adenotes the draft genomes whose whole genome sequencing is going on.Various features of 22 species of Archaea.PM means plasma membrane.adenotes the draft genomes whose whole genome sequencing is going on.The primary tRNA nucleotide chain is single stranded. This chain folds back onto itself to form the base paired secondary structure. This folded cloverleaf structure confers on tRNA some of its functions. The secondary structure of tRNA14 has (i) Acceptor arm or A-arm: In this, the 5′ and 3′ ends of tRNA are base paired into a stem of 7 bp. (ii) DHU arm or D-Arm: Structurally a stem-loop, D-arm frequently contains the modified base dihydrouracil. (iii) Anticodon arm or AC-arm, made of a stem and a loop containing the anticodon. The canonical structure of AC-loop is essential for interactions with ribosomal A and P sites.15 At 5′ end of this loop is a pyrimidine base at 32, followed by an invariant U at 33. The anticodon triplet, at 34, 35, 36 is in the exposed loop region.13 (iv) Extra arm, or V-arm: This arm is not always present. It is of variable length and is largely responsible for variations in the lengths of tRNAs. The classification of tRNAs into types I and II depends on the length of V-arm. (v) T-ψ-C Arm or T-arm: This arm has conserved sequence of three ribonucleotides: ribothymidine, pseudouridine and cytosine. T-arm has stem–loop secondary structure and (vi) tRNA terminates with CCA at the 3′ end.16 For tRNA genes, CCA may not be present. In case CCA is absent in tRNA genes, it is added during the maturation to tRNA.The attachment of cognate amino acids to their corresponding tRNA are catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS).17 Accurate acylation of tRNA depends on two factors: a set of nucleotides in tRNA molecule (identity elements) responsible for proper identification by AARS18–21 and competition between different synthetases for tRNAs.22–25 Tertiary L-shape of tRNA facilitates its identification by AARS for aminoacylation.26 L-shape comes about through the interactions between D-arm and T-arm. There are a few key features that maintain the L-shape of tRNA.27,28 These interactions include Watson–Crick base pairing, Hoogsteen base pairing, and triple-helical base pairing. It is generally accepted that the major interactions maintaining the L-shape occur at the corner of the molecule where D- and T-loops meet. This region, called DT, contains several elements, including the reverse-Hoogsteen base pair U54:A58 and C55-mediated U-turn in T-loop, the inter-loop base pairs G18:C55 and G19:C56 and stack of four mutually intercalated purine bases A58–G18–R57–G19.29,30 This intraloop U54:A58 is stacked on G53.C61 at the end of T stem and forces the two bases at positions 59 and 60 to loop out, forming a characteristic T-loop of five bases instead of seven. This characteristic T loop conformation is important for recognition by elongation factors.31 We propose here all possible identity elements in tRNAs of Archaea for recognition of cognate amino acids. These are bases within tRNA sequences with which it would be possible to identify each of the tRNAs of individual archaeal species of different taxonomic groups.From the 22 archaeal genomes, we sourced 1001 tRNA genes in total. We located tRNA genes using our in-house algorithm. Subsequently, we ran tRNAScan-SE and ARAGORN as additional checks.2. Materials and MethodsThe archaeal genomes are obtained from NCBI and Genome Information Broker (Author Webpage). Raw tRNA gene sequences are found by searching the different motifs present in the consensus sequence of different tRNAs genes of Archaea. At first we adopted the standard cloverleaf model1 for studying the secondary structure of predicted tRNA genes of Archaea. In doing so, we got some false positives and a few tRNA genes were missed out. We then imposed constraints, unique to archaeal tRNA genes. A regular cloverleaf structure was searched in tRNA genes of the genomes by adopting archaeal tRNA gene features. The constraints of lengths of stems of regular tRNA A-arm, D-arm, AC-arm and T-arm are 7, 4, 5 and 5 bp, respectively. In a few cases, the length of D-arm and AC-arm are relaxed. In addition, parameters and constraints used in the search for cloverleaf tRNAs are the following: (i) T8 (except Y8 in M. kandleri), G18, R19, R53, Y55 and A58 are considered as conserved bases for Archaea. (ii) The lengths of introns and V-arm are allowed from 6 to 121 and up to 21, respectively. (iii) Positions optionally occupied in D-loop are 17, 17a, 20a and 20b. (iv) Canonical and non-canonical introns may or may not be present. Keeping these constraints, we were able to extract tRNA genes in all Archaea. (Number of tRNA genes obtained are given in Table 1). After getting the tRNA genes we ran the standard routines8,11 to check for the secondary structure.3. Results and DiscussionTable 2 lists the conserved and semi-conserved bases/base pairs of various archaeal elongator tRNAs. In Table 3 we list the following identity elements.Conserved and semi-conserved bases/base pairs of various Archaeal elongator tRNAs.Conserved and semi-conserved bases/bp are marked in black and red font respectively.Dashed lines (colour indication is same as above) indicate no base pairing.**denotes interchange of GC and CG bp at a particular bp position.Conserved and semi-conserved bases/base pairs of various Archaeal elongator tRNAs.Conserved and semi-conserved bases/bp are marked in black and red font respectively.Dashed lines (colour indication is same as above) indicate no base pairing.**denotes interchange of GC and CG bp at a particular bp position.Identity elements of Archaeal tRNAs.Met is for initiator tRNA and eMet is for elongator methionine tRNA.Identity elements of Archaeal tRNAs.Met is for initiator tRNA and eMet is for elongator methionine tRNA.(i) tRNAAla. G3:U70 is a unique base pair in archaeal tRNAAla. Ala-RS specifically aminoacylates tRNAAla because of direct recognition of unique functional groups exposed on G3:U70. The G3:U70 pair contributes to tRNAAla identity by three mechanisms. First, the wobble pair presents a distinctive array of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in major and minor grooves. Second, unusual structural features induced by the G3:U70 pair may influence Ala-RS binding to AC-stem and/or 3′-CCA end of tRNAAla. Third, G3:U70 may destabilize AC-end and favor the formation of an optimal active site geometry by induced fit.51 These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. The role of the functional groups in minor groove of A-stem on recognition and aminoacylation by Ala-RS has been extensively investigated.52 A73 discriminator base could be another identity element.(ii) tRNAArg. 1:72 of tRNAArg is conserved for Archaea, except A:U for tRNAArg(CCG) of MmGoe, Macet and Mbar. The third base of anticodon G36 or U36 and the second anticodon base C35 are arginine identities. A20 and the discriminator base A73 or G73 are identity elements as well. Nanoarchaea has U20 and A59. These unusual nucleotide positions may be identity elements for tRNAArg of Nanoarchaea.(iii) tRNAAsn. Methanosarcinales have unique A10:U25 unlike G10:C25 in other Archaea. Similarly, all three Thermococcales (Pf, Paby and Phori) and Afulg, all hyperthermophiles, have U13:G22 in tRNAAsn. Other Archaea have C13:G22. For archaeal tRNAAsn, we find that C3:G70, G73 and G34, U35, U36 are the identity elements.(iv) tRNAAsp. G4:C69 is characteristic of Crenarchaea which distinguishes it from Euryarchaea that have C4:G69 (exceptions: C4:G69 for Paero and U4:A69 in Pitor). Methanosarcinales differ at U2:G71 from C2:G71 in other Archaea. We surmise G6:C67 to be the identity determinant recognized by synthetase in addition to other identity elements of tRNAAsp in its anticodon, G34, U35 and C36.(v) tRNACys. Thermoplasmales differs from other archaeal order at G2:C71 and A3:U70. Others have CG at these two positions. tRNACys(GCA) of Nanoarchaea differs from two other archaeal phyla at C10:G25. The two other phyla have G10:C25.(vi) tRNAGln. C12:G23 in D-stem of Crenarchaea is a distinguishing feature of tRNAGln from G12:C23 of Euryarchaea. A at 73rd position is the discriminator base, with exception of tRNAGln(UUG) of Facid where G is the discriminator. The other identity elements of tRNAGln could be A1:U72 in addition to anticodon bases at 34th, 35th and 36th positions. The modified U base at 34th nucleotide could be the major identity element for the synthetase as in E.coli.53(vii) tRNAGlu. The 3D bp 15:48 is GC, but tRNAGlu(UUC) of Mkan has CC at this position. The Sulfolobales and Desulfurococcales tRNAGlu differ from all Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea with G4:C69 from C4:G69 in all others. U34, U35 and C36 are identity elements for Archaea as in Escherichia coli. 54,55 C5:G68 could be another identity element for archaeal tRNAGlu.(viii) tRNAGly. Nanoarchaea is unique at 33rd site in its tRNAGly. It has pyrimidine C in tRNAGly(CCC) rather than U as in other two phyla. A73 acts as an identity element in addition to C35, C36.(ix) tRNAHis. Methanococcales, Methanosarcinales and Thermoplasmales have G7:U66 not observed in other Archaea. Paero has UA at 11:24 unlike other Crenarchaea where it is CG. The discriminator base C73, the fourth unpaired base from the tRNA 3′ end are the characteristic features of tRNAHis(GUG). These are the identity elements in addition to the anticodon. C50:G64 could be an additional identity element. G29:C41 could be a minor identity element as well.(x) tRNAIle. Nanoarchaea unusually have tRNAIle(UAU) and tRNAIle (GAU) which differ from each other at 29:41, 31:39 and 49:65 with interchange of GC or CG. The first one (i.e. tRNAIle(UAU)) located between bases 225 624 and 225 716 has an intron unlike the second and it is the first tRNAIle(UAU) to be identified in Archaea. The two tRNAIle(GAU) of Macet are identical and have 3′-CCA arm. C27:G43 is presumably the identity element for tRNAIle(GAU). In addition, the anticodon and A73 are identity elements.(xi) tRNALeu. MmGoe, Macet and Mburt have six tRNALeu with two identical copies of tRNALeu(GAG). The two copies of tRNALeu(GAG) gene of MmGoe are identical, but differ by CCA arm in one of them. A5:U68 is characteristic of tRNALeu of Thermoplasmales, except GC in tRNALeu(UAA). We surmise that G26:U44 is the discriminating factor (Table 3).(xii) tRNALys. Hyperthermophilic Desulfurococcales have C32:C38; but other Archaea have CA. The discriminator bases G73 and U35 are the acceptor identities for tRNALys as in E coli. 56,57(xiii) tRNAeMet (Elongator methionine tRNA). Two elongator tRNAMet(CAU) differ from one another at two positions. The first copy, tRNAeMet1(CAU) has CG at 2:71 and 3:70 of A-arm and the second tRNAeMet2(CAU) has GC at these positions. tRNAeMet1(CAU) of most of the Euryarchaea have canonical introns, but rare in its second copy. C34, A35 and U36 could be the identity elements in addition to the discriminator base A73.(xiv) tRNAiMet(CAU) (Initiator methionine tRNA). Interestingly, Mmari, MmGoe, Macet have two copies of tRNAiMet(CAU). G28:C42 in Crenarchaeal tRNAiMet(CAU) distinguishes it from either CG or UG at this position in Euryarchaea. Mkan is again an exception in this respect where G28:C42 is present as in Crenarchaea. tRNAiMet of Halo is characterized by A7:U66 in contrast to G7:C66 in other Archaea.Archaeal tRNAiMet(CAU) possesses unique sequence characteristics: (a) A1:U72 bp at the beginning of A-arm, (b) the three consecutive G and three C at the bottom of AC-stem forming GC bp in tRNAiMet(CAU) of Euryarchaea similar to bacteria.58 Four consecutive GC bps in Crenarchaeal tRNAiMet unlike bacteria and eukaryotes. (c) G11:C24 in D- stem in contrast to C11:G24 in elongator tRNAs, (d) UA/AU bps at 51:63 in T-stem in contrast to GC for elongator tRNAs in all Archaea. The identity elements for tRNAiMet are listed in Table 3.(xv) tRNAPhe(GAA). Crenarchaeal tRNAPhe(GAA) differs from Euryarchaea at C6:G67 against G6:C67 for Euryarchaea. Exception: halophilic tRNAPhe(GAA) are similar at 6:67 to Crenarchaea. C13:G22, we conjecture is an identity element. In addition to this, anticodon and A73 are identity elements.(xvi) tRNAPro. Nanoarchaea has G10:C25. It is G10:U25 in Euryarchaea and either G10:C25 or G10:U25 in Crenarchaea. tRNAPro of Mther has A7:U66 in tRNAPro(UGG) which discriminate it from tRNAPro(UGG) of all other Archaea, where G7:C66 is observed. The three GC bps at 5′ end of A-arm and A73 are the most probable regions for tRNA recognition for tRNAPro and G36 is a major determinant for aminoacylation, as reported for Mjan.59 In addition to aminoacylation of tRNAPro by ProRS, this AARS has a dual function of aminoacylating tRNACys in Mjan, Mmari and Mther.60(xvii) tRNASer. 6:67 is GC in Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea, but Nanoarchaea has CG. The present routines8,11 get a second copy of tDNASer(CGA) in N. equitans lying between neclotides 151 992 and 152 081. We find that this is a misidentification and explained in detail in tRNATrp(CCA) section. We find for archaeal tRNASer G26:U44 can contribute to its recognition by Ser-RS. G73 and V-loop act as identity elements as in E. coli tRNASer.61(xviii) tRNAThr. Thermococcales have conserved C12:G23 in tRNAThr(CGU) and tRNAThr(UGU) distinguishing these from other Euryarchaeal tRNAThr that have UA. For tRNAThr(UGU),31:39 bp differentiate between Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea; these have CG (exception: Paero has A:U) and AU respectively. U73, discriminator base is involved in recognition by Thr-RS in Archaea.62 Second and third letters of anticodon, G35 and U36 are identity elements of archaeal Thr-RS as well.(xix) tRNATrp(CCA). Tryptophan is a single codon amino acid and Archaea have at least one tRNATrp(CCA). The current standard routines8,11 could not identify tRNATrp(CCA) in Nanoarchaea and we are able to identify it. The current standard routines identify the bases from 151 992 and 152 081 in Nanoarchaea as being tRNASer(CGA). We argue now that the bases between 151 992 and 152 081 are unlikely to be tRNASer(CGA). The reasons are as follows In tRNASer it is known that G26:U44, G73 and the elements in long V-arm are important for recognition by Ser-RS.63 None of these recognition bases appear between 151 992 and 152 081. Instead we get G26:A44, A73 and a short V-arm.Variable arm for tRNASer is known to be long.61 If we identify 151 992–152081 to be tRNASer(CGA), it is going to have a short V-arm missing out the elements important for its recognition by Ser-RS.However, the secondary structure generated from 151 992 to 152 078 have the following important positions G1, G2, G3, A21, T33, A73, G18:T55, G19:C56, T54:A58 and G30:C40 and anticodon CCA at 34, 35 and 36. These are known to be conserved in archaeal tRNATrp(CCA). Therefore, the range 151992–152078 is tRNATrp(CCA) gene. It has a non-canonical intron, 13 base-long between 30 and 31. It has BHB splicing motif as well.U12:A23 in Crenarchaea distinguishes it from either GC or CG in Euryarchaea. The ninth base discriminates between Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea; the former have A and the latter have G. The anticodons C34, C35 and A36 are recognized by Trp-RS.64 Additionally, A73 could also be the identity element.(xx) tRNATyr. tRNATyr(GUA) of Archaea have characteristic base pairs at 31:39:GC bias in Crenarchaea and AU bias in Euryarchaea. The Methanosarcinales have unique AU, the first base pair of D-stem, that differentiate these from tRNATyr(GUA) of all other Archaea where GC is present. Base pair 2:71 is CG in general, but it is GC in Paero. G50:C64 of Nanoarchaea show identity with Crenarchaea and not with Euryarchaea where C50:G64 is present. The first base pair, CG in the A-arm is unique to tRNATyr(GUA) and absent in other tRNA. This base pair is an identity element of tRNATyr(GUA) for Tyr-RS in addition to the anticodons. This observation is experimentally supported in Mjan.65(xxi) tRNAVal. MmGoe, Macet and Mbar have two identical copies of tRNAVal(GAC). UA is present at 4:69 in tRNAVal of Halo and in tRNAVal(GAC) of Mmari, but all other Archaea have CG. For archaeal tRNAVal, the second and third nucleotides of anticodon, A35, C36 and the conserved, unique base pair of U11:A24 could be the identity elements for recognition by Val-RS. Additionally, the discriminator base A73 could be another identity element.Introns in archaeal tRNA genesA unique feature of archaeal tRNA genes is their ability to occasionally host introns at locations other than the usual position within the anticodon loop (between bases 37 and 38) of tRNA genes.

Introns at canonical positions are located by existing software (tRNAScan-SE and ARAGORN). Identification of non-canonical introns in archaeal tRNA genes continues to be a challenge.

IntroductionArabidopsis thaliana is a model plant for studying developmental processes, responses to stress and signal transduction. In 2000, its whole genomic sequence consisting of ∼26 000 genes was determined.1 A genome-wide comparative analysis of transcription factors in Arabidopsis, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Riechmann et al.2 revealed that the Arabidopsis genome codes for ∼1500 transcription factors. This is ∼6% of the total genes, which is a higher percentage than that in either D. melanogaster, C. elegans or S. cerevisiae. These transcription factors often have separate roles for different developmental stages, tissues or stress responses.3–5 Identification of the transcription factors is essential for understanding the life system of Arabidopsis. Owing to the success of full-length cDNA projects,6–8 the annotation of gene structures has been greatly improved, and the information of all transcription factors needs to be updated based on the new gene annotation. Furthermore, some novel transcription factor families have been identified after the report by Riechmann et al.9–18 A new transcription factor database incorporating accumulated information on upstream regulatory sequences of genes, alternative pre-mRNA splicing events, transposon-tagged mutant lines and so on is needed. In this study, we first searched for the transcription factors with using PSI-BLAST.19 Riechmann et al.2 classified the transcription factors in Arabidopsis into ∼30 families. Homology search tools or motif search tools such as BLAST19 or InterProScan20 are commonly used to search for protein family members by amino acid sequence similarities. Although these algorithms are very useful, none of them are perfect. PSI-BLAST is a powerful algorithm in the search for protein families based on amino acid sequence similarities. With PSI-BLAST, we can search for similar sequences from the database using the position-specific score matrix (PSSM). PSSM places more weight on highly conserved sites. Because transcription factors often have highly conserved DNA-binding domains, we expected to identify all the transcription factors with high sensitivity and specificity from all protein sequences of Arabidopsis with PSI-BLAST. To construct a proper set of Arabidopsis transcription factors, we also used InterProScan and checked for several transcription factor families manually. Finally, we obtained 1968 transcription factors. Based on the transcription factors identified, we constructed a new Arabidopsis transcription factor database named RARTF. We provide the list and the information on all Arabidopsis transcription factors from RARTF.2. Materials and Methods2.1. DatasetsWe used amino acid sequences of all predicted Arabidopsis proteins released from MAtDB (MIPS A. thaliana Genome Database) of MIPS (Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences, , v110103).21 In addition, we used amino acid sequences of a bZIP transcription factor, AREB1 (AB017160), not annotated by the MIPS protein entry code. We used 26 594 protein sequences in total.2.2. Identification of transcription factorsWe used the classification of transcription factor families reported by Riechmann et al.2 We added another 12 families as novel transcription factor families of Arabidopsis to this classification.9–18 To find novel transcription factor families, we used PubMed (Author Webpage).We chose one representative sequence for each transcription factor family or subfamily. We used the sequence in table 3 of Riechmann et al.2 when the accession number was found, and we selected a protein sequence which had the InterPro22 motif of each transcription factor family when not. We used these representative sequences as query sequences for the PSI-BLAST search. We used the reported sequences for the 12 novel transcription factor families. We used the entire amino acid sequence of each representative transcription factor for PSI-BLAST search except for ‘GARP, ARR-B class’ family (TF10_2). For this family, we selected the DNA-binding region for PSI-BLAST query. We used PSI-BLAST version 2.2.5 to identify the transcription factors from all Arabidopsis proteins. In the first step, we constructed PSSMs19 based on query sequences. The parameters we used were the maximum round of iteration (j) = 10, filter (F) = on, E-value threshold for iteration (h) = 0.0001, database (d) = amino acid sequences of all Arabidopsis proteins. In the next step, we searched for transcription factors with the constructed PSSMs. The parameters in the second step were E-value threshold (e) = 0.001, filter (F) = on. After the PSI-BLAST search, we used InterProScan for ‘C2H2-type zinc-finger’ family (TF_5_3) to complement PSI-BLAST search results. We performed a manual check for major Arabidopsis transcription factor families (MYB, AP2/EREBP, bHLH, NAC, MADS, bZIP, WRKY) and ‘PcG; Esc class’ transcriptional regulator family (TF_60). For check processes of major transcription factor families, we referred to the most recent papers.23–302.3. Validation of sensitivities and specificitiesWe validated pre-fixed PSI-BLAST search results on seven major transcription factor families: MYB, AP2/EREBP, bHLH, NAC, MADS, bZIP, WRKY. We calculated the sensitivities and specificities using the new corrected list we made for each transcription factor family based on the most recent papers,23–30 which we refer to as the ‘correct list’ hereafter. Sensitivity is calculated as [number of transcription factors identified in this study in the correct list]/[number of transcription factors in the correct list] = [True positive]/([true positive] + [false negative]). Specificity is calculated as [number of transcription factors identified in this study in the correct list]/[number of all transcription factors identified in this study] = [True positive]/([true positive] + [false positive]). For comparison, we searched transcription factors by BLAST19 and InterProScan.20 In the BLAST search, we used a parameter for E-value threshold (e) = 0.01 which revealed the best sensitivities and specificities within E-value = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001. In InterProScan search, we used IPR001005 motif (PS50090, PF00249, SM0071) for MYB family, IPR001471 motif (PF00847, PR00367, SM00380, PD001423) for AP2/EREBP family, IPR001092 motif (PS50888, SM00353, PF00010, SSF47459) for bHLH family, IPR003441 motif (PF02365) for NAC family, IPR002100 motif (PS50066, SM00432, PF00319, PR00404, SSF55455, PS00350) for MADS family, IPR004827 motif (PF00170, PS50217, PS00036, SM00338) for bZIP family, IPR003657 motif (PF03106, PS50811) for WRKY family. We used InterProScan version 3.3 and dataset version 7.2 with default parameters. We listed proteins that had motifs with a true decision or matched sequence pattern.2.4. Database constructionWe classified the transcription factors into families and subfamilies according to Riechmann et al.2 In each family or subfamily, we included transcription factors which were identified by PSI-BLAST search with one query sequence. As a result of PSI-BLAST search, we found that some transcription factors belonged to more than two families. To re-organize these transcription factors, we made two lists: the Phase 1 list includes all transcription factors obtained by the search using each query sequence, and the Phase 2 list gives the proteins detected with the smallest E-value. In the Phase 1 list, some transcription factors were annotated to more than two families. In the Phase 2 list, the transcription factor belonged to one family. In the Phase 2 list, there is no redundancy. Based on these two lists, we constructed the transcription factor database: RARTF, in which we related various contents based on AGI gene codes21 (Fig. 1).Data flow of identification of transcription factors and database construction in RARTF. In the first step, we constructed PSSMs for each transcription factor family.

Identification of transcription factorsWe analyzed 54 transcription factor families and 7 transcriptional regulator families according to Riechmann et al.2 We also analyzed 12 additional transcription factor families9–18 reported after 2000 (Table 1). Seventeen families had some subfamilies. We used 121 representative sequences of each family or subfamily. We chose representative sequences from Riechmann et al.2 or other reported novel transcription factors9–18 (see Materials and Methods). We used the entire amino acid sequence of representative proteins for PSI-BLAST search except for the ‘GARP, ARR-B class’ family (TF10_2). For ‘GARP, ARR-B class’ family, we chose the DNA-binding region for PSI-BLAST search to obtain much superior search results. Using these sequences as a query, we performed a PSI-BLAST19 search for all transcription factors in Arabidopsis (Fig. 1). We performed the PSI-BLAST search using as a parameter the maximum round of iteration set 10. With this parameter, converged results were obtained in 116 out of 121 cases. In two cases (TF_32 and TF_46), there was no significant hit on the first search round. Unconverged results were obtained in another three cases (TF_1_4, TF_17_2 and TF_22_1), and we manually checked them.Transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana.aNumber of transcription factors classified into each family.

This count is non-redundant within each family, but is redundant when compared with another family.In a preliminary analysis, we found it difficult to identify members belonging to the ‘C2H2-type zinc-finger’ family (TF_5) because there were a few conserved sites in this family and there were many gaps within their zinc-finger sequences. By a PSI-BLAST search of the proteins detected by InterProScan,20 we listed 171 proteins into TF_5_3. The preliminary analysis revealed another family in which many proteins were clearly not transcription factors, i.e. ‘PcG; Esc class’ transcriptional regulator family (TF_60). We selected three proteins from the 200 listed proteins in this group, by eye.The Arabidopsis genome has several large transcription factor families that have 100–200 members. These families have been well studied and are known to have important functions. Especially for these major transcription factor families, we compared the PSI-BLAST search results with recent publication. We referred to a review by Stracke et al.23 for the MYB family, Gutterson and Reuber24 in 2004 and Sakuma et al.25 in 2002 for the AP2/EREBP family, Bailey et al. in 200326 for the bHLH family, Ooka et al.27 in 2003 for the NAC family, Parenicova et al.28 for the MADS family, Jakoby et al.29 for the bZIP family and Ulker and Somssich in 200430 for the WRKY family. We found 15 false negatives and 38 false positives (Table 2). In each case, we checked their transcription factor lists and redescribed them with AGI codes of our dataset. We corrected our PSI-BLAST search results according to this check.Sensitivities and specificities of PSI-BLAST and other programs.aThe denominator represents no. of transcription factors in the correct list, the numerator represents no. of true positive.bThe denominator represents no. of true positive and false positive identified in this study, the numerator represents no. of true positive.Sensitivities and specificities of PSI-BLAST and other programs.aThe denominator represents no. of transcription factors in the correct list, the numerator represents no. of true positive.bThe denominator represents no. of true positive and false positive identified in this study, the numerator represents no. of true positive.We added AREB1 (accession number: AB017160)31 to ‘ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5’ subfamily of bZIP family. AREB1 is mapped onto chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis, but the locus and entry of AREB1 do not exist in the MIPS dataset. We checked the proteins not identified as transcription factors and added some proteins to the ‘TF_other’ list, if one protein was annotated as transcription factor. We listed 17 proteins as general transcription factors, GTF. In total, we obtained 1968 transcription factors and transcriptional regulators, which account for 7.4% of all Arabidopsis proteins (Table 1).The number of identified transcription factor genes, 1968, was larger than the 1533 reported by Riechmann et al.2 This difference was caused by the added transcription factor families and additional members of each family identified by PSI-BLAST. Recently, Jiao et al.32 reported 1864 transcription factors in Arabidopsis, which were similar to those in our list (data not shown).3.2. Comparison of sensitivity and specificityWe used PSI-BLAST, InterProScan and checked their results manually to obtain a proper transcription factor set. In this process, we referred several papers about their transcription factor families. But this identification strategy is not used in all cases, because not all transcription factor families are well studied and reported in reviews. It is important to recognize the sensitivity and specificity of the PSI-BLAST search results without manual check. We checked the sensitivity and specificity of pre-fixed PSI-BLAST search results on major transcription factor families (MYB, AP2/EREBP, bHLH, NAC, MADS, bZIP, WRKY). We also compared the results with those obtained using BLAST19 and InterProScan.20For the BLAST search, we used the best parameters provided as a result of some parameter tests (see Materials and Methods). For the InterProScan, we selected motifs that gave the best results. For BLAST and PSI-BLAST, we listed non-redundant proteins as search results for comparison because some families (MYB, AP2/EREBP, bHLH, MADS, bZIP) had several query sequences each providing search results. For PSI-BLAST, the numbers of proteins listed in each family are described on the column named ‘genes in family’ of Table 1.Results of PSI-BLAST or BLAST change when we choose another query sequence. We selected query sequences according to the list written by Riechmann et al.2 We thought their sequences were enough to find all proteins in each family with PSI-BLAST, because we got good consistency between PSI-BLAST search results and description of reviews23–30 (Table 2). We used the same query sequences for BLAST search for this comparison.The sensitivity of PSI-BLAST, InterProScan and BLAST was 0.981, 0.980 and 0.924, respectively (Table 2; Fig. 2), there being little difference between PSI-BLAST and InterProScan. These two methods gave a higher sensitivity than BLAST. We evaluated the specificity in six families, because we could not calculate the number of false-positive proteins in the MYB family. The specificity of PSI-BLAST, InterProScan and BLAST was 0.944, 0.981 and 0.962, respectively (Table 2; Fig. 2). Although there was little difference among the three methods, InterProScan showed the highest specificity and PSI-BLAST the lowest. These results showed that the InterProScan is the best method for identifying transcription factors with high sensitivity and specificity. However, PSI-BLAST may be the best tool for detecting all the transcription factors since PSI-BLAST showed the best sensitivity. PSI-BLAST can detect sequence similarities of proteins even if the proteins have partial sequences. By this analysis, we found At2g25820 in a PSI-BLAST search result of the AP2/EREBP family. Indeed, At2g25820 has a partial AP2-type DNA-binding domain (Fig. 3), but if we include the upstream genomic region together, it has the entire DNA-binding domain (Fig. 3). No full-length cDNA or EST supported the translation of the upstream region of the annotated first methionine codon of At2g25820, but the amino acid sequence translated from 5′-UTR has a highly conserved AP2-type DNA-binding domain. Thus, there is a high enough probability that At2g25820 with the entire AP2 domain is translated. A motif search based on the Hidden Markov Model algorithm cannot detect this partial DNA-binding domain. This example showed that PSI-BLAST can detect sequence similarities even from partial protein sequences. Genome sequencing projects on Poplar or Lotus japonicus are in progress.33,34 In many species, there are issues about correct detection of exons or ORFs or CDSs just after sequencing of their genomes.8 PSI-BLAST is expected to be useful for detecting transcription factors more correctly from these genomes. When a novel transcription factor family member is found, we can search for other members of the family quickly based on one query sequence. All of these points indicate the usefulness of PSI-BLAST for identifying transcription factors efficiently from accumulating genome information of plants.Comparison of three methods. (A) PSI-BLAST and InterProScan showed a higher sensitivity than BLAST. (B) PSI-BLAST showed a slightly worse specificity than either InterProScan or BLAST.Comparison of three methods.

RARTF: RIKEN Arabidopsis transcription factor databaseWe constructed a transcription factor database named RARTF (RIKEN Arabidopsis transcription factor database, Author Webpage) based on detected transcription factors (Figs 1 and 4). RARTF provides information on transcription factor families and each transcription factor, and search tools such as PSI-BLAST and RPS-BLAST based on the PSSMs. We made two lists. In the Phase 1 list, there is redundancy of listed proteins and the Phase 2 list is non-redundant (see Materials and Methods). Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences and a phylogenic tree are available for each family or subfamily (Fig. 4). For each transcription factor, we provide the PSI-BLAST search results, functional motif information of InterProScan. We also made some links for other Arabidopsis databases such as MAtDB of MIPS,21 the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)35 and the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) DB.8 For some proteins, the amino acid sequences in these databases are different. In these cases, we recommend checking all the databases. RARTF provides a RPS-BLAST (Reverse PSI-BLAST) search36 tool. By using RPS-BLAST, it is possible to check whether the sequence of the amino acid or DNA or mRNA is one of a transcription factor or not. With the PSI-BLAST search tool on RARTF, we provided PSSMs and datasets of latest Arabidopsis proteins and proteins of O. sativa. The latest lists of transcription factors of A. thaliana and O. sativa37 are available as results of PSI-BLAST searches.Sample views of RIKEN Arabidopsis transcription factor database: RARTF.

From this page, we provide links for information of each member (B), phylogenic tree (C), and amino acid sequences and multiple-alignments.The contents of RARTF linked with RARGE38 (RIKEN Arabidopsis genome encyclopedia) provide more detailed information about transcription factors (Figs 1 and 4). We collected 1072 RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNAs coding for transcription factors.6,7 From the full-length cDNAs, we can identify the exon–intron structures accurately. We can identify the upstream sequences of genes by mapping the full-length cDNAs to the genome. From RARTF, the cis-element database of RARGE38 is available, and cis-elements located in the upstream region of genes that code for transcription factors can be identified. It is important to study the regulatory region of transcription factor genes to understand the transcription network of Arabidopsis. With RARTF, users can search the database of RARGE for alternative splicing events. Out of 1968 transcription factors, 110 genes which code for transcription factors undergo alternative splicing. Alternative splicing events have been reported in the tissue-specific expression of transcription factors in mice.39 This suggested that some transcription factors have another isoform and function in each expressed tissue. In Arabidopsis, strong relationships between alternative splicing events and environmental stress conditions and expressed tissues have been reported.40 It is important to check whether a transcription factor has alternative splicing isoforms or not. RARGE is the largest database on alternative splicing events in Arabidopsis. It might provide useful information on alternative splicing events of transcription factors.RARTF provides information on Ac/Ds transposon mutants.41 There are 836 (∼42%) transcription factor genes tagged by Ac/Ds transposons. Seeds of most of these mutant lines are available from RIKEN Bioresource Center (Author Webpage). We made links to genome maps on RARGE with which users can check the locations of the genes and sites tagged by transposons. Expression profiles of transcription factors are also important. Transcription factors often have critical roles for control expression of other genes under various stress conditions or developmental stages.3–5,42 For example, we showed expression profiles of DREB family transcription factors under drought stress in Table 3. The DREB family is a key transcription factor family that responds to drought stress. Indeed, there are transcription factors with various expression profiles in the DREB family (Table 3). This indicates that transcription factors in one family have a distinct expression manner. We provide the expression profiling results of the transcription factor genes using the 7K RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNA microarray from RARTF. The expression profiling data of 379 transcription factor genes in treatments with cold,42 drought,42 high-salinity,42 abscisic acid,43 high light-stress44 and rehydration45 are available from RARTF. In the near future, we will provide the expression profiles of all 1968 transcription factors in Arabidopsis in various tissues at various developmental stages and under various stress conditions from RARTF.Expression profiles of DREB family transcription factors under drought stress.aEach ratio value is [intensity of each point/intensity at 0 h].

IntroductionIn the last decade, whole genome sequences have been revealed from bacteria to humans in a complete or a draft form. This invaluable information is expected to shift the paradigm of molecular biology by making it possible to predict a complete catalog of protein-coding genes in an organism. However, the genome sequence information alone is not sufficient to achieve this. Information about transcribed sequences is indispensable for deducing protein primary structures encoded by the mammalian genome due to difficult-to-predict exon–intron structure. Furthermore, because the protein primary structures do not necessarily enable us to deduce their biological functions, we need various types of genomic resources to experimentally explore them in a genome-wide manner. In particular, a set of expression plasmids for all the proteins in an organism serves as an indispensable reagent for functional genomics. Thus, many efforts have been made to prepare sets of defined protein-expression clones, so-called ‘ORFeome cloning’, to analyze protein function on a proteomic scale.1–7 Although open reading frame (ORF) is different from the protein-coding sequence (CDS) by definition, we hereafter use ORF rather than CDS for protein-coding sequence to avoid unnecessary confusion, contrary to the conventions used by other researchers.Although ORF cloning into expression vectors has already been attempted in mammals,6,8–10 it involves many technical difficulties at the ORFeome level. The most serious problem is the difficulty in predicting the ORFeome from the mammalian genomic information. Thus, to achieve reliable prediction of protein-coding genes, a large volume of sequence information of cDNAs was accumulated to complement the genomic sequence information in the public domain.11–18 Furthermore, rapidly growing data of genomic and transcriptomic sequences from several different mammals allow us to make comparisons and thereby assign mammalian ORFeomes more convincingly than was possible a few years ago. Therefore, we believe that ORFeome cloning in mammals is a research area that should be accorded high priority.Our cDNA sequencing project was unique, focusing on long cDNAs (>4 kb) encoding relatively large proteins from the brain. This was because of our interest in cDNA clones encoding multidomain proteins, many of which play crucial roles, such as signal transduction, cell–cell communication, cell structure/motility and gene regulation, in multicellular organisms.19,20 More than 2000 newly isolated cDNAs have been entirely sequenced (referred to as KIAA plus a 4-digit number; the average number of amino acid residues in KIAA ORFs was 949). The KIAA cDNA sequences and clones are continuously updated if their ORFs were spuriously interrupted or truncated.21 We have recently started to collect cDNA clones for mouse homologs of human KIAA (mKIAA) genes and polyclonal antibodies against mKIAA proteins to explore the function of KIAA gene products using an animal model in vivo.17,22–24 The information about KIAA and mKIAA genes is available through our databases (HUGE for human KIAA genes; Author Webpage and ROUGE for mouse KIAA genes; Author Webpage).25 Approximately half of the KIAA proteins have not been functionally annotated by Gene Ontology.26 To overcome this situation, it is essential to express KIAA proteins in cells and analyze their functions. Thus, we considered that preparation of cDNA clones in an expression-ready format to accelerate the functional study of KIAA gene products with unknown function on a molecular level was urgently needed. A set of KIAA ORF clones would constitute an indispensable subset of the human ORFeome collection. To achieve this, we needed to solve some technical problems in transferring long ORF to an expression vector in a systematic manner. In this study, we developed a new method, termed as the ORF trap method, for ORFeome cloning of long cDNAs. We describe the details of the ORF trap method, its application to long ORF cloning, and characterization of the protein products of the resultant ORF clones. The results indicate that this method worked effectively and the resultant clone set could be successfully used as a versatile reagent for functional characterization of large proteins.2. Materials and Methods2.1. MaterialspTRAP1 plasmid DNA was constructed by the Gateway BP reaction with pDONR201 plasmid (Invitrogen, USA) and the attB1-SD-Kozak-Not I-attB2 fragment (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCA TGGGGGATGTGAAGCTGGTTGCCTCGTCACACATTTCCAAAACCTCCCT CAGTGTGGCGGCCGCCTCATTGTGGAAACGATGGAGGAAGGTGAAGGG GAAGGGGAAGAGGAAGAAGAGTGGAACCCAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGTCCCC-3′) according to the instructions provided by the supplier, followed by insertion of the DNA fragment harboring the chloramphenicol resistance and ccdB genes amplified by PCR with pDONR201 into the NotI site. The expression clones including various ORFs were constructed by the Gateway LR reaction with the entry clones amplified by the TempliPhi Amplification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK) and pcDNA-DEST47 for expression in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in mammalian cells.2.2. Cultured cellsThe human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line was obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (HSRRB) of the Japan Health Sciences Foundation. The cell line was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% of Tet System Approved Fetal Bovine Serum (BD Biosciences, USA).2.3. Preparation of JC8679 competent cells for electroporationE. coli strain JC8679 (recB21, recC22, sbcA23, thr-1, leuB6, phi-1, lacY1, galK2, ara-14, Xyl-5, mtl-1, proA2, his-4, argE3, rpsL31, tsx-33, supE44, his-328) was obtained from HSRRB of Japan Health Sciences Foundation and used for bacterial transformation. The competent bacterial cells were prepared as follows: a single colony of JC8679 was picked and grown in 30 ml of SOB medium overnight at 37°C. After 5 ml of the cultured bacteria were inoculated into 500 ml of SOB medium, they were cultured with agitation at 37°C until the cells reached OD600 = 0.35–0.4. The cells were then chilled on ice for 15 min and harvested by centrifuging of 2300 g for 10 min at 2°C. After discarding the supernatants, the cells were suspended in 5 ml of ice-cold H2O, then 500 ml of ice-cold H2O was added and the cells were centrifuged and then washed twice. After washing with 20 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol, the cells were suspended in 1.25 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol. Finally, the cells were divided and placed in separate tubes, frozen in dry ice-ethanol and stored in −80°C freezer.2.4. Homologous recombinationA linear plasmid containing gene-specific sequences was generated by PCR in a 50 µl reaction including 2.5 units LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan), 0.25 mM each of four dNTPs and 5 ng of plasmid template, pTRAP1 (94°C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 40°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min; 20 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min) using 2 µM each of a gene-specific orfn-primer (5′-N41CATGGTTCTATC-3′, where N41 indicates a 41 nt-anti-sense sequence after the start codon of ORF) and a gene-specific orfc-primer (5′-N′42XXXXXXXACCCAGCTTTC-3′, where N′42 indicates a 42-nt-sense sequence before the stop codon of ORF). A consecutive X is a discriminator for a native or fusion-type of construct which contains one of the following sequences: TAA/CGTAG, TGA/CGCAG, TGA/TCTAG(A) or TA/CGTACG where the underlined sequences can be digested by SnaBI, FspI, XbaI or BsiWI restriction endonucleases, respectively, where the construct is a fusion-type. Hereafter, PCR products thus amplified are tentatively referred to as trap vectors. The linear trap vector was then purified with 5–10 µg of a plasmid DNA containing cDNA corresponding to respective gene-specific primer sequences (original clones) by Wizard SV 96 PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, USA) and finally dissolved in 5 µl of H2O. JC8679 (20 µl) competent cells were transformed with a mixture of linear trap vector and circular or linear original clone (2 µl) in a cuvette (Bio-Rad, USA, 0.1 cm electrode) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 1.67 kV, 200 ohms and 25 µF. The transformed cells were incubated in 500 µl of SOC at 37°C for 2 h with agitation and were plated on LB-kanamycin (50 µg/ml) agar. To select recombinant clones, plasmid DNAs were prepared from at least eight colonies per electroporation by the nucleic acid purification system, MFX-9600-Magnia with MagExtractor (Toyobo, Japan) in a 96-well format and the recombined regions were confirmed by single-pass sequencing. Single-pass sequencing was performed from both ends of the insert DNA with GatewaySeqL-A (5′-TCGCGTTAACGCTAGCATGGATCTC-3′) and GatewaySeqL-B (5′-GTAACATCAGAGATTTTGAGACAC-3′) primers and ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit Ver. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) using ABI3700 DNA sequencer. After arraying the plasmid clones correctly recombined in a new 96-well plate, the plasmid DNAs were introduced into competent DH10B cells to resolve plasmid multimers formed in JC8679 and were amplified. At the same time, single-pass sequencing was performed from both ends of the insert DNA again and the sizes of the plasmid DNAs in a covalently closed circular form were estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight marker for supercoiled DNA (Supercoiled DNA Ladder, Invitrogen, USA) followed by an ethidium bromide-staining and the FragmeNT analysis of gel image data obtained by FluorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, USA). Although most of the original clones whose backbones were pBluescript II SK (+) vector were adapted into linear form, the cDNA fragment cloned in the pSPORT1 vector were cut out with appropriate restriction enzymes before the recombination reaction to prevent undesired recombination. For some cDNA clones with truncation of a few amino acid residues at the predicted N-terminal sequence, entry clones were constructed by using gene-specific primers containing complementing sequences to make full-length ORFs.2.5. In vitro transcription/translation assaypcDNA-DEST47 destination vector (Invitrogen, USA) was used for the Gateway LR reaction with the entry clones we constructed to produce proteins by an in vitro transcription/translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. For the fusion type of expression clones, C-terminal Cycle 3 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion vector was used. Plasmid DNAs used in an in vitro expression were prepared by MFX-9600-Magnia in a 96-well format from overnight-cultured bacteria and were purified using MultiScreen, MAFB NOB (Millipore, USA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Plasmids (100–200 ng) were subjected to an in vitro transcription/translation system (TNT T7 Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega, USA) in the presence of 4 µl of Quick Mix, 0.2 µl of FluoroTect™ GreenLys tRNA (Promega, USA) and 0.1 µl of 1 M methionine in a final reaction volume of 5.3 µl. The products were resolved on MDG-267 Real Gel Plate (concentration gradient: 5–10%, Biocraft, Japan). Prestained protein size markers (BenchMark size markers, Invitrogen, USA) were used for estimation of the apparent molecular masses of the in vitro products. When multiple discrete bands were observed from a single clone, the size of the largest band was estimated.2.6. Subcellular localization of GFP-fusion proteinGFP-fusion protein expression clones used for subcellular localization were constructed and prepared as described above. Resultant purified DNAs (100–200 ng) were transfected into HEK293 cells using FUGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, USA) in an 8-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc International, USA). Cells (200 µl; 4 × 104) were plated 24 h before the transfection experiment. After 40–50 h of transfection, the subcellular localization of the GFP-fusion proteins was observed by fluorescent microscope (Axiovert S100, Zeiss, Germany) and recorded (DP70, Olympus, Tokyo).2.7. Western blottingFor western blot analysis of GFP-fusion proteins, expression clones were constructed as described above and prepared using QIAGEN Plasmid Kit (Qiagen, Germany). HEK293 (1.5 × 105) cells were plated in 24-well culture plate (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) 24 h before transfection. GFP-fusion protein expression clones (250 ng) were used for the transfection per well. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after the transfection by washing cells with PBS and dissolving with 50 µl of the 2× SDS sample buffer [100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% BPB]. After brief sonication, 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples to a final concentration of 144 mM and the samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min. The sample (1–5 µl) was applied for SDS–Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (MDG-267 Real Gel Plate, concentration gradient: 5–10%, BIOCRAFT, Japan). At a time, some expression clones were subjected to an in vitro transcription/translation system according to the above-described method except a labeling using FluoroTect™ GreenLys tRNA and 5 µl of the sample was used for SDS–PAGE. After the electrophoresis, gels were immersed into the transfer buffer [25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol] for 15 min and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membrane (FluoroTrans W, Pall, USA) using the transfer buffer with the BIOCRAFT BE-300 semidry transfer device. Detection of GFP-fusion protein was performed at room temperature as follows. The transfer membrane was washed with TBS [20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl] including 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) buffer with gentle agitation for 10 min followed by incubation with blocking solution (TBST containing 5% skim milk) for 60 min. The membrane was then incubated with 1:1000 anti-GFP mouse IgG1-k antibody (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) in blocking solution for 60 min. After washing with TBST for 5 min four times, the membrane was incubated with 1:4000 horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) in blocking solution for 60 min. GFP-fusion proteins on the membrane were finally detected by ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences, UK) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer after washing the membrane with TBST for 5 min four times and exposing it to Biomax X-ray films (Kodak, USA) or recording by Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS1000 (FUJIFILM, Japan). Prestained protein size markers (Magic Mark XP, Invitrogen, USA) were used for estimation of the apparent molecular masses of the GFP-fusion proteins.3. Results3.1. Cloning of ORFs by homologous recombination in E. coliIn conventional ORF cloning, PCR has been extensively used as a convenient method for excising ORF from parental cDNA clones. Although care was taken to minimize artificial introduction of mutations in ORF during PCR, accidental isolation of artificially mutated clones was always a possibility. This risk obviously increases as the size of ORF increases. Thus, we were strongly motivated to develop an alternative way to isolate ORF clones, because our ORFs of interest were considerably longer than those manipulated in previous reports.1–4,6 In this study, we used a homologous recombination system in E. coli, JC8679, which has genotype of recBC and sbcA,27–29 for ORF cloning. This recombination cloning system enabled us to construct multiple clones harboring only ORFs (in practice, from the initiation codon to the termination codon) in parallel through the following three major steps: (i) generation of gene-specific trap vector fragments by PCR using pairs of gene-specific primers and pTRAP1 plasmid DNA as a template; (ii) transformation of E. coli JC8679 cells with a gene-specific trap vector fragment and a plasmid DNA harboring the ORF of interest by electroporation; (iii) clone selection/confirmation by single-pass sequencing after growth on agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics. An outline of the ORF trap cloning method is schematically shown in Fig. 1A. In brief, pTRAP1 vector was amplified by PCR using the orfn and orfc primers, which contained gene-specific sequences corresponding to a 41-nt anti-sense sequence after the start codon of ORFs and a 42-nt sense sequence before the stop codon of ORFs, respectively, which serve as tags of homologous recombination. The gene-specific sequence of orfn was flanked by the Shine–Dalgarno (SD)–Kozak sequence while orfc was a mixture of oligomers carrying the gene-specific sequence followed by a termination codon and a non-termination codon. The structures of orfn and orfc primers are shown in Fig. 1B. Resultant linear trap-vector fragments, which have gene-specific sequences at the extremities, were co-introduced into E. coli JC8679 cells with the corresponding cDNA clones. From clones appearing on agar plates containing antibiotics, the flanking sequences of the recombination sites of multiple independent clones were confirmed by single-pass sequencing using vector primers to confirm the recombination at an appropriate site and to remove clones with mutations derived from small amounts of incorrectly synthesized primers and/or PCR errors. Mutations introduced in the vector backbone sequence did not matter because the vector backbone was eventually replaced by the expression vectors. In particular, we designed this cloning method so as to be able to simultaneously obtain ORF clones both for production of C-terminal fusion protein and for native protein. For this purpose, the orfc primer was a mixture of two primers with and without the ORF termination codon. As shown in Fig. 1B, to discriminate native and C-terminal fusion type of expression clones, a unique restriction endonuclease cleavage site was introduced in the fusion type of clone at the region where the termination codon was removed. As a result, any tag sequence of interest can be introduced in the unique restriction cleavage site. For maximum versatility, the resultant ORF clones are in a compatible format with an in vitro lambda phage recombinational cloning system, known as the Gateway system.30 Once the ORF clones were successfully obtained, we were able to prepare expression plasmids for their native, N-terminal fusion and C-terminal fusion proteins in various expression systems on demand using the Gateway recombination cloning system. Using 1589 putative full-length ORFs (from 1121 human and 468 mouse genes) with an average size of 2.8 kb, we successfully prepared expression plasmids for 1463 native proteins and for 1343 fusion proteins by this method. Putative full-length ORFs were chosen on the basis of sequence information on homologous genes and GENSCAN predicted CDSs. Information about the entry clones thus prepared is available through Supplementary Table (available at Author Webpage) and the HUGE protein database.Schematic representation of the ORF trap cloning.

Evaluation of recombinant proteins produced in vitro by SDS–PAGETo characterize the recombinant proteins, 1530 native type and 1442 GFP-fusion proteins were synthesized in vitro and evaluated by SDS–PAGE. Although some protein products migrated faster or slower than expected, apparent molecular mass estimated by SDS–PAGE is known to vary considerably according to the amino acid sequences and/or post-translational modifications on proteins.32 Thus, we focused our efforts on comparing the size-differences between the native and the fusion protein to evaluate the recombinant products, rather than on their absolute apparent molecular masses. Thus, apparent molecular masses of 1334 (87%) native recombinant proteins and 1283 (89%) GFP-fusion proteins were estimated in a range from 70 to 160% against molecular weights predicted by SDS–PAGE (Supplementary Table is available at Author Webpage). Fig. 2A shows examples of the analysis of the fluorescence-labeled proteins (clones described in ORFT16 and ORFT17 plates in the Supplementary Table which is available at Author Webpage). Although some small bands, probably resulting from degradation or accidental translation from an internal methionine codon, were seen in some lanes, the sizes of the largest proteins were always compared with the predicted molecular masses. Comparison of the apparent molecular masses of 1179 pairs of native and GFP-fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 2B. The average size of fluorescence-labeled native proteins was 111 kDa and the average size-difference between native and GFP-fusion proteins was 29.6 kDa with a standard deviation of 5.3. Because fusion of the GFP moiety resulted in an increase in the molecular mass of the recombinant proteins by 26.8 kDa, the increase of apparent molecular mass of the GFP-fusion protein by ∼30 kDa on SDS–PAGE indicated that the reading frame of the recombinant protein was correctly maintained after the ORF trap cloning.Evaluation of ORF trap clones by estimation of the size of their recombinant proteins.

Analysis of transiently expressed GFP-fusion proteins in cultured cellsTo demonstrate the usefulness of the set of long ORF clones, we first examined the subcellular localization of transiently expressed GFP-fusion proteins in living HEK293 cells along with the systematic analysis for subcellular localization of expressed fusion proteins developed by Simpson and coworkers.8 Example of subcellular localizations of transiently expressed GFP-fusion proteins were shown in Fig. 3A. We identified the subcellular localizations for 719 GFP-fusion proteins in HEK293 cells with a success rate of 82%, and they were tentatively classified into 13 groups as shown in Table 1. Nearly 34% of the fusion proteins were dispersed in whole cytoplasm, while some proteins were localized in unspecified organelles within the cytoplasm in a speckled distribution (the ‘cytoplasmic organelle’ group in Table 1). Some speckles had the potential to translocate with detectable speed in the cytoplasm, suggesting that their organization is dependent on a microtubular system similar to that of peroxisomes (data not shown).33 The next most frequently observed localization was the nucleus (12.6%). Although some fusion proteins were localized as interchromatin granule clusters in the nucleus (the ‘nuclear vesicle’ group in Table 1), their detailed localization has yet to be studied. The fluorescent images of HEK293 cells expressing GFP-fusion proteins are accessible through the InGaP database (Author Webpage).34Recombinant proteins expressed in HEK293 cells.

The production levels of the GFP-fusion proteins varied considerably from gene to gene, although all of them were placed under the control of an identical CMV promoter (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–12). Among 12 GFP-fusion proteins examined in our study, some of them showed the extra bands that were slower to migrate on the SDS–PAGE (white closing brackets in Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 4–7) than expected bands with the sizes estimated by in vitro products. Multiple bands that were faster to migrate on the gel were also detected in some lanes. To compare the apparent molecular masses of the recombinant proteins with the extra bands in HEK293 cells that migrated slowly (Cell Ext. in Fig. 3C) with those of the corresponding in vitro products, the GFP-fusion proteins produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL in Fig. 3C) were simultaneously analyzed by the protein blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody. The positions of their major products produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate are indicated by black arrows in Fig. 3C. These results can reveal the occurrence of post-translational events such as modification or processing on certain proteins in certain cells. In the human L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), the size difference appeared to be caused by protein modifications such as glycosylation because this gene encoded an integral membrane glycoprotein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (Fig. 3C, lane 1). KIAA1044, KIAA1158, KIAA1169 and KIAA0659 GFP-fusion proteins, which are potassium channel KV4.2, sodium channel beta-3 subunit precursor, two-pore channel 1 and neural stem cell-derived dendrite regulator, respectively, also showed distinct SDS–PAGE patterns when they were produced in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 3C, lanes 4–7).4. DiscussionIt is widely accepted that full-length cDNA clones in an expression-ready form are essential for functional analysis of mammalian genes.35 For comprehensive functional analysis, it is an urgent task to prepare a complete set of full-length genes, which can direct the synthesis of authentic proteins encoded by the genome, because they serve as indispensable and versatile reagents for production of recombinant proteins. In mammalian systems, cDNA clones are extensively used for this purpose. There are many sophisticated methods for constructing full-length clone-enriched cDNA libraries, but none of them guarantees that every cDNA clone thus generated is full-length.36,37 Therefore, the cDNA clones must be carefully evaluated by multiple independent criteria to ensure they are full-length. Since sequence information of orthologous genes among different mammals has become available recently, comparison of the genomic structures of these orthologues enables us to judge whether a cDNA clone encodes full-length ORF or not with increased confidence. The long cDNA clones manipulated in the present study were considered as full-length in this way.21 Recent technical improvements in comprehensively assigning 5′-extreme sequences could eventually confirm the 5′-end structures of human cDNAs,38–40 and, if necessary, these ORF clones should be revised accordingly. This is highly critical in ORF clones because even a single amino acid change could have a dramatic effect on protein function.Large cDNAs are generally difficult targets to manipulate, particularly in a systematic manner. Although PCR is often used for ORF cloning of short cDNAs, we considered that for long cDNAs, the amplification step of PCR should be avoided if possible. We developed a homologous recombination system in E. coli to clone large ORF regions into a vector to prevent mutations in the protein-coding sequences in this study. So far, we have attempted to construct 1121 clones for human genes and 468 clones for mouse genes including KIAA and mKIAA genes, which encode relatively large proteins. Most of the clones were confirmed by single-pass sequencing of recombination sites and by evaluation of their expressed proteins. Our experience indicates that this method is quite useful for ORFeome cloning in general.When considering the role of gene products, it is useful to elucidate their subcellular distribution even though this information is often obtained from experiments using exogenous gene products. According to the UniProt Knowledgebase (Author Webpage), there are only ∼80 reports concerning subcellular localizations of KIAA genes in the citation information of the databases. Determination of the subcellular localization of the remaining unanalyzed KIAA gene products is urgently needed. We have been analyzing the subcellular localizations and the records will be available through our InGaP database (Author Webpage).34 This database also contains immunohistochemical data using antibodies against mKIAA proteins, which we accumulated in another project.24 The comparison of subcellular localizations of mKIAA-GFP fused proteins and antibody-detected mKIAA proteins would provide many biological insights regarding the functions of mKIAA proteins. It should be noted that we analyzed 12 GFP-fusion proteins by protein blotting in parallel with fluorescent imaging analysis. Since we accumulated SDS–PAGE patterns for respective GFP-fusion proteins produced in vitro as described in this study, the comparison of SDS–PAGE patterns for transiently expressed GFP-fusion proteins in certain cells with those of the corresponding in vitro products could reveal occurrence of post-translational modifications (e.g. processing by protease, glycosylation and phosphorylation). Together with the information about their subcellular distribution, these sources of information may provide comprehensive insights into the biological function of KIAA/mKIAA proteins.According to the Ensembl database (build34, Author Webpage), 9.5% of human genes (2108 genes) encode proteins composed of ≥1000 amino acid residues. While each cDNA is not always full-length, ∼70% of the entirely sequenced cDNAs corresponding to those genes that encode large proteins (most of which are derived from the human brain) are collected at present in our Institute. On the other hand, of the 1002 putative full-length ORFs for KIAA genes treated in this study, only 20% of KIAA cDNA clones are listed in human ORFeome Version 1.1 (Open Biosystems, 8266 human cDNAs)6 as other full-length cDNA clones, based on structural comparison by FASTA analysis (ungapped identities and coverage against amino acid sequences of KIAA proteins were >95% and >90%, respectively, data not shown). This implies that availability of ORF clones for large proteins is quite low in the research community. As a research group making efforts to identify unknown large cDNAs, we intend to collect as many as possible cDNAs encoding relatively large proteins in a full-length expression-ready form. The collection of mammalian long ORF clones will keep growing and will be an invaluable resource for the advancement of molecular biology and medical science.Supplementary MaterialSupplementary material is available online at Author WebpageThis project was supported by grants from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute.

Introduction The genetic information contained in DNA is transcribed to RNA by a transcription complex including DNA-directed RNA polymerase (RNAP). A bacterial transcription initiation complex comprised of the core RNAP enzyme and a σ factor binds to a promoter and, upon initiation of RNA synthesis, releases the σ factor. 1 The archaeal transcription initiation machinery has a combination of different core RNAP proteins and basal transcription factors (TFs) such as TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor B, each of which is homologous to the eukaryotic counterpart. 2 In either case, the transcriptional complex can be easily detected by homology because the essentiality of the transcriptional complex entails high conservation of amino acid sequence in every component. On the other hand, TFs such as repressors, activators and enhancer binding proteins, all of which bind to double-stranded DNA at specific sites to interfere or modulate RNAP function, display an enormous variation. 3 , 4 Different types of TFs have dissimilar 3D structures, with the only shared characteristic being the ability to bind double-stranded DNA. The aim of this study is 2-fold: one is to develop a method to systematically detect all kinds of TFs encoded by a genome with the highest possible accuracy, and the other is to compare results among all prokaryotic species, particularly focusing on any distinctions between bacteria and archaea. As we are conducting a separate investigation on eukaryotes, utilizing extensively compiled data of eukaryotic TFs in the TRANSFAC database, 5 we limit our attention to prokaryotes in this paper.  Although there have been hitherto no genome-wide surveys for TFs across all prokaryotes, several investigations have been carried out for particular species, taxons or TF families: Perez-Rueda and Collado-Vides 6 conducted keyword and PROSITE searches to assign 314 regulatory DNA binding proteins in Escherichia coli , and stored them in the RegulonDB database. Aravind and Koonin 7 examined all the archaeal genomes then available ( Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum, Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Pyrococcus horikoshii ) and made a long list of HTH (helix–turn–helix) proteins, which include some non-TFs. Kyrpides and Ouzounis 8 investigated the same four archaeal species, found 280 transcription-associated proteins including not only TFs but also basal TFs and RNAPs, and classified them into 58 families. A larger scaled survey by Cases et al. 9 investigated 60 bacterial species and categorized proteins into several functional groups, including a group of transcription-related proteins. Ranea et al. 10 performed proteomics analyses on 56 prokaryotic species and classified proteins into CATH 11 superfamilies and functional categories containing one with transcriptional regulators. Recently, Martinez-Bueno et al. 12 exhaustively identified TFs of the AraC-XylS and TetR families from 123 genomes of archaea and bacteria, and deposited them in the BacTregulators database. All the above-mentioned identifications of TFs are in principle based on sequence alignment of the entire sequence. However, as the DBD of a TF constitutes only a small portion such approach often fails to properly identify a DBD and consequently leads to overidentification. On the other hand, Babu and Teichmann 13 used SCOP 14 domains aligned to DBDs as identifiers, listed 271 TFs of E. coli and classified them into 11 TF families including 1 with an RNA-binding domain. As the same SCOP domains are sometimes found in both DBDs and non-DBDs (see Results) this methodology also produces some overidentified cases. In order to reliably detect TFs we developed a novel method employing a combination of a DBD and a contiguous non-DBD with specific SCOP or Pfam domains as the main identifiers of TFs. Our method detects all experimentally verified prokaryotic TFs and is considered to miss or erroneously assign TFs infrequently. Application of the rules for each kind of TFs (i.e. TF family) to entirely sequenced prokaryotes revealed that bacteria have many kingdom-specific families of TFs, whereas archaea share almost all of their TF families with bacteria.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Genome data The main body of the dataset used in the present study comes from the GTOP database 15 ( Author Webpage ), which has been constructed and maintained in this laboratory. GTOP contains all the open reading frames (ORFs) assigned to each organism by the genome sequencing team, and provides structural and functional information on ORFs analyzed by homology search at the protein level. In GTOP, a PSI-BLAST 16 search was conducted for each query ORF against the public databases of PDB 17 (released on 14 November 2003) and SCOP 14 (version 1.65), together with a BLAST search against Swiss-Prot 18 (version 42.5). The E -value threshold was set at 0.001 in both search methods. The hidden Markov model program (HMMER) 19 was also utilized for the search against Pfam 20 (version 11). We used a version of GTOP (released on 19 May 2004) containing the genomic data of 18 archaeal and 136 bacterial species together with a number of eukaryotes and bacteriophages. 2.2. TFs for analyses We deal with all kinds of TFs bound to the double-stranded DNA at specific sites to regulate RNAP function but not those bound to DNA in a non-specific manner or involved in the initiation complex of RNAP itself. Accordingly, bacterial σ factors or archaeal general TFs (TBP) were excluded from our analyses. Also omitted are DNA binding proteins that function non-specifically, such as bacterial HU and archaeal histones, as they affect the transcription process in general. 21 Moreover factors controlling transcription termination like Rho, 22 which bind to RNA rather than DNA, were kept out of this study. Ambiguous cases were decided individually by consulting the literature; we excluded those that were originally regarded as TFs, but were recently revealed not to be TFs, such as cold-shock proteins 23 and TenA. 24 Following the current classification of TFs, each TF family was defined based on the kind of DBD it contains and was named after a representative gene (protein) belonging to the family (see Table 1 ).

Selection of TFs with experimental evidence We first surveyed all the prokaryotic entries of Swiss-Prot to select TFs annotated with direct experimental evidence, excluding those annotated ‘by similarity’. The selected entries were manually checked as to whether the literature cited therein provided genuine experimental evidence, and those failing such confirmation were removed. The final count of the Swiss-Prot entries that satisfy our aforementioned criteria of TFs is 382, of which 135 were from E. coli and 48 came from Bacillus subtilis. The remaining 199 TFs were taken from various species, including 13 TFs from six archaeal species: Sulfolobus solfataricus , Methanosarcina acetivorans , Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 , M. jannaschii , Methanococcus maripaludis and Pyrococcus furiosus . To find more TFs with experimental evidence, we conducted an additional survey of TF candidates in Pfam and SCOP database with experimental evidence, and added their homologs to form a set of TF candidates. Only those candidate TFs that meet the criteria of the previous section and that are not annotated as TFs in Swiss-Prot were retained. We then conducted a literature search for every remaining candidate to identify TFs with direct experimental evidence. With 12 TFs found in this process, we obtained a total of 394 TFs with experimental evidence and designated it as the set of experimentally verified TFs. 3. Results3.1. Detection of TFs based on selection rules Examining many TFs, we noticed that most of them can be detected by a combination of a DBD and a contiguous non-DBD with specific SCOP or Pfam domains as the identifier of TFs ( Fig. 1a ). We note that, besides the directionality of DBDs and non-DBDs in the figure, a DBD may be present at the C-terminal end of a non-DBD. 13 Homology search for the entire sequence of gene/protein may detect three proteins (MglB, LacI and AraR) as homologs having similar functions, because a large part of the sequence can be aligned to each other. In reality, however, MglB is a periplasmic ligand binding protein, whereas both LacI and AraR function as TFs (repressors). We note that LacI and AraR are classified into different TF families (the LacI and GntR families, respectively) based on the difference in the N-terminal DBDs, although they possess a common structural domain (SCOP ID: c.93.1.1) at the C-termini. This example illustrates that despite the small size of a DBD, its presence is crucial for a protein to function as a TF. It should be emphasized that the existence of a SCOP or Pfam domain characteristic of a DBD is necessary, but it is not a sufficient condition for a TF: for example, despite having the same SCOP domain (a.4.6.3) as assigned to the DBD of a TF, SCOP domain (c.55.7.1) is annotated as methylated-DNA-protein-cysteine methyltransferase in Swiss-Prot and is not a TF ( Fig. 1b ). The combination approach thus reduces the number of non-TFs erroneously detected as TFs in approaches involving the DBD only.  Domain organization of TFs. ( a ) LacI and AraR are TFs with DBDs, while MglB is not a TF because it has no DBD. ( b ) Despite the presence of the same SCOP domain (a.4.6.3) in Ogt and spo0A, the former is not a TF, while the latter is.  Domain organization of TFs. ( a ) LacI and AraR are TFs with DBDs, while MglB is not a TF because it has no DBD. ( b ) Despite the presence of the same SCOP domain (a.4.6.3) in Ogt and spo0A, the former is not a TF, while the latter is.  We individually determined the domain organization pattern of each TF family from the set of experimentally verified TFs. We classified TFs into families according to the specific combinations of Pfam and/or SCOP domains corresponding to the DBDs and non-DBDs they contain. Each TF family consists of members of the set of experimentally verified TFs that have both a DBD and a contiguous non-DBD with specific Pfam or SCOP domains. For example, the rule for the Spo0A family ( Fig. 1b and Table 1 ) stipulates that proteins contain at least one of the combinations of a DBD and a non-DBD, a.4.6.3-PF00072 and a.4.6.3-c.23.1.1, and thereby excludes Ogt_bsub, because this protein has neither a PF00072 nor a c.23.1.1 domain juxtaposed to the DBD.  In this way, we set up selection rules for individual TF families through analyses of the domain organization of experimentally verified TFs. We determined a rule for each TF family by trial and error; when evident false positives were found, then the selection rule was revised and the process was repeated until there remained no false positives. By Pfam or SCOP combinations, we can detect 86.1% of TFs in the experimentally verified set. In addition, the following cases were included in the selection rules. Many TFs with only DBD assignment (e.g. those in the TetR/AcrR family) represent those whose non-DBDs have yet to be assigned. A small number of TFs, e.g. those in the PaiB family, are short and clearly possess DBDs only, because non-DBDs cannot possibly be present in the remainder of the small protein. Both kinds will be called ‘solitary’ TF families below, and together constitute 9.8% of the TFs. The rest in the set of experimentally verified TFs can be detected using alignment to existing members of TF families with the requirement that the length of the hit sequences differ from that of the query by <20% (expressed as ‘aligned to a TF of comparable length’ in the following). The length requirement is intended to ensure alignment for nearly the entire length including the DBD, which tends to be short, and thereby to minimize over-assignment. COG number(s) (from the COG database, 25 20 June 2004 release) specifically assigned to most of the TF families serve to verify sequence alignments. Table 1 presents a list of 52 TF families, each with Pfam and SCOP identifiers and a representative TF.  Based on the analysis of the experimentally verified TFs, we set up the following criteria for TF selection. A protein with a DBD and a contiguous non-DBD with a combination of Pfam or SCOP domains specific to each TF family ( Table 1 ) is said to be a high confidence TF. A protein with a DBD of a Pfam or SCOP domain specific for a solitary TF family is considered as a high confidence TF, too, if it is aligned to an experimentally verified TF of comparable length belonging to the same family. Furthermore a protein with a Pfam or SCOP domain characteristic of a TF family but without non-DBD assignment is also classified as a high confidence TF, if it is aligned to a TF family member of comparable length. On the other hand, a protein lacking an identifiable DBD is judged to be a highly probable TF if it is aligned to an experimentally verified TF of comparable length. Finally a protein is regarded as a probable TF if it is detected with a DBD of a Pfam or SCOP domain characteristic of a TF family, but with no homologs in the set of experimentally verified TFs. The high quality set is defined to include only high confidence and highly probable TFs. Our analyses of TFs are based exclusively on high quality TFs (see below).  The aforementioned TF assignment procedure was applied to 154 wholly sequenced prokaryotic genomes in GTOP. The total number of TFs detected in the high quality set was 18 577, 95% of which were detected as high confidence TFs, while the remainder (5%) were classified as highly probable TFs. Table 1 lists the total count of high confidence TFs in each TF family. The largest TF family is LysR, followed by TetR/ArcR and GntR. Though we did not take the order of DBDs and non-DBDs into account, each TF family turned out to have a specific order with absolutely no exceptions. This finding is in agreement with a previous investigation 26 reporting that the order of domains is nearly fixed in prokaryotic proteins. The number distribution of TF families shows that a small number of major TF families and a large number of minor ones exist. This tendency is in good agreement with the reported distribution of E. coli TFs 13 that obeys the power law. 27 Detailed data of high confidence and highly probable TFs as well as the numbers of TFs and TF families assigned in each genome are available from the GTOP_TF database ( Author Webpage ) and the Supplementary Table ( Author Webpage ). 3.2. Comparison with previous studies In order to check the precision of the TF detection method, it is important to compare the results with those reported in the literature. Such comparisons are, however, not straightforward to make because the definitions of TFs and TF families often differ from one study to another. For instance, Babu and Teichmann 13 employed the SCOP domain as the identifier of TFs in their thorough TF analysis for E. coli . However, as their definition of the TF families is based on DBDs specified by the SCOP superfamilies and not the SCOP and Pfam families as in our case, it is difficult to compare the two results. It is nevertheless possible to compare the two results at the individual protein level using one-to-one correspondence. Babu and Teichmann 13 detected 271 TFs from E. coli , 233 of which were identical to our high quality set ( Fig. 2 ). Out of the 38 proteins found exclusively in their set, 13 proteins [e.g. CspA (cold-shock protein), Hns (histon-like protein) and RpoE (sigma-E factor)] were attributable to the different definition they use, while the remaining 25 were categorized as ‘probable’ TFs and therefore not included in the high quality set. Almost all of these probable TFs, e.g. YafY, YaiV and YbaQ, are products of hypothetical genes and have been poorly characterized. In contrast 19 TFs with experimental support, including 11 annotated in Swiss-Prot (e.g. BolA, CaiF, and CdaR), were missed by Babu and Teichmann presumably because the unavailability of the structure of the DBDs in these proteins made it impossible to identify them as TFs by SCOP search alone.  Relationship of E. coli TFs annotated in Swiss-Prot, the high quality TFs (present study) and TFs annotated by Babu and Teichmann. 13 The 11 proteins shared by Swiss-Prot and GTOP_TF are BolA, CaiF, CdaR Crl, DcuR, DpiA, GutM, MalY, MtlR, NikR and PutA. The 8 proteins assigned only in the present study are SfsA, YehT, YggD, YjgJ, YjhU, YpdB, YqjI and YrbA. The 38 proteins exclusively assigned by Babu and Teichmann 13 are CspA, FecI, FrvR, Hns, IhfA, IhfB, PinQ, RacR, RpoE, StpA, YafY, YagA, YaiV, YbaQ, YdaW, YdcQ, YddM, YeiI, YfeC, YfeD, YffH, YffS, YfgA, YfjR, YgeH, YheO, YhgG, YhiE, YiiF, YjjM, YmfN, YqeH, YqeI, B0373, B0502, B0540, B1027 and B1146.

Genome sequencing teams provide detailed lists of individual genes assigned to the genomes and classify them into functional groups. We found 11 such species, including 2 archaea ( M. acetivorans and A. fulgidus ), and compared the assignment of TFs with ours at the TF family level ( Table 2 ). The results of genome-wide manual annotations and our TF assignments generally agree. Moreover, the agreement is as good in species of archaea as those of bacteria. We therefore claim that the method developed in this research excludes doubtful cases and detects more TFs than those reported in the literature. The results also indicate that our procedure works as well on archaeal species as on bacteria despite the presence of only a small number of archaeal proteins in the set of experimentally verified TFs.

Diversity of TFs in prokaryotes For comparison of different species, Fig. 3 plots the number of TFs per genome (the figures are given in GTOP_TF) against the total number of ORFs, which serves as an indicator of genome size in prokaryotes. Excluding archaea and a few other species, the graph shows an initial lag up to ∼1500 ORFs per genome and then a nearly linear increase. This observation is consistent with the quadratic relationship previously reported. 10 The initial lag section contains those species that have only a few TFs with a small genome size, i.e. 1500 ORFs or less. These species are all parasitic and symbiotic organisms: seven Chlamydiae; seven Mollicutes; two Rickettsias species in Alphaproteobacteria; three Buchneras species, Wigglesworthia brevipalpis and Candidatus Blochmannia floridanus in Gammaproteobacteria; two Tropherymas species in Actinobacteria and Nanoarchaeum equitans in Nanoarchaea. The number of TFs in these organisms ranges from 2 to 11 (see GTOP_TF). In sharp contrast to its complete absence in archaea, DnaA is found in all bacterial species presumably because this protein plays the dual role of an essential factor involved in DNA replication and of a transcription regulator, 28 although the latter function is unlikely to be essential. Besides DnaA, the HrcA repressor (a negative regulator of heat shock genes) is universally present in Chlamydiae and Mollicutes species, but is completely absent in Buchnera species. We think it likely that these parasitic and symbiotic organisms have shed most TFs as they retained only the minimum sets of genes for their dependent life style. Relationship between the number of TFs and genome size. The total number of high quality TFs per genome is plotted against genome size (an indicator of the total number of ORFs).Relationship between the number of TFs and genome size. The total number of high quality TFs per genome is plotted against genome size (an indicator of the total number of ORFs). The nearly linear section (open symbols and small gray dots in Fig. 3 ) consists of the majority of bacteria. The positive intersection with the x -axis corresponding to the lag shows that TFs are needed in proportion to the genome size above a certain number of ORFs (∼1500). The TFs may be considered as factors that regulate complex cell functions beyond the minimum level. Though Betaproteobacteria (8 species) and Lactobacillales (13 species) belong to this group, they are shifted upward (open symbols) from the rest of the group. Four species with large genomes including two Actinobacteria ( Streptomyces avermitilis and Streptomyces coelicolor ) and two Alphaproteobacteria ( Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Mesorhizobium loti ) have 453–639 TFs (see also GTOP_TF), although the number of TF families they have is limited to 33–35, which is less than those of many Gammaproteobacteria including E. coli . Figure 4 presents this point more clearly; the number of TF families levels off with large numbers of TFs. In other words, in species with >300 TFs the number of TF families remains nearly constant (35–40), suggesting the divergence of similar TFs by gene duplication. It is also noticed that Gammaproteobacteria and Bacillales (open symbols in Fig. 4 ) have relatively more TF families than others.

The number of TF families of each species is plotted against the total number of high quality TFs in the genome. On the other hand, the group lying close to the abscissa (filled symbols in Fig. 3 ) has no clear lag phase, but instead shows a roughly linear dependence over the entire range with a slope less steep than that in the nearly linear section described above. This group consists of Cyanobacteria (8 species), Spirochaetes (4), Planctomycetes (1) and all 18 archaeal species. Species of this group have characteristically small numbers of TFs. The most remarkable among them is the Pirellula sp ., the only entirely sequenced species in Planctomycetes, 29 as it has only 91 TFs despite the large genome size (7325 ORFs). The number should be compared with 500 TFs or more expected in bacteria of similar genome sizes. A key to account for this discrepancy lies in the fact that Pirellula sp . has as many as 50 σ factors besides TFs. 29 Scarcity of TFs is also notable in Cyanobacteria, especially in the Anabaena sp . ( Nostoc sp. ), which has only 133 TFs in 6132 ORFs. The scantiness of TFs in Cyanobacteria can be explained by the fact that Cyanobacteria have a highly developed two-component signal transduction system. 30 Throughout all the archaeal species examined, the numbers of TFs and TF families are small ( Figs 3 and 4 ). We consider this to be the most significant finding in the present study and discuss it in the following section. 4. DiscussionIn contrast to previously publicized methods, the newly developed method uses a combination of Pfam or SCOP domains assigned to the DBDs and the non-DBDs of proteins to select TFs. Compared with the single use of the DBDs, this combination approach drastically reduces over-assigned cases. To exclude over-assigned cases in solitary TF families, we introduced an additional requirement, namely alignment to an experimentally verified TF of comparable length. We anticipate a very low number of mistakenly detected cases in the set of TFs selected by our method. The sensitivity and therefore the extent of under-assignment of the TF detection method developed in the present study depends mainly on the sensitivity of the homology-search tools utilized, i.e. BLAST, PSI-BLAST and HMMER. In the GTOP database, the average residue-wise fraction of proteins aligned to known a 3D structure (PDB) by PSI-BLAST in the genomes of prokaryotic species is 45.5%, but this fraction is increasing with time as the number of PDB entries increases. The corresponding residue-wise fraction aligned to Pfam is even higher (52.0% if HMMER is used for alignment) presumably reflecting the fact that the Pfam database is constructed independently of the known protein structures. Although the fraction of known domains is considerable and increasing, a significant number of protein domains in each genome remain unknown. As we cover all the experimentally verified TFs in prokaryotes by our detection rules, cases missed by our method arise only from the failure to detect TFs caused by faulty performance of alignment programs or the lack of known homologs. The failure of all the alignment programs to detect homology with known proteins is considered to be infrequent, thanks to the high sensitivity of PSI-BLAST and HMMER. We expect the alignment programs to work almost equally reliably on proteins in archaea as those in bacteria despite the phylogenic remoteness and generally sparser protein annotation in archaea than in bacteria, particularly in E. coli and B. subtilis . In fact, the average residue-wise coverage of proteins by PDB with the use of PSI-BLAST is 42.3% in archaea and is comparable to the corresponding figure, 46.1%, in bacteria. Consequently the only possible major source of under-assignment is the failure to detect DBDs because they belong to unknown families. However, as bacterial TFs are well studied it is unlikely to find many new DBD families in bacteria. Furthermore, considering the fact that more than half of proteins in archaea have SCOP and Pfam domain assignments and that almost no archaea-specific TF families have been found in structurally aligned proteins, we think it improbable to discover many archaea-specific TF families in the future with more PDB data. Comparison of TFs detected by our method with previously reported TFs ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ) supports the conclusion of theoretical considerations.  As shown in Figs 3 and 4 , the numbers of TFs and TF families are lower in archaea than in the majority of bacteria. For example, M. acetivorans , whose genome is larger than that of E. coli , has only 80 high quality TFs classified into 13 TF families (see GTOP_TF). To compare bacteria and archaea more systematically, the phylogenetic pattern for each TF family across major taxa of prokaryotes is presented in Fig. 5 , where only those taxa having four or more species of known genome are included. The following observations remain valid even if taxa with less than four species are included (Supplemental Table S1 and GTOP_TF). Surprisingly there was only one minor TF family specific to archaea found in this study, Archaeal HTH-10 (the third row, Fig. 5 ). We note that there are no TF families commonly shared by archaea and eukaryotes besides those shown in Fig. 5 ; although all protein sequences of archaea were searched in the GTOP database against all kinds of Pfam domains including eukaryotic DBDs (e.g. zinc-finger, homeobox, and leucine-zipper), no eukaryotic DBDs were detected in archaea. As depicted in Fig. 5 , archaea and bacteria share 18 TF families including 10 out of a total of 20 major ones (rows 4–21, in which the major TF families are yellow-tinted), including the nearly ubiquitous LysR, TetR/AcrR and GntR families. Since the same domain organization is kept throughout the prokaryotes, as shown with the AsnC/Lrp family, 31 , 32 these TF families must have descended from the common ancestor of bacteria and archaea. 8 Notably there are no essential differences between Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota (columns 2 and 3), although some TF families (e.g. LysR, MerR and BirA) are absent in Crenarchaeota. The remaining 10 major as well as 23 minor families in the list are unique to bacteria and are also absent in eukaryotes according to our preliminary analyses. Thus, they must have evolved in bacteria after branching off from archaea. Interestingly, well-known TFs such as OmpR, AraC, LacI and Fis fall in this group. At the same time, we notice several taxon-specific TF families: ROS/MUCR (specific to Alphaproteobacteria), AfsR/DnrI/RedD (Actinobacteria) and ComK (Bacillales) as well as MtlR, MetJ and Crl (Gammaproteobacteria), as previously reported. 33 It should be noted, however, that these taxon/species-specific TF families are all minor families, and are more or less biased to the present knowledge of TFs with experimental evidence. It is relevant to note that Gammaproteobacteria tend to have more TF families detected than other bacteria with comparable numbers of TFs per genome ( Fig. 4 ), which generally reflect the genome size ( Fig. 3 ). We consider it probable that this difference reflects the better-studied nature of Gammaproteobacteria, especially E. coli , than other bacteria. Minor TF families unique to individual taxa or species will increase in the future as experimental evidence accumulates, especially in bacteria other than Gammaproteobacteria. However, the distribution of major TF families is unlikely to be altered, since only minor TF families in bacteria and archaea are possibly not covered by the present selection rules as reasoned in the preceding paragraph. Therefore we consider it probable that approximately half of the major TF families exist exclusively in bacteria, while the rest are shared by the two kingdoms.  Phylogenetic pattern of high confidence TF families. Presence or absence of each TF family in major phyla is shown. The abbreviation of each phylum with the number of species after removing those of obligatory and semi-obligatory parasites in brackets is Crenarchaeota, Cr (4); Euryarchaeota, Eu (13); Actinobacteria, Ac (10); Cyanobacteria, Cy (8); Bacillales, Ba (12); Clostridia, Cl (4); Lactobacillales, La (13); Alphaproteobacteria, αP (9); Betaproteobacteria, βP (8); Gammaproteobacteria, γP (29); Epsilonproteobacteria, ɛP (5): Spirochaetes, Sp (4); Mollicutes, Mo* (7); and Chlamydiae, Ch* (7).

Figure 3 indicates that Cyanobacteria and Spirochaetes belong to the same group as archaea. Figure 5 shows that these bacteria (Cy and Sp) indeed have a limited number of TF families, but have a different repertoire (e.g. OmpR) from that of archaea. The life of obligatory or semi-obligatory parasites, such as Chlamydiae, Mycoplasma and Buchnera , depends heavily on host cells for nutrition, resulting in deletion of many genes from the genomes. 34 Hence, it is natural to think that many kinds of TFs have also been deleted in these species. A recent study 35 revealed that Buchnera has lost all genes but one (metR) that regulate transcriptions of genes involved in syntheses of various amino acids. The idea is corroborated by the TF family distribution of Mollicutes, which include Mycoplasma and Chlamydiae (Mo * and Ch * in Fig. 5 ). The fact that they have only a few TFs implies that expression of all of their genes is mostly under no specific regulation just as in the case of housekeeping genes. On the other hand, autotrophic species in Gammaproteobacteria, Bacillales and other phyla tend to have many kinds of TFs to control cellular processes in response to environmental changes. Assuming that the variety in the TF family a given species possesses is indicative of the complexity of the species, Gammaproteobacteria are the most diversified form of prokaryotes ( Figs 4 and 5 ), although some of the minor TF families must be biased to good annotation of E. coli as described above. Thus, by the same measure, we can say that archaea are less diverse than bacteria 8 ( Fig. 5 ), since it is unlikely that our method failed to detect any archaea-specific major TFs families, as argued above.  Finally, we should point out another fact revealed in the present study. That is, all but one DBDs of known structure fall in the all-α type or class a in the SCOP classification ( Table 1 ). The only exception to this rule is the DBD of the BolA/YrbA family, which belongs to the α + β type (class d ) in SCOP. Remarkably TFs having DBDs of the all-α type, particularly HTH proteins, 7 are predominant throughout prokaryotes. This implies two things: one is the phylogenetic continuity of bacteria and archaea, and the other is a presumable dichotomy between prokaryotes and eukaryotes because TFs in eukaryotes are known to have various kinds of DBDs including those of the all-β type (class b ) as well as an abundance of zinc-finger types, 4 , 33 in addition to the all-α type such as the homeobox domain. Comparison of TFs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes will be the subject of our next report. The authors thank Dr Nobuyuki Fujita for the valuable advice.

IntroductionMost environmental microorganisms cannot be cultured easily under laboratory conditions. Genomes of uncultured organisms have remained mostly uncharacterized and are thought to contain a wide range of novel genes of scientific and industrial interest.1–6 Metagenomic approaches, which are analyses of mixed populations of uncultured microbes, have been developed to identify novel and industrially useful genes and to study microbial diversity in a wide variety of environments. With the metagenomic approach, genomic DNAs are extracted directly from an environmental sample containing multiple organisms, and the DNA fragments are cloned and sequenced. This is a powerful strategy for comprehensive analysis of biodiversity in an ecosystem.2,4–6 However, with a simple collection of many sequence fragments, it is difficult to predict from what phylotypes individual sequences are derived or the phylogenetic novelty of the individual sequences. This is because the conventional phylogenetic classification of sequences is based on sequence homology searches, which require orthologous sequence sets; therefore, this strategy cannot be applied to poorly characterized or novel sequences. In the present study, a new phylogenetic classification method that does not require the orthologs was developed on the basis of an unsupervised neural network algorithm, Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM).7,8 The conventional SOM was previously modified for genome informatics to make the learning process and resulting map independent of the order of data input,9,10 and the modified SOM method was developed for phylogenetic classification of genomic sequences from environmental and clinical samples. Sequence fragments derived from environmental samples of the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda11 could be classified into phylotypes.2. Materials and Methods2.1. SOM methodsWe previously modified the conventional Kohonen's SOM7,8 for genome informatics to make the learning process and resulting map independent of the order of data input.9,10 When we constructed the SOMs for di-, tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies in 10 kb genomic sequences from a wide range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the sequences were clustered primarily according to species without information regarding the species, and increasing the lengths of the oligonucleotides from di- to tetranucleotides increased the clustering power.9 In the present study, therefore, tri- and tetranucleotide SOMs were used according to the procedures as described previously.9 The initial weight vectors were defined by principal component analysis (PCA) instead of random values. Weight vectors (wij) were arranged in the 2D lattice denoted by i (= 0, 1, …, I − 1) and j (= 0, 1, …, J − 1). I was set as 350 and 550 in Figs 1 and 3, respectively, and J was defined by the nearest integer greater than (σ2/σ1) × I. σ1 and σ2 were the standard deviations of the first and second principal components, respectively. Weight vectors (wij) were set and updated as described previously.9 The batch-learning SOM program could be obtained from Xanagen, Inc. (Author Webpage; Email: info@xanagen.com) and G-inforBIO (Author Webpage).SOMs for non-overlapping 1 kb and overlapping 5 kb sequences of 81 prokaryotic genomes.

Nucleotide sequencesNucleotide sequences were obtained from Author Webpage. When the number of undetermined nucleotides (Ns) in a sequence exceeded 10% of the window size, the sequence was omitted from the analysis. When the number of Ns was <10%, the oligonucleotide frequencies were normalized to the length without Ns and included in the analysis.3. Results3.1. SOMs for species-known prokaryotesTo investigate the clustering power of SOM for a wide range of prokaryotic sequences, we first analyzed 81 prokaryotic genomes for which complete sequence is available (a total of 226 Mb). To avoid overrepresentation of specific genomes, one genome among different strains of one species or of closely related species was used. SOMs were constructed with tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies for 226 000 non-overlapping 1 kb and overlapping 5 kb sequences with a 1 kb sliding step. These short sequence fragments were tested because such short fragments can be cloned even from a small quantity of DNA samples difficult to be obtained, e.g. those from extreme environments. To define the initial weight vectors, tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies in the 226 000 sequences were analyzed by PCA as described previously.9,10 After 100 learning cycles, the tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies in the sequences were represented by the weight vectors on the tri- and tetranucleotide SOMs (Tri- and Tetra-SOMs in Fig. 1, see also Supplementary Figure). Then, lattice points that contained sequences from a single species are indicated in color, and those that included sequences from more than one species are indicated in black. The clustering power of the 5 kb SOM was much higher than that of the 1 kb SOM for both the Tri- and Tetra-SOMs, and the clustering power of the Tetra-SOM was higher than that of the Tri-SOM for the same sequence length (Table 1).The proportion (%) of colored lattice points and sequences belonging to the colored points.CL, the proportion (%) of colored lattice points, which contained sequences from a single species or group; SQ, The proportion (%) of sequences belonging to the colored lattice points.The proportion (%) of colored lattice points and sequences belonging to the colored points.CL, the proportion (%) of colored lattice points, which contained sequences from a single species or group; SQ, The proportion (%) of sequences belonging to the colored lattice points.SOM recognized in sequence fragments the key combinations of short oligonucleotide frequencies that are the signature feature of each genome12–15 and separated the sequences into species-specific territories without information regarding the species. In DNA databases, only one strand of a pair of complementary sequences is registered. Our previous analyses revealed that sequence fragments from a single prokaryotic genome are often split into two territories that reflect the transcriptional polarities of the genes present in the fragment.9 For phylogenetic classification of sequences from uncultured microbes, it is not necessary to know the transcriptional polarity of the sequence, and the split into two territories complicates assignment to species. Therefore, we tested a new type of SOM in which frequencies of a pair of complementary oligonucleotides (e.g. AACC and GGTT) were summed, and the SOMs for the degenerate sets of tri- and tetranucleotides were designated DegeTri- and DegeTetra-SOM, respectively. This nearly halved the computation time without loss of clustering power. The highest clustering power was observed for the 5 kb DegeTetra-SOM (Table 1), and therefore, this SOM is used for the later analysis of phylogenetic classification of novel sequences from environmental samples.3.2. Diagnostic oligonucleotides for species separationsAnalysis of the weight vectors of individual lattice points in Fig. 1 revealed that vectors with strongly biased frequencies were located on the edge of the map. The G + C% calculated from each lattice vector was reflected in the horizontal axis and increased from left to right in the 5 kb DegeTetra-SOM (G + C% in Fig. 2). In other words, sequences with high G + C% (red), which were derived primarily from GC-rich genomes, were clustered on the right side of the map. To visualize the species-specific patterns of oligonucleotide frequencies recognized by the SOM, the frequency of each pair of complementary tetranucleotides at each lattice point was calculated, divided into five level categories with an equal number of lattice points, and visualized with the level of red or blue; seven examples of the diagnostic patterns of the species separations are presented in Fig. 2. Transitions between red (overrepresentation) and blue (underrepresentation) for various tetranucleotides often coincided with borders for species separations. To clarify the biological implications of diagnostic tetranucleotides for the species separations, we examined association between the levels of palindromic tetranucleotides and restriction enzyme systems. We could identify 24 four-base cutter enzymes for the 81 prokaryotes analyzed, as referred to the REBASE restriction enzyme database (Author Webpage). The restriction site tetranucleotides were underrepresented for 23 of 24 enzymes (refer to blue zones noted with light blue arrows in palindromic tetranucleotide panels in Fig. 2). Underrepresentation of the restriction site tetranucleotides in the genome with the enzyme gene may be related to the potential danger for self-damage even in the presence of methylation systems. This result showed that the SOM effectively classified sequences according to biological categories, and a complex combination of many oligonucleotides should contribute to species separation. For example, wide varieties of oligonucleotide sequences are known to function as genetic signals (e.g. regulatory signals for gene expression), and some of the important signal sequences may be biased significantly toward non-random occurrence and presumably be diagnostic for species separation.Oligonucleotides related with species separation. The 5 kb DegeTetra-SOM presented in Fig. 1B. G + C%: G + C% calculated from the weight vector of individual lattice points in the 5 kb DegeTetra-SOM were divided into five level categories with an equal number of lattice points; and lattice points belonging to the categories of the highest, second-highest, middle, second-lowest and lowest G + C% are shown in dark red, light red, white, light blue and dark blue, respectively. Seven examples of diagnostic tetranucleotides for species separation are presented; five represent palindromic cases. Levels of each pair of complementary tetranucleotides calculated from individual lattice vectors were divided into five categories containing an equal number of lattice points, and the categories are shown as described above. Zones for species that have genes encoding a restriction enzyme that recognizes the respective tetranucleotide are noted by light blue arrows with the following numbers to show the species name: 1, H. pylori; 2, M. jannaschii; 3, F. nucleatum; 4, S. aureus; 5, L. lactis; 6, S. pneumoniae; 7, N. meningitidis.Oligonucleotides related with species separation.

Phylogenetic classification of species-known sequencesIn the phylogenetic classification of unculturable and poorly characterized species, classification into phylotypes rather than into individual species is important. Therefore, focusing on the DegeTetra-SOMs in Fig. 1A, we examined the classification of sequences from the 81 prokaryotes into 13 major phylotypes by referring to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) Taxonomy Database (Author Webpage). Lattice points that contained sequences from one phylotype are indicated in color, and those that included sequences from more than one phylotype are shown in black (Fig. 1B). The number of black points was lower than that of the species classification. On the 5 kb DegeTetra-SOM, 88% of the sequences were classified into the correct phylotype territory (Table 1), which was defined as a continuous territory represented by a single color for the phylotype. Species that showed close phylogenetic relations in one phylotype tended to have neighboring zones and produced a continuous territory in the phylotype classification. It should also be noted that different species belonging to one phylotype were often separated from each other. One cause of this separation was related to differences in genome G + C% between species of a single phylotype. For example, we observed a separation between GC- and AT-rich γ-proteobacteria ().It is worth noting that paired-end reads in DNA sequencing, such as two 500 nt sequences from one cloned fragment, can be used as a single 1 kb sequence in the calculation of oligonucleotide frequencies. When oligonucleotide frequencies were calculated and normalized for sequence length, 1 kb sequences could be mapped on the 5 kb SOM (1 kb on 5 kb SOM in Table 1). The proportions of 1 kb sequences classified into the correct phylotype were 69 and 85% on the 1 and 5 kb DegeTetra-SOMs, respectively, indicating that for phylogenetic classification of species-unknown sequences, even short sequences (e.g. 1 kb) must be mapped on an SOM constructed with longer species-known sequences (e.g. 5 kb). The increased hit level in mapping on the 5 kb SOM is presumably because the SOM can extract species-specific characteristics of oligonucleotide frequencies more accurately and because the statistical fluctuation of oligonucleotide frequencies decreases as the analyzed sequences become longer.For phylogenetic classification of novel sequences from environmental samples, SOMs should be constructed in advance with all available sequences of known species rather than only those from completely sequenced genomes. We thus constructed a DegeTetra-SOM with 210 000 non-overlapping 5 kb sequences (a total of 1.05 Gb) from 1502 species-known prokaryotes for which at least 10 kb of sequence has been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. These 1502 prokaryotes were classified into 25 phylotypes with reference to the NCBI Taxonomy Database. The classification according to phylotype was apparent (Species-known Seq. in Fig. 3A).Phylogenetic classification of environmental sequences.

Phylogenetic classification of environmental sequencesOne goal of metagenomic studies is to characterize and hopefully reconstruct multiple genomes, at least for dominant species in an environment, by sequencing a large number of DNA fragments obtained from an environmental sample. Such an approach should allow extensive surveys of sequences useful in scientific and industrial applications and assist in developing accurate views of the ecology of uncultured microbes. The traditional homology-based phylogenetic classification methods, however, have inevitably focused on well-characterized genes such as rDNA, for which orthologs from a wide range of phylotypes are available, but most well-characterized genes, including rDNA, are not industrially attractive. It would be best if microbial diversity could be assessed during the process of screening for novel genes with industrial and scientific significance. We developed such a method.Venter et al.11 applied shotgun sequencing to mixed genomes collected from the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda and deposited ∼811 000 sequence fragments (a total of 1 Gb) in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. These environmental sequences were analyzed with the newly developed SOM method. A majority of Sargasso sequence entries in the database corresponded to one-path read sequences; however, a limited number represented contigs assembled from multiple sequences derived from dominant genomes in this environment. We first selected 4258 entries of the contigs longer than 5 kb and mapped 34 000 fragments of 1 kb derived from these contigs on the aforementioned SOM constructed for the 1502 known prokaryotes (Sargasso Seq. >5 kb in Fig. 3A). Distinct clusters of Sargasso sequences were observed, and all dominant species reported previously11 were included in these clusters. We then mapped 218 400 fragments of 1 kb derived from 134 600 entries longer than 1 kb and all 811 000 sequences (Sargasso Seq. >1 kb and All Sargasso Seq. 3D, respectively). Although the sequences were not clustered tightly, skewed distributions were observed. This is more easily visualized with a 3D representation in which the number of Sargasso sequences classified into each lattice point is indicated by the height of a bar. Zones with abundant Sargasso sequences were located at the bottom left of the SOM, which is an area that contains AT-rich sequences. In the respective zone, the sizes of individual territories of known phylotypes were relatively small, and the territories were complex (Species-known Seq. in Fig. 3A), indicating that sequences from various poorly characterized species were crowded there. The A + T-rich Sargasso sequences derived from novel species might be mapped there because of the high heterogeneity for the species-known sequences in the respective zones.To investigate this possibility, we next constructed a DegeTetra-SOM with the species-known sequences plus Sargasso sequences longer than 1 kb. In addition, to confirm in silico reassociation of sequences derived from a single genome but cloned independently in a metagenomic library, we included sequence fragments derived from microbe mixtures in an acidophilic biofilm growing in acid mine drainage16 which is a worldwide environmental problem. Because of low-complexity of the mixed genomes, Tyson et al.16 focused on this biofilm in order to reconstruct dominant genomes with shotgun sequencing of the metagenomic library. In the ‘Species-known and environmental Seq.’ panel in Fig. 3B, lattice points that contained only Sargasso or biofilm sequences are indicated by () or (), respectively; those that contained sequences from a single known phylotype are colored as described in Fig. 3A; and those that included sequences from more than one phylotype or both environmental and species-known sequences are shown in black. Most of the biofilm sequences derived from the low-complexity metagenome library were located in a few distinct territories (Biofilm Seq. in Fig. 3B), confirming that most sequence fragments derived from a single genome but cloned independently can be reassociated in silico. This can provide the rationale for phylogenetic classification of sequences derived from a high-complexity library such as the Sargasso sequences. The territories of species-known sequences in Fig. 3B shrank appreciably when compared with those in Fig. 3A, indicating that a large portion of Sargasso sequences had oligonucleotide frequencies distinct from those of species-known prokaryotes. The number of Sargasso sequences classified into lattice points containing no species-known sequences is indicated by the height of the () bar (Sargasso Seq. unclassified in Fig. 3B); 79% of the Sargasso sequences belonged to this phylotype-unclassified category. These Sargasso sequences should correspond to sequences derived from genomes that are poorly characterized at the present moment. The remaining 21% of Sargasso sequences were associated with species-known sequences (black lattices in Species-known and environmental Seq. in Fig. 3B). The number of Sargasso sequences classified into lattice points containing sequences only from a single phylotype regarding species-known sequences is indicated by the height of the bar colored to indicate the phylotype (Sargasso Seq. classified). On our Web page (Author Webpage), 92 genera, whose sequences were associated with the Sargasso sequences, are listed together with numbers of the associated Sargasso sequences. It should be noted that most of the Sargasso sequences have not been characterized phylogenetically because there were no orthologs for these novel sequences. Detailed phylotype predictions for individual Sargasso sequences with the SOM method are available on our Web page (Author Webpage).4. DiscussionG + C% has been used for a long period as a fundamental parameter for phylogenetic classification of microbes, but the G + C% is apparently too simple a parameter to differentiate a wide variety of known species. Oligonucleotide frequency can be used to distinguish genomes because oligonucleotide frequencies vary significantly among genomes.12–15 The present phylogenetic classification is designed as an extension of one parameter ‘G + C%’ to the multiple parameters ‘oligonucleotide frequencies’ utilizing SOM. In the case of the homology-based phylogenetic classification, a set of orthologous sequences from a wide range of species is an absolute requirement, and therefore, the conventional method is difficult to apply to the classification of novel sequences from poorly characterized species. Because the SOM does not require the orthologs, the present strategy can enhance novel metagenomic studies of uncultured microbes.17,18 For example, the method can be applied to analyses of microbial and viral sequences derived from clinical specimens (feces and phlegm), including sterilized ones. If SOMs are constructed in advance with a large number of sequences from a wide variety of clinical samples systematically collected from various sources plus sequences from all known species, this technique may be used to screen unidentified pathogenic microorganisms responsible for poorly characterized infectious diseases.When we consider phylogenetic classification of sequences from uncultured microbes in a very complex ecosystem, it will become important to construct SOMs in advance with all prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences available. For example, a certain portion of Sargasso sequences may be derived from eukaryotic genomes such as those of fungi, protozoa and fishes. Furthermore, when microorganisms that have symbiotic/parasitic relation with a macroorganism are studied, sequences from the macroorganism may be included in the sequence collection. Specimens in medical studies may also contain various eukaryotic DNAs. To test the SOM separation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences with special reference to Sargasso sequences, we constructed a DegeTetra-SOM with 5 kb sequences from the 1502 prokaryotes plus those from 11 unicellular eukaryotes (6 fungi and 5 protozoa) and zebrafish (Fig. 4A). The power of SOM to separate prokaryotic from eukaryotic sequences was very high; only 0.1% prokaryotic sequences were classified into eukaryotic territories. Furthermore, separation among eukaryotic species was apparent (Eukaryote Seq. separately colored). Next we mapped Sargasso sequences longer than 1 kb on this SOM (Sargasso Seq. mapped). Although a major portion of the Sargasso sequences were classified into specific prokaryote territories, 9.9% were classified into eukaryotic territories that corresponded mainly to territories of unicellular eukaryotes; 13 times more densely in unicellular eukaryote territories than in the zebrafish territory.SOMs for prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences and for 16S rDNAs. (A) SOM was constructed with 211 000 and 210 600 5 kb sequences of 1502 prokaryotes and 12 eukaryotes, respectively. Prokaryote Seq. separately colored: lattice points that contain sequences from a single prokaryotic phylotype are indicated in colors as described in Fig. 3A; those that contain only eukaryotic sequences are indicated in color (SOMs for prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences and for 16S rDNAs. (A) SOM was constructed with 211 000 and 210 600 5 kb sequences of 1502 prokaryotes and 12 eukaryotes, respectively. Prokaryote Seq. separately colored: lattice points that contain sequences from a single prokaryotic phylotype are indicated in colors as described in Fig. 3A; those that contain only eukaryotic sequences are indicated in color (Genome segments introduced through horizontal gene transfer from a phylogenetically distant genome tend to retain the sequence characteristics of the donor genome and can be distinguished from those of the host genome. Even in the 5 kb DegeTetra-SOM in Fig. 1B, there are lattice points marked in black which should contain sequences with tetranucleotide frequencies distinct from the major portion of the host genome. Such sequences may correspond, at least in part, to segments transferred horizontally from a distant phylotype. When we investigated Bacillus subtilis sequences located outside the Firmicutes territory, we found that many were derived from pathogenic islands where prophage- and foreign-type sequences are clustered.19 The SOM, as well as the sequence homology-based method, may classify such horizontally transferred sequences into the donor genome. Although the information regarding horizontal transfer is interesting, it creates problems in phylogenetic classification of environmental sequences. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a strategy to address this problem. When we constructed Tetra- and DegeTetra-SOMs with 38 660 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) sequences longer than 1 kb from 19 196 known prokaryotes available in GenBank, clear clustering according to phylotype was found with reference to the NCBI Taxonomy Database; 97 and 95% of sequences were classified into the correct phylotype territory on the Tetra- and DegeTetra-SOMs, respectively, and the result of the Tetra-SOM is presented (Species-known 16S rDNA in Fig. 4B). The reason why the hit level of Tetra-SOM is slightly higher than that of the DegeTetra-SOM may be attributable to the fact that rDNA sequences with the same polarity are registered in GenBank for all species. This is in contrast with the situation for usual genomic sequences. The SOM may detect details of sequence characteristics of 16S rDNAs that can be identified only in sequences with the same polarity.When we focused on 16S rDNA sequences from species-unidentified prokaryotes in GenBank, we found 16 652 sequences longer than 1 kb. Because the main purpose of 16S rDNA sequencing of the unidentified prokaryotes in environments is phylogenetic assignment, phylotypes assigned with the homology-based method are often annotated in GenBank. We selected 6855 sequences for which classification into major phylotypes is annotated and mapped these sequences on the species-known 16S rDNA Tetra-SOM (Species-unknown 16S rDNA in Fig. 4B). Lattice points that contained sequences of a single phylotype annotated are indicated in color representing the phylotype, and those that included sequences from more than one phylotype are indicated in black. The major zones were marked in color, and the color pattern was almost identical to that of known species. Although the SOM does not require sequence alignments, assignments were practically identical to those obtained by the homology-based method for this case where a large number of orthologous sequences are available. When extensive shotgun sequencing of an environmental sample is done, substantial amounts of both non-rDNA and rDNA sequences become available. Combined SOM analyses of rDNA and non-rDNA sequences may provide detailed information regarding microbial diversity on the basis of detailed knowledge of rDNA phylogeny. This may also solve, at least in part, complications caused by horizontal transfer of sequences. For example, when no rDNA sequences are found in a certain phylotype territory in the rDNA SOM, but a statistically significant number of non-rDNA sequences is found in the respective phylotype territory in the SOM constructed with usual genomic sequences, these non-rDNA sequences may be candidates for horizontally transferred sequences. When a statistically significant number of rDNA sequences map to a certain phylotype territory in the rDNA SOM and is assigned to be derived from one species with the homology-based method on the basis of the detailed rDNA phylogeny, a major portion of the non-rDNA sequences mapped to this phylotype territory on the standard SOM can be predicted to be derived from the respective species. Collectively, the combination of SOMs for rDNA and non-rDNA sequences will reconstruct in silico the rDNA and non-rDNA sequences derived from a single genome but cloned independently.Supplementary materialSupplementary material is available online at Author WebpageThis work was supported by grants from ACT-Japan Science and Technology Corporation and the Advanced and Innovational Research Program in Life Sciences and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Applied Genome’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

Introduction More than 200 microbial complete genome sequences are now available from publicly accessible databases, such as DDBJ at the National Institute of Genetics ( Author Webpage ), GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( Author Webpage ) and EMBL-EBI at European Bioinformatics Institute ( Author Webpage ). 1 Among them, two prokaryotes, the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli , as well as the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been used extensively as model organisms for basic biological research. 2–4 Complete genome sequence revealed that although these microorganisms are among the most thoroughly studied genetic systems, <50% of their respective genes had been characterized experimentally. Genome sequence data are valuable resources not only for information complementary to traditional biological approaches but for development of new approaches known as ‘functional genomics’, a research area of computational analysis of complete genomes, followed by experimental testing of emerging hypotheses. 5 , 6 Genome sequence information throws new light on the nature and interrelationship among bacterial genes, including ancestries, gene families, modules and motifs in comparative terms. 7–9 Comparison of the chromosomal location of genes within and between species might also reveal aspects of genome evolution and functional coupling between genes. 10–12 Detailed information on the structure and function of genome and of individual gene products in particular are most abundant and comprehensive for E. coli , and approximately half of the gene products have been characterized by using a variety of genetical, biochemical and molecular biological techniques. On the basis of extensive data resulting from these analyses, genes of known function were classified into a number of distinct categories. 13 The importance of E. coli genome as a leading model system seems to have gained rapid recognition for future studies of functional genomics and systems biology.  To further clarify the nature of genes with unknown function, however, a variety of resources, such as individual cloned genes, disruption or deletion mutants for each of the predicted genes would be particularly useful. Complete genome sequence data permitted to construct such resources in Mycoplasma genitalium , Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . 14–17 Construction of genome-wide clones in E. coli has a long history including plasmid clones, 18 cosmid library, 19–21 and phage lambda clones. 22 , 23 Furthermore, increasing number of proteins, called ‘moonlighting proteins’, having two or more distinct functions are accumulating recently. 24 It would therefore be a good opportunity to reevaluate reported function of known genes and to explore new function by using large-scale resources such as cloned genes reported here as well as deletion and other mutants.  Here, we describe a complete clone set of genes in Escherichia coli that should allow us to perform systematic functional analyses not only of genes of unknown function but of those of known function to survey their function. Each of the predicted ORF except start and stop codons was amplified by PCR followed by cloning into multicopy plasmid vector. Each product is Histidine tagged at its N-terminal end and GFP fused at its C-terminal. Expression of cloned genes is directed by the P  T5- lac promoter that can be activated by IPTG but normally repressed by  lacI q placed in cis . 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Strains and growth conditionsE. coli K-12, strain AG1 [ recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 (  r K− m K+ ) supE44 relA1 ] that exhibits high transformation efficiency, purchased from Stratagene, Inc. was used for all plasmid construction and other experiments.  Cells were usually grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium [1% Bacto Tryptone (BD Diagnostic Systems), 0.5% yeast extract (BD Diagnostic Systems), 0.5% NaCl] containing 50 µg/ml of ampicillin (Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd), 30 µg/ml of kanamycin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) or chloramphenicol (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) as required. Isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside (IPTG) was used at 0.1 mM to induce expression of cloned gene. 2.2. PCR primers A pair of PCR primers was designed to amplify each of the predicted ORFs of E. coli which starts from the second codon to the last amino acid codon omitting the initiation and termination codons. Each primer contains 3 or 2 additional bases at its 5′ end followed by 20 or 21 bases of ORF-specific sequence for the N- or C-terminus, respectively. Additional nucleotides were included to facilitate directional cloning and to generate Sfi I restriction sites. Thus, all N-terminal primers have the sequence 5′-GCC(20N)-3′, where 20N is specific for each ORF beginning at the second codon. Similarly, all C-terminal primers have the sequence 5′-(21N)CC-3′, where 21N is specific to each ORF ending with the last amino acid codon. The resulting PCR fragment has the sequence of 5′-GCC-2nd through amino acid codon -GG-3′. All primers were phosphorylated before use in PCR reaction.  In the following special cases, primer sequences were modified to circumvent fortuitous generation of Sfi I restriction sites. (i) If the sequence of ORF happens to be ATG NNN NNG GCC N….N NNN GGC CNN NNN TAA, the PCR-amplified fragment would be GCC NNN NNG GCC N….N NNN GGC CNN NNN GG and the resultant plasmid after cloning would have the sequence ‘… GGCCCTGAG(GGCC NNN NNG GCC) N….N NNN GGC CNN NNN (GGCC TATGCGGCC)…’, generating additional Sfi I sites (underlined) besides these at the peripheries (in parentheses). To avoid this complication, the G residue of the third NNG codon was replaced by an appropriate residue without changing the amino acid encoded, and the third residue of the last amino acid codon was changed from GGC to GGT.  If the third residue of the last amino acid codon is G, and the ORF sequence is ‘ATG NN….NN NNG TAA’, the PCR-amplified fragment would have the sequence ‘GCC ATG NN….NN NNG GG’, and this fragment has an Sfi I site even if the last G residue was unexpectedly removed by exonuclease activity contaminated with polymerase or restriction enzyme. To avoid this, the last amino acid codon was replaced by a synonymous codon which lacks G at the third residue. However, when the last codon was Met(ATG) or Trp(TGG), no modification was made because of the lack of done synonymous codon. 2.3. PCR amplification PCR amplification reaction was performed in 96-formatted well plates. To minimize PCR errors during amplification, 1 U of KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO CO., Ltd.) was used in 25 µl reaction mixture containing 20–30 ng Kohara phage clone DNA or E. coli genomic DNA, 1.0 µM of each primer and 200 µM dNTPs. A recombinant form of Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD DNA Polymerase having 3′→5′ exonuclease-dependent proofreading activity and exhibits very high fidelity was used. 25 , 26 Reactions were performed according to manufacturer's instruction and the amplified fragments were blunt-ended by using KOD polymerase. PCR reactions were run by 25 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 64°C for 15 s, 72°C for 4 min followed by a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min. All reactions were performed by an automatic sequencing reaction robot PRIZM877 (Applied BioSystems) to avoid errors arising from manual operation. About 99% of ORFs (4217) could be successfully amplified by KOD DNA polymerase; many of the unsuccessful ORFs were >2 kb, and most of them (∼90%) could be amplified by DynaZyme (Finzymes Oy). The remaining ORFs (∼1% of total) could be prepared by using LATaq DNA polymerase (TAKARA BIO, Inc.).2.4. PCR fragment purificationAll PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.7–1.5% gel) in 1× TAE buffer depending on the length of amplified fragments. Gels were stained with SyberGOLD (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and visualized by 480 nm light to minimize DNA damage. Images were then photographed and checked for their sizes. PCR products of expected size were cut out and eluted by using MagExtractor (TOYOBO Co., Ltd) according to the manufacturer's instruction.2.5. Cloning of individual ORFs into pCA24N vector DNA fragments purified by agarose gel electrophoresis were individually ligated with vector pCA24N DNA that had been digested with Stu I and dephosphorylated. Ligation was performed for 1 h at 16°C by using ligation kit (TAKARA BIO, Inc.). The ligated DNA was ethanol precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, vacuum dried, and resuspended in 10 µl of H 2 O. DNA solution (1 µl) was used for electro-transformation, selecting for chloramphenicol resistance on LB plate. Competent cells (50 µl) prepared according to Laboratory Manuals 27 were mixed with 1 µl of DNA solution in an ice-cold 0.2-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), treated at 2.5 kV with 25 mF and 200-ohms, followed by addition of 1 ml of SOC medium (2% Bacto Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MgSO 4 , 20 mM glucose). Cells were then transferred to each of 96 formatted deep wells, and allowed to recover for 1 h at 37°C with shaking at 250 r.p.m. before plating on selective media. 2.6. Confirmation of structure of ORF clones Plasmid clones were purified by 96 well format Multi Screen Plasmid DNA purification kit (Millipore Corporation) and their structure was confirmed by digestion with Bgl I or Sfi I restriction enzyme and examining by agarose gel electrophoresis. Clones having expected gel pattern were further analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products made by using pCA-F primer 5′-GGCGTATCACGAGGCCCTTTCGTCTTCACC-3′ and pCA-R3 primer 5′-TTGCATCACCTTCACCCTCTCCACTGACAG-3′. The primers used for sequencing were F-CA primer 5′-CATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGAGAGG-3′ from His-tagged side, and R-CA primer 5′-CATCTAATTCAACAAGAATTGGGACAACTC-3′ from GFP side. The sequencing reaction was performed using ABI PRISM model 377, 3700 or 3730, according to the standard Big-dye protocol (Applied BioSystems). 2.7. GFP fluorescenceColonies were formed on LB plates containing 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol with (1 mM) or without IPTG. GFP fluorescence of individual colonies was visualized by 480 nm light and photographed by IMAGE FREEZER AE-6905 (ATTO CORPORATION).2.8. Protein purification Cells producing Histidine-tagged protein from the clone were grown at 37°C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol to OD 600 0.3. Samples were taken 2 h after the addition of 1 mM IPTG. The cells were collected by centrifugation (10 000 r.p.m. × 3 min at 4°C) and resuspended in 400 µl of cold buffer I [50 mM Sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 200 mM NaCl, Proteinase inhibitor (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd)]. Thereafter, all manipulations were done at 4°C. Crude cell extracts were obtained by sonication (5 × 5 s, level 3, Astrason ultrasonic processor) and centrifugation (16 000 r.p.m. × 15 min). Crude cell extracts were loaded onto a 30 µl Nickel (Ni 2+ )-column [prepared according to manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN, Inc) and equilibrated with buffer I]. Affinity chromatography of the extracts was performed at 4°C. Loaded columns were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer 2 [Buffer I contains 20 mM imidazole and 0.05% n -octyl-β-glucoside (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc)] and proteins were eluted with buffer 3 [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT, 6 M Urea and 250 mM imidazole]. Eluted proteins were analyzed by 7.5–15% gradient SDS–PAGE (BIOCRAFT Co., Ltd.) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. 3. Results and Discussions3.1. Construction of cloning vector pCA24N To clone all the genes of Escherichia coli , we constructed a plasmid vector with the following properties: (i) high copy number plasmid, (ii) IPTG-inducible expression of cloned ORF repression of expression by  lacI q , (iii) Histidine tag attached to the N-terminal end of ORF, (iv) in-frame fusion with GFP at the C-terminal end, (v) generation of Sfi I restriction sites at both boundaries of cloned ORF ( Fig. 1 ) (see below). The construction of pCA24N is shown schematically in Fig. 2 . Expression of a target ORF inserted at the Stu I site is directed by the IPTG-inducible promoter, P  T5- lac . Each ORF is fused in-frame with Histidine tag 7 spacer amino acids at the N-terminal end ( Fig. 3 ).  Generation of Sfi I sites by cloning a target ORF only in correct direction. The top line is the cloning site of pCA24N. To clone a target ORF, blunt-ended PCR-amplified protein-coding region with three (GCC) and two (GG) additional nucleotides at the N- and C-terminal, respectively, was inserted into the Stu I site (filled triangle). Ligation of blunt-ended 5′-GCCXXX…XXXGG-3′ fragment (X indicates nucleotides of target gene) generates Sfi I sites at both boundaries of the fragment when the ligation was done in correct direction (left) but not in opposite direction (right). Open arrows show PCR-amplified fragments with arrowhead indicating direction of the ORF.  Generation of Sfi I sites by cloning a target ORF only in correct direction.

The blunt-ended 4.1 kb Bam HI and Sac I fragment of pQB2, 39 was ligated with the kanamycin resistance fragment ( kan ) that had been amplified from pHSG299, 40 by using the oligo DNA primers: 5′-CGGCCCTGAGGCCTTCAACTCAGCAAAAGTTCG-3′ and 5′-GGCCATATAGGCCTGAATGGCGAATGCGATTTATTC-3′ to create pQA2-Km. To prepare a fragment having a  lacI q and terminator, pGEX-2TK, 41 was digested by Aat II and Eam I and blunt ended. The resulting  lacI q fragment was ligated with blunt-ended Bam HI chloramphenicol resistance fragment of pNK2884, 42 to create pCX2TK1. Blunt-ended Aat II and Nhe I fragment of pQA2-Km and Sma I– Fsp I blunt-end fragment was ligated to create pCA21. Original GFP is heat labile and have weak or no fluorescence at 37°C or higher temperature. To replace the original GFP by the heat tolerant mutant form, the Stu I– Sma I fragment of pCA21 was ligated with PCR-amplified GFP fragment from pGFPgcn4, 28 by oligo DNA primers having Not I restriction site: 5′-CCTATGCGGCCGCAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC-3′ and 5′-TTAGCGGCCGCTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC-3′. Not I sites of both primers were designed for removal of GFP after cloning. The replication origin and Histidine tag of the resultant vector, named pCA24N, were derived from pGEX-2TK and pQE31 (parental plasmid of pQB2) respectively.  Vector construction.

The bottom nucleotide and amino acid sequences indicate the predicted final structure around the site of cloned ORF.

The gene encoding a mutated form of GFP 28 was placed immediately downstream of ORF so as to produce fusion protein. This is mainly for detecting localization of protein product in the host cell. GFP was also supposed to serve as an indicator for correct cloning of amplified ORF DNA. It was designed, however, to permit removal of the ORF after removing GFP by digestion with Not I enzyme followed by self-ligation. The final structure of the cloned ORF after removing GFP is shown in Fig. 4 . Clones that have Not I restriction site(s) within ORF can be prepared separately by using partial digestion with Not I enzyme.  Removal of GFP fragment by Not I digestion. Each ORF clone has two Not I sites, one at the C-terminal spacer region (within Sfi I #2) and region directly next to the termination codon of GFP gene.

Most of them (4267 out of 4276 ORFs) were successfully cloned into pCA24N in-frame and in correct orientation: 3 out of 9 unsuccessful ORFs, yhcQ , yibP and aidB , could be cloned only in opposite direction probably because even small amount of leak expression from P  T5- lac promoter or upstream region is toxic for the host cell. Remaining six ORFs, eaeH (7104 bp), yheB (2694 bp), yhiH (2685 bp), yagF (1968 bp), ydbD (2313 bp) and btuB (1845 bp), were failed to be amplified by PCR reaction partly due to their length to be amplified. btuB mRNA was reported to form complex structure to control binding to ribosome and its translation. 29 This might interfere to be amplified by PCR reaction.  The purified PCR-amplified fragments were then ligated into StuI site of pCA24N vector. After overnight incubation at 37°C, eight colonies were picked out for each ORF and suspended in 1 ml fresh LB medium in 96 formatted deep well, and were also streaked on 1 mM IPTG containing LB plates at 37°C to check in-frame cloning by observing growth and GFP fluorescence upon overproduction of GFP fusion protein encoded by each ORF. After overnight incubation at 37°C, plasmid DNA was extracted and purified by using Multi Screen DNA purification kit, digested with Sfi I or Bgl I restriction enzymes, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Four independent clones, that have the expected structures, were chosen and stored as a DNA mixture to minimize loss of intrinsic genetic information during PCR amplification. Boundaries of cloning sites were confirmed by sequencing. 3.3. Growth inhibition by IPTG induction To investigate the influence of over-supply of target gene products, we induced expression of ORF by growing patches of cells on LB agar medium supplemented with or without 1 mM IPTG at 37°C. Out of 4269 ORFs tested, 3301 ORFs showed some growth inhibitory effects by IPTG induction ( Fig. 5 ). Out of these ORFs, 2149 ORFs showed severe growth defects: 1158 ORFs were predicted to have membrane-spanned domain and as membrane proteins. Of 1158 plausible membrane proteins, 1032 ORFs showed severe growth defects when overproduced.  Effects on growth and GFP fluorescence by IPTG induction. Effects of growth by 1 mM IPTG induction on LB agar plate at 37°C were classified into three categories. The numbers represent the ratio of each of the classified ORFs against the total ORFs of E. coli .  Effects on growth and GFP fluorescence by IPTG induction. Effects of growth by 1 mM IPTG induction on LB agar plate at 37°C were classified into three categories. The numbers represent the ratio of each of the classified ORFs against the total ORFs of E. coli . 3.4. Use of ORF clones First, we tried to construct cDNA microarray by using ORF clones as DNA templates for PCR amplification. These clones not only function as templates for PCR amplification by one set of common oligo DNA primers for every target ORF, but are also found to serve as an appropriate source for DNA template and provided a stable supply of DNA fragment. E.coli DNA microarray is now commercially available from TAKARA BIO, Inc. The applications using these microarrays have been already published. 30–34 The present vector was designed as an efficient expression vector, and protein product of each clone can be easily induced by IPTG in quantity and purified by using Ni-or Co- NTA column ( Fig. 6 ). Some proteins, especially most of the membrane proteins, had difficulties to be purified by this method. Few cytosolic proteins showed similar difficulties to be purified. One possibility is that His-tag could not function because of N-terminal 3D-structure. His-tag proteins attached with its C-terminal should be also considered. These purified proteins are also good resource for further analysis, such as protein biochemistry, crystallography and antigens for antibody production. Furthermore, analysis of co-purified proteins with His-tagged cloned ORF would reveal candidates of interacting proteins. This analysis by using mass-spectrometry for efficient identification of interacting proteins is now underway systematically. Protein purification by using Ni-NTA column after IPTG induction. The plasmids used to over-express Histidine-tagged proteins were from ASKA library. From 3 ml culture induced by adding 0.1 mM IPTG for 2 h, His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA column. The whole eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS–PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Some proteins (CodB, SucC and SucD) were hardly purified by this method.Protein purification by using Ni-NTA column after IPTG induction.

Protein localization is undoubtedly one of the important information about protein product to understand its function. When induced by adding IPTG, however, 62% of total ORF clones showed growth inhibition to the host cell. And in some cases, IPTG induction might lead to form inclusion body. To avoid these artificial effects, cells were grown without IPTG. pCA24N vector has  lacI q for strict suppression of the expression from P  T5- lac promoter without IPTG growth condition; however, very few proportion of the cells showed fluorescence from GFP probably because of leaky expression. After pilot tests by using clones that were known for their cellular localization, this analysis was carried out on the systematic stage (Niki, H., personal communication and kindly provided pictures, Fig. 7 ).  GFP fluorescence image of a cell. These images of cells having an ftsZ and codB gene of our clones were taken by CCD camera without any induction by adding IPTG. The GFP fluorescence is from leaks of transcription from the promoter. The result is consistent with previous observation. 43 Pictures were kindly provided by Dr. Niki, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan.  GFP fluorescence image of a cell.

Deletion mutation of the target gene might reveal its physiological function by loss of function but clone might also give us many suggestions of its function by over supply of the target gene product. Applications by using clones have been already published elsewhere. 35–383.5. Distribution of clones Clones are freely available to use for academic purposes with agreement for material transfer and planned to be distributed from multiple sites in Japan and other countries. Initially, these clones are available from Nara Institute of Science and Technology and requests are accepted through our web page ( Author Webpage ). 3.6. Quality control and related informationTo fix the ORF prediction, not only for functional annotation but also for coding region, from a genome sequence is difficult problem and always under evolving stage. To improve the quality of our plasmid clone library, we have been keeping efforts to re-construct target ORF clones based on the latest ORF prediction. In November 2003, the annotation of E. coli genes by international consortium was started according to the correction of genome sequence of E. coli by Japanese group organized by Horiuchi (Hayashi, K., Morooka, N., Otsubo, E. et al., manuscript in preparation). Recently, more accurate ORF prediction and annotation was fixed as the first version by the consortium (Riley, M. et al., manuscript in preparation). The total number of ORFs or ORF fragments of E. coli K-12 W3110 strain is 4364. Out of 4364 ORFs, 77 were predicted as pseudogenes caused by IS insertion or frameshift mutation. Excluding these pseudogenes and IS or phage-related ORFs, 3986 newly assigned ORFs are required to be established as plasmid clones as ASKA library. According to this information, we found ∼900 plasmid clones in our library to be required for minor modification mainly at their start sites, and almost all have been already modified and ready for use. At the same time, we tried to read whole sequence of the fragment cloned to check the PCR error and keep one correct clone if available.  As mentioned in Materials and Methods, previous stock of clones are mixture of multiple up to four independent candidates of each target ORF, that had been confirmed their structure by restriction enzyme and sequencing from both side. Some of them might have PCR errors and we will keep efforts to eliminate such kind of errors by sequencing and re-cloning. The latest information about ASKA library is available through our web page ( Author Webpage ).

IntroductionPlant genetics has experienced a drastic change in the last decade with the emergence of genomics. A large quantity of genomic and cDNA sequences have been accumulated and systematic analyses of gene function have been conducted at a genome-wide scale based on the available sequence information. Identification and isolation of causative genes for a variety of mutants have been accelerated by the use of genomic libraries and DNA markers that are generated in association with sequence analysis. Fusion of conventional genetics and genomics is typical in two well-known model plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa L. (rice), and in several major crop plants to a lesser extent but has not been very widespread in other plant species including a variety of agronomically important plants. To understand the genetic systems in the plant kingdom and be of benefit to plant breeding processes, collection of genome-wide information and subsequent adoption of genomic approaches in a diversity of plants is urgently needed.In the legume family, genomics and molecular genetics have rapidly advanced for the last several years with a central focus on two model legume species, Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula.1 These species are closely related to two forage legume crops, birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), respectively, and it is anticipated that their genomic and genetic information can be applied to crop legumes, including forage crops. Several comparative analyses among legumes have been reported 2–6 and have demonstrated that genomic and genetic information of model plants may be beneficial for crop breeding. To facilitate such comparison and subsequent transfer of information among model legumes, the availability of genomic information and genomic resources for each species is a prerequisite. These resources would also be useful to investigate genetic systems specific to individual crop legumes.Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is an important forage legume widely cultivated in most temperate regions because of its characteristics of high seedling vigor, rapid growth, and tolerance to acidic and humid conditions. It is also used as a green manure crop because of its high nutrient content resulting partly from symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium. Red clover has a diploid genome (2n = 2x = 14), with a DNA content of 0.97 pg/2C,7 which is slightly larger than that of rice.7 Several studies have shown that the genome of red clover is extremely polymorphic due to its strongly self-incompatibile fertilization. In fact, intra-population genomic heterozygosity was higher than inter-population heterozygosity.8–10 The genetic diversity of red clover has been intensively studied using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers.11,12 The high level of heterozygosity has hampered intensive genetic and genomic analyses of red clover. Recently, the first genetic linkage map with 256 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers was constructed,13 while in another Trifolium species, the white clover Trifolium repens, a genetic map with 566 microsatellite markers was reported.14In this study, we investigated the genome structure of red clover using a variety of genomic technologies including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic and cDNA library construction and sequencing. In parallel, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map of the entire genome with a large number of DNA markers, which is invaluable for genome comparison, map-based gene identification and isolation, and marker-assisted breeding. We specifically focused on microsatellite markers associated with protein-coding genes, which are more informative and useful than those randomly distributed in the genome, in combination with a user-friendly and cost-effective detection system. Furthermore, transferability of these markers to other germplasms was examined to assess the feasibility of using these markers in selective breeding of red clover. In addition, macrosynteny with the genomes of two model legumes, L. japonicus and M. truncatula, was investigated using the developed microsatellite markers to explore the possibility of sharing knowledge among red clover, models and related crop plants.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materialsA cDNA library was constructed from the Japanese red clover variety ‘Hokuseki’.15 A genetic linkage map was constructed using a mapping population of 188 F1 individuals derived from a double-pseudo test cross between HR as the female parent and R130 as the male parent. HR is an elite plant selected from early progenies between ‘Hokuseki’ and a Swiss variety ‘Renova’ with characteristics of early flowering, erect shape, red flower color and middle-sized leaves. R130 is a progeny of a mapping population used in the development of the previously reported RFLP map,13 originating from a Russian variety and a wild variety from the Archangelsk region (approximately N 65°, E 40°), which exhibits late flowering, semi-prostrate shape, white flower color and small leaves.2.2. Flow cytometryNuclear DNA content was measured by flow cytometry according to the method described by Galbraith et al.16 and Ito et al.17, with minor modifications. The nuclei were isolated from fully expanded leaves of red clover and young leaves of A. thaliana, to provide a reference sample, by chopping the leaf tissues and filtering the minced tissue through double-layered nylon meshes (20 and 50 µm pore size). Nuclear samples were stained with 41.7 µg/ml of propidium iodide for 60 min, and then analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) according to Ito et al.17. More than 800 nuclei were measured with a minimum of triplicate analyses performed for each plant.2.3. Generation of BAC librariesGenomic DNA of HR was partially digested with MboI and cloned into CopyControl pCC1BAC (Epicentre, WI, USA.) according to the previously described method.18 Two independent libraries containing genomic segments of different size ranges, 108 and 80 kb on average, were generated. Three-dimensional (3-D) DNA pools for PCR screening were generated as described previously.182.4. Chromosome analysis of condensation pattern and FISHChromosome samples for microscopic observation were prepared as previously reported.19 Briefly, root tips of red clover were treated in 2 mM quinolin at room temperature for 4 h, followed by fixation in ethanol : acetic acid (3 : 1). On the next day, the tips were washed thoroughly and subjected to enzymatic maceration in a cocktail of 2.5% Pectolyase Y-23 (Seishin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Japan) and 1% Cellulase Onozuka RS (Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd, Japan), and incubated in a thermal bath at 37°C for 40 min. The tips were then macerated in a few drops of methanol : acetic acid (1 : 1) fixative using the tips of a fine forceps and air dried on glass slides.The 28S rDNA, the 5S rDNA and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones representing each linkage group were used as probes for FISH analysis. The 28S and the 5S rDNA probes were produced by PCR using primer pairs designed based on the rRNA and 5S RNA gene sequences in the red clover genome. The BAC probes were selected from the 3-D DNA pools of the BAC libraries by PCR using the primer pairs to amplify simple sequence repeats (SSRs).The FISH analysis using rRNA genes and the BAC clones were performed on well-prepared chromosome spreads according to the method described previously by Ohmido et al.20, with modifications. The chromosome spread on glass slides, prepared as described above, were incubated in 100% ethanol at 90°C for 2 min and air dried. They were denatured in 70% formamide/2 × SSC at 70°C for 4 min, and then dehydrated in a series of 70 and 100% cooled ethanol for 5 min each and air dried. After hybridization with digoxigenin- or biotin-labeled probes at 37°C for 8–48 h, slides were incubated with Sheep-Anti-Dig FITC (Roche, Switzerland) and StreptAvidin-cy3 (Jackson Immuno. Res. Lab, USA) in 4 × SSC at 37°C for 30 min in a humid dark box, followed by incubation in 4 × SSC at 37°C for 30 min in the dark with Anti-sheep FITC (Vector Labs, USA) and StreptAvidin-cy3 to amplify the signal. After washing in 2 × SSC and air drying, the chromosome sample was stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI in Vectashield.The preparations were observed under a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX50) equipped with a sensitive cooled CCD camera (PXL1400), and the prometaphase chromosome spreads with clear patterns were photographed by blue or green light excitation and emission filters. Captured images were digitally stored in a computer and analyzed using the CHIAS3 imaging software.212.5. Random sequencing of the genomeThe total cellular DNA was extracted from leaves of HR using a DNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen, The Netherlands). The obtained DNA was segmented by sonication and size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA fragments of ∼2 kb long were cloned into the HincII site of M13mp18 followed by introduction into Escherichia coli ElectroTen-Blue (Stratagene, USA) by electroporation. Single-stranded DNA was prepared from each colony according to the standard protocol, and was subjected to sequence analysis with DNA sequencers type 3700 and 3730 (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the Dye-terminator Cycle Sequencing kit according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The sequence data can be retrieved from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank public DNA Database under the accession numbers DE244757–DE246660.2.6. EST collectionExpressed sequence tags (ESTs) were collected from a variety ‘Hokuseki’ and a plant R130. cDNA libraries were constructed from 3-week-old plantlets of ‘Hokuseki’ and leaves of R130. Total RNA was extracted from 5 g of tissue by the guanidium thiocyanate/CsCl ultracentrifugation method, as described previously.22 Purification of polyadenylated RNA and conversion to cDNA was performed as described previously.22 Synthesized cDNA was resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and a fraction ranging from 1 to 3 kb was recovered. The recovered fragments were cloned into the EcoRI–XhoI sites of a pBluescript II SK-plasmid vector (Stratagene, USA) and introduced into an E. coli ElectroTen-Blue strain (Stratagene, USA) by electroporation. Normalization of the libraries was performed by self-hybridization, as previously described.22 For generation of ESTs, plasmid DNAs were prepared from the colonies and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The reaction mixtures were run on the automated DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 3730 (Applied Biosystems), and the collected data were processed as described below.2.7. Sequence data analysisRaw sequence data were quality-evaluated by the Phred program23,24 prior to data analyses. BLAST programs were used to search public DNA databases, a proteome database of A. thaliana and datasets of the TIGR gene indices of three legumes, M. truncatula, Glycine max and L. japonicus. For DNA regions adjacent to SSRs, a cut-off value of E ≤ 10−5 or bit scores ≥30 against the predicted genes of A. thaliana and L. japonicus or bit scores ≥30 against sequences in the TIGR gene indices were considered significant.EST data were analyzed as follows. Chromatograms were evaluated with Phred23,24 and vector-derived sequences were trimmed with Crossmatch (P. Green, Author Webpage).24 The EST reads were quality-trimmed by the Phred quality score at a position where 5 ambiguous bases (Phred score under16) were found within 15 contiguous bases. Reads that comprised >50 bp of contiguous satisfying quality were submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases with the accession numbers BB902456–BB928811. A similarity search against the UniProt Non-redundant Reference 100 (UniRef100) Databases (Author Webpage) was performed for each EST using the BLASTX program after translation into their respective amino acid sequences in six frames. EST sequences were clustered into non-overlapping groups by BLASTN using a criterion of 95% identity for >50 bases.2.8. Identification of SSRsFour types of genomic and cDNA libraries were constructed for identification of SSRs in the red clover genome.An SSR-enriched genomic library was constructed from HR and R130. The total cellular DNA was extracted from leaves of each plant using the DNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen, The Netherlands). The isolated DNA was mixed and fragmented by sonication followed by size fractionation by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments of length ranging from 800 to 1000 bp were cloned into an EcoRV site of the pBluescriptII SK-plasmid vector (Stratagene, USA) and introduced into E. coli ElectroTen-Blue (Stratagene, USA) by electroporation. Enrichment of SSR sequences in the genomic library was performed by a method modified from a previous report.25 Biotinylated oligos, 100 pmol each of (AAC)8, (AAG)8, (ATC)8, (GGA)8 and (GGT)8, were bound to Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Norway). Plasmid DNAs were prepared from the genomic library and the inserts were PCR-amplified using the vector-derived primers 5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCC-3′ (A) and 5′-TCGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGC-3′ (B). Predominantly single-stranded copies of the inserts were obtained by asymmetric PCR using a 1 : 10 ratio (0.5 and 5 pmol) of the A and B primers. Hybridization of biotinylated oligos and insert fragments was performed twice. After the second round of hybridization, the eluted supernatant was PCR-amplified using a equal amounts of vector-derived primers (5 pmol each). The PCR product was TA-cloned into pT7 Blue T-Vector (Novagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.A cDNA library was made from seedlings of ‘Hokuseki’ for generation of an SSR-enriched cDNA library. Extraction of total RNA and polyadenylated RNA and conversion to cDNA were carried out as described in Section 2.6. cDNA fragments ranging from 0.5 to 1 kb were cloned into pBluescript II SK-. Biotinylated oligos, 100 pmol each of (AAC)8, (AAG)8, (ATC)8, (GGA)8, (GGT)8, (CT)12, and (AAAG)6, were used as the driver. Hybridization of the biotinylated driver and PCR-amplified cDNA inserts and subsequent washing and cloning were performed as described above.Construction of a methyl-filtration genomic library was performed by cloning the sonicated genomic DNA segments of ∼1 kb length into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK-, followed by introduction into three mcrBC+ E. coli hosts, JM109, DH5α and XLI-Blue.26A normalized cDNA library was prepared from leaves and leafstalks of HR and leaves of R130 plants, as described above. The plasmid DNA was amplified directly from each colony for sequencing using the TempliPhi DNA amplification kit (Amersham, UK). Sequence analysis was performed from one end of each insert and the SSR motifs used for the enrichment process described above were searched. Only repeats equal to or longer than 15 bp were used for the subsequent steps.2.9. Amplification of SSR-containing regions and detection of polymorphismsPrimer pairs for amplification of SSR-containing regions were designed based on the flanking sequences of each SSR with the assistance of the Primer 3 program27 so that amplified fragment sizes were between 90 and 300 bp in length. PCR was performed in a total volume of 5 µl containing 0.5 ng of red clover genomic DNA, 1 × PCR buffer (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan), 0.2 U TaKaRa Taq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), 0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.8 µM each of the primers. Reactions were run using a modified ‘touchdown PCR’ program:28 3 min at 94°C for the initial denaturation, 3 cycles of 30 s at 94°C and 30 s at 68°C, followed by 2 rounds of the same program in which the annealing and extension temperatures were decreased by 2° every 3 cycles, then 4 rounds of a 3-step program of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 62°C, 30 s at 72°C, followed by 3 rounds of the same program in which the annealing temperature was decreased by 2° every 3 cycles, with a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were resolved either on 3% MetaPhor agarose gels (BMA, USA) or on 10% acrylamide gels. The primer pairs giving a polymorphism among the parents of the mapping population, HR and R130, and 10 F1 progenies were selected and used for scoring a mapping population of 188 F1 plants.2.10. RFLP assaysTotal DNA was isolated from young leaves of red clover using the CTAB extraction method described by Doyle and Doyle.29 Approximately 3 µg of DNA were digested with each of the six restriction enzymes, BamHI, DraI, EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI and PstI. The restriction fragments were separated on 0.6% agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes according to standard procedures. Red clover cDNA probes which had been mapped on the previously generated RFLP map13 were labeled using the ECL direct-labeling system (Amersham, UK) and used as probes for Southern hybridization. The signals were detected by chemi-luminescence using an X-ray film.2.11. Linkage analysisSegregation data obtained from a mapping population of 188 F1 plants using microsatellite and RFLP markers were analyzed by a combination of a color map method30 and a JoinMap program version 3.0 (Author Webpage). To increase the efficiency and accuracy of the map calculation, the scored markers were roughly classified into seven linkage groups using the color map method prior to the JoinMap calculation. Segregation data were scored by ‘cp’ population type codes for the JoinMap analysis, which was followed by conversion into color codes showing marker types according to the color map procedure. The color-coded genotypes were displayed in a matrix for each parent and classified into seven groups representing individual chromosomes. Two data subsets of individual linkage groups from each single parent were recalculated independently by the grouping module of JoinMap with LOD = 5. Two parental data subsets were merged to one data subset using a join module of JoinMap. The marker order was calculated by a mapping module of JoinMap with the following parameters: Kosambi's mapping function, LOD ≥ 2.0, REC ≤ 0.35.2.12. Allele frequency of the markers of other red clover germplasms3. Results3.1. Cytological analysis of the red clover genomeThe nuclear DNA contents of two red clover plants, HR and R130, were calculated to be 0.91 pg/2C (n = 7) and 0.89 pg/2C (n = 7), respectively, by comparison with an A. thaliana standard (0.32 pg/2C)31 (data not shown). These figures differ somewhat from a previous report (0.97 pg/2C) by Arumuganathan and Earle 7, in which chicken red blood cells (2.33 pg/2C) were used as a standard. Given that 1 pg of DNA is equivalent to 980 Mb,32,33 the genome sizes of HR and R130 are estimated to be 446 and 436 Mb, respectively.A karyotype of the red clover genome was analyzed by microscopic observation of prometaphase chromosomes stained by DAPI (Fig. 1a). The lengths of the prometaphase chromosomes ranged from 5.1 to 7.4 µm, and uneven condensation patterns that have proven useful in chromosome identification were observed. The resolution of individual chromosomes was better than a previous report34, in which the length of condensed metaphase chromosomes ranged from 1.9 to 2.9 µm, but seven chromosomes could not be definitively distinguished.Cytological analysis of the red clover genome.

Green circles, loci of seven BACs corresponding to LG-specific markers; red boxes, 28S rDNA loci; orange circles, 5S rDNA loci.To further characterize individual chromosomes, FISH analysis was performed using 28S and 5S rDNA fragments as probes. As shown in Fig. 1b, the 28S rDNA (green signals) loci could be detected most intensely in the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) on the short arm of Chromosome 1 (arrows) and as a less intense signal in the internal regions on the short arm of Chromosome 6 (arrowheads). An additional signal was observed on one Chromosome 5 homologue in HR, but not in R130 (Fig. 1b). The 5S rDNA loci (red signals) could be detected proximal to the NOR signals on Chromosome 1 (open arrows), and in an additional two loci on the short arm of Chromosome 2 (open arrows). The results are summarized in Fig. 1d.3.2. Sequence features of the genomeTo explore the general sequence features of the red clover genome, 960 plasmid clones from a random genomic library of HR were sequenced from both ends of the inserts, and 1920 sequence files with an average length of 732 bp and a Phred score of ≥20 totaling 1.4 Mb in length were generated. A total of 244 (12.7%) and 14 (0.7%) sequences showed a high degree of similarity (E ≤ 10−50) to the genomes of chloroplast and mitochondria of A. thaliana, respectively, indicating that these sequences are derived from these organelles. Ninety-three files (4.8%) matched higher plant rDNA sequences. The average GC content of the putative chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences were 33.8 and 42.9%, respectively, while that of the remaining sequence files, which are likely to originate from the nuclear genome, was 34.2%.Di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide motifs were extracted from the genomic sequences to assess the composition of SSRs in the red clover genome. A pattern search for SSRs of 15 nt or longer identified 126 such SSRs in the 1.2 Mb nuclear genomic sequences (one SSR in every 9.7 kb). The poly(AT)n (37 loci, 29% of the identified SSRs) was the most abundant motif, followed by poly(AAT)n (35 loci, 28%) and poly(GA)n (12 loci, 10%).The proportion of gene spaces in the entire genome was roughly estimated by determining the protein-coding regions in the genomic sequences. The sequence files (1662) that were likely to have originated from the nuclear genome were used as a query to search the proteome of A. thaliana and the sequences of M. truncatula, G. max and L. japonicus available in the TIGR gene indices (Author Webpage), with a minimum cut-off value of E = 10−5. As a result, 1018 out of 1662 files showed significant similarity to sequences of protein-coding genes in the dataset examined, and of these 177 files (10.6%) showed sequence similarity to genes related to transposons. The total length of the sequence files containing putative protein-coding regions but not transposons was 518 kb and their proportion in the files of the entire nuclear sequences was 50.6%.3.3. Gene featuresA total of 33 024 clones from cDNA libraries were single-pass sequenced from their 5′ ends and 26 356 ESTs which met the criteria described in Section 2 were obtained (Table 1). The quality of the libraries with respect to 5′-termini coverage was assessed by comparison of 5′-end sequences to known protein sequences. Among the randomly selected 100 clones, 50 contained a translation initiation codon. To determine the number of non-redundant ESTs, EST clustering was performed as described in Section 2, and the 26 356 sequences were classified into 9339 non-redundant groups comprising 3508 contig sequences and 5831 singletons.List of cDNA libraries constructed for EST analysis.List of cDNA libraries constructed for EST analysis.The 9339 non-redundant sequences were searched against the UniRef100 database to assign putative functions. At the time of writing, 7264 (78%) showed significant similarity (E < 10−10) to registered sequences. Most of the clones (4279) showed the highest similarity to A. thaliana genes; 670 were most similar to rice genes. Genes conserved between red clover and A. thaliana were classified into functional categories according to the Arabidopsis Gene Ontology (GO), provided by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (Author Webpage). The 7941 red clover genes showing similarity to A. thaliana genes (E < 10−5) were subjected to this analysis. The distribution of genes in the molecular function, biological process and cellular component categories are shown in Appendix Fig. 1. As for legume species, 251, 224, 100, 61 and 52 red clover genes were similar to genes in Pisum sativum, G. max, M. sativa, M. truncatula and L. japonicus, respectively. The EST sequence of each clone and similarity search results are provided at Author Webpage.3.4. Development of microsatellite markersTo identify SSRs in the red clover genome, we generated four different types of libraries, SSR-enriched genomic and cDNA libraries, a methyl-filtration genomic library and a normalized cDNA library, as shown in Table 2. The preliminary analysis of the cDNA sequences of M. truncatula and G. max in the TIGR gene indices, genomic and cDNA sequences of L. japonicus and cDNA sequences of red clover revealed that specific SSR motifs frequently occur in the protein-coding sequences of the legume genomes (data not shown). These motifs were used for selective enrichment in the construction of the SSR-enriched genomic and cDNA libraries, as described in Section 2. It has been reported that low-copy number gene-containing regions of the genome can be enriched by methyl filtration.26 We adopted this methodology to concentrate SSRs occurring in gene spaces in the red clover genome. A standard normalized cDNA library was also used as a source to isolate SSRs directly associated with expressed gene sequences.List of libraries for identification of SSRs.List of libraries for identification of SSRs.A total of 83 172 clones were isolated from the four libraries and subjected to sequence analysis. As summarized in Table 3, 15 427 (53%) and 6568 (57%) clones from the SSR-enriched genomic and cDNA libraries, respectively, contained SSRs of 15 nt or longer, while 533 (28%) and 6801 (25%) clones in the methyl-filtration genomic and the normalized cDNA libraries, respectively, contained such SSRs. Based on the nucleotide sequences obtained, we designed a total of 7244 primer pairs to amplify SSRs by PCR, with putative amplified products ranging from 90 to 300 bp in length. We performed similarity searches of unique sequences adjacent to each SSR against the sequences of the predicted genes of A. thaliana and L. japonicus as well as cDNA sequences in the TIGR gene indices. Cut-off values of E ≤ 10−5 or bit scores ≥30 were adopted according to the preliminary alignments examined by eye. As shown in Table 2, 5970 (82%) out of 7244 query sequences showed similarity to the protein-coding genes described above, indicating that a significant fraction of the SSRs identified in this study are associated with genespaces.Description of the integrated linkage map.aThe number in the parentheses shows the ratio (%) to total number of locus.bAverage distance between two loci.cA Significant at P > 0.05.Description of the integrated linkage map.aThe number in the parentheses shows the ratio (%) to total number of locus.bAverage distance between two loci.cA Significant at P > 0.05.Polymorphism was examined for the 7159 primer pairs using the mapping parent plants, HR and R130, and 10 F1 progeny as templates. Some of the SSRs found in the random genomic sequences and cDNA sequences used in the RFLP map construction were also tested. As a result, a total of 1488 primer pairs identified polymorphisms among the 12 plants on 3% agarose gels. The primer pairs producing multiple bands likely to have originated from multiple loci of the genome were excluded as much as possible to avoid confusion in map construction. The selected primer pairs were then used to score polymorphisms in 188 F1 plants of the mapping population. Ultimately, from a total of 1305 primer pairs, 1024 gave clear polymorphisms on 3% agarose gels and 281 on 10% acrylamide gels and these were used for construction of a linkage map.3.5. Screening of RFLP markersTo integrate the previous genetic linkage map generated with RFLP markers13 into the new map, 121 cDNA probes were examined for detection of RFLP among the HR and R130 mapping parent plants and 14 F1 progeny. Using 188 F1 plants from the mapping population, 95 probes that showed polymorphisms were used for further RFLP analysis. Of the 95 probes 37 produced 2–6 polymorphic bands. In these cases, each band was separately scored. In total, 167 RFLP markers were successfully scored for subsequent construction of the linkage map in combination with the microsatellite markers.3.6. Construction of a genetic linkage mapLinkage analysis using 1472 informative markers (1305 microsatellite and 167 RFLP markers) resulted in the assignment of 1463 loci to seven linkage groups by the color map procedure. Next, 1434 loci derived from 1399 markers (1286 detected by microsatellite markers and 148 by RFLP markers) were mapped onto the seven linkage groups by JoinMap. The results are summarized in Table 3, Appendix Fig. 2, Appendix Tables 1 and 2, and Supplemental Data at Author Webpage. The total map length was 868.7 cM with the shortest linkage group being 108.2 cM (LG6) and the longest being 149.7 cM (LG2). The average locus distance was 0.61 cM ranging from 0.46 cM in LG3 to 0.81 cM in LG5. Marker locus density seemed to be slightly higher in the proximal regions and lower in the distal regions of each linkage group (Appendix Fig. 2). A total of 34 markers (33 microsatellite and 1 RFLP) detected duplicate loci, of which 24 were bi-parental, 6 were HR-specific and 4 were R130-specific, and 17 of the duplicate loci mapped between linkage groups, 17 were within linkage groups.Bi-parental or parent-specific marker loci segregating from HR and R130 were distributed among the seven linkage groups. Out of 1434 loci 405 (28%) were bi-parental, while 611 (43%) and 418 (29%) were specific to HR and R130, respectively (Table 3). LG1 harbored HR-specific markers at the highest frequency (64% of all loci on LG1). Of 405 bi-parental loci, 167, 160 and 78 were <abxcd>, <efxeg>, and <hkxhk> segregation types, respectively (Table 4). Distorted segregation was observed for 27.1% of all the marker loci on the map (P < 0.05). The loci showing distortion were distributed among all the linkage groups (Table 3), but the proportion of distorted loci was different for each linkage group. Only 7.7% of the marker loci on LG5 exhibited segregation distortion, while 52.3% showed distortion in LG2. The distortion ratio was fairly similar among segregation types (22.7–31.9%), except for the <hkxhk> type (67.9%), as shown in Table 4.Number of locus and distortion ratio at each segregation type.aThe number in the parentheses shows the ratio (%) to total number of locus.Number of locus and distortion ratio at each segregation type.aThe number in the parentheses shows the ratio (%) to total number of locus.3.7. Linkage between genetic and cytological mapsTo confirm the authenticity of the genetic linkage map constructed above, each linkage group was assigned to a chromosome by FISH analysis. Seven microsatellite markers located close to the end of each linkage group were selected as representatives: RCS1777 (LG1), RCS1588 (LG2), RCS1627 (LG3), RCS1647 (LG4), RCS0036 (LG5), RCS0019 (LG6), RCS2546 (LG7) and the 3-D DNA pools of the BAC genomic libraries were screened by PCR using the corresponding primer pairs. The selected BAC clones were used as probes in FISH analysis for chromosome mapping. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the BAC clones harboring the markers RCS1777, RCS1588, RCS1627, RCS0036, RCS0019 and RCS2546 exclusively hybridized to the distal regions of Chromosome 4, 2, 5, 1, 6 and 3, respectively. RCS1647 was detected in the distal portion of Chromosome 7 and the central portion of Chromosome 1 adjacent to the NOR.3.8. Evaluation of allele frequency in germplasms by polymorphism analysisTo analyze transferability of the generated markers to other red clover germplasms, 268 randomly selected microsatellite markers were examined by PCR in 88 red clover individuals. The list of markers and the results are summarized in Appendix Table 3. All the tested markers produced amplification products (data not shown). Homozygous null alleles, where no bands were produced, were observed in at least 1 individual in 78 of the 268 markers tested. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 19 with a mean value of 6.5 (Fig. 2a). Markers detecting four alleles were most frequent. PIC values ranged from 0.05 to 0.89 with a mean value of 0.60 (Fig. 2b). Markers with PIC values between 0.7 and 0.8 were most common.Allele frequency in germplasms.

Sequences with E ≤ 10−5 were considered similar. Of the 1286 sequences that corresponded to mapped microsatellite markers, 434 and 566 showed sequence similarities to the genomes of L. japonicus and M. truncatula, respectively, 257 of which were common to both genomes (Appendix Table 1). For 133 and 161 red clover sequences a single match was found to the genomes of L. japonicus and M. truncatula, respectively, but the remaining 301 and 405 sequences had multiple matches to the respective genomes (Appendix Table 1 and Supplemental Data at Author Webpage). Two or more neighboring marker sequences of 52 loci on the red clover genetic linkage map had hits to either a single clone or clones closely located in the genomes of L. japonicus and M. truncatula (data not shown), suggesting the presence of microsynteny between red clover and the two model legumes.Because significant portions of the genomic sequences of L. japonicus and M. truncatula have been anchored on their respective genetic linkage maps, the syntenic relationship between the red clover and model legume genomes could be explored by simply comparing the map locations of the red clover DNA markers and the corresponding best-hit genomic sequences of the model legumes. As shown in Fig. 3, alignment of homologous sequence pairs along each linkage group revealed an obvious syntenic relationship. The alignment appears relatively simple in the case of the red clover (rc) LG1, L. japonicus (Lj) chr5 and M. truncatula (Mt) chr1. Lj chr1, on the other hand, appeared to correspond to two alignments, rc LG6–Mt chr7 and rc LG7–Mt chr3. In contrast, the relationship of other linkage groups of red clover with those of the two model legumes seemed to be more complex at the macro level. At the segmental level, however, syntenic relationships could be detected in all the linkage groups. Some of the linkages, such as rc LG 2–Lj chr2–Mt chr6 and rc LG 3–Lj chr4–Mt chr4, have been supported by the synteny analysis based on the genomic sequences of L. japonicus and M. truncatula.1Macrosynteny between the genomes of red clover and two model legumes. Putative syntenic relations were estimated by ordering the red clover DNA markers along with the linkage map positions of the corresponding best-hit genomic clones of L. japonicus and M. truncatula. In cases where multiple red clover LGs were assigned in a region of the L. japonicus and M. truncatula linkage maps, a representative red clover LG was selected for every 10 cM interval. For each represented syntenic region one or two representative pairs were drawn with the color code indicating the number of assigned homologous sequence pairs represented by colored lines, blue: one; green: two to four; red: five or more.Macrosynteny between the genomes of red clover and two model legumes.

DiscussionThe nuclear DNA contents of two red clover plants, HR and R130, were estimated to be 0.91 and 0.89 pg/2C, respectively, by flow cytometory using A. thaliana (0.32 pg/2C) as a standard. This result is not in close agreement with a previous report by Arumuganathan and Earle, which estimated the red clover DNA content to be 0.97 pg/2C and which used chicken red blood cells as a standard.7 The discrepancy between these studies may be due to the use of different standards and/or the heterogeneous genome structure of red clover due to its cross-pollination breeding system. Using the conversion factor of 1 pg DNA/980 Mb,32,33 the genome sizes of HR and R130 were estimated to be 446 and 436 Mb, respectively. In comparison, the nuclear DNA content and the corresponding genome size of rice were estimated to be 0.88–0.89 pg/2C and 435 Mb, respectively, under the same conditions (data not shown). However, this is an overestimation because the genome size of rice was shown to be 389 Mb by genome sequencing.35 Therefore, it is likely that the genome size of red clover is smaller than our present estimation, possibly as small as that of rice. The genome size of HR was slightly but consistently larger than that of R130. Whether this reflects a difference in genome structure or variability within the error range of our measurements remains to be clarified.We could not uniquely identify the seven chromosomes by DAPI staining because the banding patterns of the smaller chromosomes were not clear and some of the chromosomes were similar in size.34 However, FISH analysis using 28S and 5S rDNA as landmarks discriminated four of the chromosomes. Moreover, the presence of minor loci for 28S rDNA in addition to the NOR is a novel finding. One of the Chromosome 5 homologues in HR hybridized with 28S rDNA, but no Chromosome 5 staining was detected in R130. This may reflect a difference in genome structure between the two haplotypes in the HR genome.By random sequencing of the total cellular DNA, the GC content of three genomes in red clover was deduced as follows: chloroplast, 33.8%, mitochondrion, 42.9% and nucleus, 34.2%. The GC content of the nuclear genome was similar to those of two model legumes, L japonicus (37.0%) and M. truncatula (33.3%), as well as that of A. thaliana (34.8%). SSRs seemed to be distributed rather evenly throughout the genome. AT and AAT were the major motifs and comprised over 57% of all the di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide motifs, whereas AT, AG and AAG were dominant in L. japonicus and M. truncatula (data not shown). With respect to each repeat motif, 35% of the AT and 37% of the AAT motifs were linked to protein-coding sequences (data not shown). In contrast, 100% of ATC and 71% of AC motifs were associated with coding sequences, although these represent only 3.2 and 5.6%, respectively, of all the SSR motifs examined (data not shown).A similarity search against the registered sequences of plant genes indicated that approximately half of the red clover genomic sequences contained protein-coding genes. Considering that 78% of the red clover ESTs showed significant similarity to registered sequences, the genespace of red clover could be as much as 65% of the entire genome, while the remaining regions are likely to be occupied by known and unknown transposon-related and other repeat sequences. No highly repetitive sequences were detected in this analysis.We generated 26223 red clover ESTs that were grouped into 9339 non-redundant species. At the time of writing, the EST database in GenBank (dbEST) contained only 53 ESTs from a clover, Trifolium purpureum. Undoubtedly, the EST information as well as the cDNA clones generated in this study will facilitate gene isolation and large-scale analysis of gene function in Trifolium species. A similarity search against the UniRef100 protein database found that ∼80% of the ESTs showed significant similarity to the registered genes, indicating that the functions of the majority of genes obtained in this EST project can be deduced by similarity to known genes. The result of GO classification of the red clover ESTs indicated that the cDNA clones were rather evenly distributed among a variety of functional classes, suggesting that we obtained a representative selection of gene species, probably by normalization of the cDNA library. To encourage the use of these data by the research community, we have created a database to provide EST sequence information for each clone and primary annotations deduced by similarity to known protein sequences (Author Webpage).In this study, we aimed to develop a genetic linkage map of the red clover genome with a sufficient number of gene-associated microsatellite markers to facilitate map-based gene cloning and precise mapping of quantitative trait loci genes. We intended to adopt a cost-effective system to make use of the generated markers for a wide variety of purposes including breeding. For identification of SSRs, we constructed four different libraries: SSR-enriched genomic and cDNA libraries, a methyl-filtrated genomic library and a normalized cDNA library. SSRs were found in 53 and 57% of the clones from the SSR-enriched genomic and cDNA libraries, respectively, indicating that enrichment of SSRs by hybridization was successful. It should be noted that even the methyl-filtrated genomic library and the normalized cDNA library that were generated without any SSR enrichment process contained substantial amounts of SSRs.DNA markers associated with genes are more informative and useful than those randomly generated from genomes such as genomic microsatellite, RAPD and AFLP markers. A similarity search against the predicted gene sequences of A. thaliana and L. japonicus and the cDNA sequences in the TIGR gene indices was performed to evaluate the libraries derived from red clover genomic DNA. Methyl filtration proved to be effective in enrichment of gene sequences because >90% of the clones from the methyl-filtrated genomic library showed similarity to presumptive genes. Of the SSRs identified in the SSR-enriched genomic library 60% were likely to originate from genespaces partly because hybridization was performed for SSRs preferentially located in the protein-coding sequences. Together with the SSRs from the two types of cDNA libraries, >80% of the SSRs identified in this study were likely to be originated from the genespace regions, demonstrating that the SSRs isolated in this study are an excellent source for the generation of gene-associated microsatellite markers.Out of 7159 primer pairs we selected 1488 (21%) to amplify SSRs based on detection of polymorphisms in a mapping population on 3% agarose gels. In fact, ∼70% of the microsatellite markers corresponding to the selected 1488 primer pairs could be genotyped fairly clearly on agarose gels with the 188 F1 mapping population. This screening ratio (21%) is much lower than that in white clover (63%), where polymorphisms were detected by capillary electrophoresis arrays.14 We adopted the agarose gel system instead of more cost-intensive but sensitive systems, such as a fluorescent capillary gel system, to meet the requirements of a wide variety of users including breeders. This decision affected the success rate of selection of polymorphic markers. However, the primer pairs were screened under stringent conditions, thus allowing stable amplification and polymorphism detection in other detection systems. Sequence analysis of the amplified products showed that SSRs were indicative of polymorphism for most of the bands ranging from 200 to 500 bp in length, while polymorphisms observed in bands longer than 500 bp were often allocated to non-SSR regions (data not shown).We constructed a genetic linkage map of 868.7 cM composed of 1434 marker loci, most of which were detected by microsatellite markers. Recently, high-density genetic linkage maps have been reported in several plant species: a rice map with 2740 microsatellite loci (157 kb/locus) by electronic-PCR,36 a sorghum map of 1713 cM with 2926 loci mostly detected by AFLP markers37 and a integrated soybean map of 2524 cM with 1849 loci mostly detected by microsatellite markers.38 The red clover linkage map in the present study is comparable to these maps in terms of locus density and marker quality (co-dominant and gene association). Furthermore, only 2.3% of the markers detected duplicate loci, a phenomenon which often leads to confusion in map construction. These data also demonstrate high level of transferability of our markers and the map to other red clover germplasms and other plant species.The total length of the genetic linkage map generated in this study was 868.7 cM, which is substantially longer than that of the previous RFLP map (535.3 cM),13 indicating that a larger number of marker loci extended coverage of the genome. An alternative explanation is that the lengths of linkage maps are variable depending on inherent differences in mapping populations.2 The parents of the present map originated in Switzerland and Japan (HR) and Russia (R130), while those of the previous map were derived only from Russia. The proportion of HR-specific loci (43%) was significantly larger than R130-specific (29%) and bi-parental (28%) loci, indicating that genetic diversity between two the haplotypes in HR was wider than that in R130.We observed large spaces between marker loci at many of the distal portions of the linkage groups. The causes of this uneven distribution of loci remain to be studied. Since the majority of markers generated in this study are likely to be gene-associated, it is possible that the lower density reflects a lower gene density due to the presence of repetitive sequences in the distal regions of the chromosomes. Another possibility would be that the markers were mapped on these regions simply by type I error in the linkage analysis. Nevertheless, the FISH analysis for the markers in the distal regions of each linkage group, especially RCS0019, mapped at the terminus of LG6, which demonstrates the authenticity of the genetic linkage map generated in this study.The relative ratio of the physical length to the genetic distance can be roughly estimated to be 507 kb/cM by simply dividing the genome size (440.1 Mb) by the length of the linkage map. The relative physical/genetic distance is shorter in red clover than in other legumes: 970 kb/cM in M. truncatula,2 907 kb/cM in L. japonicus39 and 835 kb/cM in white clover14. The genome size of red clover is comparable to those of M. truncatula and L. japonicus. Generally, genome diversity is wider in allogamous plants than in autogamous plants, and this might influence genetic segregation, resulting in different relative ratios of the physical to genetic distance. Alternatively, the difference in physical/genetic distance between two allogamous plants, red clover and white clover, may simply reflect the difference in genome size, 440.1 Mb in red clover versus 956 Mb in white clover14.The density of the marker loci varies among the seven linkage groups. LG5 is a relatively short linkage group with a low density of loci. LG5 corresponds to Chromosome 1 harboring a large satellite which hybridizes with 28S rDNA. The long stretch of 28S rDNA, where genetic recombination is restricted, might result in the short genetic distance. The small number of marker loci, on the other hand, may reflect a lower gene density in this chromosome. Sequence conservation of rDNA and of other regions of Chromosome 1 may also contribute to the low degree of polymorphism and the short length of this linkage group. LG1 is an intermediate sized linkage group with the lowest density of loci. The distinctive feature of this linkage group is the highest proportion of HR-specific marker loci (64%). As described above, HR originated from varieties that were bred in two countries, Japan and Switzerland. These data suggest that LG1 was much more conserved within the red clover germplasms before they spread worldwide. Interestingly, a high degree of macrosynteny is observed between red clover LG1 and the genomes of two model legumes, M. truncatula and L. japonicus. Further analysis of LG1 with respect to synteny and gene function may provide clues to the evolution of red clover, as well as of other legume species.Approximately 27% of the marker loci exhibited segregation distortion in the present map, while 37% showed distortion in the previous RFLP map. A high degree of genomic diversity in the mapping population used in this study may have contributed to reduced levels of distortion. The distortion ratio was especially high (68%) in the <hkxhk> type, possibly because some mechanism to avoid inbreeding weakness affected segregation. Distortion ratios varied among the seven linkage groups, ranging from 8 to 52% (Table 3). LG2, the longest linkage group, showed the highest distortion ratio.The linkage between the genetic map and the cytological map was investigated by FISH analysis. The marker RCS1647 for LG4 hybridized to two different loci, the distal portion of Chromosome 7 and the central portion of Chromosome 1. The signal on Chromosome 1 might be due to duplication of a gene or a chromosomal segment during genome evolution. All the signals except that of RCS1647 on Chromosome 1 were detected at the distal portions of each chromosome, which agrees well with the positions of the respective markers on the corresponding linkage groups. This, together with the clear one-to-one relationship between each linkage group and each chromosome, strongly demonstrates the authenticity of the genetic linkage map.Breeding involves thousands of individuals with a wide variety of genetic variations, whereas genetic linkage maps generated using F1 mapping populations reflect only four haplotypes. Thus, in order to utilize DNA markers and linkage maps for breeding processes such as development of screening markers and diversity analysis, transferability of the markers is crucial. In this study, we confirmed transferability of 268 selected markers on the genetic linkage map to 88 red clover germplasms derived from 11 varieties. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 19 with a mean value of 6.5, which is greater than the number identified in the previous RFLP map (average 3.1 alleles per locus ranging from 1 to 10). This result strongly indicates that the microsatellite markers developed in this study are suitable tools for analyzing numerous red clover germplasms.PIC estimates the number of polymorphic pairs among all possible pairs in a population. In this study, the average PIC of 268 microsatellite markers was 0.6, which means that 60% of the germplasms (or two haplotypes) have heterozygous loci. For construction of a map using F1 progeny at least one of four haplotypes needs to show polymorphisms. To estimate the polymorphism ratio in four alleles PICi/4 allele=1−∑iPij4⁠, where Pij is the frequency of the jth allele for the ith marker, was calculated. The mean value of PICi/4 allele for the 268 microsatellite markers was 0.85 (data not shown), which means that the probability of detecting a polymorphism between a pair of mapping parents per marker is 85%. In this study, we observed distortions from the normal distribution of allele number per locus and PIC. The allele number per locus observed most frequently was 4, which is smaller than the mean value of 6.2. However, the PIC distribution peaked at 0.7–0.8, which is larger than the mean value of 0.6. Because PIC is determined by the number and deviation of alleles in each locus, these data suggest that the higher PIC value could be largely attributed to an even distribution of polymorphic alleles rather than the total number of alleles.Utilizing the sequence and map information obtained in this study, we compared the genome structures of red clover and two model legumes, L. japonicus and M. truncatula. A similarity search indicated that a substantial proportion of the red clover marker sequences showed sequence similarities to the model legumes, even though the sequences of only half of the entire genomes of each model species are currently publicly available. This demonstrates that genomes of red clover and the model legumes can be linked by the use of the DNA markers and the corresponding sequences. It is implicative that approximately two-thirds of the red clover markers examined have two or more matching sequences in the genomes of L. japonicus and M. truncatula. This may be due to gene and/or segmental genome duplications, which have diversified the genome structures during evolution. Nevertheless, a moderate degree of macrosynteny was observed between the genomes of red clover and the two model legumes as shown in Fig. 3, and the presence of microsynteny was also suggested.The genome information and resources that we generated for red clover in this study are not as abundant as those accumulated for A. thaliana and some major crop plants. However, even these resources are sufficient for multiple applications. For example, combination of the microsatellite markers with known gene sequences and the genomic BAC libraries, which provide a 7.9-fold coverage of the genome, would allow isolation of most of the genes homologous to those of agronomic importance. A combination of information and material resources of the genomes not only in red clover but also in other plant species would provide further possibilities, including identification and isolation of genes utilizing synteny information from the model plants, development of DNA markers for candidate genes based on sequences from other plants, generation of consensus genetic maps among intra- and inter-specific groups, evaluation of variation among genetic resources and an efficient association analysis.One of our major intentions in this study was to connect genomics to breeding. There is a large gap between plant genomics and breeding, even though breeding has been considered one of the most important and expected outcomes of genomics. Although various reasons for this discord could be hypothesized, financial and technical difficulties are among the leading issues. As one of the attempts to fill this gap, we insisted on a cost-effective and simple marker system which is user-friendly to breeders. We believe that PCR-based microsatellite markers, together with the detection system adopting agarose gels rather than acrylamide or capillary gels, would facilitate interchange of information and technologies between the two contrastive research fields. Breeding is often compared to an art because it pursues the creation of ‘ideal genotypes’ which have never existed. It is said that a great artistic work is born from a mixture of essential knowledge and sensibility. In this study, basic knowledge on the genome structure of red clover as well as material resources has been provided. We hope that these, mixed with the sensibility of the breeders, will contribute to the birth to fabulous new varieties in the near future.This work was supported by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation and NARCH, supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries with the cooperation of the Rice Genome Research Program.Classification of ESTs into functional categories according to Arabidopsis Gene Ontology.

It appears to be a rare phenomenon, as only seven examples of intergenic splicing have been well characterized in mammals. 1–7 Close proximity or a particular orientation of source genes are not thought to drive intergenic splicing; for example, in the case involving translin-associated factor X ( TRAX ) and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ( DISC1 ), the two genes are separated by 60 kb of genomic DNA. 4 It has been speculated that intergenic splicing might serve as an efficient mechanism for generating new multi-domain proteins and could therefore have major evolutionary implications. 3 Matrilins (MATNs) are a family of non-collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that consist at least of four related proteins, termed matrilin-1 through -4. All four are expressed in the developing skeletal system, showing varied patterns of tissue expression. 8 MATNs are composed of one or two von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domains, separated by a variable number of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, followed by the coiled-coil domain. 8–10 Matrilin-3 ( MATN3 ) expression is restricted to developing cartilage and is postulated to function in bridging protein–protein and cell–protein networks in the ECM. 8 , 9 Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane (LAPTM) family proteins reside in the lysosomal membrane and are thought to function as transporters or channels. There are three LAPTM genes comprising LAPTM4α ( LAPTM4A ), LAPTM4β ( LAPTM4B ) and LAPTM5 ( LAPTM5 ). The two LAPTM4 proteins have four predicted transmembrane domains, whereas LAPTM5 has five. 11–13 LAPTM4A is thought to regulate intracellular compartmentalization of amphipathic solutes and possibly mediates the cell's sensitivity to anthracyclines, antibiotics, ionophores, nucleobases and organic cations. 12 The MATN and LAPTM families are entirely different with regard to localization and putative function. While characterizing the transcription start site of MATN3 , however, we unexpectedly identified a novel intergenic splicing product that joined portions of the MATN3 and LAPTM4A transcripts. The hybrid transcript showed a specific expression pattern and sub-cellular localization that was different from the original genes and is further alternatively spliced. Alignments of the MATN and LAPTM family genes on the genome suggested that this composite structure may also be characteristic of other MATN and LAPTM family gene pairs. This speculation is confirmed for the MATN2 and LAPTM4B pair. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. RNA extraction and reverse transcriptionTotal RNAs were extracted using ISOGEN (NIPPON GENE, Tokyo, Japan) and were purified with RNeasy Mini Kit or RNeasy Lipo Tissue Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Exon connection PCR for the exon-connection experiment was performed using the Takara ExTaq system (Takara Shuzo, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 µl, using as templates several ng of cDNA. Primer sequences for amplification are (i) LAPTM4A–MATN3 : 5′-CAGTGACCGGTTCTACAGCA-3′ in exon 1 of LAPTM4A and 5′-GTGTAGGCCTGGAGTTGGAA-3′ in exon 2 of MATN3 , LAPTM4A–MATN3 nested PCR: 5′-ACCGGTTCTACAGCACCCGGT-3′ in exon 1 of LAPTM4A and 5′-GGCCTGGAGTTGGAACTCGATC-3′ in exon 2 of MATN3 , (ii) LAPTM4B–MATN2 : 5′-ACGCGGTTCTACTCCAACAG-3′ in exon 1 of LAPTM4B and 5′-TGTCCACGATGAACTCCTTG-3′ in exon 3 of MATN2 and (iii) LAPTM5–MATN1 : 5′-AGACCTGCTGCTGCTTCAAT-3′ in exon 1 of LAPTM5 and 5′-AGCGAGAACTCCTGCTTCAC-3′ in exon 2 of MATN1 , respectively. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (94°C, 2 min) followed by 20–40 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 s), annealing (55°C, 30 s), extension (72°C, 30 s) and final extension (72°C, 7 min). PCR products were electrophoresed on 2–3% agarose gels. 2.3. Expression analysis of the hybrid transcripts Expression of LAPTM4A , MATN3 and the LAPTM4A–MATN3 hybrid transcripts in various cell lines was examined using chondrogenic and non-chondrogenic cell lines. The chondrogenic cell lines included CS-OKB (gift from Dr Chano, Shiga University of Medical Science, Japan) and OUMS27 (IFO Animal Cell Bank); the non-chondrogenic cell lines included HuH7 (JCRB Cell Bank), HeLa (JCRB Cell Bank) and HEK293 (Clontech). The sources of the human cell lines were CS-OKB and OUMS27, chondrosarcoma; Huh7, hepatoma; HeLa, cervical cancer; and HEK293, embryonic kidney. Expression of the LAPTM4A–MATN3 hybrid transcripts in various tissues was examined using the BD MTC Panels (Human I and II, Clontech). 2.4. Cloning of the LAPTM4A–MATN3 fusion gene Full-length of the LAPTM4A–MATN3 cDNA was amplified by the Takara LA Taq system (Takara Shuzo) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a set of primers 5′-AAACAGCCGTTTGAGTTTGG-3′ in 5′-UTR of LAPTM4A and 5′-TCAGGTGAGAAATTGGAGCA-3′ in 3′-UTR of MATN3 . Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 µl, using as a template several nanograms of OUMS27 cDNA. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation (94°C, 2 min) followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 s), annealing (57°C, 30 s), extension (72°C, 90 s) and final extension (72°C, 7 min). The resulting PCR product was gel-purified and was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The obtained clones were confirmed by sequencing and were cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO using the pcDNA3.1 Directional TOPO expression Kit (Invitrogen). 2.5. Cellular localization of the hybrid transcripts For immunostaining with antibody to the V5 tag, HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO 2 in DMEM-high glucose supplemented with penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). OUMS27 cells were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO 2 in DMEM-high glucose supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours after plating in a 2-well glass slide at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/well, cells were transfected with 1 µg of a pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) containing full-length cDNA of the fusion gene, using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min and examined for immuno-fluorescence. The antibodies used for markers of intracellular organelles were as follows: for LAMP1 (a marker of lysosome), mouse anti-LAMP1 monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and goat anti-mouse IgG TEXAS RED (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); for Mannosidase II (a marker of Golgi), anti-rabbit Mannosidase II polyclonal IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probe, OR, USA); for PDI [a marker of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)], anti-rabbit PDI polyclonal IgG (Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probe). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 10% BSA in PBS to block non-specific binding of antibodies. Primary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA (1/100–200) and incubated with the fixed cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA (1/500) and incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS three times. Anti-V5-FITC (Fluorescein Isothiocyanate conjugated) antibody (Invitrogen) was used for immuno-fluorescence detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were examined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with TEXAS RED and FITC filters. For immunostaining with MATN3, OUMS27 cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min, 24 h after plating in 12-well plate at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/well. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 10% BSA in PBS to block non-specific binding of antibodies. The rabbit anti-MATN3 polyclonal antibody 14 , 15 (a gift from Dr Raimund Wagener) was diluted in 3% BSA and incubated with fixed cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS three times. The goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) was diluted in 3% BSA and incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS three times and examined using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a FITC filter. 3. Results3.1. Identification of a novel fusion transcript between LAPTM4A and MATN3 To examine the 5′ region of the human MATN3 gene, we obtained several clones extending the previous 5′ end using 5′ RACE with 3′ primers in exon 2 of MATN3 ( Fig. 1 ). Sequence analysis extended the longest clone 128 bp beyond the 5′ end of the MATN3 reference sequence (GenBank accession no. NM_002381 ), and subsequent BLAST analysis identified the extended sequence as exons 1 and 2 of the LAPTM4A gene (GenBank accession no. NM_014713 ). In this clone, exon 1 of MATN3 was skipped. Examination of genomic sequence (GenBank accession no. NT_015926 ) revealed that LAPTM4A is located ∼20 kb 5′ to MATN3 on the same strand ( Fig. 1 ), with no genes between the two. Exons 1 and 2 of LAPTM4A reside 45.4 and 34.7 kb apart from exon 2 of MATN3 , respectively.  We confirmed the presence of the novel transcript through an exon-connection experiment, amplifying the entire coding region of the fusion gene by RT–PCR, using primers that flank the 5′-UTR of LAPTM4A and the 3′-UTR of MATN3 . This experiment verified the identity of an intergenic splicing product consisting of exons 1 and 2 of LAPTM4A and exon 2 to the last exon (exon 8) of MATN3 . As the two open reading frames (ORFs) are fused in frame, translation of the hybrid mRNA, starting at the LAPTM4A initiation codon, are predicted to produce a LAPTM4A–MATN3 fusion protein containing the first transmembrane domain of LAPTM4A and all major domains of MATN3 ( Fig. 2 ).

Expression of MATN3, LAPTM4A and the hybrid transcript Expression of the LAPTM4A–MATN3 hybrid transcript in various tissues and cell lines was examined by RT–PCR. The hybrid transcript showed specific tissue expression restricted to placental ( Fig. 3A ), and expression was observed in HuH7 and OUMS27 cells ( Fig. 3B ). Expression of the hybrid transcript was not observed in cartilage and bone ( Fig. 3C ). We also compared the expression of the source genes, LAPTM4A and MATN3 , with that of the hybrid transcript ( Fig. 3 ). LAPTM4A was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cell lines examined. In contrast, MATN3 was expressed in a more limited fashion; it was expressed relatively strongly in the placenta, lung, kidney, pancreas, testis and ovary. Among the cell lines, MATN3 was expressed strongly in HuH7 and OUMS27 cells but weakly in HEK293 and HeLa cells. Thus, the expression patterns of the two source transcripts and the hybrid transcript differed greatly. In addition, we observed several different patterns of intergenic splicing products (hybrid transcripts B–D; Fig. 4 ).

Similar conserved genomic structures for the LAPTM and MATN family genes Other LAPTM and MATN family genes showed genomic co-localization patterns similar to that of LAPTM4A and MATN3 , with gene pairs aligning in head-to-tail orientation ( Figs 5 and 6 ). No LAPTM family gene co-localizes with MATN4 . Localization of LAPTM and MATN genes is preserved during evolution; in particular, co-localization of LAPTM4A and MATN3 is preserved among the mouse, rat, chicken and fugu genomes (ECR Browser: URL Author Webpage ).  Co-localization on the genome is similar to that of other LAPTM and MATN family gene pairs. Genomic structure of the LAPTM5 and MATN1 genes. The open boxes indicate coding regions.

Identification of hybrid transcripts in other pairs of LAPTM and MATN family genes We scanned for hybrid transcripts joining other pairs of LAPTM and MATN family genes using exon-connection experiments with primers specific for exon 1 of LAPTM genes and exon 2 or 3 of MATN genes. This analysis identified two LAPTM4B – MATN2 hybrid transcripts: the longer transcript skipped exon 7 (the last exon) of LAPTM4B , while the shorter transcript skipped exons 2–7 of LAPTM4B ( Fig. 6 ). The longer form was predicted to be translated to LAPTM4B lacking only the amino acid residues encoded by the last exon. The shorter form was also predicted to be containing a single LAPTM transmembrane region. In both forms, exon 1 of MATN2 was skipped and the MATN2 component began at −26 from the original translation start site of MATN2 in exon 2. Both forms had a stop codon in the original 5′-UTR of MATN 2 (−5 from the translation start site), which resulted in the total absence of the original MATN2 amino acid sequence and addition of unique seven amino acid residues to their C-terminals ( Fig. 6 ). The LAPTM4B – MATN2 hybrid transcripts that showed specific tissue expression: the longer form was found in HuH7; the shorter form was found in heart and HEK293 ( Fig. 7 ). No hybrid transcript between LAPTM5 and MATN1 was identified.  Expression of LAPTM4B and MATN2 hybrid transcripts in various tissues ( A ) and cell lines ( B ).

In both cells, the fusion protein was detected in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 8A, D and G ), and sub-cellular localization was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using a MATN3 antibody. 14 , 15 Double-staining with antibodies for markers of lysosome, Golgi and ER revealed that the fusion protein did not localize within those organelles ( Fig. 8 ).

Discussion Here, we have shown that transcripts of two previously characterized genes can join via intergenic splicing to create a single transcriptional unit. Intergenic splicing has been reported for seven mammalian genes; 1–7 however, this case is unusual in that most exons in the 5′ gene component ( LAPTM4 ) are skipped. In other instances, only the final exon in the 5′ gene is skipped, with the exception of the TRAX – DISC1 hybrid, which omits the last two exons. 4 The genomic distances between the source gene pairs characterized here are the second and third greatest among known examples.  This is the first example of intergenic splicing between two pairs of genes that belong to the same families. We were unable to identify a fusion transcript joining a third pair, MATN1 and LAPTM5 , using RT–PCR. Such a fusion may elude identification if its hybridization pattern differs from that of other pairs or if hybrid transcripts are alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific or cell type-specific manner. Hybridization of transcripts between multiple pairs of family genes suggests that intergenic splicing is more common than previously thought and that similar scenarios might exist among other gene families. Our observation illustrates the fundamental challenges in defining the gene, or the transcriptional unit. In the most recent version of the published human genome sequence (NCBI Human Build 35.1), the gene pairs MATN3 – LAPTM4A and LAPTM4B – MATN2 are classified as distinct genes. If intergenic splicing is more common than we presently know, then the current estimate of gene number in the human genome 16 might be too high.  The role and function of intergenic splicing remain unclear. Combining various modular structures from distinct genes can increase the complexity of protein products, as seen with immunoglobulins. The biological and/or physiological significance of the additional minor transcripts is also unclear, although they could further increase complexity and the number of protein products generated from a set of genes. Alternatively, the fusion genes may have functional roles beyond creating genetic diversity. The specific expression of the MATN – LAPTM hybrid transcripts suggests that this is a regulated phenomenon with a precise function. For comparison, a putative functional link exists between the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligands TWEAK ( TNFSF12 ) and APRIL ( TNFSF13 ) and the fusion protein they create. TWEAK encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on the cell surface, and APRIL encodes a secreted factor. 7 The TWEAK–APRIL fusion localizes to the cell membrane and presents the receptor-binding domain of APRIL on the cell surface. 7 It is also possible that the products of intergenic splicing might influence expression of the source genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion via transcriptional interference.  Although the function of the LAPTM4A–MATN3 fusion protein is unclear, its cellular and tissue expression patterns as well as its sub-cellular localization differ from those of the original source genes, suggesting a unique and specific role. Tandemly arranged tyrosine-containing motifs in the C-terminal domain are necessary and sufficient for localization of LAPTM4A to the lysosome. 12 These motifs, along with the signal peptide of MATN3, are absent from the fusion protein, likely altering its sub-cellular localization. MATN3 contains a single N-terminal vWFA domain followed by four EGF repeats and the coiled-coil domains. 8 These functional domains are retained in the fusion gene, while most of the putative domains of LATMP4A are deleted. It is therefore likely that most of the biochemical, and hence biological, activities of MATN3 would be preserved in the fusion protein. In other proteins, the vWFA domain functions as a collagen-binding domain. 17 MATN1 binds to type II collagen fibrils and interacts with aggrecan and integrin α 1 β 1 . 18 Thus, MATN could link the collagen fibril network with the proteoglycan network and serve as a connection to chondrocytes. 19 EGF-like domains are commonly found in ECM proteins, and when arranged in tandem they give rise to flexible rods, as seen in laminin. 8 , 20 Coiled-coil domains mediate covalent multimer formation among the MATNs. 18 However, because the fusion protein localizes to the cytoplasm, its association with these ECM proteins is unlikely. Further studies are necessary to determine the function of the fusion gene.

Introduction In mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked gene products between XY males and XX females is achieved by transcriptional inactivation of one X chromosome in females. 1 The Xist gene is expressed exclusively from the inactive X (Xi), and seems to trigger initiation of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in cis . 2 It transcribes a 17.8 kb nuclear mRNA which is not translated. 3 In the early mouse embryo, low levels of Xist expression are detected from the single X and from both the Xs in the male and female embryo, respectively. 4 , 5 In female embryos, immediately prior to gastrulation, up-regulation of Xist RNA occurs on the one X chromosome to be inactivated. 4 Repression of Xist/XIST on the active X (Xa) in males and females has been correlated with methylation of its 5′ end. 6 , 7 This region is hypermethylated on the Xa, where Xist/XIST is repressed, and hypomethylated on the Xi, where Xist/XIST is expressed. These results suggest that methylation is involved in Xist/XIST gene silencing in humans 7 , 8 and mice. 9 , 10 Indeed, treatment of normal human fibroblasts and somatic cell hybrids containing one human Xa with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) leads to XIST demethylation and expression. 11 , 12 To date, five different mammalian DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (MTases) have been identified: Dnmt1, Dnmt2, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3L. 13–16 Dnmt1 is constitutively expressed, has higher activity in hemi-methylated DNA and has been recognized as a major maintenance MTase (reviewed in Bestor 17 ). Dnmt2 was isolated based on its homology to the pmt1p of fission yeast, and is expressed at low levels in all human and murine tissues. 14 Although neither de novo nor maintenance DNA MTase activity has been demonstrated for this protein in murine ES cells, 18 low in vitro activity of human DNMT2 was detected and it was specific for a loose DNA consensus sequence. 19 In contrast, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have been shown to be essential for de novo DNA MTase activity in murine ES cells and in early embryos, but not required for the maintenance of imprinted methylation patterns. 20 More recently, Dnmt3a was shown to be required for methylation of imprinted loci in germ cells. 21 In humans, mutations in DNMT3B cause ICF syndrome, characterized by the hypomethylation of pericentromeric repetitive DNA. 22 , 23 Finally, Dnmt3L was isolated based on its homology to Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the cysteine-rich region. 16 Like Dnmt3a, this protein is required for the establishment of genomic imprints during gametogenesis. 24 However, Dnmt3L lacks the catalytic domain common in the other MTases and it represses transcription by binding to the histone deacetylase HDAC1 protein rather than by methylating DNA. 25 , 26 The role of Dnmt1 in the process of DNA methylation and XCI has been extensively studied in mice. Murine ES cells deficient for Dnmt1 show high levels of global DNA demethylation, which in turn leads to biallelic expression of imprinted genes. 27 , 28 In addition, upon differentiation, these cells fail to repress Xist expression, a phenomenon correlated to lack of proper methylation of the 5′ region of the Xist gene. 6 These results demonstrate that Dnmt1 activity is causally involved in global DNA methylation and in transcriptional repression of imprinted genes and of the Xist gene. 5 , 6 The role of the human homologue DNMT1 in controlling gene expression was investigated in the human carcinoma cell line HCT116 knockout for the DNMT1 gene by homologous recombination. 29 Surprisingly, the authors showed that despite a greatly decreased DNMT1 activity the cells presented only a 20% reduction in overall DNA methylation, restricted to specific regions of the genome. Using the same approach, Rhee et al. 30 generated HCT116 cell lines deficient for DNMT3B and for both DNMT1 and DNMT3B. While DNMT3B knockout cells retained >97% of genomic 5-methylcytosine (m 5 C), the double knockout (DKO) cells presented ∼95% reduction in the m 5 C content. This in turn leads to transcriptional activation of TIMP-3 , the imprinted IGF2 allele and the wild-type  p16 INK4a allele. The authors thus concluded that DNMT1 and DNMT3B cooperate to maintain global DNA methylation and gene silencing in those human cancer cells.  These data indicate that human MTases may be involved in DNA methylation differently than their murine counterparts. That prompted us to investigate the methylation status of XIST in the absence of DNMT1 and DNMT3B activity in the HCT116 knockout cells. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell culture Parental HCT116 cell line, two independent DNMT1 knockout clones (1C1 and 9A), one DNMT3B knockout clone (3bKO) and one DNMT1/DNMT3B DKO clone were kindly provided by Drs B. Vogelstein and K. Schuebel. 29 , 30 These cells contain one normal X and one normal Y chromosomes. Cells were cultured without selection in McCoy media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicilin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37°C/5% CO 2 . Treatment with 5-aza-dC (Sigma) was as follows: cells at the mid-log phase in 100 mm culture dishes were supplemented with fresh media containing 10 µM of 5-aza-dC. Fresh media with 5-aza-dC was added every 24 h for 48 h. Cells were allowed to recover from treatment for 48 h in media without the drug before harvesting. Treatment was carried out in duplicate plates. DKO cells were treated for up to 72 h with 30 µM 5-aza-dC. 2.2. Analysis of XIST gene expression RNA was isolated from treated and untreated pooled cells with the Trizol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Analysis of XIST gene expression was performed by northern blotting with 20 µg of total RNA as described previously 31 using a probe from the most 5′ XIST cDNA clone Hbc1a. 32 Normal female fibroblasts were used as a positive control for XIST expression and G3PDH cDNA probe as an internal control. DNMT1 and DNMT3B gene activity were evaluated by hybridization of northern blots with radiolabeled DNMT1 (data not shown) and DNMT3B cDNAs, respectively. Lack of DNMT1 expression was confirmed by RT–PCR. 2.3. Analysis of XIST 5′ end methylation DNA was isolated from cells as described previously. 31 Analysis of methylation of the 5′ end of the XIST gene was performed by Southern blotting with the most 5′ XIST cDNA clone Hbc1a as the probe, as described previously. 7 , 12 An aliquot of 5–10 µg of genomic DNA was digested with 100 U each of EcoR V and one of the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes Hha I and Ava I, and with 100 U each of Pst I and the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme Sac II (Amersham-Pharmacia). 3. Results and Discussion3.1. Maintenance of XIST repression in the absence of DNMT1XIST gene activity was assayed by northern blot analysis of total RNA from the parental HCT116 cell line and from the DNMT1 knockout clone 9A ( Fig. 1 ). Although XIST RNA was detected from control female cells, no XIST expression was detected from either the parental cell line or the DNMT1 knockout cells ( Fig. 1A , lanes 1, 2 and 9). Lack of DNMT1 expression in the DNMT1 knockout cells was confirmed by RT–PCR ( Fig. 1B ).  Analysis of XIST expression in different MTase knockout HCT116 cells.

Lack of XIST expression in the DNMT1 knockout cells could be due to the maintenance of methylation of XIST 5′ region, or alternatively due to the absence of other factors required for XIST induction after demethylation. Therefore, methylation status of the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme Hha I, Ava I and Sac II sites at XIST 5′ end was analyzed by Southern blotting ( Figs 2 and 3 ). Unlike PCR-based assays, this approach allows detection of partial DNA demethylation patterns. Our results show that Xa-specific methylation of the 5′ end of XIST is retained in the DNMT1 knockout cells ( Figs 2B and 3B ). These data demonstrate maintenance of XIST methylation and transcriptional repression in the absence of DNMT1 activity.  Methylation status of the XIST 5′ end.

Maintenance of XIST repression in the absence of both DNMT1 and DNMT3BXIST expression was analyzed in the DNMT3B knockout and also in the DNMT1/DNMT3B DKO cells. Northern blot analysis revealed lack of XIST expression in DNMT3B knockout cells and, surprisingly, also in the DKO cells, which are known to present ∼95% reduction in the m 5 C content 30 ( Fig. 1 ). Lack of DNMT3B and of both DNMT3B and DNMT1 expression was confirmed in the DNMT3B knockout and DKO cells, respectively ( Fig. 1 ).  Methylation analysis of the XIST gene in different MTase knockout HCT116 cells was performed ( Figs 2 and 3 ). DNMT3B knockout cells maintained the four methylated sites present in the parental HCT116 ( Figs 2B and 3B ). In the DKO cells, maintenance of methylation of the Hha I and the downstream Sac II [ Sac II (2) ] sites was observed ( Figs 2B and 3B ). However, the Ava I site was completely unmethylated, as indicated by the presence of the 600 bp band and absence of the 3.2 kb band ( Fig. 2B ), and the upstream Sac II [ Sac II (1) ] site was only partially unmethylated, as indicated by the presence of the 800 bp band and absence of the 240 and 170 bp bands ( Fig. 3B ). Our results show that, while causing global DNA demethylation, lack of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B activity was not sufficient to disrupt maintenance of methylation specifically on the Hha I and Sac II (2) sites at the 5′end of XIST . 3.3. 5-aza-dC-mediated DNA demethylation induces XIST expression in HCT116 parental and knockout cells In order to investigate the effect of global demethylation on the maintenance of XIST transcriptional repression in HCT116 cells, these cells were treated with 5-aza-dC. Northern blot analysis revealed partial reactivation of the XIST gene in treated parental and all knockout HCT116 cells ( Fig. 1 ). 5-aza-dC treatment of DKO cells was less effective even at higher drug concentrations and longer treatment time (data not shown), probably due to the slower growth rate of these cells, as previously reported by Rhee et al. 30 Our results show that XIST expression from the Xa is induced by global DNA demethylation in HCT116 parental and knockout cells, as reported in human fibroblasts and in somatic cell hybrids containing the human Xa. 11 , 12 It is interesting to note that 5-aza-dC treatment also leads to higher expression of DNMT3B in HCT116 parental and DNMT1 knockout cells ( Fig. 1A ).  The methylation status of the 5′ region of the XIST gene in the 5-aza-dC treated HCT116 cells was analyzed ( Figs 2 and 3 ). Partial demethylation of the Ava I, Hha I and the two Sac II sites was observed in the treated cells expressing XIST ( Figs 2B and 3B ). Therefore, our data show that DNA methylation is involved in the control of XIST expression from the Xa in HCT116 cells, as already shown for a normal human cell line. 12 Moreover, these results show that the Hha I and Sac II (2) methylation sites are essential for XIST transcriptional control.  In mice, Dnmt1 is required for the maintenance of global DNA methylation, 27 , 28 and for the establishment of Xist methylation and maintenance of Xist repression on the Xa. 6 Therefore, Dnmt1 has been recognized as the major mammalian MTase involved in both imprinting and XCI. Rhee et al. 29 have challenged this idea by generating DNMT1 knockout HCT116 cells that retained most of the overall genomic methylation. Subsequently, Rhee et al. 30 showed that maintenance of global DNA methylation in HCT116 cells was lost only in the DNMT1/DNMT3B DKO cells, suggesting a cooperation between these two MTases. More recently, Ting et al. 33 demonstrated that inhibition of DNMT1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HCT116 cells did not affect global DNA methylation, corroborating the results of Rhee et al. 29 In addition, using the same siRNA approach in an epithelial ovarian cancer cell line, Leu et al. 34 observed that although DNMT1 has an important role in maintaining DNA methylation, deficiency of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B leads to a 2-fold increase in global DNA demethylation than DNMT1 deficiency alone. These data suggest that if indeed DNMT1 is a major maintenance MTase in humans, there must be other compensatory pathways for lack of DNMT1 expression in those human cancer cells.  Nevertheless, our results in the DNMT1/DNMT3B DKO cells demonstrate that, despite global DNA demethylation, XIST gene methylation and repression in the Xa can be maintained in the absence of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B activity. DKO cells present ∼5% of the normal levels of m 5 C, 30 which we show are partially targeted to the XIST gene, specifically to the Hha I and Sac II (2) sites, which appear to be sufficient for XIST repression.  Recently, lower expression of XIST in recurrent versus primary ovarian tumors has been reported, suggesting that directly or indirectly this gene may be important for the control of cell growth. 35 Thus, one cannot exclude that during the derivation of the DNMT1/DNMT3B DKO cells there could have been a selective advantage of those that maintained XIST methylation and transcriptional repression. Characterization of loss of hypermethylated CpG islands in the DKO cells leads to the identification of silenced tumor suppressor genes. 36 Conversely, the identification of the genomic regions that maintain DNA methylation in the DNMT1/DNMT3B DKO cells may point to genes whose transcriptional repression is essential for cell growth and/or viability.  In addition, since the 5-aza-dC experiments showed that XIST repression is dependent on DNA methylation in the HCT116 cells, our data indicate that MTases other than DNMT1 and DNMT3B must be involved in the process of XIST methylation in these cells. Currently, DNMT2 and DNMT3A are the only other known candidate MTases for this process. However, as in Arabidopsis , where at least 10 different MTase genes have been identified (reviewed in Martienssen and Colot 37 ), other unidentified DNA MTases may exist in mammals.  In conclusion, the observed discrepancy between maintenance of methylation of global DNA and of the XIST gene in the DKO HCT116 cells is unexpected since in mice these processes are mediated by the same enzyme, namely Dnmt1. 27 , 28 In the human DKO cells, although global DNA methylation is disrupted, XIST methylation at the Hha I and Sac II (2) sites is maintained. Therefore, our findings suggest that in humans different epigenetic mechanisms may control global and XIST gene expression and that XIST methylation can be mediated by other unknown factors. Additional experiments in normal human somatic cells using alternative gene inactivation approaches, such as siRNA, are required to confirm our observations and identify these factors.

Introduction Accumulation of a large amount of biological evidence has led to a need for systematization according to the cellular function of each molecule. Recent progress in computational science provides the scope for a possible solution to this issue, with database archiving of cellular pathways already having begun. For example, the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) is a quickly growing database designed to archive molecular interactions. 1–3 The BIND has already recorded >170 000 interactions and the resultant cellular pathways. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a widely used bioinformatics resource for understanding higher-order cell function. 4–6 The KEGG includes genomic and chemical information as well as pathway information. Furthermore, 166 pathway resources are now available online (Pathway Resource List, a catalog of pathway data resources, Author Webpage ). Although these databases have been based primarily on published experimental research, de novo molecular interactions are required not only to expand the pathways, but also to curate the details.  With this in mind, we have attempted to develop a pathway resource based on an accumulation of information regarding de novo molecular interactions. We have especially focused on the KIAA genes that were identified in our human cDNA sequencing project and that were functionally unknown at the time they were sequenced. 7 , 8 Specific molecules that capture proteins such as antibodies have become strong tools in the identification of molecular interactions. We have therefore begun to generate ‘libraries’ of antibodies against mouse counterparts of human KIAA proteins in order to overcome the legal and ethical restrictions on the use of human materials. 9 , 10 Using the ‘libraries’ of antibodies, we have begun to identify the endogenous mKIAA protein–protein interactions. Identified interactors are subsequently checked for their function and used to build the intracellular pathway involving the interaction. The inaugural version of the InCeP reveals only 18 intracellular pathways of mKIAA proteins, but further progress in our project promises to rapidly elucidate the function of many mKIAA proteins. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Identification of a novel protein–protein interaction Approximately 0.4 g of each adult mouse tissue (ICR strain, 8 weeks) or cell lines derived from mouse tumor was homogenized with CelLytic M (Sigma, St Louis, MO) containing 0.5% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-mKIAA antibody. The resulting precipitates were recovered in 20 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing of 0.2 M DTT by boiling for 10 min. The supernatant was resolved by 8% 1D-SDS–PAGE and then subjected to imidazole-zinc reverse staining. 11 , 12 All excised bands were digested with 10 µg/ml trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) for 16 h. After dilution with 1% TFA, the resulting peptide mixture was subjected to a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation on a MAGIC 2002 (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA). The peptides were first loaded onto polymeric reverse-phase packing material (Peptide Captrap, Michrom BioResources) for desalting and concentration, and then separated onto a reverse-phase capillary HPLC column (C18, 200 A, 0.2 mm × 50 mm, Michrom BioResources) with a flow rate of 5 µl/min. As solvents, 2% v/v acetonitrile in 0.1% v/v formic acid (solvent A) and 90% v/v acetonitrile in 0.1% v/v formic acid (solvent B) were used with a linear gradient from 5 to 65% of solvent B over 30 min. The chromatography system was coupled via a HTS-PAL (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) to an ion trap mass spectrometer LCQ (Thermo Finnigan, CA). The resulting MS/MS data were analyzed using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK). Proteins identified with a combined peptide score of >80 were considered significant, and lower-scoring proteins were rejected. 2.2. Pathway analysis Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA) is the world's largest curated database consisting of millions of individually modeled relationships between proteins, genes, complexes, cells, tissues, drugs and diseases. If researcher inputs a set of proteins into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, the software presents relevant pathways and diseases. Therefore, we first imported accession numbers of mKIAA and their interacting proteins identified as described in Section 2.1 into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The software then computed a score for each pathway according to the fit of the imported set of proteins. The score is derived from a P -value and indicates the likelihood of the focus proteins in a pathway being found together owing to random chance. A score of 2 indicates that there is a 1 in 100 chance that the focus proteins are together in same pathway owing to random chance. Therefore, scores of 2 or higher have at least a 99% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone. Biological functions were then calculated and assigned to each pathway. Subsequently, accession number of each component for the most relevant cellular pathway statistically selected was exported to another pathway analysis tool, PathwayAssist (Ariadne Genomics, Inc., Rockville, MD). The information of each node and edge was manually curated and updated through computerized searches in PubMed ( Author Webpage ). The curation of each record was performed by an MD or PhD-level scientist. Essential links to PubMed citations and our original data were performed on PathwayAssist, because the software is superior to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in manual reconstruction of the graphical views. 2.3. Database constructionThe InCeP database is written in Java. The Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) are implemented by the Apache Jakarta Tomcat Servlet/JSP container and communicate with the Oracle Database 10g (Relational Database Server) and the JDBC driver (the interface programs for the database). The recommended web client is Internet Explore 6.0 browser or higher.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Identification of a novel mKIAA protein–protein interaction To identify novel mKIAA protein–protein interactions, we performed MS/MS analysis following immunoprecipitation with anti-mKIAA antibodies. Expecting efficient identification, we selected highly expressed tissues or cell lines based on the information obtained from western blotting. Some of these data are freely available through our InGaP database (Integrative Gene and Protein expression database; Author Webpage ) in which information about mKIAA gene/proteins consisting of cDNA microarray analysis, subcellular localization of the ectopically expressed gene and experimental data generated from use of the anti-mKIAA antibody such as western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses are recorded. 13 Functional annotation of mKIAA-interactors provides information important in conceiving a functional hypothesis of mKIAA proteins based on the molecular network. Although the identified molecules may interact with corresponding mKIAA in an indirect manner, it is conceivable that at least these molecules function along the same cellular pathway. One example is the mKIAA1027 protein, also known as talin 1. Already distinct functional annotation had been obtained from numerous experimental studies. This protein plays a significant role in the cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix adhesions through interactions with the intracellular domain of integrin β. 14–16 Although these previous efforts have clarified the functional importance of mKIAA1027/talin 1 in the transduction of integrin signal, we have identified a novel interaction of mKIAA1027/talin 1 supposing a completely different functional aspect. Promyelocytic leukemia (Gene Symbol in Fig. 1 is PML) was found in immunoprecipitant with anti-mKIAA1027 antibody ( Fig. 2 ). Pml was originally identified as fusion protein with retinoic acid receptor α, which causes acute promyelocytic leukemia. 17 Although the tumor-suppressive role of PML has been attributed to its ability to regulate the transcriptional function of nuclear tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb, 18 several cytoplasmic PML (cPML) isoforms of unknown function have also been described. 19 , 20 Most recently, Lin et al . 21 have identified a novel function of cPML as an essential modulator of TGF-β signaling. Likewise, our finding suggests that cPML might modulate integrin β-mKIAA1027/talin 1 signaling.  Schematic representation of the pathway including mKIAA1027.

Non-specifically binding proteins to sepharose column and antibodies reduce the reliability of identified interactors. Considering this point, we have also determined all non-specifically binding proteins in each tissue or cell line by MS/MS analysis (for instance, Ogdh protein and transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase are observed in most of the tissues). If we detect these proteins in the excised band which is assumed to be mKIAA-interactor, these proteins are excluded from further construction of corresponding mKIAA-pathway. The reproducibility of these interactions should also be assessed. To strengthen the reliability, we performed at least two independent experiments and confirmed the interactions (mKIAA0035, mKIAA0675, mKIAA0994 and mKIAA1465) at initial stage of our study.3.2. Data representation and usage of the InCeP database The inaugural version of the InCeP database provides users 18 intracellular pathways, including endogenous mKIAA protein interactions, in HTML format ( Table 1 ). This information has been manually curated from selected publications. The InCeP database is accessible through the CREATE portal ( Author Webpage ) ( Fig. 3A ). Clicking on InCeP, the InCeP home page will open. Similar to this operation, users can easily access to the InGaP database. To locate pathways, a user can simply search using the mKIAA number, the accession number or the clone name. Alternatively, a user can find a pathway related to a particular disease or tissue ( Fig. 3B ). On the summary page, an overview of each pathway is represented by edges (protein, protein complex, small molecule and phenomena) and nodes (several kinds of interactions) ( Fig. 3C ). Clicking on each edge or node, a user can directly obtain a variety of supplementary data such as detailed information for the molecules and a PubMed citation for the interaction ( Fig. 3D ). mKIAA protein interactions developed from ‘in-house’ assays are also displayed by simple clicking of the corresponding node.

Concluding Remarks We have previously placed a strong emphasis on integration of several kinds of biological knowledge. 13 With respect to this issue, we have launched the InGaP database, a comprehensive database of gene/protein expression profiles using cDNA microarray and anti-mKIAA antibodies. The InCeP is defined as a sister database of the InGaP; concomitant use of these databases may therefore accelerate our appreciation of the function of mKIAA/KIAA proteins. Furthermore, a bidirectional accumulation of information is the expected next step of InCeP development. We are currently developing a graphical analysis tool using the SVG format that will enable us to supplement user's data on the internet through our resources. The user's data as well as the records of our novel interactions would facilitate consolidation of the intracellular pathway involving mKIAA/KIAA proteins. We expect that our strategy will be an ‘InCePtive’ approach to discovering molecular mechanisms related to other hypothetical proteins. We are grateful to all the staff who have worked on our project.

IntroductionGenome comparison involving closely related organisms can be useful for understanding the mechanisms of genome rearrangements and for identifying elements that participate in them.1,2 During examination of a large chromosomal rearrangement that was seen when a comparison was made between two genomes of Neisseria meningitidis,3 we encountered filamentous prophages.The filamentous bacteriophages have a single-stranded circular DNA genome.4 Some of them, such as M13, propagate in a double-stranded circular form in their host bacteria,4 whereas others, such as CTXφ of Vibrio cholerae, integrate themselves into the host chromosome.5 So far, their integration is known to be mediated by one of two types of tyrosine recombinases: integration into a dif-like site by the host-encoded XerC/D recombinase6 and integration into a tRNA gene by the phage-encoded recombinase.7 Quite different from these tyrosine recombinases in sequence and molecular mechanism are the pivNM/irg genes3,8–10 that belong to the Piv subfamily of the IS110/IS492 transposase family of RNaseH/Retrovial Integrase superfamily.9,11 The irg genes in Neisseria gonorrhoeae were regarded as the transposases of small insertion sequence (IS) elements,10 which were found linked with two homologues of filamentous phage proteins and were thought to be integrated into the host chromosome as part of the bacteriophage genome.10In the present work, we identified prophages of this family in four Neisseria genomes and named this phage family Nf (Neisserial filamentous phages). We found that each intact copy of Nf carries a pivNM/irg homologue at their right end. Our further analysis strongly indicates that this phage family is integrated by a novel mechanism using its own PivNM/Irg transposase. This transposase is probably responsible for variously rearranged prophage genomes. Recently, Bille et al.12 published an experimental work that was in agreement with ours (see Section 3.6).2.

The genome sequence of N. meningitidis serogroup C strain FAM18 (NmeC) was obtained from The Sanger Institute (). Accession numbers for the sequences of plasmids, filamentous phages and IS are as follows: pJS-B (NC_004758.1),13 pJTPS1 (NC_001399.1),14 pMU1 (NC_007093.1),15 M13 (NC_003287.2),16 Pf1 (NC_001331.1),17 Pf3 (NC_001418.1),18 VGJφ (NC_004736.1),19 B5 (NC_003460.1),20 IS621(AB097054-AB097056).9We used the entries of the complete genome sequences of NmeA, NmeB and Ngo in the NCBI RefSeq () for gene names, amino acid sequences and coordinates.

Bioinformatic analysisThe searches for macroscopic genome rearrangements and conserved gene clusters were performed by CGAT22 and MBGD23 (Author Webpage), respectively. CGAT was used to detect nucleotide sequence homology of a locus with the other parts of the genome. MBGD was used to detect homologous open reading frames (ORFs) and their neighbouring genes.A homology search was performed by BLAST24 and fasta2 package.25 Multiple sequence alignments were constructed by ClustalW.26 Default parameters were used unless otherwise specified. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using ClustalW, NJplot27 and TreeViewPPC (Author Webpage).3. Results and Discussion3.1. Filamentous prophages in the genomes of NeisseriaIn Table 1, we have listed all Nf prophages that were found in the four Neisseria genomes.First, we describe the nomenclature of Nf prophages. Nf4-G1(del) may be used as an example of our nomenclature of Nf prophages. Here (i) ‘Nf’ stands for Neisseria filamentous phage, (ii) ‘4’ stands for subtype (subtype 1–4, as classified in Section 3.1.3), (iii) ‘G’ stands for strain (A for NmeA, B for NmeB, C for NmeC and G for Ngo), (iv) ‘1’ stands for ordinal number within a subtype that is found within the same genome (a smaller number was given to the copy with smaller genome coordinates; for exceptions, see footnotes f–h of Table 1), and (v) ‘(del)’ stands for internal deletion. Partially inverted, truncated and internally deleted copies are designated as ‘(inv)’, ‘(tr)’ and ‘(del)’, respectively. The putative intact copies are not given such a description.We followed the following terminology. ‘A copy of Nf’ means a stretch of DNA sequence that encodes at least one gene that is homologous to the genes of ‘consensus, intact’ Nfs. By ‘the left/right of Nfs’, we mean the left/right of Nfs, as shown in Fig. 1A. ‘Intact’ copies are those that encode a potentially full set of homologues of phage genes that are oriented in the same direction and carry the expected left and right junction sequences (see Section 3.2 for a determination of the junctions). An only ‘partially inverted’ copy [Nf4-G2(inv)] resembles the intact copies, except for partial inversion of its irg gene (irg2) region. ‘Truncated’ copies of Nfs are the copies with truncation of the right end or the left end. Three of the irg copies (irg1, 4 and 8) are not neighboured by the homologues of the above conserved genes.10 However, three regions containing these irg genes have the expected left and right junctions (see Section 3.3.2), so we regarded them as ‘internally deleted’ copies of Nfs and named them Nf4-G1(del), Nf4-G4(del) and Nf4-G8(del) (Fig. 1A).Nf filamentous prophages on Neisseria chromosome, other filamentous bacteriophages and related plasmids.

We also found several homologous prophages on the other loci. We named these prophages Nfs (for Neisserial filamentous phages).By investigating four sequenced Neisseria genomes (NmeA, NmeB, NmeC and Ngo), we identified 23 copies of Nf, including 11 intact, 1 partially inverted, 8 truncated and 3 internally deleted copies (Table 1). Two right-truncated homologues were located at the corresponding loci in three N. meningitidis genomes but not in the N. gonorrhoeae genome—that is, Nf2-A1(tr), Nf2-B1(tr) and Nf2-C1(tr) are at one corresponding locus and Nf2-A2(tr), Nf2-B2(tr) and Nf2-C2(tr) are at the other locus. So, there are 23 copies of Nf at 19 different loci in the four genomes. Notably, all the 11 intact and the 1 partially inverted copies are located at 12 different loci.All the 11 intact copies and the 1 partially inverted copy of Nfs are ∼8 kb in length (Table 1), with gene organization being similar to that of filamentous phages (Fig. 1A versus B), except for the presence of a pivNM/irg transposase gene homologue at the right end (Fig. 1A).As well as previously noticed homologues of the rstA protein of filamentous phage CTXφ (for phage DNA replication; corresponding to gII of M13) (NMA1792 and other brown arrows in Fig. 1A) and gI protein (for assembly) (NMA1799 and other light-blue arrows in Fig. 1A),10 we found other Nf genes corresponding to filamentous phage genes (gV, gVIII, gIII and gVI) by in silico research (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figure S1 is available at Author Webpage). In Fig. 1, these functionally corresponding, but not necessarily homologous, genes are shown with the same color.Genes that are conserved among Nfs are oriented in the same direction (Fig. 1A), except for NGO1137 (irg2) of Nf4-G2(inv) (as discussed in Section 3.3.1). We assumed that their sense strand represents their single-strand (plus strand) within the presumed virion.Plasmids that have genes that are homologous to those of Nf are also shown (Fig. 1C). pJS-B13 from N. meningitidis ET37, and pJTPS114 from Ralstonia solanacearum, do not carry a pivNM/irg homologue, whereas pMU115 from Eikenella corrodens does.We classified the Nfs into four subtypes, Nf1–Nf4, based on similarity of their three long ORFs: phage DNA replication protein homologues (corresponding to pII; homologous with rstA of CTXφ; brown arrows in Fig. 1A), adsorption protein homologues (corresponding to pIII; previously annotated as TspB) (yellow arrows in Fig. 1A) and pI homologues (light-blue arrows in Fig. 1A) [Fig. 2A, (1)–(3)], and by overall nucleotide sequence similarity (data not shown).Comparison of phylogenetic trees of three Nf proteins and transposase on Nf.

The branch of Nf4-G2(inv), which was located differently from those of the other Nf4 copies, can be explained by the assumption that Nf4-G2(inv) might have resulted from recombination between an Nf3-like copy and an Nf4 copy. In fact, the right 5942 bp part of Nf4-G2(inv) is similar to the corresponding part, if any, of the other Nf4 copies (data not shown), whereas its left part contains three regions: the left junction (see Section 3.2.2), the phage DNA replication protein (NGO1146) gene [Fig. 2A, (1)] and the cg stem–loop (Supplementary Figure S1E is available at Author Webpage), all of which are highly similar to those of Nf3-A but not to those of other Nf4s.3.2. Junctions of integrated Nf prophages and the host genomeExcept for the right junction of Nf2 and Nf3, all the junctions were determined by alignment of copies of the same subtype, as detailed below (Sections 3.2.1–3.2.5). To determine the right junctions of Nf2 and Nf3, we took advantage of the formation of a promoter-like sequence by joining the right and the left ends of Nfs, as described below (Section 3.2.6).The dRS3 repeats constitute one family of repeated sequences in Neisseria and have a consensus sequence of attcccnnnnnnnngggaat.8 Alignment of Nf1 copies (as shown in Fig. 3A) can be interpreted as Nf1s being able to target 5′-CT in specific members of the dRS3 repeat family, attccc(g/a)cCT(g/a)cgcgg(g/a)aa(t/g), and were integrated forming flanking direct repeats of 5′-CT. The consensus sequence that was targeted by Nf1 (5′-attcccgcCTgcgcgggaat) is the most abundant sequence of the dRS3 repeats (291 out of 672 copies in NmeA).DNA features of Nf prophages.

The lengths between the −35-like sequence and the −10-like sequence of the predicted circular form of Nfs are indicated below the alignment. In the last line, a typical eubacterial promoter sequence recognized by the primary σ factors28,29 is illustrated. (F) Predicted right junction of Nf2-B3 and Nf3-A. Candidate sequences for flanking atCT of Nf2-B3 and Nf3-A are aligned and compared with the −35 sequence.For the other three subtypes, we could not find any obvious similarity or pattern in the flanking sequences, although some sequences were observed several times—that is, aaac flanks the left of two Nf2 copies and two Nf4 copies and cgtca flanks the right of four Nf4 copies (Fig. 3B and C).From a comparison of the left junction of three groups—Nf1 (Fig. 3A), Nf2 and Nf4 [Fig. 3B, (1)], and Nf3-A and Nf4-G2(inv) [Fig. 3B, (2)]—we concluded that the sequence 5′-CTtatat represents the left junction sequence for all of the Nfs examined [Fig. 3B, (3)].From a comparison of the right junction sequences of Nf1 (Fig. 3A) and Nf4 [Fig. 3C, (1)], we found that the right junction sequence that is common to Nf1 and Nf4 is 5′-atCT [Fig. 3C, (2)]. The ‘T’ of the atCT of Nf4 is the residue that is reported to be at the 3′ end of aligned downstream regions of irg genes.10As filamentous phages have a circular phage genome,4 it is reasonable to assume that Nf1 and Nf4 would have a circular phage genome before integration. From the comparison of the common left and right junctions of Nf1 and Nf4 [Fig. 3D, (1)], the sequence at the junction of the hypothetical circular form is predicted to be 5′-atCTtatat [Fig. 3D, (2)].Notably, we found that pMU1, which has the homologous gene set with Nf (see Section 3.1.2 and Fig. 1C), has this predicted junction sequence (5′-atCTtatat) at the corresponding locus—that is, between the pivNM/irg homologue and the replication protein homologue [at position 3757–3749 bp; Fig. 3D, (3)].The sequence that is shared between the right end of Nf1 and Nf4 (5′-tgttgncn) partially matched with 5′-ttgaca, a typical −35 sequence of the −35 element of eubacterial promoters that is recognized by primary σ factors28,29 (boxed in solid, thick line in Fig. 3E). Because the predicted junction of the hypothetical circular form of Nf, atCTtatatnnt, contains a −10 promoter-like sequence (boxed with dotted line in Fig. 3E), we assumed that the junction region forms a promoter in the circular form.The related plasmid pMU1 (see Fig. 1C) also carries this promoter-like sequence (Fig. 3E). The pivNM/irg homologue of pMU1 is most similar to the pivNM/irg of Nfs so far.The transposase gene of IS621 is another close homologue of pivNM/irg.9 The left end of IS621 is CTtgtat and the right end is atCT (Fig. 3E), the former being similar to the left end of Nfs and the latter being identical to their right end. IS621 would also form a promoter-like sequence after assumed circularization (Fig. 3E).The promoter-like sequence of the predicted circular form of Nfs and pMU1 could regulate the expression of phage replication gene, although some Nfs code another short ORF between the promoter-like sequence and this gene [e.g. Nf1-B1, Nf1-B2, Nf3-A and Nf4-G2(inv); Fig. 1A].We cannot determine the right junction of Nf2 and Nf3 by alignment, as with Nf1 and Nf4, because Nf2-B3 and Nf3-A are the single examples of the Nf2 and Nf3 subtypes, respectively, that have an intact right junction (Fig. 1A).Instead, we assumed that both Nf2-B3 and Nf3-A would have an atCT sequence at the right junction, as Nf1 and Nf4 copies. Because the right junction sequence atCT of Nf1 and Nf4 is located at 142 and 129 bp, respectively, downstream of the stop codon of pivNM/irg (Fig. 3E), we searched the range of 250 bp downstream of the stop codon of pivNM in Nf2-B3 and Nf3-A and found atCT at only one site in Nf2-B3 and at two sites in Nf3-A (Fig. 3F). Next, we looked for a potential −35 element upstream of these three candidate sequences and found a −35-like ttgann sequence in two of them (boxed with solid line in Fig. 3F). From these, we concluded that the right junction of Nf2-B3 and Nf3-A is atCT that is located 162 and 145 bp, respectively, downstream of the pivNM gene.Altogether, we concluded that Nfs are flanked with CT at both ends. The common sequence at the left end of Nf is CTtatat, and that at the right end is atCT, as seen in Fig. 3D, (1).3.3. Rearranged NfsThe irg2 gene of Nf4-G2(inv), a transposase homologue, is inverted relative to the other three genes10 and the remaining Nf4 homology (Fig. 1A). From a comparison with the intact copies of Nf4, the recombination sites of this partial inversion are identified as the 5 bp sequence (boxed in alignment of Fig. 4A). One recombination site, CTtat, is a part of the right junction CTtatat (an open triangle and underlined in Fig. 4A), which is composed of the right direct repeat (CT) and the flanking 5 bp host sequence (tatat; shown in italics). The other recombination site, ataAG (complement is CTtat), is located between irg2 and the other genes of Nf4-G2(inv) (Fig. 4A). This sequence is complementary to the 5′ bp sequence of the left common junction sequence of Nf, CTtat, and is located 10, 8 and 9 bp upstream of the start codon of pivNM/irg in Nf1, Nf2 and Nf4, respectively. Nf3 has a similar sequence (gtaAG) at 10 bp upstream. The ataAG sequence partially overlaps with the ribosome binding site aaggr, according to Skaar et al.10Rearranged Nfs. Sequence alignments are shown for the relevant regions. A filled triangle, a filled circle and an inverted filled triangle indicate three conserved motifs of Nf, the left junction, the right junction, and a 5 bp sequence that is complementary to the left junction as in Figs 1 and 3.

The thick arrow indicates a sequence that is involved in the replicative transposition event to form long inverted repeats. Boxes in dashed line with dots indicate short repeats that are probably responsible for deletion.This inversion structure is perfectly consistent with conservative site-specific recombination involving the 5 bp sequences. The inversion was probably mediated by PivNM/Irg itself on an integrated form of a presumed parental Nf4-G2 (the second line of Fig. 4A) because the right junction (atCT) of the parental Nf4-G2 sequence, as well as the flanking host sequence (tatat) is the same as the predicted junction of the hypothetical circular form of Nfs, atCTtatat (underlined with a dotted line in Fig. 4A). Alternatively, the inversion could have occurred on the circular form of an Nf4 member. If so, the partially inverted circular form may have been integrated into the chromosome by Irg2-mediated recombination between the junction sequence …ccCTtatatat… [Fig. 4A and 3B, (2)] and a chromosomal sequence …acCTtatatgc… [Fig. 3B, (2) and 4A].The irg1, 4 and 8 genes are the only exceptions of the pivNM/irg homologues that are not neighboured by the homologues of phage genes at the left (Fig. 1A). The region downstream of these irg genes to atCT, the right junction of Nfs, is highly homologous to that in the other Nf4 copies [Fig. 3C, (1)]. At a variable distance upstream from the irg genes, we identified the left junction sequence of Nfs, CTtatat [Fig. 4B, (1) and (2)]. We named these regions bound by these junction sequences: Nf4-G1(del), Nf4-G4(del) and Nf4-G8(del).Indeed, the left 33 bp sequence of Nf4-G4(del) (solid, rightward arrow) aligned well with the left end of the intact Nf4 copies (Nf4-G3 and Nf4-G5) [Fig. 4B, (1)]. Notably, the complementary strand of the sequence just upstream of irg4 aligned longer with the left end of intact Nf4 [dotted arrows in Fig. 4B, (1)]. In Nf4-G4(del), the left end of the 33 bp sequence (CTtatat…) and the 34 bp sequence upstream of irg […atataAG; solid, leftward arrow in Nf4-G4(del) of Fig. 4B, (1)] form inverted repeats (33/34 bp match). Note that the right junction (ataAG; boxed and indicated by an inverted triangle in Fig. 4B, (1)] is the same site as the recombination sequence for partial inversion (see Section 3.3.1 and Fig. 4A).Another putative deletion derivative, Nf4-G8(del), aligned very well with Nf4-G4(del) with a deletion [Fig. 4B, (2)]. Nf4-G1(del) aligned well with these two deletion derivatives, [Nf4-G4(del) and Nf4-G8(del)], and with the intact Nf4s (Nf4-G3 and Nf4-G5) with a deletion [Fig. 4B, (2)].Formation of Nf4-G8(del) is readily explained by illegitimate recombination involving short direct repeats, ccct (boxed in dashed line), in an Nf4-G4(del)-type parent [Fig. 4B, (2)]. Deletions stimulated by palindromic sequences were shown to occur between short direct repeats in the laboratory.30,31Similarly, Nf4-G1(del) would be formed through illegitimate recombination involving short direct repeats, tgcgt (boxed in dotted line), from these types of deletion derivatives [Nf4-G4(del) and Nf4-G8(del)] or from the intact Nf4 copies [Fig. 4B, (2)]. As the parent, we prefer the structure of Nf4-G4(del), or similar, with long inverted repeats, as the inverted repeats will stimulate and select this type of deletion.31Formation of Nf4-G4(del) from intact Nf4 copies can be explained by the following replicative transposition model. (i) A copy of a region of the left terminus (longer than 33 bp) is inserted into the left of the ataAG sequence upstream of the transposase gene. This is a reaction that is similar to replicative transposition. The transposase may have recognized a secondary site within Nf as in one-ended transposition.32 (ii) The resulting long inverted repeats make the entire region unstable and cause or select an illegitimate recombination event involving a short sequence identity (aaggg). This mechanism is the same as we proposed for the other two deletion derivatives. This model can provide a uniform explanation to the formation of the three deletion derivatives.Although these three copies are probably deletion derivatives of intact Nfs, the possibility remains that they are integrated into these sites after the deletion event. Unfortunately, we do not know how much of the Nf sequence is necessary in cis for integration or whether these three copies can express a functional transposase. The deletion in Nf4-G1(del) apparently removed the first residue of the start codon of the irg gene [Fig. 4B, (2)] and resulted in the start codon of NGO0772 (irg1) to be 33 bp upstream from the left end of Nf4-G1(del).3.4. Simple insertion revealed by comparison with another genome without NfComparison of Nf1-A integrated into NmeA with the corresponding unoccupied locus of Ngo (Fig. 5A) made it clear that the target sequence of Nf1-A integration is CT.

(B) Nf4-G1(del).Comparison of one of the internally deleted copies, Nf4-G1(del), in Ngo with the corresponding unoccupied locus in NmeA strongly indicated that it also targeted CT (Fig. 5B). According to the comparison between Ngo and NmeA, the target sequence of Nf4-G8(del) also seems to be CT, although the two base pairs that are 3′ to CT are different from those in the corresponding unoccupied locus. For the other copies, comparison is not straight forward because of the complex structures that flank them.3.5. Alternative models for Nf integrationIn some of the above arguments (see Section 3.3), we implicitly assumed that PivNM/Irg transposase that is present on the Nf phage genome is likely to have mediated integration of the phage genome into the chromosome. In this section, we will list the alternative models and provide evidence against them.The first model we have been pursuing (A) is that the Nf phage was integrated by its own pivNM/irg transposase (transposase-as-integrase model). Three other models are as follows: (B) Nf without pivNM/irg was integrated by some unspecified mechanism and later the pivNM/irg was inserted as IS (phage-then-IS model); (C) pivNM/irg was inserted into the Nf phage genome and later the phage genome with pivNM/irg was integrated by some unspecified mechanism unrelated to pivNM/irg (phage-with-IS model) and (D) the pivNM/irg was inserted into the chromosome as IS and later, by some unspecified mechanism, Nf without pivNM/irg was integrated between the left junction of the IS and the start codon of pivNM/irg (IS-then-phage model). An idea similar to the phage-with-IS model was presented earlier.10Below, the transposase-as-integrase model (model A) is discussed in comparison with the other three models (models B–D). Models B–D provide no explanation as to how the phage was integrated into the chromosome. On the other hand, model A is straightforward by explaining that pivNM/irg transposase acts as the integrase for integration of Nf.Tight linkage of phage-related genes of the Nf and pivNM/irg gene is a straightforward consequence of models A and C, but is not a straightforward consequence of models B and D. The apparently solitary irg genes [Nf4-G1(del), Nf4-G4(del) and Nf4-G8(del)] can be explained by deletion from an intact copy of Nf as detailed above (see Section 3.3.2). This supports model A. These deletion events may have happened after the integration of Nf, although the possibility that the deletion derivatives were integrated as simple IS cannot be excluded (see Section 3.3.2). Thus, we cannot exclude model D from this argument, but it is difficult to explain, by model D, why Nfs without pivNM/irg specifically target the fixed point between the left junction of ISpivNM/irg and the start codon of pivNM/irg and why they are not integrated to the other loci of Neisseria genomes.Similarity of the junction sequences of Nf and IS621, the second closest homologue of pivNM/irg of Nf (see Section 3.2.5), supports the idea that both junctions of Nf were derived from the activity of PivNM/Irg and supports models A and D but not the other two models.The closest homologue of pivNM/irg is the one that is coded on pMU1. pMU1 has the pivNM/irg homologue, along with other homologues of Nf phage genes (see Section 3.1.2 above and Fig. 1C). pMU1 encodes pivNM/irg and has an atCTtatat sequence, which is exactly the predicted junction sequence for the hypothetical circular form of Nf at the corresponding locus (see Section 3.2.4 above and Fig. 3E). This form resembles an intermediate form of transposition of several IS families, such as the IS3 family.33,34 Nf and pMU1, along with IS621, have the assembled promoter-like sequence (see Section 3.2.5 and Fig. 3). IS492 of the same IS110/IS492 family as pivNM/irg takes a circular form with the junction consisting of a single copy of the direct repeats and with a promoter-like sequence.35 These points argue for the possibility that Nfs are likely to have a circular form together with pivNM/irg and that the predicted junction sequence ‘CT’ is similar to that of pMU1 and support models A and D but not the other two models.Each of the subtypes, Nf1–Nf4, carries a distinct type of pivNM/irg gene (pivNM1/irg7 for Nf1, pivNM2 for Nf2, pivNM3 for Nf3 and irg1-6, 8 for Nf4), as revealed by phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2A compared with 2B). This means that the copies of one subtype of Nf are linked with one specific subtype of pivNM/irg and vice versa; this is compatible with models A and C. On the other hand, in models B and D, there is no obvious reason to assume that copies of the same subtype of Nf carry pivNM/irg genes of the same type.Amino acid sequences of phage-related genes of Nf2 and Nf4 are similar [Fig. 2A, (1)–(3)], but those of their transposases, pivNM2 and irg, are not similar to each other (Fig. 2B). Nucleotide sequences of the central regions of Nf2 and Nf4 are also similar but those of pivNM2 and irg are diverged (data not shown). This might support models B and D, which indicate that there are different origins for phages and pivNM/irg. However, if we assume that the pivNM/irg of each subtype was somehow inserted independently into Nf (Nf without pivNM/irg), models A and C would be supported. pJS-B and pJTPS1 have similar gene organizations to that of Nf, but do not encode the pivNM/irg homologue nor have an atCTtatat junction sequence (Fig. 1C). Independent insertion of pivNM/irg into the circular form of Nf without pivNM/irg (like pJS-B) might have occurred during evolution. The mechanism of this insertion might be different from that of Nf integration into bacterial chromosomes because Nf integration is marked by flanking CT repeats, whereas we could not find such duplication for pivNM/irg insertion into hypothetical Nf without pivNM/irg, although we cannot exclude the possibility that loss of the CT sequence was selected.From the above observations and considerations, we concluded that the most likely mechanism is the transposase-as-integrase model (model A). The circular form of Nf before integration into (and after excision, if any, from) the chromosome would have an atCTtatat sequence at the junction and recombine with the target CT of the chromosome by the activity of the PivNM/Irg transposase. Although this reaction mechanism is similar to that of site-specific recombinase, Piv family proteins do not have amino acid motifs that are conserved among the tyrosine- or serine-recombinase families,11 but are similar to DDE transposases.36This mechanism is distinct from the two currently known mechanisms for filamentous phage integration, integration into a dif-like site mediated by XerC/D site-specific tyrosine-recombinase6 and integration into tRNA probably mediated by an integrase of the tyrosine-recombinase family.73.6. Comparison with the work by Bille et al.12After this work was completed, Bille et al.12 published an experimental work of which some results are in agreement with those that we described above. Their results related to ours are listed below [(i)–(vi)], whereas the findings that are specific to our work are also listed [(a)–(e)].(i) Discovery of filamentous phages (corresponding to seven intact copies of Nf1, according to our naming) in the genomes of Neisseria based on observations of their low G+C content, homology of the first ORF to bacteriophage replication proteins and the similarity to the order and size of ORFs that are encoded by other filamentous phages. (ii) Those phages (Nf1) are inserted into dRS3. (iii) Extrachromosomal circular single-stranded DNA of one prophage (Nf1-A, according to our naming) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). (iv) Junction of the circular form was sequenced. (v) The region containing the pivNM gene was contained in the circular form, as judged from the length of PCR products (supporting our result that pivNM/irg genes are integral part of Nfs). (vi) The inactivation of four genes—NMA1792, 1797 and 1799 on Nf1-A and pilQ on a locus of the host chromosome—had predicted effects on extracellular and cytoplasmic circular DNA forms.Our findings that are not overlapping with theirs are as follows: (a) we found and characterized not only the Nf1 subtype, but also three other subtypes (Nf2, Nf3 and Nf4). (b) The left and right sequences common to all the four Nf subtypes are CTtatat and atCT, respectively. (c) Our analyses strongly indicate that the integration of Nf is mediated by its own PivNM/Irg transposase (transposase-as-integrase model). (d) We identified and characterized structural variants of Nfs. We were able to explain their origin in terms of aberrant activity of this transposase. (e) We also added further bioinformatic evidence that ORFs of Nfs correspond to proteins of filamentous phages.Note that their work12 further supports the transposase-as-integrase model. Our results proved the power of bioinformatic approach through genome comparison for detailed and thorough analysis of mobile elements and genome rearrangements.We thank Noriko Takahashi and Takeshi Tsuru for helpful suggestions on the manuscript.

Introduction The intron region, which is processed immediately after transcription, has been identified in protein-coding and RNA-coding genes in many organisms. As shown in Fig. 1 , the mechanisms for splicing of the introns already characterized were classified in the group I, II, III, nuclear mRNA and tRNA introns. Mechanisms for splicing of Group I, II, III and tRNA introns. Schematic outline of splicing mechanism for Group I intron is shown in A, for Group II, III and nuclear mRNA introns in B and for archaeal and nuclear tRNA introns in C. As shown in A, Group I intron requires the attack and cleavage by the hydroxyl group in GTP. In Group II or III intron, self-attacking by hydroxyl group in adenosine in intron region is necessary, as shown in B. In spite of these two mechanisms, the specific endonuclease is required for recognition and cleavage of intron portion in the archaeal and eukaryotic tRNA genes, and following enzymatic ligation is occurred.Mechanisms for splicing of Group I, II, III and tRNA introns. Schematic outline of splicing mechanism for Group I intron is shown in A, for Group II, III and nuclear mRNA introns in B and for archaeal and nuclear tRNA introns in C. As shown in A, Group I intron requires the attack and cleavage by the hydroxyl group in GTP. In Group II or III intron, self-attacking by hydroxyl group in adenosine in intron region is necessary, as shown in B. In spite of these two mechanisms, the specific endonuclease is required for recognition and cleavage of intron portion in the archaeal and eukaryotic tRNA genes, and following enzymatic ligation is occurred. It is known that introns in tRNA genes, which encode RNA molecules necessary to transfer the amino acids to ribosome, are identified in many organisms, Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea. The tRNA introns in Bacteria can be classified into group I or II intron, that are processed with GTP or by intron itself without other factor, respectively ( Fig. 1A and B ). Conversely, the tRNA introns in Eukarya or Archaea lack any identifiable sequence or structure to group I, II, III or mRNA introns as indicated in Fig. 1C . 1 Previous analysis indicated that tRNA introns in Eukarya were recognized their mature structure by tRNA endonuclease during the cleavage of the introns. 2 In this structure, the tRNA portion of the precursor maintains an L-shaped conformation, stabilized by the interaction between the D and TΨC loops. The 3′ splice site junction is always single-stranded. 3,In vitro and in vivo analyses have shown that the cleavage sites of intron in eukaryotic tRNA molecules are identified by a measurement mechanism that senses the distance from the center of the molecule, possibly the top of the anticodon stem, to the 5′ and 3′ cleavage sites, as shown in Fig. 2A . 4 , 5 Because of this mechanism for the processing of intron portion in Eukarya, the intron in eukaryotic tRNA genes is located only at one base 3′ from anticodon region. Two different mechanisms recognizing introns in tRNA genes. A: In the measurement mechanism, which is utilized in eukaryotic tRNA genes, the enzymes processing the tRNA introns recognize the distance between anticodon stem and both cleavage sites. B: In the archaeal tRNA genes, the bulge–helix–bulge motif is necessary for recognition of splicing site. Splicing sites are indicated by short arrow. Y indicates pyrimidine nucleotides; R indicates purine nucleotides. O and X indicate the non-conserved nucleotides in the regions with conserved structure and non-conserved structure, respectively.Two different mechanisms recognizing introns in tRNA genes.

In contrast to eukaryotic mechanism, it is found that the recognition and cleavage of the intron region by the archaeal intron endonuclease does not require the complete mature tRNA structure, but requires a defined structural element at the exon–intron boundaries, referred to as the bulge–helix–bulge motif shown in Fig. 2B . 6 , 7 This mechanism is well suited for the fact that archaeal tRNA introns are not restricted to a single location. The previous researches were targeted toward some specific intron-containing tRNA molecules in Archaea, which led to the discovery of an archaeal tRNA intron in the anticodon loop, the anticodon stem and the extra arm. 8–13 The previous analyses of the splicing mechanism of the tRNA introns in Archaea have been also performed for the restricted tRNA genes in some archaeal species, 11 most of which were halophilic Archaea. 8 , 9 Experimental analysis of splicing mechanism of archaeal tRNA intron and experimental confirmation of splicing pattern of tRNA molecule using the entire set of tRNA genes in one microorganism have not been previously performed. Hence, it is necessary to examine the entire tRNA system in one microorganism in order to understand the actual expression and splicing mechanism in the complete tRNA system.  To date, the entire nucleotide sequences for 16 archaeal genomes have been determined. From this genomic data, the tRNA genes, that were interrupted by an intron, were identified in both the Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota. Though the genomes of the Euryarchaeota contain a limited number of interrupted tRNA genes, computational analysis predicted 14 and 24 interrupted tRNA genes in two Crenarchaea, Aeropyrum pernix K1 and Sulfolobus tokodaii strain7, respectively. 14 , 15 Also noteworthy was the observation that tRNA genes containing an intron longer than 40 nt were predicted in both genomes and that the tRNA genes interrupted by the intron at the other position than the general one, one base 3′ from anticodon region, were also predicted in both genomes. This data led to two questions: (i) Are these introns isolated in archaeal tRNA genes actually cleaved out during tRNA processing in living cells? (ii) Are the all intron regions in tRNA genes, including those located at other position than one base 3′ from anticodon region, correctly recognized by the tRNA–intron splicing machinery in archaeal living cells?  In this study, to determine whether all tRNA molecules predicted were expressed, whether the intron regions predicted were actually processed in archaeal living cells and the mechanism for tRNA–intron splicing in Archaea, A. pernix K1 was selected as a target. The reasons why this archaeon was selected are shown in the following: (i) the entire genomic sequence was already determined 14 ; (ii) 14 tRNA genes were identified as interrupted tRNA genes in this genome; (iii) tRNA genes that contain the long intron or the introns within anticodon loop and anticodon stem were predicted and (iv) this microorganism can be easily cultured in aerobic conditions. The cDNA molecules were synthesized from tRNA molecules of this Crenarchaeon by RT–PCR using the specific primers designed from the genomic data.  The plasmid clones containing the cDNA fragments were used for determination of the nucleotide sequences of the mature and premature types of the cDNA molecules. A comparison between these two types of sequences indicated that the introns predicted in tRNA genes of A. pernix K1 were actually processed in living cells and that the bulge–helix–bulge motif was required for recognition of exon–intron boundaries and cleavage of the intron region in A. pernix K1 living cells. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bacterial strains and vector The A. pernix strain K1, deposited in the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM number 9820), was cultured using JXT medium. 16Escherichia coli TOP10F′ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for cloning and preparation of plasmid DNA. pCR2.1 Vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for the cloning of fragments amplified by PCR. 2.2. Preparation of total RNA and small-sized RNA From A. pernix K1 cells, which were grown to late log phase in 40 ml of JXT medium, 16 a crude total RNA sample was prepared with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The prepared RNA was dissolved in 10 µl of RNase-free water. To remove the contaminated DNA, the total RNA was incubated with 10 U of the RNase-free DNase I (Worthington biochemical, Lakewood, NJ, USA) in 50 µl of the reaction buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 ] at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, purified RNA was treated by an equal volume of phenol chloroform solution and precipitated with ethanol. The recovered RNA molecules were dissolved in 10 µl of RNase-free water and stored at −80°C. A mixture of small-sized RNA, including the crude tRNA and 5S RNA, was prepared from 40 µg of total RNA by fractionation with the QIAGEN RNA/DNA Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction.2.3. Preparation of the beads covalently binding the sequence-specific DNA molecules To enrich the less abundant tRNA molecules, the specific tRNA molecules were purified by affinity chromatography. Magnetic beads covalently binding the poly(dT) oligo nucleotide were used as the starting materials. Since the nucleotide sequence of the 3′ half of tRNA Ser (CGA) and tRNA Ser (UGA) were initially same, two 40mer oligo nucleotides, which contained the 3′ half of tRNA Trp (CCA) and tRNA Ser (CGA) or tRNA Ser (UGA), with a 10 nt long poly(dA) sequences at the 3′ end of this oligo DNA were synthesized. The sequences of the synthesized DNA are GACCCGTAGGTCGGGGGTTCAAATCCCCCCGGGCCCACCAAAAAAAAAAA for tRNA Trp (CCA), and CGCGAGGGGCGCGCGGGTTCGAATCCCGCCCCCGGCGCCAAAAAAAAAAA for tRNA Ser (CGA) and tRNA Ser (UGA).  For construction of the matrix for affinity chromatography, 10 µg of synthesized oligo nucleotides were heated at 94°C for 3 min with 15 µl of the Oligotex™-MAG (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) in 50 µl of the kit's 2× binding buffer. After treatment, the solution was slowly cooled to room temperature and the Oligotex™-MAG beads were washed with 350 µl of the kit's wash solution to remove any non-hybridized oligo DNA. For synthesis of the DNA strands complimentary to the oligo DNA on the beads, the Oligotex™-MAG beads with hybridized oligo DNA were incubated in 80 µl of klenow DNA polymerase buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 7 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM DTT and 0.125 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP] at 37°C for 30 min with 12 U of klenow DNA polymerase. After incubation, the Oligotex™-MAG beads in the solution were heated at 94°C for 2 min and quickly chilled. The resulting magnetic beads covalently bind the tRNA-specific DNA strand, and hence were used for affinity concentration of the less-abundant tRNA molecules from small-sized tRNA. 2.4. Purification of the species-specific tRNA moleculesSmall-sized RNA (0.5 µg) was incubated at 94°C for 3 min with the Oligotex™-MAG beads prepared as above in 50 µl of 2× binding buffer used in the Oligotex™-MAG kit. After heating, the solution was incubated at 25°C for 10 min. The non-hybridized tRNA molecules were removed by washing twice with 350 µl of the kit's wash buffer. The species-specific tRNA molecules were recovered in 20 µl of RNase-free pure water by heating at 94°C for 2 min and quickly chilled in ice water. Recovered species-specific concentrated tRNA molecules were stored at −80°C and used for the synthesis of species-specific cDNA.2.5. RT–PCR Synthesis and amplification of cDNA for specific tRNA molecules were carried out by the Thermoscript™ RT–PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the supplier's instruction with some modification. One microgram of total RNA, 1 µg of small-sized RNA or 0.05 µg of species-specific concentrated RNA and 10 pmol of primer were incubated at 95°C for 5 min in 19 µl of Thermoscript™ RT–PCR buffer [50 mM Tris–acetate (pH 8.4), 75 mM potassium acetate, 8 mM magnesium acetate, stabilizer, 5 mM DTT, 40 U RNaseOUT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP] and cooled to the Tm of each primer set used. After cooling to this temperature, 15 U ThermoscriptRT enzyme was added and the reaction mixture was kept at this temperature for 30 min to allow synthesis of the first strand of cDNA.  The subsequent PCR amplification was performed in 50 µl of reaction mixture containing 2 µl of solution from the first reaction, 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP, 10 pmol of the appropriate primer set (as detailed in Tables 1 and 2 ) and 2 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR was performed under standard conditions as specified in the manual accompanying the Thermoscript™ RT–PCR kit. After purification of the amplified fragments by 3% Nusive GTG agarose (FMC, Rockland, MD, USA) gel electrophoresis, the fragments were dissolved in the 10 µl of RNase-free water and stored in −20°C.

Cloning of cDNA For cloning the cDNA fragments amplified, 2 µl of cDNA molecules purified were incubated in 10 µl of reaction solution at 14°C by Original TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 0.05 µg of pCR2.1 Vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For transformation of the ligated DNA, the DNA was introduced into the E. coli TOP10F′ competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 2.7. Sequencing The plasmid DNA was prepared from E. coli cells, which were cultured in 1.2 ml of liquid Luria–Bertani broth at 37°C for 18 h, by QIAprep turbo Miniprep KIT (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The sequencing reaction was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI, Foster city, CA, USA), according to the supplier manual and the signal was detected using BASE station (MJ research, Waltham, MA, USA). 3. Results3.1. RNA molecules prepared As shown in Materials and Methods section, three different qualities of RNA molecules, total RNA, small RNA and species-specific concentrated tRNA molecules, were prepared from freshly cultured cells of A. pernix K1.  Approximately 120 µg of the total RNA molecule was recovered from A. pernix K1 cells cultured in 40 ml culture broth. Approximately 1.8 µg of small RNA was recovered using the QIAGEN RNA/DNA Kit from 40 µg of DNase-treated total RNA. From 0.5 µg of small RNA, all species-specific concentrated tRNA molecules for tRNA Trp (CCA), tRNA Ser (CGA) and tRNA Ser (UGA) were used for the cDNA synthesis. 3.2. Design of primersThe experiment in this report was designed to utilize the specific primers, each of which possessed the sequence identical to corresponding tRNA molecule. The specific primers were capable of annealing only to the specific sequence of the tRNA molecules. For amplification and cloning of the specific cDNA from tRNA molecules, selection of length and sequence of the primer was thought to be important. For the design of the primers utilized for the synthesis of the first strand of the cDNA from the 47 species of tRNA molecules assigned from the genomic sequence, 14 the 3′ end sequences of the tRNA genes were compared with each other. As some identical 3′ end sequences were recognized, 21 independent 18mer oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized. As indicated in Table 1 (column A), these synthesized oligo DNAs were referred as cP plus a two-digit number.  To amplify the cDNA molecules synthesized as the first strand of cDNA from the tRNA molecules, the primers, named aP plus a two-digit number, were designed and synthesized according to the 5′ end sequence of tRNA genes predicted. As listed in Table 1 (column B), 21 independent 18mer oligonucleotides were synthesized, because of the presence of the identical 5′ sequences. PCR with 27 different combinations of cP and aP primers, as listed in Table 2 , were planned for amplification of all 47 tRNA molecules present in A. pernix . 3.3. Detection of amplified fragments During synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, the RNA template and cP-type primer was not chilled below the Tm of the primer used, to minimize the non-specific annealing of primers to the unrelated region or unrelated RNA molecules. After heat treatment, at 95°C for 5 min, of a reaction solution containing both the RNA and cP-type primer, the solution was cooled only to the annealing temperature and this temperature was maintained until addition of reverse transcriptase. Among 27 RT–PCRs with the total RNA, all the amplified cDNA products were detected except for reaction by primer set 8. The cDNA fragments synthesized from the total RNA by 26 primer sets were used for construction of independent libraries by cloning into pCR2.1 vector. Each library constructed was designated as the APcDNAT plus number of primer set. Since some cDNA fragments which were expected to be involved in the libraries APcDNAT08, 15, 20, 22 and 27 were not recovered, RT–PCRs and library construction were performed with the small RNA to obtain the cDNAs not identified from the total RNA. By this reaction, the four libraries, referred as the APcDNAS plus number of primer set, were constructed with products amplified by the primer set 15, 20, 22 and 27, but a fragment was not amplified by the primer set 8. Although the plasmid clones made from mature form of tRNA Tyr (GUA), tRNA Ser (GGA) and tRNA Phe (GAA) were identified from the APcDNAS libraries, cDNA fragments for mature forms of tRNA Trp (CCA) and tRNA Ser (CGA) and tRNA Ser (UGA) were still not obtained from this type of libraries.  To obtain the cDNA fragments synthesized from the mature forms of tRNA Trp (CCA) and tRNA Ser (CGA) and tRNA Ser (UGA), affinity chromatography was performed to separate and concentrate these three specific tRNA molecules. The cDNA clone for the mature form of tRNA Trp (CCA) was identified in the library constructed from species-specific concentrated tRNA molecules. However, cDNA fragments for mature form of tRNA Ser (CGA) and tRNA Ser (UGA) were not detected in the libraries constructed from this concentrated RNA. 3.4. Identification of tRNA molecules without introns by sequence determination The cDNA libraries APcDNAT02, 04, 05, 06, 07, 09, 10 and 12 contained only one uninterrupted cDNA species as shown in Table 2 . To confirm these tRNA molecules, five plasmid clones, each of one library, were randomly selected and used for determination of the nucleotide sequence of the insert portion. Sequencing results indicated that these eight tRNA genes actually produced the tRNA molecules identical to the prediction.  Since the cDNA libraries APcDNAT01, 03, 11, 13 and 14 contained the multiple tRNA molecules transcribed from the uninterrupted tRNA genes, 30, 40, 20, 20 and 20 plasmid DNAs used for determination of sequence were prepared from the cDNA libraries APcDNAT01, 03, 11, 13 and 14, respectively. Sequencing results indicated that all 13 uninterrupted tRNA molecules recognized by these five primer sets were actually present in the living A. pernix cells, and that the sequence of the tRNA molecules actually present in the living A. pernix cells were identical to previous prediction of these tRNA genes.  The sequencing results for clones from APcDNAT01 to 07 and from APcDNA09 to 14 indicated that the nucleotide sequences of the 21 tRNA molecules actually produced from the uninterrupted tRNA genes in A. pernix were identical to those predicted in the previous genomic paper. 14 Each library APcDNAT16, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 27 contained two or more cDNA clones corresponding to the premature and mature forms of tRNA molecules, because these primer sets were specific to both the intron-containing and uncontaining tRNA genes. Thus, 80, 60, 40, 60, 60 and 40 clones randomly selected were used for determination of the sequence of insert portion of clones in libraries APcDNAT16, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 27, respectively. Sequencing results indicated that among 11 tRNA molecules expected to be included in these libraries, 8 cDNA clones for uninterrupted molecules for tRNA Val (CAC), tRNA Val (UAC), tRNA Val (GAC), tRNA Ser (GCU), tRNA Arg (GCG), tRNA Arg (CCU), tRNA Gly (CCC) and tRNA Gly (UCC), were identified in these APcDNAT type of libraries. The APcDNAS libraries were constructed with cDNA synthesized from the small RNA with primer set 20 and 27, to obtain the remaining cDNAs for three uninterrupted tRNA molecules. Sequencing results showed that the cDNA clones for tRNA Ser (GGA) and tRNA Phe (GAA) were identified from the APcDNAS libraries.  In the libraries constructed from the total or small RNA, totally 31 cDNA clones corresponding to the tRNA molecules produced from the uninterrupted tRNA genes were identified. Although cDNA clones for tRNA Ser (UGA) and tRNA Thr (UGU-2) were not detected in any libraries, the over all results revealed that previous prediction of the uninterrupted tRNA genes was accurate. 3.5. Confirmation of actual intron positionTo determine the actual splicing patterns of tRNA molecules transcribed from each interrupted tRNA gene, sequence comparison of the premature form with mature form of the tRNA molecules transcribed from same interrupted tRNA gene was performed. As the length of the cDNA synthesized from premature form of tRNA molecules was longer than those from mature form of tRNA molecules, five longer clones, each of one library, APcDNAT15 to 27, were used for the determination of their sequences for the premature form. The cloning and sequencing results indicated that all premature forms of tRNA molecules transcribed from the interrupted tRNA genes were identified from the APcDNAT library except for tRNA Thr (CGU), which was still not identified from APcDNAS library. These results are summarized in Table 3 .

Numbers in bold indicate the intron locations different against prediction.tRNAs underlined indicate those or the intron of those predicted manually.Summary of introns detected and unidentified tRNA moleculest indicates ‘isolated from total RNA’; s indicates ‘isolated from small RNA’; c indicates ‘isolated from species-specific concentrated RNA’; n. d. indicates ‘not detected’ and n. a. indicates ‘not assigned’. a Intron position was indicated the nucleotides distance from 5′ end of the gene. b tRNA Met (CAU-1) was originally designated as APEtRNA07; tRNA Met (CAU-2) was originally designated as APEtRNA16. c tRNA Thr (UGU-1) was originally designated as APEtRNA06; tRNA Thr (UGU-2) was originally designated as APEtRNA26. Numbers in bold indicate the intron locations different against prediction.tRNAs underlined indicate those or the intron of those predicted manually. Since the primer sets 15, 17, 18, 19, 25 and 26 were able to recognize only one interrupted tRNA gene, it was thought that each library, APcDNAT15, 17, 18, 19, 25 and 26, contained only two different-sized cDNA clones made from the premature and mature forms of tRNA molecules. Each of the five plasmids with the short and long insert were selected from each library and used for sequencing analyses. All cDNA clones corresponding to the mature form of these interrupted tRNA molecules were successfully identified from these six libraries. The cDNA clone for the mature form of the tRNA Thr (CGU) molecule was identified from the APcDNAT library, but that for the premature form of tRNA Thr (CGU) was not identified from the APcDNAT or APcDNAS libraries.  As the APcDNAT22 library contained cDNAs corresponding to the two interrupted tRNA genes, tRNA Trp (CCA) and tRNA Met (CAU-2), each of the 30 clones for the shorter and longer clones from the library were used for the determination of the sequence. The sequencing results indicated that both tRNA Met (CAU-2) molecules were present in A. pernix , but the evidence for the maturation of tRNA Trp (CCA) was not obtained from APcDNAT22 library. Then, the library APcDNAS22 was constructed from the small RNA, but the cDNA clone corresponding to the mature form of tRNA Trp (CCA) was not identified in this library.  The libraries APcDNAT16, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 27 contained the multiple cDNAs synthesized with primer sets specific to both the interrupted and uninterrupted tRNA genes. The length of the cDNA fragment was confirmed by PCR analyses of insert portion, and 60–100 independent plasmid clones with short insert were used for the determination of sequence. All shorter cDNA clones were detected in these sequenced clones in APcDNAT libraries except for the APcDNAT20 and 27 libraries. Two cDNA libraries, APcDNAS20 and 27, were constructed to obtain these missing cDNA clones in the libraries APcDNAT20 and APcDNAT27. The cDNA clones corresponding to the uninterrupted tRNA molecules, tRNA Ser (GGA) and tRNA Phe (GAA), and mature form of tRNA Tyr (GUA) were identified from the APcDNAS libraries. However, two cDNA clones corresponding to the mature form of tRNA Ser (CGA) and the tRNA Ser (UGA) molecule were still not identified from the APcDNAS library.  As the cDNAs for two mature forms of the tRNA molecules, tRNA Trp (CCA) and tRNA Ser (CGA), were not identified from the APcDNAS library, the concentration of species-specific tRNA molecules for tRNA Trp (CCA) and tRNA Ser (CGA) were performed as described in Materials and Methods section. In the libraries constructed from the species-specific concentrated tRNA molecules, the mature form of tRNA Trp (CCA) was identified, but cDNA for tRNA Ser (CGA) was not obtained.  Among 14 interrupted tRNA genes, 12 sets of both the premature and mature forms, 1 mature form and 1 premature form of cDNA, were identified as indicated in Table 3 . These results indicated that the tRNA molecules, that were actually transcribed from the interrupted tRNA genes predicted, were actually processed in A. pernix K1 living cells. Since the mature form of tRNA Thr (CGU) molecule was cloned and sequenced, sequence comparison data of this clone and 12 sets of both forms of tRNA molecules provided the information for actual splicing position.  In the previous genomic paper of A. pernix K1, 14 the intron region of tRNA Trp (CCA), tRNA Thr (UGU-1) and tRNA Asp (GUC) were manually predicted to locate at three bases 5′ from the anticodon, within the D-loop and at one base 3′ from anticodon with the 121 bp long intron, which was 1.5 times longer than the tRNA molecule itself, respectively. The comparison of cDNA sequences corresponding to the mature and premature forms of these tRNA molecules indicated that the intron region predicted in these tRNA genes were actually processed in A. pernix K1 cells.  However, 36 nt long introns in the tRNA Lys (CUU) and the tRNA Lys (UUU) were identified at 8 bases 3′ from the anticodon region as shown in bold in Table 3 . Also, the 44 nt long intron in the tRNA Pro (CGG) was identified at one base 5′ from the anticodon region. Totally, five interrupted tRNA genes in A. pernix contained the intron portion at other position than one base 3′ from anticodon and other eight tRNA introns, including the 121 bp long intron in tRNA Asp (GUC), were inserted into the position at one base 3′ from anticodon, which is common to the eukaryotic tRNA intron. 4. Discussion Our work was able to show both the actual transcription of the tRNA molecules and the actual processing of tRNA–intron portions by cloning a whole set of cDNA for tRNA molecules in A. pernix living cells. This is one of the first cases of identification of a whole set of tRNA molecules present in one organism as cDNA, including the premature and mature forms of tRNA molecules.  Our success in cloning cDNA clones for most of tRNA molecules was mainly due to the improvement of the methods used for synthesis of the first strand of cDNA from RNA molecules. In our work, the solution containing both template RNA and primer was not chilled below the Tm of the primers, which should allow primers to anneal to specific sites of tRNA molecules only. It is noteworthy that the annealing temperature of primers and RNA template is important for synthesis and amplification of specific cDNA from similar molecules such as tRNA.  In this work, four tRNA molecules, tRNA Thr (UGU-2), tRNA Ser (UGA), mature form of tRNA Ser (CGA) and premature form of tRNA Thr (CGU), were not identified as cDNA molecules from any qualities of RNA. The mature form of tRNA Tyr (GUA), tRNA Ser (GGA) and tRNA Phe (GAA) were isolated from small RNA molecules. The cDNA for the mature form of tRNA Trp (CCA) was successfully cloned from the species-specific tRNA molecules concentrated by the affinity chromatography technique, indicating that affinity chromatography was effective for concentration of the species-specific tRNA molecules. These results revealed that the concentration of one kind of tRNA molecule and usage of small RNA were effective for the cloning of relatively rare tRNA molecules.  The insertion position and length of the introns identified in the tRNA Lys (CUU) and tRNA Lys (UUU) genes were identical. And it was shown that these two tRNA genes shared the same sequence except for 2 nt, even though the different length and sequences of the intron portions were confirmed in other tRNA genes. In the genomic data of the two methanogen, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii17 and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus , 18 the tRNA Lys (CUU) gene was not present. These facts proposed one hypothesis that the two introns identified in the tRNA Lys (CUU) and tRNA Lys (UUU) genes were derived from the same origin. It can be thought that the intron was introduced into the tRNA Lys (UUU) gene before duplication or separation of the tRNA Lys (CUU) gene, then the tRNA Lys (CUU) was duplicated or separated from tRNA Lys (UUU) recently in A. pernix , accompanied with the transfer of the same intron to the tRNA Lys (CUU).  According to the tRNA Thr (UGU-2), it was thought that this tRNA gene was overestimated by tRNA detection software. The reason for this conclusion is due to the facts that cDNA for tRNA Thr (UGU-2) was not amplified even when specific primer set 8 was used, the promoter motif sequence was not identified at upstream of the tRNA Thr (UGU-2) gene (shown below), both the premature and mature products from the tRNA gene for threonine with same anticodon, tRNA Thr (UGU-1), were identified and the score for this tRNA gene indicated by tRNA detection software was lower than those for other tRNA genes.  The previous analyses proposed two types of mechanisms for the splicing of the intron region in tRNA molecule. One is the eukaryotic type, in which the intron region in the tRNA molecule was recognized by the distance from the top of the anticodon stem to the 5′ and 3′ cleavage sites as shown in Fig. 2A4 , 5 and cleavage of the eukaryotic intron requires the formation of a 3 nt bulge loop at the 3′ intron–exon boundary site. 19 This mechanism is well suited for the fact that all eukaryal tRNA introns are located in one base 3′ from anticodon.  The other is the archaeal type of splicing mechanism of tRNA intron. In contrast with the eukaryotic type, studies for archaeal tRNA intron showed that complete mature tRNA structure was not required for digestion of intron by intron endonuclease. 6 , 7 Cleavage of the archaeal tRNA introns requires a structural motif element at the exon–intron boundaries, the bulge–helix–bulge motif structure as shown in Fig. 2B . 7 Since the tRNA introns in A. pernix were confirmed at six different positions, the distance between the top of the anticodon stem and cleavage sites was widely variable. Hence, we searched the bulge–helix–bulge motif structures at the exon–intron boundaries confirmed in this work.  For the eight interrupted tRNA genes, of which introns were confirmed to locate at one base 3′ from anticodon, the bulge–helix–bulge motif structures were detected at the exon–intron boundaries as shown in Fig. 3 .

The same bulge–helix–bulge motif structures were searched on the two genes for tRNA Thr (UGU-1) and tRNA Trp (CCA), their actual processing occurred at the D stem and the anticodon stem which were at the same position as predicted, respectively. The bulge–helix–bulge motif structures were clearly recognized at the confirmed exon–intron boundaries of these tRNA genes as shown in Fig. 4 , even though those introns were identified at the D stem and the anticodon stem.

For the three tRNA genes encoding tRNA Lys (CUU), tRNA Lys (UUU) and tRNA Pro (CGG), of which the actual cleavage site were differed from that predicted by software, we compared the structures at the exon–intron boundaries confirmed in this work with those found surround the exon–intron boundaries predicted. Figure 5A–C indicates the structures of premature forms of tRNA molecules including introns at the position predicted by software and Fig. 5D–F indicates those including introns at the confirmed insertion position. Figure 5A–C showed that the bulge–helix–bulge motif structure was not recognized at the exon–intron boundary. However, the bulge–helix–bulge motif structure was clearly identified at the exon–intron boundary confirmed by this work, as shown in Fig. 5D–F .

These results indicate that the bulge–helix–bulge motif structure plays a most important role for recognition and cleavage of intron region in the tRNA genes in A. pernix . This fact indicates that the intron in the tRNA molecules is cleaved by the mechanism generally used in Archaea. Marck and Grosjean 20 reported that the clear bulge–helix–bulge motif structure was not recognized at the intron–exon boundary in some archaeal-interrupted tRNA genes. However, our results indicate that clear bulge–helix–bulge motif structure is necessary for correct recognition and cleavage of the intron region in archaeal tRNA genes, and that the data for insertion position of the intron used in analyses by Marck and Grosjean 20 might not be accurate, because of the absence of experimental confirmation for those data. Also it is noteworthy that a feature such as the bulge–helix–bulge motif structure conserved at exon–intron boundaries in archaeal tRNA genes must be introduced for computational prediction of the correct intron position in archaeal tRNA genes.  In both the rRNA genes of A. pernix K1, the intron sequences were previously identified. 21 The structure at the exon–intron boundary in these rRNA genes was predicted as the bulge–helix–bulge motif structure similar to those recognized at the exon–intron boundary in the tRNA molecules. Watanabe et al. 22 indicated the evidence that an intron-containing protein-coding gene, APE0989 and APE0990, was present in A. pernix K1. The exon–intron boundary sequence of this protein-coding gene, which encodes a subunit of a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein involved in eukaryotic rRNA, indicated the typical bulge–helix–bulge motif structure. The structural similarity of intron boundary sequences in archaeal genes encoding tRNA, rRNA and protein suggests the hypothesis that the introns of archaeal tRNA gene transfered to rRNA genes and protein-coding genes. If so, it can be thought that the intron region in archaeal tRNA gene is the ancestral intron in the protein-coding genes in Eukaryotes.  The tRNA–intron endonucleases identified from archaeal genomic data are classified into two types, the one is over 300 amino acid residues and the other is shorter than 190 residues. This difference in size suggests that these two types of endonucleases will exhibit different functions or mechanisms of cleavage of introns in tRNA molecules. From the genome data of A. pernix K1, the 187 residues long APE1646 protein was identified as a protein similar to the tRNA–intron endonuclease of Haloferax volcanii reported by Kleman-Leyer et al. 23 The tRNA ligase capable of joining exon ends was identified from yeast, 24 but not detected in halophiles. 7 We searched for this ligase in the genomic information of A. pernix K1. However, an ORF encoding the related enzyme was not detected as similar to the other Archaea. This ligase would be necessary for the joining of two exons cleaved by the tRNA endonuclease. Hence, identification and characterization of this ligase is the next important step for understanding the mechanism of tRNA splicing in Archaea.  The first prediction of tRNA genes in A. pernix K1 was performed by tRNAscan, which was developed by Lowe and Eddy, 25 as described in the previous genomic paper. Forty-five tRNA genes were predicted by this software, and two genes, tRNA Asp (GUC) and tRNA Trp (CCA), were predicted manually. The intron in tRNA Thr (UGU-1) and tRNA Trp (CCA) genes were manually predicted within the D stem, regions which were not detected by tRNAscan as intron, and at three bases 5′ from anticodon, respectively. The intron location of the other 12 interrupted tRNA genes was predicted at one base 3′ from anticodon in the tRNA gene. According to the 33 uninterrupted tRNA genes, 31 tRNA molecules transcribed were confirmed in this work as same molecules as prediction. This result indicated the reliability of the assignment of the uninterrupted tRNA genes by tRNAscan. In contrast, the result for confirmation of transcript from the interrupted tRNA genes predicted by tRNAscan was not in the same situation. Among 14 interrupted tRNA genes, the correct position of the intron portion in tRNA Ser (CGA) was not confirmed by this experiment, because of the failure of obtaining the mature type of its cDNA. The actual location of the intron for the remaining 13 interrupted tRNA genes were confirmed in this work, as both the premature and mature forms of cDNA molecules for 12 interrupted tRNA genes and the mature form of cDNA molecule for the tRNA Thr (CGU) were identified. A comparison of the mature sequence with the premature sequence of cDNA molecules indicated that transcripts from seven tRNA genes, tRNA Arg (UCU), tRNA Cys (GCA), tRNA Met (CAU-1), tRNA Met (CAU-2), tRNA Pro (GGG), tRNA Tyr (GUA) and tRNA Thr (CGU), were spliced at the exon–intron boundary predicted by software. However, the introns in six tRNA genes, shown in bold and underlined in Table 3 , were processed at the other positions than those predicted by software. The ratio of correct assignment of the intron position is only 54%. This result shows that tRNAscan is reliable for assignment of the uninterrupted tRNA genes, but not reliable for assignment of the interrupted tRNA genes in A. pernix K1.  The tRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, which recognizes the promoter sequence located in the coding part of the tRNA genes in Eukaryotes and that located upstream from the transcription start point in prokaryotic tRNA genes. The two distinct recognition boxes, 11 bp long A box: TRRYNNARYGG and B box: GGTTCGANTCC, were identified in the coding part of the Eukaryotic tRNA genes, 26 and similar sequences were also detected upstream of prokaryotic tRNA genes. 27 These boxed sequences were searched in the coding and upstream region of the tRNA genes of A. pernix K1, but no identical or related boxed sequence was identified. Instead of the absence of the known boxed sequences, the novel consensus motif sequences were identified in the upstream region of the tRNA genes. The consensus motif sequences identified and the original sequences of the upstream region of tRNA genes are summarized in Table 4 .

The consensus motif sequence identified consisted of three independent consensus elements, motif A is poly-purines, motif B is RRTA and motif C is SRGG, and each consensus motif was separated by the spacer sequences with different length. The consensus motif sequences were not identified at the upstream region of the tRNA Thr (UGU-2) gene, which supported the suggestion that this region was not worked as tRNA gene.  Three tRNA gene clusters, tRNA Met (CAU-1)-tRNA Thr (UGU-1), tRNA Ser (CGA)-tRNA Pro (UGG) and tRNA Cys (GCA)-tRNA Glu (UUC), were predicted to be transcribed as a single transcript. The promoter motif sequences were identified at the upstream region of the gene clusters, but conservation of the promoter motif sequences was not clearly identified at the upstream region of the downstream genes. As the tRNA Pro (UGG) gene was located downstream of the tRNA Ser (CGA) gene with a distance of just 7 nt, the cDNA for tRNA Pro (UGG) and premature form of tRNA Ser (CGA) were obtained from the total RNA. However, the cDNA for the mature form of tRNA Ser (CGA) was not obtained, suggesting that splicing of the premature form of the tRNA Ser (CGA) molecule should not have efficiently occurred.  Our study emphasizes that genomic information is a powerful source from which is investigated the analyses of a family of molecules or reactions in one organism. Our results provide the opportunity for future research on the more detailed understanding of a variety of biological events in Archaea. Since the tRNA ligase was not identified from Archaea, it is necessary to identify the tRNA ligase from Archaea, which also provides the information for recognition mechanism of the exon portion and construction mechanism of the mature tRNA molecules. As three tRNA gene clusters were identified in A. pernix , it is also targeted to understand the actual cleavage mechanism of the transcript from the cluster tRNA genes into each independent tRNA molecule in Archaea cell. Since the similar intron portion was identified in the tRNA, rRNA and protein-coding genes in A. pernix , this microorganism is thought to be one of the most convenient materials for understanding the mechanism for evolution of intron region and the machinery utilized in A. pernix for processing the independent but similar intron portion possessed in the different types of genes.

Introduction Introns are non-coding sequences in a gene that are transcribed but spliced out of the precursor mRNA. 1 , 2 Introns are widespread and abundant in eukaryotic genomes. 3 , 4 For example, introns constitute ∼11 and 24% of the fruit fly 5 and human 6 genomes, respectively. Generally speaking, introns have little functional significance, although some introns may influence the level of gene expression. 7 Therefore, introns are more variable than coding sequences.  Variations or polymorphisms in DNA sequences can be exploited as genetic markers (usually called molecular markers), which are very useful tools for genetic research (e.g. construction of genetic maps, mapping of genes or quantitative trait loci) and breeding (e.g. marker-assisted selection). Botstein et al. 8 first utilized restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) as genetic markers to construct human genetic map. Since then, many new molecular markers have been developed, such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), 9 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), 10 microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR), 11 , 12 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) 13 and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). 14 Intron polymorphisms can also be exploited as genetic markers. They have been successfully utilized in population genetics surveys 15–17 and gene mapping. 18 There could be various polymorphisms in introns, but intron length polymorphism (ILP) is the most easily recognizable type. It can be conveniently detected by the PCR. To amplify introns by PCR, primers can be designed in flanking exons. This approach is called exon-primed intron-crossing PCR (EPIC-PCR). 19 The advantage of EPIC-PCR is that exon sequences are relatively more conservative and therefore the primers designed in exons may have more extensive applications than those designed in non-coding sequences. Using this approach, Bierne et al. 20 developed several ILP markers in penaeid shrimps. To date, however, studies of exploiting intron polymorphism markers have been restricted to a few genes. No efforts on genome-wide exploitation of intron polymorphism markers have been reported.  In rice ( Oryza sativa ), draft genome sequences of two cultivars, 93-11 21 and Nipponbare, 22 representing indica and japonica subspecies, respectively, and a set of over 28 000 full-length cDNA sequences from Nipponbare 23 have been released. Moreover, complete sequences of chromosomes 1, 4 and 10 and, more recently, the whole genome of Nipponbare have been published. 24–27 In addition, a tentative assembly of all chromosomes of rice has been released (The Institute of Genomic Research, TIGR; Author Webpage ). These data provide us with an opportunity to systematically search for DNA polymorphisms between the two subspecies and to exploit DNA markers on a large scale in rice. Recently, Shen et al. 28 and Feltus et al. 29 independently conducted genome-wide investigations of SNPs and InDels or single-base InDels using the same set of released genome drafts of 93-11 and Nipponbare. However, it is astonishing that while Shen et al. 28 identified 1 703 176 SNPs and 479 406 InDels, among which there were 277 858 single-base InDels according to our count from their online database, Feltus et al. 29 only identified 384 341 SNPs and 24 557 single-base InDels—the numbers of SNPs and single-base InDels identified by Shen et al. 28 are 4.4 and 11.3 times greater than those identified by Feltus et al. 29 respectively. The great inconsistency between the two studies suggests that there might be many mistakes in the reported SNPs and InDels. ILPs are caused by InDels, but many of them cannot be simply considered equivalent to the generally defined InDels because an ILP may contain several (instead of only one) InDels. In addition, even if we take all ILPs as InDels, they are at least a special subset of InDels exhibiting polymorphisms in the non-coding regions of genes. This may make ILPs possess special characteristics and usefulness. In the work described here, we performed a genome-wide search for ILPs and a large-scale exploitation of candidate ILP markers via electronic EPIC-PCR based on the released genomic and cDNA sequence data in rice. We also developed a set of ILP markers selected from the candidates and investigated their characteristics by experiment. Moreover, we established a web-accessible database for rice ILP markers.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Data sources of rice genomic and cDNA sequences We downloaded genomic sequence data of two rice cultivars, Nipponbare (ssp. japonica ) and 93-11 (ssp. indica ), released by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) and Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), from web sites Author Webpage and Author Webpage , respectively. In addition, we downloaded 32 127 full-length cDNA sequences of Nipponbare from web site Author Webpage . 2.2. Search of ILPs We developed a pipeline using Perl script to search ILPs between Nipponbare and 93-11 and exploit candidate ILP markers. The initial step was to identify the most likely positions of the available cDNA sequences in rice genome by aligning the cDNA sequences of Nipponbare with the genomic sequences of Nipponbare and 93-11 using BLASTN. 30 We used a high E -value (= 10 −20 ) for the BLASTN to remove paralogues. Then we used the program SIM4 31 to align each cDNA with its corresponding BAC clone from Nipponbare and Scaffold from 93-11 to examine the gene structure (number of introns and positions of splice sites) and putative ILPs between the two cultivars in the gene. Although there could be several possible types of ILPs, we restricted our ILP search to those genes that showed the same structure (i.e. same number of introns with same positions of splice sites) in the two cultivars because ILPs in those genes could potentially be exploited as PCR-based codominant markers. 2.3. Exploitation of candidate ILP markers by electronic EPIC-PCR To exploit ILP markers from the putative ILPs identified by BLASTN and SIM4, we designed PCR primers based on the cDNA sequences (of Nipponbare) corresponding to the flanking exons using ePrime3 ( Author Webpage ). 32 For convenience, we used a 200 bp cDNA sequence with 100 bp on each side of the target intron for the primer design for each ILP. A simulation study conducted beforehand had shown that the cDNA length could guarantee 93% success in primer design. Then we tested the designed primers by electronic PCR (e-PCR) 33 on the genomic sequences of Nipponbare and 93-11, respectively. To increase the quality and usability of the in silico exploited ILP markers, we required exact matches between primers and templates and set a 1100 bp margin on the product size for the e-PCR. We took a putative ILP locus as a candidate ILP marker when it was successfully and uniquely detected by the e-PCR and named it with the abbreviation RI (for Rice ILP) followed by a unique number (e.g. RI03281). 2.4. Verification and evaluation of ILP markers by experiment We selected 215 candidate ILP markers for the experimental evaluation. According to the RGP's rice genetic map, 34 the selected candidate ILP markers were approximately evenly distributed in rice genome with an average of ∼8 cM between adjacent ILP loci. While we directly adopted the PCR primers designed in flanking exons for most of the selected candidate ILP markers, we also redesigned primers in introns for some with smaller intron length difference (ILD) but larger intron size in order that polymorphisms could be detected via electrophoresis. All primers were synthesized by either Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering & Technology Company or Shanghai BioAsia Biotechnology Company.  We tested the synthesized primers at first using Nipponbare, 93-11 and their F 1 . We extracted genomic DNAs from young leaves using CTAB method 35 with modification. We conducted PCR in a 15 µl reaction mixture containing 50 ng template DNA, 0.5 µM of each primer, 200 µM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 U Taq polymerase and 1.5 µl of 10× PCR buffer. We first tested all primer pairs with a touchdown PCR (Td-PCR) 36 program: 5 min at 94°C; 10 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 59°C minus 0.3°C/cycle, 1 min at 72°C; 20 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, 1 min at 72°C; and 5 min at 72°C for final extension. For primer pairs that did not generate good amplification results, we adjusted the initial annealing temperature (59°C) to 60 or 57°C. The purpose of using Td-PCR was to increase the specificity of amplification, but some primer pairs only required a routine PCR program: 5 min at 94°C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 54°C, and 1 min at 72°C; and 5 min at 72°C for final extension. For most primers, we used 6% non-denaturing PAGE (250 V, 2 h) for separating PCR products and silver staining for visualizing DNA bands following Xu et al. 37 with modification. We also used 2% agarose gel for some primers.  For primers generating correct PCR products as expected, we further tested them using 10 rice varieties including Nipponbare and 93-11 ( Table 1 ), which were kindly provided by the China National Rice Research Institute (CNRRI). Based on the PCR data, we evaluated the allelic diversity of each ILP marker using the polymorphism information content (PIC) value defined as PICi=1−∑j=1npij2 , where  p ij is the frequency of the j th pattern for the i th marker. 38Rice accessions used for testing ILP markersa Might not be typical indica or japonica according to its pedigree. Rice accessions used for testing ILP markersa Might not be typical indica or japonica according to its pedigree.  We also employed some of the ILP primers to perform PCR in other plants including five Gramineae plants (wheat, barley, maize, sorghum and bamboo) and three dicot plants (rape, cotton and tobacco), using either a Td-PCR program (with an initial annealing temperature of 55°C) or a routine PCR program (with an annealing temperature of 52°C). 3.

Number, distribution and density of ILPs in rice By aligning 32 127 full-length cDNA sequences from Nipponbare with the genomic sequences of Nipponbare and 93-11 using BLASTN and SIM4, we found 120 489 and 108 312 introns in the two cultivars, respectively, and identified 13 308 putative ILPs between the two cultivars. All the cDNAs were localized to the BAC clones of Nipponbare as expected, but 1279 (3.98%) cDNAs did not align to the scaffolds of 93-11 with an E -value below the BLAST criterion of 10 −20 . That could be the reason that fewer introns were found in 93-11. By referring to the TIGR psuedomolecule assembly of rice, we have plotted the density distribution curve of ILPs in rice genome ( Fig. 1 ). Due to discrepancies between GenBank and TIGR in the assembly of some BAC clones, 32 ILPs could not be assigned to chromosomes and 302 ILPs could not be located, although their chromosomes were known. Therefore, we did not count these ILPs when plotting the density distribution curves, but still took those ILPs into account when calculating the total number and overall density of ILPs on each chromosome ( Fig. 1 ). Most (>100) of the non-located ILPs were in chromosome 10.  Density distribution of ILPs across rice genome. A gray rectangle on each x -axis indicates the position of centromere. The total number and overall density (number per Mb) of ILPs on each chromosome are also presented.  Density distribution of ILPs across rice genome. A gray rectangle on each x -axis indicates the position of centromere. The total number and overall density (number per Mb) of ILPs on each chromosome are also presented.  It is obvious from Fig. 1 that the ILP density fluctuates dramatically along the genome and varies among chromosomes, ranging from 23.04 per Mb (chromosome 12) to 45.31 per Mb (chromosome 2) with an average of 32.52 per Mb; or from 6.25 per cM (chromosome 9) to 11.45 per cM (chromosome 2) with an average of 8.48 per cM. ILPs are clearly not randomly distributed in rice genome. In addition, the number of ILPs on each chromosome also varies greatly, ranging from 584 (chromosome 9) to 1848 (chromosome 3) with an average of 1106 ( Fig. 1 ). The ILPs on chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 together constitute ∼40% of the total number.  Rice genome is estimated to contain 46 022–55 615 genes. 21 In this study, we have found 13 308 ILPs between Nipponbare and 93-11 based on 32 127 full-length cDNA sequences, suggesting that there are 0.414 ILPs per cDNA on average. If we approximately consider a cDNA as a gene, then we can deduce that the total number of ILPs between the two cultivars would be 19 064 to 23 037 according to the estimate obtained in this study. It should be emphasized that we restricted the ILP search to those genes having the same structure (number and positions of introns) in both Nipponbare and 93-11. Therefore, there were some genes not taken into account. In fact, we have mentioned above that 1279 (3.98%) cDNAs did not hit the scaffolds of 93-11 in the BLAST with an E -value below 10 −20 . These genes might either be specific to japonica or have large variation between indica and japonica during evolution. 39 For the former case, all introns in the genes could be taken as ILPs with null alleles in indica and therefore could be potentially exploited as dominant ILP markers. For the latter case, ILPs could also exist. We thus see that ILPs are very rich in the rice genome and should be a huge resource of molecular markers. 3.2. Candidate ILP markers Using primers designed in flanking exons, we successfully obtained e-PCR products from 10 572 (79.4%) and 7742 (58.2%) putative ILP loci in Nipponbare and 93-11, respectively. Although we designed the primers based on the cDNAs from Nipponbare, we failed to acquire e-PCR products from ∼1/5 putative ILP loci in Nipponbare, probably due to the several constraint conditions set for the primer design and e-PCR (see Materials and Methods). There were a higher proportion of putative ILPs in 93-11 not detected by e-PCR because mismatches might occur between some primers and the genomic sequence of 93-11. Although perfect match between primer and template was required in the e-PCR, there still were 1009 primer pairs detecting multiple BAC clones located on different chromosomes and appearing to have multiple copies in Nipponbare. Similarly, 880 primer pairs detected multiple scaffolds and showed multiple copies in 93-11. A typical example was the primer pair designed in cDNA AK064639, which detected a total of 106 occurrences on japonica genome, indicating that the primer pair might be designed in the conserved sequences of a big gene family. As multiple-copy is not desirable for molecular markers, we discarded these primer pairs. It is noted that the 10 572 ILP loci detected by e-PCR in Nipponbare were located only on 2405 (∼61%) BAC clones, leaving 1526 clones without ILP hits. The result also reflects the nonrandom distribution of ILPs in rice genome.  By combining the e-PCR results in Nipponbare and 93-11, we obtained 5811 candidate single-copy ILP markers. The number of candidate ILP markers on each chromosome ranged from 130 (chromosome 9) to 990 (chromosome 2) with an average of 484; and the density on each chromosome ranged from 4.91 per Mb (chromosome 4) to 24.81 per Mb (chromosome 2) with an average of 13.06 per Mb, or from 1.39 per cM (chromosome 9) to 6.27 per cM (chromosome 2) with an average of 3.42 per cM ( Fig. 2 ). Based on the TIGR psuedomolecule assembly of rice, we have constructed a physical map of the 5811 candidate ILP markers and a comparative map of 2275 RFLP and 2740 SSR markers ( Fig. 2 ). The map shows that the candidate ILP markers are not evenly distributed. This seems to be consistent with the distribution of ILPs ( Fig. 1 ). However, it is surprising that some genomic regions (particularly in the long arms of chromosomes 1, 4, 9 and 12) are nearly devoid of candidate ILP markers although the putative ILPs in these regions are not rare ( Fig. 2 ). By examining the distribution of e-PCR hits in the whole genome, we found that these regions appeared to have high frequencies of No-EPCR-Hit-in-93-11 (NEH9) ( Fig. 3 ). This could explain why there were so few candidate ILP markers obtained in these regions. The major reason of NEH9 for a putative ILP locus could be that mismatches occurred between the primers designed based on the cDNA of Nipponbare and the genomic sequence of 93-11. The high frequencies of mismatches in these regions imply that these regions might have a higher level of genetic variation between the two subspecies. To develop ILP markers in these regions, we need to identify conserved sequences of each gene for designing PCR primers.

The horizontal axis shows the pseudomolecule position (Mb); the vertical axis shows the number of NEH9s per Mb. The length difference between allelic introns (referred to as intron length difference, ILD) in the candidate ILP marker loci appeared to follow an exponential distribution with a mean value of 11.42 bp ( Fig. 4 ). Most (72.6%) of the ILDs were <5 bp; 23.5% fell between 5 and 50 bp; and very few (3.9%) were >50 bp. Generally speaking, the larger the ILD is, the easier the detection will be. Therefore, the candidate ILP markers with ILDs ≥ 5 bp should be preferentially considered in practical studies. However, the candidate ILP markers with small ILDs (<5 bp) should not be ignored too, because they are in the majority. The number distribution of intron length difference in 5811 candidate ILP markers.The number distribution of intron length difference in 5811 candidate ILP markers. Since ILPs are detected with specific PCR primers, they usually can be used as STS (sequence-tagging site) markers like SSRs. By examining the intron sequences of the 5811 candidate ILP markers, we found that only 208 (3.58%) of the ILPs were due to SSR variation, of which TA was the most frequent motif (19.2%), followed by GA (14.4%). This means that there is only a very small overlap between ILPs and SSRs in rice. In addition, we have seen that ILPs exist in many gaps in the physical map of RFLP and SSR markers ( Fig. 2 ). Therefore, ILPs are a new source of STS markers different from SSRs and can complement SSR and RFLP markers. In principle, every ILP is potentially a genetic marker as long as a suitable detection method is available. 3.3. ILP markers exploited by experiment In order to detect ILPs by non-denaturing PAGE or agarose gel electrophoresis, we only chose candidate ILP markers with ILD ≥ 3 bp for the experiment. Of the 215 candidate ILP markers tested, 173 (80.47%) yielded stable and clear PCR products as expected in both Nipponbare and 93-11, and appeared to be codominant in the F 1 . Besides, six (2.79%) candidate ILP markers yielded the expected PCR products in either of the parents and appeared to be dominant in the F 1 . The number of ILP markers on each chromosome is shown in Table 2 . Number of ILP markers obtained by experimentNumber of ILP markers obtained by experimentTo increase PCR specificity in the amplification of ILP loci, we adopted a Td-PCR program. Most (138/173) of the ILP markers obtained could be amplified well by the Td-PCR with the default initial annealing temperature (59°C). Some other (25 or 8) markers required a lower (57°C) or higher (60°C) initial annealing temperature. Eight markers could be well amplified at a constant annealing temperature (54°C). We further tested the 173 codominant markers on 10 rice varieties. All the markers were successfully detected in those varieties ( Fig. 5 ), suggesting that the markers exploited are widely applicable. Based on the resolution capacity of the non-denaturing PAGE or agarose gel used, it appeared that most of the markers only possessed 2 (i.e. Nipponbare's and 93-11's) alleles among the 10 varieties. Only nine markers appeared to have multiple alleles, of which five were attributed to SSR variation. The PIC values of the markers varied from 0.18 to 0.66 with an average of 0.451. The results indicate that the polymorphism level of ILP marker is not high in general. However, a higher estimate of the polymorphism level of ILP markers could probably be obtained if methods of DNA fragment analysis with higher resolution capacity (e.g. denaturing PAGE, usually used for SSR analysis or DNA sequencing) were adopted.

WIN-PCR for ILP detection In the present study, we adopted electronic EPIC-PCR to screen for candidate ILP markers. However, because the ILDs of >70% candidate ILP markers were <5 bp ( Fig. 3 ) and the average size of the EPIC-PCR products was ∼580 bp, most of the candidate ILP markers would be difficult to detect by real EPIC-PCR. To solve this problem, a possible way is to design PCR primers within introns so as to obtain smaller PCR products. For this purpose, we examined nucleotide substitutions (SNPs) in introns between Nipponbare and 93-11 by sequence comparison in silico . We identified 17 374 putative nucleotide substitutions in the introns of the 5811 candidate ILP markers, approximately equivalent to 6 SNPs/kb ( Table 3 ). Although the estimate of SNP frequency in intron sequences between the two subspecies of rice is much larger than that of whole genome average (1.06 SNPs/kb), 29 it is still not very high. Hence, it should be suitable to design PCR primers within introns to detect cross-subspecies ILPs in rice. To distinguish this technique, we call this approach Within INtron PCR (WIN-PCR). In this study, we have obtained 57 ILP markers from 69 candidate ILP markers by WIN-PCR. The success rate (57/69 = 82.61%) is very similar to that of EPIC-PCR (122/146 = 83.56%) ( Table 2 ). The results indicate that WIN-PCR could be as efficient as EPIC-PCR. In principle, WIN-PCR would permit the detection of single-nucleotide ILPs.

Subspecies specificity and intra-subspecies diversity of ILPs Among the 10 accessions used for ILP analysis in the present study ( Table 1 ), 93-11, Guangluai-4 and Xieqingzao could be taken as typical indica cultivars and Nipponbare, Xiushui-11 and Koshihikari as typical japonica cultivars according to their origins. Based on these typical accessions, 123 (71.1%) out of the 173 ILP markers tested showed subspecies-specific genotypes (i.e. different between but the same within subspecies). The result suggests that ILPs in rice have apparent subspecies specificity. This feature could be useful for analyzing the genetic compositions of rice cultivars. A typical example comes from the accession Kyeema. The accession was categorized as an indica cultivar based on morphological characters. 40 However, we have found that it is more likely to be a japonica cultivar because out of the 123 subspecies-specific ILP markers assayed on it, only 21 (17.1%) exhibited indica genotype, while 100 (81.3%) showed japonica genotype. This is consistent with its pedigree. In fact, Kyeema was derived from a triple cross involving one indica (Della) and two japonica (Pelde and Kulu) parents. We can expect that the offspring of the triple cross (Pelde//Della/Kulu) would contain 25% indica and 75% japonica genetic components on average. We see that the proportions in Kyeema's genome estimated by ILP markers are close to the expected values. Another example worthy of note is the accession Katy, a suggested japonica cultivar derived from a complicated cross Bonnet73/CI9722//Starbonnet/Tetep///Lebonnet, where Tetep is a typical indica parent. Our study has found that out of the 123 subspecies-specific ILP markers, 22 (17.9%) showed indica genotype in Katy. Therefore, Katy cannot be a typical japonica cultivar. In addition, 9 ILP markers showed heterozygous genotypes in Katy, suggesting that the accession might not be a pure line. A more interesting result we obtained concerns the javanica variety Merim. In this accession, 94 (or 76.4%) out of the 123 subspecies-specific ILP markers showed japonica genotype. This confirms that javanica belongs to japonica . 41 Although ILPs in rice have strong subspecies specificity, they still exist within subspecies. Based on the three typical indica and three typical japonica cultivars mentioned above, we found that of the 173 ILP markers tested, 44 (25.4%) showed polymorphisms among indica cultivars and 10 (5.8%) showed polymorphisms among japonica cultivars. The result indicates that indica rice has much higher genetic diversity than japonica rice. This is consistent with previous studies based on RAPD 42 and RFLP 43 markers. The finding implies that indica rice might have evolved earlier than japonica rice. 3.6. Transferability of ILP markers to other plants We randomly selected 51 pairs of rice ILP primers to perform EPIC-PCR in other 8 plants (see Materials and Methods) and found that 24 (47.1%) pairs yielded desirable results with 1–5 clear and stable bands in all the plants; 31 (60.8%) pairs worked well in all the 5 Gramineae plants; only 6 (11.8%) pairs did not generate any PCR products. In cotton alone, 36 (70.6%) pairs of the primers yielded clear and stable PCR products and 11 (30.6%) of them revealed polymorphisms between two cultivated cotton species, Gossypium barbadense L. and Gossypium hirsutum L. The results suggest that a high proportion of rice ILP markers are transferable to other plants.  To examine whether the PCR products in other plants were really specifically amplified or homologous to the target genes in rice, we randomly isolated electrophoretic bands produced by primer pair RI02862 from wheat, maize and cotton, respectively ( Fig. 6 ) and sequenced them (by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering & Technology Company). Multiple alignment of the sequences of wheat, maize and cotton together with those of rice using computer programs ClustalX 44 and GeneDoc 45 showed that they were really from homologous genes as expected: the exon regions (two sides) were well conserved and the intron region (middle) were highly varied among the plants ( Fig. 7 ). This suggests that most, if not all, of the clear and stable PCR products obtained in other plants must be resulted from specific amplification.

Lanes from left to right: 1 = japonica rice (Nipponbare); 2 = indica rice (93-11); 3 = barley; 4 = wheat; 5 = maize; 6 = sorghum; 7 = bamboo; 8 = rape; 9 = tobacco; 10 = cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.); 11 = cotton ( Gossypium barbadense L.).

Multiple alignment of sequences amplified from maize, wheat and cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) by primer pair RI02862 and available target sequences from japonica rice (Nipponbare) and indica rice (93-11).  For comparison, we also applied 32 pairs of rice SSR primers to the 9 plants. We found that although all the SSR primers could generate PCR products in all the plants, the electrophoretic bands produced by each pair of primers were generally quite many (at least 10) and unstable, suggesting that most, if not all, of the bands are produced by unspecific amplification as seen in the randomly primed markers such as RAPD. 9 Therefore, it appears that most of the rice SSR markers are not transferable to other plants, but can only serve as unspecific PCR markers in other plants. 3.7. Advantages of ILP markersILP is a new type of molecular marker, which has not been reported extensively. We have seen that ILPs are abundant between the two cultivated subspecies in rice. ILP has many similar advantages to SSR including specific (being a STS marker), codominant (providing complete information of genotypes), neutral (no phenotypic effect), convenient (detectable by PCR) and reliable (result stable). In addition, ILP has a special advantage, namely, it directly reflects variation within genes. Therefore, the genetic maps constructed with ILP markers would be more valuable for genetic studies because they are similar to conventional maps consisting of morphological markers. Moreover, ILP marker would be more useful for marker-assisted breeding because it allows us to trace a gene directly as long as an ILP can be found in the gene.We have seen that ILPs have significant subspecies specificity in rice. This characteristic could be useful for genetic study and breeding in rice. Apart from the use for analyzing genetic compositions of rice cultivars discussed above, it might be useful for the studies of genome evolution and inter-subspecies heterosis and for cross-subspecies marker-assisted breeding.In addition, we have seen the high transferability of rice ILP markers to other plants. This characteristic would make ILP markers very useful for (i) construction of molecular marker maps in other plants that have weaker genetic research basis; (ii) genome comparison among plants; (iii) gene mapping with the help of synteny or collinearity between model plants and other plants; (iv) research of phylogenetic relationships among different species, genera, families or even higher taxonomic ranks in plants and (v) marker-assisted breeding in other plants.3.8. ILP database We have established a database ( Author Webpage ) for depositing the information of the 5811 candidate ILP markers, including ILP name, cDNA name, japonica BAC clone accession number, japonica BAC clone name, marker start position in japonica (bp), maker end position in japonica (bp), marker length in japonica (bp), indica scaffold name, marker start position in indica (bp), marker end position in indica (bp), marker length in indica (bp), length difference between japonica and indica (bp), position in RFLP map (cM), forward primer and reverse primer. For convenience, the ILP information is searched by key words, such as ILP name, BAC clone and scaffold. In addition, the 173 codominant ILP markers obtained have been submitted to GenBank (accession nos.: BV209990 – BV210161 , BV210393 ).

Genes linked to IFN are well known to influence SLE, but several other novel genes unrelated to IFN signaling we report here would be useful to understand the pathophysiology of SLE.1. IntroductionSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by production of multiple diverse autoantibodies against several self-antigens and resultant injury to various organ systems, including skin, joints, kidney and central nervous system. The pathogenesis of SLE is correlated with both genetic predispositions and environmental influences.1 The contribution of these two factors may differ between individuals, but the resulting malfunctions in the immune system and the production of autoantibodies plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE. Previous studies have revealed that symptoms resembling SLE appear in a variety of immunological disorders,1–3 but the mechanisms of SLE pathogenesis are not known, and the cause of the diversity of symptoms is unclear.Recent reports using cDNA/oligonucleotide array analysis on gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SLE patients have identified candidate genes responsible for SLE pathophysiology.4–7 Several interferon (IFN) related genes are highly overexpressed in the peripheral blood and kidney glomeruli of SLE patients, supporting a central role for IFN in SLE.8,9 Activation of the IFN-α pathway defines a subgroup of SLE patients whose condition is characterized by increased disease severity.10 In some SLE patients, activated T cells seem to resist anergy and apoptosis by markedly upregulating and sustaining cyclooxygenase-2 expression.11 However, the pathological significance of these changes in gene expression remains controversial and whether the changes are specific to SLE is open to question.12,13We have developed a novel variation of the subtractive hybridization technique called stepwise subtraction for comprehensive gene discovery, wherein the subtraction process is systematically repeated in a stepwise manner to isolate essentially all of the genes whose expression is specifically upregulated relative to a control population.14 This technique has proven useful in the discovery of genes specifically expressed during cancer metastasis, meiosis and spermatogenesis.14,16 This technique complements cDNA microarray analysis because it can isolate novel genes that were not identified by microarray screening.17 Here, we applied the stepwise subtraction method together with microarray analysis to identify a set of genes differentially expressed in SLE, including several candidates which have not been previously associated with SLE. The expression of these genes was confirmed and quantified with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT–PCR and the expression levels were compared to indicators of SLE pathology. In addition, we investigated patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is an organ-specific autoimmune disease. We compared the levels of gene expression in SLE patients with those in ITP patients and identified changes in gene expression that are specific to each condition.2. Materials and Methods2.1 Human subjects: patients and healthy controlsBlood was obtained from 133 SLE patients (8 men and 125 women) and eight healthy controls (4 men and 4 women) (Supplementary Table 1, set A), for stepwise subtractive hybridization and microarray analysis. For real-time RT–PCR, 31 SLE patients (1 man and 30 women) were randomly selected from set A. Independently, blood samples from 25 ITP patients (8 men and 17 women), and 30 healthy controls (all women) were analyzed (Supplementary Table 1B, set B). Written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. This study was performed according to the guidelines of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, which abides by the Helsinki Declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. All SLE patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE.18 ITP patients were diagnosed based on idiopathic thrombocytopenia (platelets <100 × 109/l) and megakaryocytic hyperplasia or normoplasia in the bone marrow, when other causes had been excluded. Clinical manifestations and laboratory features of the SLE patients were also examined, including the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score,19 counts of peripheral lymphocytes, dosages of oral glucocorticoid or immunosuppressants, ages of the patients and length of time from disease onset.2.2 RNA isolation and multiple tissue cDNA panelsHeparinized venous blood (10 ml) was mixed with an equal volume of 2% dextran/saline solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to precipitate red blood cells. PBMC in the supernatant were purified by density-gradient centrifugation on Percoll (density = 1.064 g/ml). Total RNA was extracted from the PMBC pellets by adding guanidine-thiocyanate solution and the samples were used for cDNA library preparation and subtractive hybridization or acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction for real-time RT–PCR.20 To analyze the expression pattern of some SLE-upregulated genes, PCR was performed on multiple tissue cDNA panels (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the coding sense and antisense primers for 25–40 cycles (see Figure 5) at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. ExTaq DNA polymerase was purchased from TaKaRa Co. Ltd (Otsu, Japan).2.3 Preparation of cDNA library and stepwise subtractionAn SLE cDNA library was constructed from PBMC of 133 SLE patients (Supplementary Table 1, Set A) using the linker-primer method with a pAP3neo vector, as described previously.20 We also prepared mRNA from PBMC of healthy controls (Supplementary Table 1, Set A) and biotinylated the mRNA with photobiotin to perform cDNA subtractions.20 To analyze the quality of the first-stage subtracted cDNA library, cDNA inserts from 480 randomly selected cDNA clones were restriction digested with EcoRI and NotI, and the fragments isolated from 1% agarose gels. The fragments were then 32P-labeled to use as probes for northern analysis to identify SLE specific clones (see Figure 1B). The stepwise subtraction of this cDNA library was performed as described previously.14 We isolated almost all of the SLE specific clones included in the original cDNA library from the first and second subtraction, since only a few independent cDNA clones were detected in the third subtraction. The DNA sequences of the SLE specific clones were determined using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 377; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).Northern blots of individual AILE cDNA clones to compare the expression levels of the genes in SLE patients and normal controls (see Supplementary Table 1, Set A). A northern blot with GAPDH probe is shown as a loading control.Northern blots of individual AILE cDNA clones to compare the expression levels of the genes in SLE patients and normal controls (see Supplementary Table 1, Set A). A northern blot with GAPDH probe is shown as a loading control.2.4 DNA microarray analysisThe quality of the RNA samples was examined using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (p/n 5065-4476) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (G2940BA; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total RNA (500 ng) from PBMC of 133 SLE patients or 8 healthy volunteers was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primers containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence, and the cDNAs were then subjected to in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase to label cDNAs with Cy3 or Cy5 (CyDye, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Cy-labeled cRNA from SLE patients (1 µg) was mixed with the same amount of reverse color Cy-labeled product from an equal amount of pooled cRNA from healthy volunteers. Labeled cRNAs were fragmented to an average size of approximately 50–100 nt by heating at 60°C in the presence of 10 mM ZnCl2, and the samples were then added to a hybridization buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 0.5% sodium sarcosine, 50 mM MES (pH 6.5) and formamide to a final concentration of 30%, in a final volume 3 ml. Hybridizations with the Agilent's whole human genome microarray (Hu44K) were conducted at 40°C. Sequences for microarrays were selected from RefSeq (a collection of non-redundant mRNA sequences; Author Webpage) and from expressed sequence tag (EST) contigs (Author Webpage). Each mRNA or EST contig was represented on the Hu44K microarray by a single 60mer oligonucleotide chosen by the oligonucleotide probe design program. After hybridization, slides were washed and scanned using an Agilent confocal laser scanner (G2565BA). Fluorescence intensities on scanned images were quantified, corrected for background noise and normalized. Fluorophore reversal (dye swap) duplicates were used in two-color DNA microarray experiments.2.5 Quantitative real-time PCRRelative quantitation with real-time RT–PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the Assay-on-Demand TaqMan probe and relevant primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (500 ng) obtained by acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (ABI). The cDNA was used as a template for PCR in a 50 µl reaction using 2× Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (TaKaRa). PCR consisted of initial denaturation (95°C, 10 min), then 40 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 15 s) and annealing/extension (60°C, 1 min). Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate and the median threshold cycle (CT) values were used to calculate the fold change (FC) between patient and control samples. Standard deviation and standard error were also calculated. A standard curve from the amplification data for each primer was generated using a dilution series of total RNA from PBMC as templates, FC values were normalized to GAPDH levels using the standard curve method according to the manufacturer's protocol.2.6 Purification of T cells and B cells, and their characteristicsPBMC from three SLE patients were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). T or B cells were purified by magnetic cell sorting (MACS) using a StemSep™ Kit (Stem Cell Technologies Inc., British Columbia, Canada). We found that more than 95 or 93% of T or B cells purified by MACS were CD3 positive or CD19 positive, respectively. Purified CD3/CD19 positive populations were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan Cytometer, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System, Mountain View, CA, USA).2.7 Statistical analysisSignificant differences were determined using the Mann–Whitney U-test or Spearman's rank correlation. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.3. Results3.1 Identification of SLE specific genes by stepwise subtraction and DNA microarray analysisTo identify the putative SLE specific genes that are upregulated in PBMC of SLE patients compared to healthy volunteers, we applied stepwise subtractive hybridization.14 Briefly, we prepared a pooled cDNA library using mRNA from 133 SLE patients (Supplementary Table 1, Set A) using the linker-primer method with a pAP3neo vector. Subtractive hybridization used biotinylated mRNA from 8 healthy volunteers (4 males and 4 females; Set A), generating the first subtracted cDNA library, as described previously.20 The SLE-upregulated genes were identified by northern blot analysis using DNA inserts from randomly selected cDNA clones of the subtracted cDNA library. We performed the stepwise subtraction three times. Since we did not obtain any new SLE-upregulated genes in the third subtracted cDNA library (data not shown), the analysis was terminated at this point. We identified 25 SLE-upregulated genes by northern blot analysis (Figure 1) and named them AILE genes (augmented expression in SLE). As listed in Table 1. AILE1 (G0S2) is a lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene whose expression may be required to commit cells to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle.21AILE4 (IFI-15K) and AILE11 (ISG20) are IFN-inducible genes. AILE8, AILE9, AILE14 and AILE18 are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) related genes. AILE6, AILE24 and AILE25 are erythroblast related genes, whereas AILE19 and AILE20 are thymosin related genes.List of AILE genes identified by stepwise subtractionUnknown genes are shown in boldface. The genes that were also identified as SLE-upregulated genes by microarray screening (see Supplementary Table 3) are underlined.

The genes that were also identified as SLE-upregulated genes by microarray screening (see Supplementary Table 3) are underlined. The sequence descriptions of genes that displayed either SLE or ITP specific upregulation are shown in italics.We also performed DNA microarray analysis using the Agilent Hu44K array with the same samples of pooled RNA obtained from SLE patients and healthy volunteers. The list of the genes that were upregulated 7.8-fold or more in SLE patients relative to controls (top 50) is shown in Table 2. Five IFN-α-inducible genes (IFIG) (AK095039, IFIT1, IFIT4, IFI44 and G1P2) were identified as SLE-upregulated genes. Notably, G0S2 (AILE1), G1P2 (AILE4), JunB (AILE21) and PRG1 were identified as SLE-upregulated genes by both stepwise subtraction and microarray analysis. AY358224, which showed the most significant difference between SLE patients and normal volunteers in the microarray screening, encodes an uncharacterized protein. Because AY358224 showed SLE-dependent upregulation we named it SLED1 (see below).List of SLE-upregulated genes identified by DNA microarray analysisUnknown genes are shown in boldface.

We selected 31 SLE patients from the same hospital (Supplementary Table 1, Set B) and 30 young females (age 18–20) as controls, in addition to the original controls (Set A). We tested 16 AILE genes (Table 1) and 6 SLE-upregulated genes (Table 2) for SLE specific upregulation by semi-quantitative PCR. We did not test the genes that encoded ribosomal proteins, hemoglobin gamma, ferritin, MLA-F or proteoglycan 1, because they are not considered to be causative for SLE. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, the standard deviation for quadruplicate measurements from the same individual was small, and this reproducibility indicates that the values provide a reliable measure of gene expression levels.As shown in Figure 2, the IFI27, epithelial-stromal interaction 1 (EPSTI1), G1P2 (AILE4), ISG20 (AILE11), SLED1 and DEFA3 (AILE7) genes showed enhanced expression in many of the SLE patients. IFI27, G1P2 and ISG20 are IFIG; which is consistent with previous work showing that IFN-α is the predominant stimulus for FIG expression in lupus.9 Moreover, we found that expression of defensin-3α (DEFA33), which is a major product of immature granulocytes and has antimicrobial activity, is enhanced in the PBMC of many SLE patients. EPSTI1 is one of the upregulated genes in invasive breast carcinomas,22 but this is the first report correlating upregulation of EPSTI1 with SLE.Expression levels of SLE-upregulated genes. (A) The expression levels of the genes that are more highly upregulated in SLE than ITP. This group includes IFI27, IFN-α-inducible protein G1P2 (AILE4) and SLED1 (AY358224). Note the scale breaks for IFI27 SLE samples. (B) The expression levels of the genes that are similarly upregulated in both SLE and ITP. This group includes EPSTI1, DEFA3 and ISG20. (C) The expression levels of the genes that are more highly upregulated in ITP than SLE. This group includes AILE3 and AREG.

These data are consistent with the northern blot analysis showing a dramatic upregulation of AILE1 in SLE patients. However, when expression levels were compared to those of eight Set B controls, expression levels were similar to SLE patients. When we performed another series of real time RT–PCR assays with 30 Set B controls, they showed slightly enhanced expression relative to SLE patients. Thus, changes in G0S2 expression do not appear to be correlated to SLE. Other tested genes did not show any significant increase as compared to healthy controls (Supplementary Figure 3).3.3. Comparison with ITPWe next compared the expression levels of these genes in each SLE and ITP patient, and found three trends. Type A genes, comprised of IFI27, G1P2 and SLED1, are upregulated in SLE relative to ITP (Figure 2A). These genes can be used as SLE specific gene markers to distinguish SLE from ITP. Type B genes, which include EPSTI1, DEFA3 and ISG20, showed similar levels of expression in both SLE and ITP (Figure 2B). These genes can be used as gene markers to identify both SLE and ITP. Type C genes, consisting of AILE3 and amphiregulin (AREG), are more conspicuously upregulated in ITP than SLE (Figure 2C). These genes can be used as ITP specific gene markers to distinguish ITP from SLE.3.4. Correlation analysisThe correlations among expression levels of these genes showed that the genes linked to IFN (IFI27, G1P2 and ISG20) displayed strong positive correlations in upregulation of gene expression (Figure 3A). EPSTI1 expression also showed a strong positive correlation with G1P2 and ISG20 expression, suggesting that EPSTI1 is somehow correlated with IFN relevant events. SLED1 expression displayed a weak but significant positive correlation with ISG20 expression (Figure 3B).Positive correlations among expression of SLE upregulated genes. (A) Expression of IFI27 showed a strong positive correlation with G1P2 (r = 0.661) and a weak correlation with ISG20 (r = 0.377) expression. In addition, EPSTI1 expression showed a strong positive correlation with that of G1P2 and ISG20 (r = 0.85 and 0.681, respectively). (B) SLED1 expression displayed a weak positive correlation with ISG20 expression (r = 0.495). All correlations were significant (P < 0.05).Positive correlations among expression of SLE upregulated genes. (A) Expression of IFI27 showed a strong positive correlation with G1P2 (r = 0.661) and a weak correlation with ISG20 (r = 0.377) expression. In addition, EPSTI1 expression showed a strong positive correlation with that of G1P2 and ISG20 (r = 0.85 and 0.681, respectively). (B) SLED1 expression displayed a weak positive correlation with ISG20 expression (r = 0.495). All correlations were significant (P < 0.05).Next, we examined correlations of these genes with clinical manifestations, including the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), numbers of fulfilled classification criteria for SLE (NFCCS), presence or absence of lupus nephritis, counts of peripheral lymphocytes, dosages of oral steroid, ages of the patients and length of time since disease onset. We found significant negative correlations between lymphocyte counts and expression levels of ISG20, EPSTI1 and SLED1 (Figure 4A). We also found a reasonably good negative correlation between the NFCCS and the expression level of AREG (Figure 4B). Other clinical symptoms showed no significant correlations.Correlation between the levels of gene expression and clinical data. (A) Significant negative correlations were observed between lymphocyte (Ly) counts and the levels of ISG20 (r = −0.358), EPSTI1 (r = −0.39) and SLED1 (r = −0.396). (B) A negative correlation was also detected between numbers of SLE disease criteria and the level of AREG (r = −0.366). All correlations were significant (P < 0.05).Correlation between the levels of gene expression and clinical data.

(B) A negative correlation was also detected between numbers of SLE disease criteria and the level of AREG (r = −0.366). All correlations were significant (P < 0.05).3.5. Expression pattern in PBMCTo analyze the expression pattern in human blood cell fractions of SLE-upregulated genes whose expressions are enhanced in many of the SLE patients (Figure 2A and B), we performed RT–PCR on multiple tissue cDNA panels (MTC from Clontech) and blood cell RNA of SLE patients (Figure 5). RT–PCR identified IFI27 and G1P2 genes as being expressed ubiquitously in most of the MTC blood cell fractions (Figure 5, lanes 1–9) and in SLE (Figure 5, lanes 13–15). The expression of SLED1 is weak and localized to specific cell subsets, namely, monocytes (lane 4) and T and B cells (lanes 2–4). This result is consistent with the observation of SLED1 expression in the whole blood fraction (total blood leukocytes) of an SLE patient (lane 13). EPSTI1 was expressed in most cell types, except for activated CD4+ T cells (lane 8), and was detected prominently in the total blood leukocyte fraction (lane 13) in SLE patients, suggesting that the dramatically increased expression (5–50-fold) of the EPSTI1 gene (Figure 2B) results from monocytes rather than from B or T cells. ISG20 is expressed in T and B cells but not in monocytes (lane 4), similar to SLE patients (lanes 14 and 15). DEFA3 is expressed in suppressor T cells (lane 2), B cells (lane 5), and more prominently in other blood cells (lane 1), but expression of DEFA3 in T and B cells increased in SLE patients (lanes 13–15). These results indicate that the expression pattern of these genes are not largely altered in SLE patientsRT–PCR amplification of IFI27, EPSTI1, G1P2, ISG20, SLED1, DEFA3, AILE3 and AREG. GAPDH was amplified as a loading control. The multiple tissue cDNA panel for human blood fractions (MTC, Clontech)(lanes 1–12) and SLE patients' blood fractions (lanes 13–15) were examined. 30 cycles of amplification were used for PCR, except as noted at the right of the panels: (#) 40 cycles, (*) 35 cycles or ($) 25 cycles.

DiscussionIn the present study, we comprehensively isolated and analyzed the expression levels of genes that are upregulated in the PBMC of SLE patients, using stepwise subtractive hybridization in combination with oligonucleotide microarray analysis. This study identified many novel SLE-upregulated genes, in addition to IFN responsive genes, such as IFI27, G1P2 and ISG20, which had been previously identified as upregulated in SLE using microarray analysis.4–6 The importance of the type I IFN system in the etiology of SLE has garnered much attention.8,23 The serum levels of IFN-α, a major effector in response to viral infection, is correlated with SLE disease activity, and IFN-α therapy sometimes produces autoimmune side effects, which resemble genuine SLE, including production of autoantibodies.24 However, we did not isolate the transcript for IFN itself as an SLE-upregulated gene. The major IFN-producing cells, i.e. natural IFN-α producing cells (NIPC), are continuously activated in SLE, producing IFN.25 The activator for NIPC remains to be elucidated but candidates are autoantibodies, unmethylated CpG motifs, or the presence of necrotic or apoptotic cells. NIPC, which are reported to resemble immature dendritic cells in phenotype,26 are a very minor component of PBMC. This may be why IFN mRNA was not detected.We identified DEFA3, a major product of immature granulocytes, as an SLE-upregulated gene, which supports the previous data.5 Here, we found that DEFA3 was also upregulated in ITP. DEFA3 was also upregulated in PBMC of rheumatoid arthritis patients.27 Thus, DEFA3 upregulation might be a general feature of autoimmune diseases. EPSTI1 expression is enhanced in breast cancer upon direct interaction between tumor cells and stromal cells in the tumor environment assay.22EPSTI1 is also upregulated in small intestine, spleen, salivary gland, testes and placenta, though its function remains to be elucidated.AREG is a heparin-binding, heparin-inhibited member of the epidermal growth factor family and an autocrine growth factor for human keratinocytes. AREG plays an important role in psoriatic hyperplasia, and inhibition of AREG activity could be an efficacious therapeutic strategy for psoriasis.28 Our results suggest that inhibition of AREG activity may also be a therapeutic strategy for SLE or ITP. AILE3 encodes an uncharacterized protein that belongs to the acetyltransferase family. SLED1 encodes a small protein originally identified by the secreted protein discovery initiative (SPDI) (Genentech, Inc., CA, USA) as a secreted or transmembrane protein. Characterization of these proteins remains for future studies.We classified the SLE upregulated genes by comparison to ITP and identified three groups. The genes which are more highly upregulated in SLE than ITP (IFI27, G1P2 and SLED1), might influence systemic inflammation. Among them, IFI27 is most significantly upregulated. Genes which displayed the same levels of transcriptional upregulation in SLE and ITP (EPSTI1, ISG20 and DEFA3), might be genes that are generally upregulated in autoimmune diseases. Genes showing more enhanced expression in ITP than SLE (AILE3 and AREG), might be correlated with the organ-specific destruction of thrombocytes.Taken together, we identified several novel SLE-upregulated genes whose expression profiling may provide a useful measure of the pathophysiology of SLE. Using the combination of stepwise subtractive hybridization and microarray analysis, the genes we detected should be very specifically correlated with SLE. Genes linked to IFN are well known to influence SLE, but here we isolated several other novel genes unrelated to IFN signaling. Further investigation is needed to clarify their roles in the pathogenesis of SLE.Supplementary materialSupplementary material is available online at Author Webpage.The authors thank the patients and healthy volunteers who participated in this study.

Introduction Triple-stranded DNA has been generating increased interest not only because of its unique structural characteristics and possible biological significance but also because of its potential utility as a tool for DNA analysis. 1–3 There have been several studies reporting the use of triple-stranded DNA as a tool to cleave specific sites in DNA molecules, to knock out specific genes and to correct mutations. 4–15 Triple-stranded DNA structure particularly with short deoxyoligonucleotides has generally been considered unstable after removal of the protein. 16 During the course of studies on RecA-mediated triple-stranded DNA formation with complementary deoxyoligonucleotides (40 to 120mer), we found that triple-stranded structures at the terminus (or near terminus) of double-stranded DNA is unusually stable against heat, provided that the sequence of the single strand deoxyoligonucleotide is complementary to the 5′ terminal sequence of the double-stranded DNA. This heat stability is drastically increased, to levels even higher than that of double-stranded DNA, when excess complementary deoxyoligonucleotides are present in the reaction mixture. Furthermore, we have found that the heat-stable terminal triple-stranded structures are formed with completely matched complementary deoxyoligonucleotides, but not with those carrying a single mismatched base regardless of its position. In this manuscript, we describe the basic characteristics of terminal triple-stranded DNA, and show that our findings can be applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection without DNA dissociation and/or hybridization.2. Materials and methods2.1. Materials M13mp18RF DNA and pBR322 DNA were purchased from Takara-Bio (Shiga, Japan). pBR322 DNA with a substituted base was prepared by PCR using primers (40mer), one of which contained a mismatched base, and Sca I pBR322 DNA fragment as a template. The PCR products were purified by agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis and DNA was eluted from the corresponding band using a DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Deoxyoligonucleotides (HPLC purified grade) were custom-synthesized by Sawady Technology (Tokyo, Japan). Deoxyoligonucleotides were labeled at 5′ terminus with T4 polynucleotide kinase and 32 P-ATP using a kit (MEGALABEL™ Labeling kit, Takara-Bio). RecA protein was purchased from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, USA). ATP-γS and proteinase K were obtained by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). 2.2. Standard reaction for the triple-stranded DNA formationA reaction mixture (50 µl) containing a deoxyoligonucleotide complementary to target DNA (5 pmol), RecA protein (30 µg), ATP-γS (4.8 mM), Mg-acetate (2 mM) and Tris–acetate (30 mM, pH 7.2) was first incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The mixture was then combined with a mixture (50 µl) containing target DNA (10 µg), Mg-acetate (20 mM) and Tris–acetate (30 mM, pH 7.2) and incubated for another 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 µl SDS (10%, w/v), 5 µl EDTA (500 mM, pH 8.0) and 0.5 µl proteinase K (22 mg/ml), further incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and subjected to phenol/chloroform treatment. Excess deoxyoligonucleotides were removed through a Sephacryl S-400 HR column (Amersham-Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated with TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA).2.3. Analysis of SNPs in human genomic DNA The region of 950 bp sequence of human genomic DNA (GenBank accession number AC004465 ) in which an SNP site of interest is positioned at 40 nt from the terminus in three human genomic DNA preparations was amplified by PCR. The genomic DNA preparations were kindly supplied by Drs Y. Ohnishi and Y. Nakamura, the University of Tokyo. The PCR products, prepared after 25 cycles of PCR using the genomic DNA (200 ng) and PCR primers (GenBank accession number AC004465 , nt 2701–2720 and nt 3631–3650), were subjected to triple-stranded DNA formation with a set of labeled deoxyoligonucleotides. The reaction was performed by incubating a reaction mixture (20 µl) which contained amplified DNA (400 ng), a labeled probe (1 pmol), RecA protein (3 µg), ATP-γS (4.8 mM), Mg-acetate (20 mM) and Tris–acetate (30 mM, pH 7.2) for 60 min at 37°C. After removal of RecA protein and excess deoxyoligonucleotides through a TE buffer equilibrated Sephacryl S-400 HR column (two cycles), samples (20 µl) were incubated at 85°C for 10 min in the presence of a mixture of four cold deoxyoligonucleotides (10 pmol, each). The samples were then subjected to heat treatment at 80°C (85°C for the experiments shown in Figs 5 and 6) for 10 min (25°C for 10 min for the controls). The deoxyoligonucleotides were then removed through Sephacryl S-400 HR column (one cycle), and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel (1%) and autoradiographed. 3.

The polarity of the third strand in terminal triple-strand formation We performed an experiment in which M13mp18RF DNA (7249 bp) linearized by digestion with Sna BI was incubated with RecA protein and one of four 32 P-labeled 60mer deoxyoligonucleotides (oligo-1, 2, 3 and 4, Fig. 1A ). The labeled deoxyoligonucleotide sequences were complementary to the terminal sequences of the double-stranded DNA. After removal of RecA protein, the products were electrophoresed and autoradiographed. Triple-stranded DNA formed with a deoxyoligonucleotide (oligo-1) complementary to the 5′-phosphate terminal sequence (nt 1270–1329) of the double-stranded DNA or that formed with oligo-3 identical to the 3′-OH terminal sequence (nt 1210–1269) displayed signal at the position where linear M13mp18RF DNA was expected to migrate ( Fig. 1B , lane 1 or lane 3, respectively). In contrast, no signal was detected when the double-stranded DNA was incubated with oligo-2 identical to the 5′-phosphate terminal sequence (nt 1270–1329) or oligo-4 complementary to the 3′-OH terminal sequence (nt 1210–1269) ( Fig. 1B , lane 2 or lane 4, respectively). Similar results were obtained when the terminal sequence of linearized pBR322 DNA or pUC118 DNA was used as a target DNA for the formation of the triple-stranded molecules (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that a triple-stranded structure at the ends of a double-stranded DNA is formed with deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-phosphate terminal sequences of both strands, but not with those complementary to the 3′-OH termini, and that the triple-stranded structures thus formed are stable even after the removal of RecA protein. We estimate that 80–90% of the target DNA is converted to triple-stranded structure under the conditions we employed (data not shown).

Effect of the position of triple-stranded structure relative to the DNA terminus The stable triple-stranded DNA structure seems to be limited to those formed at the very terminus of double-stranded DNAs. Sna BI digest of M13mp18RF DNA was subjected to triple-stranded DNA formation with labeled deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to different sequences at or near the DNA terminus ( Fig. 2A ). As seen in Fig. 2B , when the 3′ position of the complementary deoxyoligonucleotides (60mer) was moved from the terminus (oligo-1, lane 1) to 10 (oligo-5, lane 2), 20 (oligo-6, lane 3) and 30 nt (oligo-7, lane 4) to the inside of the DNA molecule, the stability of triple-stranded structures formed was dramatically decreased in proportion to the distance from the DNA terminus. Essentially no stable triple-stranded DNA was formed with a deoxyoligonucleotide complementary to DNA sequences inwardly located 30 nt from the terminus ( Fig. 2B , lane 4). The results indicate that stability of triple-stranded DNA is greatly affected by the position of the triple-strand, with those structures formed closer to the 5′ terminus of DNA demonstrating greater stability.

(C) Ethidium bromide patterns of DNA products. Lanes correspond to those shown in (B). Positions of the size markers ( Hin dIII digested λ DNA fragments) in kb are shown at the left side of each figure. For details, see Section 2. As one might expect, we have also found that the stability of triple-stranded DNA is dependent upon the size of the deoxyoligonucleotides employed. Linearized M13mp 18RF DNA was subjected to triple-stranded DNA formation with labeled deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the terminal sequences, but with different chain (nucleotide) lengths. Stable triple-stranded DNA formation was observed with complementary deoxyoligonucleotides of >40 nt (40mer), but the efficiency of the formation was drastically reduced (∼50% of that of 60 nt) with a deoxyoligonucleotide of 30mer. Essentially no stable triple-stranded DNA formation was observed with deoxyoligonucleotides of 20mer or less. (data not shown).3.3. Stability of terminal triple-stranded DNA structures To characterize the stability of terminal triple-stranded structures, triple-stranded DNA formed with M13mp 18RF DNA and labeled 60mer deoxyoligonucleotide (oligo-3) was exposed to different temperature (for 10 min) after removal of RecA protein, and radioactivity associated with M13mp18RF DNA was measured. As seen in Fig. 3A , the deoxyoligonucleotide started to dissociate from the complex at 60°C (lane 2), and was completely dissociated at 75°C (lane 5). The estimated melting temperature was ∼65°C. The melting temperature of a hybrid structure formed from the same deoxyoligonucleotide (oligo-3) and single-stranded M13mp18 DNA was ∼75°C under the same conditions (data not shown). To our surprise, when unlabeled deoxyoligonucleotide (oligo-3) (10-fold excess over the labeled deoxyoligonucleotide) was added during heat treatment, the stability of the formed triple-stranded DNA seemed dramatically increased. At temperatures as high as 95°C, a substantial portion (∼50%) of the deoxyoligonucleotide remained undissociated ( Fig. 3B , lanes 1–9). No such stabilizing activity was observed when the same amount of unlabeled deoxyoligonucleotides (oligo-8) not complementary to the terminal DNA sequence was added (data not shown). The stabilizing effect of complementary deoxyoligonucleotides on terminal triple-stranded DNA is not fully understood at this time. The results are diagrammatically shown in Fig. 3C .  Heat stability of triple-stranded DNA and effects of excess deoxyoligonucleotide. M13mp18RF DNA linearized by Sna BI (200 ng) was subjected to triple-stranded DNA formation with a labeled 60mer deoxyoligonucleotide (oligo-3). The DNA samples (20 µl) were then exposed to different temperatures for 10 min in the absence (A) or presence (B) of unlabeled oligo-3 (10 pmol).

For details, see Section 2. 3.4. Detection of a single mismatched base We found that the formation of terminal triple-stranded DNA can be used for the detection and identification of a single mismatched base in DNA molecules. The linearized pBR322 DNA (GenBank accession number J01749 , 4361 bp) by digestion with Sca I (nt 3847–3846), in which the C–G pair at nucleotide position 3879 within the terminal 60 bp (nt 3847–3906, Fig. 4A , target DNA I) had been replaced to other 3 bp (target DNA II, III and IV), was subjected to triple-stranded DNA formation. Each target DNA was incubated with one of four labeled deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the first 60 bases at the 5′-terminal nucleotide sequence but having the base substitution at the position corresponding to nt 3879 of the template DNA ( Fig. 4A , oligo-8, 9, 10 and 11). In the standard condition, all target DNAs formed stable triple-stranded structures with any combination of deoxyoligonucleotides with or without the base substitution ( Fig. 4B , left panels), indicating that the formation of stable triple-stranded molecules was possible even in the presence of a single mismatched base in the oligonucleotides at 25°C. However, when the triple-stranded molecules formed at 37°C were exposed to a higher temperature (80°C, 10 min) in the presence of excess amounts of corresponding unlabeled deoxyoligonucleotides, the triple-stranded structures formed with completely matched complementary oligonucleotides were observed ( Fig. 4B , right panels), while incubation of the triple-stranded DNAs with deoxyoligonucleotides having a single mismatched base resulted in complete dissociation of the structures. Essentially, the same results were obtained with triple-stranded DNA with complementary deoxyoligonucleotides in which a single nucleotide (nt 3879) is deleted ( Fig. 4A , oligo-12) or an extra nucleotide is inserted ( Fig. 4A , oligo-13, an extra C is inserted at nt 3878–3879).

The DNA samples (20 µl) were incubated at 80°C in the presence of unlabeled completely matched deoxyoligonucleotide (10 pmol) (target DNA I with oligo-8, target DNA II with oligo-9, target DNA III with oligo-10 and target DNA IV with oligo-11).

Effect of the location of mismatched bases A mismatched base can be detected at almost any location in the terminal DNA sequences within at least 120 bp. Triple-stranded DNA was formed at the terminus of Sna BI-treated M13mp18 DNA with labeled 120 bp complementary deoxyoligonucleotides carrying matched ( Fig. 5A , oligo-14) and mismatched bases ( Fig. 5A , oligo-15 to 23). A mismatched base (G, guanine) was placed at different sites over the 120 bp sequence, including one located at the very terminus (oligo-23). Triple-stranded samples obtained at 37°C were then exposed to high temperature (85°C, 10 min) in the presence of unlabeled completely matched deoxyoligonucleotide. As seen in Fig. 5B , although all triple-stranded structures were stably maintained after incubation at a lower temperature (25°C, 10 min) ( Fig. 5B , left panel), deoxyoligonucleotides with a mismatched base were eliminated almost completely from the triple-stranded DNA molecules by exposure to high temperature (85°C, 10 min) ( Fig. 5B , right panel). Figure 5C shows the DNA products detected by ethidium bromide staining. Lanes correspond to those shown in Fig. 5B .  Effect of the position of mismatched bases. M13mp18 Sna BI fragments (nt 1270–1329, 60 bp) (200 ng) were subjected to terminal triple-stranded DNA formation using a series of labeled complementary deoxyoligonucleotides (nt 1270–1389, 120 mer) with a single mismatched base (guanine) at different positions (oligo-14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23). After removal of RecA protein as well as excess deoxyoligonucleotides through a Sephacryl S-400 spin column, samples (20 µl) were incubated at 85°C in the presence of unlabeled completely matched deoxyoligonucleotide (oligo-14) (10 pmol), subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel (1%) and autoradiographed using X-ray film.

Analysis of SNPs in human genomic DNA We applied our findings for the analysis of SNPs in human genomic DNA (GenBank accession number AC004465 ). The region of 950 bp sequences shown in Figure 6A in which an SNP site of interest is positioned at 40 nucleotides from the terminus was amplified by PCR ( Fig. 6A ). The amplified products from three human genomic DNAs with known allelic variations (C/T, C/C and T/T for human DNA I, II and III, respectively, see Fig. 6A ) were then subjected to terminal triple-stranded DNA formation with a set of labeled deoxyoligonucleotides (oligo-24, 25, 26 and 27, see Fig. 6A ) which cover the primer sequences and SNP sites, and are complementary to one of the terminal sequence of the DNA product amplified from the genomic DNA template. As seen in Fig. 6B and C , after brief heat treatment of the triple-stranded molecules formed at 85°C, very distinct patterns of the labeled products emerged, clearly distinguishing the three different polymorphisms.  Analysis of SNPs in human genomic DNA preparations. Sequences (950 bp) covering an SNP site in three human genomic DNA preparations were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were subjected to triple-stranded DNA formation with a set of labeled deoxyoligonucleotides (oligo-24, 25, 26 and 27) which cover the SNP site and are complementary to one of the terminal sequence of the genomic DNA.

Conclusions In this article, we have shown that stable triple-stranded DNA can be formed at the termini of linear DNA molecules with oligonucleotides complementary to the DNA strand terminating with 5′ phosphate. The formed structure is unusually stable, withstanding heat treatment at as high as 95°C when excess completely matched oligonucleotides are present. In this respect, it should be noted that Radding and his co-workers reported that the stability of the triple-stranded DNA formed over a long stretch of complementary bases (more than a thousand bases) is affected by the polarity of the third strand. 17–19 At present, neither the specific molecular structure of terminal triple-stranded DNA nor the mechanism of its stability is clearly understood. Although we have faced difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of terminal triple-stranded DNA for structural analysis by means of CD spectrum or NMR or X-ray crystallography, this line of experiments is currently under way. If successful, the information obtained should provide vital clues to the interesting phenomena associated with terminal triple-stranded DNA structure. The observation that the terminal triple-stranded structure which withstands at high temperatures is formed only with completely matched complementary oligonucleotides has made it possible to clearly distinguish triple-stranded DNA with a mismatched base from that with completely matched structure. This in turn offers a simple and efficient way to detect and identify single base substitutions in DNA molecules. We have shown that single base substitutions can be detected at almost any location in DNA molecules within at least 120 bp scanning range. This is in quite contrast to widely used conventional procedures for detection of mismatched bases by means of hybridization between single-stranded DNA target and oligonucleotide probes in respect to range of base pairs covered at once and capacity to identify mismatched bases. Needless to say that as the signals obtained with completely matched oligonucleotides are very clear this procedure can be simplified and be higher throughput by combining with other techniques. Efficient and reliable methods of detecting single nucleotide substitutions in DNA molecules are now in great demand, especially for the analysis of SNPs in higher organisms such as humans. We believe that all the procedures described above based upon the unique nature of the terminal triple-stranded DNA, direct probing and detection of single base substitutions should make current DNA technologies to be more efficient and be utilized in a more versatile manner.We thank Osamu Ohara for valuable suggestions and, Koji Okumura and Kazuhiro Kondo for help and encouragement. Thanks are also extended to Masaki Oishi for critical reading the manusript."
