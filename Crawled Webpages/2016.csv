We described a computational framework to construct a linkage–LD map from commonly used biallelic, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for outcrossing plants by which the decline of LD is visualized with genetic distance. The framework was derived from an open-pollinated (OP) design composed of plants randomly sampled from a natural population and seeds from each sampled plant, enabling simultaneous estimation of the LD in the natural population and recombination fraction due to allelic co-segregation during meiosis. We modified the framework to infer evolutionary pasts of natural populations using those marker types that are segregating in a dominant manner, given their role in creating and maintaining population genetic diversity. A sophisticated two-level EM algorithm was implemented to estimate and retrieve the missing information of segregation characterized by dominant-segregating markers such as single methylation polymorphisms. The model was applied to study the relationship between linkage and LD for a non-model outcrossing species, a gymnosperm species, Torreya grandis, naturally distributed in mountains of the southeastern China. The linkage–LD map constructed from various types of molecular markers opens a powerful gateway for studying the history of plant evolution.1. IntroductionLinkage disequilibrium (LD), a concept to describe the non-random association of alleles at different loci, has been a focus of population genetic studies during the last several decades.1 However, since LD is affected by many evolutionary forces, the use of LD alone to infer the genetic structure of populations may generate spurious results.2 For this reason, how LD can be served as a more efficient tool has been one of the most important issues in population and evolutionary genetics. One of the strategies to resolve this issue is constructing a LD map from which to infer population history by visualizing the decline pattern of LD with genetic distance. This strategy has been widely used in human genetics3,4,5 and increasingly recognized in other species.6,7 Many of these LD maps are constructed from the relationship of pairwise LD with the physical distance of the same marker pair, which do not estimate the frequency of recombination between marker loci.The basic principle by which LD is used for historical inference results from its relationship with the recombination rate.1 Therefore, the estimation of the linkage, apart from estimating LD, is an essential step towards constructing a LD map. Wu and Zeng8 pioneered the application of a sampling design to simultaneously estimate these two parameters. By sampling parents randomly from a natural population and the seeds of the sampled parents, this design constructs a two-level hierarchic structure of molecular data, which enables the characterization of how different markers are associated in the original population and how the markers co-transmit their alleles in a Mendelian fashion from the parent to offspring. Lou et al.9 derived a close-form EM algorithm to estimate the LD and recombination rate within a unifying framework. Such a joint linkage–LD analysis has been applied to the genetic mapping of complex traits, leading to the identification of biologically validated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for drought resistance in maize.10 More recently, this strategy has been modified to accommodate to the estimation of genetic imprinting11 and genetic variance.12 Pikkuhookana and Sillanpaa13 implemented a Bayesian algorithm for parameter estimation from this strategy.In this article, we described a general computational framework built on Wu and Zeng's8 open-pollinated design to construct a linkage–LD map using biallelic co-dominant markers. To make this framework more useful for a broader area of applications, we extended it to enable the utilization of dominant-segregating markers. Several recent studies have shown that epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic diversity in natural populations14,15 and also epigenetic marks, such as differential cytosine methylation, may be inherited and have experienced the pressure of natural selection.16 Thus, it has become increasingly important to construct a more comprehensive linkage–LD map by including methylation markers. In epigenetic population studies, there are many ways to score and analyse methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphisms, of which one common approach is to score those fragments that stay unmethylated as 1 and all others methylated as 0. This scoring approach leads to the segregation pattern of the so-called single methylation polymorphism (SMP) markers equivalent to that of dominant genetic markers.17 Lu et al.18 found a possibility of using three-point analysis to enhance the precision and power of linkage detection for dominant markers. Likewise, Li et al.19 developed a three-point analysis to analyse LD among three dominant markers and establish a procedure for testing and estimating multiple disequilibria at different orders. However, the simultaneous estimates of LD and recombination fraction between dominant markers are methodologically challenging, because their genotypes can little explain the information of allelic segregation. We implemented a two-level EM algorithm for joint linkage and LD analysis by modelling and retrieving the unobservable feature of segregating genotypes for dominant-inherited markers. An example was demonstrated to show the utility and usefulness of the model by analysing a real data collected from an OP design of an outcrossing species, Torreya grandis, naturally distributed in mountains of the southeastern China.2. Model2.1. Sampling strategyFrom a natural plant population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), we randomly sample n unrelated maternal individuals and open-pollinated seeds from each sampled plant. This constitutes a two-level hierarchic sampling setting in which both parental plants and their offspring are genotyped by the same set of molecular markers. Consider a pair of biallelic markers A and B, which generate nine joint genotypes, AABB (coded as 1), AABb (coded as 2), …, aabb (coded as 9). Let ni denotes the number of mother plants with marker genotype i, and nij denotes the number of offspring with marker genotype j derived from mother genotype i. Depending on the genotype of a mother, all offspring from her have different numbers of marker genotypes. Table 1 tabulates genotypic observations for the two-level hierarchic setting.

The co-dominant modelLet <U+03C9>1=12<U+03D5>(1-<U+03B8>)+12(1-<U+03D5>)<U+03B8>,<U+03C9>2=12<U+03D5><U+03B8>+12(1-<U+03D5>)(1-<U+03B8>)<U+2060>. Thus, overall haplotype frequencies produced by this parent are calculated as <U+03C9>1for AB or ab and <U+03C9>2 for Ab or aB.Below, an algorithmic procedure will be described to estimate the parameters that define the likelihood.The E and M steps are iterated between Equations (5) and (6) until convergence.The likelihoods under the H0 and H1 are calculated from which a log-likelihood ratio is calculated. By comparing this test statistic with a <U+03C7>2 threshold with two degrees of freedom, we can accept or reject H0.It is also needed to test the significance of D and <U+03B8> separately, showing how the two markers are related. Under the null hypothesis H0:D=0, parental diplotype and genotype frequencies can be simply expressed as a function of allele frequencies which can be estimated with no need of the EM algorithm. Similarly, under the null hypothesis H0:<U+03B8>=0.5<U+2060>, offspring diplotype and genotype frequencies within each family are simply expressed as function of the Mendelian segregation ratio so that no parameter needs to be estimated.2.3. The dominant modelMethylation-sensitive amplification polymorphisms can be scored as a dominant marker.17 For a dominant marker, the homozygote AA for the dominant allele cannot be distinguished from the heterozygote Aa. Thus, these two genotypes are observed as a single ‘phenotype’ (A_). For two dominant markers A and B, some cells for the observations and expected genotype frequencies in Tables 1 and 2 are collapsed in a way as shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Let njA/jB denote the observed number of observations of a two-dominant marker genotype jA/jB, jA= A_ (coded as 1) or aa (coded as 0) and jB= B_ (coded as 1) or bb (coded as 0), in the parental population. Similarly, let njA/jBkA/kB denote the observation of progeny marker genotype kA/kB given its parent genotype jA/jB (Table 3). Frequencies of offspring genotypes from different mother genotypes are shown in Table 4.

The other F's can be interpreted in a similar way.The E and M steps between Equations (9) and (10) are iterated until the estimates are stable. The log-likelihood ratio under the null and alternative hypotheses is calculated and compared with a threshold determined from a <U+03C7>2 distribution.3. ApplicationWe used a real data analysis to demonstrate how the model is used to construct a linkage–LD map. According to Wu and Zeng's8 design, we sampled a natural population of Torreya grandis distributed in the southeastern China.20 In spite of the economic value of T. grandis, this species has not been extensively studied in population genetics. Zeng et al.21 constructed a first low-density genetic map for genus Torreya using an open-pollinated progeny derived from half-sib seeds of a landrace T. grandis ‘Merrillii’, providing basic information for marker genotyping of this species. We sampled 50 unrelated trees randomly from a natural population of T. grandis and 20 progeny for each sampled tree. In total, we obtained (50 + 50 × 20) = 1,050 trees, which were genotyped by 233 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. SRAPs are dominant-segregating markers,22 providing an excellent demonstration for the practical utility of our model. This data set constitutes a two-level hierarchic framework with a high level from the parents and a lower level from the progeny. We analysed each pair of these markers using the dominant model to simultaneously estimate the LD and recombination fraction and further test the significance of these two parameters.Of 233 × 232/2 = 27,028 pairs, 5,733 (21.21%) display significant non-random associations, and 2,140 (7.92%) are significantly linked. It was seen that much fewer pairs (1,239 or 4.58%) are both associated in the original natural population and linked when they co-transmitted during meiosis from the parent to progeny. All this suggests that, for many marker pairs, significant associations are inconsistent with significant linkage. In other words, a pair of unlinked markers may be associated with each other, and also a pair of linked markers may not necessarily have a significant LD. Significant associations of unlinked markers may be due to the impact of some recent evolutionary forces on these markers, whereas the absence of associations between linked markers implies that this particular region of the genome has experienced the random mating of numerous generations.23Based on the estimated pair-wise recombination fractions, we constructed a genetic linkage map using MapMaker software. Under the thresholds of <U+03B8> = 0.3 and LOD = 3.0, 233 markers were grouped into 8 linkage groups, but with 73 markers unlinked. Markers in each linkage group were ordered with an objective function of the sum of adjacent recombination fractions. When the optimal order of a linkage group was determined, the map distance between any two adjacent markers was calculated by Haldane's map function. To the end, we obtained a low-density genetic linkage map for T. grandis (Fig. 1). The total length of the map is 533.2 cM, with an average marker interval of 3.33 cM.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.By plotting pair-wise LD over the genetic distance, we constructed a LD map from which to infer the population history of T. grandis (Fig. 2). In general, the LD declines markedly with marker distance within the first 10 cM of genome, and this decrease quickly becomes gradual after this length. This trend suggests that the population of T. grandis sampled may have experienced a long evolutionary history in the environment where this species grows. However, there are quite a few pairs of unlinked markers beyond 10–20 cM of genetic distance which are associated with a large R2, suggesting that these loci may be subjected to some recent evolutionary forces. Further studies from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are needed to characterize the biological function of these loci and relate this function to possible anthropological selection or climate change towards an in-depth understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of T. grandis.

This figure was also used in the study by Sun et al.23. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.From the distribution of all pair-wise LD, it was found that most pairs of markers do not display a large LD value (Fig. 3), conforming to the result inferred from Fig. 2 that this population may have undertaken a long evolutionary history. Although the LD coefficients tend to be larger between markers located within the same linkage group than between markers from different linkage groups (Fig. 3), a portion of between-group markers has a large LD. This suggests that the genome harbouring these markers may be under recent evolutionary forces. Differences in LD occurrence within and among linkage groups are visualized in Fig. 4. It can be seen that markers in linkage Group 7 are not only rarely associated with those from other linkage groups, but also display a sparse distribution of LD with those within the same linkage group. More specifically, of all 13 × 12/2 = 78 possible combinations between 13 markers of this group, only 15 (19.2%) pairs display significant associations. Yet, such percentages for other linkage groups, such as Groups 2 and 8, were observed to be >60%. A reduced frequency of significant associations in linkage Group 7 suggests that this part of the T. grandis genome may have experienced a long evolutionary history. Relative to linkage Group 7, linkage Groups 2 and 8 has much more frequent LD between different loci from the same and different linkage groups, implying that some recent pressure of natural selection may have taken place in this part of the genome.

Computer simulationTo examine the statistical properties of the model for constructing the LD map with dominant markers, we performed computer simulation by mimicking a natural population at HWE. We randomly sample a panel of unrelated open-pollinated families (each including a female parent and multiple offspring). Given a total of 1,000 progeny, the simulation considers three sampling strategies, 1,000 × 1 (1,000 maternals with a single offspring), 200 × 5 (200 maternals with 5 offspring) and 50 × 20 (50 maternals with 20 offspring). For each strategy, we simulated two co-dominant markers with strong and weak LD, D = 0.15 and 0.02, respectively, in the population. The allele frequencies for the two markers are pA = 0.6 vs. pa = 0.4 and pB = 0.5 vs. pb = 0.5, respectively. The two markers are linked with two sizes of then recombination fraction <U+03B8> = 0.20 and 0.05. In each design, 1,000 simulation replicates were performed to estimate the means of the MLEs for each parameter and their standard deviations. By collapsing the simulated co-dominant marker genotypes into a dominant setting, we can test how well our model performs to construct a dominant LD map.Table 5 gives the results of parameter estimates from simulation studies under different designs. As expected, because of more information contained, co-dominant markers provide better estimation of each parameter than dominant markers, although the drawback of the latter can be overcome by choosing an optimal sampling strategy. General trends of estimation precision of parameters are summarized as follows: (i) LD can be estimated with high accuracy and precision for both co-dominant and dominant markers under all simulation schemes considered. However, as expected, more small families perform better than fewer larger families, because the estimate of LD is based on the sampled parents from the original population. (ii) The estimation of the recombination fraction <U+03B8> is first dependent on the size of LD, followed by the degree of linkage and the sampling strategy. If LD is near zero, then <U+03D5> is close to 12 so that <U+03C9>1 and <U+03C9>2 will not contain <U+03B8>. Thus, <U+03B8> is not estimable when there is no association between the two markers. To better estimate the linkage, precise estimation of LD is essential. MLEs (±standard deviations) of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium and recombination fraction from 1,000 simulation replicates under different sampling strategiesMLEs (±standard deviations) of allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium and recombination fraction from 1,000 simulation replicates under different sampling strategiesAn additional scenario of simulation was conducted by collapsing only one of the two co-dominant markers into a dominant status. As expected, this scenario was intermediate in the precision of parameter estimation between those in which both markers are co-dominant and dominant, respectively. We have also performed simulation studies using the same schemes described above, but by quantitatively changing the values of LD within its interval. This simulation allows us to determine the minimum value of LD beyond which <U+03B8> can be well estimated. In the package of software, we provide the function of determining such an LD value given a sampling strategy and allele frequencies.5. DiscussionSimilar to the HWE, significant departure from linkage equilibrium (LE) indicates that the population studied is undergoing some evolutionary pressure by extensive inbreeding, gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, natural selection, etc. However, unlike HWE, LE cannot be established in one generation of random mating, rather than it needs a number of generations to be reached, because LD declines at a rate that depends on the recombination fraction.1 For this reason, a test of LD about its departure from LE may tell us more stories about the evolutionary history of the population. Just because the use of LD to infer a population's past events is founded on its relationship with the frequency of recombination, a joint estimation of the LD and recombination fraction can provide more precise information about evolutionary inference.8In this article, we extended Wu and Zeng's8 open-pollinated progeny design to construct a linkage–LD map and particularly showed how this design can accommodate to missing information of dominant-segregating markers such as cytosine methylation markers. DNA methylation, as a covalent base modification of plant nuclear genomes, is thought to be accurately inherited through both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions.14 Also, similarly to spontaneous mutations in DNA, errors in the maintenance of methylation states would violate the equilibrium of natural populations, leading to changes in associations between epialleles at different methylated loci. Thus, by constructing a linkage–LD map using those so-called SMPs, we can infer evolutionary pasts of the natural populations from a different perspective.23,15Indeed, as a simple and cheap technique, dominant markers, such as SRAP markers,22 are still being used for many under-represented species including forest trees and wildlife species.24,25,26 Thus, the dominant model described can widen the usefulness of the open-pollinated design in practical population studies. Simulation studies have determined an appropriate sampling strategy to construct a linkage–LD map using dominant markers. Since the precise estimation of LD is of primary importance to linkage estimation, we recommend using many smaller families over small larger families. In addition, the efficiency of linkage–LD map construction can be enhanced by three-point analysis, which has proved to not only provide more information about the genome structure and organization, but also reduce a possibility of biased estimation of the linkage when LD has a small value.27,28 This is especially true for dominant markers.Although the original model for joint linkage and LD analysis was proposed more than a decade ago, its practical use has not occurred until recent years when the collection of molecular markers for under-represented species has been feasible. The current study presents one of the first applications of Wu and Zeng's8 open-pollinated design to study the population structure and history of an outcrossing species. Torreya grandis is a gymnosperm tree species with a large size, endemic to the eastern and southeastern China.20 Because of economic and ecological values, this species has been increasingly studied in terms of its evolutionary history and the genetic control of complex traits.21 The results from a joint linkage and LD analysis with dominant markers suggest that this species has experienced a long history of evolution, but some regions of its genome are subject to a certain recent evolutionary forces. This information will provide guidance for better germplasm management of this important woody plant. Advances in understanding the evolutionary history of Torreya can be made by sampling multiple populations in a range of its distributions. This study, along with the previous one based on half-sib seeds from a single tree of T. grandis reporting a linkage map covering a total of 7,139.9 cM in 10 groups,21 was among the first to construct genetic linkage maps for genus. It is important to align the two maps into a single one for a better coverage of the Torreya genome. Also, much more markers that can align those unlinked markers detected from the current and Zeng et al.'s studies are needed to completely cover 11 chromosomes of T. grandis. A complete coverage of markers allows more extensive studies of variation and examination of LD patterns, which will better reveal levels of complexity for this species.It has been recognized that genetic mapping based on LD analysis helps to fine map complex traits or disease, but this approach may have a high likelihood to detect spurious signals of association, because allelic association can also be due to evolutionary forces rather than physical linkage.2 A joint linkage and LD analysis can overcome this false-positive discovery.27 Thus, the LD map constructed from genetic and epigenetic markers will provide an important fuel to map key QTLs that affect quantitative traits of economic and environmental importance.7FundingThis work is supported by Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in the Public Welfare (201404102); Open Fund for Key Discipline of Forestry of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University (AF201308); Key Scientific Project of Selection and Breeding of New Agricultural Varieties of the Department of Science and Technologies of Zhejiang Province (2012C12904-12); and ‘One-thousand Person Plan’ Award.

IntroductionPrevotella intermedia is a Gram-negative, black-pigmented anaerobic bacterium that is classified into the genus Prevotella belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This bacterium is frequently found in subgingival plaque from patients with periodontal diseases and is considered one of the periodontal pathogens (a member of the so-called ‘orange complex’).1Prevotella is phylogenetically close to other periodontal pathogens, namely Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, which are classified into the same phylum. Prevotella intermedia has also been associated with other oral infections, including endodontic infections,2,3 pregnancy gingivitis4 and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.5 An association of periodontitis with systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases6 and preterm birth,7 has also been suggested, because the DNA of periodontal pathogens, including Pre. intermedia, has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques.8 In addition, the anti-Pre. intermedia IgM titre in umbilical cord blood is significantly higher in preterm infants than in full-term infants.9The virulence factors of Pre. intermedia, such as adhesins,10,11 proteolytic enzymes12 and lipopolysaccharides,13 have been investigated, but its pathogenicity has not yet been fully elucidated. Three Pre. intermedia genome sequences, namely those from strains 17, ATCC25611 and ZT, are available, and an intra- and inter-species genomic comparison was previously performed to obtain information regarding the conservation and variation in the gene contents.14 However, the complete genome sequence, which may provide more precise information on the genome structure, gene content, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) ,and repetitive elements and therefore a deeper understanding of the evolutionary process of bacteria, has only been determined for strain 17.In this study, we determined the complete sequences of two chromosomes in Pre. intermedia strain OMA14 and performed a fine comparison of the fully sequenced genomes of strains OMA14 and 17. Our analysis revealed an unusual amplification of conjugative and mobilizable transposons (CTns and MTns) and identified a novel repeat specific to a sublineage of the genus Prevotella, which was named ‘Pre. intermedia–nigrescens group-specific repeat’. These MGEs and repeats were found to be deeply involved in the genomic rearrangements and the generation of the variability in the gene contents detected between the two genomes, particularly those associated with the second chromosome. These data will expand our understanding of the genetic features of Pre. intermedia and provide novel insights into the evolutionary process through which this bacterium has adapted to and survive in the stressful and variable oral habitat.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing and sequence analysisThe strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Prevotella intermedia OMA14 was isolated from a periodontal pocket of a Japanese patient with periodontitis, and strain 17 was also isolated from a human periodontal pocket.15 The Prevotella strains were cultured anaerobically (10% CO2, 10% H2, and 80% N2) on trypto-soya agar (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 0.5% brain–heart infusion, 0.1% cysteine, 5 µg/ml hemin, and 0.5 µg/ml menadione. Cells were harvested after 1 day of culture on trypto-soya agar plates to prepare genomic DNA as described previously.16The Pre. intermedia OMA14 genome was sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium platform (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). In total, 363,377 single-end reads (150 Mb) were assembled into 85 contigs using the GS Assembler software version 2.6. For gap closing, a fosmid library was constructed using a Copy Control Fosmid Library Production kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gaps were closed through the sequencing of gap-spanning PCR products and fosmid clones using an ABI3130xl DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). To correct sequencing errors, the OMA14 genome was resequenced using the SOLiD (Applied Biosystems) and MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) platforms. The candidate sequence errors were then confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The accuracy of sequence assembly was confirmed by optical mapping (Hitachi Solutions, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).Protein-coding sequences (CDSs) were identified and annotated using the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (http://www.migap.org/)17 followed by manual curation using additional information obtained by a search of the Pfam protein family database (pfam.xfam.org).18 CDS numbers headed by ‘PIOMA14_I_’ or ‘PIOMA14_II_’ were assigned to each CDS on the large and small chromosomes, respectively. The Ori-Finder program19 was used to find oriC using the Escherichia coli DnaA boxes and one unmatch site option. The GenomeMatcher program20 was used to define the conserved genomic regions, inversions, and translocations between the two genomes using the bla2seq comparison at sensitivity 500 and 95% nucleotide identity threshold. The CD-HIT Suite for Biological Sequence Clustering and Comparison (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi)21 was used to identify orthologous CDS clusters (with cut-offs of >60% minimal alignment coverage and >90% sequence identity). The annotated genome sequences of strain OMA14 have been deposited into the DDBJ/NCBI/EMBL database under the Accession Numbers AP014597 and AP014598.2.2. PCR assay for the excision of CTns and MTnsPrimer pairs were designed to amplify the attachment site-containing regions of the excised and circularized forms of each CTn and MTn (we refer to attachment sites on CTns and MTns as ‘attTn’ in this manuscript) and the attB regions of each cast-off genome (Supplementary Table S2). PCR amplification was performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA and an LA Taq PCR kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following temperature program: 94°C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 2 min. The amplified fragments were subjected to direct sequencing on an ABI PRISM 3130xl sequencer to determine the nucleotide sequences of the attTn- or attB-flanking regions.2.3. Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeat-specific PCRThe Pre. intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeat (PINSR)-specific primers PINSR-F and PINSR-R (Supplementary Table S2) were designed from the consensus sequence of PINSR. The expected product length was 149 bp. PCR amplification was performed with 50 ng of genomic DNA and an Ex Taq PCR kit (Takara Bio) using the following temperature program: 94°C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 51°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The amplified products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide straining. As a control, the 16S-rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 16S-rRNA-10F and 16S-rRNA-800 (Supplementary Table S2).3. Results and discussion3.1. General features of the Pre. intermedia genomesSimilar to the genome of Pre. intermedia strain 17 and the other fully sequenced genomes of Prevotella species (Prevotella denticola and Preotella melaninogenica), the genome of OMA14 consisted of two circular chromosomes with sizes of 2,280,262 and 867,855 bp (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The large and small chromosomes of strain 17 were designated Chromosome II and Chromosome I (Accession No. NC_017861, NC_017860), respectively. However, to avoid confusion, we refer to the large and small chromosomes of both strains in this manuscript as the first and second chromosomes, respectively. The first nucleotide positions of the first and second chromosomes were assigned to the first nucleotides of the dnaA gene (PIOMA14_I_0001) and the initiation factor 3 gene (PIOMA14_II_0001), respectively. The first chromosome of OMA14 is larger than that of strain 17 (2,280 kb versus. 2,013 kb), and the second chromosome showed a more striking variation in size, namely 868 kb in OMA14 and 579 kb in strain 17 (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This variation is mainly due to the insertion of more MGEs into the second chromosome of OMA14 than into that of strain 17, as described in the next section. In both strains, although clear GC skew transitions were not detected in the second chromosome, clear transitions were observed at two loci located at opposite sites on the first chromosome. These two loci are located at analogous regions between the two strains. One of the loci (positions 1,498,452–1,498,927 in OMA14) contains multiple DnaA boxes and was predicted to be oriC of the first chromosome by Ori-Finder. Thus, this locus and the opposite locus most likely represent the replication origin and terminus of the first chromosome, respectively, but the dnaA gene is not located near the former locus. We have confirmed in the phylum Bacteroidetes, the oriC region is commonly located far from the dnaA gene (DoriC: an updated database of bacterial and archaeal replication origins, http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/).22 PIOMA14_II_0001 on the second chromosome encodes a protein belonging to the Rep_3 superfamily. This may suggest a possibility that the second chromosome has a plasmid-type replication system. But, we did not find any genes related to plasmid maintenance and iteron-like repeat sequences in the vicinity of this CDS. Therefore, the replication origin and terminus of the second chromosome are currently unknown.

In both strains, three and one rRNA operons are present in the first and second chromosomes, respectively. A full set of tRNA genes specifying all 20 amino acids was identified in both strains, i.e. 48 and 50 genes in strains OMA14 and 17, respectively. These tRNA genes are distributed to both chromosomes, but the tRNASer genes (two copies) are encoded only on the second chromosome in both strains. A similar, small chromosome-specific distribution of specific tRNA genes has been observed in other Prevotella species with two chromosomes: tRNACys and tRNALys in Pre. dentalis (Accession No. NC_019960, NC_019968) and tRNAAsp, tRNAGlu, and tRNASer in Pre. melaninogenica (Accession No. NC_014370, NC_014371). In addition to the rRNA operons and tRNA genes, the second chromosome of Pre. ntermedia contains many CDSs for house-keeping functions, including multiple ribosomal proteins (S1, L27, L28, and L33), multiple DNA polymerase III subunits (beta, gamma/tau, and epsilon), the RecA and RecN proteins, NADH dehydrogenase, NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase, prolyl-tRNA synthetase, heat-shock protein 90, and transcription termination factor Rho. Our preliminary analysis of other fully sequenced Prevotella species, Pre. dentalis and Pre. melaninogenica, indicate that many essential house-keeping genes are located in their second (smaller) chromosomes (ribosomal protein genes, chaperon protein genes, and many others). These data indicate that in Prevotella species, genes that are essentially required for cell growth are distributed in both the large and small chromosomes.Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) were also found in both chromosomes but only the locus on the first chromosome contains CRISPR-associated genes. In OMA14, the numbers of repeats in the repeat/space regions of the CRISPR-47-29 locus on the first chromosome and CRISPR 36-30 locus on the second chromosome were 33 and 6, respectively, whereas the analogous regions in strain 17 contain 38 and 17 repeats, respectively. Notably the cas1 gene of strain OMA14 has been disrupted by the insertion of a 34.2-kb phage-related segment, resulting in the apparent inactivation of the CRISPR system in OMA14. Smaller numbers of repeats in both loci of strain OMA14 (compared with strain 17) may be associated with the inactivation of the CRISPR system in this strain.3.2. Mobile genetic elementsOne of the notable genomic features of Pre. intermedia is the abundance of MGEs, particularly CTns and MTns (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S3–S5). Thus, we conducted a detailed analysis of these MGEs in strains OMA14 and 17.In total, 14 and 27 IS elements (including partial copies) were identified in strains OMA14 and 17, respectively. These elements were classified into two types, namely ISPi1 and ISPi2, and both types are distributed to both chromosomes and are more abundant in strain 17 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). ISPi1 is closely related to ISPg3 found in Por. gingivalis, sharing the same inverted repeat sequences and generating the same length of target sequence duplication (7 bp) upon transposition. ISPi2 was assigned to the IS4 family by IS finder (https://www-is.biotoul.fr/)23 using the tblastx program and default settings.OMA14 contains 6 CTns and 15 MTns, whereas strain 17 possesses 2 CTns and 7 MTns (including highly degraded MTns; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). These transposons account for 14.6 and 4.8% of the total genomes of OMA14 and strain 17, respectively. In addition, CTns and MTns occupy large portions (20.5%) of the second chromosome, particularly in OMA14, which is one of the main driving forces responsible for the marked difference in the size of the second chromosomes between the two strains. The CTns and MTns identified were classified into four (CTnPi1–CTnPi4) and 10 types (MTnPi1–MTnPi10), respectively. Among these, one type of CTn and two types of MTns are shared by the two strains, suggesting that these CTn and MTns may be widely distributed among Pre. intermedia strains. Several copies found in OMA14 (CTnPi2-a and -b; MTnPi1-a and -b; MTnPi2-a, -b, -c, and -d; and MTnPi3-a, -b, and -c) are nearly identical and thus appear to have been very recently duplicated (Fig. 2).

Some CTns or MTns (indicated by underlining) were found in strain 17, and others were found in strain OMA14. The CDSs are depicted by arrows (striped arrow, genes related to conjugation or mobilization; black arrow, integrase genes; grey arrow, other functionally annotated CDSs; and white arrow, genes for hypothetical proteins). The black triangles indicate the att sites of each CTn and MTn. Three att sequences (attL of MTnPi6-a, attL of MTnPi7, and attR of MTnPi9) were predicted based on the sequence homology to the consensus att core sequence of MTnPi1, MTnPi2, and MTnPi3 (see Supplementary Table S3). CTn and MTn transposons lacking either one of att sequences can be regarded as the remnants. The grey shading indicates homologous CDSs with >70% amino acid sequence identity.

A double line indicates a degraded integrase gene.Both CTnPi1 (found in OMA14) and CTnPi4 (strain 17) belong to the CTnPg1 family, which was originally identified in Por. gingivalis,16 and share a set of backbone genes for integration- and conjugal transfer-related functions with other family members, which have been identified in Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Bacteroides species, all belonging to the order Bacteroidales (Supplementary Fig. S1). Both CTns, particularly CTnPi4, carry various accessory genes. Some of these genes are distributed in other CTnPg1 family members, e.g. genes for an ABC transporter component and a glycine C-acetyltransferase (CTnPi1) in the family members found in Por. gingivalis TDC60 and Pre. endodontalis ATCC 35406 and genes encoding an ABC transporter component, a TonB-dependent receptor, and several other proteins (CTnPi4) in the members found in Pre. nigrescens ATCC 33563 and Prevotella buccae D17. These results suggest that accessory genes are frequently exchanged between CTnPg1 family members.CTnPi2 and CTnPi3, both of which are found in OMA14, are closely related to one another, sharing a conserved backbone encoding integration- and conjugal transfer-related functions, which are partially homologous to those of CTnPi1 and CTnPi4 (Fig. 2A). CTnPi2 and CTnPi3 contain multiple integrase genes in internal regions. There are no putative att sequences just upstream of those internally residing integrase genes, but these integrases contain the motifs conserved in functional tyrosine recombinases. It is possible that the two CTns were generated by the insertion of at least one integrative element similar to MTns, i.e. one element in CTnPi2 and two or three elements in CTnPi3 with one shared by the two CTns. As accessory genes, CTnPi3 carries genes for a type I restriction-modification system and a tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein as well as genes that are shared with CTnPi2 (encoding an ABC transporter component and a TonB-dependent receptor).MTns are a group of transposons that contain an oriT sequence and can thus be mobilized by a co-resident conjugative plasmid or transposon.24 Among the 10 types of MTns identified in the two strains, only degraded copies were found for several types (MTnPi5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). However, genes for relaxase, a primase family protein, and integrase, which are required for MTn function, were found in most types (Fig. 2B). Because the integrases of all MTns are tyrosine recombinases, they all belong to type I MTn.24 MTnPi1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 appear to be related to one another and share similar relaxases, primase family proteins, and integrases. MTnPi4 and 8 and MTnPi5 and 10 appear to form different groups, respectively. A unique feature of this group is the presence of two integrase genes located in tandem, although the second gene (a downstream copy) is missing or degraded in some MTn copies. The two integrase genes in each MTn show no significant homology to one another (see the next subsection for a discussion of the functions of these two integrases). It was previously reported that Tn1806 of Streptococcus pneumonia AP200 also contains two int genes in tandem.25 The other four MTns may be classified into two groups: one including ‘MTnPi4 (found in OMA14) and MTnPi8 (strain 17)’, and the other including ‘MTnPi5 (OMA14) and MTnPi-10 (strain 17)’, because each pair shares similar genes for a primase family protein, relaxase, or integrase. Most MTns also carry one or more accessory genes, such as those encoding an ABC transporter component, a LuxR family transcriptional regulator, a subtilase-like protease, a ß-lactamase family protein, and an arginase.In general, CTns/MTns are integrated into a specific target site (attachment site; att) that contains a short sequence specific to each CTn or MTn. Upon integration, the att sequences are duplicated and form chromosome/CTn (or MTn) boundaries (attL and attR), which are good landmarks for the definition of each CTn/MTn. However, it is not always easy to identify att sequences. Therefore, we used PCR assays to detect the excised and circularized intermediates of each CTn and MTn and thereby examined whether the identified CTns and MTns are excised from the chromosome (Fig. 3A). In addition, through a sequencing analysis of the PCR products, we determined the att sequences of each CTn/MTn (attTn on the excised and circularized forms of transposon and attL and attR at chromosome/transposon boundaries). Through this series of analyses, we found that CTnPi1, 2, 3, and 4 and MTnPi1, 2, 3, and 4 are constitutively excised from the chromosome to form a circular intermediate (Fig. 3B), and we identified their att sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Data). Among these CTns and MTns, multiple copies of CTnPi2 and MTnPi1, 2, and 3 were found. Because the sequences of attTn-flanking regions in the different copies are identical, it was impossible to determine which copy is excised in each type of transposon. We therefore performed an additional PCR assay to detect the chromosomal attachment sites (attB) of each copy from which CTn/MTn has been excised (Fig. 3A and C). This analysis confirmed that all of the copies, with the exception of one copy of MTnPi1 and one copy of MTnPi3, were excised from the chromosome. These results suggest that these CTns and MTns are likely active. We speculate that they can potentially transfer (or be transferred) to other bacteria, but conjugation assays for each transposon need to confirm their activities. We were unable to detect the excision of the remaining MTns (data not shown), which was expected for six of the MTns (MTnPi5–MTnPi10) due to their high degree of degradation.

Agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products obtained by the primer pairs left/right (B) and up/down (C). The attTn-containing regions in CTnPi-4 and MTnPi1-c were amplified from strain 17. The other regions were amplified from OMA14. attTn indicates the att sequence on the excised and circularized form of transposon.Notably, MTnPi1-c was not excised (Fig. 3B), which was rather unexpected, because this element contains all of the genes found in other MTnPi1 copies except for the second (downstream) integrase (Fig. 2). The integrase of MTnPi1-c has been significantly diverged in sequence from the upstream integrase of MTnPi1-a and MTnPi1-b (92.7% amino acid sequence identity). This makes a sharp contrast to the fact that the upstream integrases of MTnPi1-a and MTnPi1-b are identical in amino acid sequence. Although the motif for tyrosine recombinase is conserved in the integrase of MTnPi1-c, amino acid substitutions have accumulated in the C-terminal region. Inactivation of the integrase by these amino acid substitutions may be a possible reason for the failure of excision of MTnPi1-c. However, the apparent and specific deletion of the downstream integrase gene from MTnPi1-c suggests another possibility that both integrases may be required for their function, at least for the excision of MTnPi1. If this is true, two integrase genes in MTnPi2 and MTnPi3 would also be required for the excision of these MTns, because their integrases show high sequence similarities to those of MTnPi1 (Fig. 2).In addition to allowing the exact definition of chromosome/CTn (or MTn) boundaries, the analysis of the identified att sequences/sites yielded several important findings. CTnPi1 and CTnPi4 use the same 13-bp sequence (TTTTCNNNNAAAA) that used by other CTnPg1 family members as its attachment site, supporting our conclusion regarding the relationship of these two CTns to the CTnPg1 family obtained from the previous structural comparison (Fig. 2). Second, CTnPi2-b, CTnPi3, and MTnPi4 are inserted into tRNA genes, similar to several other CTns24 and MTns.26,27 Another copy of CTnPi2-a is inserted into an integrase gene (II_0226) that may form part of a degraded MTn similar to MTnPi1 and MTnPi2. Notably, MTnPi1, 2, and 3 use similar 11-bp sequences as the att site, supporting the close relatedness of these MTns that was inferred from the previous structural comparison (Fig. 2).3.4. Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeatWe found a 188-bp incomplete repeat sequence located in intergenic regions in the genomes of both strains OMA14 and 17 (Fig. 4A). This repeat sequence was expanded to 177 copies in OMA14 and 184 copies in strain 17 (Supplementary Table S6). A database search for homologous sequences confirmed that this 188-bp repeat is also present in the downstream region of the tnaA gene28 and DNA probe Pig2729 of Pre. intermedia ATCC 25611 and the draft genomes of Pre. nigrescens ATCC 33563 and F103. We further examined 18 Prevotella species (Supplementary Table S1) for the presence of this repeat by PCR using primers specific to the repeat, which were designed based on the consensus sequence deduced from all copies found in strains OMA14 and 17 (Fig. 4A). This analysis revealed that, in addition to Pre. intermedia and Pre. nigrescens, Prevotella falsenii and Prevotella disiens also contain the repeat (Fig. 4B). These four species are closely related and form a clade in the genus Prevotella (Fig. 4C).30,31 Although some species in this clade lack the repeat, none of the Prevotella species belonging to other clades apparently possess the 188-bp repeat. We therefore named this repeat PINSR (Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens group-specific repeat). The selective distribution of PINSR in the Pre. intermedia/nigrescens group suggests that PINSR was acquired by a common ancestor of this group and then amplified in some species (particularly Pre. intermedia) or deleted (or diverged in sequence) from other species following speciation. PINSR-specific PCR would thus be useful for identifying Pre. intermedia and the three other PINSR-possessing Prevotella species. Prevotella intermedia–nigrescens group-specific repeat (PINSR).

Species, the complete genome sequences of which are available in public databases, are indicated by open circles. Only the species indicated by triangles were examined for the presence of PINSR by PCR.In addition, small CDSs that overlap PINSR were annotated in the genome sequence of strain 17 (Accession No. NC_017860, NC_017861). However, clear ribosome-binding sequences are not present in most cases, and no significant homology to known proteins was detected. The sizes of these small CDSs are highly variable. Therefore, it is most likely that PINSR does not contain protein-coding sequences. PINSR also does not contain terminal-inverted repeat sequences. Therefore, PINSR is distinct from the miniature-inverted repeat transposable element (MITE) that is transposable by the action of the transposase provided in trans from a cognate IS element. Intriguingly, approximately three-quarters of the PINSR-containing regions identified in strains OMA14 and 17 are conserved between the two strains, suggesting that PINSR may have been amplified prior to the separation of the two strains. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that most strain-specific regions, such as CTns and MTns, in both strains do not contain PINSR. Although PINSR apparently played some roles in the genome rearrangement that occurred between the two strains, as described in the next section, further studies are necessary to elucidate the biological functions and source of PINSR (if present).3.5. Genome rearrangementA whole-genome sequence alignment analysis revealed that extensive genomic rearrangements have occurred between strains OMA14 and 17. We identified 26 inversions/translocations and >100 simple insertions/deletions (Supplementary Fig. S3). Approximately two-thirds of the identified inversions/translocations are associated with MGEs, and at least one IS, CTn, or MTn element is present at each inversion/translocation site. The remaining inversions/translocations occurred between PINSRs, rrn operons, or tRNA genes. This analysis also identified strain-specific segments (>10 kb) in both genomes, namely Segments A-W in OMA14 and Segments A-I in strain 17 (the sixth circle in Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). Approximately half of these segments simply consist of a single CTn or MTn (10 of the 23 segments in stain OMA14 and 4 of the 9 segments in strain 17). However, several segments, particularly larger ones, exhibit composite natures containing multiple MGTs. Furthermore, several segments contain phage-related genes and thus likely represent prophages or degraded prophages. These features further support the hypothesis that MGEs played key roles in generating the genomic diversity of Pre. intermedia.3.6. Gene repertoire comparison between the two Pre. intermedia strainsTo compare the gene repertoires of strains OMA14 and 17, we performed a clustering analysis of all CDSs identified in the two strains using the CD-HIT program, which generated 2,884 CDS clusters. Among these, 1,744 were found to be conserved in both strains, whereas 686 and 454 are specific to strains OMA14 and 17, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4). This number of conserved genes is somewhat larger than that recently revealed by the comparison of the genome of strain 17 and draft sequences of two Pre. intermedia strains (~1,600).14 This difference may be due to the difference in the number of strains analysed and to the difference in the quality of the sequences or annotations (complete versus. draft sequences). Therefore, the core genome of Pre. intermedia most likely consists of 1,600–1,700 genes and encodes most virulence genes that have been identified in Pre. intermedia, such as proteolytic enzyme interpain A (II_0221)12 and the adhesins AdpC (I_1236)10 and AdpF (I_1057).11 The gene set encoding the type IX secretion system (T9SS), which was originally identified in Por. gingivalis,32,33 was also found in the core genome.The strain-specific CDSs listed in Supplementary Tables S9 and S10 include many genes in CTns and MTns, reflecting the difference in the transposon repertoires between the two strains. In particular, as many as 54.4% of the CDSs on the second chromosome of strain OMA14, where CTns and MTns are most densely integrated, are strain-specific CDSs. Notably, each strain contains a large number of strain-specific genes related to DNA restriction modification. Another noteworthy finding is the presence of strain-specific glycosyltransferase gene clusters in each strain (Segment D in OMA14 and Segment G in strain 17), which suggests that the two strains may produce different extracellular polysaccharides.3.7. ConclusionsIn this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of Pre. intermedia OMA14 and compared it with the completely sequenced Pre. intermedia strain 17. Our analysis revealed that the genomes of Pre. intermedia are unusually enriched in CTns and MTns, which account for large parts of the strain-specific sequences observed in each Pre. intermedia genome. Together with IS elements, these CTns and MTns are also involved in the extensive genomic rearrangements observed between the two strains. In addition, we found a novel repeat element (named PINSR) that has been extensively amplified in Pre. intermedia and several Prevotella species belonging to the Pre. intermedia–nigrescens group. These results expand our understanding of the genetic features and genomic diversity of Pre. intermedia and provide novel insights into the roles of MGEs, particularly CTns and MTns, in the evolution of bacteria.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas ‘Genome Science’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (No. 221S0002), and by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. 20249073 and No. 24659817) to K.N.

In this report, detailed gene structures of barley, whole genome shotgun (WGS) and additional transcript data of the cultivar Haruna Nijo were quality controlled and compared with the published Morex genome information. Haruna Nijo scaffolds have longer total sequence length with much higher N50 and fewer sequences than those in Morex WGS contigs. The longer Haruna Nijo scaffolds provided efficient FLcDNA mapping, resulting in high coverage and detection of the transcription start sites. In combination with FLcDNAs and RNA-Seq data from four different tissue samples of Haruna Nijo, we identified 51,249 gene models on 30,606 loci. Overall sequence similarity between Haruna Nijo and Morex genome was 95.99%, while that of exon regions was higher (99.71%). These sequence and annotation data of Haruna Nijo are combined with Morex genome data and released from a genome browser. The genome sequence of Haruna Nijo may provide detailed gene structures in addition to the current Morex barley genome information.1. IntroductionBarley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is used for many purposes including human food, malting and animal feed. Coupled with its wide adaptability in environments ranging from the highlands of Africa at the equator to the Arctic Regions in Scandinavia, barley is the fourth most important cereal crop (http://faostat.fao.org, 7 November 2015, date accessed). In addition, barley is an ancient crop that was domesticated ca. 10,000 yrs ago in the Fertile Crescent.1 Decades of collection and curation of barley germplasm have resulted in substantial germplasm collections including: IPK (Germany), USDA-ARS (USA) and Okayama University (Japan).2 To fully exploit these in situ and ex situ collections for barley breeding and gene discovery, barley genome sequences of multiple genotypes are needed.To generate the first genome sequence of barley, the International Barley Sequencing Consortium (IBSC) conducted BAC fingerprinting, BAC end sequencing, whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, RNA-Seq analysis and genetic mapping and integrated these data to develop a gene-based genome sequence of the North American six-row spring malting barley cultivar Morex.3 Morex traces to barley germplasm of Manchurian origin with six-row inflorescence, which is not common for malting barleys other than the USA. Currently, Morex is the reference genome for barley genetics studies, and additional efforts are in progress to improve the Morex genome sequence.4,5 Three other barley genomes including Bowman, Barke and a Tibetan hulless genotype have been WGS sequenced3,6 and provide additional sequence information for comparison to Morex.Haruna Nijo is a Japanese malting barley cultivar exhibiting excellent malting quality for brewing beer. Historically, Japanese malting barleys have been developed by crossing European malting barley cultivars and Japanese landraces and selecting for malting quality and adaptation to Japanese environments. Haruna Nijo was also developed by this approach in 1979 and has been extensively used as a foundation genotype of current Japanese breeding. Haruna Nijo has a high thermostability of ß-amylase,7 and it also shows different Bmy1 allele for ß-amylase activity from Morex.8 It is also shown that Haruna Nijo has a high malt extract (related to beer production) by QTL analysis.9 To enhance the utility of Haruna Nijo for breeding, a suite of genomics resources were developed including: an EST collection, transcript map construction,10,11 a BAC library,12 454-based WGS sequencing3 and full-length (FL) cDNA sequencing and analysis13,14 (available at http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/bexdb/, 7 November 2015, date accessed, with functions of expression profiling and genome browsing).In the case of barley genome resources, the Morex reference genome and the Haruna Nijo FLcDNA sequences provide unique resources in different genotypes. Thus, to enhance the utility of both resources they need to be compared and integrated. Sequence comparisons of the two different malting barley haplotypes will be much more useful than single haplotype information, as they provide the basis of structural and functional allelic diversity. Previous comparisons of WGS data and FLcDNA sequences from Haruna Nijo and the genome sequence from Morex demonstrated a large amount of sequence polymorphisms between the two genotypes.3 For example, the genetic distance (dissimilarity) between Morex and Haruna Nijo by 1,536 SNPs of Illumina GoldenGate Assay is 0.50, which is larger than the difference (0.48) between Morex and Akashinriki (Japanese food barley).15 Thus, the Haruna Nijo FLcDNA and WGS sequences may provide useful gene annotations for the reference genotype Morex and a resource for future breeding and gene discovery activities.Our overall goal is to provide genome information of Haruna Nijo to annotate gene structures on the genome sequence of Morex. The four specific objectives of this study were to (i) generate high-quality genomic sequence of Haruna Nijo, (ii) map the precise position of genes identified in the Haruna Nijo genome, (iii) compare gene information between Haruna Nijo and Morex, and (iv) develop gene models based on the Haruna Nijo sequence data.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and nucleic acid isolationFor DNA and RNA isolation from seedling tissues, seeds of Haruna Nijo were germinated on moist filter paper in Petri dishes at 20°C in the dark. For DNA isolation, shoots of ca. 5 cm were harvested and high-quality genomic DNA was isolated by DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN K.K., Japan). For RNA isolation, seedling shoot and seedling root tissues were sampled from plants exhibiting 5 cm shoots. For the RNA samples from immature spike and immature seed samples, barley seeds were planted in pot with soil mixture (N: 120 mg l-1; P: 100 mg l-1; K: 160 mg l-1, pH 5.5) and grown in the greenhouse at 20/15°C day/night temperature under natural light conditions. Immature spike samples were harvested from the leaf sheath 5 days before heading. Immature seeds were sampled 35 days after flowering (soft dough stage). Total RNA from immature seeds was isolated by TRIzol® Reagent (Life Technologies, Japan) following the Plant RNA Isolation protocol. All RNA samples were purified by RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN K.K., Japan), and DNA was removed by RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN K.K., Japan).2.2. Library developmentThe high-quality genomic DNA was fragmented in 8 k and 20 k by the Hydroshear (Digilab Inc., Holliston, MA, USA). The library was developed by a library preparation kit (Roche diagnostics, Japan) for long paired-end libraries (8 k and 20 k). Circularization was performed according to the Roche Paired End Library Protocol, using Roche circularization adapters (Paired End Library Preparation Method Manual 20 kb and 8 kb Span; Roche Diagnostics, October 2009, Steps 3.1–3.7.3). Subsequently, the circularized fragments were fragmented again by nebulization to develop a sequencing library.DNA (2 µg) was fragmented by nebulization. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction ‘Preparing Samples for Paired-End Sequencing, Part # 1005063 Rev. A June 2008’ of TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Japan). DNA fragments were size selected (500 bp) following the Low-Throughput Protocol of TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Japan). The quality of the library (fragment length distribution) was checked by Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Agilent Technologies, Japan) and KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KK4835, Kapa Biosystems, MA, USA).Libraries for RNA-Seq analysis were developed from each RNA sample using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit V2 (Illumina Japan). The protocol of TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation V2 Guide (Illumina Japan) was used with modification of fragment isolation from agarose gel electrophoresis and elution in EB (elution buffer) following the method in the TruSeq Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina Japan). The library was quantified with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies Japan) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies Japan).2.3. SequencingEach library was emulsion PCR amplified. The PCR-amplified fragments on beads were washed, and the bead number was counted using a Coulter Counter Z1 single threshold instrument (Beckman Coulter Japan). The appropriate number of beads was applied on a pico titre plate according to the manufacturer's protocol. The FLX Titanium platform was used for sequencing (average read length 500 bp). The pyrosequencing reaction data were base-called to generate sff format files using the software installed on the analysis server of the 454 sequencer (Roche diagnostics, Japan).The shotgun library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to produce 2 × 101 paired-end reads. Raw data processing, base calling and quality control were performed with manufacture's standard pipeline. The quality of the output sequences was inspected using the FastQC program (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/, 7 November 2015, date accessed).The RNA-Seq library was sequenced with MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (2 × 300 bp cycles) on MiSeq NGS system according to the MiSeq System User Guide (Illumina Japan) and fastq files were generated from both ends of the fragments.2.4. Assembly, sequence trimming and repeat maskingIllimina PE reads, 454 single-end reads and 454 long paired-end reads were hybrid assembled by the de novo assemble algorithm of CLC Assembly Cell ver. 3.2.2 installed on a linux server with a main memory of 256 Gb.Human, fungi (33 species) and microbial (2,777 species) nucleotide sequence data were obtained from NCBI. Each assembled contig sequence was queried on sequences of these species, and the contigs showing >80% identity and >50% of cumulative coverage by blastn16 were assumed as alien sequences against the barley genome. For repeat masking, fasta files of Triticeae repeat sequence database (TREP Release 10: n = 1,717) were downloaded from GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/Repeats/, 7 November 2015, date accessed). In addition, new repetitive elements were generated from the Haruna Nijo genome assembly by RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html, 7 November 2015, date accessed). These two libraries were used for repeat masking the Haruna Nijo assembly by censor17 with -mode norm mode. For the analysis of repeat distribution, only results of repeat masking by the TREP library were used. For comparison, genomes of Triticum aestivum,18Triticum urartu19 and Aegilops tauschii20 were repeat masked in a similar manner as the Haruna Nijo genome.2.5. FLcDNA/RNA-Seq mappingOf the two independent projects,13,14 5,006 FLcDNAs were retrieved from NCBI13 and 23,614 FLcDNAs14 were downloaded from the bex-db (http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/bexdb/).21 Morex genome assembly (contigs) was retrieved from the PGSB PlantsDB database (http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/plantsdb.jsp, 7 November 2015, date accessed).3 FLcDNAs were mapped both on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and on the Morex contigs using blast+ with the parameters ‘-task blastn -evalue 10e-10 -lcase_masking’, and with est2genome22 in the EMBOSS package with the parameters ‘-align –mode both -gappenalty 8 -mismatch 6 -minscore 10’. FLcDNAs mapped to scaffolds with >95% identity and >50% coverage were accepted. Mapped regions with the highest identity were adopted for each FLcDNA. Overlapped FLcDNA sequences were clustered onto a locus on Haruna Nijo genome.After trimming of low-quality nucleotide and adapter sequences by Trimmomatic,23 reads derived from rRNA sequences were discarded by Bowtie2.24 A set of programs, Bowtie2,24 TopHat225 and Cufflinks,26 were used to map reads on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Gene structures derived from FLcDNA mapping were utilized to develop consensus gene models of the four library reads. To predict ORFs on the gene structures, blastx searches were conducted to RefSeq and UniProtKB data sets. From the best hit of blastx results, the most reliable ORFs were determined with at least 70 amino acids in length. To assign gene function, InterProScan 527 was conducted on the predicted ORFs. Based on the InterPro domain, GO terms were assigned to each ORF, and GOslim28 (http://agbase.msstate.edu/cgi-bin/tools/goslimviewer_select.pl, 7 November 2015, date accessed) was conducted.From the silva database29 (http://www.arb-silva.de/, 7 November 2015, date accessed), 17 barley rRNA sequences were downloaded. They were mapped on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds using blast+ with the parameters ‘-task blastn -evalue 0.01 -lcase_masking -num_descriptions 100’ and blast hits with >98% identity and >50% coverage were assumed as rRNAs. tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.3.1 program.30 Any tRNAs that were annotated as ‘possible pseudogenes’ were not counted.The Haruna Nijo scaffolds were mapped on the Morex contigs using megablast with the parameters ‘-evalue 10e-10 -num_descriptions 5’. Since several query sequences were hit on the same target sequence, the best hit regions were identified. If more than one Morex contig was positioned on a Haruna Nijo scaffold, these contigs were aligned on the scaffold allowing 10% overlap of the contig sequences.High confidence (HC) and low confidence (LC) genes of Morex were downloaded from the PGSB barley genome database and mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds by GMAP31 with >95% identity and >90% coverage.3. Results and discussion3.1. Assembly of the Haruna Nijo genome sequenceWe analysed different platforms of WGS sequences of Haruna Nijo by hybrid assembly. A total of 305 Gbp of sequence data were generated by Illumina HiSeq paired-end reads and 454 Titanium long paired-end reads (8 K and 20 K) (Table 1). The hybrid assembly of Illumina and 454 reads, which also include the published 454 Titanium single-end reads (25Gbp),3 generated a total of 2,055,601,874 bp in 1,753,384 scaffolds (contigs and gaps). After sequence trimming, the Haruna Nijo genome size was 2,005,970,762 bp in 1,712,236 scaffolds (Table 2). The N50 was ~3.5 kb, which is 2.5 times larger than the published Morex WGS contigs.3 The average sequence length in the Haruna Nijo scaffolds was longer than the Morex WGS contigs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Compared with Morex WGS contigs, which were assembled with only Illumina paired-end reads, the longer Haruna Nijo WGS assembly is likely due to assembling the Illumina paired-end reads and 454 longer single-end reads. Sources of WGS sequencing data for Haruna NijoSources of WGS sequencing data for Haruna NijoResults of whole-genome assembly of Haruna Nijo and Morex3Results of whole-genome assembly of Haruna Nijo and Morex33.2. Repeat content of the Haruna Nijo genomePrevious studies have shown that the barley genome contains ~80% repeated elements.3 In the published WGS assemblies,3 the relative frequency was reduced to ~60%, due to the degradation of redundant repeated sequences. On the assembly of Haruna Nijo WGS data, repeat analysis by the Triticeae repeat library (TREP) detected 55.9% as repeated sequences. After deleting unknown genomic regions (‘N’ sites), 60.8% of the assembled sequences were classified as repeated sequences. The composition and distribution of repeat sequence categories were similar between Haruna Nijo and Morex (Fig. 1). Noteworthy, Gypsy, Copia retrotransposons and the CACTA DNA transposon showed higher frequencies than those normally observed in other Triticeae species. When we compared repeat categories from Haruna Nijo, T. aestivum (common wheat) cv. Chinese Spring, T. urartu and A. tauschii, the frequency of Copia in Haruna Nijo was higher than those in the wheat genomes, while Haruna Nijo contained more CACTA and less Gypsy than those in wheat genomes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Distribution of TREP repeat categories on the Haruna Nijo and Morex barley genome assemblies. Frequency of each repeat content was calculated by the result of repeat masking using the TREP library. Total bases of each repeat region on the genomes were divided by those of all repeat regions.Distribution of TREP repeat categories on the Haruna Nijo and Morex barley genome assemblies. Frequency of each repeat content was calculated by the result of repeat masking using the TREP library. Total bases of each repeat region on the genomes were divided by those of all repeat regions.To identify unique repeat sequences in barley, de novo repeat sequences in the Haruna Nijo scaffolds were detected by RepeatModeler, which identified a total of 979 consensus sequences. The de novo repeat library and the TREP library were used for repeat masking. As a result, 74.8% of the assembled sequences were masked (‘N’s were not masked and thus deleted from the calculation). The repeat masking by the de novo library identified 68.1% repeat sequences, which were much more than the masked repeats (60.8%) detected by the TREP library.3.3. FLcDNA mappingFLcDNA mapping on genome sequence provides reliable exon vs. intron structures on gene models. A non-redundant set of 28,620 FLcDNA sequences13,14 was mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Blastn mapping revealed that 27,784 FLcDNAs (97%) showed sequence similarities with the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. According to the results of the FLcDNA mapping to scaffolds, we analysed mapping coverage of 5'-end of each FLcDNA on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. The ratio of completely mapped FLcDNAs, which were mapped from the first nucleotide sequence, was <10%. This shows that most of the FLcDNAs do not have the complete sequences on the 5'-end side exon. To analyse additional mapped FLcDNAs, we relaxed the mapping position to the first 10 nucleotide sequences. Then, the ratio of mapped FLcDNA was raised to 80% (Supplementary Fig. S3). GC contents and CG-skew were analysed on the FLcDNAs having mapped 5'-ends within 10 bp. The typical high GC contents and CG-skewed peaks at the transcription start sites were identified as previously observed in rice and Arabidopsis32 (Supplementary Fig. S4).The longer Haruna Nijo scaffolds may contribute to the efficiency in FLcDNA mapping. The number of mapped FLcDNAs under the threshold of 50% mapping coverage was 26,240 in the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and 24,261 in the Morex contigs (Table 3). These numbers included FLcDNAs that mapped to either the Haruna Nijo scaffolds (1,985) or the Morex contigs (379). However, if the threshold of mapping coverage was raised to 95%, the number of mapped FLcDNAs decreased to 14,044 on the Morex contigs, while 19,485 were still mapped on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. FLcDNA mapping on genome assembliesFLcDNA mapping on genome assembliesWe also analysed the coverage of FLcDNA mapped reads on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and the Morex contigs by comparing the mapped exon numbers of FLcDNAs between Haruna Nijo and Morex. Of the 24,255 FLcDNA gene models, 19,207 (79.2%) were mapped with the same number of exons both on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and on the Morex contigs. Of these, 3,066 gene models had more exons in Haruna Nijo than that in Morex, while 1,982 gene models had more exons in Morex than Haruna Nijo. The start position analysis also showed that the Haruna Nijo scaffolds (6,842) had more mapped 5'-end sequences than the Morex contigs (1,721).These results indicated that the available genome sequences of Morex and Haruna Nijo are different, and there may be more cases where FLcDNAs mapped with higher coverage on Haruna Nijo genomes. For example, the entire FLcDNA (AK371953) for the cleistogamy1 (cly1 for closed flowering) gene,33 which was mapped on a Haruna Nijo scaffold, while the 5' region was not mapped on a Morex contig (Fig. 2). Moreover, flanking regions for the FLcDNA (3.6 Kb for upstream and 2.9 Kb for downstream regions) were present on the Haruna Nijo scaffold to provide the opportunity to analyse the cis-element(s) of the gene. Gene structure of closed flowering locus cly1 (AK371953). In the Haruna Nijo genome, the complete gene structures of cly1 including upstream and downstream regions were identified. In the Morex genome,3 the first exon and upstream regions were truncated because of insufficient length of the contig.Gene structure of closed flowering locus cly1 (AK371953). In the Haruna Nijo genome, the complete gene structures of cly1 including upstream and downstream regions were identified. In the Morex genome,3 the first exon and upstream regions were truncated because of insufficient length of the contig.3.4. Gene annotationThe IBSC presented 26,159 HC (high confidence) and 53,220 LC (low confidence) gene models by using RNA-Seq-based transcript and FLcDNAs.3 This number of genes was larger than that of the Haruna Nijo FLcDNAs. Actually, of the 24,243 HC Morex gene models (in GFF file), only 7,645 had corresponding Haruna Nijo FLcDNAs, indicating that the FLcDNAs sequence data were not deep enough to construct a comprehensive set of barley gene models. To obtain more comprehensive transcript sequences of Haruna Nijo, RNA-Seq data from four libraries of seedling shoot, seedling root, immature spike and immature seed were collected (Table 4). As reference gene structures, 26,240 gene models on 18,226 loci determined by FLcDNA mapping with 50% coverage (Table 3) were used for mapping RNA-Seq reads. Sequences of each RNA-Seq library mapped 73.2–81.0% to each other, indicating that the concordant pair alignment rates were not much different among the libraries (Table 4). Sequences from all four libraries were combined by cuffmerge26 and 30,606 loci (51,249 gene models) were estimated. Of these, 12,390 loci and 5,635 alternative variants were added on the Haruna Nijo gene models. Sequencing and mapping results of Haruna Nijo RNA-Seq dataSequencing and mapping results of Haruna Nijo RNA-Seq dataWe compared the Haruna Nijo gene models with the Morex HC and LC gene models.3 We mapped 78.0% of Morex HC gene models and 72.2% of Morex LC gene models on Haruna Nijo gene models with 95% coverage and 90% identity. Of these, 1,446 Morex gene models were mapped on multiple Haruna Nijo gene models. Clustering analysis showed that 21,381 Haruna Nijo gene models overlapped with Morex gene models on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds, while 9,225 gene models did not overlap each other.Blastx search on RefSeq/UniProt showed that 48,619 gene models of Haruna Nijo were similar to known protein sequences. In addition, 48,105 predicted ORFs on 28,422 gene models of 24,467 scaffolds were >70 aa in length. Of these, 44,133 ORFs had Met at the start positions. Noteworthy, 23,882 ORFs derived from 25,897 mapped FLcDNA contained Met at the start position.InterProScan analysis showed that 26,956 ORFs on 19,438 loci contained 67,293 InterPro domains. While 2,760 InterPro domains were in the ‘REPEAT’ category, which may not have biological function, other 44,769 domains were ‘DOMAIN’ category (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, GOslim analysis revealed that the gene content of Haruna Nijo (barley) and Nipponbare (rice) was quite similar (Supplementary Fig. S5).We also predicted rRNA genes on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Based on the silva database, nine scaffolds were identified as rRNA regions. In the case of rice, rDNA genes compose nucleolar-organizing region (NOR) in which rDNA are aligned in tandem. In wheat, the chromosome-based WGS analysis showed that the chromosome 6B contains 60% of the total rRNA gene (5,500 genes).34 However, these regions could not be assembled by NGS data35 due to the degeneration in the process of assembly. This was also true for the Haruna Nijo scaffolds which showed only nine scaffolds carrying rRNA sequences. The difficulty of assembling NOR was also reported in rice,36 but the NOR assembly in WGS might be more difficult in general.tRNAs were also annotated by tRNAscan-SE. The spectrum of tRNA distribution across the genome was uneven but similar to the rice genome37 (Supplementary Fig. S6). It is reported that tRNALys sequences are extraordinarily abundant in wheat chromosome 6B due to the abundance of the retrotransposon Gypsy.35 The Haruna Nijo scaffolds also have higher rate of Gypsy; however, the number of tRNAs was smaller than that in wheat.3.5. WGS assembly comparison between Haruna Nijo and MorexThere are several published3 and ongoing efforts of sequencing BACs derived from Morex. BAC-based assemblies may provide longer sequences than WGS assemblies to estimate gene models on the genome. The final goal for developing Haruna Nijo gene models is to map them on the BAC-based Morex genome sequences. To understand the quality of current Haruna Nijo genome resources, sequences of the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and the Morex contigs were aligned by megablast. An average sequence identity between Haruna Nijo and Morex was estimated as 95.99% (Supplementary Table S2). We found that mapped regions of query were different when query and database sequences were exchanged between Haruna Nijo and Morex. This was caused by the difference of sequence length in two assemblies. In this analysis, we used the best hit of megablast for the calculation, and the other hits with lower coverage on Haruna Nijo scaffolds were discarded. Therefore, the total length of aligned regions was decreased. Genome comparison of Haruna Nijo and Morex identified the occasions that the genomic regions of Haruna Nijo and Morex do not match. An example of mismatch between two assemblies on chromosome 5H was that a region of the Haruna Nijo gene model of TCONS_00033948 or TCONS_00033949 (Fig. 3A), which is supported by a FLcDNA, AK370496 that encodes bZIP transcription factor family protein on a contig_55003 (scaffold), was divided into two loci of MLOC_14578.1 on morex_contig_156845 (Fig. 3B) and MLOC_75543 on morex_contig_68185 (Fig. 3C). Thus, we may find a better gene model if we compare multiple gene models derived from different assemblies.

Separated genomic regions of Morex which correspond to the single FLcDNA region in Haruna Nijo.

The difference between Haruna Nijo scaffolds and FLcDNA sequences was 0.05% (1 bp of 2000bp in exon), which is still five times higher than the value of 0.01% in rice genome.37 However, the sequence difference of exon regions between Haruna Nijo and Morex (identified by Haruna Nijo FLcDNAs) was 0.29%, indicating that the sequence quality of scaffolds in Haruna Nijo was high compared with the haplotype difference between Haruna Nijo and Morex.3.6. ConclusionBased on this study, there are several advantages of using the Haruna Nijo sequence resources. The Haruna Nijo scaffolds provide a high-quality genome sequence for the barley research community. In particular, the FLcDNA sequences, which are available only for Haruna Nijo, provide a key resource. In addition, the gene structures of Haruna Nijo provide supplementary data sets to the Morex genome sequence. Finally, the haplotype of Haruna Nijo is popular among the malting barley cultivars in the world and can be used as an alternative source of alleles for important traits in barley.4.

IntroductionSince the completion of the first genome sequence of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana,1 next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have facilitated genome sequencing and construction of reference genome sequences of many important crops.2 The reference genome sequences provide valuable information for understanding genomic variation and genome evolution. Based on the utility of reference genome sequences, detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has become a valuable tool for genomic selection in plant molecular breeding due to their genome-wide abundance. Accordingly, rapid and inexpensive SNP detection methods are required for genotyping large and diverse germplasm collections or breeding populations. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is one such highly efficient method for genome-wide SNP detection with relatively low cost and time demands, because genome-wide reduced representation sequencing is conducted using NGS technology.3An important strength of GBS is that discovery of huge numbers of markers and genotyping of those markers occur simultaneously. GBS has been applied for construction of high-resolution genetic maps, association study for agricultural traits, and genomic prediction for development of breeding materials using populations of interest in several crop species, such as maize,3–5 soybean,6 barley,3,7 rice,8 and wheat.7 Finally, the SNP data deduced from GBS analysis can be used for genomics-assisted breeding. GBS approaches have largely been applied to crops with well-sequenced reference genomes. In further, GBS approach successfully adapted for genetic mapping without reference genome sequences.9Brassica oleracea is one of the three basic diploid Brassica species belonging to the evolutionary U's triangle10 and is an economically important vegetable crop consumed worldwide. Brassica oleracea shows extremely diverse morphology and includes vegetables such as cabbages, broccoli, cauliflowers, kohlrabi, kalian, and kales. Recently, two reference genome sequences of B. oleracea were reported; two reference pseudochromosome sequences, of 385 and 447 Mb, were independently built by positioning and ordering of de novo-assembled scaffold sequences using 1,227 PCR-based markers11,12 and 15,909 GBS-based markers,13 respectively.Clubroot is a devastating disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae that results in severe losses of yield and quality not only in cabbage but also in other Brassica crops.14 The pathogen induces gall formation on the root, leading to suppressed transport of nutrients and water, and finally abnormal growth and yield loss.15 Because the pathogen can survive in soil as resting spores without host plants for long periods, it is difficult to control by cultural practices or chemical treatments.16 Therefore, development of cultivars with clubroot resistance (CR) has been considered the most effective method to minimize yield loss caused by clubroot disease.In B. rapa, at least eight race-specific CR loci have been introduced from various European fodder turnips,17 and the markers for Crr1, Crr2, Crr3, Crr4, CRa, CRb, CRc, and CRk18–21 have been identified in five different chromosomes. To increase efficiency in marker-assisted selection (MAS), fine mapping was carried out for each locus in several B. rapa studies.22–25 In contrast to B. rapa, completely resistant accessions have only rarely been identified in B. oleracea.17,26 In B. rapa, the CR traits are controlled in a qualitative27,28 and quantitative manner20,21,29 depending on genotypes studied, whereas genetic studies suggest that CR are controlled by many minor QTLs in B. oleracea.17,30 DNA markers linked to CR loci in B. oleracea have been developed by several research groups, but most of these studies did not disclose specific sequence information for the various marker types. To establish a CR breeding system in B. oleracea, it is important to identify the major CR genes active to various CR races.In this study, we generated large-scale marker data sets using GBS analysis of 80 plant samples. The robust SNP marker sets developed in this study were valid for construction of a high-density genetic map and for QTL mapping of CR traits. In addition, the resulting high-resolution linkage map provided valuable information for identification of incorrectly anchored scaffold sequences and further improvement of reference genome assembly for B. oleracea. Finally, the QTLs identified herein, and the genetic map will be valuable for B. oleracea crop improvement.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsTwo cabbage (B. oleracea L. var. capitata) inbred lines, C1176 and C1220, were selected as parents to develop a mapping population. The two lines show different susceptibility to clubroot disease caused by P. brassicae; C1176 is susceptible, whereas C1220 is resistant. The mapping population consisted of 78 F2 plants generated by crossing between C1220 and C1176. The 78 F2 plants were vernalized and self-pollinated to produce F3 progenies for CR tests. All plant materials examined in this study were obtained from Joeun Seeds Co. (Chungcheongbuk-Do, Korea).Genomic DNAs from parental lines and F2 plants were extracted from 2 g samples of young leaves, following the modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol.31 The quality and quantity of the DNA were examined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA).2.2. Library construction and sequencingGenomic DNAs of all 80 plants (two parents and 78 F2) were double digested with two different restriction endonucleases, ApeKI and MspI. The former recognizes a 5-bp sequence (GCWGC) and creates a 3-bp overhang, while the latter recognizes 4-bp sequence (CCGG) and creates a 2-bp overhang. A set of barcode adapters that recognize ApeKI-compatible sequences with variable barcode sequences (4–9 bp) for each different plant and a set of common adapters that recognize MspI-compatible sequences were ligated to the digested DNA of each plant. A total of 40 plant samples were pooled as a batch for further library construction steps, such as PCR amplification with adaptor-specific primers, and sequencing on two single lanes of Illumina Hi-seq 2000. DNA digestion, adapter ligation, library construction, and sequencing were carried out by Macrogen Co. (Korea).2.3. Raw sequence data processing and SNP genotypingRaw paired-end (PE) sequences were filtered based on criteria for sequence quality and length using the program clc_quality_trim V4.3.0.114910 (http://www.clcbio.com). Sequence reads that had <20 in sequence quality score and 50 bp of sequence length were removed, and then barcode sequences were eliminated. Filtered reads, which were ~93 bp on average, were aligned to the reference sequences of B. oleracea var. capitata homozygous line 02–12 (02–12 reference genome) reported by Liu et al.12 using the Burrows–Wheeler alignment tool (BWA)32 with default parameters, and properly paired reads were sorted by the parameter of maximum insert size (800 bp). Read grouping and removal of PCR duplicates were done using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net). Genome analysis toolkit (GATK) was used to perform local realignment of reads to correct misalignments due to the presence of INDELs. Finally, UnifiedGenotyper,33 which is one of the utilities in the GATK package, was used for detection of SNPs and calling of SNP genotypes. Additional filtering and genotyping processes were carried out with user-friendly option changes in the web-interfaced GBS Genotyping Pipeline, and the final genotype data were graphically displayed using GBS Browser (http://www.phyzen-lab.com/oleracea) developed by Phyzen Genomics Institute (Korea).2.4. Molecular marker analysisWe analysed 32 markers for genotyping as position markers for comparison with the GBS genotyping results: 2 EST-based dCAPS, 9 whole-genome resequencing-based dCAPS,34 3 EST-SSRs,35 16 genomic SSRs,20,36–40 and 2 polymorphic markers based on miniature inverted transposable element (MITE) insertion polymorphism (MIP)41,42 (Supplementary Table S1). The amplicons of the markers were analysed by visualization on a UV trans-illuminator after electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide using 9% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels or 1% agarose gels depending on amplified fragment size.2.5. Genetic map constructionDetected GBS-SNP markers were grouped and named based on the position on the reference chromosome sequences. Genotype results of all markers were listed for each F2 individual in order of position on pseudochromosomes. The genotyping scores of GBS markers and PCR-based markers were integrated, and linkage analysis and map construction were performed using JoinMap version 4.1 with the same parameters as in previous studies.34,35 Genetic and physical map positions showed the same order for most GBS-SNPs, but some SNPs were assigned different positions between the genetic map and the physical map. When the genetic mapping position of the GBS-SNP did not coincide with the physical mapping at the pseudomolecule reference genome sequence, we considered these differential positions as misallocated. These areas were named as sequence variance blocks (v-blocks) if the positions of genetic map and physical map were differential for more than three contiguous SNPs, and as small variance blocks (s-blocks) if only one or two contiguous SNPs showed different positions between the genetic and physical maps (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Additionally, we divided the pseudomolecule into different blocks if it was interrupted by v-blocks or showed 10–15% recombination between adjacent markers (Supplementary Fig. S1C and B). We labelled each block in alphabetical order, and the information for each block on the reference genome is described in Supplementary Table S2.2.6. Clubroot resistance test and QTL analysisInoculum preparation and resistance tests were performed by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (Daejeon, Korea). Two isolates of P. brassicae, YC and GN, which were collected in Yeoncheon and Gangneung, Korea, respectively, were determined as Race 2 and 9, respectively,43 based on Williams classification.44 The pathogen was inoculated onto roots of Chinese cabbage, and the induced clubs were collected from infected roots and stored at -20°C until needed. For preparation of inocula, the clubs were ground in distilled water using a blender, and homogenized tissue was sifted through four-layered gauze. The resting spore suspensions of YC and GN isolates were diluted with sterile distilled water for inoculation. The final resting spore concentration of YC and GN was adjusted to 1.4 × 108 and 0.4 × 108 spores/ml, respectively.A total of three inoculation tests were performed, two with GN isolate in 2012 and 2014, and one with YC isolate in 2014. All analyses were carried out under the same conditions with 10–15 F2 : 3 plants of each individual F2 line randomly selected for genotyping analysis. The F3 seeds were sown and grown in 5 × 8 plastic pots for 2 weeks in a greenhouse, then the F3 plants were inoculated by applying 5 ml spore suspension at the bottom of the stem base using pipettes. Each plastic pot (40 plants) received 80 ml spore suspension, and the inoculated plants were moved into a dew chamber with the temperature set at 20°C. After incubation for 1 week, the plants were supplied with water from the bottom of the pots for 3 days and then water was withhold for another 4 days. The inoculated plants were transferred to a greenhouse at 20–25°C. The plants were evaluated for clubroot infection 5 weeks after the transfer. After the roots were completely washed, the severity of the clubroot symptoms was scored as follows; 0 = no visible clubs, 1 = a few slight clubs usually confined to lateral roots, 2 = moderate clubbing on lateral roots, 3 = larger clubs in main roots and slight clubs on lateral roots, and 4 = severe clubbing on main roots and lateral roots.A disease index for each F2 individual was calculated as the mean score of 10–15 F3 seedlings. QTLs for resistance against P. brassicae were evaluated using composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis with 0.5 cM scan intervals using the QGene program. CIM was performed with LOD (logarithm of odds) threshold values that were estimated using 1,000 permutation tests at 5% significance.2.7. Comparative analysis of CR lociThe genomes of B. oleracea and B. rapa share a set of 24 conserved chromosomal blocks.45 The complete B. oleracea draft genome also demonstrates generally strong conservation with B. rapa in large segments at the pseudomolecule level.12,13 Based on comparison with the chromosomal block reported in Liu et al.,12 syntenic blocks were compared between B. rapa and B. oleracea. We compared the loci of reported CR genes and QTLs in B. rapa20–23,46,47 and B. oleracea30 to our CR-QTLs, using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST).3. Results3.1. Sequence production and alignmentA total of ~824 million PE reads (83.2 Gb) were generated using the Illumina sequencing platform for 80 plants, with an average of 10.3 million reads per plant sample (Table 1). After removing low-quality reads and barcode sequences, 45.9 Gb of sequence data remained, with an average read length of 93.5 bp. Among 80 samples, the read amounts ranged between 256 and 897 Mb (Fig. 1A). Based on mapping on the 02–12 genome sequence,12 we classified the raw data as discarded reads (because of lack of paired read alignment on the reference genome sequence), unmapped reads, or properly aligned reads. Although the amount of data produced from each plant sample was different, the proportion of discarded reads, unmapped reads, and properly aligned reads was similar for each individual plant (Fig. 1B). In total, 66.4% (30.5 Gb) of the filtered sequence data was mapped on the reference genome, which accounted for an average of 380.9 Mb per each plant. From the mapped sequence, we did not use the reads on multi-copy regions and instead used only unique mapped reads for further analysis, representing 40.5% (a total of 18.6 Gb, which accounted for an average of 232.4 Mb per plant) of raw reads.

SNP discovery and genotypingBrassica oleracea genome underwent whole-genome triplication ~15.9 million yrs ago.12,48 To avoid incorrect genotyping by mismapping of reads in paralogous regions instead of the original position, we used the correctly mapped PE reads for which both reads were uniquely mapped with correct direction and interval on the reference genome. A total of 43,821 SNPs were detected between the two parental lines, and 18,187 of those remained after removing SNPs whose the minimum mapping depth was lower than five (Table 2). The SNPs were distributed throughout the nine chromosomes, with the most SNPs (3,261) on chromosome C03 and the fewest (1,458) on chromosome C02. Summary of SNPs detected between C1220 and C1176aGrouping same genotyping results with adjacent markers.Summary of SNPs detected between C1220 and C1176aGrouping same genotyping results with adjacent markers.Among 18,187 SNP sites, we selected 4,103 SNPs that were genotyped for all 78 F2 plants as the final data set for genetic mapping, to reduce uncertainty of placement potentially conferred by loci derived from missing data. We grouped GBS markers showing the same genotype as genetic bins, or loci, to simplify the genetic map (e.g. the first locus of linkage group C1, C1a-1(7), represents seven GBS-SNPs C1a-1 to C1a-7 in tandem) (Table 2). We noted the number of SNPs and bins per each 3 Mb along the nine chromosomes, revealing biased distribution for SNP density and genetic recombination bins. Generally, SNP density and genetic recombination bins were richer in euchromatic regions near the telomere but rare in heterochromatic regions near the centromere of each chromosome (Fig. 2).

High-density genetic mapping and refinement of two reference genomes sequenceA genetic map was built based on F2 genotyping results of 735 GBS loci represented by 4,103 markers and 32 PCR-based reported markers used for identifying linkage groups (Table 3, Fig. 3). All genotyped markers were allocated into nine linkage groups. Nine linkage groups spanned 879.9 cM with an average distance of 1.15 cM between neighbouring loci. The biggest gap in the genetic map was 15.8 cM in linkage group C02.

Markers in blue (gray) are PCR-based markers and in red (light gray) are loci derived from other pseudochromosomes. QTLs identified in inoculation tests with GN in 2012, 2014, and with YC in 2014 are shown as red (dark gray on C02 and left dark gray on C03), green (light gray), and pink (right dark gray on C03) bars, respectively.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The genetic map displayed overall, but with some exceptions, contiguously collinear marker order, because markers were named based on the backbone of reference genome sequence. All linkage groups included several variance blocks (v- or s-blocks), which showed disordered markers with different order or derived from different chromosomes. Chromosome C05 and C09 had only one v-block, whereas C07 included five v-blocks (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, chromosomes C02, C03, C06, C08, and C09 included at least one s-block. According to our linkage map data, we suggest that all s- and v-blocks likely should be re-allocated into the proper positions. Linkage groups C3 and C9 contained the most complex structure. Both included 11 genetic loci derived from other pseudochromosomes (Table 3 and see the marker names in red in Fig. 3). C3 included 49 GBS markers derived from seven v-blocks, C1-v4, C7-v5, C6-v1, C6-v3, C7-v1, C1-v3, and C2-v2 derived from other chromosomes (Supplementary Table S3). Most s- and v-blocks were assigned to other chromosomes, except C3-v1 and C6-s1 block, which were misallocated into different positions in the original chromosome (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 3).Comparative analysis between the genetic map and the reference genome revealed the new positions for all 27 v-blocks and 10 s-blocks and several inversions of some alphabetically named blocks (Fig. 4A). The positions of GBS markers between chromosomes C04, C05, and C06 and linkage group C4, C5, and C6 suggested that there was less collinearity in those chromosomes than in the other chromosomes. Comparison between the loci in the genetic map and physical position of SNPs in nine pseudochromosomes of (A) 02–12 and (B) TO1000DH genome sequences. Misallocated scaffolds denoted with stars were compared with their corresponding sequences in the other reference genomes (Fig. 7). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Comparison between the loci in the genetic map and physical position of SNPs in nine pseudochromosomes of (A) 02–12 and (B) TO1000DH genome sequences. Misallocated scaffolds denoted with stars were compared with their corresponding sequences in the other reference genomes (Fig. 7). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Based on the relative ratio between physical and genetic distance, possible heterochromatin and euchromatin regions could be inferred (represented by black and red dotted lines between chromosomes and linkage groups, respectively in Fig. 4). Presumed heterochromatin regions from chromosomes C01, C02, C03, C07, C08, and C09 occupied large portions of pseudochromosomes, but showed low frequency of recombination in genetic maps and also low density of SNPs and bins on each pseudochromosome (Fig. 2). Many v-blocks and s-genotyped markers in pseudochromosomes tended to be localized near heterochromatin regions in linkage groups (Fig. 4). Conversely, the regions showing high frequency of recombination (represented by red dotted lines in Fig. 4) were considered as euchromatin.Another cabbage reference sequence was reported by Parkin et al.13 using the kale-like TO1000DH genotype (TO1000DH genome sequence). When we performed GBS read mapping on the TO1000DH genome sequence backbone (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S4), the genetic map consisted of nine linkage groups with 4,338 GBS markers (Supplementary Table S4). The genetic map identified two misanchored sequence scaffolds (v-blocks), which were mapped on the other chromosomes instead of the original position of sequences in the pseudomolecule of TO1000DH genome (Fig. 4B). We compared the v-block sequences in one unique genome with the corresponding sequence in the other reference genome sequence (denoted as star in Fig. 4). Approximately 1.5 Mb sequence of a region (39.5–41.0 Mbp) including the C7-v5 block in 02–12 genome which mapped into linkage group C3 in our map did not show corresponding sequence in chromosome C07 of TO1000DH. However, ~673 Kb of the sequence in that region corresponded to the C3a block in chromosome C03 of TO1000DH (Fig. 5A), which is coincident with our map position (stars in Fig. 4). The remaining ~860 Kb sequence could not be placed due to lack of GBS markers. The two mispositioned scaffolds of TO1000DH were identified in two v-blocks are derived from the heterochromatin regions with rare SNPs and a low recombination rate. Approximately 300 Kb of the C2-v block in chromosome C02 of TO1000DH was not present in the corresponding sequence of 02–12, and the mapping data suggested that the sequence should be repositioned in linkage group C8 (Figs 4B and 5B). Comparison of reference sequences containing V-blocks between 02–12 and TO1000DH genomes. (A) Only flanking sequences of the C7-v5 block in the 02–12 genome, estimated to be in euchromatin regions with abundant GBS markers, were found in the corresponding sequences of the TO1000DH genome. (B) Corresponding sequence of the C2-v block region in TO1000DH, which seemed to be in heterochromatin regions with sparse GBS markers, was not observed in chromosome C02 of the 02–12 genome.

Clubroot resistance assays and QTL analysisThree independent inoculation trials were performed for clubroot resistance, with GN isolate in 2012 and with GN and YC isolates in 2014. The disease index for F2 plants was determined by calculating the average value of the clubroot disease indices obtained from 10–15 F2 : 3 progeny plants in each inoculation test. Disease symptoms caused by YC isolate (Race 2) were much severer than those caused by GN isolate (Race 9) (Fig. 6). The disease symptoms induced by GN isolate were slightly different between the two independent tests in different years, possibly due to different environmental conditions. Disease index distribution of F2 population, evaluated by average scores resulted from inoculated F2 : 3 plants. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Disease index distribution of F2 population, evaluated by average scores resulted from inoculated F2 : 3 plants.

We detected significant QTLs, based on LOD scores higher than the thresholds calculated in the permutation tests; LOD threshold values for the tests with GN isolate in 2012 and 2014 were 2.982 and 2.862, respectively, and the value with YC in 2014 was 2.914. From the two tests with GN isolate, two significant QTL regions were repeatedly detected; CRQTL-GN_1 on chromosome C02 and CRQTL-GN_2 on chromosome C03 (Fig. 3). In the first test, CRQTL-GN_1 had higher values for LOD score, additive effect and variance explained compared with CRQTL-GN_2 (Table 4). The contrary results were detected in the second test. The test with YC isolate identified only a signle QTL region, named CRQTL-YC, which was in chromosome C03 with a location similar to CRQTL-GN_2. CRQTL-YC showed the largest QTL effect, 8.723 LOD score, for clubroot resistance and explained 47.1% of the phenotypic variation (Table 4).

Comparative genetic analysis of CR lociWe next compared the QTL regions identified in this study with reported CR loci in B. rapa and B. oleracea (Table 5). Chromosome C02 harbouring CRQTL-GN_1 exhibited strong collinearity with A02 in B. rapa,12,13 where the CRc gene, the linked marker for which is m6R,21 was mapped (Fig. 7A). In addition, two QTLs in B. oleracea, PbBo(Anju)1 and PbBo(Anju)2 as a major and a minor QTL, respectively, were identified in linkage group O02, which also represents chromosome C02, in Nagaoka et al.30PbBo(Anju)2 is also linked to the m6R marker, and KBrH059L13 and BRMS-228 are the closely linked markers to PbBo(Anju)1. BLAST searches with the m6R marker revealed that that CRc and the PbBo(Anju)2 locus were between the C2b-9(6) and C2b-15(9) GBS markers, which were not included in CRQTL-GN_1. While the position of KBrH059L13 in the reference genome was found near the C2h-5(4) locus, BRMS-228 could not be found in the pseudochromosomes, but rather in unanchored scaffold000122_p2. Therefore, unused reads for alignment on pseudochromosomes were mapped to the scaffold with the same criteria, and two different blocks that showed different genotyping results were detected and named scaffold000122_p2a and scaffold 000122_p2b. A single SNP marker found in scaffold000122_p2b had same genotyping results as the C3-s1 locus (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The region between C2h-5(4) and C3-s1 overlapped with CRQTL-GN_1 (Fig. 7A).

QTL names in red (Pb-Anju1, 2, and 3) were identified in B. oleracea, and CR genes in black (CRa, CRb, CRc, CRk, Crr1, and Crr3) were identified in B. rapa.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Chromosome C03 containing two similar QTLs, CRQTL-GN_2 and CRQTL-YC, show syntenic counterpart regions present in chromosome A03, A06, and A08 in B. rapa12,13 (Fig. 7B). The syntenic region of A03 harbours the loci for Crr3, CRk, CRa, and CRb. The locus of CRa is linked to HC352b sequence,46 and CRb is linked to B4732 and B1005 markers.23 All of those marker sequences could be found near C7-v5 block represented by C7-v5–1(6) in this study. C7-v5-1(6) was also linked to the same locus as C3b-183(20) (Fig. 3). To find the Crr1 locus present in A08, linked BSA7 marker49 sequences were searched in our genetic map, and C3e-19(14) in chromosome C03 was found to be the closest locus. In addition, BrSTS61 marker linked to Crr3 and CRk22 was found in unanchored scaffold000040. Genotyping of SNPs in scaffold00040 revealed that its position could be between C3c and C3d blocks (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The position of BRMS-330 marker linked to PbBo(Anju)330 was found in our QTLs CRQTL-GN_2 and CRQTL-YC, in chromosome C03. Although we could not find the sequence information for BRMS-125, which is linked to Crr4 and contained in A06,20 the syntenic counterpart of A06 to C03 was not related to QTL regions (Fig. 7B).4. Discussion4.1. GBS browser and GBS-based genetic mappingIn a previous study, we identified ~670,000 SNPs between two elite cabbage breeding lines using 20× genome coverage whole-genome resequencing.34 Here, a total of 43,821 GBS-based SNPs were detected between parental lines, 15-fold fewer than detected by resequencing. Although the detection power was reduced, GBS-based genotyping provided a high-density genetic map at low cost in a highly efficient manner.GBS analysis encounters bioinformatic, statistical, and computational challenges, because the large data set is frequently accompanied by a large number of erroneous SNP calling if the data are not properly filtered.8 To find suitable conditions for precise genotyping, the data set generated in this study was analysed under various conditions with various filtering options using a built-in GBS browser. In the browser, we could change the options to optimize the output (Supplementary Fig. S3). The average depth of read mapping was 11×, and we utilized SNPs derived from the regions with 5–100× read mapping depth. We filtered out SNPs derived from reads with <5× coverage to reduce uncertain genotyping due to low-coverage sequences. We also removed SNPs derived from high-depth reads, over than 100× coverage, to alleviate malalignment of reads derived from duplicated genome or repeat sequences. We further changed the criteria for genotyping of heterozygous loci and selected threshold value <0.9. We applied a stringent condition to select high-confidence GBS markers only when a genotype was present in all 80 samples with proper read mapping depth. Afterwards, we validated the genotyping results of the GBS markers by comparison to the genotyping results of 32 PCR-based markers. Consequently, we were able to obtain a high-density genetic map composed of 4,103 SNP markers even though both parental lines are cabbage breeding lines with good agriculture traits and narrow genetic diversity.GBS analysis performed by Parkin et al.13 identified 826 bins in B. oleracea, which was more than identified in this study (679 bins). Our fewer bin numbers are probably due to the difference in genetic diversity of parental lines as well as the number of segregating progeny we used for GBS analysis. We used two elite breeding lines with narrow genetic diversity as parental lines, whereas Parkin et al.13 analysed the population between doubled haploid (DH) kale-like and DH broccoli lines. We also analysed 78 F2 plants for mapping. If we increase the number of F2 individuals for fine mapping, we may identify more recombination bins.4.2. Our GBS-based high-resolution map improves the reference genome sequenceHigh-quality reference genome sequences provide information for identification of genes and regulatory elements, and thus, it is helpful for researchers to understand genomic variation.2 The genomes of A. thaliana8 and Oryza sativa50 were assembled by physical map-based approaches, which involve sequencing of minimally overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and filling gaps by various attempts.51 Thus, the reference sequence covers almost the complete whole genome. However, most of the recent plant genome sequences were primarily assembled by whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategies using NGS technologies.2We performed GBS analysis based on the backbone of two reference genome sequences, 02–12 genome sequence reported by Liu et al.12 and TO1000DH genome sequence reported by Parkin et al.13 to construct a high-density genetic map. The pseudomolecules of 02–12 were constructed based on the genetic mapping of 1,227 PCR-based markers such as SSRs and SNPs.11 The TO1000DH genome sequence was developed by genotyping based on 15,509 GBS-based SNPs for anchoring of scaffold sequences. The TO1000DH genome sequence comprises much larger pseudomolecules (447 Mb) than the pseudochromosomes of 02–12 genome sequence (385 Mb). Here, we utilized 40.5% of the total filtered GBS reads for genotyping by excluding multi-mapped (25.9%) and un-mapped (33.6%) reads. Unmapped reads might be derived from outside of the reference pseudomolecules, probably from unanchored scaffolds or unassembled repeat sequences. In addition, 11.9 Gb of reads (25.9% of data produced in this study) showed multiple hits to the reference sequence, which is probably due to mapping of reads derived from paralogous regions associated with whole-genome triplication events in the Brassiceae tribe52,53 or repetitive sequence regions.We also expected improvement of the 02–12 genome sequence12 by discovery and ordering of unanchored scaffold sequences.54 We were able to position two unanchored scaffolds, scaffold000040 and scaffold000122_p2, which are 2,345,746 bp and 983,585 bp, respectively, into the pseudomolecule (Supplementary Fig. S2). The present 02–12 genome sequence includes ~150 Mb of unanchored scaffolds. In our analysis, >33% of GBS reads were remained as unmapped (Table 1) that could be utilized as guidance for mapping of the remaining unanchored scaffolds, similar to efforts made in barley and wheat genomes.7,54 Likewise, the genome of Drosophila simulans was developed using GBS approach, in which 30% of the unassembled scaffolds were newly assigned to linkage groups.55Furthermore, the 37 and 2 scaffold sequences in v-blocks of the 02–12 and TO1000DH genome sequences, respectively, could be updated via proper repositioning (Fig. 5). The v-blocks are usually derived from repeat-rich and recombination-deficient heterochromatin regions. Comparison of two v-blocks in both reference genome sequences identified the proper position of 673 Kb (C7-v5 block, Fig. 5A) among the 1,533 Kb mispositioned 02–12 genome sequence. The remaining 860 Kb sequence could not be placed due to lack of GBS markers (Fig. 5A). The C2-v blocks in TO1000DH identified ~300 Kb additional sequence that mapped in other C8 chromosome. However, we could not find the corresponding 300 Kb sequence in the 02–12 genome sequence (Fig. 5B). We assume that the lack of corresponding sequence in the 02–12 genome sequence is because this sequence is derived from a repeat-rich heterochromatin region. Moreover, we identified some misordered scaffolds in same chromosome. For example, the C2e block seemed to be within the C2c block, and the C6f, C6e, and C6 g blocks were likely to be inverted (Supplementary Table S3). The benefits of having both genome sequences are innumerable for genomics studies such as this one. Refining and completing the genome sequences is an ongoing task, and our analyses suggest potential errors to address. However, it remains possible that such differences are derived from utilization of different mapping populations in different B. oleracea genotypes with chromosomal-level reorganization.4.3. Clubroot resistance loci differ in the B. rapa and B. oleracea genomesWe identified two QTLs (CRQTL-GN_1 and CRQTL-GN_2) for resistance to GN isolate (Race 9) and one QTL (CRQTL-YC) for resistance to YC isolate (Race 2). Although the LOD values of the two QTLs for GN isolate were different between two tests, both QTLs were detected repeatedly in independent inoculation tests, suggesting that both QTLs are strong candidates for major QTLs against Race 9. CRQTL-YC showed the highest LOD score among all trials and also overlapped with CRQTL-GN_2. This finding implies that the CRQTL-YC locus is probably responsible for resistance against both Race 2 and Race 9. Although resistance to the YC isolate was detected only as a single resistance QTL, we think that the resistance against race 2 is likely controlled by this major QTL, CRQTL-YC, and also affected by many minor quantitative loci, because the disease index distribution of the F2 population did not follow the Mendelian single-gene segregation ratio (Fig. 6).The comparison of genetic loci between our QTLs in B. oleracea and eight CR loci in B. rapa revealed no coincidence in chromosomal positions, even though CRa, CRb, CRk, Crr1, Crr3, and Crr4 in B. rapa are known to be involved in resistance to Race 2,17,21,29,46 the same isolate as YC. Although CRa and CRb in B. oleracea were also reported as resistance genes against Race 2 using swede cv Wilhelmsburger as a resistance source,56 these results raise the possibility that none of the reported CR genes in B. rapa and B. oleracea are related to resistance in our cabbage materials, and that they have a different genetic origin of resistance genes. Because genetic loci for Race 9 resistance have not been identified in either species, our results regarding CRQTL-GN_1 and 2 can provide valuable resources for further research.The Brassicaceae family evolved from rearrangement of shared 24 chromosomal blocks (A–X blocks), which are denoted as the ancestral translocation Proto-Calepineae Karyotype (tPCK). Hundreds of species in the Brassiceae tribe are derived from whole genome triplication of the tPCK, followed by genome rearrangement.52,53,57 The fate of paralogous gene function can be differentiated in other Brassica species. We evaluated paralogous genomic blocks harbouring our QTL regions and compared the blocks to the clubroot resistance loci in B. rapa.Crr3 and CRk were found in the F block, CRa and CRb were found in the J block of chromosome A03, and Crr1 and Crr2 found in the U blocks of chromosome A08 and A01, respectively, of B. rapa. These F, J, and U blocks were not related to our CRQTL regions. The CRc gene was identified in the R block of chromosome A02 of B. rapa, and our CRQTL-YC and CRQTL-GN_2 as well as Pb-Anju3 are identified from the R block of chromosome C03 of B. oleracea (Fig. 6B). It is likely that the paralogous gene of CRc in the R block of chromosome C03 can be the candidate clubroot resistance gene in B. oleracea.Among five QTLs identified in B. oleracea by Nagaoka et al.,30 who used Race 4 for inoculation tests, PbBo(Anju)1, which had a maximum LOD score, and PbBo(Anju)3, regarded as a minor effect QTL, seemed to overlap with CRQTL-GN_1 and CRQTL-GN_2 (or CRQTL-YC), respectively. This, despite the difference in pathogen tested, two overlapping QTLs were identified, suggesting that CRQTL-GN_1 and CRQTL-GN_2 could confer resistance to Races 2, 4, and Races 2, 4, 9, respectively. In the future, cloning of CR genes and QTL analyses using more diverse races are required to characterize the relationship between clubroot resistance and the breeding materials in both B. oleracea and B. rapa.4.4. ConclusionsWe performed GBS for high-resolution mapping using an F2 population between two elite cabbage breeding lines with narrow genetic diversity. We constructed a high-resolution genetic map using 4,103 stringently filtered GBS-SNPs and 32 reference markers. Based on comparison of the high-resolution map and the position of each marker on the reference genome, we identified 37 putatively mislocated scaffolds and their suggested revised positions and also could anchor two unassigned scaffolds, thereby improving the reference genome sequence of cabbage. Moreover, two QTL regions were identified for clubroot resistance against two different P. brassicae isolates. We thus demonstrated that GBS can successfully be applied for rapid genotyping of many individuals for molecular breeding and for genetics and genomics research in cabbage.FundingThis research was supported by the Golden Seed Project (Center for Horticultural Seed Development, No. 213003-04-3-SB430) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) in the Republic of Korea and the Next Biogreen 21 program (PJ01101101) of the Rural Development Administration (RDA) and the Korea Forest Service (KFS).

IntroductionRapeseed (Brassica napus L., AACC, 2n = 38) is one of the most important oil crops in the world. It was grown on 36.5 million ha and produced 72.7 million tonnes of seed worldwide in 2013 (FAO 2013; http://faostat.fao.org/). Rapeseed is used not only as an edible oil but also as an industrial material for lubricants and biodiesel. Brassica napus is a recent allopolyploid species that evolved from natural hybridization between two diploid progenitor species, Brassica rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and Brassica oleracea (CC, 2n = 18), followed by chromosome doubling at least 10,000 yrs ago.1,2 It was domesticated as an oilseed crop only 400–500 yrs ago.3,4 According to the requirements of vernalization, B. napus can be divided into three different growth types: spring type, semi-winter type and winter type.Flowering is an important transition from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage, and correct timing of the floral transition is crucial to ensure reproductive success.5 Flowering time is a complex agronomic trait in B. napus. The potential of rapeseed yield depends to a large extent on flowering time.6 Rapeseed can be widely planted in China, which is the leading country for rapeseed production. One of the main reasons for its widespread growth is that it does not compete with cultivated land for summer crops such as rice and maize. The postponed flowering of rapeseed will affect summer crop planting; hence, flowering time adaptation is a major breeding goal. Currently, understanding of the genetics and molecular regulation of flowering time is mainly based on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In A. thaliana, ~180 genes have been identified for flowering time control.7 Five main flowering control pathways have been found.5 These five pathways are the vernalization pathway and the photoperiod pathway, which control flowering in response to seasonal changes in temperature and day length; the gibberellin pathway, which involves the requirement of gibberellic acid in flowering; the autonomous pathway, which is an endogenous regulation pathway that functions independently of the photoperiod and gibberellin pathways; and the endogenous pathway, which regulates flowering based on the age of the plant. The molecular mechanisms of these pathways have been studied extensively in A. thaliana and several other flowering plants.5Previous studies of the genetic architecture of flowering time in rapeseed were based on QTL linkage mapping using traditional molecular markers, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, simple sequence repeats, intron polymorphisms and sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers in bi-parental populations. Many QTLs related to the flowering time of B. napus have been detected. A total of ~15 QTLs with large phenotypic effects have been mapped, and these QTLs are mainly distributed on chromosomes A2, A9, A10, C2 and C3.8–12 Because B. napus and A. thaliana are cruciferous plants and close relatives, knowledge of genes related to flowering in B. napus is largely based on A. thaliana using comparative genomics. For example, B. napus BnFLC1 is orthologous to A. thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), the key gene in the vernalization pathway,13 and BnCOa1 is orthologous to A. thaliana CO, the core gene in the photoperiod pathway.14Linkage mapping is restricted to allelic diversity and has limited genomic resolution.15 Genome-wide association studies, also called association mapping or linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, can be used to study millions of polymorphisms segregating in natural populations, which can be tested for their effects on a phenotype of interest.16 GWAS was first applied in the study of human diseases.17 With the development of sequencing technologies, GWAS has been successfully applied to the genetic dissection of complex traits in plants, such as A. thaliana,18Oryza sativa,19Zea mays20 and B. napus.21,22 Compared with linkage mapping, GWAS takes less research time, because it is not necessary to create mapping population, and it takes full advantage of ancient recombination events to identify the genetic loci underlying traits at a relatively high resolution.23–25In this study, a diversity panel consisting of 523 B. napus cultivars and inbred lines was genotyped with the Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array. Flowering times of the panel were investigated in eight different environments. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the extent of LD in the population, (ii) dissect the genetic architecture of flowering time in B. napus and (iii) investigate the genetic control of the variation in flowering time in different environments.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and field trialsA diversity panel, consisting of 523 B. napus cultivars and inbred lines, was used for association analysis in this study (Supplementary Table S1). These germplasms originated from 10 countries on 4 continents, and most came from China. These accessions included winter oilseed rape (OSR) (40), semi-winter OSR (433) and spring OSR (44) (Supplementary Table S1). The self-pollinated seeds for each accession were planted in the experimental field with a randomized complete block design of three replications in eight natural environments at five different locations. Each plot contained two rows, with 12 plants in each row and 20 cm between plants within each row and 30 cm between rows. They were sown at the end of September or the beginning of October and harvested the following May. The eight natural environments were E1 (Wuhan; 114.35°E, 30.48°N), E2 (Changsha; 113.09°E, 28.20°N), E3 (Nanjing; 119.18°E, 31.58°N), E4 (Ezhou; 114.90°E, 30.38°N) and E5 (Chongqing; 116.37°E, 40.017°N) in the 2012–13 growing seasons; and E6 (Wuhan), E7 (Chongqing) and E8 (Nanjing) in the 2013–14 growing season. The eight environments were semi-winter growing environment and the winter mean temperatures in the eight environments ranged from 0.8–7.7°C to 4.5–12.2°C (Supplementary Table S2).2.2. Phenotyping and statistical analysisFlowering time data were recorded as the number of days from the sowing day to the day 25% of the plants had at least one open flower in one plot in each environment. Flowering time was investigated for three replicates in E1, E5 and E6 and was investigated for only one replicate in the other five environments. Flowering time of each accession was defined as the average of the three replicates in the same environment. The coefficient of variation of flowering time (FT-CV) was used as a derived trait of environment sensitivity for each accession across the eight environments. FT-2013/2014 is the ratios of flowering times of the 2012–13 growing season to the 2013–14 growing season in the same location. SPSS software was used for the statistical analysis. The best linear unbiased prediction of flowering time (FT-BLUP) for each line in the eight environments was calculated using an R script (www.eXtension.org/pages/61006, 20 November 2015, date last accessed) based on a linear model.262.3. Genotyping and SNP marker filteringGenomic DNA for genotyping was extracted from leaf tissues collected from three plants of each accession by a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.27 Genotyping was performed using the Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array. The SNP data were clustered and called automatically using Illumina BeadStudio genotyping software. The standards of quality control for SNP data were as follows: call frequency =0.8, minor allele frequency (MAF) =0.05 and homozygous genotype frequency cannot be zero. The probe sequences of the SNP array were used to perform a BLAST search against the B. napus Genomes Browser (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/, 20 November 2015, date last accessed). They were regarded as non-specific markers when BLAST matched to two or more locations in the reference genome. SNP markers used for LD analysis and association analysis were filtered with the following steps: (i) non-specific markers were excluded; (ii) markers that were not up to these standards of quality control for SNP data were eliminated; (iii) markers that did not have specific physical location information were excluded. SNPs that were selected for assessing population structure and relative kinship were filtered using the above first two steps.2.4. Population structure, relative kinship and LD analysisSTRUCTURE 2.3.4 software was used to estimate the population structure with a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo model (MCMC). Each K value, as a putative number of populations set from 1 to 10, was obtained with five independent runs. The length of the burn-in period and number of MCMC replications after burn-in were set to 50,000 and 100,000, respectively. The true k value was determined by the log probability of the data (LnP(K)) and an ad hoc statistic <U+0394>K, based on the rate of change in LnP(K) between successive K values.28 The Q matrix was the result of the integration of the cluster membership coefficient matrices of replicate runs from STRUCTURE by the CLUMPP software. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to assess the population structure. PowerMarker version 3.25 was used to calculate genetic distances among varieties by the method of Nei's genetic distances.29 After double centring, distance matrices were used to obtain eigenvectors in NTSYSpc version 2.1. The relative kinship matrix was calculated using SPAGeDi software, and all negative values between two individuals were set to 0. The parameter r2 was used to estimate LD by TASSEL version 4.0. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of the SNP markers was estimated using PowerMarker version 3.25.302.5. Genome-wide association analysisPopulation structure and kinship were used to correct for false positives.31 The association analysis was performed with models by TASSEL version 4.0. The general linear model (GLM) included the naïve model that did not control for population structure and kinship; the Q model controlled the population structure using the Q matrix from STRUCTURE software to identify populations; the PCA model controlled the population structure using the top two principal components (PCs) from PCA to assess populations. The mixed linear model (MLM) included the following: the K model controlling kinship using the kinship matrix from SPAGeDi software to assess inter-individual relative kinship; the Q + K model controlling population structure with the Q matrix and kinship with the kinship matrix and the PCA + K model controlling population structure and kinship using the top two principal components and the kinship matrix, respectively. The Bonferroni test (0.05/number of tests) criterion is typically a very strict threshold;32 therefore, negative log (0.05/n) was used as a threshold for significance of associations between SNPs and traits, where n was the total number of SNPs used in the association analysis. In this study, the threshold was 5.6 (-log (0.05/21,117) ˜ 5.6). Quantile–quantile plots were created with a negative log value of the expected P-value from the genotype–phenotype association and the expected P-value from the assumption that no association exists between genotype and phenotype.3. Results3.1. Phenotypic variationsFlowering times of these accessions ranged from 94 to 202 days, with an average of 160 days across the eight environments, showing extensive variation in the association panel. Flowering times in different environments also showed great variation (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The shortest average flowering times was 151 days in E5, and the longest was 168 days in E8 (Table 1). There were also differences in flowering times of the association panel at the same location in different years. For example, FT-2013/2014 is the ratio of flowering times across pairs of years in the same location. The average values of FT-2013/2014 were <1 in Changsha and Nanjing, and >1 in Wuhan (Table 1). This means that in Changsha and Nanjing, flowering times in 2013 were earlier than that in 2014. However, in Wuhan, flowering time in 2013 was slightly later than that in 2014. These results suggest that flowering time can be greatly affected by the environment.

FT-CV, as a derived trait of environment sensitivity, was used to assess the stability of flowering time in different environments. The results show that flowering times of some accessions were stable in different environments and were not sensitive to environmental factors, whereas other accessions showed instability in flowering times under diverse environments.3.2. Screening of SNPs and LD in rapeseedThe Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array contained 52,157 SNPs. A total of 21,181 SNPs had BLAST matches to two or more locations in the reference genome and were therefore eliminated. In the remaining SNPs, 4,952 SNPs that were not up to the standards of quality control for SNP data were excluded. Finally, 26,024 SNPs were selected for assessing population structure and relative kinship. Of 26,024 SNPs, 21,117 had specific physical location information and were used for LD analysis and association analysis (Supplementary Table S3). These SNP markers were not evenly distributed across the whole genome. C9 had the lowest SNP marker density of one SNP per 77 kb, and A10 and C4 had the highest marker density of one SNP per 20 kb. The mean PIC values of the A subgenome and C subgenome were 0.3052 and 0.2974, respectively, and PIC values for each chromosome ranged from 0.2781 to 0.3219 (Table 2). LD was estimated as r2 (the squared pearson correlation coefficient) between all pairs of SNP markers. In the association panel, the LD decay of B. napus extending over a large distance was 6.5 Mb, where r2 = 0.1. The A subgenome and C subgenome were 1.2 and 7.8 Mb, respectively, and C subgenome LD was significantly higher than that of the A subgenome (Fig. 1A). LD decay ranged from 0.6 to 8.5 Mb among all chromosomes; however, the LD decay distance of chromosome A8 was 5.6 Mb, which was abnormally large compared with values for other chromosomes in the A subgenome (Table 2). These results revealed significant differences in the level of LD between different chromosomes and subgenomes.

Population structure and relative kinshipPopulation structure was assessed by setting possible K values ranging from 1 to 10 with five replicates for each K value using STRUCTURE software. The LnP(K) value increased continuously with the increase of K from 1 to 10, and there was no obvious inflexion point. However, the most apparent change in LnP(K) appeared when K increased from 1 to 2, and the highest <U+0394>K value was observed at K = 2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Hence, the population could be divided into two clusters, P1 and P2 (Fig. 1B). Most lines originated from China, and only 47 lines were from other countries in the association panel. P1 contained 96 lines, of which 25 lines were from Europe and 2 lines were from Canada and Australia. P2 contained 424 lines, of which 10 lines were from Europe, 7 lines were from Japan and Korea and 4 lines had unknown origins. The others were all from China. Most of winter OSR germplasms and spring OSR germplasms were assigned into P2 and P1, respectively. (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, PCA was used to assess genetic variation in the panel. The top two PCs explained 44% of the genetic variation, and P1 and P2 formed clear clusters based on the two PCs (Fig. 1C).The average relative kinship between any two inbred lines was 0.0443 in the panel; ~54% of kinship estimates between lines were equal to 0, and 95% of kinship coefficients ranged from 0 to 0.2. The average pairwise relative kinship coefficient in P2 was 0.0423, and ~96% of the kinship estimates between lines ranged from 0 to 0.2. The average pairwise relative kinship coefficient of P1, however, was 0.2652, which was greater than the values for the total population and P2. In P1, 49% of the pairwise relative kinship coefficients ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 (Fig. 1D). These results reveal that most lines in the panel and P2 had very weak kinship, and there was close kinship in the lines of P1.3.4. Association mappingTo determine which model was more suitable for association mapping in our analysis, FT-BLUP was used to perform the association analysis in six models separately. The six models were as follows: the GLM model, including a naïve model; the Q model; the PCA model, the MLM model, including a K model; the PCA + K model; and the Q + K model. PCA and Q were used to control population structure, and K was used to control kinship. Except naïve model, PCA, Q and K were applied in corresponding models. As seen in the QQ plots (Fig. 2A), observed values had serious deviations from the expected values with the GLM model, which means that there was a high risk of false positives. Observed values were close to the expected values with the MLM model. Compared with the GLM model, the MLM model could better control false positives. Using PCA to estimate population structure was better than using the Q model in controlling false positives. To further control false positives, the PCA + K model was eventually selected for association mapping. Genome-wide association scan for flowering time.

The common significant association signal Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982 is outlined with a vertical dashed line.A total of 41 significant association signals for flowering time were identified with P < 10-5.6 by the PCA + K model in a genome-wide scan. Among the 41 SNPs, 40 SNPs were identified using the phenotypic values in individual environments (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table 3), and 14 SNPs were identified using BLUP values across eight environments (Fig. 2B and Table 3). In total, nine SNPs were detected in more than two environments (Table 3). There was strong LD between two SNPs when their r2 (the squared Pearson correlation coefficient) was >0.75. In our study, these SNPs were considered to be the same QTL. These significant SNPs constituted 35 QTLs, which were distributed on 14 chromosomes across the B. napus genome and explained 5.28–15.75% of the phenotypic variation (Table 3). The summary of SNPs significantly associated with flowering timeaR2 is the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by SNP.The summary of SNPs significantly associated with flowering timeaR2 is the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by SNP.Our research found that the LD decay of B. napus was in a relatively long distance (Table 2), and previous research showed that genome-wide significant associations for B. napus erucic acid content were, respectively, 233 and 128 kb away from the key genes BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC.FAE1.22 In our study, B. napus genes orthologous to A. thaliana flowering time-related genes located within 300 kb of significant SNPs were treated as candidate genes. There were 25 candidate genes identified using this standard. The average r2 ranged from 0.1 to 0.85 in the regions between candidate genes and significant SNPs, and there were 15 candidate genes in high level of LD (r2 > 0.33) with corresponding SNPs associated with flowering time (Supplementary Table S4). The closest distance between the candidate genes and significant SNPs was ~6 kb. Twelve genes were within 100 kb of their corresponding significant signals and included genes orthologous to CO, FLC, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3, and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (Fig. 3). Brassica napus BnaA10g22080D which is orthologous to A. thaliana FLC was within 81 kb of two significant SNPs on A10, Bn-A10-p15022346 and Bn-A10-p15106056. There were four paralogous gene pairs in these candidate genes, which revealed that the QTL containing Bn-A10-p13051361 is homologous to the QTL that contain Bn-scaff_16362_1-p404058, Bn-scaff_16362_1-p385614 and Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4).

Numbers represent the relative distances in the genome, 1 = 1 kb.FT-CV, the CV of flowering times across the eight environments, as an environment sensitivity trait, and FT-2013/2014, the ratios of flowering times between 2 yrs at the same location, as the temperature sensitivity trait, were used to perform the association analysis. There were three groups of data on temperature sensitivity, and no significant signal (-log10P > 5.6) was found in Changsha. Twenty-four SNPs were found to be associated with temperature sensitivity, and six SNPs associated with environment sensitivity were also associated with temperature sensitivity. The most significant SNPs associated with environment sensitivity and temperature sensitivity were found near Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982, located at 43.7 Mb of chromosome C9 (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table S5). Bn-scaff_16362_1-p380982 was also associated with flowering time in E6 (Table 3). Three candidate genes, BnaC09g41980D, BnaC09g41990D and BnaC09g42060D that are, respectively, orthologous to A. thaliana CONSTANS-like 1, CO and AGAMOUS-LIKE 2 were located in 52 kb away from the association signal (Fig. 3). These results reveal that there may be some important adaptation-related genes controlling flowering time near the association signal.4. Discussion4.1. LD in the rapeseed panelIn a population of 192 inbred lines of B. napus, the LD decayed within 0.5–1 cM.33 In another population of 472 rapeseed inbred lines, the longest LD decay was on chromosome C1 with 24,417 kb and the shortest was on chromosome A3 with 294 kb.34 In a diverse panel of 203 Chinese semi-winter rapeseed breeding lines, the LD decay of A subgenome and C subgenome was 0.25–0.30 and 2.00–2.50 Mb, respectively.35 Our study found that the LD decay was 6.5 Mb. Other species show LD decays of 100 kb–1 Mb (rice),36 1–100 Kb (maize)37–39 and 250 kb (A. thaliana).40 These results reveal that the LD decay in B. napus is higher than that in other species, and the evolutionary time and mating system may be the main reasons for this difference. Mutation provides the raw material for producing polymorphisms that will be in LD, and recombination is the main phenomenon that weakens intrachromosomal LD.41Brassica napus is a recent species that was formed ~10,000 yrs ago.1 As such, there has been limited time for B. napus to accumulate more mutations and undergo restructuring events. Furthermore, B. napus is often cross-pollinated; fertilization events are approximately one-third cross-fertilization and two-thirds self-fertilization.42 Self-fertilization causes populations to become composed of homozygous individuals, and high levels of homozygosity limit the effectiveness of recombination.43 The comparatively high resolution provided by association mapping is dependent upon the structure of LD across the genome.24 The high level of LD may make it hard to get a high-resolution result by association mapping. In B. napus, GWAS has been proved to be an effective tool in fine mapping of complex traits in a population which has the level of LD similar to our population.22 However, the resolution provided by association study will be higher in the population with more diverse germplasm bases.The average PIC value of the A subgenome was slightly higher than that of the C subgenome. This result is consistent with the finding that the A subgenome LD decayed in a relatively shorter distance compared with the C subgenome, meaning that the genetic diversity in the A subgenome is higher than that in the C genome. In our association panel, the majority of accessions were from China. Chinese B. napus has been improved by intentional introgression of genomic components from Chinese B. rapa.44 The A subgenome of B. napus is from European B. rapa, and Chinese B. rapa differs from European B. rapa.1,44,45 Therefore, the introgression into B. napus from Chinese B. rapa significantly increased the genetic diversity of the A genome. The LD of chromosome A8 decayed significantly slower than that of other chromosomes in the A subgenome. A similar result was found in previous studies.34BnaA.FAE1, which has been cloned and confirmed as the key gene controlling the content of erucic acid in rapeseed, is on chromosome A8.22,46,47 The strong artificial selection in the process of breeding is probably an important cause of longer LD decay distances on chromosome A8.4.2. Population structure and controlling false-positive resultsThis association population was classified into two subpopulations, but they were not completely separated according to geographical origin. In previous rapeseed association mapping panels, it is also hard to completely separate rapeseed lines according to geographical origin.22,33 Inter-specific crosses and hybridization between diverse germplasms from different countries were used to improve adaptation to the local environment and improve quality after B. napus spread to Australia, Canada, Japan and China.48–50 This spread resulted in introgression between germplasms of different countries. Moreover, there has been limited time for B. napus to undergo domestication after it was spread to different countries. Therefore, it is difficult to completely classify the association population according to geographical origins.The Brassica 60K Illumina Infinium SNP array was developed by an international consortium preferentially using single-locus SNPs identified from genomic and transcriptomic sequencing in genetically diverse Brassica germplasm.51 This approach was designed before the B. napus ‘Darmor-Bzh’ genome52 was released. Brassica napus is an allotetraploid species, with some SNPs from homologous sequence variants (HSVs) and paralogous sequence variants (PSVs). Previous research has found that 87.5–91.2% of the polymorphisms were from homologous genes from the two subgenomes in B. napus.53 HSVs and PSVs will lead to genotyping errors of the association panel, which may cause false positives in subsequent association mapping. Hence, excluding SNPs not in a single MEGABLAST hit by BLAST analysis of probe sequences against the reference genome will eliminate interference from HSVs and PSVs.Genotype–phenotype covariance can lead to spurious associations.54 Many genetic markers appear to be associated with phenotype. In fact, these genetic markers simply capture the genetic relatedness among individuals.55 Flowering time was particularly strongly correlated with geographic origins and population structure in Z. mays and A. thaliana.56,57 The trait and polymorphism(s) were associated very strongly when population structure was ignored, but the association disappeared when structure was considered.57 As described in Fig. 2A, compared with the naïve model, the models making use of Q and PCA to control false positives from the population structure slightly reduced inflation of P-values. The MLM model, including the K model, PCA + K model and Q + K model, can markedly reduce inflation of P-values. Therefore, P-values were serious inflated when kinship was ignored. This indicates that relative kinship within the population probably is one of the major factors resulting in false positives in our association study.4.3. QTLs and candidate genes for flowering time involvementTwelve SNPs associated with flowering time were located in,9,10,12,58–60 and seven SNPs near,9,10 the confidence intervals of QTLs identified in previous studies based on linkage analysis (Supplementary Table S6). There were 11 SNPs allele frequencies that showed significant difference between spring OSR group and winter OSR group (Supplementary Table S7). These SNPs corresponding candidate genes included some important vernalization-related orthologous genes, for example, BnaA10g22080D, BnaA02g08140D and BnaC09g41500D (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S7). BnaA10g22080D was the only candidate gene in the 300 kb range of the three SNPs Bn-A10-p14914898, Bn-A10-p15022346 and Bn-A10-p15106056, and was in the same location as BnFLC.A10.61 There was only one amino acid difference in the amino acid sequences of BnaA10g22080D and BnFLC1, and expression of BnFLC1 in A. thaliana delayed flowering significantly relative to untransformed Ler.13BnaA10g22080D is likely a functional allele related to vernalization. In addition, the remaining SNPs that have not been identified previously in linkage analysis may be novel and important QTLs related to flowering time; they should be verified by other methods in future research.Flowering time is under the control of diverse environmental stimuli, such as temperature and photoperiod.5 The temperature and photoperiod of different regions have significant differences, and there are also significant differences between the temperatures at the same location in different years. Considering the influence of environmental factors on flowering, the dates of flowering time in the eight different environments were separately analysed with association mapping. BLUP minimized the impacts of different locations and years on flowering time, and conversely, the derived trait of environment sensitivity highlighted these impacts. In the same location, the average temperatures of 2013–14 growing season were higher than that of 2012–13 growing season (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, the ratio of flowering times between 2 yrs in the same location was regarded as a derived trait of temperature sensitivity. Six SNPs associated with environment sensitivity were also associated with temperature sensitivity (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table S5). This result suggests that a particular factor affecting flowering times in different years in the same location may have been the major factor that led to differences in the flowering times in the eight environments. Temperature is one of the major environmental factors, but other factors affecting the flowering time could not be ruled out and should be studied in future research. Deep insight into the genetic factors and environmental factors influencing flowering time in different germplasms has a large application potential in rapeseed breeding and cultivation. The BnaC09g41990D orthologue of A. thaliana CO is only 13 kb away from the common significant association signal of environment sensitivity and temperature sensitivity. The temporal and spatial regulation of CO is key to the photoperiod-dependent induction of flowering, and recent research has found that CO protein stability is also affected by temperature.5,62 The TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) proteins interact with the activation domain of CO proteins and inhibit CO activity,63 and expression of TOE1 was reduced at 23°C compared with levels at 16°C.64 CO degradation by HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 1 is increased under low temperature conditions (4°C).65,66BnCOa1, BnCOa9, BnCOb1 and BnCOb9 are orthologous to the Arabidopsis CO gene and were isolated from a pair of homoeologous loci in each of two B. napus lines displaying different flowering times. BnCOa1 has been shown to rescue the co-2 mutation in Arabidopsis.14 BLAST analysis showed that BnaA10g18430D and BnCOa9, and BnaC09g41990D and BnCOb1 have the same amino acid sequences. BnaA10g18430D and BnaC09g41990D were shown to have 98.7 and 94.3% identity, respectively, to BnCOa1 at the amino acid level. Given the above data, BnaC09g41990D and BnaA10g18430D are important candidate genes that may control B. napus flowering time using photoperiod and temperature.FundingThis work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2012AA101107), 948 Program of Ministry of Agriculture of China (2011-G23), the National Basic Research Program of China (2011CB109300) and Natural science Foundation of Hubei province Key program (2014CFA008).

Essentially, the whole-genome resequencing of low and high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals (constituting bulks) from each of these two mapping populations discovered >8 million high-quality homozygous SNPs with respect to the reference kabuli chickpea. The functional significance of the physically mapped SNPs was apparent from the identified 2,264 non-synonymous and 23,550 regulatory SNPs, with 8–10% of these SNPs-carrying genes corresponding to transcription factors and disease resistance-related proteins. The utilization of these mined SNPs in <U+0394> (SNP index)-led QTL-seq analysis and their correlation between two mapping populations based on mQTL-seq, narrowed down two (CaqaPN4.1: 867.8 kb and CaqaPN4.2: 1.8 Mb) major genomic regions harbouring robust pod number QTLs into the high-resolution short QTL intervals (CaqbPN4.1: 637.5 kb and CaqbPN4.2: 1.28 Mb) on chickpea chromosome 4. The integration of mQTL-seq-derived one novel robust QTL with QTL region-specific association analysis delineated the regulatory (C/T) and coding (C/A) SNPs-containing one pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene at a major QTL region regulating pod number in chickpea. This target gene exhibited anther, mature pollen and pod-specific expression, including pronounced higher up-regulated (~3.5-folds) transcript expression in high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals of two mapping populations especially during pollen and pod development. The proposed mQTL-seq-driven combinatorial strategy has profound efficacy in rapid genome-wide scanning of potential candidate gene(s) underlying trait-associated high-resolution robust QTL(s), thereby expediting genomics-assisted breeding and genetic enhancement of crop plants, including chickpea.1. IntroductionChickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most vital food legume with a genome size of ~720 Mb.1,2 The current climatic conditions are adversely affecting the world-wide chickpea productivity to a large extent by highly variable phenotypic plasticity in conjunction with multiple abiotic and biotic stresses, including drought, terminal heat stress, salinity, Fusarium wilt and Ascochyta blight.2–5 Therefore, the primary goal of present chickpea genomics is focused towards minimizing the effect of climate change and biotic/abiotic stresses upon chickpea yield and productivity by developing genetically tailored high-yielding stress-tolerant chickpea cultivars. However, most of the stress tolerance and yield component traits targeted for chickpea genetic enhancement usually have complex genetic architecture and are regulated by multiple major and/or minor genes/QTLs (quantitative trait loci). It is thus imperative to delineate the potential genes/alleles underlying QTLs associated with various traits of interest (yield contributing and stress-tolerant traits) by fine mapping/map-based cloning prior to their effective deployment in marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea. So far, very limited attention has been paid towards fine mapping of trait-regulatory QTLs and their subsequent utilization in marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea.6–13 The narrow genetic base including low marker genetic polymorphism especially between parental accessions of diverse intra-specific mapping populations along with inadequate accessibility of high-density, intra-specific genetic linkage maps are the major bottlenecks in identification and fine mapping of QTLs in chickpea. In this perspective, an alternative genome-wide strategy is crucial for rapid molecular mapping of trait-associated high-resolution QTLs/genes, which in turn will benefit marker-assisted breeding in chickpea.To accelerate molecular mapping of QTLs in chickpea, traditional QTL mapping strategy14–16 that primarily relies on genome-wide discovery and large-scale genotyping of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in individuals of diverse inter-/intra-specific mapping populations (recombinant inbred and near-isogenic lines) by using multiple high-throughput genotyping assays, including NGS (next-generation sequencing)-based GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing) assay, are found to be most fruitful in chickpea.9–13, 17–23 This approach successfully identified a number of low-resolution major QTLs governing various yield contributing (i.e. flowering and maturation time, seed size/100-seed weight, double podding and seed/pod number per plant) and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance traits (viz. salinity and drought tolerance root traits, Fusarium wilt, Ascochyta blight and Botrytis gray mold) in chickpea.1,2, 8–13, 22–41 In light of the added advantages and its broader applicability vis-à-vis the diverse aforesaid traditional QTL mapping approaches, the high-throughput NGS-based QTL-seq has recently been used fruitfully as a cost-effective strategy for rapid genome-wide scanning and mapping of major QTLs governing multiple qualitative and quantitative traits such as seedling vigour and blast resistance in rice, flowering time in cucumber, fruit weight and locule number in tomato, and 100-seed weight in chickpea.42–45 Nonetheless, most of the major QTLs identified through QTL-seq are being localized within sizeable long genetic marker intervals of chromosomes, which requires large-scale validation in multiple mapping populations and subsequent fine mapping through traditional QTL mapping. This will ensure the effective practical utilization of these well-validated robust QTLs/genes in marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea.Simultaneously to expedite the above-mentioned, a multiple QTL-seq (mQTL-seq) approach that involves QTL-seq analysis in multiple mapping populations derived from the common parental accessions could be an attractive genome-wide strategy. Essentially, mQTL-seq deals with NGS-based whole-genome resequencing of DNA bulks (showing two extreme contrasting phenotypic trait values) of progenies that are derived from each of the multiple segregating mapping population with at least single common parental accession (detailed strategy illustrated in Fig. 1). Collectively, the utility of this strategy is evident from the large-scale validation of major QTLs derived from QTL-seq of each preliminary/advanced generation mapping population in diverse genetic backgrounds (multiple mapping populations) along with its efficiency to scale down each QTL-seq originated QTLs into potential candidate genes regulating diverse agronomic traits in chickpea. Henceforth, implementing this mQTL-seq approach can be beneficial for quick genome-wide scanning and fine mapping of trait-associated major genes harbouring robust QTLs (validated in diverse mapping populations) with optimal expense of resources in chickpea. This will provide much needed inputs for molecular dissection of complex quantitative traits culminating into genomics-assisted crop improvement in chickpea at a faster pace.

(C) The <U+0394> (SNP index)-based QTL-seq analysis (following detailed strategies of Takagi et al.42 and Das et al.44) using NGS-genome resequences of parents and bulks from each of the multiple mapping populations to identify major genomic regions that underlie QTLs governing particular agronomic trait in chickpea. The major QTLs identified from each of the multiple mapping populations are localized at varying physical sequence intervals (Mb) spanned by flanking SNP markers on the chromosomes. For instance, QTL-seq analysis in two contrasting pod number mapping populations identified two genomic regions harbouring two major pod number QTLs (PNQTL1 and PNQTL2) that spanned X and Y-Mb sequence intervals between M1 and M2 as well as M3 and M4 flanking SNP markers, respectively, on the same chromosomes.

The integration of QTL-seq-derived two pod number QTLs (PNQTL1 and PNQTL2) identified from two mapping populations enabled to validate these QTLs in two diverse genetic backgrounds to ascertain their robustness for pod number regulation in chickpea. Further, the mQTL-seq analysis scaled-down a longer QTL interval (spanned X Mb) into a shorter pod number robust QTL interval (spanned Y Mb) flanking within M3 and M4 SNP markers on the chromosome; this can serve as a potential target genomic region for rapid identification and delineation of candidate gene(s) regulating pod number in chickpea.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.As a proof of concept, we made an effort to implement an NGS-based genome-wide high-throughput mQTL-seq approach in two F5 mapping populations of C. arietinum and C. reticulatum inter-specific crosses (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 and Pusa 256 × ILWC 46) for identifying the major genomic regions harbouring the robust QTLs associated with pod number per plant in chickpea. The integration of mQTL-seq with QTL region-specific association analysis and differential expression profiling delineated a potential novel candidate gene and natural allelic variants at the major QTL interval governing pod number in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Development of inter-specific mapping populations and their phenotyping for pod numberTwo inter-specific F5 mapping populations of Pusa 1103× ILWC 46 (population size, 102) and Pusa 256× ILWC 46 (population size, 98) derived from high (cultivated C. arietinum desi accessions Pusa 1103 and Pusa 256 with 129 and 120 pods/plant, respectively) and low (wild C. reticulatum accession ILWC 46 with 10 pods/plant) pod number-containing parental accessions were developed using single seed descent method. The wild accession ILWC 46 serves as a common parent for both the populations generated. The mapping individuals and parental accessions of both populations were grown (following random complete block design with two replications) and phenotyped in the real field conditions at two diverse geographical locations of India (CSKHPKV, Palampur: latitude 32.1°N and longitude 76.5°E and NBPGR, New Delhi: 28.6°N and 77.2°E) for two consecutive years. A set of 15–20 representative plants were selected from each mapping individual and parental accession of both populations, and pod number (PN) was measured by counting the average number of fully developed pods per plant at maturity stage. The mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV%), broad-sense heritability (H2) and frequency distribution of PN (based on ANOVA) were measured in both populations individually as per Kujur et al.10,11 and Bajaj et al.23 To determine the trait inheritance pattern, the effects/interactions among accessions/genotypes (G) and environments (E) (i.e. experimental years and geographical locations) were measured. The broad-sense heritability among accessions [H2 = s2g/(s2g + s2ge/n + s2e/nr)] was measured based on s2g (genetic), s2ge (G x E) and s2e (error) variance with n (number of experimental years/environments) = 2 and r (number of replicates) = 2. Additionally, 92 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions representing a PN-specific association panel were also grown in the field and phenotyped for pod number following aforesaid methods.2.2. Whole-genome resequencing and mQTL-seq analysisAccording to the preliminary clues obtained from our traditional QTL mapping analysis, 10 of each high and low pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (a total of 20 individuals) representing two utmost ends of PN normal frequency distribution curve were selected individually from the mapping populations of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 and Pusa 256 × ILWC 46 for QTL-seq analysis. The homozygous genetic constitution of these selected 20 individuals from each of the two mapping populations for either of the high and low pod number trait was ascertained by utilizing their PN field phenotyping information and genotyping data of 96 genome-wide SSR markers in QTL mapping. The isolation and quantification of genomic DNA, pooling of equal concentration DNA to constitute low pod number bulk (LPNB) and high pod number bulk (HPNB), construction and sequencing of pair-end sequencing libraries (100-bp read length) using HiSeq2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) NGS platform and generation of high-quality genomic sequences were performed according to Das et al.44 The BWA with default parameters was used to align and map the high-quality sequence reads onto the reference kabuli genome.46 Subsequently, normalization of the mappable sequence reads based on depth of read coverage among mapping parents and individuals constituting LPNB and HPNB was performed. The high-quality homozygous SNPs (minimum sequence read depth: 10 with SNP base quality =20) between two parental accessions as well as among mapping individuals constituting the LPNB and HPNB were discovered and further structurally and functionally annotated with respect to reference genome as per Kujur et al.12,13A SNP index and <U+0394> (SNP index)-based QTL-seq approach was deployed individually in two mapping populations to scan major PN QTLs in chickpea following the earlier defined recommended parameters.42–45, 47 The <U+0394> (SNP index) was estimated according to subtraction of SNP index (proportion of sequence reads supported the SNPs, which are entirely different from the reference kabuli genome sequences) between LPNB and HPNB. The SNP index was estimated as ‘0’ and ‘1’ based on the representation of genomic fragments derived from Pusa 1103/Pusa 256 and ILWC 46, respectively, in entire high-quality sequence reads generated. A sliding window approach with 1-Mb window size and 10-kb increment was utilized to measure the average distribution of <U+0394> (SNP index) of SNPs physically mapped across eight kabuli chromosomes in a given genomic interval. The SNP index plots were generated for two mapping populations individually by plotting the <U+0394> (SNP index) of LPNB and HPNB and their corresponding SNP index within the specified window size in the graphs. The statistical confidence intervals of <U+0394> (SNP index) with a given sequence read depth under the null hypothesis of no QTLs were calculated to assure the accuracy of QTLs derived from QTL-seq as per Takagi et al.,42 Lu et al.43 and Das et al.442.3. QTL region-specific association analysisThe major genomic regions underlying PN QTLs identified from two mapping populations individually using QTL-seq were compared/correlated to identify the consensus robust QTLs that are well-validated across these diverse populations. One of the selected novel genomic region harbouring robust PN QTL was sequenced in low and high pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (constituting LPNB and HPNB in QTL-seq analysis) and parental accessions from each of the two mapping populations using the multiplexed amplicons sequencing protocol (as per manufacturer's instructions) of TruSeq Custom Amplicon v1.5 in Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. The mapping of high-quality amplicon sequence reads onto the reference kabuli genome and detection of high-quality SNPs among parental accessions and mapping individuals was performed as per Saxena et al.9 and Kujur et al.12,48 The SNPs discovered at the sequenced genomic region harbouring robust PN QTL was structurally and functionally annotated following Kujur et al.12,48 The physically mapped SNPs revealing differentiation between high and low pod number-containing parental accessions and individuals of two mapping populations at QTL region of interest were genotyped in the genomic DNA of 92 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions belonging to a PN-specific association panel using Illumina GoldenGate assay as per Saxena et al.9 and Bajaj et al.23 The replicated multi-location/years PN field phenotyping data, population structure (K = 2) statistics, principal component analysis (PCA) and kinship matrix of 92 accessions were obtained from Kujur et al.13 The association analysis was performed by correlating the genotyping information of SNPs at robust PN QTL interval with aforesaid phenotyping and diversity statistics using general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM at optimum level of compression with P3D method) and mixed model approach of EMMA49 following the methods of Kujur et al.13 and Kumar et al.50 The Bonferroni correction of P-value was used for each trait-associated SNPs at 5% significance level to eliminate the confounding effect of population structure and correct the false discovery rate (FDR) based on multiple comparisons. The informative SNPs-carrying candidate gene associated (R2 = correlation potential of significant SNPs with traits) with PN at significant cut-off P = 10-5 was screened by combining the outcomes of GLM and MLM with EMMA and FDR correction.2.4. Differential gene expression profilingTo infer the gene regulation, differential expression profiling of SNPs-containing gene annotated at the major genomic interval harbouring a novel robust PN QTL (validated by both QTL-seq and QTL region-specific association analysis) was performed. The vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud, ovary, anther and mature pollen) tissues and two-pod (~5 mm beginning pod size at 5–10 days after anthesis/DAA and ~2 cm full pod at 15–20 DAA) developmental stages were collected (at least with three biological replicates) from 40–60 days old healthy plants of low and high pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (constituting LPNB and HPNB in QTL-seq analysis) and parental accessions from each of the two mapping populations under study. The RNA isolated from all the tissues/stages of mapping individuals and parents were amplified with desirable gene-specific primers and internal control elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1a) using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays. The differential expression level of gene observed in diverse tissues/developmental stages of high and low pod number-containing mapping individuals and parents was compared/correlated following Bajaj et al.223. Results and discussion3.1. Genetic inheritance pattern of pod number in two inter-specific mapping populationsWe observed a significant difference of PN (5-237) with 13% CV and 81% H2 in 102 individuals and parental accessions of an inter-specific F5 mapping population of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 (Table 1). A wider phenotypic variation for PN (5-229) with 14.8% CV and 80% H2 was detected in another 98 individuals and parents of an inter-specific F5 mapping population of Pusa 256 × ILWC 46 (Table 1). The continuous variation as well as normal frequency distribution of PN trait was observed in these two mapping populations, which indicates the quantitative genetic inheritance pattern of target trait under study. The pod number is a complex yield component quantitative trait in chickpea, which is known to be governed by multiple abiotic (drought, heat, cold and salinity) and biotic (pod bores and other diseases) stress factors and often influenced by climate/growing conditions. To overcome these intricacies, present study selectively used three contrasting parental accessions-derived inter-specific mapping populations exhibiting wider phenotypic variability and higher heritability (consistent phenotypic expression) for pod number across geographical locations/years for molecular mapping of major QTLs regulating pod number in chickpea through mQTL-seq. Statistical measures of pod number estimated in parental accessions and individuals of two inter-specific F5 mapping populationsStatistical measures of pod number estimated in parental accessions and individuals of two inter-specific F5 mapping populations3.2. NGS-based whole-genome resequencing for QTL-seqThe NGS-based high-throughput whole-genome resequencing of two high and low pod number-containing parental accessions as well as bulks (LPNB and HPNB) of two inter-specific mapping populations [(Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)] were generated on an average of 81.5 million high-quality sequence reads (ranging from 80.7 to 83.5 million reads) with a ~11.6-fold sequencing depth coverage. Notably, 82.1% (varying from 82.3 to 83.6%) sequence reads of these were mapped (minimum mapping quality: 30) to unique physical locations of kabuli reference genome with a 69% mean coverage. The high-quality uniquely mapped sequence reads generated from parental accessions and bulks (LPNB and HPNB) of two mapping populations were normalized based on depth of read coverage to reduce the potential biasness of read depth in the studied samples. Subsequently, the sequencing depth coverage (fold) and genome coverage (%) of uniquely mapped non-redundant sequence reads in mapping parents and bulks were estimated individually, with the average coverage of ~11.6-fold and 64.1% (474.2 Mb) of kabuli chickpea genome (with an estimated genome size of ~740 Mb), respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The normalized individual sequence reads of mapping parents and bulks were compared with reference kabuli genomic sequences (pseudomolecules and scaffolds) to mine the valid homozygous SNPs for QTL-seq analysis. The sequencing data generated in the present investigation was submitted to NCBI-sequence read archive (SRA) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) with accession number SRR2228974 under BioProject ID: PRJNA294404 (submission ID: SUB1081829). The comparative assessment on desi and kabuli draft chickpea genome assemblies provided clues regarding high-quality and uniform whole-genome sequence assembly of kabuli, including its large size (Mb) chromosome pseudomolecule and scaffolds than desi chickpea genome.51 Henceforth, kabuli rather than the desi genome sequence was preferably utilized as a reference for whole-genome resequencing-based SNPs mining and QTL-seq analyses in mapping parents and bulks of chickpea.3.3. Discovery and annotation of genome-wide SNPs in a mapping population of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46The comparative genome sequence data analysis of high (Pusa 1103 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks with reference genomic sequence (pseudomolecule) of kabuli accession (CDC Frontier) identified 243,896 and 234,921 high-quality homozygous SNPs (with read depth =10 and SNP base quality =20) (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, Fig. 2A and B). Of these, 108,170 SNPs irrespective of monomorphic/polymorphic allele types were found to be common between high (Pusa 1103 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks based on their congruent physical positions (bp) on the reference kabuli genome (with a mean map density of 4.8 kb) (Table 2, Supplementary Table S4, Fig. 2A). These selected SNPs were further used for QTL-seq analysis. The 54,731 (50.6% of identified 108 170 SNPs) SNPs were physically mapped on eight chromosomes of kabuli genome with a mean map density of 6.3 kb that varied from 4.3 (chromosome 7) to 9.1 (chromosome 6) kb (Table 2, Fig. 2B). At a genome-wide level, the density of physically mapped SNPs was maximum on chromosome 7 (235.1 SNPs/Mb) followed by chromosome 4 (213.2 SNPs/Mb) and minimum on chromosome 6 (109.9 SNPs/Mb), with a mean of 157.6 SNPs/Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The remaining 53,439 (49.4%) SNPs were mapped on the unanchored scaffolds of kabuli genome with an average map density of 3.2 kb (Table 2). All the 243,896 and 234,921 high-quality homozygous SNPs were submitted to NCBI dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_viewTable.cgi?handle=NIPGR) with SNP submission (SS) accession numbers (1940124817-1945872952; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) for unrestricted public access.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The structural annotation of SNPs exhibited the occurrence of 84,529 (78.1% of total mined 108,170 SNPs) and 23,641 (21.9%) SNPs in the intergenic and different sequence components of 6,179 genes, respectively (Fig. 2D). A maximum (9,280 SNPs, 39.2%) and minimum (1,948 SNPs, 8.2%) frequency of SNPs were observed in the upstream regulatory regions (URRs) and CDS of genes, respectively (Fig. 2E). Notably, 445 and 706 coding SNPs-containing genes exhibited synonymous (666 SNPs) and non-synonymous (1,282 SNPs) (missense and nonsense) substitutions, respectively (Fig. 2F). The non-synonymous SNPs comprise 1,194 missense and 88 nonsense SNPs in the 625 and 81 genes, respectively. The average frequency of SNPs within genes was estimated as 3.8 SNPs/gene. The functional annotation of 6,179 SNPs-carrying genes revealed correspondence of ~9.6 and 8.4% of SNPs to transcription factors and disease resistance-related proteins, respectively. The numerous informative SNPs differentiating desi (Pusa 1103), kabuli (CDC Frontier) and wild (ILWC 46) accessions, structurally and functionally annotated at a genome-wide scale, can be deployed for multi-dimensional high-throughput genotyping applications in chickpea.3.4. Discovery and annotation of genome-wide SNPs in a mapping population of Pusa 256 × ILWC 46We identified 170,032 and 175,796 high-quality genome-wide homozygous SNPs differentiating the high (Pusa 256 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks from reference kabuli accession (CDC Frontier) (Supplementary Table S5 and S6, Fig. 2B and C). Of these, 77,097 SNPs identified to be common between high (Pusa 256 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks following the aforesaid criteria were further used in QTL-seq analysis (Supplementary Table S7, Fig. 2C). All these 77,097 SNPs were mapped on the kabuli genome with an average map density of 6.7 kb (Table 2). The 34,713 (45% of identified 770,987 SNPs) SNPs mined were physically mapped on eight chromosomes of kabuli genome with a mean map density of 10 kb that ranged from 6.7 (chromosome 4) to 13.2 (chromosome 5) kb (Table 2, Fig. 2B). At a whole-genome level, the density of physically mapped SNPs was highest on chromosome 4 (149.1 SNPs/Mb) followed by chromosome 1 (116.7 SNPs/Mb) and minimum on chromosome 5 (75.9 SNPs/Mb), with a mean of 99.9 SNPs/Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The rest 42,384 (55%) SNPs were mapped on the unanchored scaffolds of kabuli genome with an average map density of 4.0 kb (Table 2). All these 170,032 and 175,796 high-quality homozygous SNPs were submitted to NCBI dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_viewTable.cgi?handle=NIPGR) with SNP submission (SS) accession numbers (1945872954–1947070701, Supplementary Tables S5 and S6) for unrestricted use.The structural annotation of SNPs showed the presence of 62,174 (80.6% of total mined 77,097 SNPs) and 14,923 (19.4%) SNPs in the intergenic and various sequence components of 4,175 genes, respectively (Fig. 2D). The URRs and CDS of genes contained maximum (5,557 SNPs, 37.2%) and minimum (1,467 SNPs, 9.8%) frequency of SNPs, respectively (Fig. 2E). Notably, 319 and 475 coding SNPs-carrying genes revealed synonymous (485 SNPs) and non-synonymous (982 SNPs) substitutions, respectively (Fig. 2F). The non-synonymous SNPs contained 909 missense and 73 nonsense SNPs in the 408 and 67 genes, respectively. The average frequency of SNPs within genes was estimated to be 3.6 SNPs/gene. The functional annotation of 4,175 SNPs-carrying genes exhibited that ~7.3 and 5.3% of SNPs were belonging to transcription factors and disease resistance-related proteins, respectively. These functionally relevant SNPs, discriminating desi (Pusa 256), kabuli (CDC Frontier) and wild (ILWC 46) accessions annotated in diverse sequence components of genome/genes, have tremendous practical utility towards establishing efficient marker-trait association and rapid detection of potential genes/QTLs governing important agronomic traits in chickpea.3.5. Molecular mapping of QTL-seq-derived major PN QTLs in a mapping population of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46The SNP index of individual SNPs showing differentiation between high (Pusa 1103 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks was assessed. We estimated an average SNP index across a 1-Mb genomic interval individually in Pusa 1103 and HPNB as well as ILWC 46 and LPNB using a 10-kb sliding window approach. Further, these SNP indexes were plotted against eight chromosomes of kabuli reference genome. The <U+0394> (SNP index) was measured through combining the SNP index information of HPNB and LPNB, and plotted against the genomic positions (Mb) of kabuli reference genome (Fig. 3A). Two major genomic regions (CaqaPN4.1: 13690423 to 14558233 bp and CaqaPN4.2: 31916540 to 33716608 bp) on chromosome 4 demonstrating the average SNP index of higher than 0.8 in HPNB and lower than 0.2 in LPNB were detected (Fig. 3A) following the SNP index estimation criteria as defined in QTL-seq analysis.42–44 The major genomic regions harbouring PN QTLs identified by QTL-seq were assured by <U+0394> (SNP index) value that is significantly different from 0 at 99% significance level. Our comprehensive analysis of these target genomic regions inferred that high and low pod number-containing mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB comprised majority of the SNP alleles from high (Pusa 1103) and low (ILWC 46) pod number-containing mapping parental accessions, respectively. Taken together, our findings by QTL-seq in an inter-specific mapping population (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) ascertained the presence of two major QTLs (CaqaPN4.1 and CaqaPN4.2) governing PN at the 867.8 Kb [13690423 (SNP_20990A) to 14558233 (SNP_21161A) bp] and 1.80 Mb [31916540 (SNP_27349A) to 33716608 (SNP_28364A) bp] genomic intervals on chromosome 4 of chickpea (Fig. 3A). The SNPs flanking the QTL-seq-derived major PN QTL (CaqaPN4.1 and CaqaPN4.2) were validated in accordance with their expected allelic discrimination by resequencing of PCR amplicons amplified from the parental accessions (Pusa 1103 and ILWC 46) and mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB. Graphs illustrating the SNP index and <U+0394> (SNP index) of HPNB (high pod number bulk), LPNB (low pod number bulk) generated from mQTL-seq analysis in two inter-specific chickpea mapping populations [A: (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and B: (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)].

Molecular mapping of QTL-seq-derived major PN QTLs in a mapping population of Pusa 256 × ILWC 46The SNP index of individual SNPs revealing differentiation between high (Pusa 256 and HPNB) and low (ILWC 46 and LPNB) pod number-containing mapping parents and bulks was measured. The estimation of average SNP index (across a 5-Mb genomic interval of a 10-kb sliding window) and <U+0394> (SNP index) of HPNB and LPNB, and their plotting across eight kabuli chromosomes (following aforementioned strategies) identified two major genomic regions (CaqbPN4.1: 13770030 to 14407570 bp and CaqbPN4.2: 31916540 to 33195624 bp) on chromosome 4 exhibiting the average SNP index of higher than 0.9 in HPNB and lower than 0.1 in LPNB (Fig. 3B). The authenticity of these identified major genomic regions harbouring PN QTLs was confirmed by valid significant <U+0394> (SNP index) value (at 99% significance level). The detail analysis of these target genomic regions indicated the presence of most of the SNP alleles from Pusa 256 and ILWC 46 in high and low pod number-containing mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB, respectively. Collectively, the QTL-seq in an inter-specific mapping population (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46) identified two major QTLs (CaqbPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.2) regulating PN at the 637.5 kb [13770030 (SNP_15561B) to 14407570 (SNP_15696B) bp] and 1.28 Mb [31916540 (SNP_18917B) to 33195624 (SNP_19254B) bp] genomic intervals on chromosome 4 of chickpea (Fig. 3B). The SNPs flanking the QTL-seq-derived major PN QTL (CaqbPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.2) were validated according to their expected allelic discrimination by resequencing of PCR amplicons amplified from the parental accessions (Pusa 256 and ILWC 46) and mapping individuals constituting the HPNB and LPNB.3.7. QTL region-specific trait association mappingThe four major genomic regions underlying PN QTLs (CaqaPN4.1, CaqaPN4.2, CaqbPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.2) detected in two mapping populations of Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46 and Pusa 256 × ILWC 46 using QTL-seq were compared and correlated (Fig. 4A and B). This led to identification of two consensus major genomic regions with short physical intervals of 637.5 kb [CaqbPN4.1: 13770030 (SNP_15561B) to 14407570 (SNP_15696B) bp] and 1.28 Mb [CaqbPN4.2: 31916540 (SNP_18917B) to 33195624 (SNP_19254B) bp] on chromosome 4 harbouring PN QTLs (Fig. 4A and B). These QTLs, being well-validated across two diverse chickpea mapping populations under study, were considered as robust QTLs. The scale-down of longer major PN QTL intervals identified by QTL-seq in individual mapping population into shorter QTL regions by mQTL-seq implicates the significance of mQTL-seq over QTL-seq approach for high-resolution molecular mapping along with fine mapping of major potential genomic regions underlying robust trait-regulatory QTLs in chickpea. Based on congruent physical position, one of the robust QTL (CaqbPN4.1) of these exhibited correspondence with a priorly identified known major QTL regulating pod number/plant was mapped on an intra-specific genetic linkage map of chickpea (Fig. 4A and B).41 The remaining one robust PN QTL (CaqbPN4.2) was considered to be novel (not previously identified) and thus selected by us to delineate potential candidate gene-regulating pod number through QTL region-specific high-resolution trait association mapping. A wider practical applicability of mQTL-seq strategy for rapid detection of major as well as robust high-resolution PN QTLs using two F5 inter-specific chickpea mapping populations (with at least one common parental accession) was evident. More recently, such QTL-seq approach has been deployed in multiple mapping populations for scanning the major QTLs controlling fruit weight and locule number in tomato.45 Collectively, this suggests the accuracy and robustness of mQTL-seq as an approach for rapid delineation of high-resolution major QTLs governing traits of agronomic importance at a genome-wide scale in chickpea. The integration of <U+0394> (SNP index)-based QTL-seq-derived four pod number major QTLs in two mapping populations [A: (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and B: (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)] narrowed down one novel major genomic region harbouring a robust pod number QTL (CaqbPN4.2) into 1.28 Mb sequence interval [between flanking SNP (SNP_18917B and SNP_19254B) markers] indicated by green font on kabuli chickpea chromosome 4. This QTL region was subsequently scaled down into the regulatory (C/T) and coding (C/A) SNPs-containing one candidate PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) gene associated strongly with pod number by combining mQTL-seq with QTL region-specific association analysis (C). *Known pod number QTLs (CaqaPN4.1 and CaqbPN4.1) documented previously by Varshney et al.41 The details regarding SNPs flanking/localized at the major PN QTLs and SNPs in a PPR gene associated with PN are mentioned in the Supplementary Tables S4 and S7.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The targeted resequencing of this 1.28 Mb delineated novel CaqbPN4.2 robust QTL region in high and low pod number-containing mapping parents (Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and bulks (HPNB and LPNB) detected 2,913 high-quality SNPs with an average SNP density of 1/439.4 bp. This contained 1,543 intergenic SNPs and 1,370 SNPs derived from the coding and non-coding sequence components of 448 genes. For QTL region-specific trait association analysis, the genotyping information of 2,913 SNPs mined and mapped on a 1.28 Mb (CaqbPN4.2) novel QTL region was correlated with PN field phenotyping data (PN: 21.9–204.5 with 33% CV and 70% H2) and diversity statistics (population structure, PCA, kinship) of 92 desi and kabuli chickpea accessions (PN-specific association panel). The comprehensive association analysis by effective integration of GLM and MLM outcomes with EMMA and FDR based on multiple-comparisons detected two SNPs (SNP_1 at 32636428 bp: C/A and SNP_19172B at 32640058 bp: C/T) in the CDS and URR of a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein-coding gene revealing strong association (P: 1.5–2.0 × 10-7 and R2 = 25–28%) with PN in chickpea (Fig. 4B and C). This is further ascertained by identification of similar PPR gene-derived regulatory SNP (SNP_19172B at 32640058 bp: C/T) with high <U+0394> (SNP index) (0.8) at CaqbPN4.2 QTL region governing pod number based on our mQTL-seq analysis in two inter-specific mapping populations of chickpea (Fig. 3A and B). Therefore, this strong PN-associated PPR gene localized at a major PN novel QTL interval (CaqbPN4.2) was selected as one of the potential candidate for understanding its efficacy in pod number regulation through differential expression profiling.3.8. Validation of a PN-associated PPR gene through differential expression profilingOne strong PN-associated regulatory and coding SNPs-containing PPR gene delineated at 1.28 Mb major genomic region harbouring a novel CaqbPN4.2 robust QTL (validated by both mQTL-seq- and QTL region-specific association analysis) was selected for differential expression profiling. The primer-pair designed targeting this gene was used for amplification with the RNA isolated from the vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud, ovary, anther and mature pollen) tissues and two pod (~5 mm beginning pod size at 5–10 days after anthesis/DAA and ~2 cm full pod at 15–20 DAA) developmental stages of low and high pod number-containing homozygous mapping individuals (used in QTL-seq analysis) and parental accessions of two mapping populations using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays. A strong PN-associated PPR gene revealed tissue-specific expression in the anthers, mature pollens and pods of parental accessions and mapping individuals compared with their respective vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud and ovary) tissues (Fig. 5). This gene also exhibited pronounced differential up-regulation (~6.7-folds, P = 10-3) in anther, mature pollen and two pod developmental stages (compared with vegetative tissues) of all high and low pod number-containing parental accessions and individuals of two mapping populations under study (Fig. 5). Interestingly, a significant higher (~3.5-fold, P = 10-3) differential up-regulation of PPR gene in anther, mature pollen and pod developmental stages of high pod number-containing parental accessions and mapping individuals compared with low pod number-containing parental accessions and mapping individuals was evident (Fig. 5). Differential expression profiles of one PPR gene delineated at a novel 1.28 Mb major genomic region underlying the robust pod number QTL (CaqbPN4.2) (detected by integrating mQTL-seq with QTL region-specific association analysis) in diverse vegetative (leaf and root) and reproductive (flower bud, ovary, anther and mature pollen) tissues and two pod developmental stages of low and high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous individuals of two mapping populations [(Pusa 1103 × ILWC 46) and (Pusa 256 × ILWC 46)]. The average log signal expression value of PPR gene in various tissues and developmental stages was specified at the top with a colour scale; in which green, black and red colours represent low, medium and high level of expression, respectively. The tissues/stages as well as homozygous mapping individuals and parental accessions utilized for expression profiling are indicated on the top and right sides of expression map, respectively. An endogenous control elongation factor-1 alpha was used in quantitative RT–PCR assay for normalization of the expression value across different tissues/developmental stages of parents and mapping individuals. HPNB: high pod number bulk and LPNB: low pod number bulk. Pod I: Pod development stage 1 (~5 mm beginning pod size at 5–10 days after anthesis/DAA) and Pod II: Pod development stage 2 (~2 cm full pod at 15–20 DAA).

The efficacy of the combinatorial approach integrating genetic and association mapping with expression profiling to scale down potential candidate gene and alleles at a major QTL region governing diverse agronomic traits, including seed weight and pod/seed number is well established in chickpea.9–13, 22,23 A pod number-regulating PPR gene identified in our study, showing >80% sequence conservation with Arabidopsis gene orthologue (At1g52620), is reportedly involved in controlling growth and development-related traits (pollination and embryogenesis) in multiple crop plants, including Arabidopsis and Phaseolus.52,53 Specifically, PPR gene family proteins have definite functional role in regulating proper pollen development by higher accumulation of transcripts in the mature pollen and efficient nuclear-organelle interactions to produce higher fertile seeds (embryogenesis) and pods in diverse plant species.54–62 Accordingly, we observed a higher expression of PPR gene transcripts in the mature pollen and two pod developmental stages of high pod number-containing parental accessions and homozygous mapping individuals vis-a-vis low pod number accessions and mapping individuals in chickpea. However, a detail molecular characterization and functional validation of this gene is essential to decipher its regulation specifically during pollen and pod development causing high pod number in chickpea. The PPR gene once validated in a large scale could be deployed for genomics-assisted crop improvement to develop genetically tailored varieties with higher pod/seed number and yield in chickpea.FundingFunding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR).The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by a research grant from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India (102/IFD/SAN/2161/2013-14).

IntroductionBottom-fermenting strains of brewing yeast—also known as lager beer yeast—represent a large portion of the beer market and have therefore been the focus of mycological research for centuries. Lager beer yeasts have been taxonomically classified as Saccharomyces pastorianus since the 19th century and are classified into two groups according to geographical origin: the Saaz type (Group 1) originally used in Bohemia and the Frohberg type (Group 2) in Germany.1,2Many pure strains have since been identified, including the type strains S. monacensis (CBS1503; Group 1), S. carlsbergensis (CBS1513; Group 1), and S. pastorianus (CBS1538; Group 1) as well as Weihenstephan 34/70 (Group 2), a widely used industrial strain. Saccharomyces pastorianus is an allopolyploid hybrid of two Saccharomyces species: the ale beer yeast S. cerevisiae and a hypothesized novel species similar to S. bayanus. In 2011, S. eubayanus3 was discovered on southern beech trees in Patagonia, South America, and identified as the absent parental species of lager beer yeast. Saccharomyces eubayanus has also recently been identified on trees in Tibet, Far East Asia, spurring a debate about the precise origin of this species.4Genomic analysis techniques, such as array comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH), have identified a difference in ploidy between the two groups of S. pastorianus strains. Group 1 (Saaz type) strains are approximately haploid for the S. cerevisiae genome, whereas Group 2 (Frohberg type) strains are diploid for the S. cerevisiae genome.5 A Sanger sequencing-based genome sequence analysis of S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/706 conducted by our group revealed various genetic features, such as whole-genome structure and genomic divergence, at the single-nucleotide level. The genomes of many interspecies hybrid strains have also been sequenced, including the osmotolerant yeast species Pichia sorbitolphila,7 the Zygosaccharomyces bailii hybrid strain ISA1307,8 and the wine yeast strain VIN7.9 As in our previous study of S. pastorianus,6 most analyses of allopolyploid species genomes have been performed without the genome sequence of one or both parental species. For example, in the case of P. sorbitolphila,7 neither parental species has been isolated; its sequence data are divided into two types based on the GC content of the expected parental species. The lack of information on one or both parental genomes has complicated downstream genomic analyses. Complete (or near-complete) genomes of parental species can provide more information on genomic variation in interspecies hybrids and facilitate the identification of translocation breakpoints between interparental homologous chromosomes at the single-nucleotide level, genome rearrangements, and differences in ploidy.In S. pastorianus, ploidy differences, copy number variations, and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified by array-CGH10,11 or other approaches have suggested that the Saaz (Group 1) and Frohberg (Group 2) types originated from independent hybridization events,11–13 a theory that has gained broad acceptance. In contrast, the recent confirmation of two breakpoints associated with interchromosomal translocation of HSP82 and KEM1 genes implies a common origin.5 Therefore, the evolutionary history of S. pastorianus remains controversial, primarily because of the lack of reference genome information for S. eubayanus. For example, array-CGH analysis was performed based on the S. cerevisiae S288C and S. uvarum CBS7001 genomes,11 which are similar to non-Sc type S. pastorianus, but it was not possible to estimate differences in ploidy or sequence variations between S. pastorianus strains from the results.In the present study, we obtained the whole-genome sequences of 10 S. pastorianus strains by Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) to gain insight into the evolutionary history of this species. The strains included five strains each from Groups 1 and 2, including three type strains [S. monacensis (CBS1503), S. carlsbergensis (CBS1513), and S. pastorianus (CBS1538)] and S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 (W34/70), which we sequenced previously by the Sanger method.6 NGS technology enables more accurate sequencing and produces longer continuous genome sequences. In addition to paired-end sequences, long insert mate-pair libraries were also obtained for the three type strains and W34/70 and were applied to de novo assemblies to obtain overall genomic structures, which were then compared. However, as in the case of previous studies of interspecies hybrid strains,7–9 a more detailed analysis of ploidy and evolutionary relationships based on sequence differences from the assembled sequences was difficult. To precisely determine the sequence differences between strains, we adopted mapping-based analysis using the two parent genomes as reference sequences, including the available S. cerevisiae (Sc) (S288C) genome. Because a reference sequence was not available for S. eubayanus (Se), we assembled the draft genome sequence of S. eubayanus CBS12357 using NGS data. These two reference genomes were used for mapping-based genome comparisons among the 10 S. pastorianus strains that considered the relatively high heterozygosity of S. pastorianus. Here, heterozygosity refers to the sequence difference between intrahomologous (Sc/Sc or Se/Se) chromosomes; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) refers to the loss of heterogeneity between intrahomologous chromosomes. The results provide information on ploidy, novel chromosomal translocations, mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequences, and the phylogenetic relationships among Sc and Se types that provides new insights into the origin and evolutionary history of S. pastorianus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and sequence informationThe following strains were used in this study: S. pastorianus CBS1503 (S. monacensis type strain), CBS1513 (S. carlsbergensis type strain), CBS1538 (S. pastorianus type strain), CBS1174, CBS2440, Weihenstephan 34/70 (W34/70), CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, and CBS5832; S. eubayanus CBS12357 (type strain) and BaiFY1; S. bayanus NBRC1948 and CBS380; and S. cerevisiae S288C. Saccharomyces pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 was provided by Fachhochschule Weihenstephan (Freising, Germany); the other strains, except S. eubayanus BaiFY1, were obtained from the CBS-KNAW Culture Collection Center (Utrecht, The Netherland). Sequence data for S. eubayanus BaiFY1 were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive, NCBI.2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyWe prepared paired-end sequencing data with the Illumina platform (Hayward, CA, USA) for 14 strains of three species: S. pastorianus Group 1 (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, CBS1174, and CBS2440) and Group 2 (W34/70, CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, and CBS5832); S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1); and S. bayanus (NBRC1948 and CBS380). With the exception of S. eubayanus BaiFY1, all sequence data were determined in this study by Illumina Miseq. Saccharomyces bayanus sequences were used only for mtDNA analysis. Libraries (insert size = 600 bp) were prepared using the TruSeq PCR-free DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) with a read length of 300 bp. Other sequence data for S. eubayanus BaiFY1 obtained from the Hiseq2000 platform with 151-bp paired-end libraries were available from the Sequence Read Archive (accession no. SRX646335). For de novo assembly, mate-pair libraries for CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, W34/70, and CBS12357 were prepared using the Nextera Mate Pair Sample Prep kit (Illumina) and 3,000- to 15,000-bp fragments extracted from an agarose gel for each sample. All libraries were also sequenced using Illumina Miseq. Low-quality regions and adaptor sequences in the reads were trimmed with Platanus_trim v.1.0.7 for subsequent analyses.The genomes of five strains sequenced from the paired-end and mate-pair libraries were assembled using Platanus v.1.2.4 software.14 Contig assembly was performed using only paired-end libraries, and scaffolding and gap closing were performed using both libraries. Prior to scaffolding, mate-pair reads were mapped on contigs using the BWA program15 to remove duplicate reads generated during PCR amplification. Contig assembly for interspecies hybrid strains (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70) was conducted with parameter -n 15 (for W34/70) or 20 (for other strains), and scaffolding was performed with parameter -u 0 to avoid removing low-coverage scaffolds derived from haploid chromosomes. The results of the assembly were evaluated by confirming the physical coverage of 6-kb mate-pair reads. Finally, contamination and mtDNA sequences were removed from scaffolds =500 bp by alignment with NCBI Bacteria DB, RefSeq viral DB, and BLASTN16 for mtDNA sequences (minimum identity = 90% and minimum query coverage = 50%). The assembly of mitochondrial genomes is described below. CBS12357 was assembled using Platanus v.1.2.4 with default settings.To construct a CBS12357 draft genome for hybrid strains in subsequent analyses, scaffolds were aligned with the S. cerevisiae S288C complete genome sequence using BLASTN. Only one locus, covering the rDNA region in chromosome XII, was connected by N-runs sequences manually, and two known interchromosomal translocations6,17 (namely, II–IV and VIII–XV) that were structurally distinct from S288C were not divided and maintained. Finally, we obtained super-scaffolds that were adequate to call chromosome-level reference sequences. To estimate the genome size of the hybrid strains, paired-end reads were mapped to the parental species' genomes (S288C complete and CBS12357 draft genomes) and to the mtDNA of each strain, and the length of regions covering =10 reads was calculated.2.3. Detection of interchromosomal translocations in hybrid strainsInterchromosomal translocations between Sc and Se types were detected based on mate-pair reads, which were mapped to the reference (S. cerevisiae S288C complete and S. eubayanus CBS12357 draft) genomes using BWA after removing low-identity and multihit reads. Chromosomes were divided into 10,000-bp blocks, and the number of mate-pair reads linking the blocks was tabulated. Links consisting of =100 pairs between Sc- and Se-type blocks were displayed in a circus plot.18 To reveal breakpoints at the nucleotide level, local assembly was performed using paired-end reads; when one of these was mapped near a breakpoint (as estimated by the procedure described above) and the opposite side was not mapped, the read corresponding to the latter was identified as a candidate covering the breakpoint region. These reads were collected and assembled.2.4. Estimation of ploidy in hybrid strainsSequence coverage for the 10 S. pastorianus strains was calculated based on the number of reads mapped to the two parental species [S. cerevisiae (S288C) and S. eubayanus (CBS12357)] to confirm the accuracy of the total assembly size and estimate the ploidy of each chromosome. Sequence reads were mapped to the reference genomes using BWA. Mapped reads with <90% identity or with multiple hits were removed. Following realignment using GATK realigner,19 sequence coverage at each locus was calculated using SAMtools mpileup.20 Ploidy was estimated as the ratio of the sequence coverage of the focus region to the haploid coverage obtained from the whole-genome coverage distribution. The moving average of the calculated ploidy (window size = 10,000 bp and step size = 1,000 bp) was then plotted.2.5. SNV calling in 10 S. pastorianus strainsMapping of paired-end reads and filtering were conducted as described above, and SNV calling was performed using SAMtools mpileup and an original Perl script that calculated the number of mapped reads, their strands, variants, and allele frequencies (AFs; i.e. the ratio of reads supporting the variant to mapped reads at the locus) from the mpileup format. SNVs were identified according to the following criteria: =20 reads were mapped to the locus; variants were supported by two or more mapped reads on both the forward and reverse strands; and insertion/deletion (InDel) mutations were excluded. SNVs were classified as either homo (0.8 = AF) or hetero (0.2 = AF < 0.8) type.2.6. Phylogenetic analysisPhylogenetic analysis of the 10 S. pastorianus strains and 2 parental species was performed based on SNV sites for which =20 reads were mapped in all strains, excluding InDel mutations. Analyses were conducted separately for Sc and Se types to identify differences between the types. Heterozygous sites were also considered, and each allele at each SNV site was treated separately. Phylogenetic estimates were calculated by the maximum likelihood approach using phyml (-b 1,000),21 and phylogenetic trees were generated using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).2.7. Assignment of hetero-SNVs and haplotype phasingTo build two intrahomologous chromosomes from the diploid Sc-type chromosomes in Group 2 strains, the linkage relationships of adjacent hetero-SNVs were solved by pair reads mapped on a region bearing two or more hetero-SNVs. Regions in which pair reads solved the linkage relationships of consecutive adjacent hetero-SNVs were divided into two lines corresponding to chromosomal haplotypes and were defined as continuous haplotype-phased blocks. Blocks were divided by unphased (mainly caused by long no-hetero-SNVs) regions. W34/70 sequence reads were used in this analysis for the following reasons: the Sc-type genome of W34/70 has the highest heterozygosity among the five Group 2 strains; and mate-pair data (insert size 3 and 6 kb) were available. A Group 1 consensus sequence was constructed based on the major alleles in the five Group 1 strains. If the major allele was undefined at a locus, the locus was removed from comparison with W34/70 haplotypes.2.8. Phylogenetic analysis based on haplotype-phased chromosomal SNVsThe identities between each haplotype W34/70 sequence and Group 1 consensus sequences were calculated at each block. The W34/70 haplotyped chromosomes with higher homology to Group 1 were labelled as ‘W34/70_a’, and the others were labelled as ‘W34/70_b’. Finally, the identities between Group 1 vs. W34/70_a and Group 1 vs. W34/70_b were aggregated. For comparison, W34/70 artificial intrahomologous chromosomes were virtually constructed by randomly shuffling allele nucleotides and ignoring linkage information at every locus. The obtained artificial chromosomes were divided into two groups, W34/70_a and W34/70_b, according to the same methods for real intrahomologous chromosomes. This ‘shuffling test’ was repeated 100 times, and the average was calculated.2.9. Assembly and phylogenetic analysis of mtDNAMtDNA assembly and phylogenetic analysis were performed for nine strains of four species, i.e. S. cerevisiae (S288C), S. pastorianus (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70), S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1), and S. bayanus (NBRC1948 and CBS380). MtDNA sequences (with the exception of S288C) were assembled using only high-frequency k-mers (i.e. >2-fold higher than the average k-mer frequency value obtained from sequence reads) because the copy number of mitochondria was much higher than that of chromosomes. After gap closing, scaffolds were aligned to S. cerevisiae S288C mtDNA using BLASTN and assembled with paired-end reads that were mapped to the edges of the scaffold to generate a circle.The mtDNA of each strain was aligned with the open reading frames (ORFs) of S. cerevisiae S288C mtDNA using BLASTX to identify the ORFs of each strain. Multiple alignment with the ORFs was performed using ClustalW2. Phylogenetic estimates using the maximum likelihood method were obtained with phyml (-b 1,000), and a phylogenetic tree was generated using FigTree.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencingThe sequence sizes of each strain and library are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1; 32-mer frequency distributions were calculated from the sequence reads of five strains each of S. pastorianus Groups 1 and 2 and of S. eubayanus CBS12357 (Fig. 1A–C). In haploid or low-heterozygosity diploid cases, the k-mer frequency distribution exhibited a single peak at the average sequence frequency, as observed for S. eubayanus CBS12357 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, most of the 32-mer distributions for S. pastorianus strains had two or more peaks (Fig. 1A and B), which may have resulted from the aneuploidy of hybrid strains. Based on the previous array-CGH-based analysis,11 Group 1 strains are mainly derived from haploid S. cerevisiae and diploid S. eubayanus, and the left and right peaks in the double peak correspond to sequences originating from these two species, respectively. However, the presence of three or more peaks implies that some chromosomal regions are triploid or polyploid for parental strain chromosomes. Similarly, Group 2 strains are considered to be mainly from diploid S. cerevisiae and diploid S. eubayanus, yet the 32-mer distribution did not exhibit a pure single peak and, indeed, displayed double peaks in some strains (CBS1483) or low peaks resembling shoulders occurring at approximately half the frequency of the highest peak (W34/70, CBS1484, and CBS5832). This irregular distribution may have been due to heterozygosity in addition to polyploidy. The existence of SNVs between homologous chromosomes creates different 32-mers derived from each haplotype, and highly heterozygous genomes cause significant peaks at half the frequency of diploid peaks. The 32-mer distribution graph confirmed that S. pastorianus strains exhibit complex polyploidy or heterozygosity. The left-most peaks derived from the haploid genome range from 30 to 70, suggesting that the number of sequence reads for the hybrid strains was adequate. The total sequence size of the Illumina paired-end reads for S. eubayanus CBS12357 was 1.4 Gb with an estimated genome coverage of 120-fold, whereas that of the mate-pair reads was 2.8 Gb, with insert sizes of 3–15 kb.

Genome assemblyThe assembly statistics for S. pastorianus CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70 and S. eubayanus CBS12357 are presented in Table 2 and were, in general, very robust. For example, all N50 lengths exceeded 400 kb, and except in CBS1538, the longest scaffold lengths exceeded 1 Mb, comparable to the length of the longest chromosome of S. cerevisiae S288C (chromosome IV, 1.5 Mb). We previously reported an N50 length of 108 kb for W34/70,6 only approximately one-seventh of the value observed here. In particular, the assembly for S. eubayanus CBS12357 yielded 17 scaffolds >5,000 bp, one more than the chromosome number of 16. The S. eubayanus CBS12357 chromosome corresponding to chromosome XII of S. cerevisiae S288C was divided into two scaffolds that overlapped the rDNA region and were connected by ‘N run 5000 bp’. We ultimately obtained 16 super-scaffolds with a total genome size of 11.7 Mb—slightly smaller than that of S288C—with 30 gaps totalling 22,137 bp. Based on the total size of the scaffolds, the number of scaffolds, and the small number of gaps, the S. eubayanus CBS12357 draft genome was deemed adequate for use as a reference genome. Assembly statistics for five strains of two speciesAssembly statistics for five strains of two speciesThe assembly statistics revealed some interesting features. The total sequence size of the Group 2 W34/70 strain (22.5 Mb) was nearly equal to the sum of the S. cerevisiae S288C and S. eubayanus CBS12357 genome sizes (12.1 and 11.7 Mb, respectively). In contrast, the genome sizes of Group 1 strains—which ranged from 14.4 to 19.2 Mb—were much smaller than this value, suggesting partial or complete chromosomal deletion. Additionally, although the four S. pastorianus strains exhibited robust statistics (e.g. N50 and maximum scaffold length), the scaffold numbers were much higher than those of S. eubayanus CBS12357. Large N50 values and the considerable number of scaffolds suggest the existence of many short scaffolds, potentially due to the complexity of chromosome structure. During interchromosomal translocation, a homologous diploid or triploid chromosome may translocate to another interparental chromosome, leaving behind the remaining one or two homologous chromosomes. A junctional structure would then be present in the chromosome, and assembly results would be divided. Interchromosomal translocations have been reported,5,6,2,2 and this scenario is also supported by the unusual 32-mer distribution (Fig. 1). These complex chromosome structures may not be resolved by the assembly method; in the following sections, we describe our investigation of translocation structure performed by mapping mate-pair reads and the elucidation of ploidy distribution by mapping paired-end reads.3.3. Estimation of ploidy in S. pastorianus strainsThe ploidy of the 10 S. pastorianus strains was estimated based on the sequence coverage of paired-end reads mapped onto the genomes of the parental species (Fig. 2). Clear differences in ploidy between Groups 1 and 2 were observed. In the former, the Sc-type genome was haploid in most cases, and partial or complete chromosomal deletions were frequently observed; chromosomes I, IX, X, and the left arm of VII were present in these strains, and deletions of the right arm of chromosome IV, left arm of XIII, and the entire chromosome XII were common. Most Sc-type chromosomes in Group 1 were haploid or missing, whereas most Se-type chromosomes were diploid or triploid. In contrast, Group 2 Sc-type chromosomes were always haploid or diploid, whereas Se-type chromosomes ranged from haploid to triploid. Each parental type appeared aneuploid in each strain, but the sum of interhomologous chromosomes (between Sc- and Se-type) was approximately identical. Specifically, five strains in Group 1 and CBS2156 were basically triploid, and those in Group 2—except for CBS2156—were tetraploid. Despite the chromosomal deletion trails that were observed, a mechanism for maintaining a constant total number of intra- and interparental homologous chromosomes appears to exist in Sc and Se types. The differences in ploidy between the two groups provide additional evidence that both groups originated independently from the same parental species.

The blue and orange dots indicate the ploidy of Sc- (left) and Se- (right) type chromosomes, respectively. The vertical axis represents the estimated ploidy, which was calculated as the ratio of sequence coverage at each locus to the estimated haploid coverage; the horizontal axis represents chromosomal loci. In general, Group 1 strains had triploid genomes (haploid or non-Sc type, and diploid or triploid Se type), whereas Group 2 strains were tetraploid (haploid to triploid Sc and Se types).

Interchromosomal translocations between Sc- and Se-type genomesInterchromosomal translocations were detected by mate-pair reads in CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70 (Fig. 3). Previous studies have detected 11, 9, and 8 Sc-/Se-type translocations in CBS1503,5 CBS1513,5,2,2 and W34/70,6 respectively, and these translocations were verified by PCR amplification prior to the start of our study. Our analysis confirmed these known translocations in the three strains, demonstrating that this method is capable of detecting these events. Moreover, two translocations present at the HSP825,2,2 and KEM1 loci5 were also confirmed in the other six S. pastorianus strains using paired-end sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). The two breakpoints were completely matched at the nucleotide level among all Group 1 and 2 strains, with the exception of a chromosomal deletion (HSP82 of CBS1538 and CBS1174). Novel interchromosomal translocations were also detected by our study—one each in CBS1503, CBS1513, and CBS1538 and two in W34/70. One of the novel translocations common to the four strains was further investigated by paired-end sequence alignment, revealing that all 10 S. pastorianus strains share a breakpoint within ZUO1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The remaining translocation present in W34/70 spans from Sc-type chromosome VIII PRP8 to Se-type chromosome XV–VIII (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interchromosomal translocations between Sc- and Se-type genomes. The circular layouts show interchromosomal translocations between Sc and Se types detected by mate-pair links in Group 1 (CBS15103, CBS1513, and CBS1538) and Group 2 (W34/70) strains. Blue and orange bars represent Sc-type (left) and Se-type (right) chromosomes, respectively. The grey histograms within the circles represent sequence coverage, and regions without bars indicate chromosomal deletions. Grey intersecting lines indicate interchromosomal translocations supported by mate-pair reads bridging the Sc and Se types. Green lines indicate translocations shared by the two groups. Three interchromosomal translocations were common to both groups. The line thickness is proportional to the number of links supported by mate-pair reads.

SNV analysis against reference genomes and their chromosomal distributionThe SNVs were analysed using the S. cerevisiae S288C complete and S. eubayanus CBS12357 draft genomes (Sc and Se types, respectively) as references and classified as homo- and hetero-SNVs (Table 3). The number of homo-SNVs was similar among the strains, and the homo-SNVs were present at a density of 1/200 bp in both the Sc and Se types, indicating that the reference genomes of both species were sufficiently similar to be used for mapping-based analysis. For the Sc-type, SNVs were less prevalent in Group 1 than in Group 2; however, this did not reflect a lower SNV density because many Group 1 Sc chromosomes were missing. In contrast, the number of hetero-Sc-type SNVs in Group 2 was markedly increased compared with Se-type SNVs, along with a 10-fold higher density. In Group 1, fewer hetero-SNVs were present because most Sc-type chromosomes were haploid or missing in this group. Number of SNVs in 10 S. pastorianus strainsNumber of SNVs in 10 S. pastorianus strainsThe higher proportion of hetero-SNVs in Sc-type genomes in Group 2 compared with Se-type genomes suggests that the high heterozygosity in the former originated from an ancestral ale beer yeast.2,3 Indeed, ale beer strains—for instance, FostersB and FostersO—reportedly have high numbers of hetero-SNVs (up to 37,784 and 32,600, respectively). In comparison, lager beer yeast Sc-type genomes exhibit low heterozygosity but an uneven distribution of hetero-SNVs along Sc-type chromosomes, with some regions exhibiting many and others few or no hetero-SNVs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4). An even distribution of hetero-SNVs has been reported for the S. cerevisiae sake yeast strain Kyokai no. 72,4 and the industrial fuel-ethanol fermentative strain CAT-1,2,5 presumably as the result of frequent LOH. Distribution of hetero-SNVs in Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII of Group 2 strains. The distribution of heterozygosity along Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII in five Group 2 strains (CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, CBS5832, and W34/70 from top to bottom for each chromosome) was determined by calculating a moving average of SNV density (window size = 10 kb and step size = 1 kb). Hetero-SNVs were unevenly distributed, possibly due to LOH. In many regions, low/no heterozygosity was observed in the five strains, whereas in other regions, the distribution pattern of low/no heterozygosity regions differed between strains. LOH was therefore considered a relatively frequent event, with shared low/no heterozygosity regions likely shaped in the common ancestor or by overlapping LOH events. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Distribution of hetero-SNVs in Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII of Group 2 strains. The distribution of heterozygosity along Sc-type chromosomes IV and VIII in five Group 2 strains (CBS1483, CBS1484, CBS2156, CBS5832, and W34/70 from top to bottom for each chromosome) was determined by calculating a moving average of SNV density (window size = 10 kb and step size = 1 kb). Hetero-SNVs were unevenly distributed, possibly due to LOH. In many regions, low/no heterozygosity was observed in the five strains, whereas in other regions, the distribution pattern of low/no heterozygosity regions differed between strains. LOH was therefore considered a relatively frequent event, with shared low/no heterozygosity regions likely shaped in the common ancestor or by overlapping LOH events. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Based on these observations and previous reports, the uneven distribution of heterozygosity may be due to the loss of variation between intrahomologous chromosomes. After a hybridization event between S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus, variations between intrahomologous chromosomes in Sc types are thought to have gradually disappeared via LOH. Regions of high hetero-SNV density likely originated from the ancestral ale beer yeast, whereas low-density regions or those with no hetero-SNVs are likely the imprint of LOH. Low/no heterozygosity was observed in various regions in all five Group 2 strains, albeit with different distribution patterns. Therefore, LOH is presumed to have been a relatively frequent event, with low/no heterozygosity regions arising in the common ancestor or as a result of overlapping LOH events.3.6. Phylogenetic analysis based on chromosomal SNVs against reference genomesPhylogenetic trees based on SNVs in chromosomes queried against reference genomes were constructed separately for the Sc and Se types (Fig. 5). In the Sc-type tree, the strains were segregated into two clades, Groups 1 and 2, in agreement with previous studies11,12 based on partial PCR-based sequence data. In contrast, the Se-type phylogenetic tree revealed that S. pastorianus strains were mixed in nearly a single clade, with no significant phylogenetic difference between Groups 1 and 2. Indeed, the Se-type variant rate among the 10 S. pastorianus strains was only 0.063%, which was much lower than that of the Sc-type (0.348%). For the Sc-type, the tree suggests that the two groups—which are separated by geographical location—have independent origins. However, the Se-type phylogenetic tree suggests that the different aspect from that of Sc-type. Se-type genomes of the two groups look like originated from a common ancestor. Thus, the conflicting characteristics of the phylogenetic trees may be attributable to differences in genetic features between the Sc and Se type strains, namely ploidy and hetero-SNV density.

Assignment of hetero-SNVs and haplotype phasingWe further validated these SNVs to address the conflicting phylogenic analysis by focusing on the hetero-SNVs in Group 2. This assessment revealed interesting results for the SNV numbers for Group 1 and Group 2 strains (Table 4). Specifically, nearly all the homo–hetero-SNVs observed between Group 1 and Group 2 are consistent relationships (i.e. Group 1's homo allele is equal to either allele of Group 2's hetero-SNV at the corresponding locus), and there are few conflicting SNVs. With few exceptions, either allele of the Group 2 hetero-type SNVs consists of the same sequence as the corresponding positions' haploid Group 1 allele. To confirm that this relationship was not coincidental, we conducted an additional analysis to solve the linkage relationships of W34/70 adjacent hetero-SNVs (‘phasing’) based on sequence data to construct two separate intrahomologous haploid chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). We obtained 304 blocks containing five or more consecutive hetero-SNVs each. The total size of the blocks was 1,876,249 bp (15.6% of the whole Sc type genome), and the blocks consisted of 9,765 hetero-SNVs (89.6% of all hetero-SNVs in W34/70). To maximize the length of sequences comparable to phased haplotypes of W34/70, a consensus sequence was built for the Group 1 strains. As shown in Fig. 5A, the differences between Group 1 strains are quite few and seemingly negligible for this analysis. Finally, we constructed a total of 274 blocks (1,705,313 bp including 8,731 hetero-SNVs) that could be compared with the Group 1 consensus sequence, covering 80.1% of all hetero-SNVs in W34/70.

Phylogenetic analysis based on haplotype-phased chromosomal SNVsAs the result of the analysis described above, we obtained 274 blocks consisting of three Sc-type chromosome sequences each (i.e. one Group 1 consensus chromosome and two W34/70 haplotype-phased intrahomologous chromosomes). We divided the phased chromosomes into two groups, W34/70_a and W34/70_b, based on sequence identity with Group 1 (Supplementary Fig. S5C and Fig. 6A). The same analysis results for the randomly shuffled hetero alleles of W34/70 dropping off the linkage information (Supplementary Fig. S5D and E) are presented in Fig. 6B. As shown in Fig. 6A, the Group 1 and W34/70_a identity distribution was significantly higher than that between Group 1 and W34/70_b, but no significant difference in the two distributions was observed based on randomly divided allele information (Fig. 6B). In addition, a phylogenetic tree of the consensus sequence of the Group 1 strains, the two haplotypes of W34/70 (W34/70_a and W34/70_b), and S288c is presented in Fig. 6C. The tree was described based on 14,322 sites containing 8,731 hetero-SNVs within 274 blocks. As shown in Fig. 6C, Group 1 and W34/70_a reside in the same clade. Similarly, the phylogenetic tree of the other four Group 2 strains revealed that all Group 2 ‘type a’ chromosomes reside in the same clade as Group 1 (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results support the non-coincidental nature of the observation that either of the Group 2 hetero-type SNV alleles has the same sequence with the corresponding positions' haploid Group 1 allele, thus strongly suggesting that one of Group 2's chromosomes is shared with Group 1's chromosomes.

Traces of frequent LOH events observed in haplotype-phased Sc-type chromosomesAs mentioned above, the uneven distribution of hetero-SNVs might be evidence of frequent LOH events (Fig. 4). In addition, we identified two examples of evidence of LOH in haplotype-phased intrahomologous Sc-type chromosomes. We also observed consecutive regions with hetero-SNVs and both types of homo alleles constituting corresponding hetero nucleotides in the Group 2 strains (Fig. 7A). All SNVs of Group 2 in these regions—which span 16.0 kb—exhibited this pattern, and there were no exclusive SNVs. Moreover, the Group 1 strains exhibited either type of homo allele. Genomes with hetero-SNVs may be more ancestral type, with LOH events likely occurring independently in each strain, thus yielding two types of homo alleles at those loci. Another example is presented in Fig. 7B; blocks spanning ~17 kb indicate that the Group 1 sequences are nearly identical to either sequence in the hetero Group 2 strains (W34/70, CBS1483, and CBS1484). In addition, CBS2156 and CBS5832 lost heterozygosity and have the same sequences as Group 1 strains, with the exception of two continuous regions of homo-SNVs between Group 1 strains and Group 2 strains (~3 and ~5 kb regions shown in green boxes). The full elucidation of the evolutionary history of this 17-kb block is nearly impossible, but these regions suggest the existence of other LOH events for common Group 2 ancestor strains. These homo-SNV ‘island regions’ in the solved linkage blocks are the difference between the Group 1 and W34/70_a-type chromosome sequences. Therefore, Group 1–W34/70_a has different sequences and branch lengths remaining in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6A). Here, we set a threshold length and divided into separate blocks if the distance between adjacent SNV loci exceeded the threshold. The phylogenetic trees resulting from threshold lengths of 1000 and 300 bp are presented in Supplementary Fig. S7. The threshold length correlates with branch length in Group 1–W34/70_a. This phenomenon is further evidence of frequent LOH. If an LOH event occurred for a W34/70 chromosome, a homo-SNV region was established. If the opposite allele from Group 1 remained, a homo-SNV is observed in this region and caused branch length in the phylogenetic tree. If the same allele as Group 1 remained, no SNVs were detected in this continuous region. For example, in Fig. 7B, no SNV regions are observed immediately right of the left region from 396,036 to 397,000 bp, which may be the result of an LOH with the corresponding remaining alleles in Group 1. When the threshold was set shorter than this silent SNV region, the blocks were divided. Thus, shorter thresholds facilitate the detection of shorter LOH regions, resulting in shorter branch lengths. Evidence of LOH observed in haplotype-phased chromosomes. Two examples of regions in which LOH is expected to have occurred in some strains. (A) The common ancestor of the strains is considered to have had hetero-SNVs in these regions, and some strains are suspected to have undergone LOH, thus switching SNVs from the hetero to the homo type. (B) In this block, nested LOH events likely occurred.

The origin of S. pastorianus mtDNATo determine the origin of S. pastorianus mtDNA, the mtDNA of eight strains from three species was assembled into a circular scaffold. The mtDNA sizes and GC contents are presented in Table 5. In S. pastorianus strains CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70, the mtDNA was ~69 kb, smaller than that of S. cerevisiae S288C (85,779 bp) but slightly larger than those of S. eubayanus CBS12357 (64,290 bp) and BaiFY1 (67,205 bp). The S. pastorianus strain mtDNA exhibited conserved synteny with the mtDNA of S. eubayanus and S. bayanus. Mitochondrial genome in S. pastorianus strains and related speciesMitochondrial genome in S. pastorianus strains and related speciesPhylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial ORFs revealed that the mtDNA of S. pastorianus strains shares a common origin between Groups 1 and 2, with BaiFY1 exhibiting greater similarity in mtDNA to S. pastorianus (Fig. 8). The mtDNA of interspecies hybrids can be inherited from either parental species. Although it was previously demonstrated that S. pastorianus mtDNA is not of the Sc type,2,6 it could not be confirmed as Se type because the mtDNA sequence of S. eubayanus had not been determined. Interestingly, BaiFY1 mtDNA (isolated in Tibet)4 differs considerably from that of CBS12357 (isolated in Patagonia),3 with a sequence identity of 90–95% between the two strains despite being pure strains of the same species. Therefore, the Se-type genome of S. pastorianus strains is thought to originate from Tibet or its surrounding regions, consistent with previous studies.4Phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial ORFs. Shown are the phylogenetic relationships among S. pastorianus (CBS1503, CBS1513, CBS1538, and W34/70), its parental species S. cerevisiae (S288C) and S. eubayanus (CBS12357 and BaiFY1), and the related species S. bayanus (CBS380 and NBRC1948) based on mitochondrial ORFs. Four S. pastorianus strains (from Groups 1 and 2) are located in the same clade. Additionally, the mtDNA of S. eubayanus BaiFY1 is most closely related to that of S. pastorianus, suggesting that the latter originated from a single parental species (S. eubayanus).

Evolutionary history of S. pastorianusOn the basis of these results, we discuss whether the S. pastorianus strains originated from independent hybridization events or a common event. Translocation analysis revealed that the Group 1 and 2 strains share at least three interchromosomal translocations at the nucleotide level, indicative of common ancestors for both the Sc- and Se-type parental strains. The phylogenetic mtDNA genome analysis provided further support for a common origin (Tibet). In contrast, ploidy and phylogenetic analyses using SNVs against reference sequences suggested that the groups have different Sc-type ancestors and therefore independent evolutionary origins. The frequency of translocations is known to be much higher than that of point mutations;2,7 therefore, SNVs provide more robust evidence. However, hetero-SNV analysis indicated that 17.0–39.2% of SNV sites between Groups 1 and 2 could be accounted for by consistent SNV relationships (Table 4). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis using haplotype-phased sequences suggested that Group 1 and Group 2 strains may share haploid Sc-type chromosomes as well as a common ancestor.Based on these analyses, we hypothesized that at least one hybridization event was shared between Group 1 and 2 strains. Following this hypothesis, the difference in ploidy between the two groups can be explained by the chromosomal deletions in Group 1 (Fig. 9A) or an additional hybrid Sc-type genome in Group 2 (Fig. 9B). In the former scenario, a common ancestor originating from both Sc- and Se-types had a diploid genome, with subsequent chromosomal translocations; the ancestral Group 1 strains then experienced numerous chromosomal deletions in the Sc-type genome, leaving only some haploid chromosomes in the current Group 1 strains. In the latter scenario, a common ancestor originated from the first hybrid between Sc-type haploid and Se-type diploid genomes, followed by the formation of two groups after chromosomal translocations. In the Group 1 strains, chromosomal deletions in the Sc-type genome occurred, whereas the ancestral Group 2 strain interbred with another Sc-type species to produce a second hybrid. Two hypotheses regarding S. pastorianus origins based on shared chromosomal translocations and differences in ploidy between Groups 1 and 2. (A) Hybridization between diploid Sc and Se types occurred before chromosomal translocations, whereas chromosomal deletions occurred only in ancestral Group 1 strains. (B) After hybridization between haploid Sc and diploid Se types and chromosomal translocations, ancestral Group 2 strains gained another Sc type (i.e. a second hybridization event occurred).

(B) After hybridization between haploid Sc and diploid Se types and chromosomal translocations, ancestral Group 2 strains gained another Sc type (i.e. a second hybridization event occurred). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.However, the remaining 60–80% of SNVs between these two groups are difficult to explain when only accounting for hetero–homo-SNV relationships. To address this point, we assumed that LOH events occurred with high frequency and could produce two homozygous alleles when occurring at a heterozygous location. Therefore, if Group 1 and 2 strains share common chromosomes (dark blue in Fig. 9) and LOH occurred in the diploid ancestor of Group 2 strains (early S. pastorianus in Fig. 9A or after the second hybridization strain in Fig. 9B), these two alleles may be observed randomly. If the opposite allele of Group 1 strains was retained, this site would display a homo-SNV/homo-SNV relationship in the two groups (light blue region for Group 2 in Fig. 9). However, the difference at this site would disappear if the same allele of Group 1 was retained. Consequently, homo-SNVs between the two groups were observed despite their shared common ancestral chromosomes. This speculation is supported by the distribution of hetero- and homo-SNVs between the Group 1 and 2 strains (Supplementary Fig. S8). Hetero-SNVs, homo-SNV regions, and regions with no SNVs co-segregated as continuous blocks, possibly as a result of LOH corresponding to these regions. Furthermore, when we examined individual SNV allele sequences present in the blocks (i.e. at least five continuous SNV sites) in each strain—for which at least one of the alleles of the Group 2 strain exhibited hetero-SNVs—we determined that despite 512 blocks with 11,178 sites expanding to 2.34 Mb, there were only nine conflicting sites (Supplementary Table S2). These observations strongly suggest that the common ancestor of Group 2 had highly heterozygous chromosomes, of which one pair was shared with Group 1. After repeated chromosomal deletions and LOH in continuous regions, some blocks exhibited the homo-SNV/homo-SNV relationship; other blocks displayed no SNVs, and hetero-SNV/homo-SNVs were observed in the remaining 17–39% of the genome.4. ConclusionsSaccharomyces pastorianus is a useful species for investigating the evolutionary history of an interspecies hybrid. The genome sequences of the two parental species, S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus, are available as reference genomes for analysis and can provide details of genome rearrangement events, including interchromosomal translocations, as well as chromosomal deletions and duplications following hybridization. We sequenced 14 strains of three species, including 10 strains of S. pastorianus, by NGS, and we compared the sequences to determine the phylogenetic relationships between S. pastorianus and its relatives. There are two conflicting hypotheses about whether the two S. pastorianus groups are derived from separate or a single hybridization event. Our analyses provide strong evidence that the haploid Sc-type chromosomes of Group 1 genomes and one of the intrahomologous diploid Sc-type chromosomes of Group 2 genomes were shared. Thus, the two S. pastorianus groups are not independent; they may have originated from the same parental species (S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus) and share at least one hybridization event. Many of the SNVs shared by the two groups may have resulted from chromosomal deletion with LOH as an adaptive strategy following hybridization. This evolutionary scenario resolves all of the apparent contradictions, yet the genome sequence alone cannot reveal the driving force behind chromosomal deletions and LOH. Experimental approaches—such as the detection of LOH after hybridization between genomes exhibiting high vs. low heterozygosity—may provide additional insights into these processes.5.

IntroductionPepper (Capsicum spp.) is one of the first domesticated vegetables1 and shows enormous variation in plant architecture, flower-, leaf-, and fruit-related traits.2–4 Most yield and fruit quality traits important in pepper breeding are regulated by multiple genes or so-called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). QTL analyses of morphological traits in pepper have been performed using intraspecific and interspecific populations.5–8 Most QTL analyses for morphological traits have concentrated on fruit-associated traits. For instance, fs3.1 and fs10.1 control fruit shape (ratio of fruit length to fruit width).5,9 Major QTLs controlling fruit weight are present in chromosomes 2 and 4, and in comparison with the tomato genetic map, some of these QTLs were found to be conserved between the two crops.7,8 QTL analyses for plant height, leaf area, stem length, and other traits have also been performed,5,7,10 but no major QTLs were detected and the genes controlling QTLs have not been characterized.For QTL mapping, restriction fragment length polymorphism, amplified fragment length polymorphism, random amplified polymorphic DNA, and microsatellite markers have been widely used.5,7,11,12 However, for accurate detection and characterization of QTLs, high-density genetic maps are required. Recently, a pepper GeneChip containing 30,815 unigenes derived from EST sequences was used for genotyping a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population.10,13 Using a high-density EST-based genetic map, 96 QTLs for 38 traits were mapped.10 However, the genes controlling the QTL regions were not discovered in this analysis.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods are commonly used for whole-genome sequencing.14,15 Once a reference genome is available, SNP markers can be easily developed by aligning resequencing data to the reference genome. Although the time and cost involved in sequencing has been greatly reduced, resequencing large populations or organisms with a large genome remains challenging. Alternatively, low-coverage sequencing is a cost-efficient way to genotype for QTL analyses or association studies using a large number of samples.14 However, due to the low coverage of sequencing reads, this approach misses a large number of genotypes, and new computational tools have been needed to address the resulting reduction in mapping accuracy. Imputation of missing data using a reference genome can increase the power of SNP calling in genetic studies.15,16 Generally, imputation tools predict the genotype of missing data based on the haplotype ratio at that site. This method can increase the accuracy of mapping, and enables usage of most of the sequencing data. An alternative method is the sliding window approach, which has been used in cereal crops such as rice, sorghum, and maize to construct bin maps and for QTL analysis.17–20 Instead of using all SNPs as independent markers, the sliding window approach merges consecutive SNPs into one bin, which can greatly reduce errors caused by inaccurate SNP calling.The first assembled reference genomes of cultivated hot pepper (Capsicum annuum) and wild pepper (C. chinense and C. annuum var. glabriusculum) were released in 2014.21,22 The availability of reference genome information facilitates the identification of horticulturally important genes, the development of useful markers, and improvement of cultivars. In this study, we identified QTLs controlling morphological traits using RILs derived from a cross between C. annuum ‘Perennial’ and C. annuum ‘Dempsey’. To increase the efficiency of QTL analysis, we improved the ultra-high-density genetic map for the reference genome using a sliding window approach. Horticultural traits were evaluated in four environments to detect major QTLs, and the ultra-high-density bin map increased the speed of QTL mapping. Furthermore, we improved the reference genome of pepper by correcting the genetic order of pseudomolecules and anchoring unassigned scaffolds into linkage groups.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA total of 120 F7–F10 RILs obtained from a cross between pungent Capsicum annuum ‘Perennial’ and non-pungent C. annuum ‘Dempsey’ were used. RILs were grown for 3 years (2011, 2012, and 2014) to reduce environmental effects in the detection of QTLs. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in two locations, Anseong (2011 and 2012a) and Suwon, Korea (2012b and 2014). In 2011 and 2012a, plants were grown in the ground, whereas plants were planted in pots in 2012b and 2014. Seeds were disinfected using 2% sodium chlorate and 10% trisodium phosphate. Five plants per line were planted and fruits were harvested separately.2.2. Phenotype evaluationA total of 18 horticultural traits were evaluated for ‘Perennial’, ‘Dempsey’, and 120 RILs based on the definitions of RDA-Genebank, Korea. Stem colour, flower size, fruit position, calyx shape, and immature fruit colour were graded according to the definitions for efficient evaluations (Table 1). The other 14 traits were evaluated in three plants per line using the relevant units and average values were calculated. Traits related to plant architecture, leaf, and flower were evaluated 9 weeks after transplanting in 2011, and 10 weeks after transplanting in 2012a, 2012b, and 2014. Fruit-related traits were evaluated after harvest. For precise measurement of the fruit length and width, the image of hemisected fruits was scanned (Epson V30) and analysed using Tomato Analyser 3.0.23 Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to analyse the relationship between traits in each environment. Morphological traits evaluated in RILsMorphological traits evaluated in RILs2.3. Genetic mapping and bin map constructionSequencing of ‘Perennial’, ‘Dempsey’, and 120 RILs was as described by Kim et al.24 Parental lines were sequenced to 18× coverage and RILs were sequenced to 1× coverage. All sequence data are available under the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI (PRJNA298503). To redo SNP calling, sequencing reads were aligned to C. annuum ‘CM334’ chromosome v.1.55 using BWA version 0.7.12 with default parameters, and SNPs were called using GATK UnifiedGenotyper. High-quality SNPs with minimum sequencing depth 3 for each RIL, quality score 30, and called in at least 12 RILs were selected for further analysis.A slightly modified sliding window approach17 was used to investigate recombination breakpoints and construct a bin map of RILs. The genotype of each window was called with a window size of 5 Mb and step size of 0.5 Mb. The ratio of SNPs with ‘Perennial’ and ‘Dempsey’ genotypes was calculated. When >70% of SNPs had one parental genotype, the window was called as homozygous; otherwise, the window was called as heterozygous. Recombination breakpoints of each RIL were determined by the physical locations where the genotype of window changes. On the basis of the recombination breakpoint position, a physical bin map was constructed as described by Huang et al.17 Briefly, when 120 RILs did not have the recombination breakpoints in 100 kb interval, these regions were combined to one bin. While there are more than two recombination breakpoints in 100 kb interval, they were determined as one breakpoint. To prevent detection of excessive crossovers, further processing was performed. When short heterozygous regions were located in the middle of consecutive ‘Perennial’ or ‘Dempsey’ genotype regions in the raw bin map and these heterozygous regions were shorter than window size, the genotype was manually corrected to match with the adjacent genotype. Bins were used as markers to construct an ultra-high-density genetic map using the Carthagene program21 with default threshold. The Kosambi mapping function was used to calculate the distance (cM) of each bin. Twelve linkage groups were drawn with the MapChart 2.2 program.22 The physical map and genetic map were compared using Marker Browser developed by the Phyzen Genomics Institute (Seoul, Korea).2.4. Anchoring of unassigned scaffoldsUnmapped reads of ‘Perennial’, ‘Dempsey’, and 120 RILs were aligned to ‘CM334’ unassigned scaffolds v.1.55 (http://peppergenome.snu.ac.kr/, accessed 7 December 2015). The alignment and SNP calling pipeline was the same as that used for bin map construction. To assign the unassigned scaffolds, each scaffold was considered as one bin marker. The genotype of the scaffold in each RIL was determined based on the ratio between the SNPs and the ‘Perennial’ and ‘Dempsey’ genotypes. Genotyped scaffolds were mapped on the bin map using the Carthagene program21 with an logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 5 and a distance threshold of 20 cM.2.5. QTL analysisAll phenotyping data were used for QTL analysis. Composite interval mapping was performed with Windows QTL Cartographer 2.5.25 Values for each trait in three to four locations were analysed separately to detect QTLs. The LOD threshold was determined by applying 500 permutation tests with 5% probability for each trait. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by each QTL was estimated using R2 (%) value. The 95% confidence interval was used as the location of QTL, and QTLs detected in more than two different environments were considered as significant QTLs.3. Results3.1. Variation of morphological traits in RILsThe maternal parent ‘Perennial’ produces tall plants, with thin and purple-striped stems, and small leaves and flowers. ‘Perennial’ fruits are small, erect, and pungent. The paternal parent ‘Dempsey’ has relatively short plants, thick and green stems, and large leaves and flowers. ‘Dempsey’ produces large bell-type fruits that are pendent and non-pungent. We evaluated a total of 18 horticultural traits at least three different environments (Table 1), and all traits segregated in RILs generated from these two parents (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Plant height, plant width, and internode length were greatly affected by environmental conditions. The plant height of both parents and RILs was highest in environment 2012a, and lowest in environment 2011. Plant width and internode length of ‘Dempsey’ and RILs were widest and longest in environment 2012a. Immature fruit colour was segregated only in RILs grown in 2012b and 2014. Both parents had green immature fruit, whereas the RILs showed 1 : 1 segregation of light green and green colour. Phenotypic variation of ‘Perennial’, ‘Dempsey’, and RILs grown in four different environmentsP, Perennial; D, Dempsey.aMean ± standard deviation.bPhenotypes were not evaluated.Phenotypic variation of ‘Perennial’, ‘Dempsey’, and RILs grown in four different environmentsP, Perennial; D, Dempsey.aMean ± standard deviation.bPhenotypes were not evaluated.Positive and negative correlations were detected between evaluated traits (Fig. 1). In particular, fruit-related traits were highly correlated with each other compared with other traits. Fruit weight, fruit diameter, and calyx shape were positively correlated. As the fruit shape can be represented by fruit length divided by fruit diameter, it has positive and negative correlation with fruit length and fruit diameter, respectively. Flower size was positively correlated with fruit diameter and fruit weight, and negatively with main stem length. Phenotypic correlation in the parents and RILs indicated that one gene or closely linked genes control multiple fruit-related traits. Correlation between morphological traits evaluated in the RIL population. Average phenotypic values from four environments were used for Pearson correlation test. Red and blue blocks show positive and negative correlation, respectively.

Construction of bin map using low-coverage sequence‘Perennial’ and ‘Dempsey’ were sequenced with 18× coverage, whereas RILs were sequenced with 1× coverage. RILs had large amounts of missing data in SNP regions and the reliability of individual SNPs was very low due to the low coverage. Therefore, to construct an accurate ultra-high-density genetic map efficiently, we implemented a modified sliding window approach.17 Consecutive SNPs were joined in one bin, and the genotype of each bin was determined based on the ratio between SNPs from the two parents. Bins instead of individual SNPs were used as markers to increase mapping efficiency. A total of 1,431,214 SNPs were detected between ‘Perennial’ and ‘Dempsey’ and used to construct a bin map (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). Comparison of physical length and genetic distance in the bin mapComparison of physical length and genetic distance in the bin mapTo set appropriate parameters for the sliding window approach, window length from 1 to 6 Mb and step size from 0.2 to 0.5 Mb for all chromosomes were tested. Window length and step sizes of 5 and 0.5 Mb, and 4 and 0.4 Mb showed a reasonable number of recombination breakpoints per chromosome, whereas the other values showed too large or low number (data not shown). A window length of 5 Mb and a step size of 0.5 Mb gave the best match of the recombination breakpoints determined manually in five randomly selected RILs. Therefore, this parameter was used to construct a bin map.Using a sliding window approach, 3,983 recombination breakpoints were identified from 120 RILs, with an average of 33.2 per RIL (Supplementary Fig. S2A). For the RILs, the mean number of crossovers per chromosome per line was 2.8. All SNPs were grouped into 2,578 bins (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Data). The average length of bins was 1.07 Mb and ranged from 100 kb to 141 Mb (Table 3). The total genetic distance of the bin map was 1,372.2 cM, and the mean distance of the bins was 0.53 cM. On average, 564 SNPs were joined into each bin, and 54% of the bins contained <100 SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The proportion of heterozygous bins in the bin map was calculated to measure the heterozygosity of RILs (Supplementary Table S3). The average heterozygosity of the 120 RILs was 2.6%, whereas three RILs exhibited 31.8, 23.0, and 17.7% heterozygosity. Excluding these three RILs, the average heterozygosity of RILs in different generations was near 2.0%.The locations of bins in the genetic map were compared with those of the physical map based on the ‘CM334’ reference genome (Fig. 2). Inconsistencies of bin order were detected in all chromosomes and most of the inconsistencies were located near the putative centromeric regions. For example, bins located 20–40 and 60–70 Mb on chromosome 4 were inverted in location on the genetic map. Similar patterns were detected at 95–120 Mb on chromosome 3, 80–100 Mb on chromosome 7, 40–50 Mb on chromosome 9, and 110–130 Mb on chromosome 11. Extensive inconsistencies were detected on the upper region of chromosome 8. Comparison of physical map and genetic map constructed with bins.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To confirm that the bin map was constructed properly, we mapped the Pun1 gene to the bin map and compared the results with the physical location of the Pun1 gene in ‘CM334’ reference genome. Pun1 is the gene controlling pungency, and the recessive allele pun1 confers non-pungency of pepper.26 Owing to the pungent parent ‘Perennial’ and non-pungent parent ‘Dempsey’, pungency in the RILs segregated to a 1 : 1 ratio (data not shown). The Pun1 gene was mapped between PD2-bin139 and PD2-bin141 on chromosome 2 of the bin map. The physical location of PD2-bin139 and PD2-bin141 was 149.8 and 151.0 Mb, respectively. On the ‘CM334’ reference genome, the Pun1 gene is located at 152.6 Mb, 1.6 Mb from the linked bin. Thus, although there was a slight difference from the physical location, the Pun1 gene was mapped quite precisely.3.3. QTL analysisIn four environments, a total of 434 QTLs were detected, and those QTLs detected in more than two environments were selected as significant. QTLs controlling the same trait and commonly detected in different environments with overlapped 95% confidence intervals were consolidated to one QTL. A total of 86 significant QTLs controlling 17 traits were selected (Table 4 and Fig. 3). Consolidated QTLs were named based on abbreviation of the trait name and the chromosome number. For each morphological trait, 2–10 QTLs were detected and these QTLs were distributed throughout the 12 pepper chromosomes. The phenotypic variation explained by each QTL ranged from 5.6 to 63.9%. Using a threshold R2 of 10%, 32 major QTLs were identified from 13 traits. LBN-2.1 and LBN-2.2, for lateral branch number, were each detected in three environments, and their R2 value ranges were 16–40 and 10–23, respectively. These large variations in R2 value indicate that lateral branch number is highly affected by the environment. The INL-2, for internode length, and FL-3.4, for fruit length, were also each detected in three environments, but their variations of R2 were smaller compared with those of LBN-2.1 and LBN-2.2. FS-3.1, for fruit shape, FP-1, and FP-12.2, for fruit position, were identified in all environments. In particular, FP-12.2 could explain >40% of phenotypic variation, which suggests the possible existence of a major gene controlling fruit position.

Coloured bars show the location of QTLs, and the names of QTLs are listed in Table 4. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.On chromosome 3, 19 QTLs were detected and 15 of them controlled fruit-related traits (Fig. 3). Notably, 10 QTLs were located between 37.7 and 59.1 cM and all controlled fruit-related traits. FS-3.1, FS-3.2, FL-3.1, FL-3.2, and FL-3.3 had positive additive effects, meaning that RILs with the maternal genotype had higher values for fruit shape and fruit length (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). The two traits controlled by these QTLs were positively correlated with each other. CS-3.4, CS-3.5, FD-3.1, FD-3.2, and FW-3 showed negative additive effects, and the traits showed positive correlation (Supplementary Fig. S4C and D). Co-localization of correlated QTLs was detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, and 11. Most of these co-localized QTLs controlled fruit-related traits, whereas negatively correlated flower size and main stem length also showed co-localization of QTLs on chromosomes 7, 8, and 10.3.4. Anchoring of unassigned scaffoldsSequencing reads that did not map to ‘CM334’ chromosomes were realigned to the unassigned scaffolds. The longest scaffold was 3.4 Mb, and we used the assumption that there were no recombinant breakpoints within a scaffold. Therefore, scaffolds with more than 30 SNPs were used as markers. The ratio between the SNPs with ‘Perennial’ and ‘Dempsey’ genotypes was calculated to genotype the scaffolds of each RIL. Genotyped scaffolds were mapped to the bin map constructed with the sliding window approach. The number of unassigned scaffolds was 36,487, of which 263 scaffolds were anchored to the bin map. We removed 59 scaffolds that mapped to more than two chromosomes, and 204 scaffolds could ultimately be assigned using the bin map (Table 5 and Supplementary Table S4). As we used bins instead of individual SNPs, the precise position of each scaffold was not determined here. Distribution of scaffolds assigned using the bin mapDistribution of scaffolds assigned using the bin map4. DiscussionIn this work, we constructed an ultra-high-density bin map for pepper via a sliding window approach and used it to detect QTLs controlling morphological traits. Our bin map helps improve the accuracy of the pepper reference genome in two ways. First, the bins can elucidate the order of unordered scaffolds in the chromosomes. Comparison of the genetic and physical locations of bins revealed extended physical length of bins and inconsistencies for bins located near the middle of chromosomes (Fig. 2). These regions are likely centromeric or pericentromeric, as recombination rates tend to be low in the centromeric regions.27–29 In addition, unordered scaffolds are concentrated in putative centromeric regions of the reference genome.24 Thus, even though the lengths of bins in putative centromeric regions are longer than in other regions, they provide useful information for the reference genome by revealing the genetic order of bins. Second, our bin map refines the pepper reference genome by allowing us to anchor unassigned scaffolds to linkage groups. We were able to assign >200 scaffolds to chromosomes (Table 5). The total length of newly assigned scaffolds was 111 Mb, which is ~3.2% of expected pepper genome size. This result shows that genetic maps constructed using the same population and sequencing data but with a different mapping approach can improve the reference genome by anchoring unassigned scaffolds.The ultra-high-density bin map constructed in this study is the first SNP-based bin map in pepper, although the sliding window approach has been used to construct bin maps in cereal crops.17,19,20 To determine recombination breakpoints of 150 RILs in rice and 708 F2 plants in maize, 15 and 18 consecutive SNPs were used as one window in previous researches, respectively.17,20 To construct our bin map in pepper, we modified the sliding window approach. Instead of fixing the number of SNPs included in the window, we set the window length as 5 Mb. Non-uniform distributions of SNPs were detected by counting the number of SNPs in every 1.5 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S5A). When we set a window as 31 consecutive SNPs, recombination breakpoints were predicted to be excessively concentrated on regions where the density of SNPs was high (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Sequencing or genotyping error from low-coverage sequences can produce low-quality SNPs,30 and there will be high correlation between the number of SNPs and recombination breakpoints. The sliding window approach can reduce the noise created by individual SNPs, but the original (set SNP number per window) approach cannot reduce the effects of SNP density. In contrast, recombination breakpoints detected using a 5-Mb window were less affected by the density of SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Our constructed bin map contains 2,578 bins, with an average of 33 recombination breakpoints per line, similar to the bin map of rice.17 The number of recombination breakpoints was higher in rice and pepper RILs compared with that of maize F2 plants, confirming that the construction of bin maps using the sliding window approach can detect the differences in recombination frequency between RIL and F2 plants.We confirmed the accuracy of our bin map by mapping the Pun1 gene controlling pungency of pepper. There was ~1.6 Mb difference between the position in this study and the physical location of the Pun1 gene in the pepper genome. This may be caused by the misgenotyping of heterozygous Pun1/pun1 alleles as homozygous Pun1/Pun1 alleles. In this study, the Pun1 gene was genotyped using dominant molecular markers,31 but five RILs showed heterozygous bins near the Pun1 gene (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, it is highly possible that the discrepancy was due to the misgenotyped RILs. In addition to the Pun1 gene, comparisons of the location of QTLs detected in this study with those in previous studies can verify the accuracy. Here, we detected FP-12.2 as a major QTL controlling fruit position and explaining >40% of the phenotypic variation. This QTL was located at 199.6 Mb on chromosome 12 in the ‘CM334’ reference genome. The up locus that is known to control fruit position is also located on chromosome 12 by previous research.32 The physical location of the up locus-linked marker is 197.1 Mb, and this marker is 4.3 cM apart from the up locus. Thus, mapping of the Pun1 gene and the up locus using our bin map demonstrate the accuracy of the bin map, and show that QTL mapping with an ultra-high-density bin map will appropriately map the genetic locus.Fruit-related traits are of vital importance for pepper researchers and breeders. A number of QTLs controlling fruit weight, diameter, and shape have been identified in intraspecific and interspecific populations.5,7,10,33,34 In particular, QTLs controlling fruit weight were previously detected on chromosome 2.5,7,8 However, direct comparison of QTL locations has been difficult due to the lack of common markers. Therefore, we compared the physical locations of markers linked to QTLs using the ‘CM334’ reference genome sequence. fw2.1 detected in C. chinense and C. frutescens introgression lines were located between 156 and 158 Mb on chromosome 2.8 The QTL with the same name as fw2.1 was detected in a backcross population from a cross between C. annuum and C. frutescens and was also located ~156 Mb of chromosome 2.7FW-2.1 and FW-2.2, for fruit weight, detected in our research were located at 1.5 and 146 Mb, respectively. These findings show that FW-2.2 could be the same QTL as that previously reported, and that FW-2.1 is a newly detected QTL controlling fruit weight on chromosome 2. A slight difference in the physical location of FW-2.2 with fw2.1 could be caused by different statistical methods used for QTL analysis, or from the difference of the species used for the construction of genetic map. Using the same approach, we compared the location of QTLs controlling fruit shape on chromosome 3. The most tightly linked marker to the QTL, TG130, was located ~194 Mb on chromosome 3.5,7,9 In the current work, we identified FS-3.1 and FS-3.2. Due to rearrangement of bins near FS-3.1, the physical location of FS-3.1 was spread in the ranges 60–75, 98–124, and 174–200 Mb on chromosome 3. FS-3.2 was located ~206–211 Mb. It was not possible to determine whether the QTLs were the same or not, but the repeated detection of QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 3 for fruit weight and fruit shape demonstrates the significance and importance of those QTLs. Therefore, fine-mapping of FW-2.1, FW-2.2, FS-3.1, and FW-3.2 as well as comparative study with syntenic QTLs in tomato will likely be helpful to elucidate the underlying genetic factors.In summary, in this study, we identified QTLs for not only fruit-related traits but also plant architecture- and leaf-related traits. In addition, we report QTLs controlling flower-related traits in pepper for the first time. The ultra-high-density bin map we constructed using a sliding window approach improves the pepper genetic map and increases the speed of QTL mapping. This bin map will help to revise the reference genome and as all bins were determined based on SNPs, the bins can be used directly to develop molecular markers linked to QTLs.FundingThis work was carried out with the support of Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development (Plant Molecular Breeding Center No. PJ01120501 and the Agricultural Genome Center No. PJ01120401 and No. PJ01127501), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.

IntroductionThe last generations of high-throughput sequencers produce data at an unprecedented scale with associated sequencing costs in a continuous decrease. In particular, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology,1 which provides a comprehensive profile of a transcriptome, is increasingly replacing conventional expression microarrays.2 Primary data processing in RNA-seq (as well as in other massive sequencing experiments, including genome resequencing) involves mapping reads onto a reference genome. This step constitutes a computationally expensive process in which, in addition, sensitivity is a serious concern.3 A variety of programs, many of them implementing the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm that is based on an indexing method which enormously speed up the searching process, have been developed.4–8Recently proposed algorithms for DNA read mapping map ~98–99% of DNA reads (a gain of only 2% with respect to the 96% obtained by previously available mappers at a modest speedup).9–11 Thus, the current software provides a reasonably quick and sensitive framework for read mapping in DNA resequencing experiments. However, the scenario in RNA-seq is far from these standards. Mapping sequencing reads in the context of transcripts is a much more complex problem than simply mapping reads onto the genomic sequence, as in the case of genome resequencing experiments. Eukaryotic transcriptomes are complex, with an average of more than nine transcripts per gene12 with exons of 250 bp on the average that span over several hundreds of kilobases, and more new transcript isoforms are continuously being discovered.13 It has been reported that widely used mappers, such as TopHat,14 can hardly reach 70% of 100 bp reads correctly mapped in a realistic scenario with sequencing errors, while the best sensitivity (82%) is attained by GSNAP.15 Although GSNAP seems to display a lower sensitivity in an ideal error-free scenario.16 According to this last report, other RNA-seq mappers like RUM,17 STAR,18 or MapSplice19 align sequencing reads with even lower accuracy. However, more recent reports20 support a better performance of STAR18 or MapSplice19 with respect to the other methods, in agreement with earlier benchmarks.17 Moreover, as read length increases (the natural trend of the continuous upgrades of sequencing instruments), the sensitivity of the methods drops down, causing serious problems in terms of sensitivity and runtime.16 Mapping is actually problematic with most BWT-based mappers, because they often allow only a small number of mismatches (insufficient for the current read lengths even in scenarios of low variability). New aligners, such TopHat2,14 which uses the new Bowtie2,10 have significantly accelerated the mapping step (with a small trade-off in sensitivity), although the strategy for junction detection remains unchanged. While this study was under review, a new mapper was published, HISAT,21 that combines the BWT and the Ferragina-Manzini index in its indexing scheme. Similarly, this speedup that shows this program seems to be attained at the exchange of a trade-off in sensitivity.Despite the interest in the use of RNA-seq for transcriptome analysis and the advancements in algorithms either for quantifying reads22,23 or for transcript discovery,24 the basic problem of mapping reads in the context of transcripts is far from being solved.Here, we propose an innovative solution for high-quality mapping of both short and long reads, based on a combination of mapping with BWT and local alignment with Smith-Waterman (SW), that drastically increases mapping accuracy (95 versus 60–85% by current mappers, in the most common scenarios) and substantially reduces runtimes (by about 15× when compared with TopHat2, 8× with MapSplice and 2× with STAR). In addition, the proposed strategy has also demonstrated to be quite robust against indels and mismatches. This proposal provides a simple, fast and elegant solution that maps almost all the reads, even those containing a high number of mismatches or indels. This solution also saves a substantial amount of time in the mapping step which, consequently, critically contributes to the acceleration of the current pipelines of sequencing data processing. This strategy, implemented in a program that makes use of different high-performance computing (HPC) technologies, HPG Aligner, shows an excellent performance with both, short and long reads, with runtimes presenting only a linear dependence with the number of reads.2. MethodsMost modern mappers rely on the BWT indexing method to speed up the searching process. However, speedup by indexing is achieved at the exchange of sensitivity, which decreases as read length increases, since most common BWT implementations only allow a limited number of mismatches. On the other side of the spectrum, the well-known BLAST mapper25 uses SW as a local alignment algorithm, which presents a high sensitivity, being able to map reads with many mismatches or indels. However, its performance in terms of runtimes makes BLAST unsuitable for mapping the huge number of reads produced in next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments.Here, we have brought together the best of both algorithms: the performance of BWT and the sensitivity of SW, by implementing a combined strategy that allows an ultrafast and high sensitivity read mapping, even in the presence of high proportions of mutations and indels. The algorithm proposed also deals very efficiently with the problem of introns, no matter that only a small fragment of the end of the read is contained in the next exon. This is achieved by using a highly efficient data structure, which we called ‘metaexon’, that learns from high-quality mapped reads and helps to map low-quality or more complex reads. This metaexon structure stores information of the genomic coordinates and the number of aligned reads with low memory requirements (Supplementary Fig. S1). By doing so, the proportion of hard and soft clipping is drastically reduced.The aligning process is completed in two main steps: first, our BWT implementation, based on a previous version for exact alignment,26 is used to map reads containing up to two mismatches (BWT index is built with a default factor of 8). The resulting high-quality alignment information is stored in the metaexon data structure. Secondly, reads containing more than two mismatches, indels or introns are mapped following a multi-stage process: (i) contiguous seeds are generated covering the whole read and also two more reads overlapping the beginning and end of the read are generated (Fig. 1). These overlapping seeds will help to align multi-exon covering reads. A seed size of 16 nucleotides (nt) represents a good trade-off between performance and sensitivity. These seeds are mapped using BWT, with no mismatches allowed. (ii) Seeds mapping at distances closer than a read length and with the same strand orientation are brought together to generate candidate alignment locations (labelled as candidate alignment location in Fig. 1); (iii) candidate alignment locations are clustered together to define transcripts providing they are closer than 500,000 nt and in the same strand orientation. Note that several clusters can be obtained from the candidate alignment locations; (iv) for each cluster, the gaps produced by either not aligned seeds or exon–intron boundaries are aligned using a HPC implementation of SW. This implementation uses Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions, which allow mismatches and indels and present a high sensitivity to determine intron boundaries. For aligning seeds mapping at the ends of the exons, the metaexon data structure is queried to obtain candidate exon junctions. Using this simple strategy, HPG Aligner can provide a high-quality alignment for spliced reads; (v) finally, a score is obtained and the alignments are reported. Schema of the implementation of the mapping process. (Top) Contiguous seeds of size (16 bp) are taken covering the whole read. Also, two more overlapping seeds near the ends of the read are taken for anchoring the ends to the exons. (Middle) Seeds are mapped without allowing any mismatch. Seeds mapped closer than read size and, in the same strand orientation, constitute a candidate alignment location (CAL). (Bottom) CALs closer than 500,000 bp and, in the same strand orientation, are clustered to form candidate exons and transcripts. These are evaluated and scores based on SW are assigned to them.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Due to the HPC implementation, we have devised a simple but powerful strategy in which the original high sensitivity of the algorithms is maintained without sacrificing performance. HPG Aligner can map reads containing many mismatches and indels, which can cover one or more introns. The algorithms have been implemented in the most convenient accelerator hardware. Thus, BWT has been implemented in two ways: in a multi-thread library that exploits the modern multicore CPUs and also using Nvidia CUDA library for GPUs. Both implementations can be executed simultaneously to obtain higher performance. On the other hand, SW benefits from the parallelism of SIMD registers present in each core of modern CPUs and has been implemented using SSE4 instructions.The performance of HPG aligner was greatly improved with the implementation of some specific strategies to overcome the bottlenecks detected in the alignment process. Most significant implementation improvements include: (i) the use of a custom SW implementation based on multisequence vectors;27 during the alignment, SW executions are buffered to execute them in parallel. (ii) Grouping seeds that map close in the genome (conceptually similar to clustering) was an expensive operation. This was easily solved by storing all the seeds from different chromosomes independently and sorted. (iii) BWT is a very fast algorithm and a significant fraction of the FASTQ file could be aligned with less than two mismatches. Therefore, reads are aligned with BWT before seeding. When the alignment fails (because there are more than two mismatches), the aligned part of the read is still stored as a seed (i.e. if after BWT there are 40 bp exact alignment, then this is considered a seed.). (iv) The metaexon data structure (see above and Supplementary Fig. S1) reduces the computing time for some of the more difficult alignments.To improve the overall performance of the implementation, several advanced tools for high-performance profiling were used during the development (in particular, Paraver http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/performance-tools/paraver and Extrae http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/extrae). These tools revealed that some steps of the internal pipeline were not taking fully advantage of the hardware resources. A dynamic runtime engine was developed and built inside HPG Aligner.28 Each of the steps of the pipeline were considered as a task that needs some resource to be executed. Requested resources were assigned by the engine runtime in a dynamic and efficient way. In this way, the computing resources (such as cores) are assigned to the different tasks in an optimal way to avoid some cores to be waiting for other tasks to finish. This is a more complex implementation, which can usually be found in HPC applications. This allowed us to increase significantly the performance.By leveraging the HPC implementation, the software runs many times faster than any other currently available solution and, in addition, it presents much higher sensitivity. Moreover, this implementation has proved to be technically much more efficient than current state-of-the art implementations since (i) the requirement of memory is much lower and it is kept below 10 GB, (ii) scalability in a multicore CPUs (up to 24 cores) is maintained and (iii) no large secondary indices or ‘temp’ files are generated during the execution, so no extra hard disk space is required.2.1. Paired and unpaired RNA-seq simulated datasets comparisonWe have used two popular programs for the simulations of paired and unpaired reads from the human transcriptome: BEERS (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/BEERS/), a simulator specifically devised to produce mRNA populations17 and also the popular dwgsim 0.1.8 from SAMtools (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/dnaa/index.php?title=Whole_Genome_Simulation).Using BEERS, we generated 10 million reads for 10,000 genes in a duplicate of all the simulations, that is, FastQ files of 50, 75, 100, 150, 250 and 400 bp long, with different error ratios (0.001, 0.01 and 0.02 corresponding to 0.1, 1 and 2% mismatches, respectively). In all the configurations, the fraction of mutations that are indels was set to 10%.The program dwgsim was run in ‘Illumina’ mode with option ‘-c 0’ for the six different length sizes tested. To study sensitivity against mutations and N's present in reads, three quality configurations were tested. First, a high-quality dataset containing 0.1% of mutations and a maximum of 2 N's per read was generated with options ‘-r 0.001 -n 2’. For the second and third datasets, higher proportion of mutations and N's were allowed to increase up to 1 and 2% of mutations, respectively, and 3 N's per read with options ‘-r 0.01 -n 3’ and ‘-r 0.02 -n 3’. In both configurations, the fraction of mutations that are indels was set to 10% with option ‘-R 0.1’.The coordinates for cDNA sequences were taken from Ensembl 68 built upon GRCh37. For all combinations of length sizes and quality configurations, single-end and paired-end datasets were generated. For paired-end datasets, the inner distance between reads was set to 400 for reads smaller than 250 nt and a distance of 250 for the datasets of 250 and 400 length sizes.Human assembly GRCh37.p8 was taken from Ensembl 68. HPG Aligner was run in ‘rna’ mode. The default command line parameters for the programs can be found in Supplementary data.Benchmarks were performed in a high-end machine with two hexa-core Intel Xeon E5645 2.40 GHz CPUs and 48 GB of memory. All executions were done using the 12 cores available and memory use was monitored. HPG Aligner showed a memory peak of 10 GB.All the FastQ file generated in the simulations and the BAM files generated in the benchmarking are available at: http://bioinfo.cipf.es/publications/supplementary_material.2.2. Real RNA-seq datasets comparisonTo test short- and long-read alignment with real data, two different datasets from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) were used, and the first dataset tested was SRR364003 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRR364003) sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and contained 81.6 million single and paired-end short reads of 100 nt length; the second dataset was built by combining the two runs of SRX025091 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX025091) sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX platform; in total, a dataset of 1.26 million of single-end reads of about sequences, 600 nt long, was obtained.The programs were run using default command line options in a single and paired-end mode (see above). Evaluation was performed by counting as correctly mapped the number of reads mapping within known transcript positions. The known transcripts are taken from Ensembl.29 Benchmarks were performed in a high-end machine with two hexa-core Intel Xeon E5645 2.40 GHz CPUs and 48 GB of memory.3. Results3.1. Performance of the method: speed and sensitivityWe have compared the proposed aligner with the most extensively used RNA-seq mapper, TopHat214 (version 2.0.9), STAR18 (version 2.3.0), MapSplice19 (version 2.1.3) and HISAT21 in simulated datasets with 10 million reads of lengths of 50, 75, 100, 150, 250 and 400 nt, in three scenarios of variability (0.1, 1 and 2% of mismatches, 10% of these being indels). Simulations were initially carried out with the BEERS program (see the Methods section).Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of the proposed aligner, measured as the number of reads generated by BEERS correctly mapped (that is, mapping correctly the start and end and covering splice sites in between). HPG Aligner outperforms TopHat2 with Bowtie 2, HISAT (except in unrealistic scenarios of no error with read lengths of 150 and 250), STAR and MapSplice, even when mapping short reads (see details in Table 1) and, as read length grows and the error rate increases, the difference in sensitivity increases even more. In current conventional lengths (100 bp) in an ideal scenario of low error, performances are quite similar (95–96%). However, if error is a bit higher (1%), HPG Aligner and MapSplice 2 maintain the sensitivity (94.50 and 95.34%, respectively). At this read length, TopHat2 and STAR sensitivities drop to a lower, but still reasonable value of ~87%. For longer reads, the difference in sensitivity between HPG Aligner and STAR with respect to TopHat2 and MapSplice 2 grows considerably in scenarios of moderate error (see Table 1 reads 250 or 400 long at errors 1 or 2%). TopHat2 presents a peculiar behaviour: it keeps an extraordinarily low ratio of incorrect read mapping (below 2%) at the exchange of increasing the number of unmapped reads, which arrives to 27.13% for read lengths of 150 bp and 1% error and 53.29% for 250 bp (same error). It is remarkable that HPG Aligner, STAR and MapSplice keep the number of unmapped read below 5% across all the range of read lengths. Regarding runtimes, HPG Aligner runs much faster, ranging from 7× to almost than 10× for read lengths of 50–150, respectively, for TopHat2, 7× in the case of MapSplice and 2× in the case of STAR. HISAT runtimes are similar, although a bit slower, except in the case of very short reads (not produces anymore by modern sequencers), in which it is slightly faster than HPG Aligner.

The colour code corresponds to the different programs. In all the cases, HPG Aligner sensibilities and runtimes were better than the ones shown by the rest of programs (Supplementary Table S1). These differences increase as read length and error increase.Representation of mapping sensitivity (percentage of reads correctly mapped) versus runtimes (in min) for simulated datasets of different single read lengths (from 50 bp, upper left, to 400 bp, lower right) containing 10 million single-end reads in two scenarios of variability (low variability represented by circles and high variability represented by triangles). The colour code corresponds to the different programs. In all the cases, HPG Aligner sensibilities and runtimes were better than the ones shown by the rest of programs (Supplementary Table S1). These differences increase as read length and error increase.We repeated the simulations in the same conditions with the dwgsim simulator (see the Methods section). The results obtained in the transcriptomics simulated scenario provided by dwgsim are similar although the percentages of correct mapping decrease for all the programs across the wide range of lengths (Supplementary Table S1). In particular, the sensitivity of TopHat2 notably decreases in the low variability (0.1%). As noise and read length increase, the sensitivity falls down again. One of the reasons for this general decrease in the sensitivity can be the fact that dwgsim has an extra parameter that accounts for the error of the sequencing technology, which introduces an extra amount of mismatches per read. As expected, the results obtained in the case of paired reads were quite similar (Supplementary Table S2).Actually, sequencing technologies are progressively increasing the read length (currently, HiSeq 2500 or HiSeq 1500 in rapid run mode produces read lengths of 150 bp, 454 GS FLX+ Lifesciences average read length is of 700–800 bp and Pacific Biosciences is over 3 Kb). Therefore, a desirable property for aligners is robustness against increasingly large sequence lengths.When the five aligners are tested against a real dataset of 20 million reads, 100 bp long, from an Illumina HiSeq (SRA accession SRR364003), HPG Aligner was able to map at known transcript positions almost 80% of the reads, whereas HISAT and MapSplice reached ~76%, STAR 72% and TopHat2 only reached 63%. In terms of runtimes, HPG Aligner, HISAT and STAR are >10 times faster than TopHat2 and MapSplice (~10 versus over 100 min; Table 2). When a dataset with longer reads, obtained with 454 GS FLX+ Lifesciences (average 600 bp), was analysed (SRA accession SRP003173), the number of reads mapped by HPG Aligner reduces to ~50%, while STAR only reached 30%, HISAT and TopHat almost none and MapSplice did not get any result after 3 days running (Table 2). Real RNA-seq datasets taken from sequence read archive (SRA)SRA SRP009262 study was sequenced with Illumina HiSeq and contains 81.6 M reads (20 M reads are used for the benchmarking) of 100 nt length. Aligners were run in single and paired-end mode. SRA SRP003173 study was sequenced with Roche 454 GS FLX and contains 1.26 M reads (1,265,460) of ~600 nt.For each program, the table contains the following columns with the percentages of: RNM: reads not mapped; CMR: correctly mapped reads (mapped reads that cover the corresponding to known transcript positions).

Table 3 summarizes the different behaviours of the four aligners tested. HPG Aligner and HISAT clearly render much better runtimes than the rest of programs. Scalability with the number of readsRuntimes for producing a BAM file (in min) of the different aligners in datasets of growing size.Scalability with the number of readsRuntimes for producing a BAM file (in min) of the different aligners in datasets of growing size.We have also assessed the performance of the method in specifically mapping reads containing splice junctions. Two sets containing 5 million reads 100 bp long, spliced and non-spliced, respectively, were constructed. Runtimes obtained were very similar (220.61 s non-spliced versus 222.45 s spliced). We repeated the simulation with longer reads (250 bp) obtaining a similar result (485.56 s non-spliced versus 488.74 s spliced).3.2. Other technical advantagesIn addition, the implementation presented here has additional advantages. The program can directly read gzipped, FASTQ files saving in this way both disc space and the time required for the decompression. It is also able to directly generate BAM formats, saving the SAM to BAM conversion step. From a technical point of view, the use of memory is highly efficient and can be managed by the user. For example, HPG Aligner only needs 9 GB of RAM in the analysis of the simulations shown in Fig. 2, whereas TopHat2 and STAR require 35 GB. HPC implementation guarantees that software will have a good runtime performance in most modern and future CPUs and GPUs. HPG Aligner scales quite efficiently with the number of cores (threads), which is a desirable property in a scenario in which the deep of sequencing (number of reads sequenced) reveals as a crucial factor to properly measure differential expression.22 Source code and development process have been opened to the community and released in GitHub; biologist and computational researchers are encouraged to use and contribute to HPG Aligner.3.3. Program availabilityHPG Aligner is free and open source. Documentation and software are available at: https://github.com/opencb/hpg-aligner/wiki.4. DiscussionTranscriptomic studies are nowadays essential for understanding biological mechanisms.30 For most than one decade, expression microarrays have been the dominant technology for transcriptomic analysis. However, in a quick technological transition, RNA-seq is becoming today the mainstream technology. The continuous upgrades of NGS technologies result in an increase of both throughput and read lengths. This trend requires of algorithms able to efficiently and accurately process an increasing number of reads of increasing length. Current algorithms present serious limitations in both aspects, which preclude an optimal use of RNA-seq technologies.Mapping sequencing reads in the context of transcripts is a problem of much higher complexity than simply mapping reads onto the genomic sequence, as in the case of genome resequencing experiments. Eukaryotic transcriptomes are complex, with an average of more than nine transcripts per gene12 with exons of 250 bp on the average that span over several hundreds of kilobases, and more new transcript isoforms are continuously being discovered.13 Particularly, splices near the ends of reads can be especially difficult to align, given that a minimum amount of sequence is needed to confidently identify exon boundaries.20 Accurate mapping of both short and long reads as well as a precise detection of potential splice junctions are crucial for accurate transcript isoform definition, which is essential for a proper RNA-seq data analysis.In addition, new strategies to speed up runtimes are needed. Brute-force scaling-up strategies that rely only in the use of more powerful computers are expensive, inefficient and unsustainable. Contrarily, algorithmic solutions that take advantage of the intrinsic parallelism of NGS data and exploit the different possibilities of parallelization in the hardware used (multicore CPUs, SIMD and GPUs) offer a promising solution to the problem of the ever-growing genomic data. Actually, given the trend of increasing the number of cores in the new CPUs, scalability becomes a desirable property for any algorithm that aims to cope with the future growing sequencing datasets.Recent comparative analysis reported that STAR18 or MapSplice19 performed better than other methods. Here, we have shown how the proposed approach is faster and more accurate than these ones over a wide range of read lengths and errors. Summarizing, here we present a solution for RNA-seq short-read mapping, which is optimal in terms of speed and accuracy alignment. This solution is robust to growing read lengths, it is highly sensitive to indels, and from a technological point of view, it is quite effective in memory management and efficiently scalable to many cores or processors. All these properties make of HPG Aligner, a particularly suitable solution for the analysis of current and future sequencing datasets.FundingThis work is supported by grants from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (BIO2014-57291-R) and co-funded with European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), AECID (D/016099/08) and from the Conselleria d'Educacio of the Valencian Community (PROMETEOII/2014/025).

IntroductionThe MYB (myeloblastosis) transcription factors (TF) are widely distributed in all eukaryotic organisms and comprise one of the largest TF families in the plant kingdom.1 MYB proteins are characterized by a highly conserved MYB-DNA-binding domain located near the N-terminus. The MYB domain consists of 1–4 imperfect tandem repeats (designated R0, R1, R2, and R3) with each repeat containing ~50 amino acids and encoding three a-helices.2 Typically, the MYB repeat contains three regularly spaced tryptophan (or phenylalanine) residues, which can form a hydrophobic core, and therefore stabilizes the structure of the DNA-binding domain. The MYB gene family is usually divided into four different subfamilies according to the number of MYB repeat in the MYB domain, namely R1R2R3-MYB (3R-MYB), R2R3-MYB (2R-MYB), and 4R-MYB containing three, two, and four MYB repeats, respectively; as well as the MYB-related subfamily usually, but not always has a single repeat.2 Compared with animal MYB proteins, which generally referred to as 3R-MYB proteins, the majority of MYB TFs in plants are either R2R3-MYB or R1-MYB types.2,3 For example, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains only five 3R-MYB genes, compared with up to 126 R2R3-MYB and 64 MYB-related genes.2,3 Meanwhile, the rice genome contains 109 R2R3-MYB genes, 70 MYB-related genes, five 3R-MYB genes, and only one 4R-MYB gene.2,4 The expansion of the R2R3-MYB gene family in plants fits well with the observation that many (if not all) R2R3-MYB TF play central roles in plant-specific processes.2 It is proposed that the plant R2R3-MYB genes probably evolved from an R1R2R3-MYB gene progenitor through loss of R1 repeat or from an R1-MYB gene through duplication of R1 repeat.5The first cloned plant MYB gene, C1, was identified from maize (Zea mays) and encodes a c-myb-like transcription factor involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.6 Since then, an increasing number of MYB genes have been identified and characterized in numerous plants, including several crop plants.3,7 It has been demonstrated that MYB TF play a key role in many aspects of plant growth, development, and response to abiotic and biotic stresses.1,2Extensive studies of MYB gene family in model plant species have provided a better understanding of roles and underlining mechanisms of this gene family. However, little is known about this gene family in canola or oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). So far, there are only two reports on MYB genes in canola, in which two MYB genes were cloned and studied in the context of phosphate starvation and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis.8,9 Canola is a very important oil crop worldwide, and its yield is frequently limited by environmental factors including drought, salinity, cold, and fungal pathogens. However, the identity and role of MYB genes in canola responses to abiotic and biotic stresses are largely unknown. It is therefore necessary to characterize the MYB gene family in canola to help to develop stress- or disease-tolerant cultivars. In our previous transcriptomic profiling studies in canola seedlings treated with a fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and drought stress, we identified several MYB genes induced by S. sclerotiorum and/or drought stress.10 Hence, to explore the role of MYB genes in canola, we mined the available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) deposited in the public database to identify expressed R2R3-MYB genes in canola. We further cloned the cDNA sequences of 44 R2R3-MYB genes from canola. After analyzing the transcriptional activity of these MYB proteins in yeast, we also examined the responses of selected genes under a range of abiotic stress and hormone treatment conditions. Interestingly, we successfully identified one novel BnaMYB gene that could elicit cell death when expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Our data presented here will lay a solid foundation for further characterization of this important MYB gene family in canola responses to abiotic and biotic stresses.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of ESTs for R2R3-MYB genes in canolaThe seed sequences of MYB domain (Pf00249) from Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family/MYB#tabview=tab0) and the cDNA sequences of R2R3-MYB genes of Arabidopsis were used to search the B. napus ESTs in the NCBI dbEST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html, release 01012013), with an e-value cut-off lower than 10-4. After manual curation, these ESTs were clustered and assembled by sequence alignment program of DNASTAR (DNASTAR Inc.). Subsequently, contigs and singletons were run in a reciprocal BLAST search against the Arabidopsis database to assign a putative orthologue based on the best hit (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. Plant growth condition, RNA extraction, and RT–PCRCanola plants were grown in Pindstrup soil mix (Denmark) in a growth chamber at 22°C with 16 h light/8 h dark. Eighteen-day-old leaves were harvested for RNA isolation using the Plant RNA kit (Omega, USA). First-strand cDNA synthesis and high-fidelity PCR amplification using PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) were performed as previously described.11 Primers used were listed in Supplementary Table S2. PCR products were purified and cloned into pJET1.2 vector (Fermentas, USA). At least two clones for each gene were sequenced. The cDNA sequences of genes cloned in this study were deposited in GenBank database under the accession numbers of KC966733–KC966744, KF738279–KF738288, KF974750–KF974754, KJ670116–KJ670120, KM975652–KM975666, KR076547–KR076552, and KT350982.2.3. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction and bioinformatic analysisThe MYB genes of representative species were identified using a previously constructed domain alignment (from the Pfam database version 27.0) to query the proteome of representative species in Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.com/, v9.0). To investigate the evolutionary relationship among MYBs, the predicted amino acid sequences of MYBs of canola and other species were aligned using ClustalX1.83 and then a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the maximum parsimony (MP) algorithm implemented in MEGA6.06 (release 6140226). Motif analysis of BnaMYBs was determined by using Prosite program (http://prosite.expasy.org/prosite.html) and SMART tool (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de). The respective domains of MYB proteins were aligned using ClutsalX1.83 and illustrated by Boxshade (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The putative orthologue of each BnaMYB was identified by the InParanoid server v. 8.0 (http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/blast_search.cgi).2.4. Transactivation assayThe coding regions of canola MYB genes were cloned in-frame downstream of GAL4 binding domain of the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech, USA), using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. Then the recombinant plasmids were transformed individually into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) AH109 competent cells according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech, USA). The transcriptional activity of BnaMYBs was tested as described previously.122.5. Quantitative RT–PCR assayEighteen-day-old canola grown in a greenhouse with photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark with a relative humidity of 60% were treated with different stress conditions including 200 mM NaCl, 50 µM abscisic acid (±ABA, Invitrogen, USA), 10 µM methyl viologen (MV, Sigma-Aldrich), 4°C (cold), 37°C (heat), or drought as described previously.11 Three independent biological replicates of each sample were prepared at different times.Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (qRT–PCR) was performed using 10-fold diluted cDNA and SYBR Green I kit (CWBIO, China) on the CFX96 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad, USA). Primers used for qRT–PCR were designed using PrimerSelect program (DNASTAR Inc., USA), which targeted mainly at 3'UTR with an amplicon size of 75–250 bp (Supplementary Table S2). The specificity and amplification efficiency of each pair of primers were examined through both BLASTn search in NCBI database and by running standard curves with melting curves. Three independent biological replicates and two technical replicates for each biological replicate were run, and the significance was determined through t-test of SPSS statistic software (P = 0.05).2.6. Subcellular localization and confocal microscopyTo examine the localization of selected BnaMYBs, the coding regions were amplified using Pfu polymerase (Bioer, China) with primers listed in the Supplementary Table S2. After purification, PCR products were restricted and then cloned upstream of a synthetic green fluorescent protein gene (sGFP) in the pYJGFP binary vector. These constructs and p19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 individually through a freeze-thaw method, and overnight cell cultures were resuspended in infiltration media before infiltration into 30-day-old leaves of N. benthamiana.11 Two days later, leaf discs were observed of GFP under FV1000MPE confocal microscopy (Olympus, Japan).2.7. Transient expression and physiological assayThe coding regions of respective genes were amplified by high-fidelity Pfu polymerase and primers containing corresponding restriction sites as listed in Supplementary Table S2. After digestion, the PCR products were inserted downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter in the binary vector pYJHA, which was modified from the pYJGFP vector. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into A. tumefaciens GV3101 and overnight cell cultures were resuspended in infiltration media containing 10 mM MES-KOH (pH 5.6), 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.15 mM acetosyringon, which was adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5 before a mixture of equal volumes of each cell culture harbouring p19, and BnaMYB gene were infiltrated into the lower epidermal side of 30-day-old leaves of N. benthamiana plants. For each construct, 15 independent leaves of five independent plants (three leaves per plant) were used for each time point tested. After that, infiltrated plants were kept under normal growth condition with the phenotype observed and recorded daily beginning 2 days after infiltration and continuing until Day 7.Electrolyte leakage was measured according to Ref. 13. Distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was detected by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining according to the previously described protocol.13 Total chlorophyll was extracted in absolute ethanol in the dark at 4°C. Relative chlorophyll levels were determined by fluorescence using a spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Anthocyanins were extracted in methanol supplemented with 1% HCl overnight at 4°C with absorbance at 530 and 657 nm measured using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). By subtracting the A657 from the A530, the relative amount of anthocyanin per milligram of tissue was calculated. For malondialdehyde (MDA) content determination, ~100 mg of leaf discs were homogenized in 4 ml of 0.1% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), with the concentration measured as described previously.142.8. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assaysFirstly, a ß-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fragment (2.053 kb) was amplified from pCAMBIA1391Z through high-fidelity Pfu and subcloned into Nco I-Sal I sites of pYJHA plasmid using the same restriction sites, with the resultant transient vector called pYJHA-GUS. An agrobacterial GV3101-mediated infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves was performed as described previously. Leaves from control (GUS) and BnaMYB78 plants were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS buffer and treated with DNase-free RNase A (30 µg/ml; Promega) and Proteinase K (20 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min before the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay according to the manufacturer's manual (Promega). Tissue was then counterstained with Vectashield and DAPI solution (Vector Labs, USA) for 5–10 min and examined with an FV1000MPE confocal microscopy (Olympus, Japan).2.9. Promoter cloning and dual luciferase assayYoung leaves of N. benthamiana or canola seedlings were harvested for DNA isolation through the 2% CTAB method.14 Primers for amplification of promoter regions were designed through a BLAST search against the SOL Genomics Network database (http://solgenomics.net/tools/blast) based on orthologous published sequences of Nicotiana tabacum and/or Arabidopsis. Promoter regions of canola genes were retrieved from B. napus database (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/). High-fidelity PCR amplification was performed using PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan). Primers were designed to amplify the 1 kb regions upstream of the translational start codon (ATG) and were listed in Supplementary Table S2. PCR products were purified, sequenced and fused upstream of firefly luciferase (fLUC) gene in the pGreenII0800-LUC vector, in which renilla luciferase (rLUC) under the control of the 35S promoter was the endogenous control. The effector plasmid is pYJHA-BnaMYB78 and the control plasmid is pYJGFP. Dual LUC assay was performed as described previously.15 Briefly, agrobacterium cultures transformed with the effector plasmid and reporter plasmid (9 : 1, v/v) were co-infiltrated into the lower epidermal side of 30-day-old N. benthamiana leaves. At specific time points, 1 cm leaf discs were harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in 200 µl of lysis buffer, with supernatant used to assay fLUC and rLUC activity using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), with a 5 s delay and 15 s integrated measurements. The binding ability of BnaMYB78 to various promoter regions was indicated by the ratio of fLUC to rLUC. Triplicate measurements were performed for each pair. The promoter sequences cloned in this study were deposited in GenBank database under the accession numbers of KP747643, KP747648, KT257630 and KT907304–KT907305, KT907307–KT907308.2.10. Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated three times (three biological replicates). All data were statistically analysed by using t-test or Duncana analysis of the SPSS 16.0 software.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification and cloning of R2R3-MYB genes from canolaTo identify and characterize R2R3-MYB genes from canola, we utilized the large number of public ESTs and identified 527 unique ESTs representing putative R2R3-MYB genes in canola (Supplementary Table S1). We followed the united nomenclature for Brassica genus genes and used BnaMYB (for B. napus MYB, to differentiate it from Brassica nigra) to represent MYB genes from canola.16 To facilitate comparisons between species, we followed the established nomenclature of Arabidopsis MYBs when naming the canola MYB genes.1 As a result, we identified 76 R2R3-MYB genes from canola. We noticed that, among all the BnaMYB genes identified, BnaMYB44 had the largest number (50) of ESTs, followed by BnaMYB77 and -91 with a total of 37 and 34 ESTs, respectively; while 16 BnaMYB genes have only one EST each (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). To facilitate functional study of BnaMYB genes, we employed RT–PCR to obtain full-length cDNA sequences from canola, at least for the coding regions. As a result, we succeeded in cloning the cDNA sequences of 44 BnaMYB genes and deposited them into GenBank, among which we identified two to three different alleles for nine BnaMYB genes (Table 1). Conceptual translation of these cDNA sequences and domain analysis indicated that they harbour domains and motifs that are typical of R2R3-MYB proteins (Supplementary Figure S1). Further analysis showed that only the R2 and R3 repeats are highly conserved among the 54 BnaMYB protein sequences, whereas the C-terminal sequences are highly variable and no conserved motif could be detected (Supplementary Figure S1). The numbers of amino acids in BnaMYB proteins range from 236 (BnaMYB59) to 439 (BnaMYB88), with a pI of 4.82 (BnaMYB58) to 9.4 (BnaMYB123). Using the program InParanoid, we also identified putative orthologues of these BnaMYB genes in monocot model plant rice (Table 1).

Domain analysis of BnaMYB proteins and phylogenetic tree reconstructionR2R3-MYBs are characterized with two repeats, known as R2 and R3. Consistently, the MYB domain of canola R2R3-MYBs contains 107 amino acid residues, of which 56 form R2, while the other 51 constitute R3 (Supplementary Fig. S2). To examine the sequence features of MYB domains and the degree of conservation of each residue, we performed multiple sequence alignment with sequence logos created for R2 and R3 of R2R3-MYBs from canola (Supplementary Fig. S2). The results showed that the R2 repeat of canola R2R3-MYBs contains three highly conserved tryptophan residues (W) at positions 6, 27 and 49, which may form a tryptophan cluster in the 3-dimensional helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure and play significant roles in MYB-DNA interaction.1 In contrast, only two regularly spaced and highly conserved tryptophan residues exist at positions 25 and 44 of R3 (Supplementary Fig. S2). As known from orthologues in other plant species, we also identified that the first tryptophan residue in the R3 repeat (position 6) is not conserved at all, instead it could be replaced by phenylalanine (F) or less frequently by isoleucine (I) or leucine (L), which was also reported in other plants.17–19 Interestingly, the last of the conserved tryptophan residues at the position 44 of the R3 repeat is not completely conserved in the canola R2R3-MYBs (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Fig. S2). Instead, a phenylalanine (F) residue was found in BnaMYB88 and BnaMYB124, and this phenomenon was ever reported in other plants as well.19,20 However, the functional significance of phenylalanine at position 44 of R3 repeat remains to be elucidated. Overall, the highly conserved amino acid residues are mainly located in the third helix (Helix 3) and the turn of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (Supplementary Fig. S2). Besides, the residues forming the first helix in each repeat are apparently less conserved (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the 3' region of R2 in canola R2R3-MYBs contains a highly conserved LRPD motif, which was also observed in R2R3-MYBs from Populus trichocarpa21 and sugar beet.19To infer the evolutionary relationship of canola R2R3-MYBs to those of other representative crops and model plants and trace the origin and expansion of R2R3-MYB genes, we searched putative MYB genes in representative, lower species using Pfam seed sequences in Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net). The species queried included the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii (Sm), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr) and Ostreococcus lucimarinus (Ot). Among these, the marine green alga Ostreococcus tauri (Ot) is the world's smallest free-living eukaryote known to date.22 As a result, three, three and six R2R3-type MYB genes were identified from O. tauri, C. reinhardtii and S. moellendorffii, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). This suggests that R2R3-type MYB genes have an ancient origin. In addition, the presence of a smaller set of R2R3-type MYB members in primitive land plants including S. moellendorffii compared with eudicots (Arabidopsis) and monocots (rice) indicated significant expansion of the R2R3-MYB genes during the evolution of the angiosperms.Further, a maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using MEGA6.0 based on the full-length protein sequences of R2R3-MYBs from canola, Arabidopsis, rice, wheat, maize, P. trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera as well as a few from published references (Fig. 1). In two previous studies of Arabidopsis R2R3-MYBs, 90 of the 126 R2R3-MYBs were grouped into 25 subfamilies (S1-S25). However, the remaining 36 genes were not clustered into any subgroups.1,2 To better compare our results with these previous studies, we labelled the subgroups as previously defined (Fig. 1). It can be seen that most canola R2R3-MYB can be classified into 19 subgroups and a few BnaMYBs do not belong to any subgroup. Moreover, most of the subgroups were supported by high bootstrapping values. Phylogenetic analysis of canola R2R3-MYB proteins.

Transcriptional activity of BnaMYB TFTo explore the function of MYB genes in canola, it is necessary to identify whether they are transcriptional activators or repressors. Therefore, we analysed the ability of 36 selected BnaMYB TFs to activate three reporter genes LacZ, His1 and ADE2 in budding yeast. Firstly, the coding regions of BnaMYB genes were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) to examine their ability to activate transcription from the GAL4 upstream activation sequence (UAS) and thereby promote yeast growth. The yeast cells containing individual BnaMYB plasmids or control plasmid pGBKT7 all grew well on the non-selective SD-LW medium, while on selective SD-LWHA medium, only yeast cells transformed with pGBKT7-BnaMYB1, -12, -13, -15, -16, -30, -31, -34, -43, -46, -47, -51, -61, -78, -81, -88, -90, -95, -96, -106, -108, -109, -111, -116, -122 and -124 plasmids could grow (Fig. 2), suggesting that these BnaMYB TFs are likely transcriptional activators. This conclusion was further supported by the ß-galactosidase activity assay, in which blue staining indicates the activation of another reporter gene LacZ. In contrast, yeast cells transformed with BnaMYB3, -4, -7, -32, -38, -44, -56, -73, -77 and -91 plasmids did not show any growth on the selective medium, suggesting that they are transcriptional repressors (Fig. 2). In addition, the pink to red colour of colonies transformed with putative transcriptional repressor plasmids also indicated that ADE2 reporter gene was not expressed. Analysis of transactivational activity of BnaMYB in budding yeast. The yeast cells of strain AH109 harbouring the indicated plasmid were grown on either the non-selective (SD-LW) or selective (SD-LWHA) media, followed by ß-galactosidase assay (X-Gal staining). Decreasing cell densities in the dilution series are illustrated by narrowing triangles.

BD at the last row represents empty pGBKT7 vector.Previous reports have identified two groups of repression motif in plant TF.23,24 The first group is the ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, which is a small yet distinct regulatory motif that is conserved in many plant TF associated with diverse biological functions. A genome-wide analysis enabled refining EAR motifs as comprising either LxLxL or DLNxxP (where x represents any amino acid).25 We found that protein sequences of BnaMYB3, -4, -7, -32, -44, -73, -77 and -91 have such an LxLxL motif (Supplementary Fig. S1). The second group of repression motif was firstly identified in B3 family TF in Arabidopsis and has conserved R/KLFGV motif.24 However, a thorough examination of all our BnaMYBs indicates that this second group of repression motif does not exist in any of the BnaMYBs reported here. In addition, neither BnaMYB38 nor BnaMYB56 has any of the two groups of reported repressor motifs, indicative of novel unidentified repression motif. This phenomenon was also observed with a few WRKY and NAC TF from canola and Arabidopsis, which showed transcriptional repression activity both in yeast and in protoplast assays (manuscript in preparation).We further examined the repression function of representative BnaMYB TFs using the Arabidopsis protoplast assay system. Firefly luciferase (fLUC) gene driven by CaMV 35S promoter with five copies of GAL4-binding element in front of TATA box was used as reporter, and Renilla luciferase (rLUC) gene driven by 35S promoter was used as the internal control. Viral protein (VP) 16 transcriptional activation domain was used as a positive control (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The results showed that VP16 had higher relative luciferase activity compared with control GAL4-BD as expected (Supplementary Fig. S3B). However, expression of BnaMYB4, -32, -77 and -91 caused significant lower luciferase activity compared with the vector control GAL4-BD (Supplementary Fig. S3B).These results indicate that these BnaMYB TFs can function as repressors in Arabidopsis protoplast assay system, consistent with the results obtained in the yeast assay system. In contrast, we also tested the transcriptional activity of BnaMYB78 in Arabidopsis protoplasts, and the result showed that it had higher relative luciferase activity compared with control GAL4-BD (Supplementary Fig. S3C). However, compared with the positive control VP16, BnaMYB78 showed lower relative luciferase activity, indicating that BnaMYB78 is a transcriptional activator, but not as strong as the well-known transcriptional activator VP16.3.4. Expression analysis of BnaMYB genes in response to abiotic stress and hormone treatmentsTo elucidate the functions of BnaMYB genes in the context of abiotic and hormone stimuli, the expression patterns of 15 selected BnaMYB genes, representing 10 subgroups in the phylogenetic tree, were studied in response to a variety of stress conditions including ABA, Paraquat (methyl viologen, MV), salinity, cold, heat and drought, using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT–PCR). Data of three independent biological replicates were analysed to identify BnaMYB genes responsive to one or a combination of stress conditions (Fig. 3). The results showed that ABA induced expression of BnaMYB44 and -73, while down-regulated that of BnaMYB3, -12 and -16 at either 6 h or 24 h or both time points. MV treatment up-regulated the transcript abundance of BnaMYB3, while down-regulating BnaMYB12, -13, -32 and -95. Salt stress induced transcript accumulation of BnaMYB16, -44 and -90, whereas it repressed BnaMYB61 transcription at either the early or late time point. Cold stress induced the transcript accumulation of BnaMYB3, -44 and -108, while down-regulating that of BnaMYB12 and -16. Heat stress induced the expression of BnaMYB3, -12 and -56 at the 24 h time point; however, it repressed BnaMYB13 and -95 expression 6 h after treatment. Lastly, drought stress induced BnaMYB95 expression at both time points but repressed BnaMYB108 expression at the 6 h time point. It is also noted that BnaMYB3 was induced by both cold and heat stresses, suggesting its potential role in signal transduction under extreme temperatures. The co-induction of plant genes by opposite stress conditions, for instance, cold and heat, has been reported in both Arabidopsis and crop plants.26–28 Taken together, these data indicate that on one hand, some BnaMYB genes participate in transduction of multiple stresses; and on the other hand, a specific stress activates transcription of more than one BnaMYB, providing evidence that BnaMYBs play a role in the cross-talk of multiple stresses, including both abiotic stresses and ABA signalling.

Subcellular localization of canola R2R3-MYB proteinsTo investigate the subcellular localization of canola MYB proteins, selected genes were fused in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene and expressed in leaves of N. benthamiana, with the GFP signal observed 2 days later. We found that in leaf cells expressing the fusion proteins of BnaMYB16, -34, -38, -62, -73, -77, -78 and -108, the GFP signals were present only in the nucleus (Fig. 4), which is in agreement with their role of TF. As a control, we also examined the subcellular localization of the GFP protein in leaf cells, and green signals were present obviously both in cytosol and in nuclei (Fig. 4). Besides, we used two different programs, NucPrep and PredictNLS, to predict the putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of all the canola R2R3-MYB TFs and found that except BnaMYB62, all other BnaMYBs have NLS in their amino acid sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Expression of BnaMYB78 gene promoted ROS accumulation and hypersensitive response-like cell deathIn the aforementioned GFP subcellular assay using N. benthamiana, we observed that expression of BnaMYB78 in leaves led to hypersensitive response (HR) symptoms within 2 days after infiltration. HR is a common feature of plant immune responses and a type of programmed cell death (PCD). Activation of cell death is one of the aspects of plant defence responses where ROS play a crucial role.29 Sequence analysis indicates that BnaMYB78 and AtMYB78(At5g49620) show an identity of 74.1and 64.3% at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. A literature search demonstrated that function of MYB78 gene in ROS and cell death has not been investigated yet, even in the model plant Arabidopsis. To further explore the role of BnaMYB78 gene in inducing ROS accumulation and cell death, we constructed the coding region of it into another binary vector pYJHA under the driving of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Then we performed agroinfiltration of target gene plasmid and GFP control plasmid individually into N. benthamiana leaves and evaluated the phenotype daily for a total of 7 days. Interestingly, expression of BnaMYB78 indeed caused pathogen-independent cell death compared with GFP vector control, beginning 2 days post-infiltration (dpi) and proceeded as expected (Fig. 5A). To explore the role of ROS during cell death, we performed DAB staining and the results showed that there was staining in sites expressing BnaMYB78 beginning at 2 dpi, and this staining was enhanced as time went by. However, insignificant or very weak staining was detected in sites expressing the GFP gene alone (Fig. 5A). To further confirm the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), we measured the content of it using an improved method to more accurately reflect H2O2 concentration. Indeed, significantly higher content of H2O2 was accumulated in leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78 than that of GFP at the three time points examined (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we examined the electrolyte leakage of leaf discs taken from leaves expressing BnaMYB78 and GFP. The results showed that a significant increase (2.5-folds) in ion leakage was visible 4 days after agroinfiltration of BnaMYB78 in contrast to that of leaves expressing the GFP gene alone (Fig. 6C).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We then examined the concentration of chlorophyll and anthocyanins in leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78 or GFP. The results showed that in leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78, the concentration of chlorophyll decreased significantly compared with GFP control at the three time points (Fig. 6D). In addition, this decrease in total chlorophyll in leaf tissues expressing BnaMYB78 proceeded as the symptoms developed more seriously, although a slight decrease in the control leaf tissues was also observed, possibly as result of agrobacterium infiltration. Anthocyanins are important antioxidants that can help protect plants from damage by ROS.30 Anthocyanins are present in a wide range of plant species and are responsible for the purple colouration of plant parts. We also quantified the anthocyanin concentration in different leaf tissues and the results showed that expressing BnaMYB78 significantly increased anthocyanin accumulation (Fig. 6E).As intracellular ROS accumulation usually causes lipid peroxidation, which damages cell membranes and therefore the cells, we monitored the content of MDA formed by the decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids as a result of attack from ROS. The data showed that in leaf discs expression BnaMYB78, the MDA concentration was significantly higher than that in the GFP control at 4, 5, 6 and 7 dpi (Fig. 6F). This further indicates that the aforementioned cell death is associated with ROS-induced cell membrane breakage.Since chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation occur in naturally senescent tissues or during cell death, we further examined the change in nuclear DNA in leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78 or GFP using the TUNEL assay. For this assay, a bacterial source GUS gene was used as the control, because the excitation wavelength (488 nm) of GFP and fluorescein (FITC) overlaps and so GFP interferes with TUNEL assay (data not shown). We also confirmed that expression of GUS, like GFP, did not cause any symptom of HR-like cell death (data not shown). Not surprisingly, leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78 exhibited strong fluorescent signals of fluorescein in the epidermal nuclei based on confocal microscopy, suggesting single- or double-stranded DNA breaks in the nuclei (Fig. 6A). As expected, the signal was not detectable in control leaf cells expressing GUS gene (Fig. 6B). Overall, the above assays support that BnaMYB78 expression led to evident ROS accumulation and cell death in leaf tissues.Previous studies have shown that in Arabidopsis, MYB30 is a positive regulator of pathogen-induced PCD and has an important role in disease resistance.31,32 Silencing of AtMYB30 strongly inhibits HR-like cell death in response to avirulent pathogens, which corresponds with decreased defence gene expression and decreased resistance to virulent pathogens. Further, targets of MYB30 are genes from the acyl-CoA elongase complex and the action of MYB30 seems to modulate very-long-chain fatty acid content.33 As AtMYB30 belongs to Subgroup 1 while BnaMYB78 Subgroup 20, this means MYB78 is a novel TF modulating hypersensitive-like cell death.3.7. BnaMYB78 modulates ROS- and defence-related gene transcriptionPrevious reports have demonstrated that ROS play dual roles in plants. On one hand, being toxic molecules, they are capable of injuring cells. On the other hand, they control many different processes such as growth, development and stress adaptation in plants.34 Therefore, it is clear that the steady-state level of ROS in cells needs to be tightly regulated. In the model plant Arabidopsis, a network of at least 152 genes, encoding ROS-scavenging and ROS-producing proteins, is involved in managing the level of ROS.34 ROS can be generated by various enzymatic activities, of which the best studied are NADPH oxidases (NOX). In plants, NOX homologues are also called respiratory burst oxidase homologues (Rbohs), which are associated with plasma membrane and constitute a small gene family and play versatile roles in plant growth, development and stress responses.35 ROS could also be removed by an array of ROS-scavenging enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). However, how these enzymes implicated in ROS homeostasis are transcriptionally regulated in plant cells is largely unknown.To determine how BnaMYB78 regulates ROS level in plant cells, we used qRT–PCR to examine the expression of an array of downstream marker genes, which are reported to regulate ROS production and scavenging in Arabidopsis and tobacco.34 A previous study has demonstrated that NbRbohA and NbRbohB, homologues of AtRbohD and AtRbohF, mediate H2O2 accumulation.36 qRT–PCR assays of three biological replicates showed that the transcript level of NbRbohB was ~6-fold higher in leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78 than that in the GFP control, whereas NbRbohA did not show significant change (Fig. 7A). qRT–PCR analysis of changes at the transcript level of ROS- and defence-related marker genes. Real-time quantitative RT–PCR analyses were performed to determine transcript levels of marker genes in control and BnaMYB78 leaves at 3 and 5 dpi. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three biological replicates. The PP2A, L23 and F-box mRNA levels were used as the endogenous control.

Asterisks denote significant differences (compared with 1) by Student's t-test analysis (*P = 0.05).Next, the transcript levels of plant-specific genes encoding vacuolar processing enzymes (VPE) functioning as executors of cell death37 were also investigated. Besides, two metacaspase genes MC4 (MCP2d) and MC8 (MCP2e), which encode cysteine proteases structurally related to animal caspases, were also included in our analysis. In Arabidopsis, MC4 is the predominant and constitutively expressed member of type II metacaspases and plays a positive regulatory role in biotic and abiotic stress-induced PCD,38,39 while MC8 modulates PCD induced by ultraviolet light and H2O2.40 Our data demonstrated that although transcript levels of MC4, MC8 and VPE3 genes were increased at 3 dpi, the changes are not significant (Fig. 7A).Thirdly, we examined the transcript changes of a variety of genes encoding antioxidant metabolic enzymes, such as APX, CAT, GPX, GST and SOD as well as alternative oxidase (AOX) lowering mitochondrial ROS production in plant cells.41 The results demonstrated that transcript levels of NbtAPX, NbCAT3 and NbGST were most prominently increased with an average of 3- to over 10-folds higher in leaf discs expressing BnaMYB78 compared with the GFP control, at one or two time points (Fig. 7A and B). The transcription of NbAPX1, NbCAT1, NbGPX2 and NbSOD was also up-regulated, though the values were not very significant.Fourthly, expression of a subset of marker genes of leaf senescence and ROS-induced cell death was also monitored. These include homologues of Arabidopsis senescence-associated gene (SAG) 12, SAG101 and ZAT12.42 We found that expression of these three genes showed only slight increase as a result of BnaMYB78 expression at one or two time points tested (Fig. 7B).Since accumulation of ROS is involved in plant defence response and HR-like cell death is a common feature of defence response,43 we further examined the expression of a set of genes implicated in plant defence response and marker genes of HR-like cell death. Three marker genes that are rapidly and transiently up-regulated upon pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) treatment in N. benthamiana, namely NbACRE31, NbACRE132 and NbCYP71D20,44 were examined. qRT–PCR data showed that transcript abundance of NbACRE31 and NbCYP71D20 was significantly induced by BnaMYB78 expression at 3 dpi, with an average of 10.4- and 3.2-folds, respectively (Fig. 7B). Lastly, four marker genes, including cysteine protease (CP)23, hairpin inducing (HIN)1, pathogenesis-related (PR)2 and PR5, which are all highly induced during HR-like cell death,45 were analysed. The results showed that NbCP23, NbHIN1, NbPR2 and NbPR5 genes were all transcriptionally induced in BnaMYB78-expressing leaf discs at one or two time points (Fig. 7B).The next question is whether transcriptional activator BnaMYB78 could directly positively regulate the transcription of the above marker genes that showed significant changes. For this end, we used the dual LUC assay system. We firstly used PCR to clone the ca. 1 kb upstream regions (relative to the translational start codon ATG, containing promoter and 5'UTR) of a few up-regulated genes using high-fidelity polymerase and fused before the fLUC genes. Then, the different combinations of reporter vectors and an effector vector pYJHA-BnaMYB78 were individually co-infiltrated into the leaf epidermis of N. benthamiana, with pCsGFPBT used as the control. The rLUC driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter was included to monitor transformation efficiency and normalize these data.15 To better monitor the transcriptional regulation, the two time points (3 and 5 dpi) for the above qRT–PCR assay were included in this assay. The results demonstrated that expression of the BnaMYB78 could slightly increase PNbRbohB-driving fLUC gene expression 4.5-folds at 5 dpi, compared with the GFP control (Fig. 8A). Similarly, the ability of upstream region of NbGST to activate fLUC expression was increased by BnaMYB78 to 2.2- and 12.2-folds at the 3 and 5 dpi, respectively (Fig. 8B). Besides, co-expression of BnaMYB78 and PNbHIN1-driving fLUC caused a 6.2- and 4.8-fold increase in fLUC activity at 3 and 5 dpi, respectively (Fig. 8C).

Similarly, we performed a dual LUC assay and the results showed that BnaMYB78 did up-regulate the expression of fLUC driven by promoters of both BnaGST and BnaHIN1, compared with the GFP control (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, expression of BnaMYB78 down-regulated expression of PBnaRbohA- and PBnaRbohB-driving fLUC at both 3 and 5 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S4). The slight difference between orthologous pairs has been reported previously.12 Whether there are other canola MYB genes mediating cell death or ROS signalling awaits to be investigated further.4. ConclusionMYB TFs are very important in plant development, abiotic stress and defence responses. So far, function of only a small number MYB genes in Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and tomato has been reported.1,2 In the present study, we described the identification, cloning and analysis of R2R3-MYB genes in the important oilseed crop, canola, through mining of EST databases. We successfully identified 76 R2R3-MYB genes from canola and cloned the cDNA sequences of 44 R2R3-MYB genes (Table 1). An analysis of the phylogenetic relationship of R2R3-MYB proteins from representative plant species indicated an evident increasing numbers of R2R3-MYB genes from lower to higher plants. This also suggests that different types of duplications of R2R3-MYB genes may occur during the evolutionary history. Further, we studied the transcriptional activity of 36 BnaMYB TFs in yeast and found that 26 of them may function as transcriptional activators in cells while the other 10 BnaMYBs may act as transcriptional repressors (Fig. 2). The responses of 15 BnaMYB genes under abiotic stress and hormone treatments were analysed through qRT–PCR, and we found that 12 BnaMYB genes could be significantly regulated by at least one treatment, suggesting MYB TFs may participate in the cross-talk of different signalling pathways under stress conditions. More importantly, we identified expression of a novel MYB, BnaMYB78, led to cell death in leaves of N. benthamiana, which is dependent on ROS accumulation (Fig. 5). A further investigation of transcription of ROS- and defence-related marker genes supported that BnaMYB78 might exert its function through modulating the expression of a few ROS- and defence-related genes including RbohB, GST and HIN1. A bioinformatic analysis and literature search indicated that MYB78 is a novel cell death-mediating member of MYB TF family. Overall, this study of R2R3-MYB genes in canola has laid a solid foundation for further exploration of their roles in abiotic stress and ABA signalling.

Introduction`The genus Quercus is a major forest tree genus with 300–600 species spread throughout the world (http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/orders/fagalesweb.htm#Fagales). The European white oak species complex—including Quercus robur (Qr), pedunculate oak and Quercus petraea (Qp), sessile oak, in particular—is an exceptional model for studies of the genetics of speciation in sympatry.1–4 These two main oak species have similar distribution areas, but display morphological differences for many traits, including leaf shape, acorn peduncle length, and hairiness.5 They also have different ecophysiological requirements: Qr tolerates waterlogging and light exposure more effectively than Qp,6 whereas Qp has a higher water use efficiency and is more shade-tolerant, consistent with its role as a post-pioneer species.7–9 These two sympatric species are interfertile, forming natural hybrids in mixed stands and displaying only partial reproductive isolation (RI).3,10Low-density genetic linkage maps in oaks have been constructed with various genotyping techniques: random amplified polmorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat (SSR).11–13 Progress has recently been made, with the development of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay for Qr and Qp.14 Using this resource, we were able in this present study to construct high-density gene-based maps with a large number of SNP markers, providing a detailed scan of segregation distortion (SD) within the genome. SD, corresponding to deviation from the expected Mendelian proportion of individuals in a given genotypic class within a segregating population, has been widely documented in plant species, within the framework of genetic mapping studies, e.g. in barley,15 clementine,16 eucalyptus,17 maize,18 rice,19 monkeyflower,20 poplar21 and tomato.22 The detection of SD depends heavily on the type of cross. In most cases, SD is stronger and, therefore, easier to detect, in interspecific crosses than in intraspecific crosses.23 Some of these studies showed that distortion spreads over linked markers (and even over large genetic distances in some cases), creating SD regions (SDR). SD may result from three underlying causes. Gametic incompatibility (one of the many types of prezygotic barrier)24 and/or reduced hybrid viability (one of the many forms of post-zygotic selection)25,26 may be involved. Indeed, various developmental processes in the pollen, embryo and seedling offer opportunities for differential selection at the gamete (pollen tube competition, pollen tube growth) and/or zygote (embryo competition, ovule abortion) level. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is an alternative mechanism that may give rise to SD. Genetic load has often been advocated as a source of SD, particularly in trees, which form large populations likely to have accumulated large number of deleterious mutations.27,28 SD may also arise due to asymmetric allelic inheritance in heterozygotes (i.e. meiotic drive),29 but this process is not considered here as it relates to hybrid fertility rather than hybrid viability.In this context, the first objective of this study was to establish a high-density gene-based genetic map of oak by genotyping more than 1,000 full-sibs from two intraspecific and two interspecific full-sib families of Q. petraea and Q. robur. A single composite map was constructed by merging the eight parental maps. This map includes 4,261 gene-based markers and is the densest linkage map ever produced for oak. The second objective of our study was to carry out a detailed analysis of the SDRs based on the patterns of SD observed for intraspecific and interspecific crosses. The SDRs identified on the eight linkage maps were compared to investigate the causes of the observed SDRs that span 6 of the 12 chromosomes. More precisely, we describe the extent of SD along linkage groups (LGs) and depict the distribution of SDRs, compare the consistency of SDRs across different genetic backgrounds and draw inferences about the potential sources of the widespread SD in the oak genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and DNA extractionSix parental trees, three Q. robur (3P, A4, 11P) and three Q. petraea (QS28, QS21, QS29), were used to generate four full-sib families (F1) (Fig. 1): One Q. robur intraspecific family (3P × A4) referred to as P1.One Q. petraea intraspecific family (QS28f × QS21) referred to as P4.Two interspecific families (11P1 × QS28m, 11P2 × QS29) referred to as P2 and P3.Description of the four pedigrees (3P, A4, 11P, QS28, QS29 and QS21 referred to the name of the parents used for the controlled crosses. P1, P2, P3 and P4 correspond to the name of the pedigree; n represents the number of offspring in each pedigree).Description of the four pedigrees (3P, A4, 11P, QS28, QS29 and QS21 referred to the name of the parents used for the controlled crosses. P1, P2, P3 and P4 correspond to the name of the pedigree; n represents the number of offspring in each pedigree).Crosses are denoted ‘female parent × male parent’ below. The same parental tree of Q. petraea (QS28) was used as the male parent in one cross (QS28m) and the female parent (QS28f) in another cross. Furthermore, the Q. robur parent 11P was used as a female parent in two different crosses and is therefore named 11P1 and 11P2.Quercus robur had to be used as the female parent in all interspecific crosses, due to the strong asymmetry of hybridization success3,30 between these two species. The sizes of the progenies of the full-sib crosses varied from 398 (QS28f × QS21) to 114 (11P2 × QS29) individuals. Intraspecific and interspecific controlled crosses were implemented over the years since 1993. The offspring were installed in stool beds at the nursery of the INRA Forestry Research Station Pierroton (latitude 44.44°N, longitude 0.46°W) in South West of France, before subsequent vegetative propagation of the offspring. Bud and leaf material was collected on the stool beds and DNA was extracted as described by Bodénès et al.132.2. SNP genotypingSNP genotyping was carried out on the four mapping populations (1,059 samples in total), with the Illumina® Infinium iSelect Custom Genotyping Array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's standard protocol, using 200 ng of genomic DNA per sample. The selected SNPs correspond to two different data sets, the first one was obtained from the resequencing of six trees used as parents of the four controlled crosses and the second one was obtained from the oak Unigene established by Ueno et al.31 In total, 7,913 SNPs were selected for array design. We deliberately selected a limited number of markers (from 1 to 3) per contig, to ensure a broad distribution of SNPs across the genome.142.3. Linkage map constructionFor each cross, two data sets were generated, each containing the meiotic segregation information from one of the parents. Markers segregating in a 1:1 ratio (testcross configuration) were mapped with JoinMap 4.0 (Kyazma, Wageningen, NL).32 For each population, the minimum logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold for grouping was determined by identifying grouping tree branches with stable marker numbers over increasing consecutive LOD values for a total number of groups of 12 which corresponds to the number of chromosome. The minimum LOD threshold for most of the linkage maps was 5 and increased to 6 for P4m map or 7 for P2m map. The two parental linkage maps for each mapping population were constructed with the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, with a minimum LOD of 5 and the default parameters (recombination frequency of 0.4 and a maximum threshold value of 1 for the jump). Recombination frequencies were converted to map distances in cM with the Kosambi's mapping function. The maps shown were plotted with MapChart 2.033 or using an R script. LG numbering was based on SSR markers, as in the study by Bodénès et al.13 The cosegregation of SSRs and SNPs (data not shown) made it possible to identify homologous LGs unambiguously.2.4. Composite map constructionWe constructed a composite map from the eight parental maps, with the LPmerge software developed by Endelman and Plomion,34 which is available as an R package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LPmerge/index.html. This approach is based on the integration of linkage map data rather than observed recombination between markers, with linear programming used to minimize the mean absolute error between the composite map and the linkage map for each population as efficiently as possible. For assessment of the goodness-of-fit for the composite map, LPmerge computes a root-mean-square error (RMSE) per LG by comparing the position (in cM) of all markers on the composite map with that on the component maps (http://w3.pierroton.inra.fr/cgi-bin/cmap/viewer?ref_map_set_acc=51&ref_map_accs=-1). We calculated this metric for different maximum interval sizes (k in the algorithm), ranging from 1 to 8. The value of k minimizing the mean RMSE per LG was selected for construction of the composite map (Supplementary File S1). Intercross markers (segregating in a 1:2:1 ratio) were added as accessory markers in a second step taking the rate of recombination between these loci and the closest linked test-cross framework marker (FM) into account.2.5. SD analysisWe tested each marker for significant deviation from the expected Mendelian genotype frequencies (<U+03C7>2 with 1 degree of freedom for codominant markers, a= 0.05 calculated with JoinMap software) to detect SD. Assuming that each LG corresponds to one chromosome (n= 12 in Quercus) and that each chromosome contains at least two independent regions (the mean length of LGs was 66 cM, this paper), we expected there to be at least 24 independent genomic regions. A threshold of at least 0.05/24 ˜ 0.002 would therefore be required to obtain a genome wide error rate of a = 0.05. However, we applied a more stringent threshold (a = 0.001) and only considered distorted regions with more than three tightly linked distorted loci, to decrease the false-positive rate and to ensure that only biologically meaningful SDRs were detected. Markers displaying SD were conserved and integrated into the map. We investigated the patterns of distortion on the eight parental maps, by plotting the <U+03C7>2 value of each marker along the 12 LG of the composite map obtained with the LPmerge programme (Fig. 2). Distribution of SD for the 12 LGs for the 8 parental maps, a = 0.001. The vertical line corresponds to a type I error of 0.001. The x-axis corresponds to the <U+03C7>2 value and the y-axis corresponds to the map length of the LG in cM.

Results3.1. SNP genotypingThe 7,913 SNPs were submitted to Illumina for Oligo Pool All (OPA) design for use in the Infinium assay. From the initial set of 7,913 SNPs, 903 (11.4%) did not pass Illumina production quality control and were eliminated. The genotyping data, across the four mapping populations, for the 7,010 SNPs retained were analyzed with Illumina GenomeStudio software, which clusters and calls data automatically, making it possible to visualize the data directly.14 For each SNP, the representation of the genotyping data included three main clusters, corresponding to the AA homozygote, the AB heterozygote and the BB homozygote. We obtained four different segregating configurations in the F1 mapping populations: AB×AA (heterozygous in the female parent), AA×AB (heterozygous in the male parent) (Fig. 3a), AB×AB (both parents heterozygous) (Fig. 3b) and AA×AA, BB×BB or AA×BB (both parents homozygous, not informative for genetic mapping). We inspected all the SNPs by eye on the Illumina clusters, making use of the distribution of the segregating full-sibs relative to the parental positions. Observations were carried out individually for each mapping pedigree. The results for the four mapping populations were merged, and 5,726 SNPs were retained (Table 1). We discarded SNPs that did not yield well defined, clearly separated clusters (i.e. for which the genotype could not be called unambiguously). We optimized the positions of the segregating loci, by mapping as FMs only the SNPs segregating in a testcross configuration (1:1 ratio). Intercross markers (1:2:1 ratio) are less informative for linkage analysis.35 They were therefore excluded from construction of the framework map.

Construction of eight parental maps and one composite mapFrom the 7,010 SNPs passing Illumina production quality control testing, 6,363 SNPs were ‘scorable’ and were used to genotype the four mapping populations.14 The number of SNPs mapped differed between parental trees, ranging from 1,421 SNPs for P3f to 889 for P4m (Table 2). The 12 expected LGs were retrieved for all the parental trees. The size of the genetic maps varied from 684 cM (P4f) to 840 cM (P4m) (Supplementary File S2). The number of markers per LG varied from 259 (LG2 for P4f) to 40 (LG4 for P1m) (Supplementary File S2). The LGs were all of similar size (mean of 62 ± 11 cM, suggesting the presence of at least one chiasma per chromosome), except for LG2, which was ~1.5 times longer than the other LGs. Alignment of the eight parental maps obtained for the two species (Q. robur and Q. petraea) revealed a high degree of collinearity between the maps, making it possible to construct a composite map with LPmerge software composed of 4,261 FMs and 129 accessory markers (provided by intercross markers). We noticed that markers at the end of some LGs (LG3, LG4, LG5, LG7, LG8 and LG11) were around 5–14 cM distant from adjacent markers (Supplementary File S3). These markers were found to be present in only one (LG3, LG4, LG7, LG8) or two (for LG5 and LG11) contributing maps and distorted the merged map distances calculated by LPmerge. Therefore, these markers were moved at the position of their nearest adjacent marker calculated by JoinMap on the parental map. This URL allows us to compare LGs from different parental linkage maps: http://w3.pierroton.inra.fr/cgi-bin/cmap/map_details?ref_pmap_set_acc=47;ref_map_accs=1251;comparative_maps=1%3dmap_acc%3d1287;highlight=%22s_1BHPHQ_1326%22. The 12 composite LGs constructed from testcross markers covered 742 cM in total, with individual LG lengths of 51 cM (LG1) to 93 cM (LG2) and a mean density of 1 SNP marker per 0.2 cM (Table 3, Fig. 4).

Segregation distortionThe genome-wide patterns of SD for the eight parental maps are presented in Fig. 2. Overall, 0 (P2f, P3f) to 15% (P2m) of SNPs, depending on the mapping population and the parental tree, displayed significant SD (a = 0.001) (Table 4). SD was non-randomly distributed along LGs: nine SDRs were identified on the eight parental maps. These SDRs were unevenly distributed on six LGs. Three types of SDR were observed: (i) SDRs at the ends of LGs (LG2, LG6, LG10), (ii) SDRs in the middle of the LG (LG4, LG8) and (iii) SDRs encompassing the whole LG (LG11) (Figs 2 and 4). The most significant distortions were observed on LG8 (P2m, 96% of markers displayed SD), LG11 (P2m and P3m, 60–88% of loci displaying SD, respectively), LG4 (P2m, 44% of loci displaying SD), LG6 (P1f, P4f and P4m, 20 to 32% of loci displaying SD) and LG10 (P1m, 40% of loci displaying SD) (Table 5). We found that 79% of the 359 loci displaying SD belonged to the male parent (<U+03C7>² test, P-value of 9 × 10-5) and 62% belonged to the two interspecific crosses (<U+03C7>² test, P-value of 1 × 10-3).

Discussion4.1. Construction of a high-density gene-based linkage map and application in genetic studies in oak and beyondWe report here the development and validation of the first high-throughput Illumina SNP genotyping assay for oaks, with a success rate of 88.6%, i.e. 7,010 of the 7,913 SNPs were successfully genotyped. Overall, 82% of the SNPs successfully genotyped were polymorphic in at least one of the four pedigrees and 63% were mapped as FMs on the parental genetic maps.The use of multiple segregating populations of diverse genetic backgrounds made it possible to map a larger number of markers and to achieve greater genome coverage. This has already been illustrated in watermelon, for example, in which the genotyping of four mapping populations increased the proportion of mapped loci from the most polymorphic pedigree by 29%.36 In this study, the gain in terms of the number of newly segregating test-cross markers from the pedigree with the largest number of SNPs (2,472 in P2) with respect to the other three pedigrees was remarkably high, reaching +1,756 SNPs (i.e. +41% newly mapped markers).The development of array-based genotyping technologies has made it possible to generate high-density linkage maps rapidly, but the integration of independent maps containing thousands of loci remains a real challenge.37–39 Two main approaches have been developed for the construction of combined maps. The first involves pooling genotypic data and minimizing the sum of recombination frequencies, as proposed in the ML method implemented in JoinMap (e.g. as used in triticale by Alheit et al.37 and in sunflower by Bowers et al.).38 However, this method is time-consuming and may be not appropriate when thousands of markers are used, due to the computational time required. The second approach involves the direct integration of independent linkage maps, as proposed in MergeMap40,41 and LPmerge34 and recently used in pine,39,42 barley43 and wheat.44 Using this second approach, we merged eight linkage maps each containing 889–1,421 markers, to obtain a composite map including 4,261 loci corresponding to 4,239 different contigs of the oak UniGene database45 and covering 742 cM on the 12 LGs. This map is considerably denser than a previously published linkage map based on 397 EST and genomic SSRs.13Framework maps were constructed exclusively from markers with a testcross configuration. All intercross markers were excluded from construction of the framework map because they provide little information about linkage.35 We added markers segregating in the intercross configuration at a later stage, as accessory markers. The eight parental maps displayed remarkably high degrees of collinearity and no chromosomal rearrangements were observed, providing support for our approach of merging maps to construct a unified composite map for the genus Quercus, including both species maps. In the framework of the oak genome sequencing project,46 this genomic resource will be crucial for the assembly of genome scaffolds into chromosomal pseudomolecules. High-density sequence-based linkage maps have been used to anchor and orient scaffolds in many plant species, including Cicer arietinum (chickpea),47Rubus (raspberry)48 and Eucalyptus.49 The oak composite linkage map also provides a framework for genome-wide analysis at the centimorgan scale, for genomic scans of species/population divergence,50 studies of the evolutionary relationships between related species,16,51 the detection of recombination hot and cold spots,52 studies of the extent of long-distance linkage disequilibrium and genetic diversity,39,53 the detection and positional characterization of QTLs through co-localization with gene-based markers (e.g.54–56), and the identification of chromosomal rearrangements.57 This unified linkage map for the genus Quercus will also be useful for analyses of synteny and collinearity within the Fagaceae at a much higher resolution than previously reported (e.g. between Quercus and Castanea),13,14,58 and for extending such analyses to other Eurosids, providing insight into genome evolution59 and a framework for the transfer of genetic information between species.4.2. Patterns of SD identify gametic incompatibility as a major RI barrier in oakDeviation from the ratios expected for Mendelian inheritance reveal disturbances in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, generating interesting hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying RI for exploration in further studies. Overall, our results revealed that SD was widespread in the oak genome. Regardless of the species or cross, half of the 12 LGs displayed SD, for 6–91% of markers, depending on the LG. We observed large differences in SD values between intra- and interspecific crosses, and between male and female parents.These SDRs may result from chromosome loss or rearrangements, genetic load or pre- or post-zygotic selection, and interpretation may differ between intra- and interspecific crosses.Peculiar life history traits of trees may raise their genetic load and result in substantial SD. Oaks, like most forest trees species, form very large populations, and generally outcross through wind pollination, resulting in high levels of gene flow.60,61 These characteristics lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and the build-up of a large genetic load.27 The accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations in fitness genes (pollen fertility, anther receptivity, seed fertility) or loci closely linked to fitness genes decreases the viability of plants with homozygous at these loci.62 Genetic load may be partially purged at early embryonic stages, by the death or sterility of hybrids carrying homozygous recessive deleterious mutations. Genetic load varies considerably between plant species and may be a major source of SDRs.17 For the intraspecific pedigree P4, we observed SDRs on LG6 that were conserved between the two parental maps. This could indicate the presence of lethal or sublethal genes compromising seedling survival in both parental genotypes.48Gametic incompatibility and/or reduced hybrid viability can also contribute to SD. In this study, the proportion of loci displaying SD differed between the eight linkage maps (0–14.5%). The frequency of SD was higher on three LGs: LG6 (28% of loci displaying SD distributed over 16 cM, for three parents), LG 8 (26.5%, 55 cM, one parent) and LG11 (26.5%, 33 cM, two parents). In several previous studies (eucalyptus,63 rice19 and monkeyflower),20 clusters of distorted loci were found to extend over all or most of the LG. In rice, for example, distortion gradually decreases with increasing distance from the markers displaying the highest levels of SD, located at or near previously reported gametophytic gene loci or sterility loci. In our study, 79% of the loci presenting SD were of paternal origin whatever the type of cross (intra- or inter-specific). LG11 in the cross with QS29 as the male parent (P3m) provides an extreme example, with an SDR encompassing 88% of the SNPs on this LG, as previously reported in a study with far fewer EST–SSR markers and a much smaller number of offspring.13 These figures may reflect strong pollen incompatibilities between the parents of the different crosses, as previously reported by Abadie et al.64 Indeed, the results obtained for one genotype (QS28), used as either the male or the female parent in controlled crosses, strongly support the observed trend: the number of markers displaying SD was five times higher when this genotype was used as the male parent (P2m) than when it was used as the female parent (P4f). A confounding effect of the type of cross may also have contributed to the observed pattern (see next paragraph) because QS28 was used as the male in the interspecific cross and as the female in the intraspecific cross. Male gametophytic selection has been identified as the phenomenon most frequently causing skewed segregation, due to selective influences of the gynoecium, resulting in genetic incompatibility.19Interestingly, 62% of the loci displaying SD were derived from interspecific crosses and were only detected in the male LGs. SD is frequently observed in interspecific crosses, and has been attributed to biological factors, such as pollen–pistil incompatibility, hybrid viability, sterility due to gametophytic competition, negative epistatic interactions between alleles or positive introgression.17,21 Pre-reproductive barriers play a major role in the directionality of introgression: genetically based pollen discrimination is a major barrier, as it greatly increases assortative mating within species and the parental species fidelity of hybrids.65 Alternatively, natural selection may play a key role by acting against unfit genetic combinations. Lepais and Gerber66 observed lower levels of mating success for interspecific crosses compared with intraspecific crosses or backcross mating events, in a mixed stand of four European white oak species (including Qr and Qp). They clearly showed that the different species contributed unequally to reproduction success through differences in pollen efficacy. Most pure-bred plants reproduce preferentially with conspecific individuals. These findings were confirmed by another independent hybridization study conducted in a mixed stand of four European white oak species, Qr, Qp, Quercus pubescens and Quercus frainetto.1 This previous study highlighted the importance of selection against hybrids, resulting in the maintenance of four distinct parental gene pools in sympatry. Based on these observations, we suggest that gametic incompatibility could lead to SD in chromosomal regions on either the female or the male map, whereas reduced hybrid variability would be likely to cause SD in the corresponding regions of both parental maps. Most of the observed SDRs were identified in only one parent, generally the male. Thus, a large fraction of the SDRs were sex-specific, suggesting that gametic selection plays an important role in shaping SDRs in oak.5. ConclusionOur study demonstrates the relevance of Illumina technology for SNP genotyping for multipedigree studies in oaks. The high rate of successful SNP development for the six different parental genotypes used in the four controlled crosses provided us with a very large set of mappable SNPs, which was essential for comparative mapping and construction of the oak high-density composite linkage map.We established a high-density composite linkage map based on more than 4,261 SNP loci suitable for use as a reference gene-based map for the genus Quercus and for the Fagaceae in general. Genomic resources are available for very few species within the Fagaceae family and the map developed here could be useful for studies of species from the same genus or for related genera belonging to this family.Finally, we identified regions of SD potentially related to RI or genetic load. Further studies assessing seed abortion and the viability of young hybrid seedlings during juvenile development are required to shed light on the causal mechanisms underlying RI. Additional investigations of the co-localization between SDRs, QTLs for adaptive traits67,68 and species divergence hot spots should also be carried out. The recent availability of a whole-genome sequence for Quercus46 will finally help to identify genes located in and underlying SDRs and the genes involved in RI.Authors' contributionsC.B. performed the genetic analysis, E.C. extracted the DNA, E.C. and C.B. carried out the genotyping analysis, F.E. updated the databases, C.B. and C.P. wrote the manuscript.

IntroductionVarious cohort studies of the human gut microbiome based on a metagenomic approach using next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been reported.1–11 These studies included patients with diseases such as obese,1 inflammatory bowel disease,2 type 2 diabetes,3,6 colon cancer,7,9 liver cirrhosis,8 and rheumatoid arthritis,11 as well as numbers of healthy individuals in various countries including the USA, several European countries, and China. In addition, several studies have reported on gut microbiomes of Asian children and natives from rural areas.12–16 These studies suggest that the human gut microbiome is more or less affected by various factors such as diet and host's genetic background,17 and the altered microbiome is associated with diseases.18 Several comparative analyses have also suggested a great diversity in human gut microbiomes at the population level,5,6,12–16,19 and even in those of patients with diseases.6,20 Essentially, human gut microbiomes can be classified into ‘enterotypes’ on the basis of differences in the abundance of a few major species largely linking with dietary habits.21,22Japanese (JP) have unique dietary culture and habits compared with Western people being reflected in the finding that their gut microbiomes have more genes for aquatic plant-derived polysaccharide-degrading enzymes than those of Americans.23 In addition, Japanese exhibit the highest average life span and very low body mass index (BMI).24 A study on the gut microbiomes of 13 Japanese individuals has been previously published.25 However, the dataset size was too small to allow comparison with other large datasets to evaluate distinct features of the Japanese gut microbiome (JPGM). Therefore, in this study, we collected and analysed the metagenomic data from gut microbiomes of 106 Japanese individuals by sequencing of fecal DNA samples using NGS, and we further explored the unique microbial and functional features of the JPGM using microbiome data from a total of 861 healthy individuals selected from 12 countries including Japan.2. Materials and methods2.1. Subjects and fecal sample collectionOne hundred and six Japanese volunteers [age: 32 ± 11, BMI: 22 ± 2.7 (mean ± S.D.), and male:female = 64:42] were recruited by Azabu University (Japan) from 2010 to 2013 (Supplementary Table S1). This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Azabu University and the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo, and written consent was obtained from all subjects. No subjects were treated with antibiotics during fecal sample collection. Among them, fecal samples were longitudinally collected twice from 26 individuals every 8 weeks and five times from 9 individuals every 2 weeks, of which 16 individuals were shared with the previous study.26 A total of 168 fecal samples were collected from the 106 individuals. The collected fresh feces were stored under anaerobic conditions in an AneroPack™ (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at 4°C. Within 36 h after sampling, the feces were frozen in 20% glycerol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan)/phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution (Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) by liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until ready for use.2.2. Recovery of bacteria from fecal samples and bacterial DNA isolationBacteria and bacterial DNA were prepared as described previously with minor modifications.26,27 In brief, the bacterial DNA was isolated by the enzymatic lysis method using lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LCC., Tokyo, Japan) and achromopeptidase (Wako). The DNA samples were purified by treatment with RNase A (Wako), followed by precipitation with 20% PEG solution (PEG6000 in 2.5 M NaCl). The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, rinsed with 75% ethanol, and dissolved in TE buffer.2.3. Metagenomic sequencing of fecal DNAThe fecal DNA samples were sequenced using 454 GS FLX Titanium and FLX+ (Roche), Ion PGM and Ion Proton (Life Technologies), and MiSeq (Illumina) sequencing system. The detailed protocols have been described in the Supplementary Text. In brief, after the quality filtering, reads mapped to the human genome (HG19) were removed. Artificially redundant reads from the 454 and Ion PGM/Proton sequencers were removed using a replicate filter.28 From the MiSeq filter-passed reads, reads mapped to the phiX bacteriophage genomes were also removed. Sequencing statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.2.4. PCR detection of Methanobrevibacter smithii in the Japanese individualsMethanobrevibacter smithii was detected by PCR using M. smithii 16S rRNA gene-specific primers 5'-ATGCACCTCCTCTCAGCTAGTC-3' and 5'-AGAGGTACTCCCAGGGTAGAGG-3'. The details have been described in the Supplementary Text.2.5. Publically available metagenomic sequence dataWe collected metagenomic sequence data of individuals from Denmark (DK), Spain (ES), the USA (US), China (CN), Sweden (SE), Russia (RU), Venezuela (VE), Malawi (MW), Austria (AT), France (FR), and Peru (PE). Metagenomic reads from DK2 and ES2 populations were downloaded from http://public.genomics.org.cn. Filter-passed reads from the US4 population were downloaded from the HMP DACC (http://www.hmpdacc.org). Raw reads for DK,29 ES,19 CN,3,8 SE,6 RU,5 AT,9 FR,7 PE,15 US,15 and VE30 were downloaded from public databases and subjected to the quality control prior to use under the same conditions as used for the JP data. The SOLiD reads from RU were subjected to error correction using the SOLiD Accuracy Enhancement Tool (SAET), and the quality control was performed as described previously.5 Raw reads for VE,14 MW,14 and US14 were downloaded from MG-RAST (http://metagenomics.anl.gov) and reads mapped to the human genome were excluded.2.6. Country-specific metagenomic datasets of healthy individualsTo construct metagenomic datasets from healthy individuals from each country, the data for individuals with BMI =30; those designated with the following diseases based on the literature: inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, liver cirrhosis, or colorectal cancer; and infants <3 yrs old were excluded from the data collected from a total of 1,734 individuals from the 12 countries. The exclusion of the patient and infant samples was to avoid the incorporation of altered gut microbiomes significantly different from the healthy adult gut microbiome.14,18 Although we could not access the metadata for individuals from US,4 we used all data from individuals with an average BMI of 24 ± 4 (mean ± S.D.) for this cohort. Finally, we selected and used a total of 861 healthy individuals from the 12 countries for the analysis (Supplementary Table S2).2.7. Construction of microbial reference genomesTo improve the efficiency and accuracy of taxonomic assignment of metagenomic sequences and to reduce excess load in computing, we constructed and used an in-house developed reference genome database from 2,788 complete and 22,317 draft genomes available from GenBank/EBI/DDBJ (as of July 2014), 20 genomes,31 and 2 unpublished genomes. The reference genome database comprises a total of 6,149 genomes representing 2,373 clusters at the species level of Bacteria and Archaea (Supplementary Table S3). Detailed procedures have been described in the Supplementary Text.2.8. Mapping of metagenomic reads to the reference genomesOne million metagenomic reads per individual were mapped to the reference genomes using Bowtie232 (version 2.2.1) with a 95% identity threshold. The number of multi-hit reads that mapped to several different genomes with identical scores was normalized by the proportion to the number of reads uniquely mapped to the genomes. The relative abundance of each genome was calculated by normalizing the number of reads mapped to the genome by the total number of reads mapped. NCBI taxonomy information was used for taxonomic assignment of phylum, genus, and species for each genome. Genomes that were not assigned to a particular taxonomic rank were assigned to the higher rank classification and designated ‘unclassified higher rank’. Detailed procedures have been described in the Supplementary Text.2.9. Comparison of microbial compositionsA multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot was constructed using the Jensen–Shannon divergence between microbial compositions at the genus level of the 861 individuals. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the Ward method based on the Bray–Curtis distances. A model to predict each country based on microbial composition at the genus level was constructed using the randomForest package in R. The predictive power of the model was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation with 90% of the training data and 10% of the prediction data. The number of trees was set to 500, and the sample size option was set to the minimum number of individuals among the countries. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of the predictive model were calculated and plotted with the smooth function using the ROCR and pROC packages. Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs)6 were used for evaluating similarities between microbial compositions from individuals within and between countries.To evaluate the effect of methodologies in the metagenomic analysis, three different subsets of fecal samples were subjected to analyses using different protocols in sequencing, DNA preparation, and fecal sample storage steps, respectively. Detailed procedures have been described in the Supplementary Text. The protocols used in the present and other studies are also summarized in Supplementary Table S4.Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) was used to assess the association of age and BMI with the gut microbiome structure using the adonis function in the Vegan package in R. The dietary intake information of the 12 countries was collected from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical (FAOSTAT) database (http://faostat3.fao.org/home/, as of June 2015). Details on the food data have been described in the Supplementary Text.2.10. Assembly of metagenomic sequences and gene prediction in the JPGMFor each JP individual, the filter-passed reads produced from 454 GS and Ion PGM/Proton and those from MiSeq were assembled using the Newbler assembler (version 2.7), respectively. The contigs generated were further assembled with Minimus233 using the default setting for each individual. Unassembled reads (singletons) from each sequencer in all individuals were combined and reassembled to obtain additional contigs formed between different samples. MetaGeneAnnotator34 was used to predict protein-coding genes (=100 bp) in the contigs (=500 bp) and singletons (=300 bp). Finally, ~4.9 million (M) non-redundant genes were identified in the JPGM by further clustering the predicted genes using CD-HIT35 with a 95% nucleotide identity and 90% length coverage cut-off.2.11. Generation of a JPGM and integrated gene catalog merged reference gene set of human gut microbiomesThe integrated gene catalog (IGC),19 which was constructed from metagenomic data of >1,000 gut microbiomes from DK, ES, US, and CN were downloaded from http://meta.genomics.cn/metagene/meta/home. The merged reference gene set was constructed by clustering the JPGM non-redundant genes (4.9 M) and the non-redundant genes (9.9 M) in the IGC using CD-HIT with a 95% nucleotide identity and 90% length coverage cut-off.2.12. Functional assignment of non-redundant genes in human gut microbiomesFunctional assignment of the non-redundant genes was performed using BLASTP searches (e-value =1.0e-5) against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (release 63) to obtain the KEGG orthologies (KOs). The genes with a best hit to eukaryotic genes were excluded from further analysis. Additionally, the non-redundant genes were searched using BLASTP (e-value =1.0e-5) against the eggNOG database36 (version 4.5) to assign them to non-supervised orthologous groups (NOGs). The phylum-level taxonomic assignment of the genes assigned to NOGs was conducted by BLASTN searches to the reference genomes with a =65% identity and =85% length coverage cut-off.2.13. Quantification of the annotated genes in human gut microbiomesOne million metagenomic reads per individual were mapped to the JPGM and IGC merged reference gene set using Bowtie2 with a 95% identity cut-off. To adjust the mapping conditions for long reads (e.g. 454 FLX + reads with an average read length of 730 bp) to the short reference genes with an average length of 620 bp, reads >100 bp were split into 100 bp fragments, which were used independently for similarity searches, while fragments <50 bp were discarded. The number of reads that mapped equally to more than one gene was normalized by the proportion of the number of reads uniquely mapped to the genes as was conducted for the mapping analysis to the reference genomes. The quantities of KOs were calculated from the number of reads mapped to them. We first compared the relative abundance of KOs between the 104 JP individuals and the 757 individuals in the other 11 countries using Student's t-test to enumerate the KOs enriched and depleted with statistical significance (adjusted P < 0.01) in the JPGM. Of them, those having the highest and lowest relative abundance among the 12 countries were identified. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hogberg method.3. Results3.1. Population-level diversity in the human gut microbiomeWe obtained approximately 350 Gb of filter-passed metagenomic reads with an average of 3.4 ± 1.9 Gb (mean ± S.D.) per individual by sequencing fecal DNA samples from the 106 JP individuals using 454 GS, Ion PGM/Proton, or MiSeq sequencers (Supplementary Table S1). To evaluate the microbial composition of the JPGMs, we mapped the metagenomic reads to the reference genomes. The relative abundances of the four dominant phyla were 59.7 ± 14.7% for Firmicutes, 21.8 ± 16.3% for Actinobacteria, 16.7 ± 10.4% for Bacteroidetes, and 1.4 ± 1.6% for Proteobacteria. At the genus level, Bifidobacterium was the most dominant species, accounting for 17.9 ± 15.2%. The results for taxonomic assignment are also presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.Next, we collected metagenomic data from 11 other countries to characterize the JPGM and to explore population-level variations in human gut microbiomes among the 12 countries. The independent cohort data were combined per country to construct country-specific metagenomic datasets of healthy individuals, from which data for individuals with BMI =30, those afflicted with known diseases, or infants <3 yrs were excluded. These country-specific datasets comprising data of a total of 861 healthy individuals including the 104 JP individuals were used for further analysis (Supplementary Table S2).We obtained the microbial compositions of the 861 individuals from the 12 countries using the same conditions as those used for the JPGM (Supplementary Fig. S2). The MDS plot of the microbial compositions of the 861 individuals showed that they tended to cluster together per country (Fig. 1A). A permutation test confirmed significantly higher similarity of the microbial composition between individuals within a country than between those of different countries (Fig. 1B). To test whether the microbial composition can predict an individual's country of origin, we used random forest analysis6,14 to construct a predictive model for the countries except VE and MW, for which sample numbers were too small to analyse. The result showed that the AUCs ranged from 0.82 to near 1.00 for each country (Fig. 1C), demonstrating the high predictive accuracy of the model. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that the human gut microbiome composition is significantly diverse across the 12 countries.

(C) ROC curves and AUC values from the randomForest model. Numbers in parentheses represent the AUC values of the 10 countries.To examine the effects of different protocols used in the present and other studies on the observed differences in the microbial composition (Supplementary Table S4), we compared and assessed variations in the microbial composition estimated from three different NGS sequencers, four different DNA extraction methods including two enzymatic lysis methods and two commercially available kits based on mechanical disruption of cells, and four different fecal sample storage conditions (Supplementary Table S5). For the fecal sample storage conditions, we focused on assessment of differences in the storage time from defecation until freezing of fecal samples, because it was considered to be varied among the studies. The results revealed that PCCs between the microbial compositions from different protocols were high (from 0.88 to 1.00) in any pair of comparisons between them and significantly higher than those observed for the individuals within and between countries (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). These data indicated that the methodological differences had no significant effects on the observed variations among the human gut microbiomes.Hierarchical clustering of the 12 countries based on the average microbial composition at the genus level showed that the JPGM was more similar to microbiomes of AT and SE than that of CN, while those of CN and US were most closely related, but far from the JPGM among the 12 countries (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results indicated that host ethnic and geographical closeness have no large influence on the overall microbial composition of the human gut microbiome. We also assessed the contribution of variations in age and BMI to differences in the microbial abundance by using PERMANOVA. The coefficient of determination for the variation (R2) in age and BMI was 0.16 (P-value = 0.14) and 0.2 (P-value = 0.07), respectively, indicating that both factors had no large influence on the observed results as well.We further examined the association of diet since it is known to be a major factor influencing microbial composition.22,37 We accessed the FAOSTAT database to collect the dietary intake data (g/capita/day) for 119 food items. Cluster analysis of the 12 countries based on the levels of three main nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) and nine food categories (Supplementary Fig. S6) segregated most of the Western countries from other countries in Asia, South America, and Africa (Supplementary Fig. S7). This indicated that the FAOSTAT data properly represent the current diversity in dietary habits of the 12 countries, allowing for its use in the association analysis with the microbial diversity. Comparison with the dendrogram of the 12 countries based on the microbial composition (Supplementary Fig. S5) revealed several inconsistencies in the relation among the countries. For example, CN had close relations with MW and PE due to the high similarity of dietary component with the high grains/beans and the low animal product level, while it had closer relations with several Western countries such as US, DK, and ES with the high abundance of Bacteroides than MW and PE in the microbial composition. Additionally, SE, FR, and AT were members in the Western group in the dietary component, while those were closer to Japan than other Western countries in the microbial composition. Thus, the population-level diversity in the human gut microbiome may not be relied on diet alone.3.2. Microbial characterization of the Japanese gut microbiomeWe identified 425 genera and 21 phyla of Bacteria and Archaea in the gut microbiomes of the 861 individuals. The genera with an average relative abundance of =0.5% in the 12 countries are listed in Supplementary Table S6. When comparing the abundance of the bacterial phyla, the JPGM showed the highest abundance of Actinobacteria. In contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the JPGM was significantly lower than in the microbiomes of various other countries (Fig. 2A). At the genus level, the JPGM was characterized by the highest abundance of Bidfidobacterium, Blautia, Collinsella, Streptococcus, and unclassified Clostridiales, but the lowest abundance of Clostridium, Alistipes, unclassified Firmicutes, Dialister, and Butyrivibrio among the 12 countries (Fig. 2B). Taxonomic comparison of gut microbiomes of populations from the 12 countries. Relative abundances of the four dominant phyla (A), the five genera most enriched and depleted in the JPGM (B), and M. smithii (C) in the 12 countries are shown. Vertical axes represent the relative abundance of the species calculated from the number of mapped reads to the reference genomes.Taxonomic comparison of gut microbiomes of populations from the 12 countries. Relative abundances of the four dominant phyla (A), the five genera most enriched and depleted in the JPGM (B), and M. smithii (C) in the 12 countries are shown. Vertical axes represent the relative abundance of the species calculated from the number of mapped reads to the reference genomes.Another characteristic feature of the JPGM was that it has the lowest frequency of M. smithii, a methanogenic archaeon, among the 12 countries (Fig. 2C). Metagenomic mapping analysis showed that this species was detected only in eight (7.7%) JP individuals, while it was detected in a proportion of 39–100% of the individuals in other countries (relative abundance =0.0001%, Supplementary Fig. S8a). The lowest prevalence of this archaeon in the JP cohort was also validated by PCR using species-specific 16S primers. The data showed that M. smithii was undetected in 97 (92%) of the 106 JP individuals both in the metagenomic mapping and in the PCR analysis, where 5 were positive in both analyses, 3 were positive only in the mapping analysis, and 1 was positive only in the PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S8b).3.3. Gene numbers in the Japanese gut microbiomesWe performed de novo assembly of filter-passed metagenomic reads from the JP individuals by using the Newbler individually to generate 13 Gb of contigs of =500 bp and 0.6 Gb of singletons of =300 bp, in which approximately 23 M genes were predicted with MetaGeneAnnotator. By further clustering of the 23 M genes using CD-HIT, we finally obtained 4,854,719 non-redundant genes in the JPGM. Rarefaction analysis of the number of non-redundant genes against the number of individuals sequenced showed that the genes shared by =1.9% (2/106) in the JP individuals were almost constant with approximately 100 individuals, while genes unique for an individual (=1%) increased even beyond 100 individuals (Supplementary Fig. S9a). The number of the genes shared by =1.9% (2/106) in the JP individuals represented about 3.8 M, which covered 98.8% of the total reads mapped to the non-redundant genes. These results suggested that the JPGM non-redundant gene set covers most of the genes encoded by the JPGM. In contrast, =50% of the JP individuals commonly possessed 0.19 M genes (4.0%), which can be considered to be core genes of the JPGM (Supplementary Fig. S9b).3.4. Comparison of the JPGM and IGC gene setsWe compared the JPGM gene set with the IGC gene set.19 The clustering of the JPGM (4.9 M) and the IGC genes (9.9 M) generated 11,929,034 non-redundant genes in total, in which 585,856 genes and 202,410 genes were excluded by being merged to longer authentic genes in either of the datasets. As a result, 4,268,863 and 9,676,237 non-redundant genes constituted the JPGM and IGC gene sets, respectively. The data showed that approximately 2.0 M genes were shared by both gene sets, and 2.3 and 7.7 M genes were unique to the JPGM and IGC, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S10a). This limited overlap between the JPGM and IGC gene sets was supported by the mapping analysis of metagenomic reads, in which 45.6% of the JPGM metagenomic reads were mapped to the IGC gene set, while 80.0% were mapped to the JPGM gene set (Supplementary Fig. S10b).Next, we annotated the functions of the genes with the KEGG database. The analysis identified 5,789 KOs in the JPGM and a total of 6,205 KOs from both gene sets, in which 5,613 KOs (90%) were shared between both datasets, demonstrating a significantly high similarity in functional profiles across the populations despite the small overlap in the gene sequences. It was noted that the IGC-unique 416 KOs included multiple genes related to archaeal methane metabolism, while the JPGM-unique 176 KOs included more genes for spore formation than the IGC-unique KOs (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).3.5. Quantitative evaluation of functional profiles of human gut microbiomesTo explore functions that are enriched or depleted in the JPGM compared with microbiomes from the 11 other countries, we mapped the metagenomic reads of the 861 individuals to the JPGM and IGC merged gene set. By comparing the numbers of mapped reads, we identified 563 and 521 KOs having the highest and lowest abundances in the JPGM among the 12 countries with statistical significance (Fig. 3). The overrepresented KOs included functions for carbohydrate metabolism such as glucan 1,3-ß-glucosidase (K01210), 6-phospho-ß-galactosidase (K01220), and gluconokinase (K00851), and for membrane transport such as the phosphotransferase system of simple sugars including mannose, lactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine (K02796, K02787, and K02746). Thus, metabolic pathways for simple sugars such as mono- and oligosaccharides were significantly enriched in the JPGM compared with the other datasets. On the other hand, the depleted KOs included functions such as cell motility including chemotaxis protein CheX (K03409) and flagellar protein FliO/FilZ (K02418), replication and repair including DNA mismatch repair protein MutL (K03572) and DNA adenine methylase (K06223), suggesting a depletion of functions related to host immunity and DNA damage in the JPGM. Many of the depleted KOs involved in energy metabolism and translation originated from archaea. Enriched and depleted functions in the JPGM. Functional categories of the KOs most enriched and depleted in the JPGM compared with those of the other 11 countries are shown.

The vertical axis represents the proportion of KOs assigned to the category. Asterisks indicate adjusted P < 0.01 (Fisher's exact test).In agreement with the lowest prevalence of M. smithii in the JP cohort, many of the KOs involved in methanogenesis were depleted in the JPGM. Of the 25 known KOs involved in methanogenesis, 18 were significantly depleted in the JPGM with the lowest abundance among the 12 countries (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S11). Conversely, we found a significant enrichment for multiple KOs involved in acetogenesis (the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway) in the JPGM. Of the 17 known KOs involved in acetogenesis, 13 were significantly enriched in the JPGM compared with the other 11 countries, and 5 of them had the highest abundance among the 12 countries (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S11). These two pathways utilize hydrogen to generate methane and acetate, respectively. Furthermore, the abundance of five genes known to be involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR), which is the third pathway for hydrogen metabolism, was similar between the JPGM and other gut microbiomes (Fig. 4). These results indicated that the JPGM had a clear inverse pattern in the abundance of the KOs between methanogenesis and acetogenesis compared with all other microbiomes, suggesting a prominent difference in the pathways for hydrogen utilization in the gut between Japanese and other populations.

Gene families enriched in the Japanese populationWe comprehensively surveyed gene families that are frequently present in the JP cohort by using the eggNOG database, which includes more compiled gene families than the KEGG database. The annotation of the merged JPGM and IGC non-redundant genes yielded 51,250 NOGs. In this analysis, we used 10 M metagenomic reads per individual to detect a low content of NOGs, so that 60 individuals having <10 M reads, including all individuals from MW and VE, were excluded from this analysis.We mapped 10 M reads from 801 individuals to the merged non-redundant genes to detect the NOGs in the individual. For these NOGs, we compared the proportion of individuals possessing them in the JP cohort and with the average proportion of the individuals in the nine other countries (Fig. 5). The results revealed 52 NOGs comprising a total of 1,114 genes that were detected in significantly higher proportions in the JP cohort than in the 9 other datasets using a threshold of a proportion of >70% in the JP cohort, an average proportion of <30% in other countries, and a ratio of JP/others of =3 (Supplementary Table S11). Of the 1,114 genes, 63% were taxonomically assigned to the known phyla. Among the 52 NOGs, 30 (58%), 8 (15%), and 5 NOGs (10%) were assigned to only the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, respectively, and 9 other NOGs were distributed over more than two phyla (Supplementary Fig. S12a). The high fraction of Actinobacteria may reflect the highest abundance of this phylum in the JP cohort among the 12 countries. Among the eight NOGs assigned to the Bacteroidetes, three NOGs (ENOG4108ZIS, ENOG4108MQB, and ENOG4105WVE), that were detected in approximately 90% of the JP individuals and in about 15% of other populations with the highest ratio of JP/others, were represented by the genes for aquatic plant-derived polysaccharide-degrading enzymes such as ß-porphyranase (hydrolase family 16) and ß-agarase published previously.23,38 The functional distribution of the 52 NOGs revealed that 35% were of unknown function and no particular function was enriched (Supplementary Fig. S12b).

The comparative analysis of the high-quality metagenomic datasets revealed a significant population-level diversity in the human gut microbiome across the 12 countries. The accuracy and reliability of this finding are supported by the use of a larger dataset including more populations than those analysed in the previous studies and by the statistical assessment indicating no significant effects of differences in experimental protocols, BMI, and age on the observed results. Thus, we provided the evidence for great variations in structure and function of human gut microbiomes of healthy adults at the population level.The present study also revealed various features specific to the JPGM. The JPGM showed the highest abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria among the microbiomes of the 12 countries, mainly because of the highest abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium. The high abundance of Bifidobacterium has been also observed in the gut microbiome of Japanese children based on the 16S rRNA gene analysis,12 indicating it is highly prevalent throughout the Japanese population. Bifidobacterium is thought to be a beneficial microbe having more glycoside hydrolases for degrading starch than other intestinal microbes.39,40 Therefore, the high abundance of Bifidobacterium can be considered to be the consequence of the intake of various saccharides in traditional and unique Japanese foods. However, at present, it is unknown exactly which foods or nutrients unique to Japanese contribute to the high abundance of Bifidobacterium.Additionally, the JPGM was characterized by various unique functional features. For example, the high carbohydrate metabolism capacity in the JPGM may result in the production of high levels of short chain fatty acids and hydrogen as end products, both of which seems to be clinically beneficial.41,42 Concurrently, we found a depletion of deleterious functions such as cell motility, and replication and repair, suggesting a low abundance of the flagellated microbes leading to reduced pro-inflammatory responses by host cells and lowered DNA damage to be repaired in the gut of the Japanese. Together, such a gut ecosystem of benefit functionally might be globally associated with the highest average life span of Japanese in the world.A remarkable depletion of the archaeon M. smithii was also characteristic of the JPGM, resulting in an overall depletion of genes for methanogenesis. In contrast, genes for acetogenesis, which are exclusively encoded by anaerobic acetogens such as the major species Blautia,43 were enriched in the JPGM as compared with the other gut microbiomes. Both methanogenesis and acetogenesis are considered to be critical pathways for hydrogen consumption in the gut because these pathways are tightly linked with anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates producing hydrogen.44 Our findings suggest that acetogenesis is the preferable pathway for hydrogen metabolism in the JPGM, while methanogenesis is more actively utilized for hydrogen metabolism in many of the other gut microbiomes. In this context, since the abundance of intestinal M. smithii is positively associated with the level of breath methane,45 our data strongly suggest that M. smithii is the primary factor for ethnic differences in the level of methane in human breath reported previously.46,47Finally, the similarities and dissimilarities in the microbial composition in the gut microbiome across the 12 countries cannot simply be explained by diet alone, although several papers have suggested its large contribution to the shaping of the gut microbiome.13,14,22 Our findings suggest the existence of factors in addition to, or other than, diet that affect the human gut microbiome, but further studies are required to solve this puzzling difference.Data availabilityAll bacterial metagenomic sequences were deposited in DDBJ under accession number PRJDB3601.

IntroductionSelection is one of the most important processes behind evolution of organisms. Inference of selection is made possible by statistical methods that utilize DNA sequence data of multiple individuals.1–4 A common way is to align protein-coding DNA sequences at the codon level to distinguish between non-synonymous (amino acid changing) and synonymous (amino acid maintaining) codon changes. Based on the distinction, the selective pressure at the protein-coding level can be measured by the ratio of non-synonymous substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate: dN/dS = <U+0277>. dN/dS > 1 is a signal of selection that favours recurrent non-synonymous substitutions (amino acid changes) in the protein or diversifying selection. It has been widely applied to sequences of various species including highly recombining bacteria.5–7Inference of diversifying selection (here, we define it as selection for amino acid changes that maintains diversity of amino acid residues at a codon) by dN/dS in recombining bacterial genomes is, however, methodologically challenging. A reason is that estimation of dN/dS usually requires a phylogenetic tree that assumes no recombination between sequences. Recombination changes phylogeny and affects estimation of dN/dS, and ignoring recombination causes false positives.8,9 A common way to deal with it is to exclude recombining sequences in advance.7,10 Otherwise, to analyse recombining sequences, there has been only one popular method called ‘omegaMap’, which can infer diversifying selection at the codon level by estimating dN/dS after averaging over all possible phylogenetic trees.11 The method is thus applicable to highly recombining sequences although it is computationally intensive.Due to this methodological difficulty, an unanswered question is how codons under diversifying selection (with dN/dS > 1) in a highly recombining bacterial species are distributed in a genome physically and functionally. Furthermore, a related and more general unanswered question is whether codons under diversifying selection are more frequently subject to mutual homologous recombination between lineages compared with the other regions in a bacterial genome.In this study, we explore these two questions in Helicobacter pylori, one of the bacterial species with the highest mutation and recombination rates.12–14Helicobacter pylori infects the human stomach during childhood and evolves inside each host by mutation and mutual homologous recombination primarily through natural transformation. A previous search for codons under diversifying selection in this organism focused on some parts of the genome.6 We extend this to the entire dataset of all one-to-one orthologous genes and genes present in >90% among 29 genomes of H. pylori. We then infer intensity of homologous recombination at each polymorphic nucleotide site by a recently developed method for the bacterial core genome,15 and explore a potential relationship between diversifying selection and intensity of homologous recombination.Our genome-wide survey revealed that the codons under diversifying selection were widely distributed and accounted for ~0.2% in the genome. These codons were enriched in gene categories of host interaction/cell surface and genome maintenance, and appeared to be more frequently subject to mutual homologous recombination.2. Materials and methods2.1. Helicobacter pylori genome sequences of global strains and alignment of genesWe used complete genome sequences of 29 H. pylori strains from various regions in the world, which were analysed in our preceding study.16 They were annotated and classified into phylogeographic groups: hpAfrica1, J99, Gambia94; hpEurope, 26695, HPAG1, Lithuania75, P12, G27, B38, B8; hpAsia2, India 7, Santal49 (SNT49); hspAmerind, Puno120, Puno135, Sat464, Shi470, Cuz20, v225d; hspEastAsia, 35A, F57, F30, F16, 83, OK310, 51, 52, F32, OK113. There were also two hybrid strains: SJM180 and PeCan4. We then prepared sequence alignment dataset of each gene (orthologous group). An entire dataset of orthologous genes was prepared based on clustering by DomClust17 and RECOG (http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/RECOG/).For each gene (orthologous group), we aligned the nucleotide sequences by PRANK with the ‘codon’ option, which uses a codon substitution matrix.18 PRANK uses evolutionary information in determining where to place gaps. This improves the quality of alignment,19 which has been shown to affect detection of selection considerably.20,212.2. Search for codons under diversifying selectionWe used the omegaMap11 to infer dN/dS and diversifying selection at the codon level in recombining sequences of all one-to-one orthologous genes and genes present in >90% among 29 genomes of H. pylori. The omegaMap uses a population genetics approximation to the coalescent with recombination, and reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to perform Bayesian inference on variation of dN/dS ratio along a DNA sequence.11 It does not assume a specific phylogenetic tree, but instead considers averaging over all possible trees based on the Hidden Markov model. Two independent MCMC chains were run for 500,000 iterations with a thinning (sampling) interval of 10 and a burn-in of 10% of the iterations. The average length of a block of dN/dS was set to be 10 codons. We extracted codons carrying non-synonymous polymorphism that satisfied both estimated dN/dS > 1 and a posterior probability of diversifying selection >0.999. We use the stringent criterion because we put priority on decreasing false positives although it in turn increases false negatives. Among 5,374 codons that satisfied these criteria and were located in the reference genome, we excluded those in hypothetical genes with >7% nucleotide diversity (3,629 codons, ~68%) listed in Supplementary Table S1 because their entire coding region seemed to have decayed. We assessed the convergence of the MCMC chains by the Gelman–Rubin convergence diagnostic (PSRF)22 that is calculated from within-chain and between-chain variance of two independent runs; PSRF <1.2 is usually taken as indicating convergence.23,24 We confirmed that about 76% of the 1,745 codons after the filtering above showed the convergence. We did not include the remaining 24% into codons under diversifying selection. The convergence diagnostic (PSRF) was calculated by the R package CODA25 and EDISON.262.3. Functional categorization of each geneWe classified genes based on the functional categories in Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis (MBGD).27,28 We defined five major functional categories for this study as follows: ‘basic cellular functions’ defined as ‘Energy metabolism’, ‘Transport and binding proteins’, ‘Translation’, and ‘Cellular processes’ major categories (except for ‘Cell killing’ and ‘Motility’ subcategories) in MBGD; ‘host interaction/cell surface’ including outer membrane and lipopolysaccharide-related proteins, ‘Cell envelope’, major category, ‘Cell killing’, ‘Motility’, ‘Membranes, lipoproteins, and porins’, ‘Murein sacculus and peptidoglycan’, ‘Surface polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides and antigens’, and ‘Surface structures’ subcategories; Restriction modification (‘RM’) including the RM system; ‘DNA replication, recombination, and repair’ including ‘DNA replication, restriction, modification, recombination, and repair’ except for the RM system; ‘hypothetical’ as ‘Hypothetical’ and ‘Hypothetical (no functional assignment)’ categories; ‘others’ as all the other genes.2.4. Protein 3D structure prediction and modellingFor genes carrying a codon under diversifying selection, in order to investigate possible structure–function implication of the residues under diversifying selection (dN/dS > 1), we mapped them together with functionally important residues (e.g. active sites and ligand-binding sites) on the structural models of their protein products. Protein fold recognition (identification of templates with experimentally determined structure) was carried out using the GeneSilico MetaServer.29 Alignments between the sequences of H. pylori proteins and the structures of the best templates identified by different FR methods were used to carry out comparative modelling using the ‘FRankenstein's Monster’ approach,30,31 with the use of MODELLER32 and Swiss-Model33 methods. HP0279, HP0462, HP0790, and HP1553 structures were modelled using crystal structures with the following Protein Data Bank34 codes: 1psw, 1yf2, 1yf2, and 3u4q, respectively.2.5. Calculation of nucleotide diversity along the genomeWe calculated nucleotide diversity of each gene by VariScan version 2.0.35 We also calculated nucleotide diversity at a polymorphic site by sliding windows implemented in VariScan version 2.0.35 We used the sliding windows with step size 1 bp and window size 15 or 30 bp. We checked that the two different sizes of the window showed consistent results. We wrote results that used the windows size of 15 bp, which is almost the same as a previous estimate of median size of chunks of DNA sharing the same ancestry (donor of the most recent recombination) in the H. pylori genome.162.6. Estimation of intensity of homologous recombination per nucleotideWe used a recently developed method to infer relative intensity of homologous recombination at a single nucleotide resolution in the bacterial genome.15 As its input, we prepared genome-wide haplotype data by combining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) without missing data on each orthologous gene while preserving information of SNP positions. The method focuses on genetic elements that have high rates of movement by homologous recombination in a species, and calculates values of the statistic Di that is highly correlated with the number of recombination events or DNA imports at a nucleotide i. The statistic captures deviation from genome average at a nucleotide due to recombination, and the value reflects how frequently DNA is transferred between individuals. It can be calculated for polymorphic nucleotides that do not have missing data.We calculated a normalized version of Di as a statistic Hi (representing recombination hotness), so that its mean and S.D. become 0 and 1, respectively.363. Results3.1. Genes and codons under diversifying selectionIn all one-to-one orthologous genes and genes present in >90% among 29 global strains of H. pylori, we searched for codons under diversifying selection (with dN/dS > 1) by using the omegaMap method developed for recombining sequences.11 As a result, we found codons under diversifying selection in 134 loci. They accounted for ~11% of the genes. These genes were widely distributed across the genome (Fig. 1, sorted by their positions in Supplementary Table S2). The codons accounted for ~0.2% in the genome. There was no relationship between distribution of the codons and direction of replication (i.e. ori to dif, or from dif to ori, in which there was no significant difference by the <U+03C7>2 test). The inferred dN/dS value and probability of diversifying selection are listed for each of the codons in Supplementary Table S3.

The two set of circles distinguish the plus (outer) and minus (inner) strand, respectively. On each strand, the codons under diversifying selection that allowed estimation of intensity of homologous recombination (that is, no gap in 29 genomes' alignment) are shown in dark (red), while the others are in light (yellow).

These codons were accounted for >13% in each of the following three categories (Fig. 2): ‘host interaction/cell surface’, ‘DNA replication, recombination, and repair’, and ‘RM (restriction modification)’, as detailed below. The proportion in ‘host interaction/cell surface’ is significantly higher than other categories (P= 0.01, <U+03C7>2 test). It is also significantly higher across the other two groups (P= 0.0003, <U+03C7>2 test), both of which are responsible for the maintenance of bacterial genome and usually classified into a group as in the MBGD database.

Genes for host interaction/cell surface with a codon under diversifying selectionIn this category, we examined genes for outer membrane proteins and for lipopolysaccharide synthesis in detail. Of the genes for lipopolysaccharide synthesis, we mapped the selected site of WaaC (HP0279) onto its structural model (Fig. 3A). WaaC catalyses the addition of the first heptose moiety to the inner core of a lipopolysaccharide. The residue (Y229) is located close to the critical glutamic acid residue (‘E’ in Fig. 3A) that forms hydrogen bonds with the pentose ring of the ADP moiety of the sugar donor.37Amino acid residues under diversifying selection mapped on structural models. Residues under diversifying selection (dN/dS > 1) in H. pylori proteins are shown as red spheres, and those interacting with any ligand in homologous proteins are shown as yellow spheres.

The 44 positions shown in red correspond to the codons under diversifying selection.Among other genes in this category, amiA (HP0772) produces N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, which is required for modification of the cell wall peptidoglycan, an essential step for morphological transition into the coccoid form.38tlpA (HP0099) produces a chemotaxis receptor protein for sensing arginine and bicarbonate.393.3. Genes for DNA replication, recombination, repair, and RM system with a codon under diversifying selectionHelicase/nuclease/recombinase encoded by addA (=adnA=pcrA) (HP1553) is functionally related to the RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli, which degrades non-self DNA of invading genetic elements but repairs self DNA marked by a genome identification sequence called chi.40,41 Large divergence in this gene was previously reported between East Asian and European H. pylori.42 We mapped the residue under diversifying selection onto the structural model of the RecB subunit of RecBCD enzyme (Fig. 3B). The residues (680 and 681, red spheres) are located in the 2A motor domain responsible for ATP-dependent translocation of the protein along DNA in the vicinity of the ATP-binding site.43 We also found a codon with diversifying selection in other components of DNA replication/repair/recombination machinery (gyrA, ruvA, and rnhA).RM systems consist of a modification enzyme activity that transfers a methyl group to a specific DNA sequence and a restriction enzyme activity that cleaves DNA lacking such methylation. They are responsible for distinction of self DNA from non-self DNA by epigenetic methylation of a specific DNA sequence. They destroy viral DNA or other invading DNA genome of a different epigenome. Their genes behave as mobile genetic elements.44 They frequently change their recognition sequences and their expression, and it is to be expected that codons under diversifying selection were found in such genes. Comparative analyses predicted that H. pylori contains an unusually large number of diverse RM systems with a high degree of heterogeneity.45 However, further biochemical analyses showed that only some of them retain enzymatic activity.46,47Among the RM systems, type I RM systems consist of R, M, and S (specificity) subunits, encoded by three host specificity determinant (hsd) genes. The S–M complex exhibits the modification activity, while the S–M–R complex exhibits the restriction activity. The restriction enzyme cleaves random DNA between distant target sites. In HP0464, the nine residues under diversifying selection correspond to the C-terminal unclassified domain of predicted alpha-helical structure of R subunit from E. coli pR124.48 The specificity (S) subunit is essential in determining the recognition sequence through its two target recognition domains (TRDs). The TRDs are highly variable even between members of the same family49 and can be ‘swapped’ between related systems to generate novel DNA specificities.50 In addition, the S subunit contains two conserved regions (CRs) in the middle and at the C terminus, that form a long antiparallel a colied-coil.51 The coiled coil acts as a molecular ruler for the separation between two recognized DNA sequences.51 Codons of diversifying selection were found in two S proteins (HP0462 and HP0790) in addition to the R protein (HP0464). The genes, encoding HP0462 and HP0464, are located within the same genomic RM cluster, and possibly act in one complex. Tertiary structures of HP0462 and HP0790 were modelled using the structure of the S subunit from Methanococcus jannaschii51 (PDB: 1YF2) as a template. All but one codons (10/11) of diversifying selection in HP0462 correspond to the alpha-helical CRs (Fig. 3C), in agreement with the known mechanism that the orientation of DNA-binding sites is an essential feature defining the mode of DNA recognition by S proteins.52 In HP0790, the 44 residues under diversifying selection are distributed across each domain: 21 positions are located within TRD1, 4 within CR1, 8 within TRD2, 10 within CR2, and 1 on the C-terminal beta-strand (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, some of the residues mapping to TRD1 are located close to the predicted DNA-binding cleft (P38, K42, N43, E52, K89, Q107, and I141 in HP0790). In contrast to HP0462, sites under diversifying selection in HP0790 are scattered throughout the entire protein. We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that HP0790 is not co-expressed with other RM components, and thus might be subjected to stronger evolutionary pressure that influences not only positioning of DNA-binding clefts, but also their function.Unlike the type I RM systems, type II R and M subunits act independently, and therefore must independently recognize the same target sequence. Therefore, they may not be able to rapidly alter their DNA sequence specificity: even a small change in a sequence recognized by the R subunit, without an equivalent change in the M subunit, specificity would result in host toxicity. Among them, HP0668 (putative R subunit) and mHP0669 (putative M subunit) have unusually a high number of codons with diversifying selection: 124 and 337, respectively. However, transcriptome annotations for H. pylori indicate that only mHP0669 is expressed.53 Therefore, despite the conservation of the residues from a potential methyltransferase active site in mHP0669, both genes might be in the process of pseudogenization.3.4. Other genes with a codon under diversifying selectionWe noted several genes related to virulence and host colonization in the lists. These include previously reported cagPAI genes (cagC and cagY in addition to the most famous cagA6), flagella-related genes, and poly E-rich protein. We earlier identified several such codons in cagA.54 They also included a transcription factor (rpoD), genes for chemotaxis, metabolism of amino acids, and nucleotides. We do not know whether they represent their adaptation to nutritional environments. The hemA (HP0239) product catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of haem and copes with oxidative DNA damage.55ackA encoding acetate kinase decayed in several strains in different geographical regions.42 Their non-synonymous mutations may have inactivated those genes to advantage.3.5. Intensity of homologous recombination in nucleotides under diversifying selectionNext, we estimated the intensity of homologous recombination at each polymorphic nucleotide by a statistic Hi representing recombination hotness at nucleotide i. This is a normalized version of statistic Di, which well correlates with the number of homologous recombination events or DNA imports covering the nucleotide.15 The average and standard deviation of Hi is normalized to be 0 and 1 in a genome, and its high values indicate recombination hot nucleotides in the genome that are apparently frequently transferred among individual lineages as a result of homologous recombination. We found that distribution of the Hi values in the H. pylori genome was almost normal but had some outliers, which can be regarded as the recombination hot nucleotides (Fig. 4). Comparison of the intensity of homologous recombination between nucleotides under diversifying selection (red in Fig. 1) and others not under diversifying selection clearly showed elevation in the former (Fig. 5). The median value is 2.20 in the codons under diversifying selection and -0.05 in the other codons (P < 10-6, Wilcoxon's rank sum test).

Intensity of homologous recombination in the nucleotides under diversifying selection compared with those not under diversifying selection.However, the estimated intensity of homologous recombination was positively correlated with nucleotide diversity in the genome (Supplementary Fig. S1) as reported previously.15 In addition, nucleotide diversity was higher in the codons under diversifying selection (Supplementary Fig. S2, P< 10-15, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Therefore, nucleotide diversity is a confounding factor, which is positively correlated with both diversifying selection and the intensity of homologous recombination estimated from the sequence data. We thus took a matching-based approach in which for each ‘case’ nucleotide that is under diversifying selection and allowed estimation of intensity of recombination (Hi), we chose a ‘control’ nucleotide that is not under diversifying selection and has the closest level of nucleotide diversity. We confirmed that there is almost no difference in nucleotide diversity between them (Fig. 6A), and examined difference in the intensity of recombination. As a result, we found that the intensity of recombination is significantly higher in the nucleotides under diversifying selection (Fig. 6B, P < 10-13).

DiscussionIn this study, we first conducted a genome-wide survey of genes with a codon under diversifying selection by utilizing the omegaMap method11 developed for recombining sequences. Although the method is computationally intensive, we conducted the genome-wide survey for the 29 genomes in various geographical regions by using super computers. It succeeded in identifying ~0.2% of codons in the genome as under diversifying selection, reflecting high genetic diversity of the H. pylori genomes.The genes carrying a codon under diversifying selection were statistically enriched in the ‘host interaction/cell surface’ category. Diversifying selection on outer membrane protein genes was reported for six strains of E. coli and Shigella flexneri.7 Diversifying selection on a gene (rfaC) involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was reported in the same study. They are likely to change bacterial interaction with the host.56Diversifying selection in RM genes may reflect the evolutionary combat with viruses and other invading DNA elements consistent with the Red Queen model.57 Diversifying selection of the methyltransferases will cause changes in bacterial methylome, which would affect global gene expression and phenotype and might change interaction with their host. RM systems indeed frequently change their presence/absence, their sequence specificity, and their expression, which affect gene expression.44,58,59Recently, a study explored signatures of selective sweep in each of several geographical subpopulations.60 Our study is complementary to that analysis, because we explored signatures of diversifying selection that are maintained across different strains of H. pylori. In addition, our analyses are codon level rather than gene level, and have higher resolution in identifying signatures of selection across a genome.Next, based on the estimation of intensity of homologous recombination at the nucleotide level by the recently developed method,15 we revealed that the codons under diversifying selection could be more frequently transferred by recombination between individual genomes in this bacterial species. This sheds a new light on evolutionary roles of bacterial recombination.61 It would be consistent with the Red Queen-like selection regime62 in interaction with the host, in which recombination plays an advantageous role by bringing an unusual allele into a population and promoting diversification of the recombined region.Some preceding studies reported association between diversifying selection and recombination in bacterial genomes.5,63,64 Our studies have three major differences from these works. First, they used the PAML for inference of diversifying selection, which is not applicable to recombining sequences. Second, they examined the association at gene level rather than codon level. Third, they did not mention and account for the confounding effect of nucleotide diversity. They listed genes with signs of recombination and those under diversifying selection, and reported the proportion of overlap between them.To our knowledge, this is the first study that revealed distribution and proportion of the codons under diversifying selection across a genome of a highly recombining bacterial species. We also showed that the codons under diversifying selection could be more frequently subject to recombination. Our approach and the results provide a new direction of population genomic studies of selection in recombining prokaryotes.5.

IntroductionDNA markers are essential tools for molecular genetics and genomics. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs, also called microsatellites) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most powerful and widely used DNA markers. SSRs have the advantages of being both co-dominant and multi-allelic in nature, but they require time-consuming gel or capillary electrophoresis analyses. On the other hand, SNPs, most of which are co-dominant but bi-allelic, can be analysed using time-saving gel-free techniques, e.g. TaqMan assays,1 Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP; LGC, London, UK), and high-resolution melting analysis (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT). Microarray-based SNP chip technologies, e.g. GoldenGate and Infinium (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and Axiom (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), have enabled high-throughput SNP genotyping and thereby contributed to statistical genetic approaches, e.g. quantitative trait locus analyses and genome-wide association studies.2,3 However, SNP microarrays have a disadvantage, namely, the lack of flexibility in experimental design. Progress in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has enabled the development of huge numbers of SNPs in both model and non-model plant species, including crops.4 Correspondingly, SNP genotyping by NGS, e.g. genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq), have recently become popular due to their flexibility and relatively low cost.5GBS was initially developed in maize6 and subsequently applied to other crop species.7 In the original GBS protocol, genomic DNA is digested with restriction enzymes, and adapters are ligated to the restriction ends.6 Sequencing data of single-end reads are always obtained from sites associated with the restriction ends, which is a great advantage in sequencing of identical loci across multiple samples. The RAD-Seq method,8 which is similar to GBS, has been applied to several plant species.5,7 In the original RAD-Seq protocol, genomic DNA is fragmented twice by different methods: first by a restriction enzyme, and second by physical shearing. The resultant DNA fragments, with restriction sites on one end and sheared ends on the other, are targeted for single-end sequencing analysis from the restriction ends. On the other hand, paired-end sequence reads can be more accurately mapped onto the reference genome than single-end reads, especially in plants, which often have large and complex polyploid genomes.9 Double-digest restriction site-associated DNA-Seq (ddRAD-Seq), in which a second restriction enzyme is employed for digestion of genome DNA to reduce cost and time to prepare the sequencing libraries, enables paired-end sequencing of identical loci across multiple samples.10 Therefore, from the point of view of high accuracy read mapping even in the complex plant genomes, ddRAD-Seq technology has the advantage over GBS and RAD-Seq. Along with the great advances in the sequencing technology, several data processing pipelines for GBS and RAD-Seq have been reported.11,12 However, as mentioned, plants have complex genomes due to many types of ploidy, reproduction systems as well as various genome sizes. Therefore, data processing methods with flexibility in manipulation would be required.Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of several plant species has been accelerated by NGS technology; as of June 2015, genome sequence data are available from >100 plants.13 This situation makes it possible to simulate ddRAD-Seq in silico, allowing prediction of the numbers, sizes, and genome positions of digested fragments. Based on in silico analysis, the optimal restriction enzymes for ddRAD-Seq analyses are chosen.10 However, few reports have evaluated the in silico predictions by comparative experiments using several combinations of restriction enzymes and multiple samples with different SNP density. Moreover, it remains unclear what fraction of the SNPs in the whole genome can be detected by ddRAD-Seq. In this study, we performed in silico simulation of ddRAD-Seq analysis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and validated the predictions by empirical ddRAD-Seq data using an optimized protocol. We selected tomato for this demonstration because of the richness of available genome information14 and the diversity of available tomato lines.15 In addition, we investigated the numbers of SNPs detected by ddRAD-Seq in six inbred tomato lines with different densities of genome-wide SNPs. To evaluate the quality of the SNPs, we performed linkage analyses of the SNPs identified in an F2 mapping population and constructed genetic linkage maps. Finally, we proposed an analytical workflow for the ddRAD-Seq procedure including a pipeline for data processing.2. Materials and methods2.1. Processing data for whole-genome sequence of tomatoTwo tomato lines, Micro-Tom and Regina, were used as controls for empirical and in silico ddRAD-Seq and establishment of computational data processing pipelines. Published WGS data for Micro-Tom (accession number of DRX020765: Illumina data)16 and Regina (accession numbers of DRX011585 and DRX011586: SOLiD data)15 were used to generate a genome-wide SNP dataset. The WGS reads of the two lines were treated to remove low-quality reads and to trim adapters as described below (Computational processing for data from empirical ddRAD-Seq analysis), and mapped onto the tomato (cultivar Heinz 1706) reference genome sequences, version SL2.50, with Bowtie2 (version 2.2.3; parameters: -I 100 -X 500)17 and Bowtie (version 1.0; parameters: -l 15 -e 1,000),18 respectively. Subsequent SNP calling was also performed as below (Computational processing for data from empirical ddRAD-Seq analysis).The genome sequence of tomato (SL2.50; https://www.sgn.cornell.edu) as well as those of Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10; https://www.arabidopsis.org), Lotus japonicus (build 3.0; http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus), and Oryza sativa (Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0; http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp) were in silico treated with five restriction enzymes, e.g. EcoRI (recognition at site G<U+2193>AATTC), HindIII (A<U+2193>AGCTT), MspI (C<U+2193>CGG), PstI (CTGCA<U+2193>G), and SalI (G<U+2193>TCGAC): the genome sequence was digested into restriction fragments at the points of the recognition sites of the enzymes, and information on sizes of each fragment was retained.2.2. Plant materialsSix inbred tomato lines (Ailsa Craig, Micro-Tom, M82, Moneymaker, Regina, and San Marzano) were used for ddRAD-Seq analysis. All lines except for Regina were obtained from the National BioResource Project through the University of Tsukuba, Japan (accession numbers: Micro-Tom, TOMJPF00001; Moneymaker, TOMJPF00002; Ailsa Craig, TOMJPF00004; and M82, TOMJPF00005) and the Tomato Genetic Resource Center, University of California, Davis, USA (San Marzano, LA3008). Regina was commercially available from Sakata Seed Corporation (Yokohama, Japan). An F2 mapping population RMF2, consisting of 96 lines, was derived from a cross between Micro-Tom and Regina. Genomic DNAs were isolated from leaves of each line using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and quantitated using a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).2.3. ddRAD-Seq analysisA total of 250 ng of genomic DNA for each line was double digested with SalI and PstI, PstI and EcoRI, EcoRI and HindIII, or PstI and MspI (FastDigest restriction enzymes; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA); ligated to adapters (Table 1) using the LigaFast Rapid DNA Ligation System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA); and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) to eliminate short (<300 bp) DNA fragments. Purified DNA was diluted with H2O and amplified by PCR with indexed primers (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The PCR mixture (50 µl) contained 0.4 ng of DNA, 0.2 µM of each indexed primer (one pair per mixture), 1× PCR buffer for KOD –plus– Ver. 2 (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), 160 µM dNTPs, 1 mM MgSO4, and 1 U DNA polymerase (KOD –plus–; Toyobo). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: a 3 min initial denaturation at 95°C; 20 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94°C, 30 s of annealing at 55°C, and a 60 s extension at 72°C; and a final 3 min extension at 72°C. Amplicons were pooled and separated on a BluePippin 1.5% agarose cassette (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA), and fragments of 300–900 bp were purified using the QIAGEN Mini Elute Kit (Qiagen). Concentrations of the resultant libraries were measured using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) on an ABI-7900HT real-time PCR system (Life Technologies). Nucleotide sequences of the libraries were determined on a MiSeq (Illumina) in paired-end, 250 bp mode. Sequences of oligonucleotides used in ddRAD-SeqaIndex bases are indicated by X, which sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Sequences of oligonucleotides used in ddRAD-SeqaIndex bases are indicated by X, which sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.4. Computational processing for data from empirical ddRAD-Seq analysisIn ddRAD-Seq data analysis as well as WGS ( Processing data for whole-genome sequence of tomato), low-quality sequences were removed and adapters were trimmed using PRINSEQ (-trim_right 1 -trim_qual_right 10 -min_len 100 -derep) and fastx_clipper (-a AGATCGGAAGAGC -l 100 -M 10 -n) in FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit; version 0.10.1). The filtered reads, or subsets of the reads randomly selected using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk), were mapped onto the reference sequences of either contigs generated by assembly of the filtered reads using Newbler (version 3.0; parameters: off for extend low depth overlap; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) or the tomato genome sequence (SL2.50) using Bowtie 2 (version 2.1.0; parameters: --minins 100 --no-mixed).17 The resultant sequence alignment/map format (SAM) files were converted to binary sequence alignment/map format files and subjected to SNP calling using the mpileup option of SAMtools (version 0.1.19; parameters: -Duf)19 and the view option of BCFtools (parameters: -vcg). Lengths of genome regions covered with more than one read at least were calculated with genomeCoverage option of BEDtools (version 2.17.0; parameters: -d).20 Furthermore, variant call format (VCF) files were filtered with VCFtools (version 0.1.11; parameters: --minQ 10 --minDP 4 for the cultivars' data, or --minQ 10 --minDP 4 --max-missing 0.2 --remove-indels for the RMF2 data).21 Missing data were imputed using Beagle4.22 The locations of SNPs in genic and intergenic regions were predicted using SnpEff (version 4.0e; parameters: -v SL2.50, -no-downstream and -no-upstream),23 and those in repetitive sequences and non-repetitive were classified in accordance with the annotation by International Tomato Annotation Group (ITAG2.4_repeats.gff3 available from Sol Genomics Network; https://www.sgn.cornell.edu). Similarity searches of marker-associated sequences against the SL2.50 tomato genome sequence were carried out using BlastN with default parameters.242.5. Linkage analysis and construction of genetic linkage mapsLinkage analysis was carried out with the imputed SNP dataset for RMF2. The segregated data were classified into groups using the grouping module of JoinMap425 with LOD scores of 3–6. The marker order and relative map distances were calculated using the regression-mapping algorithm with the following parameters: Haldane's mapping function, recombination frequency =0.35, and LOD score =2.0. The graphical maps were drawn using the MapChart program.263. Results3.1. Establishment of a genome-wide SNP datasetWGS data for Micro-Tom16 and Regina15 were used to generate a genome-wide SNP dataset by mapping the reads onto the tomato reference sequence, version SL2.50,14,27 as described in Materials and Methods. Mapping rate and fraction of aligned regions of the SL2.50 were 97.9 and 99.2%, respectively, in Micro-Tom, while those were 61.1 and 98.8%, respectively, in Regina. A total of 1,187,941 high-quality SNPs between the two lines were discovered by filtering with the following parameters (Supplementary Table S2): SNP quality, >10, and depth of coverage, =4. The SNP loci were unevenly distributed over the genome, with numbers ranging from 10,170 SNPs on chromosome 6 (chromosome length of 49.8 Mb in total) to 277,708 SNPs on chromosome 4 (66.5 Mb in total) (Supplementary Table S2). Only 13.5 and 39.1% of the 1,187,941 SNPs were found on genic regions and non-repeat sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S2), respectively, both of which are biologically important sequences in the genome (see Distribution of SNPs in genic/intergenic regions and repeat/non-repeat sequences for details).3.2. In silico restriction digestion to determine optimal restriction enzymesTo identify the optimal restriction enzymes for experimental ddRAD-Seq analysis, we performed in silico restriction digestion. For this analysis, we selected five enzymes (SalI, PstI, EcoRI, HindIII, and MspI) with different frequencies of recognition sites in the tomato genome, low in SalI and PstI, middle in EcoRI and HindIII, and high in MspI (Fig. 1A). Four combinations of the enzymes (a combination of low and low: SalI/PstI; low and middle: PstI/EcoRI; middle and middle: EcoRI/HindIII; and middle and high: PstI/MspI) were used for in silico digestion of the genome sequence. The numbers of fragments with 300–900 bases, our target for experimental ddRAD-Seq experiment, covered the entire tomato genome evenly (Supplementary Fig. S2), but varied from 5,082 for SalI/PstI to 65,104 for EcoRI/HindIII (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S2). The distributions of SNPs on each chromosome corresponded to those obtained from WGS data, although the total numbers of the SNPs decreased drastically, to only 3,553 (0.3%) for SalI/PstI and 47,768 (4.0%) for EcoRI/HindIII (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S2). While proportions of SNPs on genic regions to the detected SNPs were ranging from 16.3% (EcoRI/HindIII) to 29.0% (PstI/EcoRI), those of SNPs in non-repeat sequences to whole genome were from 26.7% (SalI/PstI) to 45.0% (PstI/EcoRI) (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S2). The in silico analysis was applied to other plant species, e.g. A. thaliana, L. japonicus, and O. sativa. The result indicated that the tendency was similar to those of A. thaliana and L. japonicus except for O. sativa in which number of PstI/MspI fragments were predominant (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Establishment of data processing pipeline for ddRAD-SeqA data processing pipeline for SNP discovery was established using actual MiSeq reads of Micro-Tom and Regina ddRAD-Seq libraries generated using the PstI/MspI combination (PM libraries). Briefly, sequence reads were processed by removing low-quality reads and trimming adapters, and then mapped onto the reference sequence to detect SNP candidates (see Materials and Methods for details). When 1.9 and 2.2 M paired-reads for Micro-Tom and Regina, respectively, were analysed using this pipeline, 1.2 and 1.4 M high-quality reads were obtained, and 83,011 SNP candidates, including 20,689 homozygous and 62,322 loci with genotypes called as ‘heterozygous’, were detected prior to filtering. Because the two lines are inbred, the ‘heterozygous’ SNPs were excluded because they were likely to reflect sequencing or alignment errors. Of the 20,689 homozygous SNPs, 19,969 SNPs with quality values >10 were selected as high-confidence SNP loci. Out of them, 15,746 SNPs (78.9%) were identical to those from WGS data, whereas the remaining 4,223 SNPs (22.1%) were not found due to sites of insufficient read coverage in the WGS data.3.4. Experimental validation of SNP candidates detected by in silico analysisTo validate the accuracy of the in silico predictions that the numbers of SNPs detected in ddRAD-Seq would be depending on choice of restriction enzymes, additional MiSeq reads were obtained from Micro-Tom and Regina ddRAD-Seq libraries generated using three more restriction enzyme combinations, SalI/PstI (SP), PstI/EcoRI (PE), and EcoRI/HindIII (EH) as well as PM as above. After removal of low-quality sequences and trimming of adapters, a subset of 100k to 900k high-quality paired-end reads were generated for all four libraries. Each subset was mapped onto the reference genome sequence, SL2.50, and high-quality SNP candidates were selected by filtering using the criteria described above. As expected, the number of SNPs in each dataset increased as the number of reads increased (Fig. 2A). However, this tendency differed considerably among the enzyme combinations. The number of SNPs of PM increased linearly up to ~8,000 when 900k reads were used, whereas that of EH gradually reached ~20,000. In contrast, despite their higher numbers of reads, the PE and SP libraries had far fewer SNPs: 4,000 for PE and <100 for SP. As in the in silico prediction, the EH and PM libraries gave much more SNPs than the PE and SP. Number of SNPs detected from empirical ddRAD-Seq analysis.

Distribution of SNPs in genic/intergenic regions and repeat/non-repeat sequencesSince SNPs in genes and non-repetitive sequences are biologically meaningful in comparison with those in intergenic and repetitive regions. Not only proportions of genic and intergenic SNPs detected in the empirical ddRAD-Seq but also those of unique and repeat sequences in the tomato genome were investigated. The result indicated remarkable differences of the proportions among the restriction enzyme combinations (Fig. 3A). In the PE libraries, 70.1% of SNPs were derived from genic regions. This rate is much higher than those from the in silico prediction, which suggested that 29.0% of SNPs occurred in genic regions (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, the PM and SP libraries were enriched for genic SNPs. In contrast, the EH library had SNP frequencies comparable with those obtained from the prediction. The proportions of the SNPs in the repeat/unique sequences were also markedly different among the libraries (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S1): SNPs from the SP, PE, and PM libraries were enriched in the unique sequences in comparison with the prediction, while the proportion of the EH library was comparable with the prediction. We concluded that the PM and PE libraries had advantages to detect SNPs in gene regions and non-repetitive sequences in the tomato genome.

The PstI/MspI combination was employed in accordance with the results of the validation test, expecting to gain as many SNPs in genes and unique sequences of the tomato genome as possible. The high-quality sequence data from the six PM libraries were divided into subsets of 100k–900k paired-end reads and mapped onto the reference genome. As expected, the numbers of SNPs with respect to Heinz 1706 (SL2.50) detected by experimental ddRAD-Seq in Regina and Micro-Tom increased linearly up to ~25,000, whereas those in the other four cultivars reached 5,000 or less (Fig. 2B), indicating that SNP density in the genome influenced the detectability of SNPs by ddRAD-Seq. A graphical genotypes based on the result from the ddRAD-Seq with 900k paired-end reads indicated that the distribution of the SNPs was highly biased on the genome as reported in our previous study (Supplementary Fig. S4).14 The SNP densities relative to SL2.40, a previous version of the tomato genome sequence with the same base compositions to the SL2.50,27 were estimated to be one SNP per 651 bp in Regina,15 803 bp in Micro-Tom,16 1,011 bp in M82,15 3,105 bp in Moneymaker,29 4,347 bp in San Marzano,30 and 8,387 bp in Ailsa Craig.15 The percentages of SNPs detected by ddRAD-Seq analysis per genome-wide SNPs by the WGS were almost even in these six lines: 2.0% genome-wide SNPs on average, ranging from 0.5% in M82 to 3.6% in San Marzano, and proportion of the SNPs in gene regions and repeat sequences from the six lines were similar to those from a combination of Micro-Tom and Regina (Fig. 3A and B).3.7. ddRAD-Seq in an F2 mapping population to construct genetic mapsAccuracy of SNP genotypes called from the ddRAD-Seq pipeline was validated by construction of genetic linkage maps. Because miss-called SNPs would be rejected from the maps, mapping rate of SNPs is an indicator of the accuracy.For the same reason as above to obtain as many SNPs as possible from gene and non-repetitive regions, the PstI/MspI was selected as the optimal enzyme combination for library construction for the F2 mapping population (n = 96), RMF2, derived from a cross between Micro-Tom and Regina. Ninety-six libraries of RMF2 with index tags distinguishing each line (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1) were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq, yielding an average of 268k paired-end reads (=134 Mb, 0.14× genome coverage) per line. After removal of low-quality sequences and trimming of adapters, 226k high-quality reads on average in each line were mapped onto SL2.50 along with the reads from the parental lines. Mapping rates of Micro-Tom and Regina were 94.3 and 92.9%, respectively, while that in the F2 population was 91.0% on average. Of 155,992 SNP candidates between the parental lines, 60,512 loci with quality of =10 and depth of <4 were eliminated; furthermore, 89,241 ‘heterozygous’ SNPs, probably resulting from sequencing and/or alignment errors as noted above, were also removed. Ultimately, 6,239 loci were selected. By allowing 20% missing data for each SNP locus across the 96 F2 lines, 1,845 positions (depth of coverage of 13.5 on average) of the 6,239 loci were selected as high-confidence segregating SNPs in the F2 population. Prior to linkage analysis, the missing genotypes were imputed in accordance with genotype data from the parental lines. Subsequently, 528 genetic loci similar to others were eliminated. Of the remaining 1,317 non-redundant SNP loci, 1,297 (98.5%) were classified into 13 groups, each of which corresponded to one tomato chromosome (with the exception of chromosome 10, which was represented by two groups). Linkage analysis generated a genetic map consisting of 13 linkage groups, with 1,257 loci (95.4%) covering a total of 1,693.2 cM (Table 2 and Fig. 4). The distributions of mapped loci were biased both inter- and intra-chromosomally, reflecting the biases in genome-wide SNP distributions. The order of the mapped loci were consistent with their physical positions in SL2.50 (Fig. 4).

Bars between the two maps indicate the physical map of the tomato genome. The density of SNPs detected using WGS data for the two cultivars is indicated by the darkness of green lines. Loci that are identical between the genetic and physical maps are connected by lines.Next, we investigated the accuracy of SNP calling without a reference genome sequence. The experimental ddRAD-Seq reads of the parental lines were assembled de novo into 44,764 contigs with a total length of 12,443,360 bases, and the high-quality ddRAD-Seq reads for the parents and the 96 F2 lines were subsequently aligned onto the contigs with mapping rates of 65.0% in Micro-Tom, 62.8% in Regina, and 59.0% in the F2 population. The genome positions of the marker loci on the tomato genome were determined by sequence similarity searches against the SL2.50 sequences. Using the same filtering process described above, a total of 1,017 high-confidence SNPs were selected between the parents, and 781 were identified as non-redundant SNP loci in RMF2. Linkage analysis of the 781 SNPs generated a genetic map comprising 14 linkage groups (Table 2 and Fig. 4), each of which corresponded to one tomato chromosome (except for chromosomes 10 and 11, which were represented by two groups apiece). The resultant map consisted of 686 SNP loci (87.8%) covering a total of 1,691.8 cM, and the order of the loci were consistent with their physical positions in the reference genome (Fig. 4). As for the SNPs identified on SL2.50, the distributions of mapped loci were highly biased both between chromosomes and within individual chromosomes. The two mapping studies indicated that the accuracy of SNPs from our ddRAD-Seq pipeline was ~90% or more.4. DiscussionWe propose an analytic workflow for the ddRAD-Seq procedure (Fig. 5). During the establishment experimental and computational data processing pipelines, we found that the prediction of SNP detectability in ddRAD-Seq facilitated optimization of experimental conditions, e.g. choices of enzymes and the density of SNPs in the genome. Although all libraries contained the same amount of sequence data, the numbers of SNPs detected by experimental ddRAD-Seq varied depending on both the combination of restriction enzymes and the density of SNPs in the genome (Fig. 2A and B). In silico prediction should be also useful for optimizing experimental conditions in other plant species for which reference genome sequences and sequencing data are available. On the other hand, in plant species for which less genomic information has accumulated, small-scale pilot experiments with several combinations of restriction enzymes should be performed to determine the optimal enzymes for ddRAD-Seq experiment. The ddRAD-Seq analytical workflow based on empirical and in silico optimization.The ddRAD-Seq analytical workflow based on empirical and in silico optimization.Gene-associated SNPs located on non-repetitive sequences would be biologically meaningful, being beneficial for functional genomics, molecular genetics, and marker-assisted selection in breeding. Interestingly, the rate of gene SNPs detected by the empirical ddRAD-Seq was higher than the predicted rate when PstI was employed for library construction, e.g. PE, PM, and SP libraries (Fig. 3A, B and Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, this point as well as the number of SNPs should be considered to select optimum restriction enzymes. It seems likely that the strong enrichment of euchromatic genes in the libraries is correlated to the methylation sensitivity of restriction enzymes.5 Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing analysis would be helpful to verify this hypothesis.Genome complexity, i.e. ploidy and zygosity, is another important factor that influences the choice of restriction enzymes. For inbred lines and haploids without any heterozygous loci, SNP loci can in principle be correctly genotyped with coverage of at least one high-quality read. In such cases, to obtain as many SNPs as possible, a combination of enzymes should be selected that yields SNP numbers that increase linearly with the number of sequence reads (EH library in Fig. 2A). In contrast, plants with highly heterozygous genomes, e.g. hybrid and polyploid lines, require deep read coverage for accurate SNP detection. Therefore, to distinguish homo- and heterozygous genotypes (or, for polyploids, homologous and homoeologous genotypes), an enzyme combination should be selected that yields a gradually increasing number of SNPs (PE library in Fig. 2A).Reference sequences are essential for SNP detection, but they remain unavailable for many plant species. In the absence of a reference sequence, de novo assembly of actual ddRAD-Seq reads should be used as a reference. To simulate this situation, we performed de novo assembly of the ddRAD-Seq reads generated in this study. The numbers of high-quality SNP loci, non-redundant segregated data, and SNPs located on genetic maps based on the de novo assemblies were ~50% of those based on the SL2.50 reference (Table 2). However, the total lengths of the resultant genetic maps were almost identical, indicating that both genetic maps were saturated. These results indicate that de novo assembly of the ddRAD-Seq reads is sufficient to establish saturated genetic maps. Alternatively, considering recent advances in NGS technologies, whole-genome sequence data from close relatives of a target species might be available,13 and it is generally also possible to generate WGS of the target species itself.The numbers of SNPs detected by ddRAD-Seq varied depending on SNP density in the genome (Fig. 2B). In other words, SNP density is a key factor influencing SNP detectability by ddRAD-Seq. Unfortunately, a strong bias in distribution of SNPs over the genome was observed between Micro-Tom and Regina (Fig. 4 and Table 2), the resultant genetic map with large gaps failed to cover the entire genome. Therefore, either the in silico ddRAD-Seq analysis or small-scale experiments with several combinations of restriction enzymes are recommended to predict SNP availability from actual large-scale ddRAD-Seq analysis before generating mapping populations. However, if this is impossible, increasing the variety of sequencing libraries is another possible way to increase the numbers of SNPs. For instance, although 0.3% (SP) to 4.6% (EH) of SNPs in the genome were theoretically detectable using a single sequencing library, this fraction reached a maximum of 7.6% when four libraries (SP, PE, EH, and PM) were analysed simultaneously. For plants with ultra-low SNP density in the genomes from which few SNPs are expected, alternatively, the SNP chip technologies and/or target capture or target amplicon sequencing technology,31 which tags SNPs regardless of their distances from restriction sites, might be useful; however, this approach would be more costly than ddRAD-Seq. Therefore, prediction of the expected number of SNPs based on SNP density throughout the genome would be helpful to maximize the efficiency of ddRAD-Seq analysis.In conclusion, the ddRAD-Seq technology has the potential to simultaneously genotype SNPs throughout the genome in multiple samples.5,6,8,10 The ddRAD-Seq analytical workflow and the pipeline for the data processing developed in this study (Fig. 5), including the empirical and in silico optimization processes, could be used to advance genetics, genomics, and molecular breeding in both model and non-model plant species, including crops.5.

IntroductionEukaryotic genes and their regulatory elements communicate with each other through a complex wiring of long-range interactions.1 It is now well established that distal enhancers can physically juxtapose to their cognate promoters for transcriptional regulation.2–8 Interestingly, distant genes can also co-localize in nuclear space.9,10 The prevailing view is that the genes spatially cluster at concentrated foci of RNA polymerase II, also known as transcription factories.11–16 It is suggested that the spatial convergence of genes at transcription factories provide a topological basis of co-expression of engaged genes; however, such proposals have not been subjected to proper scrutiny. Recent advent of high throughput derivatives of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) has availed genome-wide quantitative data of long-range chromatin interactions across diverse spectra of model systems.17–26 Briefly, in 3C-derived techniques, the chromatin is cross-linked with formaldehyde, restriction digested, and the open ends of cross-linked products are ligated in diluted conditions to prefer intra-molecular ligation over inter-molecular. In HiC, the ligated junctions are then pulled down and sequenced using deep sequencing to unravel all-to-all chromatin interactions.21 HiC has revealed large topologically associated domains (TADs) that exhibit high density of intra-connectivity of chromatin and are largely conserved across cell lineages.27,28 TADs are tightly associated with the chromatin type and replication timing, and are marked by CTCF on boundaries.27,29,30 Wide-spread enhancer-to-promoter interactions, that are mostly cell-type specific, have been uncovered across several systems.28,31–33 Zhang et al.31 have suggested differential usage of enhancers during embryonic stem cell differentiation. Some studies have also revealed promoter-to-terminator interactions commonly found for housekeeping genes,34 possibly ascribing a circular template for recurrent transcription. Most interesting of all is the widespread promoter-to-promoter interactions among genes impinging from neighbouring regions to form discrete multi-gene complexes.34,35 However, what functional and evolutionary constraints might have shaped the large-scale organization of promoter–promoter interactions is not entirely clear. Although the genes within multi-gene complexes are shown to be co-expressed,34,36 whether or not co-expression of engaged genes is dependent on their spatial, but not the linear, proximity remains to be seen. Moreover, it is hypothesized that interacting promoters can influence transcriptional states of each other and that the promoter of one gene can function as an enhancer of other gene.34 Nevertheless, these proposals are yet not established as fact. Importantly, most of these studies have primarily focussed on intra-chromosomal (referred as ‘cis’ in this study) interactions and whether or not distant genes converging from different chromosomes (referred as trans interactions) have functional association is yet not clear. Comprehensive statistical analyses of accumulated HiC like datasets can answer several questions pertaining to non-random genome organization. Here, we ask whether we can delineate evolutionary constraints of three-dimensional organization of genome.Multivariate analyses provide a statistical platform to assess the association of several different functional variables in an unbiased manner. Availability of various genome-wide datasets and high-resolution data of cis as well as trans chromatin interactions makes budding yeast an ideal candidate for multivariate analysis to identify the potential functional constraints shaping the non-random spatial organization of genome. The article by Duan et al.22 suggested following key features of three-dimensional organization of budding yeast genome: (i) interactions among the centromeres, (ii) interactions among the sites of early origin and not the late origins, and (iii) interactions among t-RNA genes. A few follow-up studies suggested a link between chromatin interactions and co-expression of involved genes.37,38 Another report, on the contrary, dismissed the claims of proximity of co-expressed genes in yeast.39 Moreover, the possibility that cis and trans chromatin interactions might have been shaped under different evolutionary constraints has not been explored. In this study, using comprehensive statistical analysis, we show that functional and evolutionary constraints of cis and trans interactions are significantly distinct and are not necessarily associated with co-expression of genes. We show that the trans interactions are primarily constrained by coordinated replication through converged early origins, while cis interactions are shaped by coordination through late origins and by the minimization of expression noise of engaged genes in an evolutionarily conserved manner.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data sourcesWe obtained the publicly available genome-scale datasets from different sources; details of which are given in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. MethodsDetailed methodology to process the datasets is given in the Supplementary Material.The interaction frequency data (frq) were clustered into bins of equal size of 1 unit, and average value of each functional attribute was calculated for each bin. The master tables for the binned and the original data are given in the Supplementary Information.Correlograms were plotted for the binned data using ‘corrgram’ R-package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrgram/index.html). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated using cor.test() function in R and P-values for multiple comparisons (no. 55) were corrected using Bonferroni's method. Significant P-values after correction are marked with triple asterisk (***) in correlograms.‘PLS’ R-package was used for this (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pls/index.html). Prior to multivariate regression analyses, the columns of X were Z-normalized.We mapped the feature coordinates onto restriction fragments and considered a restriction fragment only once regardless of how many feature coordinates fall inside. This takes care of local clustering of feature coordinates.3. Results3.1. Distinct functional attributes of cis and trans chromatin interactions in yeastChromatin in the interphase nucleus is generally present in the form of chromosomal territories. The chromatin loci embedded inside the territory would, therefore, be expected to have greater number of cis interactions, while the ones near territorial edge would have abundant trans interactions. This is particularly true for the metazoan genomes; the distinction into such intra- and inter-territorial organization of genes is not well studied in yeast however. If yeast genome conforms into distinct territories, certain regions of chromosomes would exhibit greater number of either cis or trans interactions marking intra-territorial and inter-territorial locations of the loci. Therefore, we first tested whether the number of cis interactions of each locus correlated with the trans interactions of corresponding locus in the yeast genome. We smoothened the number of cis and trans interactions using an arbitrary window of 20 kb along the chromosomes and plotted number of cis vs. trans interactions. We observed that the number of cis and trans interactions per locus poorly correlated with each other (<U+03C1>=0.05) and that there were regions, which were enriched either with cis or trans interactions (highlighted in ellipses in Fig. 1a). The observed distinction of cis and trans interactions was also confirmed by plotting the Z-normalized number of cis and trans interactions side-by-side as a function of chromosomal coordinates. As shown in the Fig. 1b, there were domains in the genome having greater number of either cis or trans chromatin interactions. We further calculated average frequency of all the cis and all the trans interactions of each genomic locus independently. By plotting average cis and trans interaction frequencies of corresponding genomic loci against each other, we once again observed regions having higher cis interaction frequency and relatively lower trans frequency and vice versa supporting that there were regions in the genome having high frequency of either cis or trans interactions (Supplementary Fig. S1). We further showed an example of chromosome 4 in the rendered 3D model of yeast genome (as provided by Duan et al.) in Fig. 1c, highlighting a region enriched with local clusters of abundant cis interactions (dashed box). Rest of the chromosome 4 could be seen as an extended arm extensively intermingling with other chromosomes. Quantitative data for Fig. 1c were shown in the Fig. 1d. The plot clearly showed greater number of cis interactions in the boxed area, which corresponds to the same boxed area as in 3D model. Our observations through Fig. 1 highlighted that certain genomic domains can have preferred folding in cis while others intermingles extensively with other chromosomes in trans, supporting the notion of ‘chromosome territories’. This also raised a possibility of cis and trans interactomes to have evolved under distinct evolutionary constraints. We, therefore, attempted to delineate the functional attributes that explained best the observed distinction of cis and trans chromatin interactions by analysing the datasets of cis and trans chromatin interactions independently.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Multi-dimensional genomic datasets, i.e. data where measurements were done for all the yeast genes across several different time-points or conditions, were used to calculate similarity (mostly Pearson's correlation coefficient; Fig. 2; Table 1; Materials and Methods) between interacting genes. Analysis of correlations among several functional attributes suggested that the frequency of trans interactions was best correlated with the similarity in % replicated DNA or co-replication (‘rep’, Table 1) of interacting loci (<U+03C1>=0.47, P-value < 10-4, Fig. 3a). Interestingly, co-expression of genes (i) through cell cycle (cct), (ii) following transcription factor perturbation (tfp), and (iii) following environmental perturbations did not show strong correlation with the trans interaction frequency as claimed elsewhere38 (<U+03C1>=0.07, 0.09, and 0.13, respectively; Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. S2). On the contrary, cis interactions among loci, which were at least 20 kb apart, did not exhibit strong correlation with co-replication (<U+03C1>= 0.14; P-value < 10-3; FDR > 0.01) and were, instead, strongly correlated with the co-fitness of interacting genes as measured through chemical genomic screens (<U+03C1>= 0.25; P-value < 10-4; FDR < 0.01; Fig. 3b). Again, the general cell-cycle-related co-expression of genes showed weak correlation, though slightly higher compared with the trans interactions (<U+03C1> = 0.11 vs. 0.07). To further scrutinize the significance of observed correlations, we rewired the chromatin interactions using the strategy given in the ‘Materials and methods’ section to obtain null distribution and calculate P-values (Supplementary Fig. S3). Examples of correlograms generated from rewired cis and trans interactions were shown in Supplementary Fig. S3a and b, and their comparisons with observed values of correlations were drawn in Supplementary Fig. S3c and d. In particular, we confirmed that (i) the correlation of trans interaction frequency with the coordinated replication and that of cis interaction frequency with the co-fitness of interacting genes were (i) significant compared with rewired control (P-value = 1.0e–09 and 3.3e–09, respectively, FDR < 0.001 for both comparisons, Supplementary Fig. S3a–e); and (ii) significantly different for cis and trans interactions, i.e. correlation with ‘rep’ was significantly higher for trans (P-value = 3.1e–12) and lower for cis, while correlation with co-fitness was significantly higher for cis (P-value = 8.5e–08) and lower for trans interactions. We also confirmed these observations for the chromatin interactions that were concomitantly captured in the HiC-library generated using EcoRI restriction enzyme, highlighting the robustness of the analyses (Supplementary Fig. S4a and b). We further cross-validated the differential association of cis and trans interaction frequencies with the coordinated replication (rep) and co-fitness (cof) of engaged genes using recently published HiC dataset of exponentially growing budding yeast cells40 (Fig. 3c).

Loading vectors p1 and p2 correspond to leading latent vectors t1 and t2 of matrix T, which explain 32.3 and 5.6% variance of Y (n× 1 matrix of interaction frequency) for trans interactions and 36.9 and 3.96% variance of cis interaction frequency, respectively. The datasets plotted in a and b are given in the Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. The loadings for all the components are given in the Supplementary Fig. S5. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Correlation analysis does not always imply if a variable independently accounts for the observed response (interaction frequency in this case) or it is due to co-linearity among variables. To address this, we performed PLSR of the variables to identify the ones that explained the observed variance in the frequency of chromatin interactions. The analyses suggested that 32.3 and 36.9% of total variance in trans and cis interaction data, respectively, were explained by one major component, primarily comprised of co-replication (rep) followed by similar susceptibility to chromatin factor perturbations (cfp) of interacting genes in case of trans interactions and co-fitness (cof) followed by functional similarity (fsm) of interacting genes in case of cis interactions (Fig. 3d and e). The second best component explained only 5.6 and 3.9% of variance in trans and cis interaction frequency, respectively. Details of relative contributions of functional attributes to each component were given in the Supplementary Fig. S5. Importantly, second component was also associated with co-replication to a large extent (second best contributor) in case of trans interactions and with co-fitness (second best contributor) in case of cis interactions (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, the cell-cycle-related co-expression (cct) of genes, in general, did not show significant contributions to the first two components in PLSR analysis of either trans or cis interactions. Overall, the PLSR and the correlation analyses concomitantly suggested that the trans interactions in yeast were primarily shaped by similarity in replication states of interacting loci, while cis interactions were mainly constrained by co-fitness of interacting genes highlighting an overall distinction of constraints shaping cis and trans chromatin interactomes.3.2. trans and cis interactions associate with the coordination of early and late replication, respectivelyIt has been shown that the early firing, but not the late firing, origins from different chromosomes non-randomly collide with each other in the nuclear space.22 We first confirmed this observation (P-value = 3.1e–02, Fig. 4a). Interestingly, we observed that the late, but not the early, firing origins non-randomly interacted in cis (P-value = 1.9e–02; Fig. 4a), suggesting that the close physical proximity might be a common property of origins of replication and that early origins were trans interacting and late origins were cis interacting. Early and late origins showed significantly lesser number of cis and trans interactions with each other compared with null distribution, i.e. early-to-late interactions were under-represented compared with null distribution, strongly suggesting that they do not interact with each other in cis or trans (P-valuecis = 0.003, P-valuetrans = 0.012; Supplementary Fig. S6). It is noteworthy that the significant P-values in the Fig. 4a did not approach extreme partly due to small sample sizes (n = 78 and 122 for early and late origins) and stringent null models. Association of cis and trans chromatin interactions with the coordinated replication and co-varying mutation rate.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.These observations suggested that the correlation between trans interaction frequency and correlated replication seen in Fig. 2a might be associated with the non-random trans interactions among early origins. On similar lines, relatively weaker correlation (<U+03C1>=0.14) of cis interaction frequency with the coordinated replication might be associated with the non-random cis interactions among late origins (Fig. 3b). To further explore whether trans and cis interactions associate with the coordination of early and late replication, respectively, we split the yeast genome into early and late replicating domains as per data from McCune et al.41 and accordingly compiled early-to-early and late-to-late interaction categories. Early-to-early (EE) interaction category exhibited significant correlation between coordinated replication and the trans, but not the cis, interaction frequency (<U+03C1>trans = 0.37, <U+03C1>cis = 0.0; Fig. 4b). On the contrary, in the late-to-late category, cis and trans interactions showed marginally differing correlations with coordinated replication (<U+03C1>cis = 0.26, <U+03C1>trans = 0.29; Fig. 4b). However, importantly, the cis interaction frequency in the late-to-late category showed greater significance and power of correlation with the coordinated replication compared with the trans interaction frequency (P-valuecis = 8.7 × 10-8, P-valuetrans = 2.7 × 10-4; powercis = 0.99 and powertrans = 0.83; Fig. 4b). Since the Pearson's correlation coefficient decreases and the power of the observed effect increases exponentially as the sample size increases, we reason that the differing sample sizes of cis and trans interactions of late replicating regions (n = 711 and 146 binned values, respectively) explain the observed difference in significance of apparently similar correlation values. It is also notable that the cis interactions, as a whole, were only weakly associated with the coordinated replication as demonstrated in Fig. 3b, the significance of correlation of late replication with the cis interactions was, therefore, non-trivial. This is also reinforced by our earlier observation that late origins interacted in cis, but not in trans. These results supported that the trans and cis interactions were organized vis-a-vis to correlated early and late replication states, respectively, possibly marking spatial segregation of early and late replication factories. Furthermore, replication is the major cause of mutations in the genome, and correlation between replication timing and mutation rates has been observed in the past.42 We, therefore, asked whether spatially proximal loci exhibited similar mutation rates. We obtained synonymous single-nucleotide substitution rates, which were adjusted for neutrality, for this purpose (Supplementary Table S1). Again, we observed stronger correlation between similarity in mutation rates and the trans interaction frequency and relatively weaker correlation with the cis interaction frequency (<U+03C1>cis = 0.14, <U+03C1>trans = 0.36; P-valuecis = 0.63, P-valuetrans = 2.2e–05; Supplementary Fig. S7). Early-to-early interactions in trans and late-to-late interactions in cis exhibited greater significance of correlations with the similarity in mutation rates of engaged genes (P-valueEE,cis = 0.15, P-valueEE,trans = 1.4e–03, P-valueLL,cis = 5.4e–02, P-valueLL,trans = 0.46; Fig. 4b), highlighting a possible role of 3D genome organization in mutagenic mechanisms that might have shaped the co-evolution of spatially proximal genes in yeast. We hypothesize that the genes sharing the same sub-nuclear compartment might experience similar microenvironment that causes single-nucleotide mutations during replication or similar deficiency/efficiency of DNA repair factors.3.3. trans and cis interactions exhibit differential preference for nucleosome occupancySince the process of replication is intricately linked with the chromatin structure, we tested whether the observed distinction between trans and cis interactomes was associated with nucleosome occupancy and explains their association with early and late replication, respectively. Z-normalized nucleosome occupancy in 3 kb bins across yeast genome was plotted against the number of cis, trans interactions, and the ratio of the two. The plots clearly showed significantly negative and positive correlations with cis and trans interactions, respectively (<U+03C1>cis = -0.12, <U+03C1>trans = 0.13; P-valuecis < 2.2e–16, P-valuetrans < 2.2e–16; Fig. 5a). Accordingly, the ratio of number of cis and trans interactions inversely scaled with the nucleosome occupancy suggesting that cis and trans interactions, in general, associate with low and high nucleosome occupancy, respectively (<U+03C1>cis/trans = -0.10; P-valuecis/trans = 7.2e–08; Fig. 5a). The Pearson's correlation coefficients observed in the Fig. 5a, though statistically significant, were relatively small in magnitude, which can be attributed to large sample size (n = 4,031). It is also noteworthy that the present study does not aim to claim the scaling of cis and trans interactions with the nucleosome occupancy, but the distinct level of nucleosome occupancy of regions significantly enriched with cis or trans interactions. Therefore, we identified the cis- and trans-rich regions using sliding window (20 kb) approach and applying cut-off for cis/trans peaks as 50% of maximal window value in the genome (Fig. 5b). Demarcating the regions that were enriched with cis- or trans interactions clearly highlighted greater nucleosome occupancy in the regions enriched with trans interactions and vice versa (P-value < 2.2e–16; Fig. 5b, boxplot). These observations suggested that the nucleosome-depleted ‘open chromatin’ regions in the yeast genome were more likely to fold in cis, possibly highlighting a mechanism of spatially insulating the highly transcribing open chromatin from the nucleosome-rich repressive or regulated domains. We indeed observed that cis-enriched, nucleosome-depleted domains had relatively higher transcriptional activity compared with trans-enriched regions (P = 5.0e–03; Fig. 5b, boxplot). We also confirmed that these correlations were not the artefacts of abundant trans interactions among centromeres, which are generally heterochromatized and might show higher nucleosomal occupancy. We removed the regions that were proximal (<50 kb) to centro/telomeres and recalculated the correlations. We consistently found significant negative and positive correlations of nucleosome occupancy with the cis and trans interaction frequencies, respectively (<U+03C1>cis = -0.12, <U+03C1>cis = 0.19; P-valuecis < 2.2e–16, P-valuetrans < 2.2e–16).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To reconcile the observation in the context of replication, we assessed the nucleosome occupancy around the early origins and compared with that of late origins. To nullify the differential levels of replicated DNA at early and late origins during S phase, we considered nucleosome occupancy in G1 phase of cell cycle only. Since we showed that the trans interactions were associated with early origins as well as with higher overall nucleosome occupancy, by inference, we expected the early origins to be associated with the higher nucleosome occupancy and vice versa for late origins. Indeed, we confirmed greater overall nucleosome occupancy around early origins compared with late origins (±10 kb, P-value = 5.0e-02, Fig. 5c). Interestingly, by analysing the nucleosome occupancy at single nucleosome resolution, we observed that the early origins were located in a narrow (~350 bp) nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) despite having an overall higher nucleosome occupancy (Fig. 5c). Such nucleosomal organization had been shown to facilitate the replication initiation.43 Late origins, on the contrary, were located in a relatively wider NDR (~750 bp), significance of which is not entirely clear yet (Fig. 5c). However, we speculated that the late origins might need accessibility to additional sequence features for the regulatory factors involved in late replication. Indeed, such sequence features have been proposed earlier by others too.44,45 Role of cis regulatory elements in late firing of origins is further discussed in the Discussion section.3.4. Association of cis interactions with the essential gene clustersStrong correlation between cis interaction frequency and the co-fitness of interacting genes suggested that the genes with similar fitness defects across different environments tend to co-localize more frequently. This would also mean that genes with the same extreme growth defects, like lethality, would tend to interact with greater interaction frequency. We, therefore, tested whether the essential genes were interacting with each other in cis with a significantly greater frequency compared with random null model. We extracted the cis and trans interactions that had essential genes on both restriction fragments. Indeed, the re-sampling approach uncovered significantly greater frequency of cis (P-value = 5e–02), but not the trans (P-value = 0.16), interactions among essential genes (Fig. 6a). Essential genes are generally located in the regions having an overall low nucleosome occupancy and consequently exhibit lower expression noise.46 We, therefore, propose a hypothesis that the essential genes should also be relatively stable in the three-dimensional nuclear space to keep the expression noise low. Greater mobility might introduce noise in the expression, which can be deleterious in case of essential genes. We presumed that a stable locus would be expected to show: (i) high average value of its interaction frequencies to all its cis-interacting partners, that we referred as ‘average interaction frequency’; (ii) relatively short-range interactions and lower variance in the genomic distances between interacting loci; and (iii) greater consistency of chromatin interactions across biological replicates in HiC experiments, measured as overlap of interactions of a locus commonly captured in EcoRI and HindIII HiC libraries to all its interactions captured in HindIII library. Although it is not possible to distinguish biological variations from technical variations in the present scenario, some studies have shown that variation between biological replicates are largely biological than technical and can be attributed to genetic, epigenetic, or stochastic mosaicism of cells.47–52 The chromatin loci exhibiting greater consistency of chromatin interactions in biological replicates can, therefore, be considered relatively restrained in the nuclear space compared with the ones showing greater variations. By applying the aforementioned measures, we observed that the loci having essential gene clusters (>2 gene in 5 kb bin) consistently showed: (i) higher average interaction frequency (P-value = 3.8e–06; Fig. 6b), (ii) relatively short-range interactions as depicted by mean distance between interacting sites (P-value = 2.9e–02; Fig. 6c); (iii) lower variance in genomic distances between interacting sites (P-value = 3.5e–02; Fig. 6c); and (iv) greater overlap between biological replicates of HiC data, compared with rest of genome (Supplementary Fig. S8). Further, the average interaction frequency decreases as a function of genomic distance from the essential gene clusters, marking the selective enrichment of high frequency interaction on and around essential gene clusters (Fig. 6d and e, Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus, the higher average interaction frequency, relatively short-range interactions of lower variance, and consistency across HiC replicates might suggest spatially clustered and stable nature of genomic regions having essential gene clusters. We also confirmed the link between gene essentiality and the average interaction frequency analysing average fitness defect, as measure from chemical genomics data, at sites of high average interaction frequency (P-value = 9.0e–06; Supplementary Fig. S10).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.5. cis interactions are constrained by minimization of expression noiseTo directly test whether or not spatially restrained loci were associated with the lower noise in the expression, we extracted high noise and low noise genes (upper and lower quartile of genome-wide abundance-corrected expression noise data) and assessed their average interaction frequencies, mean and variance of genomic distances between interacting sites, and the overlap ratio of their interactions captured in the HiC replicates. The genes with low expression noise exhibited greater average interaction frequency (P-value = 2e–02; Fig. 7a), relatively lower mean and variance of genomic distances between interacting loci (P-valuemean = 9e–03, P-valuevariance = 4e–02; Fig. 7b), and greater overlap ratio of interactions in the HiC biological replicates (P-value = 3.3e05; Fig. 7), supporting the hypothesis that spatially restrained loci would tend to have lower expression noise. Indeed, the expression noise of essential genes inversely scaled with the average cis, but not the trans interaction frequency of the loci (Supplementary Fig. S11). Further, it is known that the genes that are toxic when over-expressed also exhibit low expression noise.46 We, therefore, tested whether these genes are also spatially constrained by high frequency of cis interactions. Surprisingly, genes exhibiting over-expression toxicity did not show significantly greater average interaction frequency as in the case of essential gene clusters (Supplementary Fig. S12). We propose that spatially restrained or ‘tethered’ property is specifically associated with the mechanism that minimizes stochastic loss of expression but not the abrupt gain of expression.

Data plotted in a–c and d–g are given in Supplementary Tables S9 and S10, respectively. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To further scrutinize our observations, we performed following additional analyses. (i) We identified the regions of significantly greater average frequency of cis interactions from the interactions commonly present in the two HiC replicates. The distribution plot of average cis interaction frequency across yeast genome revealed a distinct population of regions having significantly greater interaction frequency than the rest (Supplementary Fig. S13a). This is analogous to identifying ‘peaks’ in ChIP-Seq genomic tracks. The ‘peak’ nature of certain regions was also confirmed by plotting QQ plot of the average interaction frequency against a random normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. 13b and c). We extracted the genes located in these regions and compared the expression noise with the null distribution. Again, we observed significantly lower (P-value = 1e–03) noise for the genes located in the regions of high average interaction frequency. (ii) Lower diversity of interactions might also represent relatively stable state of a locus. We measured the variation in chromatin environment using coefficient of variation (s/µ) and observed that the genes having greater variation in their chromatin interactions exhibited higher expression noise (P-value = 3e–02; Supplementary Fig. S14). (iii) More importantly, we compared the experimentally determined chromatin mobility of several loci53,54 with their average cis interaction frequencies, variances of distances between interacting sites, and the expression noise (Fig. 7d–g, Supplementary Fig. S15). The analyses showed striking correlation of chromatin fluctuations with the expression noise (<U+03C1>=0.78, Fig. 7d), moderate correlation with the variance of genomic distances between interacting loci (<U+03C1>=0.39, Fig. 7e), and strong anticorrelation with the cis interaction frequency (<U+03C1>=-0.65, Fig. 7f), strongly supporting our proposal that the chromatin mobility associates with the expression noise of the underlying genes.Although we largely restrict all our claims to the budding yeast genome, we now present a few lines of evidence which suggest that minimization of expression noise through physically restrained environment might be a general evolutionary constraint shaping the genome organization in other radically different systems like bacteria and the mammalian cells. The expression noise data had been available for Escherichia coli too55 and very recently genome organization data of E. coli have also been generated using Genome Conformation Capture technique.56,57 It would, therefore, be interesting to test whether the proposed relationship between interaction frequency and expression noise also exists in Bacteria. We performed similar analyses in E. coli by taking normalized interaction frequency data for 10 kb bins as provided by Xie et al.,56 number of essential genes and the maximal expression noise value in each bin. We found strikingly similar association among gene essentiality, expression noise, and average interaction frequency in E. coli, as in yeast (Fig. 8a–c). This is an important observation highlighting an evolutionarily conserved association between expression noise and genome organization despite having radically distinct mechanisms of gene expression. Further, genome-wide single-cell gene expression data are now available for several model systems. We obtained one such dataset for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), for which genome-wide chromatin interaction data was also available.35,58 We calculated the noise in gene expression for mESCs and corrected for the transcript abundance using residuals of lowess fit between transcript abundance and noise. Again, the average interaction frequency of low noise genes was significantly greater than that of high noise genes (P-value = 3.0e–11; Fig. 8d). Due to lack of whole-genome single-cell gene expression data along with HiC data on other cell types of mammalian genome, our observation on mESCs is presently not generalizable to different cell types in higher eukaryotes.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The above analyses clearly strengthened our proposal that essential genes exhibit lesser variation in its chromatin environment and that such a property contributes in reducing the expression noise of engaged loci.4. DiscussionIt is known that spatial positioning of genes in the nucleus is highly non-random. Genes positioned interior to the nucleus experience transcriptionally permissive environment, while the ones located near the nuclear periphery are generally repressed or lowly expressed.1 Whether or not spatial co-localization of genes plays an active role in regulating essential genomic functions is presently subjected to intense scrutiny. It has been presumed that genes co-localize to synchronize their transcriptional states.59,60 Besides sporadic reports of co-expression of individual loci,19,61,62 genome-wide proposal has been made in case of multi-gene complexes (relatively short-range intra-chromosomal interactions) in mammals34 and for both intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions in lower eukaryotes like yeast.37,38 However, these studies are not subjected to comprehensive multivariate analyses and in the absence of other genomic variables, these reports do not present an unbiased view of possible functional constraints shaping the three-dimensional genome organization of eukaryotic genome. Here we analysed several functional attributes of yeast genome to identify the potential constraints of genome-wide chromatin interactions. Our analyses suggested that inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions were under distinct evolutionary constraints. While inter-chromosomal interactions were primarily associated with the coordination of Clb5-independent replication, intra-chromosomal interactions were constrained by the coordination of Clb5-dependent replication and minimization of expression noise of engaged loci. Correlation of interaction frequency with the co-expression of engaged genes was very weak. The correlation coefficient of similar magnitude was also reported earlier by others.37 However, the authors compared the correlation coefficient with the average correlation of all possible gene pairs in the genome and found the correlation of 0.09 to be significantly higher. We argue that genome-wide average might not serve as an appropriate control, because the sample size of gene pairs will be disproportionally greater for the whole genome compared with the ones that are spatially proximal. Rewired contact networks and re-sampling-based approach can serve as better control. Re-assessment of reports claiming co-localization of co-regulated genes have been questioned elsewhere too.39 More importantly, in the absence of other functional variables, it is not entirely justified to claim that co-expression if the major constraint of genome organization.The specific association of trans and cis interaction frequency with early and the late replication, respectively, supports the notion of spatially segregated early and late replication factories, which had been proposed earlier by several authors.63–65 Interestingly, a recent report has clearly shown that androgen-induced proximity between TMPRSS2 and ERG genes is due to AR-controlled replication, but not the transcription.66 Further, the association of preferred domains of cis and trans interactions with the low and high nucleosome occupancy, respectively, supports the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin. The observation that the early origins were flanked by well-positioned nucleosome around a narrow trough of nucleosome-depleted region was in line with earlier reports suggesting the role ORC mediated nucleosome positioning in establishment of pre-initiation complex around early origins.43 Relatively wider NDRs around late origins can be explained through following arguments: (i) Late firing of origins might need additional cis regulatory elements in the proximity. It is known that after recycling from early origins, replication factors are present in a very limited amount for late origins. Late origins, therefore, cannot afford the delay caused by the remodelling of nucleosomes to open up the binding sites of replication factors. Constitutively open chromatin and spatial co-localization of late origins therefore might help in efficient and rapid usage of replication factors and ensure the complete replication of the genome. (ii) Late origins are known to be present predominantly in the intergenic regions (IGRs) between convergent genes.67 The abundant occurrence of transcription termination around convergent IGRs can interfere with the nucleosome stability at late origins. The nucleosome depletion around late origins can thus be an artefact of genomic neighbourhood. (iii) It is known that the radial positioning early origins in the nuclear space is mostly random, while late origins often localize towards nuclear periphery. The accessibility to sequences flaking late origins can help targeting the late origins to nuclear periphery.68The association of chromatin interactions with the mutation rate variation suggests a potential role of spatial genome organization in mutagenic mechanisms. Coordinated replication through spatial convergence might also ascribe similar susceptibility to genetic errors at engaged loci. Such properties had earlier been proposed in the context of cancer genomes.69,70Intra-chromosomal interactions, on the other hand, were also constrained by co-fitness of genes. It has been proposed that the gene pairs with higher co-fitness represent their close functional similarity. It can, therefore, partly be explained by the co-functionality of cis-interacting genes as shown in the Fig. 2e. We further attempted to explain the link between fitness defect and genome organization by taking essential genes as example. We hypothesized that the high frequency intra-chromosomal interactions restrict the mobility of engaged loci, while low frequency interactions of a locus might represent a relatively mobile state of chromatin. The presumption that the high interaction frequency and the lower coefficient of variation represent spatially restrained loci in genome is also supported by comparison with the experimentally determined mobility of certain loci54 (Fig. 8d–g, Supplementary Fig. S12). Restricted mobility of interacting loci might be important to reduce the transcriptional noise of interacting genes. We reconciled this hypothesis by taking the example of essential genes. Essential gene clusters are known to exhibit lower expression noise and consistently remain in transcriptionally permissive open chromatin state. Their non-randomly greater frequency of interactions aligns to our hypothesis. It was noteworthy that we did not consider the chromatin interactions between loci which were <20 kb apart, and therefore, the linear clustering of essential genes would not have impacted this observation. Further, the association of low noise genes with greater mean interaction frequency of loci and vice versa across bacteria, yeast, and mouse genomes clearly suggests that spatially stable nature of genes assist in minimizing the stochastic transcriptional errors. Indeed, it has earlier been proposed that the long-range chromatin interactions might occur at the cost of increased expression noise.71 To which sub-nuclear compartment these loci might tether to? We propose that for active genes, the most likely tethering foci would be transcription factories. Though this would need thorough scrutiny, we explored the RNAPII-associated chromatin interaction data generated through ChIA-PET technique for this purpose. Multi-gene complexes in that data have been proposed to be equivalent to transcription factories.34 We asked whether abundance-corrected transcriptional noise associate with these complexes. We observed that the number of RNAPII-tethered promoter-to-promoter interactions, marking multi-gene complexes, was significantly higher for low noise genes compared with high noise genes (P < 3e–11), suggesting that genes engaged in multi-gene complexes or transcription factories tend to have lower transcriptional noise (Fig. 8e). Other nuclear compartments like nucleoli have been shown experimentally to constrain the chromatin movement, and their disruption leads to increased chromatin mobility.72Altogether, our unbiased approach of analysing distinct functional constraints provides a different perspective of evolution of three-dimensional genome organizations, which appears to be conserved in bacteria, yeast, and mouse. Escherichia coli genome is known to have an organization tightly linked with the replication,57 and here we showed that it is also associated with gene essentiality and expression noise, very similar to what we observed in yeast. Finally, based on our observations, we propose a model for functional constraints shaping the cis and trans organization of chromatin. This is illustrated in the Fig. 9. Schematic representation of overall observations. At higher resolution, the yeast genome is organized into preferred domains of inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions, which is associated with the spatial segregation of early and late replication. As inferred from high average interaction frequency and chromatin fluctuations, essential gene loci are hypothesized to be physically restrained possibly by tethering to nuclear sub-compartments or foci. The proposed physically restrained nature of essential genes might be important to mitigate the epigenetic fluctuations or errors that predispose the genes to stochastic variation in expression. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Schematic representation of overall observations.

ConclusionThe study suggests that there are different set of functional constraints that shape intra- and inter-chromosomal interactomes in eukaryotes. Distinct spatial organization of early and late origins and the underlying coordination of replication strongly support the presence of discrete early and late replication factories. A tethered intra-chromosomal microenvironment might ascribe physical stability to a locus which can be important to reduce the transcriptional noise of engaged loci, particularly, the ones that are functionally indispensable. Therefore, coordinated replication and gene essentiality, not necessarily the co-expression of genes, seem major functional and evolutionary constraints shaping the three-dimensional genome organization of eukaryotes as well as of prokaryotes.Authors’ contributionA.S. performed most of the analyses.

To characterize the genetic systems of Zoysia plants and to analyse their structural and functional differences in individual species and accessions, we sequenced the genomes of Zoysia species using HiSeq and MiSeq platforms. As a reference sequence of Zoysia species, we generated a high-quality draft sequence of the genome of Z. japonica accession ‘Nagirizaki’ (334 Mb) in which 59,271 protein-coding genes were predicted. In parallel, draft genome sequences of Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’ were also generated for comparative analyses. To investigate the genetic diversity among the Zoysia species, genome sequence reads of three additional accessions, Z. japonica ‘Kyoto’, Z. japonica ‘Miyagi’ and Z. matrella ‘Chiba Fair Green’, were accumulated, and aligned against the reference genome of ‘Nagirizaki’ along with those from ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’. As a result, we detected 7,424,163 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 852,488 short indels among these species. The information obtained in this study will be valuable for basic studies on zoysiagrass evolution and genetics as well as for the breeding of zoysiagrasses, and is made available in the ‘Zoysia Genome Database’ at http://zoysia.kazusa.or.jp.1. IntroductionMembers of the genus Zoysia are some of the most cold- and salt-tolerant plants among warm-season turfgrasses.1,2 Commonly known as zoysiagrasses, Zoysia species offer good turf qualities, including hardiness, salt tolerance, resistance to drought, shade, and heat, and they are preferred for their aesthetic characteristics. Zoysia comprises 11 species, and all of which are allotetraploids (2n = 4x = 40). Originating from East Asia (Japan, Korea, China), these out-crossing and mat-forming perennial grasses have spread throughout the Pacific Rim and have been used for centuries as cover plants for burial mounds according to the customs in the Orient. Five species such as Z. japonica Steudel, Z. matrella (L.) Merrill, Z. pacifica (Goudswaard) M. Hotta & Kuroki [syn. Z. matrella (L.) Merr. var. pacifica Goudswaard], Z. sinica Hance, and Z. macrostachya Franchet & Savatier have been found in Japan, and they exhibit wide morphological and ecological differences.3Zoysiagrasses have received less attention from the research community than other Poaceae family members. However, several research groups have conducted genetic studies on zoysiagrasses in an attempt to evaluate their genetic variation and clarify their phylogenetic relationships. Studies comparing domestic zoysiagrass accessions and wild species have revealed high rates of introgression and hybridization, particularly among Z. japonica, Z. matrella, and Z. pacifica.4,5 High-density genetic linkage maps have been constructed in many crop species, to promote map-based gene cloning and marker-enhanced breeding. Such maps have been produced for zoysiagrasses based on restriction and amplified fragment length polymorphisms, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and combinations of these markers, and the maps have been used in quantitative trait loci analyses.4,6,7 Moreover, sequence-tagged high-density genetic maps of Z. japonica were constructed and compared with those of Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor, revealing a highly conserved collinearity in the gene order of these genomes.8 In parallel with the construction of genetic maps, transcriptome analyses have been used to identify abiotic stress-related genes9,10 and genes that control tissue-specific anthocyanin pigmentation in Z. japonica.11 A complete sequence of the chloroplast genome of Z. matrella L. Merr has also been published.12Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the acquisition of large sequence datasets from plant nuclear and organelle genomes. These genetic resources offer significant impacts on plant research in all disciplines, including systematics, genetics, co-evolution, conservation genetics, and breeding.13 Whole-genome sequencing along with precise data analysis by means of bioinformatics has allowed the discovery of new genes and regulatory sequences, and can integrate variant types including indels, structural variants and copy number variations.14 Genome and gene sequences have been accumulated for many model and crop plant species. However, much more work is needed to clarify relationships and variations across the Poaceae family, particularly in the subfamily Chloridoideae, which consists of 1,601 species in 131 genera that possess the Kranz or C4 anatomy and chloridoid bicellular microhairs.15 For example, there were only 1,004 sequences from Zoysia spp. found in GenBank at the time of this writing. Here, we report on the generation and comparison of high-quality draft sequences of zoysiagrass genomes derived from native accessions of Z. japonica, Z. matrella and Z. pacifica in Japan. Furthermore, we compared the zoysiagrass genomes with those of related species: O. sativa, S. bicolor, and Brachypodium distachyon.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsSix accessions of three species (Z. japonica, Z. matrella and Z. pacifica) were used in this study. These accessions are maintained at the Kibana Agricultural Science Station, Field Science Center, University of Miyazaki, Japan. An accession of Z. japonica, ‘Nagirizaki’, was collected from Tsushima, Nagasaki. We obtained stolons from ‘Nagirizaki’ plants and cut them into 2–3 cm segments with nodes. The segments were surface sterilized using a standard protocol. The shoot apices were excised from the nodes and cultured on half-strength hormone-free Murashige and Skoog medium16 solidified with 0.7% agar in test tubes for regeneration. The regenerated leaves were used for whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The other accessions were as follows: Z. japonica ‘Miyagi’ from Ishinomaki, Miyagi; Z. japonica ‘Kyoto’ from Kyoto, Kyoto; and Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’, Z. matrella ‘Chiba Fair Green’, and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’ from Yomitan-son, Okinawa. Shoots of these accessions were briefly sterilized in 2% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution followed by three rinses with sterile water, and transplanted into pots (diameter: 6.0 cm, depth: 5.5 cm) filled with sterilized vermiculite and covered with plastic containers. All accessions were incubated at 31°C under 16 h light (30 µmol m-2 s-1) and 8 h dark condition, and their leaves were used for comparative studies.2.2. Flow cytometryFlow cytometry was conducted to estimate the genome sizes of the six Zoysia accessions according to Ishigaki et al.17Sorghum bicolor ‘Tx623’ was used as the internal standard with a DNA content of 1.67 pg 2C-1.18 The fluorescent intensity of each nuclear suspension was measured using an EPICS XL equipped with a 488 nm argon laser and a long path filter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., CA, USA). The analysis was replicated three times for each sample.2.3. Shotgun sequencing of zoysiagrass genomesWhole-genome shotgun sequencing of the Zoysia species was performed using both the HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq platforms (Illumina Inc., CA, USA). Genomic DNA extracted from leaves was used for library construction according to standard protocols. The paired-end (PE) libraries were constructed using the manufacture's protocol (Illumina), and the mate-pair (MP) libraries were constructed using GS Titanium Library Paired End Adaptors (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) as described previously.19 The libraries sequenced and platforms used for each accession are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For sequencing the genomes of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’, Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’, and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’, PE reads with insert sizes of 700 bp were sequenced using the MiSeq platform. For ‘Nagirizaki’, MP reads with insert sizes of 5, 10, and 15 kb were sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 platform. For ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’, MP reads with insert sizes of 3 kb were sequenced using HiSeq 2000. For the other three accessions, such as Z. japonica ‘Kyoto’, Z. japonica ‘Miyagi’, and Z. matrella ‘Chiba Fair Green’, PE reads with insert sizes of 300 bp were sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 platform. The k-mer frequency analysis and estimation of genome sizes were performed using SOAPec, ver. 2.0.1,20 using the PE reads of each accession.2.4. Assembly of genome sequences and RNA-Seq analysisGenome sequence assembly was performed for Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’, Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’, and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’ using the MiSeq PE and HiSeq MP reads. The adaptor sequences in the PE and MP reads were trimmed, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates in the MP reads were excluded. For ‘Nagirizaki’, the MiSeq and HiSeq 2000 reads were assembled into contigs using Platanus, v1.2.1.21 The scaffolding in Platanus was conducted under strict conditions with options –l 5 and –s 72. For ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’, contigs were assembled from the MiSeq PE reads using DISCOVAR de novo ver. 51598 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/discovar/blog/) and FERMI, v1.1.22 After the comparison of the status of resulted contigs by two assemblers, the contig sets generated by DISCOVAR de novo were further assembled with the PE and MP reads to generate scaffolds using Opera, v2.0.23 Gaps in the ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’ scaffolds were filled by a sequential treatment with the two contig sets (the DISCOVAR de novo-contig set and the FERMI-contig set) using GMcloser.24For RNA-Seq analysis, PE libraries were prepared using 1 µg of total RNA extracted from young leaves and roots of ‘Nagirizaki’ using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Plant kit (Illumina). The constructed libraries were sequenced using the HiSeq 2000 platform. The reads were assembled using Trinity, ver. 2.0,25 with the default parameters except that the min_kmer_cov option was 3, and the resulting assembled contigs with <500 bases were filtered out.2.5. Validation of assembled sequencesTo confirm the genome coverage and the accuracy of the assembled genome sequences, the core eukaryotic genes were mapped using CEGMA, v2.5.26 The quality of the assembled genome sequences was also confirmed using published DNA markers developed by Wang et al.8 The marker sequences of Z. japonica ‘El Toro’ linkage groups were mapped onto the genome sequences of ‘Nagirizaki’ using BLASTN27 with an E-value cut-off of 1E-4 considering the length (95 bp) of the marker sequences.2.6. Detection of repetitive sequencesWe detected known and novel repetitive sequences including transposable elements using the following two steps: First, the repetitive sequences were detected by RepeatScout28 with default parameters. Then, repetitive sequences were detected and masked by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) against known repetitive sequences in Repbase (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/) and novel repetitive sequences found in the first step. The repetitive sequences were classified according to the results of RepeatMasker. SSR motifs were extracted from the ‘Nagirizaki’, ‘Wakaba’, and ‘Zanpa’ genome sequences and from those of O. sativa (IRGSP-1.0), S. bicolor (Sbicolor_255_v2.0), and B. distachyon (Bdistachyon_283_v2.0) using SciRoKo29 with the MISA mode. The minimum numbers of repeats for SSR motifs were 7, 5, 4, 4 and 4 for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides, respectively.2.7. Gene assignment and annotationGenes for tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE, v1.23,30 and rRNA genes were predicted using hmmscan in HMMER, ver. 3.031 with a Rfam 11.0 (http://rfam.xfam.org) database. Genomic protein-coding genes of ‘Nagirizaki’, ‘Wakaba’, and ‘Zanpa’ were predicted using a MAKER pipeline32 as follows: Repetitive sequences were detected and masked using a combination of RepeatModeller (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html), RECON,33 RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) and RepeatRunner (https://github.com/Yandell-Lab/RepeatRunner). The training set for ‘Nagirizaki’ was built using BRAKER1 (http://exon.gatech.edu/genemark/braker1.html) with the RNA-Seq data. Prediction of the protein-coding genes was performed using Augustus 3.0.334 with the training set for ‘Nagirizaki’, and snap35 using the hidden Markov model of O. sativa. In addition, the RNA-Seq reads for ‘Nagirizaki’ were mapped onto the masked genome sequences by TopHat,36 and coding regions were detected by Cufflinks37 to generate a gff file indicating transcript units. Also, consensus transcript sequences were constructed by assembly of the RNA-Seq reads with Trinity, and were mapped onto the genome sequences by a BLASTN search and exonerate.38 Finally, the gene models supported by the above lines of evidence were selected using the MAKER pipeline. The predicted genes of ‘Nagirizaki’, ‘Wakaba’, and ‘Zanpa’ were prefixed with ‘Zjn’, ‘Zmw’, and ‘Zpz’, respectively, followed by a scaffold number, sequence version of each scaffold, gene number, and sequence version of each gene, which were connected to each other by dot characters. In addition, information about the gene prediction method was attached with the following signatures: am, assigned by Augustus; sm, assigned by snap; cf, assigned by Cufflinks; es, assigned by exonerate; and cf-es, assigned by Cufflinks and exonerate. The prediction accuracy was attached using the following signatures: mkhc, assigned with high confidence by MAKER (supported by multiple prediction methods); mk, assigned as non-overlapping genes by MAKER; and br, assigned by BRAKER1.For assumption of the functions of the predicted protein-coding genes, database searches were carried out against the NCBI's non-redundant (nr) protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the protein sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10) (https://www.arabidopsis.org), O. sativa (RAP-DB) (http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp), S. bicolor, B. distachyon, Setaria italica, Triticum aestivum, Zea mays (Phytozome, v10) (http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov), and Hordeum vulgare (Ensembl Plants) (http://plants.ensembl.org). The searches were performed using the BLAST program with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. The translated protein sequences were classified into NCBI's euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG)39 using BLASTP searches against the KOG database with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. A KOG id was assigned to each gene based on the top hit of the BLASTP search. Domain searches were performed using InterProScan40 against the InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) database with an E-value cut-off of 1.0. The genes were classified into GO slim categories using the map2slim program41 based on the domain search results. The genes of ‘Nagirizaki’, S. bicolor (Sbicolor_255_v2.0; Phytozome v10), O. sativa (IRGSP-1.0) and B. distachyon (Bdistachyon_283_v2.0; Phytozome v10) were then mapped onto the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) reference metabolic pathways42 using BLASTP searches against KEGG's KO database with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10, identity =25% and length coverage =50%. The genes were classified using CD-hit43 with parameters –c = 0.4, -G = 0 and –aS = 0.5.2.8. Comparison of genes among Z. japonica and three other Poaceae speciesTo identify common genes among Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ and the three Poaceae species, O. sativa, S. bicolor and B. distachyon, the translated protein sequences were compared by a clustering approach using CD-hit. To compare the gene order, the translated protein sequences on the pseudomolecules of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ were searched against O. sativa, S. bicolor and B. distachyon using BLAST searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-100. Synteny plots were made using a perl script and the gnuplot program (http://www.gnuplot.info).2.9. Polymorphism analysisThe PE reads of each Zoysia accession were aligned onto the genome sequence of ‘Nagirizaki’ using Bowtie 2, ver. 2.2.544 with default parameters, except for the use of an end-to-end mode. SNPs and indel candidates were detected using bam files generated using SAMtools, ver. 0.1.19, and BCFtools, ver. 0.1.19.45 After mapping, the SNP candidates on N or n nucleotides in the reference sequence were excluded. The false-positive SNPs were excluded according to the DP4 field in the VCF format.453. Results and discussion3.1 Sequencing of the Zoysia genomesA high-quality draft genome sequence of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ was generated for use, as a reference sequence. PE read data (49.3 Gb) were accumulated using the MiSeq platform. In addition, mate-pair (MP) reads were collected from three MP libraries with insert sizes of 5, 10 and 15 kb using the HiSeq 2000 platform. For Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’, ~17 Gb of data from PE reads and a single type of MP library (with 3 kb inserts) were accumulated for comparative analyses. The sequence data for each Zoysia accession are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.The kmer analysis for sequenced reads suggested that all the sequenced genomes had a high proportion of heterozygous alleles (Supplementary Figure S1). We used two computer programs for the primary assemblies: Platanus, which is suitable for assembly of highly heterozygous genomes, and the DISCOVAR de novo assembler, which is capable of generating contigs with high efficiency using PE reads with 250–300 bases of read length. The scaffolds with the highest N50 values were obtained in Platanus for Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ (Supplementary Table S2). After gap-closing by GMcloser, 334 Mb of scaffolds with an N50 length of 2.4 Mb were obtained (Table 1). Ninety percent of the scaffolds (301 Mb) were included in the 167 longest scaffolds. According to the flow cytometry analysis, the genome size of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ is ~390 Mb (0.80 pg/2C). This is 15% larger than the estimation by k-mer analysis (340 Mb) (Supplementary Table S3), presumably due to the effect of conserved regions on homeologous chromosome pairs in the tetraploid genome. Thus the genome assembly of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’, designated as ‘Zjn_r1.1’, covered 86% of the whole genome as estimated by flow cytometry. Assembly statistics of draft genome sequences of the Zoysia speciesContigs or scaffolds shorter than 499 bp were excluded.Assembly statistics of draft genome sequences of the Zoysia speciesContigs or scaffolds shorter than 499 bp were excluded.For Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’, the scaffolds were built by Opera using contigs generated by DISCOVAR de novo because DISCOVAR de novo constructed contigs with higher N50 values than the other assemblers. This may be because only a single MP library was generated for these species. The final assemblies for ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’ were generated by gap-closing with GMcloser and resulted in 563 Mb (N50 length, 109 kb) and 397 Mb (N50 length, 111 kb), respectively (Table 1). As with ‘Nagirizaki’, the genome size of ‘Zanpa’ estimated by flow cytometry (370 Mb; 0.76 pg/2C) was larger (by 23%) than the size estimated by k-mer analysis (302 Mb) (Supplementary Table S3). On the other hand, the flow cytometry estimate for ‘Wakaba’ was ~380 Mb (0.79 pg/2C), which is 11% smaller than that estimated by k-mer analysis (423 Mb) (Supplementary Table S3). This difference was presumably due to the effect of heterozygosity exceeding the effect of tetraploidy. The genome assemblies of ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’ were longer than those estimated by flow cytometry, suggesting that they contained redundant scaffolds corresponding to heterozygous alleles. This is likely because the assemblies of these two accessions were obtained with the DISCOVAR de novo and Opera assemblers, which are less able than Platanus to merge homologous sequences corresponding to the same allelic regions. Indeed, the total sizes of the scaffold assemblies of ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’ generated by Platanus were 30 and 22% smaller, respectively, than those obtained by DISCOVAR de novo (Supplementary Table S2). Considering the purpose of sequencing for comparative genome analyses, we finally adopted the DISCOVAR de novo assemblies, which presumably contained redundant scaffolds corresponding to heterozygous alleles, for these two accessions. The Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’ genomes were designated as ‘Zmw_r1.0’ and ‘Zpz_r1.0’, respectively.The CEGMA analyses of the assembled genome sequences showed that they completely cover 91.5–94.8% (the highest is for Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’), and partially cover over 97%, of the 248 conserved core eukaryotic genes (Supplementary Table S4). These high coverage data strongly indicate that the constructed genome sequences of the three Zoysia species were of high quality and sufficient for subsequent accurate gene modelling and annotation.The authenticity of the assembled genome sequences was further evaluated by comparing the genome sequence of ‘Nagirizaki’ and the published Z. japonica linkage map of RAD markers.8 We compared 1,230 marker-associated sequences on the Z. japonica ‘El Toro’ linkage map developed by Wang et al.8 with the scaffold sequences of Zjn_r1.1 and found that 1,224 (99.5%) of the sequences were successfully located on Zjn_r1.1. The 135 scaffolds in Zjn_r1.1 were each anchored by three or more markers in the ‘El Toro’ linkage groups and the order of most of the markers was in good agreement with their physical positions on the scaffolds. This result indicates a high degree of authenticity of the Zjn_r1.1 genome assembly.While comparing the ‘Nagirizaki’ scaffold sequences with the linkage map, we found that 15 scaffolds were anchored to two or three different locations on the linkage map, probably due to mis-scaffolding caused by the presence of repetitive sequences. We separated these scaffolds at the repetitive sequences at the boundaries of the anchored regions, and the latter halves of these scaffolds were designated using numbers starting with ‘2’ or ‘3’ followed by the original four-digit scaffold number (Supplementary Table S5). For example, the scaffold Zjn_sc00037 was anchored by RAD markers at three different locations on the linkage map, and thus it was separated into three scaffolds: Zjn_sc00037, Zjn_sc20037, and Zjn_sc30037. After these revisions, we constructed pseudomolecules of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ that we designated as Zjn_chr01 – Zjn_chr20 based on the ‘El Toro’ linkage group numbers. These pseudomolecules covered 82% of the Zjn_r1.1 sequence. The pseudomolecules of homeologous chromosome pairs had similar lengths, ranging from the shortest pair: Zjn_chr15 (7.7 Mb) and Zjn_chr16 (8.1 Mb) to the longest pair: Zjn_chr07 (20.3 Mb) and Zjn_chr08 (21.1 Mb). These results confirmed the even distribution of the RAD markers and indicated that the scaffolds in Zjn_r1.1 are sufficient to cover most of the Z. japonica genome (Supplementary Table S6). Therefore, the pseudomolecules of ‘Nagirizaki’ were subjected to subsequent analyses as the reference sequence of Z. japonica, together with the draft genome sequences.3.2 Characteristic features of the Zoysia genomeKnown and novel repetitive sequences, including transposable elements, were identified using RepeatMasker and RepeatScout. A classification of the repetitive elements and their content in each genome is summarized in Supplementary Table S7. The genome sequences of ‘Nagirizaki’ (Zjn_r1.1), ‘Wakaba’ (Zmw_r1.0), and ‘Zanpa’ (Zpz_r1.0) had total repeat contents of 40.9, 45.9 and 44.7%, respectively. The total repeat content in the pseudomolecules of the Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ genome (35.6%) was lower than those of the other draft sequences because the unanchored scaffolds, which were likely to contain more repetitive sequences, were not included in the pseudomolecules. Based on the methods for detection of repetitive sequences used in this study, the contents of repetitive sequences in the Zoysia species were similar to that of B. distachyon (37.7% of total genome size, 272 Mb in Bdistachyon_283_v2.0), and smaller than those of O. sativa (48.7% of 373 Mb in IRGSP-1.0) and S. bicolor (64.8% of 727 Mb in Sbicolor_255_v2.0).The SSRs in the draft genome sequences were detected using SciRoKo software, and their contents in each draft genome are summarized in Supplementary Table S8. The total numbers of the SSR motifs in the Zoysia species were 24,383 in Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ (7.07 SSRs per 100 kb), 41,883 in Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ (7.20 SSRs per 100 kb), and 29,271 in Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’ (7.15 SSRs per 100 kb). These frequencies are similar to the frequency for B. distachyon: 7.80 SSRs per 100 kb (total number: 21,818). The frequencies of di-nucleotides in the three Zoysia species were nearly the same and were close to that of S. bicolor. On the other hand, the frequencies of tri-nucleotides in the three Zoysia species were fewer than those in O. sativa, S. bicolor and B. distachyon.Genes for tRNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE and rRNA genes were predicted using HMMER3 searches against the Rfam database. Totals of 514, 827 and 597 tRNA genes (Supplementary Table S9), and 59, 47 and 52 rRNA genes were assigned to the draft genome sequences of ‘Nagirizaki’, ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’, respectively. The numbers of predicted non-coding RNA genes were roughly proportional to the lengths of the assembled genome sequences of the three species. Although the genome size of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ (390 Mb) is similar to that of O. sativa (373 Mb), the number of predicted tRNA genes in ‘Nagirizaki’ (514) is ~73% of that in O. sativa (705).3.3 Characteristic features of the protein-coding genesThe protein-coding genes were predicted for the three Zoysia species using multiple computer programs as described in the Materials and methods section. The number of coding sequences predicted in ‘Nagirizaki’ (Zjn_r1.1) was 59,271 with an N50 length of 1,119 bp (Table 2). Of these, 49,103 sequences were assigned to the pseudomolecules of ‘Nagirizaki’. When the predicted genes on the homeologous chromosome pairs were compared in detail, more than half of the genes seemed to be lost from one of the pairs (Supplementary Table S10). This explained why the number of predicted genes in tetraploid Z. japonica is less than twice those in the diploid Poaceae species O. sativa (35,626 genes) and S. bicolor (33,032 genes). On the other hand, the total numbers of protein-coding genes predicted on the draft genome sequences of ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Zanpa’ were 95,079 and 65,252, with N50 lengths of 1,065 and 1,062 bp, respectively (Table 2). The higher numbers of genes predicted for these two accessions presumably reflects the presence of redundant scaffolds corresponding to heterozygous alleles in Zmw_r1.0 and Zpz_r1.0. Statistics of genes predicted in the draft genome sequences of Zoysia speciesStatistics of genes predicted in the draft genome sequences of Zoysia speciesThe predicted protein-coding genes of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’, O. sativa, S. bicolor, and B. distachyon were assigned to the functional categories of NCBI's euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG). The percentages of proteins in each KOG category are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The four species showed similar percentages of proteins in each functional category. The predicted genes were then classified into GO slim categories based on the results of the domain searches using InterProScan against the InterPro database. The percentages of genes in the root categories Biological Process (BP), Cellular Components (CC) and Molecular Function (MF) were also similar among the four related species (Supplementary Figure S3).The metabolic pathways of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’, O. sativa, S. bicolor, and B. distachyon were then compared by mapping the genes of each genome onto the reference map of pathways in the ‘Metabolism’ group of the KEGG database. As a result, most of the enzymes found in Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ were conserved in other three Poaceae species (Supplementary Table S11). However, there were eight enzymes found only in Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’, which were classified into seven pathways including ‘Sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis’, ‘Benzoxazinoid biosynthesis’, and ‘Benzoate degradation’ (Supplementary Table S11). The entire results from the mapping of the metabolic pathways are available on the ‘Zoysia Genome Database’ at http://zoysia.kazusa.or.jp.Plant adaptation to high saline environments is mediated by complex interactions among salt-stress responsive genes and transcription factors (TFs).46 The NAC family is one of the largest groups of plant-specific TFs involved in plant development and abiotic stress. A member of the NAC family, ANAC102, was reported to play a role in salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis.47 To elucidate the high salt tolerance mechanisms in Zoysia species, we searched for ANAC102-like genes in the three Zoysia genome sequences. Two ANAC102-like genes were identified in each Zoysia genome (Supplementary Figure S4). Among the first group (Zjn_sc00013.1.g08180.1, Zmw_sc04858.1.g00100.1, and Zpz_sc00127.1.g00380.1) we found high degrees of similarity in amino acid sequences and small number of mutations, and each gene was equally represented in the three species. The second group (Zjn_sc00014.1.g08280.1, Zmw_sc02298.1.g00200.1, Zmw_sc02531.1.g00150.1 and Zpz_sc01716.1.g00180.1) was similar to the first group in amino acid sequences but had differences in the mutation sites. However, Z. japonica and Z. pacifica each had a distinctive sequence feature in the corresponding 5' upstream region, and both features were found in Z. matrella (Supplementary Figure S5). Based on the positions of these ANAC102-like genes on the ‘Nagirizaki’ pseudomolecules, two copies were retained on both homeologous chromosomes (Zjn_chr01 and Zjn_chr02). These differences of ANAC102-like genes may provide some contribution to salt tolerance in the Zoysia species.The B-box type zinc-finger family of TFs are also key factors in regulatory networks such as those related to salt stress.48 Specifically, the Salt Tolerance/B-Box Zinc-Finger Protein 24 (STO/BBX24) of A. thaliana was found to increase salt tolerance in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae),49 and the overexpression of STO/BBX24 enhances the root growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in a high salt medium.50 To investigate the contribution of STO/BBX24 to salt tolerance in Zoysia species, we compared the structures of the STO/BBX24 genes in the three Zoysia species. We found two structurally distinguishable sequences in corresponding regions of the Z. japonica and Z. pacifica genomes, while both alleles were found in Z. matrella (Supplementary Figure S6). Moreover, mutations were found in the 5' upstream region of each STO/BBX24 gene (Supplementary Figure S7). Zoysia matrella tends to possess higher level of salt tolerance than Z. japonica and Z. pacifica.2,51 The polymorphisms that we found in the ANAC102 and STO/BBX24 genes may imply that these genes contribute to the variation in salt tolerance levels among these three Zoysia species.Another zinc-binding B-box domain protein that is involved in plant responses to salinity and dehydration is a leucine zipper (bZIP) TF.52,53Sporobolus virginicus is another halophyte turfgrass in the tribe Zoysiae, along with the Zoysia species. A comprehensive analysis of transcripts involved in salt tolerance in, S. virginicus revealed five bZIP genes with root-specific salt-responsive expression.54 Only two of these bZIP genes (PK07387.1 and evm_27.model.AmTr_v1.0_scaffold00081.79 in PlantTFDB3.055) were conserved in the Zoysia genomes. This suggests that Zoysia species may have different mechanisms for salt tolerance than those in S. virginicus.Anthocyanins are a class of phenolic compounds responsible for the red to purple pigmentation in plants. They are involved in plant defenses and stress avoidance due to their antioxidant properties.56 Ahn et al.11 reported that zoysiagrasses exhibit red to purple pigments in their spike and stolon tissues. A transcriptome analysis of Z. japonica accessions with either green or purple tissues was used to identify two genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis: anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR). In another study, a Ginko biloba ANS gene showed synergistic patterns of expression in anthocyanin accumulation and abiotic stress responses.57 Therefore, ANS genes are implicated in responses to adverse environment stresses including high levels of salinity.57 A single ANS1 orthologue was identified in each of Z. japonica and Z. pacifica, and these genes were designated as ZjANS1 and ZpANS1 (Supplementary Figure S8). A comparison of the ZjANS1 and ZpANS1 sequences revealed a number of SNPs and indels in the 5' upstream regions and 27 SNPs in the coding regions, including an SNP in the termination codon of ZjANS1 that extends the coding region for an additional 27 bp. These polymorphisms may reflect the diversity of anthocyanin pigmentation within and between species of the genus Zoysia, as described in previous reports.11,58 As is the case for the ANAC102 and STO/BBX24, the ANS1 gene was heterozygous in Z. matrella, and both ZjANS1 and ZpANS1 were identified in the ‘Wakaba’ genome assembly (Supplementary Figure S9). Zoysia matrella shows wide variations in morphological traits, most of which are intermediate between those of Z. japonica and Z. pacifica. Tanaka et al.5 conducted an SSR marker analysis and suggested that Z. matrella might represent an interspecific hybrid between Z. japonica and Z. pacifica. The combinations of the ANAC102, STO/BBX24, and ANS1 alleles in the three Zoysia genomes provide additional supportive evidence for this hypothesis.3.4 Comparative genome analysisIn order to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among the Zoysia species, we collected genome sequence reads from three additional accessions, Z. japonica ‘Kyoto’, Z. japonica ‘Miyagi’, and Z. matrella ‘Chiba Fair Green’. The reads from these three accessions and those from Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’ were aligned against the reference genome of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’. We identified a total of 7,424,163 SNPs including 3,660,698 SNPs in two or more accessions (common SNPs) (Table 3). Additionally, we found a total of 852,488 short indels of 1–60 bp; of which, 319,551 were common to two or more accessions (Supplementary Table S12). These total numbers of SNPs and indels are well correlated with the previously reported phylogenetic relationships among Zoysia species based on DNA marker analyses.4,59,60 In Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’, the majority of SNPs and indels were homozygous in each allele, whereas Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’ and ‘Chiba Fair Green’ had higher numbers of heterozygous SNPs and indels (Table 3). Summary of SNPs between Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ and other Zoysia speciesSummary of SNPs between Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ and other Zoysia speciesTo investigate the homozygous and heterozygous features of the Zoysia genomes, the genotype of each SNP locus was classified into one of the three types: homozygous with the reference allele (R), homozygous with an alternative allele (A), or heterozygous (H). The zoysiagrass accessions were compared in the following order: Z. japonica ‘Kyoto’, Z. japonica ‘Miyagi’, Z. matrella ‘Wakaba’, Z. matrella ‘Chiba Fair Green’, and Z. pacifica ‘Zanpa’. The most common genotype pattern was R-R-H-H-A, with 670,724 SNP sites (18.3% of total), followed by R-R-H-R-A (13.4%), R-R-A-R-A (5.8%), and R-R-R-H-A (5.8%) (Supplementary Table S13). A similar tendency was observed in the pattern of common indels (Supplementary Table S14). The results indicate that most of the polymorphisms among the three Zoysia species are between Z. japonica and Z. pacifica, and these sites are often heterozygous in Z. matrella. These data, along with the heterozygosity of the ANAC102, STO/BBX24, and ANS1 genes in Z. matrella, and the results from our previous study using SSR markers5 all support the high probability that Z. matrella is an interspecific hybrid between Z. japonica and Z. pacifica. This possibility would further support a hypothesis that Z. matrella is a homoploid hybrid species since the nature of Z. matrella reflects the criteria for homoploid hybrid speciation. These criteria include: similar chromosome numbers with parental species, ability to backcross with parental species, intermediate phenotypic traits, and ecological divergence from parents.61 The information obtained in this study will provide new clues about the origin of Zoysia. In addition, our results highlight the importance of hybridization and polyploidization in grass diversification, which have implications for conservation.Synteny among the Poaceae genomes was investigated by comparing the positions of genes on the Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ pseudomolecules with their positions in the genome sequences of O. sativa, S. bicolor, and B. distachyon (see Materials and methods section for details). As shown in a Venn diagram in Supplementary Figure S10, 8,596 of 53,625 genes (16.0%) were conserved in these four Poaceae species, while 17,288 genes (32.2%) occurred in clusters only found in Z. japonica. Based on the homologous genes thus identified and their positions on the pseudomolecules, we generated dot-plot diagrams between Z. japonica and the three other Poaceae species. The results revealed extensive collinearities in all cases, and remarkable collinearities between the entire genomes of O. sativa and S. bicolor (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs S11 and S12). The comparison between Z. japonica and S. bicolor clearly revealed the following rearrangements: the middle section of S. bicolor chromosome 1 corresponded with the middle sections of Z. japonica chromosomes 7 and 8, and the middle section of S. bicolor chromosome 2 corresponded with the middle sections of Z. japonica chromosomes 19 and 20 (Fig. 1). The rearranged regions of chromosomes 7 and 8 and chromosomes 19 and 20 in Z. japonica corresponded to chromosomes 10 and 9 in O. sativa, respectively (Supplementary Figure S11). These rearrangements between the Z. japonica and S. bicolor genomes support the possibility that ‘invading’ chromosomes, the paleo-ancestors of chromosomes 10 and 9, integrated into different sets of chromosomes in Z. japonica and S. bicolor, as discussed in a previous study using RAD markers of Z. japonica.8Comparison between the Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ and S. bicolor genomes. The translated protein sequences on the pseudomolecules of Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ and S. bicolor were compared by BLAST searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-100, and the top hits were plotted. A hit on the same strand between both species is coloured in red, while hits on reverse strands are coloured in blue.Comparison between the Z. japonica ‘Nagirizaki’ and S. bicolor genomes.

IntroductionThe turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a flatfish naturally distributed around the European coast from the East and Northeast Atlantic Ocean, including the Baltic Sea, along the Mediterranean up to the Black Sea. As a flatfish, the turbot is adapted to a benthic lifestyle, and thus lives in shallow waters mainly during larvae and juvenile stages, moving to deep waters upon reaching adulthood. It displays a cryptic body colour, is covered by a mucous scaleless skin, follows a carnivorous narrow prey-spectrum diet, and undergoes a complete metamorphosis to adapt to benthic life (https://aquatrace.eu/leaflets/turbot). Genetic evidence of flatfish adaptation to sea bottom has been reported from the whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis).1 However, adaptations to the low oxygen concentration, low light levels, microbiota, and prey range characteristic of the sea bottom may have involved different strategies. This diversity may be related either to a rapid adaptive radiation of flatfish or to a polyphyletic origin.2The great commercial value of turbot has promoted its intensive farming during the last decade (~75,000 t) (https://aquatrace.eu/leaflets/turbot). The main goals of breeding programmes in this species are increased growth rate, control of sex ratio, and improved disease resistance. Study of the variation in these traits is also essential for understanding local adaptation of turbot populations.3 Although quantitative trait variability has traditionally been attributed to many loci with small effects, genome association screening has demonstrated the existence of specific genomic regions that explain an important proportion of the phenotypic variance of these traits.4 The detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in turbot has recently been initiated for growth,5,6 sex determination (SD),7 and resistance to the main industrial diseases.8–10 While increasing amounts of turbot genomic data have begun to enable a deeper knowledge of the genomic basis of these traits, a reference genome sequence is essential to achieve more efficient selection and sustainable management of wild resources.In this study, we report a high-quality genome of the turbot by integrating high-throughput genome sequencing and previous genomic resources.11,12 Our assembly of the turbot genome spans 544 Mb (~96% of estimated genome content), is highly contiguous with a scaffold N50 of 4.3 Mb, and has a transposable element (TE) content representing ~5% of the genome. We identified 22,751 protein-coding genes transcribed into 28,189 mRNAs by using gene prediction and empirical transcriptomic data. We anchored 80% of the genome assembly to the turbot genetic map,13,14 thus enabling comparative mapping with other fish genomes and facilitating the consolidation of the turbot map in accordance with its karyotype. We found a nearly 1:1 relationship between turbot linkage groups (LGs) and those of other Percomorpha, although we also observed important micro-reorganizations within each LG. Paralogous relationships showed the conservation of important collinear blocks within the turbot genome, most likely the result of the ancestral teleost genome duplication. Some of these paralogous genes may represent genetic expansions related to adaptations to benthic lifestyle and to low temperatures. The genomic architecture of growth, SD, and resistance to pathologies was investigated using previously reported QTL as a reference. We mapped candidate genes using the established relationship between physical and genetic maps, and also identified new candidates and enriched functions by gene mining around the most strongly associated markers. Our results provide new insights into flatfish evolution and enable the development of more refined genomic breeding tools.2. Materials and methodsThe statistical and bioinformatics approaches as well as public repositories used in this study are outlined in this section. Most details on statistical packages, software and the parameters applied for each analysis are included in Supplementary Methods, File S1.2.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyWGS was performed using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and HiSeq2000 sequencing instruments. The standard Illumina protocol with slight modifications was followed for the construction of short-insert paired-end (PE) and mate pair (MP) libraries. A fosmid library was constructed in the pNGS vector (Lucigen Corp.) and the DNA was processed for end sequencing following the Lucigen protocol. Genome size was estimated by analysing genomic k-mer content.PE reads were assembled into unitigs, then into contigs and finally into scaffolds. At each assembly step, sequences were filtered from contaminating sequences, their ends trimmed and finally subjected to a misassembly detection routine. Scaffolds were reassembled using MP and fosmid-end sequences and gap-filled at each step.2.2. Comparative mappingTo anchor scaffolds to the genetic map, we performed a similarity search of the genomic sequences corresponding to linkage mapping markers against the turbot genome. The correspondence between LGs of the turbot genetic map and chromosomes/scaffolds of the model species was drawn with MAPCHART 2.2.15 Sequences of orthologous genes from anchored scaffolds were compared with the updated versions from model fish genomes downloaded from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org: Tetraodonnigroviridis v.8.61, Oryziaslatipes v.1.61 and C. semilaevis, in order to identify syntenies. Orthologous relationships among species and paralogous relationships within the turbot genome were represented with circle diagrams using CIRCOS.16 Non-anchored scaffolds were predictively mapped on turbot LGs by comparing nucleotide sequences of orthologous genes against model fish genomes. Those scaffolds matching in the same homologous position with at least three reference species were predictively mapped at specific turbot LGs.2.3. Repetitive elementsThe repetitive component of the turbot genome was analysed using a combination of ab initio and sequence homology-based methods. The assembled genome was analysed to determine low-complexity sequences, short repetitive motifs, and interspersed repeats. The genome sequence was further analysed to extract the nucleotide sequences of the putatively full-length insertions (>80% length of the closest canonical query sequence), as described elsewhere,17 using RepBase database sequences as a query. All TE-derived sequences were named according to the RepBase element sequence that produced the highest match score and classified.2.4. Protein-coding gene annotationTurbot RNA-seq, ESTs, cDNAs, and mRNAs deposited in public databases and Percomorpha proteins from Uniprot were combined with ab initio gene predictions to produce a set of consensus coding sequence models, which were then updated to include untranslated (UTR sequences) and annotated alternative splice forms.2.5. RNA genes annotationNon-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes were annotated by running the program cmsearch v1.1 within Infernal (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24008419) against the RFAM database of RNA families (v12.0) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23125362). Also, transfer RNAs (tRNA)-scan-SE (v1.23) (http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/5/0955.full) was run in order to detect the transfer RNA genes present in the genome assembly of S. maximus.2.6. Proteome functional annotationFor the functional annotation of the identified protein-coding genes, we used an in-house developed automatic pipeline. An electronic inference of function was performed based on the sequence similarity between our proteins and other sequences annotated in different public repositories. Different strategies and software were employed to obtain gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG orthology (KO) groups. KO identifiers were then used to retrieve KEGG relevant functional annotations. GO terms distribution was determined according to functional categories.2.7. Orthologues and paralogues identification: similarity approachThe turbot proteome was compared using BLASTP (E-value: 1e-05) against those of medaka (O. latipes), Tetraodon (T. nigroviridis), and tongue sole (C. semilaevis) to identify orthology relationships, and against the turbot genome itself to look for paralogy. Orthology relationships were established following a reciprocal best-match strategy: we first looked for orthology between turbot and two model fish (medaka and Tetraodon) and then, from the obtained list, we investigated orthology with tongue sole. Paralogy relationships between turbot proteins were deduced using a reciprocal second best-match strategy. Pairs of paralogues were annotated using BlastKOALA (http://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/) for KO codes. Only those pairs with the same KEGG annotation were considered to be consistent paralogues for further analysis.2.8. PhylogenomicsThe turbot phylome was reconstructed using the phylomeDB pipeline.18 For each turbot gene, a search was performed against the proteome database of the 17 selected species (Supplementary File 1: Table S1). Multiple alignments of homologous sequences were built and then used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Paralogy and orthology predictions for the species considered were analysed based on the turbot phylome. Gene duplications in the turbot lineage were identified and used to estimate gene enrichment using the turbot proteome as a reference. A total of 389 genes with one-to-one orthologues in each studied species were selected and their alignments concatenated to derive the species tree. We also reconstructed a super-tree from all single gene trees in the turbot phylome using a parsimony strategy.2.9. Adaptation to benthic life-styleParalog relationships identified from the similarity and phylogenetic approaches were combined to obtain a consistent set of paralogues resultant from specific duplications in the turbot or flatfish (incorporating C. semilaevis) genome lineages. A filtering was performed on that list to avoid artefacts from genome assembling after detecting an excess of paralogues in small scaffolds with 100% homology with the major ones. So, all paralogues included in scaffolds <20 kb with >98% homology to the biggest ones were discarded for this analysis. This set of paralogues was evaluated to identify functional enriched pathways using the turbot transcriptome as a background (false discovery rate (FDR) <5%) and gene family expansions that could be related to particular adaptations of flatfish to benthic lifestyle. Phylogenetic analysis of selected gene sequences was performed by the neighbour joining method, using the JTT amino acid substitution model. Selective pressures on particular genes or gene families that could explain adaptation to the benthic life-style were investigated both through evaluation of gene family expansions from the set of paralogues, as well as by analysing the ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) vs. synonymous (Ks) substitution rates (Ka/Ks) on candidate genes with the closely related and well-annotated species medaka (O. latipes), Tetraodon (T. nigroviridis), and tongue sole (C. semilaevis).2.10. Genetic architecture of growth, resistance to diseases, and SDBased on previous reports and our own data, a list of candidate genes for sex-, growth-, and immune-related traits in fish and vertebrates was obtained. These genes were located in the turbot genome and then in the genetic map using the established relationship between them both. Analyses were focused on major QTL associated with growth, SD, or disease resistance, and on those overlapping for different traits. Mining analysis around selected QTL for these traits was performed to identify additional candidates and enriched pathways or functions using the turbot transcriptome (22,751 genes) as a background (FDR <5%) within the extracted gene lists. Selected candidate genes identified across QTL regions and traits were represented in the turbot genetic map13 using Mapchart 2.2.153. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyWe sequenced the turbot genome using a whole genome shotgun approach. To facilitate hierarchical assembly, we constructed two PE libraries, two MP libraries and a fosmid-end library and sequenced them on the Illumina platform (Supplementary File 1: Table S2). The final assembly (‘sm5’) has a total length of 544 Mb, including 14 Mb of gaps. The contig N50 is 31.2 kb and the scaffold N50 is 4.3 Mb. The largest scaffold is 19 Mb long and 95% of the assembly is found in 287 scaffolds =166 kb. The GC content is 43.3%. The percentage of complete and partial core eukaryotic genes (248 genes in total) according to the CEGMA pipeline is 98 and 99%, respectively. Using the depth of the main 17-k-mer peak (114 from a total of 129,589,789,624 k-mers), we estimated the turbot genome size to be 568 Mb (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S1), so our assembly represents 95.8% of this estimation. Sequencing data are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with the following study accession: PRJEB11743.Repetitive sequences make up to 8.5% of the turbot genome (Supplementary File 1: Table S3). These are grouped into three main categories: simple repeats (3%), low-complexity motifs (0.5%), and TEs (5%). The TE-derived fraction is very similar to that found in the other known flatfish genome (C. semilaevis; 5.8% TEs).1 The turbot displays a higher proportion of TEs than T. nigroviridis and Fugu rubripes (<3%), but much lower than that observed in other fish such as Danio rerio (>40%).19,20The genome assembly was compared with the turbot genetic map (486 mapped markers out of 513 genotyped; Supplementary Table S4, Supplementary Data).13,14 All genetic markers with available sequence (492 of 513; 96%) match unique positions in 162 scaffolds. Using genetic markers, 150 of these scaffolds were anchored to single LGs. Six scaffolds were anchored to two LGs; the break points in which were confirmed by comparative mapping with model species (see below), suggesting assembly errors. In total, 156 scaffolds were anchored, representing 79.7% of the assembly. The remaining six scaffolds with markers contain only matches to unlinked markers.3.2. Gene and functional annotationCombining empirical transcriptomic data and ab initio predictions, we identified a preliminary set of 22,751 genes, whose 28,189 transcripts encode 26,823 unique proteins (Supplementary Table S5). Of the 28,189 transcripts, 24,239 are supported by protein alignments, 22,597 by GMAP transcript alignments, and 25,737 (91%) by either protein or GMAP transcripts. The rest are supported by ab initio gene predictions. We also identified a total of 5,808 ncRNA genes in the turbot genome (Supplementary Table S6), including 176 ribosomal RNAs genes, 766 tRNA genes, 285 microRNAs (miRNA), 779 small nuclear RNAs, one small cytoplasmic RNA gene, and 12 long non-coding RNAs genes.A total of 23,460 (87.5%) proteins are assigned some type of annotation feature. We identified 18,571 (69.2%) proteins using Blast2GO and 11,307 (42.2%) using KEGG, and 19,445 (72.5%) have both Blast2GO and KEGG annotations. In total, 23,245 (86.6%) proteins exhibited some type of protein signature using InterProScan (Supplementary File 1: Table S7). The correspondence between the protein length and the number of annotated and non-annotated proteins makes it evident that non-annotated sequences tend to be smaller (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S3), which is likely due to incomplete open reading frames erroneously predicted by the automatic annotation pipeline. Using the three available resources (InterPro, KEGG and Blast2GO), we associated at least one GO term to 20,927 (78.0%) proteins: 16,590 to Biological Process, 14,489 to Cellular Component, and 18,522 to Molecular Function (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S4).3.3. Orthologues and paralogues: comparative genomicsA list of 10,050 orthologous genes was obtained by identifying the best common reciprocal BLAST match of the 22,751 turbot predicted genes against the proteomes of two closely related and well-annotated species (O. latipes and T. nigroviridis). This list was additionally used to look for orthology with C. semilaevis, so that 7,090 orthologous genes were identified (Supplementary Table S8). The relationship between the turbot genetic map and the reference genomes of these species was evaluated by comparing the position of ~8,000 orthologues included in the 156 anchored scaffolds to the turbot genetic map. We observe large syntenic blocks, indicative of the high evolutionary conservation of chromosome organization within Percomorpha (Fig. 1). Most turbot LGs show a 1:1 relationship with specific chromosomes of the three reference genomes, indicating a conserved macrosyntenic pattern. Only a few major reorganizations resulting from chromosome fusions or fissions, and some minor translocations, were detected. According to this analysis, LG8 and LG18 on the one hand, and LG21 and LG24 on the other, match to single orthologous chromosomes in the three reference genomes, which confirms their merging into a single chromosome in accordance with the turbot karyotype (2n = 22).21 However, when the sequences of the 10 major turbot scaffolds and the genome of the two closest species, the flatfish tongue sole (C. semilaevis) and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were compared using BLAST (E-value <e-100) (see Phylogenomics), a notable amount of chromosome micro-reorganizations were detected (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S5). Interestingly, many more reorganizations were observed with regard to tongue sole than to stickleback, which suggests a high chromosome evolutionary rate within Pleuronectiformes in accordance with previous molecular information.22Macrosyntenic relationship pattern between turbot (S. maximus) and three related Percomorpha species (medaka, Tetraodon, and tongue sole). LG 8 and 18 (LG8 - 18) and 21 and 24 (LG21 - 24) are grouped indicating their merging in single chromosomes as suggested by the syntenic patterns observed with the three species.Macrosyntenic relationship pattern between turbot (S. maximus) and three related Percomorpha species (medaka, Tetraodon, and tongue sole). LG 8 and 18 (LG8 - 18) and 21 and 24 (LG21 - 24) are grouped indicating their merging in single chromosomes as suggested by the syntenic patterns observed with the three species.Comparative mapping with the aforementioned fish species allowed us to: (i) detect the misassembly of four major scaffolds (s00001, s00003, s00008, and s00016), which were in turn disassembled and then anchored to specific LGs (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S2, Supplementary Data); (ii) anchor 61 additional scaffolds, thus increasing the mapping coverage up to 489 Mb (89.9% of turbot genome) (Supplementary Table S9); and (iii) assign 20 of 27 unlinked markers to specific LGs (Supplementary Table S4).Paralogous relationships between the 22,751 turbot genes were initially hypothesized using a second best hit reciprocal BLAST strategy, leading to 3,035 putative paralogous pairs. An additional filtering was applied and only those pairs with the same assigned KO code were retained, constituting a consistent set of 1,858 pairs of paralogues (Supplementary Table S10). A circle diagram (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S6) and an oxford plot (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S7) were constructed with paralogous pairs using the 156 anchored scaffolds, and important syntenic blocks were identified between pairs of chromosomes. While in some cases, a 1:1 relationship was highly supported (LG3–LG23, LG4–LG6, LG10–LG11, LG12–LG14), in other cases, three or more LGs were involved, suggesting genomic reorganizations of homeologous chromosomes arisen from the teleost genome duplication.13.4. PhylogenomicsTo ascertain the evolution of the turbot genome, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of all identified turbot genes along with those of another 17 sequenced teleosts (Supplementary File 1: Table S1) with the phylomeDB pipeline.18 Gene family trees were analysed to predict orthologous and paralogous relationships, thus complementing the previous analysis. This approach enabled us to detect and date duplication events and to transfer functional annotations from one-to-one orthologues. All trees and alignments are available through PhylomeDB (www.phylomeDB.org, PhylomeID=18). We reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of the species under study by concatenating the alignments of 389 genes that were present in single copy in all analysed species and by building a super-tree combining all individual gene trees from the phylome. Both approaches resulted in the same, highly supported topology (Fig. 2), which is largely consistent with the reported relationships of the studied species.23 Our phylogeny shows that tongue sole is the closest species to turbot and that these two species are grouped with G. aculeatus, as previously suggested.24 This group is closer to the clade containing Oryzias, Oreochromis, and Xiphophorus than to the one containing Tetraodon and Takifugu, a relationship not recovered when a smaller set of genes was used.23 Then we mapped to this species tree the duplications detected in all gene trees and computed duplication densities per branch in all lineages leading to turbot (Fig. 2). Our results show the largest peaks of duplication densities at the base of vertebrates and at the base of teleosts (only represented by Otomorpha species in this study), which correspond to the known rounds of ancestral genome duplications. Interestingly, a notable duplication density was detected within Pleuronectiformes when comparing turbot against tongue sole (0.036). We found that genes families duplicated at the teleost whole genome duplication are enriched in ion transporters (calcium, potassium) related to osmoregulation as previously reported.25Phylogenetic tree obtained from the concatenation of 389 single copy, widespread genes in 17 selected fish species. All nodes are maximally supported (100% bootstrap). Numbers on the branches indicate gene duplication densities (average number of duplications per gene and per lineage) in the turbot (S. maximus) lineage.Phylogenetic tree obtained from the concatenation of 389 single copy, widespread genes in 17 selected fish species. All nodes are maximally supported (100% bootstrap). Numbers on the branches indicate gene duplication densities (average number of duplications per gene and per lineage) in the turbot (S. maximus) lineage.3.5. Adaptation to benthic life styleAs the genetic basis of adaptation to the particular benthic life conditions of this species was unknown, we examined genomic expansions and signals of positive selection from turbot paralogues and candidate genes, respectively. We identified gene families related to vision and to cell membrane composition that duplicated in the turbot genome when compared with other fish species. Also, 25 significantly enriched KEGG pathways (FDR <5%) were identified in the list of paralogues associated with immune system, membrane functions, lipid and amino acid metabolism, olfactory system and detoxification processes (Supplementary Table S11).Rhodopsin (RH), and specifically the green-sensitive opsin, is the primary pigment of rod photoreceptors enabling vision in low light conditions, such as those existing in the sea bottom.26 We found duplications of two green-sensitive RH genes in the turbot genome (rh2a, rh2b) when compared with the genomes of 10 different fish species, including the flatfish tongue sole1 (Fig. 3). An additional fifth RH rh2 gene and another one sensitive to ultraviolet light were also detected in the turbot genome but they were missing in the tongue sole. Altogether, turbot shows the highest number of green-sensitive opsins (5) among the fish species studied. Additionally, turbot showed six copies of ß-crystalline b (crybb) genes, a number similar to model fish, while the tongue sole has only one. Interestingly, we detected in turbot 15 copies of gamma-crystalline m2 (crygm2) and 10 copies of gamma-crystalline m3 (crygm3), genes that usually appear in only two copies in model teleosts, excluding zebrafish. No signals of positive selection were detected between duplicated opsin 2 genes of turbot with regard to other fish species from the estimated ratio of non-synonymous (Ka) vs synonymous (Ks) rates (Ka/Ks = 0.071–0.258; Supplementary Table S12; Fig. 3), nor with the remaining opsin genes (opsins UV: 0.140–0.390; RHs: 0.053–0.183). Phylogenetic relationships of the RH genes of turbot (S. maximus) with other fish with available genome. Branches with support lower than 50 were collapsed.Phylogenetic relationships of the RH genes of turbot (S. maximus) with other fish with available genome. Branches with support lower than 50 were collapsed.The most important biochemical response of poikilothermic organisms to environmental cooling is to increase unsaturated fatty acids of both membrane and depot lipids.27 Accordingly, tissues of marine fish contain higher amounts of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) than other vertebrate taxa.28 PUFA content within fish is also variable according to their optimal living temperature. Since PUFA are particularly susceptible to peroxidation, phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and subsequent reduction by glutathione, dependent-glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are required to prevent oxidative damage.29 In turbot, we identified five copies of pla2 and two copies of gpx1 genes (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we could detect signals of positive selection in three pla2 genes (turbot2, turbot3, and turbot4; Fig. 4) which showed consistent positive Ka/Ks values between them (Supplementary Table S12). The only fish species with more pla2 copies than turbot is the cod (Gadus morhua) (6) which lives in very cold waters, while all other fish show two copies at most. Two copies of gpx1 are also found in other fish species, but not in the tongue sole (1 copy). We also identified two copies of the glutathione synthetase gene (gss) in turbot (Fig. 4), an enzyme involved in glutathione synthesis, thus being the only fish species with two gss copies.

Genetic architecture of SD, growth, and resistance to diseasesQTL related to SD, resistance to diseases and growth were previously reported in turbot.6–10 We used the turbot genome and the previously reported QTL to investigate the genomic architecture of these traits (Supplementary Tables S13–S17; Fig. 5). Genetic architecture (QTL and candidate genes) of sex determination (red; SD), growth (blue; BW: body weight; BL: length; FK: Fulton's Factor) and resistance to diseases (green; VHSV, virus of the hemorrhagic septicaemia; AS, A. salmonicida; PD, P. dicentrarchi) in turbot (S. maximus).Genetic architecture (QTL and candidate genes) of sex determination (red; SD), growth (blue; BW: body weight; BL: length; FK: Fulton's Factor) and resistance to diseases (green; VHSV, virus of the hemorrhagic septicaemia; AS, A. salmonicida; PD, P. dicentrarchi) in turbot (S. maximus).Sex determination behaves like a complex trait and shows a high evolutionary turnover in fish.30 A major SD region at LG5 and another three minor ones at LG6, LG8, and LG21 were previously reported in turbot7 and data suggest that the turbot SD region is of recent origin.24 Understanding SD is relevant for turbot industry because females largely outgrow males.We selected 186 candidate genes involved in sexual differentiation, and, with a broader perspective, in reproduction, to be mapped in the turbot genome and predictively located in the genetic map (Supplementary Table S14A; Fig. 5). Only one, stra8 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8), was not found in the turbot genome. In higher vertebrates, meiosis is triggered by the induction of stra8 through the retinoic acid pathway.31 Within fish, stra8 has been identified in catfish (Silus meridionalis), but not in model fish genomes. A stra8-independent signalling pathway, also based on retinoic acid, has been proposed to regulate meiotic initiation in those teleosts,31 and it could also be functioning in turbot.The highest concentration of candidate genes was detected at LGs where the SD-QTL had been reported. Some of the genes mined around these QTL (Supplementary Table S15A), like lhx9, ar, and members of the sox family (sox8a, sox9a, and sox17), would deserve special attention because they have been specifically related to SD or early gonad development in other fish species.32–34 In particular, sox9, which plays a key role at the initial steps of testis differentiation, has been suggested as SD in brill (Scophthalmus rombus), a close relative to turbot.35Growth is under complex genetic control and influenced by environmental, metabolic, and physiological factors.36,37 Growth traits constitute the main target of breeding programmes in fish38 and have been related to adaptive variation in wild populations of turbot.3,39 Growth-associated QTL markers6,10 (Supplementary Table S13B) and 208 selected candidate genes from fish and vertebrates36,37 were mapped in the turbot genome, and most of them predictively located in the turbot genetic map (85%) (Supplementary Table S14B; Fig. 5). A main cluster was detected at LG16, where several growth-related QTL had been reported.6 Some genes located within a major Fulton's factor (FK)-QTL at LG16 (myf5, myf6, and igf1) were previously used for growth-assisted selection in livestock and other aquaculture species.36,40 This region has also been associated with body length (BL) in turbot,5 body weight (BW) in brill (S. rhombus),41 and FK and BW in salmonids.42,43 Other genes (Supplementary Tables S14B and S15B) and functions related to regulation of muscle development and growth were found at specific LGs (Supplementary File 1: Results).Disease control represents one of the main challenges for turbot aquaculture, and variation at immune genes has also been invoked to explain genetic differentiation of wild populations of turbot.44 Most genes involved in the major vertebrate immune response were identified in the turbot genome. The crucial role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the innate immune response is well known.45 Teleost TLR families share common properties with their mammalian counterparts, but they vary largely among fish species.46 A complete repertoire of bacterial and viral TLR receptors were identified in the turbot genome (Supplementary File 1: Fig. S8). Nevertheless, the mammalian orthologues of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr10 were not identified, as occurs in the other teleost species. In spite of tlr4 and its accessory molecules (cd14 and md2) being missing in the turbot genome, the acute-phase LPS Binding Protein (lbp) was successfully identified. In zebrafish, belonging to the only known fish group containing tlr4a and tlr4b (cyprinids), these genes do not seem to be the functional receptors of LPS,47 unlike in mammals, and therefore the mechanism underlying LPS recognition in fish remains unclear and is an interesting question for future investigations.Previous QTL screening for resistance and survival to a bacterium, Aeromonas salmonicida (AS), a parasite, Philasterides dicentrarchi (PD), and a virus, haemorrhagic septicaemia virus revealed specific genomic regions explaining a significant proportion of trait variance,8–10 thus representing a reference to tackle their genetic basis. Relevant immune genes were detected at QTL related to the studied diseases (Supplementary File 1: Results, Supplementary DataC; Fig. 5), and some of them identified at QTL associated with different pathogens (Supplementary Table S15C), which suggests a general role in immune response. Trim16 (at LG5 and LG9) and trim24 (at LG6 and LG16) were detected in AS- and PD-resistance QTL. Recent studies have associated the tripartite motif family with resistance to the infectious salmon anaemia virus in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).48 Genes related to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway were identified in VHS- (pik3r, pik3c, adcy1; LG1) and PD- (pik3cg, adcy3; LG23) QTL. Recently, five genes belonging to this pathway were found to be associated with resistance to Flavobacterium columnare in catfish.49 Another interesting point is the high representation of proteasome and ubiquitin-related proteins in QTL related to resistance to the three pathogens [e.g. three copies of the proteasome subunit a type-6 (psma6) at several QTL], suggesting a potential role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the resistance, likely through the antigen presentation process.4. DiscussionThe turbot (S. maximus, Scophthalmidae) belongs to the order Pleuronectiformes, a group of fish with notable adaptations to demersal life and great commercial value. The turbot genome presented here (×219 sequence coverage; 95% of estimated genome size in scaffolds) represents one of the highest quality draft genomes among aquaculture species, very similar to that reported for tongue sole (C. semilaevis, Cynoglossidae; ×212).1 The estimated genome size of turbot (568 Mb) is very close to our previous estimation (600 Mb)50 and also very similar to that of tongue sole (male: 495 Mb; female: 545 Mb). Flatfish genomes are among the most compact fish genomes, and accordingly, the percentage of TEs (~5%) was slightly higher than pufferfish (~3%), the smallest reported vertebrate genome (~400 Mb).20Important genomic resources have also been reported in other farmed flatfish species of different families: halibut (Hipoglossus hipoglossus, Pleuronectidae), Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus; Paralichthyidae), and Senegalese and common soles (Solea senegalensis and S. solea; Soleidae), including genetic maps of medium–high-density applied for QTL screening, comprehensive transcriptomic and miRNA databases applied for gene expression evaluation, and ongoing whole genome projects.51 Pleuronectiformes represents along with Salmoniformes the fish order with the most genomic resources among aquaculture fish. The integration of all these data involving five of the principal flatfish families will help to improve production as well as facilitate the investigation of flatfish origin and adaptation to demersal life.Flatfish suffer a drastic environmental change from the pelagic larval stage up to juvenile and adult stages, living in the sea bottom at progressively higher depth. In addition to the particular metamorphosis changes from the bilateral symmetry to flat morphology common to all flatfish, other adaptations related to a new prey-spectrum, low light conditions, and a different microbiota environment need to be faced, and little information exists on the particular strategy developed by each flatfish species or family.Teleosts show a wide range of visual adaptations related to the wide environmental diversity they face. The whole genome duplication, which occurred early in the evolution of ray-finned fish, provided raw genetic material to refine gene functions. Hence, many teleost families have specialized their duplicated vision-related genes to adapt to their particular environment.52 Functional specialization of paralogues has occurred especially within the green-sensitive opsins related to low light environments.53 After the metamorphosis of Pleuronectiform fish, environmental light substantially changes from shorter to longer wavelengths. Although further research should be done, our data suggest an improved vision of turbot to adapt to benthic life supported by tandem gene duplications of some vision-related genes. The detected green-sensitive opsin duplications may be adjusted to different wavelengths as reported in tilapia53 or zebrafish54 to refine turbot vision in the low light conditions of the sea bottom. The presence of spectrally distinct visual pigments that provide diverse visual sensitivities, and the differential ontogenetic expression of the opsin genes in several fish species53,55,56 suggest the adaptation to different habitats during the fish life cycle. Additionally, the presence of multiple crystalline genes could improve the eye structure itself enhancing vision accuracy. These observations contrast with the decayed visual system reported in tongue sole suggested by the absence or pseudogenization of several crystalline genes and the absence of the green-sensitive opsin duplications observed in turbot.1 In tongue sole, adaptation to benthic life seems to have occurred by enhancing other sensorial alternatives, like the increased lateral-line sensitivity and species-specific sensory papillae.1 Genomic expansions have been reported in other genome projects relating to adaptation to particular lifestyles, as the expansion of stress-related genes in the oyster genome57 or osmo-regulatory genes in the sea bass genome.25Another important difference of turbot with tongue sole is related to the metabolic machinery involved in preventing oxidation of PUFA membrane lipids, which shows signals of gene expansion and positive selection in turbot. As increasing PUFA is the main adaptive response of poikilotherms to environmental cooling, these differences may be related to the colder and wider temperature range environment of turbot. While the optimal growth temperature of tongue sole is 22°C,58 it is 18°C for the turbot. Furthermore, turbot exhibits a high growth rate between 13 and 20°C,59 thus showing better adaptation not only to lower temperatures but also to temperature fluctuations. The same happens with cod, which, like turbot, harbours several copies of pla2 and gpx1, and lives at temperatures ranging from -1 to 20°C.60 Important changes necessary for adaptation to benthic lifestyle should be shared by Pleuronectiformes, especially if a monophyletic origin is true but, at the same time, a fast adaptive radiation occurring ~40 MYA may have contributed to the specific evolutionary history of each family or species.We also investigated the genomic architecture of three main productive traits (SD, growth, and resistance to pathogens) that are essential for understanding adaptation of turbot populations to environmental variation.3,39 The three can be considered complex traits but with notable architectural differences. While major genetic effects (SD master genes) and high heritabilities are involved in SD,30 moderate heritabilities and more widespread, although sometimes important, genetic effects have been documented for BW and length, and usually low heritabilities and widespread minor genetic factors for disease resistance traits, although with notable exceptions.38Nearly, all selected candidate genes for the three investigated traits (>1,000) were found in the turbot genome and most of them predictively mapped. Only two genes, one related to meiosis triggering (stra8) and another one to a key immune pathway (tlr4) were missing. This observation is consistent with similar information in other teleosts which indicates alternative pathways to cover these functions and highlights the functional diversification of teleosts.An important dispersion of candidate genes and QTL was detected in the turbot genome for the three traits in accordance with their complex condition. However, relevant gene clusters were identified for the three traits associated to specific QTL. These regions were also detected in other fish and vertebrate species, supporting their relevance and trans-specific conservation.4 Also, some genes or gene families were associated with resistance QTL for different pathogens, evidencing their generalist component, and making them essential in order to get more robust broodstock through marker-assisted selection programmes. Finally, processes related to growth, immunity, and gonadal differentiation overlapped at the same genomic regions, denoting genetic correlations between different traits, either positive or negative, an issue of major productive importance.5. ConclusionThe genome sequence of turbot (S. maximus) we report here represents an important contribution to understand the organization and evolution of fish genomes. This genome is among those with highest coverage within fish, similar to that of the tongue sole, and among the most compact ones within vertebrates. The integration of the turbot genetic and physical maps and their comparison with model fish genomes provide powerful tools for future studies in turbot, fish and vertebrates. Our in silico analysis of the turbot genome has permitted to advance interesting hypotheses on flatfish adaptation and diversification to cope with demersal life challenges. Finally, this genome has shed light on the genetic basis of relevant productive traits, and represents a milestone for boosting turbot production through more efficient marker-assisted selection programmes.Data availabilitySequencing data are available in the ENA with the following study accession: PRJEB11743.Authors’ contributionsA.F. and P.M. organized the work and built up the consortium.

We validated TetRP by confirming the translation start sites of protein-coding genes in accordance with the 2006 version of Escherichia coli K-12 annotation record (GenBank U00096.2) and found ~150 new start sites within 60 nucleotides of the annotated site. This analysis revealed 72 per cent of the genes whose initiation site annotations were changed from the 2006 GenBank record to the newer 2014 annotation record (GenBank U00096.3), indicating a high sensitivity. Also, results from reporter fusion and proteomics of N-terminally enriched peptides showed high specificity of the TetRP results. In addition, we discovered over 300 translation start sites within non-coding, intergenic regions of the genome, using a threshold that retains ~2,000 known coding genes. While some appear to correspond to pseudogenes, others may encode small peptides or have previously unforeseen roles. In summary, we showed that ribosome profiling upon translation inhibition by tetracycline offers a simple, reliable and comprehensive experimental tool for precise annotation of translation start sites of expressed genes in bacteria.","Tetracycline-inhibited ribosome profiling (TetRP) provides a powerful new experimental tool for comprehensive genome-wide identification of translation initiation sites in bacteria. We validated TetRP by confirming the translation start sites of protein-coding genes in accordance with the 2006 version of Escherichia coli K-12 annotation record (GenBank U00096.2) and found ~150 new start sites within 60 nucleotides of the annotated site. This analysis revealed 72 per cent of the genes whose initiation site annotations were changed from the 2006 GenBank record to the newer 2014 annotation record (GenBank U00096.3), indicating a high sensitivity. Also, results from reporter fusion and proteomics of N-terminally enriched peptides showed high specificity of the TetRP results. In addition, we discovered over 300 translation start sites within non-coding, intergenic regions of the genome, using a threshold that retains ~2,000 known coding genes. While some appear to correspond to pseudogenes, others may encode small peptides or have previously unforeseen roles. In summary, we showed that ribosome profiling upon translation inhibition by tetracycline offers a simple, reliable and comprehensive experimental tool for precise annotation of translation start sites of expressed genes in bacteria.1. IntroductionRecent advances in DNA sequencing has permitted rapid determination of the complete genomes of thousands of bacteria.1 Computational analyses of these genomes by ORF scan and homology to known genes have greatly facilitated the annotation of protein-coding genes.2 However, precise identification of the N-termini of ORFs has proven to be difficult, as documented from the continuous re-annotation of Escherichia coli K-12. In early 2006, Riley et al.3 reported innumerable updates to gene annotations with 100 s of start site changes, which were supported by a variety of experimental, computational, and database resources. Yet, the 2014 E. coli K-12 MG1655 annotation record (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000913.3) included 223 start site changes from the 2006 GenBank record, including 133 new start sites for functional genes and 90 start sites for pseudogenes, which were compiled from various newer experimental results and by comparisons with related genomes.4Ribosome profiling (RP) is an application of high-throughput sequencing, in which mRNA protected from RNase digestion by bound ribosomes is used as the source of the sequence library and consequent identification of translated regions of expressed genes.5–7 Indeed, RP has provided a wealth of data on translation efficiency,5,8 while also changing our understanding of translational control and revealing unexpected translated regions such as upstream micro ORFs and N-terminal identifications.9,10 However, RP has not been sufficient for precise identification of translation start sites, at least not in bacteria.With the goal towards describing translation efficiency in E. coli, we conducted RP in the presence of the translation inhibitors chloramphenicol (Cm) and tetracycline (Tet),11 which were chosen because they inhibit translation differently.12,13 Cm blocks translation elongation by targeting the peptidyl transferase centre on the large ribosomal subunit while Tet inhibits translation by preventing the stable binding of tRNA to the ribosome by directly overlapping with the anticodon stem-loop of tRNA at A-site. While Cm and Tet produced similar RP patterns within central regions of protein-encoding genes, they produced dramatically different patterns near known translation start sites. Importantly, Cm produced broad high-density peaks from the initiation codon to ~50 nucleotides downstream of the coding region, while Tet produced an RP pattern in which nearly one-half of the signal was sharply concentrated at the location where the initiation codon was at P-site of the ribosome, corresponding to the location of the translating initiation complex.11 These results suggested the hypothesis that Tet-inhibited RP (TetRP) may be a powerful new tool for comprehensive and precise identification of translation start sites in bacteria.Here we validated the usefulness of TetRP for experimental determination of translation start sites and identification of previously unknown translated regions. Results from analysing our TetRP data11 confirmed the utility of TetRP for defining functional translation initiation codons.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and culture conditionsEscherichia coli K-12 BW25113 and its derivatives14,15 were used throughout. LB medium16 and LB agar were used as rich media. Glucose MOPS medium17 prepared as described18 was used as minimal medium.2.2. Ribosome profile data used and data processingThe ribosome profile dataset used here has been published11 and is available at DDBJ as BioProject ID:PRJDB2960. In brief, samples were taken from glucose-limited continuous cultures of E. coli K-12 BW25113 and its smpB deletion mutant14 in glucose MOPS medium after 30 s treatment with Cm (100 µg/ml) or Tet (40 µg/ml). RP following treatment with clindamycin (10 µg/ml; clindamycin hydrochloride monohydrate, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Japan) and pactamycin (5 µg/ml, Sigma) were similarly performed using an E. coli K-12 BW25113 tolC mutant,14 which is more sensitive to these antibiotics.19,20Because the sequence libraries were constructed by adding polyA to the 3'-ends of the short RNA fragments produced with RNase I, the polyA sequences were computationally eliminated using fastx_clipper in the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html, accessed 27 February 2016) and mapped to the E. coli K-12 genome (GenBank: U00096.2) using bowtie.21 Number of reads mapped to coding region was about one to a few million (Supplementary Table S1). Mapped length of reads distributes mainly from 25 to 50 nucleotides, due to size selection of digested mRNA fragments by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.11 The length distribution of TetRP reads mapped to CDS, indicating protected length by ribosome, is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. To compare the read depth at each genomic position, the mapping information of each read was used to summarize the read depth at each position on both strands. For precise mapping, positions corresponding to 3' ends of reads were used for calculation. The read depth was normalized between samples by defining the average depth over the entire coding region as one; the resultant depth was used as the signal strength at each position. Because 3' adenines were removed during data processing, reads ending before and after a 3' adenine were counted as the same position, depth at this position was used for both positions. While this process reduced resolution, we found this step was a reasonable solution for purposes of data analysis.11 Though the protected length by ribosome ranges mainly from 25 to 50 nucleotides in the datasets, our previous analyses showed that it extends 12- to 13-nt in the 3'-direction from the first base of A-site codon but various lengths in the 5'-direction;11 thus, an average read depth over 15- to 16-nt 3' was used as the signal to identify codons starting from a specific genome position.2.3. Screening new translation start sites of known coding genesIn-frame NTG codons <60-nt 5' from the initiating codon of coding genes3 were listed, and signal ratio of the codon to the corresponding new start codon was calculated after addition of 0.5 to both values to avoid division by zero. Candidates for alternate start codons were then selected as described in Results.2.4. Construction of ß-galactosidase gene fusions to confirm new translation start sitesThe modified lacZ DNA gene behind the lacUV5 promoter without an operator from pKK232-Z (GGA)22,23 was replaced with the lacZ alpha region from the low copy number plasmid pMW228 (Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Tokyo), to construct the low copy number plasmid pMW-base-lacZ, which expresses lacZ constitutively. For this, PCR fragments were generated using pMW228 and pKK232-Z(GGA) as templates and primers XbaI-pMW218-1874R ccttctagACAGCTTTGAATGCACCAAA with XhoI-pMW218-2570F ctcctcgagTTTCTCATAGCTCACGCTGT, and XbaI-TP17-F ccttctagAATTCAGCCCGCCTAATGAG with XhoI-rrnBterm ctcctcgagTGCTTTCCTGATGCAAAAAC, respectively, digested with XbaI and XhoI and ligated. lacZ gene fusions were made by replacing DNA from the BamHI site downstream of the lacZ transcription start site to 6th codon of lacZ with the test sequence (Supplementary Fig. S2). To confirm translation was initiated from the test sequence, the central base of either or both possible translation start codons in the region were changed from T to C. All segments generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the relevant regions in the respective plasmids.2.5. ß-galactosidase assaysEscherichia coli K-12 BW25113 harboring each plasmid was grown aerobically in minimal medium containing 0.4% glucose and 25 µg/ml ampicillin to 0.5 OD660 as measured with a digital spectrophotometer (miniphoto 518R, Taitec Corp, Japan). Cultures were cooled on ice and assayed for ß-galactosidase as described.24 Averages and standard deviations from triplicated cultures were determined.2.6. Proteomics of N-terminal peptidesEscherichia coli K-12 BW25113 was grown to mid-log phase in LB broth with vigorous shaking at 37°C. Six replicated cultures were analysed as follows. Cells were collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in buffer containing 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.0), 12 mM sodium deoxycholate, and 12 mM sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. The protein crude extract was treated by reductive dimethylation followed by trypsin digestion. Protein N-terminal peptides were enriched by COFRADIC25 and desalted with a SDB-XC StageTip (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan).NanoLC-MS/MS analyses were performed on TripleTOF 5600 (AB SCIEX) system, connected to a Thermofisher Scientific UltiMate 3000 pump (Germering, Germany) and a HTC-PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics). Peptides were separated in a self-pulled needle column (150 mm length × 100 µm ID, 6 µm opening) packed with Reprosil-C18 3 µm reversed-phase material (Dr Maisch GmbH, Germany). The mobile phases consisted of (A) 0.5% acetic acid and (B) 0.5% acetic acid and 80% acetonitrile. A three-step linear gradient of 5–10% B in 5 min, 10–40% B in 60 min, 40–100% B in 5 min, and 100% B for 10 min was employed. The mass scan ranges were m/z 300–1,500, and top 10 precursor ions were selected in each MS scan for subsequent MS/MS scans.Peptides and proteins were identified by automated database searching using Mascot v2.3 (Matrix Science, London, UK) with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.1 Da, and strict trypsin specificity allowing for two missed cleavages. The protein database searched was produced from the 2006 E. coli K-12 MG1665 genome record,3 with or without an update from the TetRP results. Peptides were considered identified if the Mascot score was over the 95% confidence limit (P < 0.05) for each peptide. False discovery rate was set to be 1% at peptide level.2.7. Screening for new translation start sites within intergenic regionsATG codons outside coding regions, excluding ones <30-nt from the 5'-end of coding regions (betMet), were selected from the 2006 E. coli K-12 annotation3 and used to identify possible new start sites as described in Results.2.8. Construction of genomic Venus fusions to intergenic regionsVenus fusions to predicted intergenic coding regions were made by replacing the termination codon of the targeted ORF with a DNA fragment containing Venus (without a start codon) and chloramphenicol resistance (cat) gene by <U+03BB> Red-mediated recombination.15 The Venus-cat template plasmid was made by inserting the Venus coding region26 into pKD3.15 DNA sequences of the template and PCR primers are in Supplementary Fig. S3.2.9. Flow cytometryGenomic Venus fusion strains were grown in glucose minimum medium to 0.3 OD600 or LB broth overnight and subjected to flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson) as described elsewhere.273. Results3.1. Different patterns of Tet- and Cm-inhibited ribosome profilingIn an earlier study, we found huge differences in RP read patterns between samples from Cm- and Tet-treated cultures. Whereas Cm-inhibited RP (CmRP) patterns show signals distributed to all coding regions, TetRP patterns have sharp peaks at translational initiation sites (Fig. 1a). At around initiating sites, Cm-inhibited RP (CmRP) patterns show broad high-density reads from the initiating codon to ~50 nucleotides downstream of the coding region, instead TetRP patterns have peaks at positions where the initiating codon is at the ribosome P-site (Fig. 1b and c).11 Although the mechanism responsible for these differences is not well understood, the characteristic RP pattern from TetRP samples led us to propose the hypothesis that TetRP may be useful for identification of translational start sites in bacteria, which we tested as described below. Difference in TetRP and CmRP signal patterns. (a) TetRP and CmRP patterns of a ribosomal protein operon. TetRP (Black) and CmRP (light gray) patterns over an operon coding ribosomal proteins are shown. Location of each gene is shown by an arrow. (b) CmRP and (c) TetRP patterns near 5' end of coding region of genes. Genes longer than 500-bp were selected, and read depths from -5 to +495 from the first base of initiation codon were normalized to an average value of the region, then the depth of all genes was averaged. Results from three independent cultures are shown in different colours. (d, e) Relative TetRP signal distribution at in-frame ATG codons near initiation codons of known genes is compared with signals at the corresponding initiation codon. (d) Median and (e) average signals at a position from three samples were used for calculation. Median, upper and lower quartiles of all ATG codons at indicated distances are boxed. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Difference in TetRP and CmRP signal patterns. (a) TetRP and CmRP patterns of a ribosomal protein operon.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We initially tested our TetRP hypothesis by comparing TetRP reads at initiating codons with RP reads at nearby in-frame AUG codons (alt-AUG) in known coding genes. Figure 1d and e shows the ratio (reads at alt-AUG codons)/(reads at corresponding initiating codons) against the relative position to the initiating codon. Results showed that read depths at initiating codons were >10-fold higher than at most distal positions. Differences were less at closer positions, and depths at +1 positions (the second codon following the initiating codons) were almost the same as at the initiating codon, possibly due to functioning of alternative initiating codons, the limits of resolution of our data, or both.3.2. Re-mapping start sites of known E. coli protein-encoding genesBased on the results above, we attempted to re-annotate the starts of all coding genes, noting that by nature RP data pertain only to genes expressed under experimental growth conditions. We did this by comparing our results with the 2006 annotation record of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome (GenBank U00096.2), but excluding pseudogenes and IS genes.3 By comparing read depth at initiating codons with nearby (<60-nt) in-frame NUG codons, we selected 177 (1.2% of 17,319) possible alternative initiating (alt-init) codons, which showed higher read depth in two of three samples (median =1) and =10-fold higher read depth on average. These 177 sites correspond to 165 genes, including 10 genes with 2 new start site candidates and 1 gene with 3 start site candidates. Also, 11 alt-init sites lying upstream of the 2006 annotated site have in-frame stop codons preceding the annotated initiating codon. The remaining 154 genes are listed as alt-init codon(s) in Supplementary Table S2.We next compared the TetRP data with the 2014 E. coli K-12 MG1655 annotation record (GenBank U00096.3), which was released while this study was in progress. The 2014 GenBank record has 95 genes with re-annotated start sites within our search range, including 63 that match our TetRP results (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3); 5 other genes have new start sites by our analyses, which differ from the re-annotated start sites. Figure 3 shows the read depth near the start sites of these 5 genes. Inspection of the signal at three possible initiating sites show that the major signals for ycjY, icdC, yciX (ymiA), and tfaS are at the start site that we mapped and little signal lies at start sites in the 2006 and 2014 E. coli K-12 MG1655 annotation records. For rfaB, the sites from both the TetRP results and the 2014 annotation show signals. An additional strong signal exists near the 2014 rfaB annotated site, indicating that its major initiation site is at this site.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We similarly investigated 27 genes whose start sites were changed from the 2006 to 2014 annotation records and were not revealed by our initial analyses (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S3). Upon manual inspection, we found that 12 have reads only at the 2014 annotation start sites. We failed to find these initially due to variability among the triplicate samples. Five have signals only at the 2006 annotation start sites, supporting the validity of our analyses for these genes. Six have signals at both the 2006 and 2014 annotation start sites, suggesting alternative start sites function for these genes. Four have no signal at either start site.Of the 9 cases where the 2006 to 2014 annotation changes did not match with our analysis (marked *1 and *2 in Fig. 2), two revisions of the 2014 record were made based on proteomics data. In yciX (ymiA), a peptide not expected from 2006 annotation was found,28 but which can be derived from proteins initiated from the 2014 annotation and TetRP site. Accordingly, we were unable to determine whether the 2014 or TetRP site is correct from the peptide data. For trpC, an N-terminal peptide corresponding only to the 2014 annotation was found,28 contrary to our finding that little TetRP signal was at this site. In seven other cases, the 2006 to 2014 revision appears to have no experimental support (Supplementary Table S3). Thus, excluding these 8 of 9 cases, our TetRP analyses agree with 72% [63/(95 - 8)] of the start sites re-annotated from 2006 to 2014.We also closely inspected reads near the initiation sites of 87 genes for which we found new start sites and which were unchanged in the 2006–14 annotation records (Fig. 2). We removed 20 cases with one codon difference from these analyses, because the differences in the read depth between the initiation codon and an adjacent ATG codon were small (Fig. 1 d and e). We analysed the remaining 42 ATG, 10 GTG, 9 TTG, and 6 CTG new start sites (Supplementary Fig. S5). Of these 67 cases, 39 (27 ATG, 4 GTG, and 8 TTG) have clear signals mainly at the new start sites; 22 (14 ATG, 5 GTG, and 3 CTG) have signals at both the original and the newly annotated sites (Supplementary Table S2); and 6 cases were inconclusive due to weak signal or broad signal distribution near the initiation site(s). For two genes (ymdC and surE), we were unable to ascertain whether the signal near the start sites was real due to overlap of the initiation sites by coding regions of strongly expressed upstream genes. Accordingly, 39–61 (39 + 22) of these 67 genes appear to initiate from the newly identified start sites. Our data not only show high validity but also reveal many genes with dual translation initiation sites.3.3. Use of ß-galactosidase gene fusions to confirm new translation start sitesIt is notable that we found 9 new UUG start sites, as only 81 UUG start codons had been previously annotated.3 We therefore confirmed several new minor initiation codons (6 UUG and 1 GUG) by comparing their ability to initiate translation with the originally annotated AUG codon by using lacZ reporter gene fusions. To do this, we made a series of lacZ fusions to DNA fragments containing both the original and newly identified initiating codons plus 15-nt 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences to lacZ without a start codon, in which expression was driven by the lacUV5 promoter on a low copy number plasmid (Supplementary Fig. S2). We then destroyed either or both initiating codons by mutating its second position T (U) to C. The amounts of ß-galactosidase made by the resultant constructs are in Fig. 4. Results show that in four of seven cases (ftsH, potA, rfaQ, and yedI) elimination of the new start site (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 4) has a greater effect on reducing ß-galactosidase levels than alteration of the original start codon, indicating more efficient translation from the new start codon. In the case of yigE, removal of original (upper) initiating codon has a larger effect. However, examination of yigE transcription in the culture used for RP revealed that transcription initiates between the original and newly annotated start sites; thus, the start site showing higher translation for the lacZ fusion is not used in the genome context (Fig. 4 lower right panel). We were unable to draw a definitive conclusion for two genes because (i) the ß-galactosidase levels were too low in all cases for ybjO fusions (data not shown) or (ii) the trkG fusion unexpectedly showed the highest level in the construct in which both initiation codons altered (Fig. 4). Thus, five of the seven cases, including 4 with UUGs, indicated higher translation for the newly annotated codon than the original AUG codon, while one case (yigE) was true only in its genomic context. Our data show that these non-ATG codons function efficiently. It is notable that our newly found UUG start site for ftsH had been previously reported,29,30 but it had not been included in the 2006 nor 2014 GenBank annotation records. ß-Galactoside activity from lacZ reporter gene fusions.

Confirmation of the new translational initiation start sites with proteomicsWe also used proteomics to confirm the newly annotated start sites by selectively enriching N-terminal peptides after tryptic digestion and LC-MS identification of peptides. In this analysis, we found N-terminal peptides corresponding to 910 proteins of the 4,300 total known coding genes, including N-terminal peptides for 19 of the 154 genes with new start sites, counting peptides starting with the initiating methionine or the second amino acid (Supplementary Table S4). We also found N-terminal peptides for 8 of these 154 genes corresponding to the 2006 annotation. Importantly, we found two N-terminal peptides for 5 genes, including one corresponding to our new start site and the other corresponding to the 2006 annotation start site. Peptides corresponding to the new site were found more frequently in four cases, indicating dual translation initiation sites and more efficient translation at the new site. Our discovery rate of 12 per cent (19 N-terminal peptides for 154 genes) is significantly lower (P < 0.5) when compared with 21 per cent (910 N-terminal peptides for 4,300 genes) for total proteins. However, considering 60% specificity will result in similar discovery rates indicated good accuracy of our analysis.3.5. Identification of intergenic translation start sitesHaving shown TetRP to be an accurate and reliable tool for identification of translation start sites of known genes, we sought to identify translated regions within intergenic (non-coding) regions of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome in the 2006 GenBank record. We examined reads at 14,942 ATGs between intergenic regions, denoted betMet, excluding ATGs within 30-nt of known start sites, as potential alternative translation initiation sites. We selected intergenic start sites by TetRP signal strength at a threshold of average - standard deviation in log (TetRP signals) of known start sites (initMets), but not using those with no signal. This led to keeping 2,588 of 4,310 initMets but only 409 of the 14,942 betMets (Supplementary Fig. S6a). We then used the TetRP/CmRP ratio at a threshold, keeping 80% (2,071) of the remaining initMets, and selected 360 betMets as candidates for intergenic translation start sites (Supplementary Fig. S6b and Table S5). These 360 intergenic start sites include 27 that were in the 2014 GenBank annotation record (Supplementary Table S5), including 18 newly annotated protein-coding genes, 5 pseudogenes, and 4 new start sites of known genes. We also identified 5 others as new start sites of known genes. Thus, 328 may function as start sites of novel intergenic translation units. As expected from their intergenic locations, most predicted coding regions are short: only 16 are predicted to encode >50 amino acid residues and 80% encode fewer than 24 residues (Supplementary Fig. S6c).3.6. Use of genomic Venus fusions to confirm translation initiation of newly discovered small ORFsTo test newly identified intergenic start sites for function in their native genomic context, we constructed a series of Venus (bright yellow fluorescent protein: Ref. 26) gene (translation) fusions to the 3'-end of selected ORFs by recombining a Venus-cat cassette into the genome as shown in Fig. 5 (upper panel). We chose five small ORFs including yciY (from the 2014 annotation4,31) for analysis, which we named IVP1, 3 (yciY), 4, 6, and 7 (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S7). We also chose two intergenic ORFs with ATGs with lower TetRP signal (IVP2 and 5) than selected, but located 7- and 10-nt from IVP1 and IVP4, respectively, to check the resolution of our analysis. Our flow cytometry data for these strains and a control wild type without Venus are in Fig. 5. On the one hand, in LB medium three of four and in minimal medium two of four fusions to these ORFs produced expression levels similar to the IVP3 (yciY) fusion, indicating that these start sites are functional. On the other hand, the IVP2 and IVP5 fusions showed lower fluorescence in both medium than IVP1 and IVP4, respectively, indicating that TetRP reads can discriminate sites separated by 10 or fewer nt. Expression of small (s)ORF-Venus fusion in genomic context. Upper panel: Expression pattern of the sORF in wild type and structure of the fusion gene. TetRP (red, mapped location of 3'-end of sequence reads), CmRP, and transcription (blue and black, respectively; all sequence reads mapped) signals are shown with the location of sRNA and flanking genes. Venus and cat DNA cassette was inserted at the 3' end of sORF as described in Materials and Methods. Lower panels: Fluorescence from the Venus fusion protein in each strain is shown following growth on LB or glucose minimal medium, as indicated. Fluorescence from wild type lacking Venus was used as background. Signal from positive control (IVP3, yciY) is in red, and negative controls (IVP2 and 5) are in black.

DiscussionWe showed that TetRP is a reliable experimental tool for comprehensive and precise identification of translation start sites for expressed genes in E. coli. It is especially notable that TetRP revealed >70% of start site changes in the latest (2014) GenBank annotation record, which included many sites manually compiled from a number of individual experimental studies in addition to ones identified by homology to closely related genomes,4 while also producing a low false discovery rate. The high sensitivity and specificity of finding working initiation sites based on existing annotation data shows TetRP to be reliable for validation of correct translation start sites, following standard gene annotation steps of ORF scan and homology searching.RP following treatment with translation inhibitors has been previously used to identify translation initiation sites in eukaryotes,10,32 but not in bacteria. We tested several antibiotics in addition to Cm and Tet and found two others (clindamycin and pactamycin) that showed similar initiation site patterns as Tet (Supplementary Fig. S8). Since pactamycin is believed to inhibit the first translocation from initiation complex,12 emergence of initiation site-specific RP pattern for pactamycin is expected. However, clindamycin and Tet inhibit translation elongation by binding to 50S subunit to inhibit peptidyl transferase reaction and to 30S subunit to block aminoacyl-tRNA entry, respectively.12,33,34 More information on the mode of action is required to understand the basis of the observed initiation site-specific RP patterns. Irrespective of full understanding, three antibiotics are applicable for identification of translation start sites, though Tet is generally more suitable considering its broad specificity and availability.12 As described herein, the resolution of TetRP in this report was somewhat limited by the addition of polyA to short RNAs prior to reverse transcription during the construction of sequencing libraries, which led to an ambiguity of the 3'-end positions and required sequencing in the 5' to 3' direction with respect to the RNA to find 3'-ends.11 While we used this method to avoid quantitative bias in RNA sequencing,5 the use of adapter ligation to 3'-ends of short RNA for library construction and sequencing in the 3' to 5' direction of the RNA would be useful to enhance resolution.With regards to genome annotation of E. coli K-12, results in this work are important not only because we found many new N-termini of known proteins in the extensively re-annotated 2014 GenBank record annotation,4,35 but also because we uncovered multiple translation initiation sites for many genes. We identified 28 genes with two initiation sites by TetRP, including 5 proteins with two start sites by N'-proteomics. Although, only a few cases had been found in E. coli,36,37 proteins with multiple start sites may be more prevalent than previously had been thought. Our results from testing alternate initiation codons by constructing ß-galactosidase gene fusions also showed that in most cases constructs lacking either initiation codon retained some activity while constructs lacking both codons showed lowest activity (Fig. 3), which also suggests functioning of multiple initiation codons. These genes may change the major translation initiation site in response to cellular environments or signals, and TetRP can be a useful means to globally investigate mechanisms of how cells select translation initiation site.We also found evidence for >300 new translation units without using homology or ORF scan information. Some such ORFs are likely to have function like other small proteins recently found in the cell membrane38,39 or are pseudogene fragments like ones that have already been included in the 2014 E. coli K-12 GenBank record (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000913.3). However, it is difficult to infer how many of the 328 new intergenic translation units have biological function. Though TetRP signal strength of these possible initiation sites are generally similar with the known initiation sites, many weak sites may result from low level infidelity of ribosomes binding to RNA and the high sensitivity of TetRP to detect such binding sites. For example, we recently uncovered thousands of previously undocumented transcription start sites in E. coli K-12 by strand-specific RNA-seq,40 many of which are antisense to coding regions. Whether these have biological roles or correspond to genomic ‘dark matter’ is unknown.41 In support of this notion, we found that the length distribution of ORFs from the intergenic start sites was similar to the length distribution of all ORFs within intergenic regions or ORFs randomly produced by the genetic code (Supplementary Fig. S6c). Accordingly, peptides produced by these new initiation sites appear not to have been selected by their function. It is also notable that the portion of very short ORFs (<9 residues) is higher in the selected ORFs than in the random or total ORF sets. Especially, the portion of single-codon ORFs, i.e. ones with a start codon followed immediately by a stop codon was higher in the selected ORFs. Translation of the detected small intergenic ORFs may have biological function even if the translation product has no function. Ribosome binding or translation of short ORFs may have key gene regulatory roles in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.42–45 Yet, many of the intergenic translation initiation sites were not obviously related to nearby coding genes, though ribosome binding to such RNAs may affect its function by changing its structure or stability.46FundingThis work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (20310117 and 24310148 to K.N.), (A) (25250028 to H.M.), and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (26116717 to H.M and K.N.); the National Science Foundation (106394 to B.L.W.); and a co-operative research grant of the Genome Research for Bioresource, NODAI Genome Research Center, Tokyo University of Agriculture.

IntroductionGene expression has been intensively studied with the relatively new tools provided by fluorescent proteins and microscopy techniques with single-molecule resolution, in both prokaryotic1–5 and eukaryotic6,7 systems. These studies have established that this process cannot be fully characterized by the mean protein production rate,8–12 since cells exhibit fluctuations (i.e. noise) over time and diversity in numbers across populations,13 which, among other things, generates phenotypic diversity.8 The noise has generally been investigated through indirect means, such as by observing the diversity in RNA and protein numbers in cell populations.2,3,10,11,14 Other, more direct means consist of observing the distribution of intervals between RNA productions2,4,5 and between protein bursts in individual cells.3,15From these observations, a wide range of gene expression behaviours have been reported and, therefore, significantly different probabilistic models of transcription have been proposed.2,4,16–18 In general, higher-than-Poissonian variability in RNA numbers has been explained by models in which the promoter intermittently switched into an inactive state, resulting in bursty RNA production dynamics.2,16,19 Meanwhile, lower-than-Poissonian variability appears to be more consistent with models assuming multiple rate-limiting steps.4,5,16,20,21There is direct experimental evidence for the existence of both mechanisms. Recently, Chong et al.19 showed that bursts of RNA production can emerge due to positive supercoiling build-up on a DNA segment, which eventually stops transcription initiation for a short period until the release of the supercoiling by gyrase. On the other hand, the existence of rate-limiting steps was established by studies using steady-state assays.22–24 Also, more recently, by fitting a monotone piecewise-constant function to the fluorescence signal from MS2-GFP tagged RNAs in individual cells, it was shown that in vivo RNA production can be a sub-Poissonian process.4,5,20,21Recent studies have considered the possibility that both mechanisms can be present in a single promoter.16,25 In ref. 25, a model including both mechanisms was proposed, and statistical methods were developed to select the relevant components and estimate the kinetics of the intermediate steps in initiation based on empirical data. However, this method cannot distinguish the order of the steps which occur after the start of transcription initiation, nor can it determine their reversibility, which recent evidence suggests may play a significant role in the dynamics of RNA production.26A complete model for transcription in prokaryotes must account, apart from the genome-wide variability in noise levels,17,27,28 for the well-established genome-wide variability in mean transcription rate2,3,8 and in fold change (ratio of production rate between zero and full induction)29 in response to induction found, e.g. in Escherichia coli promoters. For example, in vitro measurements on fully induced variants of the lar promoter showed that the mean interval between transcription events of these variants differs by hundreds of seconds.29 Promoters also differ widely in range of induction, even when differing only by a couple of nucleotides.29,30 For example, while PlarS17 has an induction range of 500 fold, PlarconS17 has an induction range of 4.5-fold, even though it only differs by 3 point mutations.29 This wide behavioural diversity is likely made possible by the sequence dependence of each step in transcription initiation.29Thus far, the strategies used in vitro to characterize the kinetics of the steps involved in transcription initiation22,26 have not been applied in vivo since they rely on measuring transcription for different RNA polymerase (RNAp) concentrations. Such a change in cells is expected to have a multitude of unforeseen effects31 (in addition to the side effects of the means used to alter RNAp concentrations), which hampers the assessment of its consequences to the duration of the closed complex formation of a specific promoter. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that, for certain small ranges of RNAp concentrations, these side effects will be negligible and thus, in such ranges, the inverse of the rate of transcription will be linear with respect to the inverse of the free RNAp concentration.Importantly, in E. coli, RNAp concentrations have been shown to vary widely with differing growth conditions.32 As such, here we make use of different media richness to achieve different RNAp concentrations and test whether within this range of conditions, the RNA production rate changes hyperbolically with the RNAp concentrations (i.e. if the inverse of this rate changes linearly with the inverse of the RNAp concentration). Having established this relationship, we make use of it to study the in vivo kinetics of transcription initiation of Plac/ara-1. In particular, we perform measurements of the time intervals between RNA productions at the single molecule level in different intracellular RNAp and inducer concentration conditions, which we use to derive a more detailed model of transcription initiation of Plac/ara-1. For this, we first extrapolate the mean interval between production events to the limit of infinite RNAp concentration, so as to estimate the in vivo durations of the open and closed complex formations of this promoter. Next, we examine the significance of an intermittent inactive promoter state, and the role of LacI in the emergence of this state. Finally, for the first time in vivo, we determine the reversibility of the closed complex formation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cells and plasmidsFor single-cell RNAp fluorescence measurements, we used E. coli W3110 and RL1314,33 generously provided by Robert Landick, University of Wisconsin-Madison. For single-cell transcription interval measurements, we used E. coli DH5a-PRO (generously provided by Ido Golding, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston). The strain information is: deoR, endA1, gyrA96, hsdR17(rK- mK+), recA1, relA1, supE44, thi-1, <U+0394>(lacZYA-argF)U169, F80dlacZ<U+0394>M15, F-, <U+03BB>-, PN25/tetR, PlacIq/lacI and SpR. This strain contains two constructs: a high-copy reporter plasmid vector PROTET-K133 (carrying MS2d-GFP under the control of PLtetO-1) and a single-copy plasmid vector pIG-BAC carrying the target transcript (mRFP1 followed by 96 MS2-binding sites) under the control of Plac/ara-1.2 This promoter is located approximately 2 and 9 kb from the origin of replication (Ori2) and the plasmid size is 11.5 kb.2 This system has been used to measure the distribution of time intervals between RNA production events due to its ability to detect individual target RNA molecules consisting of numerous MS2 coat protein binding sites, which are rapidly bound by fluorescently tagged MS2 coat proteins. These can be seen as they are produced under a fluorescence microscope as fluorescent foci.2,4,5,20,21 Finally, we used the plasmid pAB332 carrying hupA-mCherry to visualize nucleoids (generously provided by Nancy Kleckner, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA). For our measurements, we inserted this plasmid into DH5a-PRO cells so as to detect nucleoids in individual cells during the live cell microscopy sessions. HupA is a major nucleoid associated protein (NAP) that participates in its structural organization.342.2. ChemicalsThe components of Lysogeny Broth (LB) were purchased from LabM (UK), and antibiotics from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). For RT-PCR, cells were <U+FB01>xed with RNAprotect bacteria reagent (Qiagen, USA). Tris and EDTA for lysis buffer were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and lysozyme from Fermentas (USA). The total RNA extraction was done with RNeasy RNA puri<U+FB01>cation kit (Qiagen). DNase I, RNasefree for RNA puri<U+FB01>cation, was purchased from Promega (USA). iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for cDNA synthesis and iQ SYBR Green supermix for RT-PCR were purchased from Biorad (USA). Agarose, isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), arabinose, and anhydrotetracycline (aTc) are from Sigma-Aldrich.2.3. Growth mediaTo achieve different RNAp concentrations in cells, we altered their growth conditions as in.35 For this, we used modified LB media which differed in the concentrations of some of their components. The media used are denoted as m×, where the composition per 100 ml are: m grams of tryptone, m/2 gram of yeast extract and 1 g of NaCl (pH = 7.0). For example, 0.25× media has 0.25 g of tryptone and 0.125 g of yeast extract per 100 ml.2.4. Relative RNAp quantificationWe measured relative RNAp concentrations in cells using four different methods. First, relative RNAp concentrations in the strains W3110 and DH5a-PRO were measured from the relative rpoC transcript levels obtained using RT-PCR. Cells containing the target plasmid with Plac/ara-1-mRFP1-96BS and the reporter plasmids were grown overnight in respective media. Cells were diluted into fresh media to an OD600 of 0.05. After 110 min, cells were re-diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 into respective media containing IPTG (1 mM) and arabinose (1%). After 70 min, RNA protect reagent was added to fix the cells, followed by enzymatic lysis with Tris–EDTA lysozyme buffer (pH 8.3). RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). One microgram of RNA was used as the starting material. The RNA samples were treated with DNase free of RNase to remove residual DNA. Next, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using iSCRIPT reverse transcription super mix (Biorad). RT-PCR was performed using Power SYBR-green master mix (Life Technologies) with primers for the amplification of the target gene at a concentration of 200 nM. Reactions were carried out in triplicate with 500 nM per primer with a total reaction volume 20 µl. The following primers were used for quantification: RpoC-F: CGTCAGATGCTGCGTAAAGC, RpoC-R: GCGATCTTGACGCGAGAGTA, mRFP1-F: TACGACGCCGAGGTCAAG, mRFP1-R: TTGTGGGAGGTGATGTCCA. Estimated relative RNAp concentrations Rˆm in each condition m, and their standard uncertainties s(Rˆm)<U+2060>, were calculated according to the <U+0394>CT' method.36Second, E. coli RL1314 cells with fluorescently tagged ß' subunits were grown overnight in respective media. A pre-culture was prepared by diluting cells to an OD600 of 0.1 with fresh specific medium, and grown to an OD600 of 0.5 at 37°C at 250 rpm. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and re-suspended in saline. Fluorescence from the cell population was measured using a fluorescent plate-reader (Thermo Scienti<U+FB01>c Fluoroskan Ascent Microplate Fluorometer).Third, relative RNAp concentrations were also estimated based on the growth rates of DH5a-PRO cells in Supplementary Fig. S1. First, we fit a power law function to the ‘RNA polymerase molecules per cell’ row of Table 3 from ref. 32, which we found to be R=106µ-1.426, where µ is the cell doubling time. Relative RNAp concentrations were then estimated from the measured cell doubling times.Lastly, we measured the relative RNAp concentrations in RL1314 cells under the microscope using fluorescently tagged RpoC (described in the next section).2.5. MicroscopyDH5a-PRO cells containing the target and the reporter plasmids were grown as described previously. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in respective media, diluted into fresh media to an OD600 of 0.1, and allowed to grow to an OD600 of ~0.3. For the reporter plasmid induction, aTc (100 ng/ml) was added 1 h before the start of the measurements. For the target plasmid, arabinose (1%) was added at the same time as aTc (following the protocol in ref. 2), and IPTG (1 mM) was added 10 min before the start of the measurements. Cells were pelleted and resuspended to fresh medium. A few microliters of cells were placed between a coverslip and an agarose gel pad (2%), which contains the respective inducers, in a thermal imaging chamber (FCS2, Bioptechs), heated to 37°C. The cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse (Ti-E, Nikon, Japan) inverted microscope with a C2+ confocal laser-scanning system using a 100× Apo TIRF objective. Images were acquired using the Nikon Nis-Elements software. GFP <U+FB02>uorescence was measured using a 488 nm argon ion laser (Melles-Griot) and 514/30 nm emission <U+FB01>lter. Phase-contrast images were acquired with the external phase contrast system and a Nikon DS-Fi2 camera. Fluorescence images were acquired every 1 min for a total duration of 2 h. Phase-contrast images were acquired simultaneously every 5 min during the measurements.We tested for phototoxicity due to the fluorescence and the phase-contrast imaging in these measurements. Supplementary Results suggest that there is no significant phototoxicity. Additionally, we verified that the relative RNAp concentrations under the microscope are similar to those measured in the previous section by repeating the above procedure with RL1314 cells and imaging RpoC::GFP fluorescence, 1 h after being placed in the thermal imaging chamber (see Supplementary Fig. S4). The relative RNAp concentration was estimated from the mean fluorescence concentrations of cells growing in each media.2.6. Image analysisCells were detected from the phase contrast images as described in ref. 37. First, the images were temporally aligned using cross-correlation. Next, an automatic segmentation of the cells was performed by MAMLE,38 which was checked and corrected manually. Next, cell lineages were constructed by CellAging.39 Alignment of the phase-contrast images with the confocal images was done by manually selecting 5–7 landmarks in both images, and using thin-plate spline interpolation for the registration transform. Fluorescent spots and their intensities were detected from the confocal images using the Gaussian surface-fitting algorithm from.40Jumps were detected in each cell's spot intensity timeseries using a least-deviation jump-detection method.41 Given the level of noise in the timeseries, jump sizes, i.e. the intensity of ‘one RNA’, were selected by manual inspection of the timeseries of total foreground spot intensities within cells of a given timeseries, and cross-referencing these values with the observed numbers of spots in the cells. After performing the jump detection process making use of the complete timeseries, jumps occurring within 5 min of the beginning or end of a cell's lifetime were disregarded due to our observation that the jump detection method tends to produce spurious jumps in these regions due to insufficient data. The remaining jumps were interpreted as RNA production times, from which intervals between transcription events were calculated. Finally, censored intervals were calculated as the time from the last RNA production in a cell until the last time at which a jump could have been observed (i.e. until 5 min prior to cell division or the end of the timeseries). This removes the possibility of false positives while not affecting the distribution of intervals.This method, when first proposed, made two assumptions on the fluorescence of MS2-GFP tagged RNAs (named ‘spots’). Importantly, both assumptions were recently shown to be valid.42 First, an individual spot is bound sufficiently rapidly by MS2-GFPs such that its fluorescence intensity, when first detected, is already within the range of fluorescence of fully formed MS2-GFP-RNA spots (when taking one image per minute). In other words, the spot intensity of a newly transcribed RNA jumps from 0 to ‘full’ in <1 min, rather than slowly ramping up. Namely, since the transcription elongation rate of mRNA in E. coli is ~50 nt/s32 and the target gene is ~3,200 bp long,1 the time to elongate the MS2-binding site region of the target RNA is ~60 s. Provided that MS2-GFP binding to its RNA-binding sites is fast, there will therefore be a maximum of one timepoint at which the fully transcribed target RNA may have reduced fluorescence. Since MS2-GFP is produced in excess in the cell and its binding affinity is strong (dissociation constant of ~0.04 nM43), most binding sites will be saturated very shortly after being produced. In agreement with ref. 42, no gradual increase in spot fluorescence was observed around the time of the first appearance of a spot.Second, once formed, MS2-GFP-RNA spots, as well as their fluorescence, are resistant to degradation for the duration of our measurements (2 h). This was shown by measurements of the dissociation rate of MS2 coat proteins from their RNA binding sites (on the order of several hours43), and by measurements of the lifetimes of the fluorescence of MS2-GFP tagged RNAs kept under observation for more than 2 h.1,2,5,42,44 Relevantly, no detectable decrease in fluorescence was observed during this time.422.7. Model of transcription initiationWe first consider a model that allows for RNA production dynamics to range from sub-Poissonian to super-Poissonian, given the results from genome-wide studies of the variability in RNA numbers27,45 and from studies of the transcription dynamics of individual genes.2,4,5,17,20 The features of the model that allow it to reproduce these numbers are based on processes known to occur during transcription initiation in E. coli (e.g. the open complex formation16,22,23 and an ON/OFF mechanism16,19). Then, based on our novel empirical data and methodology, we aim to obtain the most parsimonious version of the model that fits the data for a given promoter. We expect this procedure to be applicable to any promoter, and to result in slightly different models due to their differing dynamics and regulatory mechanisms.Reaction (1) represents the multi-step process of transcription initiation of an active promoter in prokaryotes.23,24,46,47 It begins with the formation of the closed complex (RPc), i.e. the binding of the RNA polymerase (R) to a free promoter (PON). Once at the start site, the polymerase must open the DNA double helix, a process that includes several long-lived intermediate states,23,26,46,48 resulting in the open complex (RPo). Finally, the polymerase begins RNA elongation, though before clearing the promoter, it may engage in abortive RNA synthesis in which short RNA transcripts (<10 nt) are produced.47,49 The reactions in (1) should not be interpreted as elementary transitions. Rather, they represent the effective rates of the rate-limiting steps in the process, thus defining the promoter strength, and have been shown to be sequence-dependent.50Specifically, k1 represents the rate at which polymerases find and bind to the promoter region, which is the overall result of the promoter search process which includes non-specific binding of the polymerases to the DNA, followed by a 1D diffusive search,51,52 collectively referred to here as the closed complex formation. Subsequently, several rapid, possibly reversible isomerization reactions occur until the polymerase melts the DNA and forms the transcription ‘bubble’.51 In Reaction (1), the RPc state represents all substates until the first irreversible reaction in this chain. Consequently, k2 and k-1 should be interpreted as the product of the rates of the elementary reactions which exit from this group of substates, and the steady-state probability of being in the appropriate substates for these reactions to occur.Similarly, the RPo state may represent numerous substates between the first state after which the complex is committed to initiation, and successful initiation. However, after this point, we cannot distinguish the reversibility of any of the following steps, since the time-interval distribution of a sequence of elementary reversible reactions of arbitrary rates is observationally equivalent to a sequence of irreversible reactions.25 The remaining steps (here, only k3) therefore represent the rates of the slowest of these irreversible reactions. Such steps may include additional isomerization reactions, abortive RNA synthesis and promoter escape and clearance.35Reaction (2) represents the promoter intermittently transitioning to a transcriptionally inactive state (POFF). Experimentally verified mechanisms by which this can occur are the binding and unbinding of repressors and activators,29 the accumulation of positive supercoiling in the DNA.19 Additional mechanisms have also been hypothesized, such as transcriptional pausing53,54 and others.55It is noted that this model assumes that only one copy of the promoter is present in each cell at any given time. In the experiments performed here, in all conditions tested, the bacteria divided sufficiently slowly such that they spent most lifetime with only one chromosome. Specifically, cells spent no more than 11.4 ± 1.0% of their lifetime with two copies of the target promoter (Supplementary Material).Finally, it is noted that the present model does not consider the influence of s factors' numbers on the dynamics of transcription initiation, focussing instead solely on the concentration of RNA polymerases (in particular, on the concentration of holoenzymes containing a s70, i.e. Es70, since our promoter of interest can only be transcribed by Es70). This is based on the fact that, in all conditions tested, most RNA polymerases are occupied by s factors.56,57 Further, this occupation is made largely by s70 since, first, when altering media richness, only s32's concentration is significantly altered56 and, second, the binding affinity of s70 to E is much higher than that of any other s factor (e.g. it is approximately 9 times higher than that of s32).572.8. Parameter estimationParameter estimates in Tables 1–3 were obtained by a maximum likelihood fit using the samples of the distribution of time intervals between production events obtained above (the intervals and censored intervals), as in.25 The complete model-fitting procedure is detailed in the Supplementary Material. The uncertainty of the fit of the model parameters was estimated using the negative of the Hessian of the log-likelihood surface, evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimate. Statistics of the measured distributions of intervals between transcription events from lac/ara-1 promotersShown are the condition, the number of cells (which is the cell count at the start of the measurements), the numbers of whole and censored intervals extracted, and finally the inferred mean (and its standard uncertainty) and CV2 of the interval distribution.Statistics of the measured distributions of intervals between transcription events from lac/ara-1 promotersShown are the condition, the number of cells (which is the cell count at the start of the measurements), the numbers of whole and censored intervals extracted, and finally the inferred mean (and its standard uncertainty) and CV2 of the interval distribution.Fit parameters of the transcription initiation model in Reactions (1) and (2), and the models derived by applying the listed simplifying assumptionsParameters denoted ‘fast’ are too fast to present on the timescale of seconds.

Models with lower <U+0394>BIC are favoured over models with higher <U+0394>BIC.58Fit parameters of the transcription initiation model in Reaction (3) to the measured intervals in the 1× media with and without induction by IPTGThe relationship between these parameters and the parameters in Table 2 are discussed in the Materials and methods and Supplementary Material. Five models are considered, differing in which parameters are assumed to be the same between the two induction conditions. Parameters denoted ‘fast’ are too fast to present on the timescale of seconds. As <U+03BB>OFF-1 and <U+03BB>1-1 were found to be fast in all models, the <U+03BB>1<U+03BB>OFF-1 ratio is also shown. <U+0394>BIC values are given as the difference of the model's BIC from the BIC of the best-fitting model (the one with <U+0394>BIC = 0). Models with lower <U+0394>BIC are favoured over models with higher <U+0394>BIC.58Estimates of tCC¯ and kCC-1<U+2060>, denoted tˆCC¯ and kˆCC-1<U+2060>, were obtained from the best-fit parameters of the most parsimonious model, as given in Table 3. The standard uncertainties of the estimators tˆCC¯ and kˆCC-1<U+2060>, denoted s(tˆCC¯) and s(kˆCC-1)<U+2060>, were obtained using the Delta Method60 from the uncertainties of the model parameters.Finally, mean durations of intervals between transcription events for each media condition Iˆm<U+2060>, were estimated by fitting the model in Reaction (3) to the data from only that condition, and taking the mean of the distribution. This procedure was followed to include the censored intervals in the estimate of Iˆm to avoid underestimating the mean interval duration due to the limited observation times. The standard uncertainty s(Iˆm) was estimated using the Delta Method.602.9. Validation of the t-plot slopeWe verified the slope of the t-plot in Fig. 4 using the RT-PCR measurements from Fig. 3. These measurements are both linear with respect to Rˆm-1<U+2060>, but differ by an unknown scaling factor. We denote the estimated production rate as measured by RT-PCR in media condition m as Sˆm<U+2060>, with standard uncertainty s(Sˆm)<U+2060>. We found this scaling factor by fitting the parameter c in Iˆm=cSˆm-1 by weighted total least squares61 (WTLS), with the measurements weighted by the inverse of their uncertainty (i.e. s-2(Sˆm-1) and s-2(Iˆm)<U+2060>). This method was chosen since it accounts for the uncertainty in both of the measurements. It results in the estimate cˆ<U+2060>. The dashed line in Fig. 4 was obtained by fitting the scaled points cˆSˆm-1 against Rˆm-1 by WTLS. The uncertainty shown includes both the uncertainty in the WTLS fit of this line, as well as the uncertainty in cˆ<U+2060>.2.10. Method to infer the duration of the closed complex of a promoterThe method to infer the kinetics of transcription initiation in vivo is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, conditions are selected that differ widely in free intracellular RNAp concentrations (step A in Fig. 1). Next, an in vivo single-molecule detection technique is used to sample the time interval distribution between consecutive transcription events in individual cells in each of the conditions (step C in Fig. 1). To obtain these intervals, here we used the MS2d-GFP single RNA detection system4 (step B in Fig. 1). Then, we fit a general model of transcription initiation to the empirical data (see above), which includes both the multi-step nature of transcription initiation as well as the possibility of an intermittently inactive promoter state25 (Reactions (1) and (2)). From this fit, we obtain an estimate of the in vivo mean duration of the open complex formation by extrapolating the duration of intervals between transcription events to infinite RNAp concentrations, similar to the in vitro extrapolation presented in ref. 22 (step D in Fig. 1). The model fit will also assess the importance of an intermittent inactive promoter state and the reversibility and kinetics of the closed complex formation.

(A) First, several conditions are selected, labelled I–IV, differing in intracellular RNAp concentration, R. (B) Next, we obtain timeseries of fluorescence and phase contrast (for cell segmentation purposes) images of cells expressing MS2d-GFP and target RNA under the control of the promoter of interest in each condition, from which time intervals between individual transcription events are determined.

Changing free RNA polymerase concentrationsWe first verified that it is possible to change intracellular RNAp concentration by a wide range by changing the growth conditions of the cells.32,35,62 As such, we grew cells in four media (described in the Materials and methods), labelled 1×, 0.75×, 0.5×, and 0.25×, which solely differ in richness of two components (tryptone and yeast extract). We then measured the relative RNAp concentrations in cells grown in these four media using RT-PCR of the rpoC gene, i.e. the gene coding for the ß' subunit, which is the limiting factor in the assembly of the RNAp holoenzyme.48,57,62 Results in Fig. 2 (dark grey bars) show that, in the range tested, the RNAp concentration in the cells increases significantly with increasing media richness. Measurements of the relative intracellular RNAp concentrations (Rˆm) for cells growing in the four different media. Bars show the standard uncertainties (s(Rˆm)) of the measurements. Data is from two replicates with 3 technical replicates each (DH5a-PRO, RT-PCR, and W3110, RT-PCR), and three replicates with three technical replicates each (RL1314, RpoC::GFP). All data are presented relative to the RNAp concentration at 1×. The media used are denoted as m×, where the composition per 100 ml is: m grams of tryptone, m/2 grams of yeast extract and 1 g of NaCl (pH = 7.0).For example, 0.25× media has 0.25 g of tryptone and 0.125 g of yeast extract per 100 ml.Measurements of the relative intracellular RNAp concentrations (Rˆm) for cells growing in the four different media. Bars show the standard uncertainties (s(Rˆm)) of the measurements. Data is from two replicates with 3 technical replicates each (DH5a-PRO, RT-PCR, and W3110, RT-PCR), and three replicates with three technical replicates each (RL1314, RpoC::GFP). All data are presented relative to the RNAp concentration at 1×. The media used are denoted as m×, where the composition per 100 ml is: m grams of tryptone, m/2 grams of yeast extract and 1 g of NaCl (pH = 7.0).For example, 0.25× media has 0.25 g of tryptone and 0.125 g of yeast extract per 100 ml.To validate this result, we measured the relative RNAp concentrations by plate reader in cells expressing fluorescently tagged RpoC in the strain RL1314 (derived from W3110),33 in the same four media. In addition, we also measured the levels of the rpoC transcripts in the strain W3110 by RT-PCR in the 0.5× and 1× conditions. Results (Fig. 2) show that the relative changes in the protein and mRNA levels of rpoC match the measurements by RT-PCR of the rpoC gene in DH5a-PRO.Note that, even though the experimental procedures and strains differ, our measurements are in agreement with the relative changes in RNAp concentrations reported in ref. 32, for the difference in growth rates observed here between the 0.25× and 1× conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1), which we estimate to be ~0.48 (Materials and methods). In this regard, given that the same result applies to (at least) three different strains, we expect it to be significantly strain-independent.Finally, to verify that the relative RNAp concentrations measured in Fig. 2 are maintained under the microscope, we measured the relative RNAp concentration in the RL1314 cells expressing fluorescently tagged RpoC under the microscope between the two extreme conditions (0.25× and 1×), after 1 h in the thermal imaging chamber (Materials and methods). The relative RNAp concentration between the conditions was measured to be 0.367 ± 0.012, which is consistent with the measurements in Fig. 2. Lastly, from these images, we did not observe significant cell-to-cell variability in the RNAp concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating that the mean concentrations reported in Fig. 2 are representative of the populations.These measurements show that the relative RNAp concentration changes widely between the selected growth conditions. However, the variable affecting transcription kinetics is the relative free RNAp concentration. As such, we must verify whether the relative total RNAp concentration can be used as a proxy for the relative free RNAp concentrations. If this holds true and there are no other factors affecting the production rate of the promoter of interest in these conditions, then the RNA production rate should be hyperbolic with respect to the RNAp concentration. That is, the reciprocal of the RNA production rate from this promoter should be linear when plotted against the reciprocal of the measured relative RNAp concentrations, and one should obtain a line on a Lineweaver–Burk plot.There are several reasons why this plot may not be linear. If, for example, the ratio of free RNAp to total RNAp is not constant in this range of growth conditions, with a higher fraction of free RNAp in the poorer growth conditions due to increased ppGpp,31 then we expect a curve with positive curvature on this plot. Meanwhile, a negative curvature would be obtained if the promoter of interest could be induced by increased cAMP in the poorer growth conditions, or if the cells spent, on average, a significantly increased amount of time with multiple copies of the plasmid in the richer growth conditions, among other possibilities. In these cases, to dissect the transcription initiation kinetics of such promoters, another method of modifying the free RNAp concentration will be required.Given the above, we interpret a straight line on the Lineweaver–Burk plot as evidence that, for the conditions tested, (i) the relative free RNAp concentrations can be assessed from the total RNAp concentrations, and (ii) no factors other than the changes in the free RNAp concentration affect the target promoter.Here, we tested this by measuring the RNA production rate from Plac/ara-1 in E. coli DH5a-PRO by RT-PCR in the same four media conditions as in Fig. 2. We selected this promoter, since its dynamics has been extensively characterized2,21,29,63–67 and because it has the same logical structure as the lac promoter, with an activator and a repressor.63 The resulting Lineweaver–Burk plot is shown in Fig. 3 where a linear relationship is clearly observed between these points (black points). To determine whether the small deviations from linearity are statistically significant, we performed a likelihood ratio test between a linear fit by WTLS61 (shown as a line in Fig. 3), and fits with higher order polynomials (also by WTLS by minimizing <U+03C7>2 as in61). No test rejected the linear model (all P > 0.25). As noted earlier, this relationship is only expected to occur in a limited range of growth conditions. To illustrate this, we repeated the same measurements in 1.5× media (grey point in Fig. 3). The result shows that this hyperbolic relationship is lost in very rich media (including this point causes the likelihood ratio test to reject the linear model, P = 0.0014). We conclude that, for the growth conditions in Fig. 2, the relative free RNAp concentrations are well-approximated by the total RNAp concentrations, and there are no significant other factors affecting the initiation dynamics of Plac/ara-1.

Relative production rates were measured by RT-PCR with two biological replicates with three technical replicates each.3.2. Interval distributions between consecutive RNA productionsGiven this, it is possible to apply a standard model-fitting procedure to fully characterize the in vivo kinetics of the rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation of the Plac/ara-1 promoter from distributions of intervals between transcription events in cells with different RNA polymerase concentrations.We measured the distribution of time intervals between transcription events (hereafter referred to as ‘intervals’) for Plac/ara-1 in each cell growth condition using the MS2d-GFP single-RNA detection system,1 with a least-deviation jump-detection procedure41 (Materials and methods). This measurement results in samples from the interval distribution as well as ‘censored’ intervals, i.e. intervals for which we only observe the beginning due to cell division or the end of the time series. Both censored and uncensored intervals were accounted for in all parameter estimates to avoid biasing the estimates. For example, note that taking the mean of the uncensored intervals alone would underestimate the mean of the true interval distribution since long unobservable intervals would be absent from the estimate. Including the censored intervals balances this by considering long intervals that are at least as long as the censored interval length.25From these distributions, we estimated the true mean and the squared coefficient of variation (CV2, defined as the variance over the squared mean) of the interval distributions (Materials and methods). We chose CV2 for quantifying the noise in the interval distribution since, to a good approximation, this quantity reflects the level of noise in the protein levels regardless of the actual shape of the transcription interval distribution.68 Further, this variable equals 1 for the interval distribution of a Poisson process (i.e. an exponential distribution), regardless of the mean rate. These results, along with the amount of empirical data used, are shown in Table 1.From Table 1, the mean interval decreases significantly with increasing media richness, as expected from the increased RNAp concentrations. Meanwhile, the CV2 does not exhibit the same dependence on the media richness, and remains slightly >1 in all conditions tested.3.3. Decomposition of the in vivo kineticsFrom the data in Table 1, we next recreate the Lineweaver–Burk plot in Fig. 3 (white circles in Fig. 4), using the mean interval durations between RNA productions, as this quantity is an absolute measure of the inverse rate of RNA production (this plot is called a t-plot). t-plot for Plac/ara-1, showing the mean interval between transcription events in individual cells for each media condition (white circles), with their standard uncertainties (vertical error bars) and the standard uncertainties of the relative RNAp concentrations (horizontal error bars). Also shown is the best-fit line (solid line), as determined by the intercept and slope obtained from the best-fitting model (Table 3), with one standard uncertainty estimated by Scheffé's method69 combined with the Delta Method60 (grey area). In addition, the figure shows the data from Fig. 3 (triangles), and the best-fitting line (dashed line, see Materials and methods) with one standard uncertainty estimated by Scheffé's method69 (dotted black curves).t-plot for Plac/ara-1, showing the mean interval between transcription events in individual cells for each media condition (white circles), with their standard uncertainties (vertical error bars) and the standard uncertainties of the relative RNAp concentrations (horizontal error bars). Also shown is the best-fit line (solid line), as determined by the intercept and slope obtained from the best-fitting model (Table 3), with one standard uncertainty estimated by Scheffé's method69 combined with the Delta Method60 (grey area). In addition, the figure shows the data from Fig. 3 (triangles), and the best-fitting line (dashed line, see Materials and methods) with one standard uncertainty estimated by Scheffé's method69 (dotted black curves).Previously, using in vitro techniques, it has only been possible to extract from a t-plot the mean duration of the open complex formation (the y-intercept of the plot, here denoted tCC¯<U+2060>), because the plot is based on the steady-state assay which only measures the mean rate of abortive transcription initiations. However, the distributions of time intervals between RNA productions contain information about the stochasticity of the process (i.e. the variability between intervals). As such, it is possible to extract a more complete model of the process of transcription. Namely, aside from the open complex formation, as mentioned in Materials and methods, it is possible to extract information on the closed complex and on an intermittent state prior to the closed complex formation.In particular, we consider the detailed model of transcription initiation presented in Materials and methods (Reactions (1) and (2)), along with simplified models that can be considered if certain steps of the more detailed model do not influence the distribution of intervals. This model assumes that only one copy of the promoter is present in each cell at any given time, since in all conditions, the bacteria divided slowly, which suggests that they spent most lifetime with only one chromosome. We then consider three simplified models. First, if the time spent in the OFF state is very small, or if the system switches between OFF and ON very rapidly when compared with the forward reaction, then Reaction (2) will not affect the RNA production dynamics. A sufficient condition for both of these situations is that kON >> k1. The other two simplifications are two limits of the closed complex formation, first considered in22: (i) k-1 >> k2, i.e. it is reversible (Limiting Mechanism I), and (ii) k2 >> k-1, i.e. irreversible (Limiting Mechanism II). Limiting Mechanism I was found to be more likely in several in vitro measurements of various promoters.22,23,26While all three simplifications are consistent with a line on a t-plot, they produce significantly different distributions of intervals between RNA production events. For example, a significant ON/OFF mechanism will result in a more noisy distribution (a higher CV2).25 Similarly, Limiting Mechanism I effectively eliminates one limiting step, which also results in higher noise when compared with Limiting Mechanism II (Supplementary Fig. S2).We fit the full and simplified models of transcription initiation to the observed dynamics of Plac/ara-1 from all media conditions (Materials and methods). We used the Bayesian Information Criterion70 (BIC) to compare the fits. The BIC is a model selection criterion which balances goodness-of-fit with the number of parameters to determine which model is most likely the ‘truth’. The difference between BIC values (<U+0394>BIC) can be interpreted as evidence against the model with higher BIC, with a <U+0394>BIC > 5 being interpreted as strong evidence.58 Results are shown in Table 2. Since, for several of the models, the optimal fit was for k3-1=0<U+2060>, we also considered models that do not include another rate-limiting step after the open complex formation.From Table 2, the initiation kinetics of Plac/ara-1 is best-fit by Limiting Mechanism I (i.e. a reversible closed complex), with very high certainty (<U+0394>BIC of all other models >8). We also find evidence for a significant ON/OFF mechanism. Though the time spent in each OFF state is short (~87 s), it will turn OFF, on average, ~9.1 times before committing to transcription in the 1× case (see Supplementary Material). This results in an interval distribution which is only slightly more noisy than what would be expected if the production process were Poissonian (i.e. a CV2 of the interval distribution of 1; see the CV2 values in Table 1). Interestingly, this implies that the noise in transcription of this promoter is representative of the behaviour of the majority of promoters in E. coli.27 Finally, the steps after the commitment to transcription are fast, indicating that abortive initiation events do not play a significant role in the dynamics of RNA production by Plac/ara-1. This model is depicted graphically in Fig. 5. Best fitting model of transcription initiation (with ON/OFF mechanism and reversible close complex formation). The model parameters are specified in black and estimated durations of the transcription initiation steps for 1× LB media are shown in grey.Best fitting model of transcription initiation (with ON/OFF mechanism and reversible close complex formation). The model parameters are specified in black and estimated durations of the transcription initiation steps for 1× LB media are shown in grey.In addition, from Table 2, we find that tCC¯ is 193 ± 49 s. Meanwhile, the slope of the line on the t-plot, here denoted kCC-1<U+2060>, is 788 ± 59 R·s (R is the polymerase concentration such that R = 1 is the polymerase concentration in 1× media). The line given by these values is shown in Fig. 4 (solid line). As a side note, the uncertainties of these estimates exaggerate the uncertainty of the inference, since the estimates are highly correlated (correlation coefficient of -0.6). This correlation is responsible for the hyperbolic shape of the confidence bounds (grey region in Fig. 4).We verified the slope of the solid line in Fig. 4 using the RT-PCR measurements presented in Fig. 3, scaled to match the timescale of the intervals (Materials and methods). The resulting line is shown in Fig. 4 (dashed line), and is in good agreement with both the line given by our estimates of tCC¯ and kCC-1 (solid line), and the inferred interval means (white circles).Lastly, we note that the BIC depends on the number of samples used to calculate the likelihood. Thus, BIC values calculated assuming that each censored interval is ‘one sample’ will over-penalize models with more parameters, while removing them will under-penalize them. Both sets of <U+0394>BIC values are presented in Table 2 and, in our case, both result in the same conclusion, and thus the distinction does not affect the results for Plac/ara-1. If, for another promoter, this turns out to be the case, additional measurements will be required to distinguish between the models.Our results are in agreement with previous measurements of the kinetics of this and similar promoters. For example, a previous study reported that, under full induction in LB media (1× media here), Plac/ara-1 expresses ~4 RNA/h2 (i.e. 1 RNA every ~900 s), while we inferred the time between transcription events to be ~980 s. Using the steady-state assay, tCC¯ was measured to be ~330 s for Plac71 (with or without CRP-cAMP), while we obtained ~193 s.3.4. Determining the source of the intermittent inactive state for Plac/ara-1We identified the presence of an ON/OFF mechanism in the dynamics of Plac/ara-1. It is worth noting that this ON/OFF phenomenon differs from the one reported in refs 2 and 19 since, first, we only observe OFF periods on the order of ~87 s, while in ref. 2 the OFF periods reported for Plac/ara-1were on the order of 37 min. In addition, both here and in ref. 2, the promoter of interest is integrated in a single-copy plasmid, and thus the OFF periods cannot be explained by the buildup of positive supercoiling, since the plasmid is not topologically constrained.19 We therefore hypothesized that the OFF periods observed here more likely result from the intermittent formation of a DNA loop, due to the transient binding of LacI, which exists in high concentration in DH5a-PRO (~3,000 copies vs. ~20 in wild type63).If LacI is responsible for the ON/OFF behaviour, then reducing the concentration of IPTG should affect the ON/OFF dynamics, and not change the dynamics following the closed complex formation.29 To test this prediction, and demonstrate the utility of the model-fitting approach, besides considering the interval measurements in 1× in Table 1, we also measured the interval distribution of Plac/ara-1 using MS2d-GFP in the 1× media without induction by IPTG. From 130 cells, we extracted 57 intervals and 117 censored intervals between transcription events. From these, we inferred a mean interval of 3,374 ± 462 s, and a CV2 of 1.03. This mean is significantly greater than the mean measured in the fully induced condition (1,005 ± 112 s), consistent with the much stronger repression of the promoter by LacI in this condition.Given the wide difference in dynamics of RNA production between the induced and non-induced cases, we used the model fitting procedure to determine which steps are significantly affected by LacI. For this, we performed independent fits of a reduced model of initiation to the induced and the non-induced conditions. This model is observationally equivalent to the full model of initiation (Reactions (1) and (2)) for a single value of R, and is presented in Reaction (3). This reduced model is necessary since we do not have measurements of the uninduced case at multiple values of R with which to fit all parameters of the full model. The reduced model's parameters are denoted by <U+03BB>x, which are related to, but are not equal to the values of kx. Their relationship is presented in Supplementary Table S1. The fitting results are shown in Table 3 (labelled ‘Independent’). We also considered joint models where parameters were fixed between conditions, and used the BIC to select the most likely model.The first three models with joint parameters test for whether or not the parameters controlling the ON/OFF mechanism change with induction strength. Consistent with this hypothesis, the models with joint <U+03BB>OFF-1 are strongly rejected (<U+0394>BIC much higher than that of the Independent model). Surprisingly, the model with only joint <U+03BB>ON-1 was also rejected, implying that the mean OFF times might also vary with induction strength. Additional studies are needed to elucidate why such OFF times depend on the induction strength.Having established that <U+03BB>ON-1 and <U+03BB>OFF-1 differ between conditions, we next assessed whether only these parameters differ. For that, we fixed <U+03BB>1-1 and <U+03BB>2-1<U+2060>, and verified that this model is the most parsimonious model (<U+0394>BIC relative to the Independent model of -14.3). We conclude that only <U+03BB>ON-1 and <U+03BB>OFF-1 differ between conditions, confirming the prediction that LacI is responsible for the ON/OFF mechanism affecting the RNA production dynamics.Finally, other models were considered, e.g. the hypothesis that <U+03BB>1-1<U+2060>, <U+03BB>2-1<U+2060>, and/or <U+03BB>ON-1 do not differ between conditions. These models were also strongly rejected in favour of the parsimonious model, and are not shown for brevity.3.5. Precision of the estimatesWe define the precision of the estimates of tCC¯ and kCC-1 as the ratio between the timescale of the intervals (i.e. the mean interval in the condition with greatest R) and the standard uncertainties of tˆCC¯ and kˆCC-1<U+2060>, respectively. Specifically, the precision of tˆCC¯'s estimate is PCC¯=Iˆ1/s(tˆCC¯)<U+2060>, and the precision of kˆCC-1's estimate is PCC=Iˆ1/s(kˆCC-1)<U+2060>. Given this, here, with the volume of data in Table 1, we achieved PCC¯=20.7 and PCC = 17.0, corresponding to errors of ~5 and ~6%, respectively.In addition, we found that this precision is highly dependent on the dynamic range of RNAp concentrations. For example, for a small dynamic range of 1.5 (our measurements in Fig. 2 have a range of ~2.4), the precisions PCC¯ (in tˆCC¯<U+2060>) and PCC(in kˆCC-1<U+2060>) would have been reduced to ~11.2 and ~6.7, respectively. Losses in precision due to reduced dynamic ranges can, however, to some extent, be offset by collecting more samples for the interval distributions (see estimation of precision in Supplementary Material).4. DiscussionWe established that, in E. coli, the concentration of free RNA polymerases differs significantly within a certain range of growth conditions, and that the inverse of the target RNA production rate under the control of Plac/ara-1 varies linearly with the inverse of the free RNAp concentration (which are the conditions imposed in the in vitro measurements the open complex formation by steady state assays22,24,72). Thus, we were able to apply a standard model-fitting procedure to fully characterize the in vivo kinetics of the rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation of the Plac/ara-1 promoter from distributions of intervals between transcription events in cells with different RNA polymerase concentrations. This revealed that this promoter has two rate-limiting steps: a reversible closed complex formation and a significant open complex formation. Further, it also intermittently switches to a short-lived inactive state. Based on the inferred timescale of this inactive state, we predicted that this state is the result of the intermittent binding of the repressor LacI, which we verified by measuring the interval distribution when the promoter is not induced by IPTG. We believe that the complexity of this process is the reason why it has not been reported before. Namely, previous studies only considered either multiple rate-limiting steps,4,5,22,23,66 or an ON/OFF process,2,17,19,73,74 while this promoter exhibits both.We note that, provided that the promoter has a reversible closed complex formation, the model fitting procedure proposed here allows the duration and order of two steps following the closed complex to be obtained (specifically, the ratio between k2 and k3 can be determined from how the CV2 of the interval distribution changes with R; see Supplementary Fig. S2). Here, this additional step was not found. However, we expect that, for other promoters, or in different conditions (e.g. low temperatures72), this step may be significant. Meanwhile, if Limiting Mechanism II is found to be the best-fitting model, the order of the last two steps will remain ambiguous due to the lack of reversibility.Finally, it is worth noting that in previous works, we have not found evidence for an ON/OFF mechanism for Plac/ara-1, due to the low levels of noise detected in the time intervals between transcription events.4,21,66 This can be explained by, first, we did not consider censored intervals, which contribute significantly to the increase of the tail of the distribution of intervals.25 Second, the OFF period is quite short, and thus its detection requires a large volume of data and a sensitive inference methodology.25 Our results show that, by solving these two issues (by applying the methods in refs 41 and 25), our methodology can identify and characterize many relevant steps in transcription initiation, including those with lesser influence.In the future, it would be of interest to extend the model to consider what occurs when more than one copy of a promoter is present in the cell. We expect that variations in the promoter copy numbers would, in that case, explain some of the variance of the data, instead of this variance being solely determined by the ON/OFF mechanism and the sequential steps.We expect the methodology employed here to be applicable to promoters, native or synthetic, whose changes in the inverse of the transcription rate are linear with the inverse of the free RNAp concentrations. Also, it should be applicable to promoters evolved to interact with multiple transcription factors (TF), provided their fast binding and unbinding (compared with competing events), as they could be accounted for by tuning the rate constants of some of the reactions of the model. Further, multiple slow TFs, including activators, can be accounted for by adding appropriate TF-bound states, with differing production rates, in a similar manner to the ON/OFF model. As such, the methodology should be applicable at a genome wide scale. It should also be applicable to eukaryotes, provided suitable means to alter polymerase concentrations. Lastly, it should be useful in detecting differences in transcription initiation kinetics of a promoter subject to different intra- or extra-cellular conditions.FundingThis work was supported by the Academy of Finland (257603 to A.S.R.); Centre of International Mobility (13.1.2014/TM-14-91361/CIMO to A.S.R.); Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation (to A.H.); and the Tampere University of Technology President's Graduate Programme (to J.L.-P. and S.S.).

IntroductionThe genomes of model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice), were fully sequenced by the start of the 21st century, and databases containing chromosomal pseudo-molecules and gene annotation information have subsequently been developed and are widely used as tools and resources for plant genomics and genetics studies. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for analysing the genomes of non-model crops in which few molecular genetic studies have been performed. Genome sequences obtained by NGS can be used to construct databases that contain information of genes inferred from available information of genes in model plants. These genome databases in non-model crops will pave the way for the rapid identification of useful genes for crop breeding, which have already been identified in model plants. These databases will also facilitate the construction of fine genetic maps [based on single nucleotide polymorphism, simple sequence repeat (SSR), and NGS-based markers], and make it possible to identify agronomically important genes by map-based cloning. Thus, genome analyses in various non-model crops are underway, and the genomes of >50 non-model crops have already been sequenced (CoGepedia; https://genomevolution.org/). For example, NGS has been used to sequence the genomes of crops that produce beneficial secondary metabolites, such as flavonoid-producing Viburnum trilobum (American cranberry)1 and capsaicin-producing Capsicum annuum (hot pepper),2 and of crops that are tolerant to environmental stress, such as Setaria italica (foxtail millet)3 and Cajanus cajan (pigeonpea),4 which grow in semi-arid regions. NGS technology has opened the door to elucidating the molecular mechanisms that control agronomically important traits, and there is much interest in using this technology to analyse the genomes of non-model crops.Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench; 2n = 2x = 16) is a widely cultivated annual crop in temperate zones. This nutritionally dense non-model crop contains high levels of starch, protein, flavonoids, and dietary fibre in the grain.5 Furthermore, buckwheat flour is gluten-free and can replace wheat flour in a coeliac diet.6 Buckwheat, however, has two major defects as a crop. First, its outcrossing nature, caused by heteromorphic self-incompatibility (SI), makes it difficult to produce pure cultivars of buckwheat and to fix useful traits. Second, buckwheat grains contain allergens, which induce anaphylactic reactions in some people.7 Improving the nutritional quality of the grain and removing genes responsible for SI and allergens are important breeding objectives in buckwheat, and various genetic molecular marker systems have been developed for this purpose [e.g. amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers,8 SSR markers,9 expressed sequence tag (EST) markers,10 and array-based markers11]. However, AFLP markers have not yet been converted to single locus markers in the buckwheat genome. SSR markers have limited utility in buckwheat due to difficulty in amplifying specific loci because of the high level of genetic diversity between buckwheat cultivars, and EST marker systems do not span the entire genome. The newest genome map of buckwheat constructed using array-based markers has sufficient markers to cover the entire genome; however, it requires a specialized instrument to interpret the fluorescence signals of the arrays.11 Recently, a versatile NGS-based genotyping method with a low-cost, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) marker system was developed.12 The GBS system utilizes redundant libraries constructed with PCR fragments that have recognition sites of two kinds of restriction enzymes on both ends. The PCR fragments sequenced using NGS technology are mapped to reference sequences for genome-wide genotyping. The GBS system has been used to genotype various crop species to date.13 A draft genome of buckwheat could be used as a reference sequence for developing GBS markers to identify genes that control desirable breeding traits.Here, we used NGS-based technology to sequence the buckwheat genome, and constructed the Buckwheat Genome DataBase (BGDB; http://buckwheat.kazusa.or.jp). This database can be used for the rapid detection of homologues of genes previously identified in other plants, and we present three examples of buckwheat genes identified using this approach, i.e. genes controlling flavonoid biosynthesis and genes encoding 2S albumin-type allergens and granule-bound starch synthases (GBSSs). Furthermore, to illustrate that the draft genome can be used as a reference sequence for NGS-based genotyping, we used GBS technology to identify novel candidate genes for controlling heteromorphic SI of buckwheat.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialA single buckwheat plant with short-styled flowers, a descendant of material used in a previous study to construct a buckwheat BAC library,14 was obtained from sib-crossing (BC1F6). Nuclei were extracted from leaf tissues of the single plant as described previously.14 Subsequently DNA was extracted from the nuclei according to a previously described method.11 To construct a training set for gene prediction using Augustus 3.0.3,15 total RNA was prepared from the anthers of short-styled and long-styled plants, cv ‘KOTO’ using a previously described method.162.2. Genome sequencing of buckwheatA paired-end (PE) library with insert sizes of 180–200 bp and a mate-pair (MP) library with insert sizes of 3, 5, 10, and 20 kb were constructed from nuclear DNA according to the manufacture's protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). A PE RNA-Seq library with insert sizes of ~275 bp was also constructed. Sequencing of genomic and RNA-Seq libraries using Illumina HiSeq 2000 was respectively carried out at Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd and Beijing Genomics Institute. The PE and MP reads were subjected to quality trimming by PRINSEQ 0.20.4,17 and further to adaptor trimming by the fastx_clipper program in the FASTX-toolkit 0.0.14 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit). The quality value threshold used for quality trimming was 10 from the 3' terminal, and the adaptor sequence used was ‘AGATCGGAAGAGC’. Then, for the PE library with insert sizes of 180 bp, one base at the 3' terminal was trimmed from all reads due to low quality, and PE reads shorter than 99 bp and including undetermined nucleotides (Ns) were excluded. For the MP library with insert sizes of 3, 5, and 10 kb, reads shorter than 49 bp and including Ns were excluded, and the 50 bp from the 5' terminal were used for scaffolding. For the MP library with an insert size of 20 kb, reads shorter than 99 bp and including Ns were excluded, and the 50 bp from the 3' terminal were used for scaffolding. For the PE RNA-Seq data, reads shorter than 89 bp and including Ns were excluded. The trimmed reads were used for further analyses.2.3. Estimation of genome sizeFor genome size estimation, we used PE reads with a k-mer size of 17, as successfully used in a previous study.18 The k-mer distribution was investigated using Jellyfish 2.1.3.19 The genome size and coverage (i.e. the number of base pairs sequenced as a multiple of the number of base pairs present in the genome) were estimated using the peak at 47 on the k-mer frequency distribution curve (Supplementary Fig. S1) according to a previously described method.182.4. Assembly of the buckwheat genome sequencesThe trimmed PE reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo2 rev24020 with k-mer sizes of 61, 71, 81, and 91 nt. The option used was –RF –M 1–K [k-mer size]. After the assembly, gaps in scaffolds were closed using GapCloser 1.10 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html) (P= 31). The trimmed MP reads were used for scaffolding by SSPACE2.021 with parameters –k 5 –x 0 –g 3 –a 0.7. Sequences homologous to bacteria, fungi, and human (hg19) genome sequences, vector sequences from UniVec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/), chloroplast (accession number: NC_000932.1), and mitochondrial (accession number: NC_001284.2) genome sequences from A. thaliana, and the PhiX sequence used in Illumina sequencing by BLASTN22 searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 and length coverage of =10% were excluded as probable contamination. Finally, scaffolds longer than 300 bp were selected and designated FES_r1.0. Repetitive sequences in FES_r1.0 were detected using RepeatScout 1.0.523 and RepeatMasker 4.0.3 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) according to a previously described method.182.5. Gene prediction and annotationThe RNA-Seq reads were mapped onto the draft genome sequence (FES_r1.0) with TopHat 2.0.12.24 The bam2hints program installed in Augustus 3.0.3 was used to generate the intronhints.gff file, and Cufflinks was used to reconstruct transcripts in an exonhints.gff file. The two gff files were merged to form a HINTS file. The HINTS file was used as the buckwheat training set to predict genes for Augustus 3.0.3 (Method 1). Furthermore, genes were predicted using Augustus 3.0.2 (Method 2) and geneid 1.4.425 (Method 3) with an A. thaliana training set. Finally, the genes predicted by the three methods were merged.The merged genes were subjected to similarity searches against NCBI's NR database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) and amino acid sequences of A. thaliana from TAIR10 (https://www.arabidopsis.org) using BLASTX with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. The top hit was used to assign the product name. BLAST searches against UniProt (TrEMBL + Swiss-Prot) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-20 were also carried out. A domain search against InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) was conducted using InterProScan26 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0. Finally, genes were classified based on NCBI's euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) database27 by performing BLAST searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-4.Genes related to transposable elements were inferred based on a BLAST search against the NCBI's NR database, and conserved domains were identified based on a search against InterPro and GyDB 2.028 using hmmsearch in HMMER 3.029 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0. Transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) were predicted using tRNAscan-SE v.1.23.30 Ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) were predicted in BLASTN searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 using A. thaliana 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (accession number: X52320.1) and 18S rRNA (accession number: X16077.1) as queries.2.6. Database constructionThe draft genome sequence (FES_r1.0), predicted gene sequences, deduced amino acid sequences, annotations derived from BLAST searches against the TAIR10 and NCBI's NR databases, and domains identified in the search against InterPro were included in the BGDB. In addition, local BLAST searches and keywords searches for gene names and their annotations were also implemented in the BGDB.2.7. Genotyping-by-sequencing and detection of S-allele-specific sitesTotal DNA extracted from 18 short-styled and 18 long-styled buckwheat landraces from around the world (Supplementary Table S1) was used for GBS analysis. GBS was carried out according to Elshire et al.,12 except that EcoRI and MseI were used as restriction enzymes. Barcode adaptors are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Barcode-labeled amplicons were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 at Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. The PE reads were subjected to quality and adaptor trimming by Trimmomatic 0.3.2.31 The quality value threshold used for quality trimming was 25 with a window size of 5, and the adaptor sequences used were ‘CACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT’ and ‘ACCGCTCTTCCGATCTGTAA’. Then, PE reads longer than 39 bp were aligned to reference sequences (FES_r1.0) using BWA 0.7.9,32 and the mapping results were processed with SAMtools 0.1.18.33 To minimize mismatching bases across all the reads, local realignment procedure was carried out using RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner in GATK 3.4.34 All the sites on reference sequences that mapped with reads were extracted and combined in a variant call format file using the UnifiedGenotyper in GATK 3.4 with the option of -out_mode EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES. Sites at which >50 reads were mapped in long-styled plants but not in short-styled plants were defined as ‘non-SS’. Likewise, sites at which >50 reads were mapped in short-styled plants but not in long-styled plants were defined as ‘non-LS’. Then, the number of short-styled plants with mapped reads at each non-LS site and the number of long-styled plants with mapped reads at each non-SS site were counted. Non-LS sites shared by >10 short-styled plants were regarded as S-allele-specific sites (see Results and discussion). Then, scaffolds harbouring >39 S-allele-specific sites were regarded as S-allelic scaffolds.2.8. Phylogenetic analysesAlignments of amino acid sequences were carried out using CLUSTALW,35 and the neighbor-joining (NJ) trees36 were obtained from pairwise distances corrected by the JTT model.37 These analyses were conducted using MEGA6.383. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assembly of buckwheatThe k-mer frequency distribution curve (k-mer = 17) using PEs with 180 and 200 bp is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Based on this curve, the genome size of buckwheat was estimated to be between 1,212,021,130 and 2,424,042,260 bp using peaks at a multiplicity of 94 (coverage = 111.9) and 47 (coverage = 56.0), respectively. The genomic DNA used in this study is expected to contain heterozygous regions, due to the outcrossing nature of buckwheat; however, we used sib-mating descendant plants as material to reduce heterozygous genomic regions. The haploid genome size of 1.2 Gb calculated based on the major peak (multiplicity = 94) is almost the same as that estimated from cytometry analyses (1.34 Gb).39The numbers of raw and trimmed reads are summarized in Supplementary Table S3. The trimmed reads with k-mer sizes of 61, 71, 81, and 91 nt were assembled using SOAPdenovo2. The N50 values of the assemblies using k-mer sizes of 61, 71, 81, and 91 nt were, respectively, 1,388, 1,419, 1,350, and 770 bp. The longest scaffolds, i.e. those assembled with a k-mer size of 71, were used for further analysis. Gaps in the contigs were closed using GapCloser 1.10 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn), and mate-pair reads were used for scaffolding in SSPACE2.0. The 2,693,661 scaffolds that were shorter than 299 bp and the 1,908 scaffolds that exhibited signs of contamination (identified in a BLAST search) were excluded, and the remaining 387,594 scaffolds were designated as the draft genome sequence, FES_r1.0 (Table 1). The total length of FES_r1.0 was 1,177,687,305 bp, and the N50 length was 25,109 bp. The scaffolds were named ‘Fes_sc’ followed by a six-digit identifier and the sequence version (e.g. Fes_sc000001.1). Statistics of the draft genome sequence (FES_r1.0)Statistics of the draft genome sequence (FES_r1.0)Considering the genome size, the total length of the assembled genome sequence was close to the estimated size; therefore, the draft genome sequence (FES_r1.0) was considered as the haploid genome sequence. The draft genome sequence spanned 98.3% of the genome size estimated in the k-mer frequency distribution analysis, and 88.1% of that estimated by flow cytometry analysis.39 The high coverage rates, low N50 value (25,109 bp), and large total number of scaffolds (387,594) obtained in the present study may be due to the high proportion of heterozygous genomic regions present in the plant materials used, as indicated by the k-mer frequency distribution curve (Supplementary Fig. S1). Long-read data generated by PacBio RS was found to increase N50 and reduce the total number of scaffolds in the draft genome of Primula veris (cowslip), a heterozygous plant.40 A study of Raphanus sativus (radish)41 indicated that the lengths of scaffolds assembled based only on short-read data were drastically increased by constructing super-scaffolds with SSPACE2.0 using BAC-end sequences. We have already constructed a BAC library14 using parental plants of the material used in this study. Long reads generated by PacBio RS and BAC-end sequencing will be used to expand the scaffold length of the present draft genome of buckwheat.3.2. Gene prediction and annotationGene predictions were performed using Augustus 3.0.3 with the buckwheat training set (Method 1), Augustus 3.0.2 with the A. thaliana training set (Method 2), or geneid with the A. thaliana training set (Method 3), and the results obtained using the three methods (Methods 1–3) are summarized in Supplementary Table S4. If the genes were located at the same locus when using Methods 1–3, the longest gene was selected. After the results were integrated, the total length of the CDSs (FES_r1.0_cds) was 212,917,911 bp composed of 286,768 CDSs, and N50 was 1,101 bp. The gene name was prefixed with a six-digit identifier followed by the prediction method and scaffold number (i.e. auf: Augustus 3.0.3, buckwheat training set, Method 1; aua: Augustus 3.0.2, A. thaliana training set, Method 2; and gia, geneid 1.4.4, A. thaliana training set, Method 3), as in the following example: Fes_sc0012271.1.g000001.aua.1.Genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were inferred according to BLAST searches against the NCBI's NR database (Supplementary Table S5). The total length of known repeats was 133,362,886 bp (11.32% of FES_r1.0, i.e. 1,177,687,305 bp) and Class I long terminal repeat (LTR) elements were frequently found (8.79% of FES_r1.0). We identified unique repeats that had not previously been sequenced in this analysis, and these had a total length of 475,367,120 bp and accounted for 40.36% of FES_1.0. Genes annotated as transposons were tagged ‘TE’ in the database.Based on BLAST searches against the NR database, the genes were tagged as intrinsic (including both of a start codon and stop codon), partial (including a start codon or stop codon, or lacking both start and stop codons), pseudo (pseudogenes; including a stop codon in the coding region), and short (<49 amino acids). Based on BLAST searches against UniProt (TrEMBL + Swiss-Prot) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-20, the genes were tagged ‘f’ (hit region of =70% in query length), ‘p’ (hit region of <70% in query length), or ‘n’ (no hits against UniProt). The tags assigned to the genes are listed in Supplementary Table S6; 35,816 predicted genes tagged as full length or partial were annotated by BLAST searches against NR and/or UniProt. The predicted genes were classified based on NCBI's KOG database for F. esculentum, Beta vulgaris (which is classified in the same order, Caryophyllales, as F. esculentum), and A. thaliana (the most advanced model plant). KOGs for the predicted genes in the three species were assigned to the 25 functional categories, which were classified into four large groups (Groups 1–4; Supplementary Table S7), and the percentage of KOGs in each category was calculated for each plant species. Figure 1 shows the percentage of KOGs in Groups 1–3. Note that the number of KOGs assigned to the functional categories of N (cell motility) in Group 2 was <10 for all three species and was excluded in Fig. 1. The distribution of KOGs in each large group was similar among these species. For instance, KOGs from all three species were enriched in categories K, O, and G, and were poor in categories B, W, and H. In addition to the protein-coding genes, we identified 1,374 genes for tRNAs in total, and the numbers of genes for each tRNA are summarized in Supplementary Table S8. Assignment of proteins to KOG functional categories in the three plant species. Genes from F. esculentum (red), B. vulgaris (blue), and A. thaliana (green) were classified based on NCBI's KOG database by performing BLAST searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-4. KOGs were classified into functional categories. The percentage of KOGs in each functional category is plotted, and percentages are arranged in ascending order within each group.

Note that KOGs in Groups 1–3 are shown, and that fewer than 10 KOGs were assigned to category N (cell motility) in the three species and were excluded.Assignment of proteins to KOG functional categories in the three plant species.

Note that KOGs in Groups 1–3 are shown, and that fewer than 10 KOGs were assigned to category N (cell motility) in the three species and were excluded.Consequently, we were able to identify >35,000 annotated genes including genes for tRNA. Many of them were classified into similar functional categories as in the other two plant species. The BGDB constructed in this study on the basis of FES_r1.0 is expected to serve as a useful tool for identifying genes to develop buckwheat cultivars with improved agronomic properties. The BGDB is available from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (http://buckwheat.kazusa.or.jp). To demonstrate the utility of this database, we then conducted four test analyses focusing on agronomically important genes.Buckwheat contains several kinds of flavonoids, such as flavonols, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins. The flavonol rutin is present at high levels in buckwheat seeds42 and seems to be beneficial for human health. Several genes encoding enzymes related to flavonoid biosynthesis in buckwheat have been reported43,44 and are presumed to be regulated by transcription factors (TFs), such as MYB, bHLH, and WD40, as in other plant species.45–48 However, little is known about such TFs in buckwheat. The R2R3-MYB TFs are thought to play central roles in plant-specific processes, based on their specific gene expression patterns.49–51 To provide an overview of genes that regulate plant-specific processes, including flavonoid synthesis in buckwheat, we searched for candidate genes encoding R2R3-MYB TFs using the BGDB.By conducting a keyword search using the term ‘MYB’, we identified 274 genes predicted to encode MYB TFs. From these, we excluded partial sequences, pseudogenes, and genes that did not contain fully conserved R2R3 regions. The remaining 71 putative R2R3-MYB TFs obtained from the database are listed in Supplementary Table S9. Phylogenetic analyses based on the R2R3 domain often reveals functionally characterized groups that are present in a wide range of plant species.52,53 In the present study, six putative R2R3-MYBs were assigned within known functional groups consisting of representatives from other plant species (Supplementary Fig. S2). Though functional analyses would need to be conducted to determine the role of each gene, this finding shows that R2R3-MYB genes, which likely have different roles, can successfully be obtained from the BGDB.To initiate the transcription of genes encoding enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, a TF such as MYB or the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex must bind to TF binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoter region of each gene. Mutation of TFBSs alters the expression of genes.54,55 Therefore, MYB TFs as well as the TFBSs of target genes can be manipulated to improve flavonoid production. To identify promoter sequences in a non-model plant species, genome walking, which is time-consuming and expensive, would usually be performed. In this study, we tried to identify the promoter sequences of genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and estimated the TFBSs using PLACE (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/). cDNA sequences of nine genes in the pathway have been already registered in GenBank. For three of these genes (chalcone isomerase, CHI; flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, F3'H; anthocyanidin synthase, ANS), we successfully determined the 1,000–2,000 bp upstream region after a BLASTN search against the BGDB. DNA motifs relating to the MYB or MBW complex predicted by PLACE analysis are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. These results can be confirmed by molecular techniques such as gel-shift assays, as reported for other plant species (e.g. apple,56 persimmon,53 and soybean57). The BGDB is thus a powerful tool for isolating promoter sequences and accelerating molecular-based analyses of TFs. In this study, however, we could not identify sufficiently long promoter regions (over 1,000 bp) for the remaining six genes, mainly because of gaps between contigs. Gap closing using long reads generated by a PacBio sequencer will greatly improve the ability to search for the promoter regions of target genes.Buckwheat seeds contain allergens. For instance, Fag e 2 (16 kDa protein) is a pepsin-resistant 2S albumin that causes an immediate allergic reaction.58 Although Fag e 2 cDNA has been sequenced,58 no further genomic information is available. Efforts to develop hypoallergenic buckwheat and establish inspection techniques to minimize allergen contamination in food products require detailed genomic information of Fag e 2.A BLAST search of Fag e 2 (accession number: DQ304682) among the predicted proteins in the BGDB yielded one identical gene (Fes_sc0000087.1.g000014.aua.1) and four homologues (Fes_sc0000087.1.g000011.aua.1, Fes_sc0000087.1.g000013.aua.1, Fes_sc0000087.1.g000028.aua.1, and Fes_sc0007211.1.g000003.aua.1) (Table 2). The results of a BLAST search against the NCBI's NR database indicated high similarities of four homologues with previously reported allergens of buckwheat. As shown in Fig. 2, the predicted amino acid sequences of Fes_sc0000087.1.g000011.aua.1 and Fes_sc0000087.1.g000028.aua.1 showed high levels of similarity (97 and 98%, respectively) with the buckwheat 8 kDa allergen, which is a member of the 2S-albumin multi-gene family.59 In contrast, the predicted proteins of Fes_sc0007211.1.g000003.aua.1 and Fes_sc0000087.1.g000013.aua.1 did not have high levels of amino acid sequence similarity (43 and 79%, respectively) with known buckwheat allergens. Fes_sc0007211.1.g000003.aua.1 had a 55-amino acid deletion at the N terminal and lacked four of eight characteristic Cys residues present in Fag e 2 and 2S albumin family.60 Thus, the gene product is not likely to be allergenic. On the other hand, Fes_sc0000087.1.g000013.aua.1, which shows similarity with Fag e 2, might be a novel allergen, because its predicted protein retained the eight characteristic Cys residues. Further immunoblotting analysis will clarify whether or not the protein encoded by Fes_sc0000087.1.g000013.aua.1 is allergenic. It is notable that four genes that retain conserved Cys residues are estimated to be located within a genomic region of 108 kb on single scaffold (Fes_sc0000087.1). Particularly, the Fag e 2 gene (Fes_sc0000087.1.g000014.aua.1), and the Fes_sc0000087.1.g000011.aua.1 and Fes_sc0000087.1.g000013.aua.1 homologues, which have similarities with buckwheat allergens, are located within a 17 kb region of the scaffold. Therefore, this region would be a prime candidate for silencing in studies aimed at producing hypoallergenic buckwheat.

Starch contains two types of glucose polymer, i.e. amylopectin and amylose.61 Amylopectin is the major component of starch (60–90%),62 whereas the amylose content varies among plant species.63 Since the amylose content affects the properties of starch, modulating the amylose content has been an important breeding objective in crops.64 GBSS catalyses amylose synthesis.65 Thus, we searched for genes encoding starch synthases (SSs) from the BGDB, and aimed to identify GBSS genes using phylogenetic approaches.To identify buckwheat GBSS genes, we conducted a keyword search using ‘starch synthase’ and obtained 42 hits. We then filtered these hits using modified five conserved sequence motifs proposed by Cao et al.66 [i.e. P(2)K(1)GGL(1)D(4)L, VS(5)E, G(2)NG(7)P(2)D, R(3)QKG, D(5)S(2)EPC(1)L(1)Q(5)YG(8)GGL (numbers in parentheses represent numbers of amino acids)]. Of the eight resulting sequences, one was excluded, as it was annotated as a pseudogene. The seven remaining sequences were each derived from a different scaffold.To assign these seven putative SSs of buckwheat to previously proposed phylogenetic groups,67 we performed NJ analysis using the deduced amino acid sequences of SSs from various plant species. A keyword search using ‘starch synthase’ was also conducted in Phytozome 10.3 (http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/) analysing 36 angiosperm species (Supplementary Table S10). Of the 27,852 sequences identified, 238 sequences remained after the same filtering procedure as mentioned earlier and were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Two GBSS sequences of Fagopyrum species, one from F. esculentum deposited at the EMBL/GENBANK/DDBJ (accession number: HW041459) and the other from F. tataricum (AHA36967.1),68 were also included in the analyses. A NJ-tree based on the alignment was suggested to contain the following five known phylogenetic groups: SSI, SSII, SSIII, SSIV, and GBSS (Supplementary Fig. S4). The SS sequences obtained from the BGDB belonged to four of the five classes. This suggests that the BGDB can be used to identify agronomically important genes. However, the previously deposited GBSS (HW041459) sequence is not identical to any of the seven sequences identified in the BGDB, and a BLASTN search using the coding region of HW041459 as a query detected only partially identical sequences over 360-bp and three scaffolds (Fes_sc0195744.1, Fes_sc0059460.1, and Fes_sc0005470.1). This is a shortcoming of the short scaffold size of the assemblies in the BGDB.The GBSS clade contained four phylogenetically distinguishable sequences in total: HW041459 and three from BGDB. To clarify the detailed phylogenetic relationship among these four GBSS genes, we performed NJ analysis based on 71 aligned amino acid sequences of GBSS including those from Physicomitrella patens as outgroup (Fig. 3). The copy number of GBSS genes varies in plants; two diverged groups exist in the rosids69 and several copies of GBSS in buckwheat seem to also have diverged, at least in two lineages. In the cladogram, a GBSS sequence, Fes sc0004292.1.g000004, clustered with a GBSS sequence from F. tataricum, which belongs to the same genus. GBSS of F. tataricum was confirmed to be expressed in the endosperm,68 thus Fes sc0004292.1.g000004 is likely to be expressed in the endosperm too. If more than one GBSS is active within endosperms, the amylose content of buckwheat flour can be controlled by altering their copy number. In hexaploid wheat, Yamamori and Quynh70 evaluated the dosage effects of three GBSS genes. Loss of function of these genes is expected to differentiate the starch properties of the grain; moreover, distinct proportions of amylose might be produced according to copy number of active GBSS genes. Studies are underway to examine the expression of the three buckwheat GBSS genes identified here, and also the previously identified one (HW041459).

Buckwheat is a heteromorphic self-incompatible crop with dimorphic flowers (i.e. short-styled and long-styled flowers). Short-styled flowers have short styles and long stamens, whereas long-styled flowers have long styles and short stamens. The SI response is expressed between plants bearing the same flower morph, but not between plants bearing different flower morphs. Flower morph and SI response are determined by a diallelic system at the SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY supergene complex locus (S locus); S/s heterozygotes and s/s recessive homozygotes bear short-styled and long-styled flowers, respectively.71,72 Recently, S-LOCUS EARLY FLOWERING 3 (S-ELF3), which controls the short-styled phenotype of buckwheat, was isolated.16 Furthermore, it was suggested that recombination is strongly suppressed around S-ELF3.16 Based on these findings, we predicted that S-allelic scaffolds exist in which heteromorphic SI-related genes other than S-ELF 3 are located. Thus, we tried to detect S-allelic scaffolds in the draft genome and to identify novel candidate genes involved in the SI response in these.To obtain S-allele-linked scaffolds from the draft genome, we used GBS reads obtained from each of 18 short-styled and 18 long-styled landraces of buckwheat originating from various countries (Supplementary Table S1). Briefly, GBS reads from 36 plants were mapped to scaffolds of >1,000 bp, and we subsequently extracted the non-LS sites (i.e. sites not present in all the long-styled plants) in which no reads from all of the 18 long-styled plants were mapped. The number of mapped reads for each plant ranged from 1,620,260 to 2,821,338 (Supplementary Table S11). The number of mapped reads per long-styled plant was not significantly different from that per short-styled plant (P-value is 0.536, t-test). We determined how many short-styled plants share each non-LS site, and the number ranged from 1 to 18 (Fig. 4). As a control, non-SS sites (i.e. sites not present in short-styled plants) were also counted as above, and the number of long-styled plants sharing non-SS sites ranged from 1 to 10 (Fig. 4). The number of non-LS sites and non-SS sites identified in GBS reads. Sites at which >50 reads were mapped in long-styled plants but not in short-styled plants were defined as ‘non-SS’. Sites at which >50 reads were mapped in short-styled plants but not in long-styled plants were defined as ‘non-LS’. The number of non-LS (blue bar) and non-SS sites (red bar) was plotted against the number of short-styled plants sharing the non-LS sites and of long-styled plants sharing the non-SS sites, respectively.The number of non-LS sites and non-SS sites identified in GBS reads. Sites at which >50 reads were mapped in long-styled plants but not in short-styled plants were defined as ‘non-SS’. Sites at which >50 reads were mapped in short-styled plants but not in long-styled plants were defined as ‘non-LS’. The number of non-LS (blue bar) and non-SS sites (red bar) was plotted against the number of short-styled plants sharing the non-LS sites and of long-styled plants sharing the non-SS sites, respectively.As shown in Fig. 4, a striking U-shaped distribution was obtained when the number of non-LS sites was plotted against the number of short-styled plants sharing the non-LS sites. In contrast, non-SS sites shared by >10 long-styled plants were not detected at all. Considering that there was no significant difference in the number of mapped reads obtained from short-styled and long-styled plants, we regarded the non-LS sites shared by >10 short-styled plants as ‘S-allele-specific sites’. In total, 88,031 of the S-allele-specific sites were detected and found to be located on the S-allelic region, consisting of 332 of scaffolds encompassing 5,393,196 bp (Supplementary Table S12). Of the 332 scaffolds, Fes_sc0003500.1 and Fes_sc0015090.1 harbour S-ELF3 and SSG2, respectively. Since we previously established that S-ELF3 and SSG2 existed only in the genomes of short-styled plants,16 this result shows the effectiveness of our procedure in discovering the S-allelic region in the buckwheat genome. However, it should be noted that we used only one restriction enzyme combination (EcoRI and MseI) to obtain the GBS reads; we did not detect S-allelic scaffolds harbouring no recognition sites for these enzymes. Thus, the total length of the S-allelic region in the buckwheat genome obtained in the present study might be an underestimation.In the S-allelic region, repeat sequences were abundant; the ratio of repeat length to the total length of the S-region was 71.43%, which is 1.4-times higher than that of the ratio of repeat length to the total scaffold length (51.69%, Supplementary Table S5). Gypsy elements were particularly abundant in the S-region; the Gypsy elements accounted for 12.15% of the S-region, which is 1.9 times higher than that of the repeat length in the total scaffold length (6.41%, Supplementary Table S5). Excluding TEs, only 32 predicted genes were successfully annotated by our database analyses in the 332 scaffolds (Supplementary Tables S12 and S13). Among the 32 predicted genes, two were candidates for heteromorphic SI related genes; Fes_sc0024869.1.g000002 and Fes_sc0006594.1.g000005 were predicted to encode proteins with similarity to a RING/U-box superfamily protein and an exoribonuclease 4, respectively. The RING/U-box protein is an E3 type ubiquitin ligase that functions in the 26S proteasome.73 It has been suggested that degradation of cytotoxic S-RNases by the 26S proteasome in pollen tubes occurs during compatible pollination in a self-incompatible species, Petunia inflata.74 Ongoing studies currently evaluating the expression pattern of these two genes and the effect of mutations in these two genes will clarify their roles in heteromorphic SI of buckwheat.4. Conclusion and future perspectiveThe genome size of buckwheat is relatively large (~1.2 Gb), and some genomic regions are expected to be in the heterozygous state due to its outcrossing nature. These factors would reduce the lengths of our scaffolds in the buckwheat draft genome, which was assembled using only Illumina short reads. Though the draft genome was trancated and divided into a large number of scaffolds (387,594 scaffolds), we have successfully identified genes that control agronomically important traits using gene predictions and subsequent annotations in the BGDB. Furthermore, we also identified novel candidate genes involved in heteromorphic SI of buckwheat using the draft genome as a reference sequence for GBS mapping. Even if the scaffolds in a draft genome are truncated, they can nonetheless be used for database construction and as a reference sequence for NGS-based genetic markers. We are now preparing induced mutant pools of buckwheat using heavy-ion beams and chemicals such as ethyl methanesulfonate. Using NGS-based multi-dimensional screening,75 mutants of the genes identified in this study will be rapidly identified from the pool and will be used to develop superior varieties of buckwheat.5.

IntroductionPlants have evolved a huge-array of transcription factors (TFs) to modulate transcription of genes in response to the environmental signals. Plants have >6% of genes encoding for TFs.1WRKY genes comprise one such TF family that has mainly expanded and diversified in higher plants. WRKY TFs are characterized by a highly conserved WRKY domain (WD) of ~60 amino acids that preferably bind to W-box besides other DNA motifs.2 The WRKY TFs derived their name from the heptad motif sequence ‘WRKYGQK’ of WRKY DNA-binding domain. WRKY proteins are broadly divided into three groups based on the number of WDs and the type of zinc-finger motif. The group-I has two WDs with C2H2-type zinc-finger motif, group-II has one WD with C2H2-type zinc-finger motif, and group-III has one WD with C2HC-type zinc-finger motif.3 After the identification of the first WRKY gene from sweet potato4 and recognition of WRKY family in Arabidopsis,3WRKY genes have been identified from most of the genome or transcriptome sequenced plants. Earlier, WRKY genes were considered exclusive to higher plants, nevertheless sequencing have showed their presence in many lower plants and non-plant organisms.5The main role of WRKY TFs has been deciphered with regard to biotic stress associated processes.6 However, they are also recognized as important components of abiotic stress signalling. The WRKY proteins play a role in the antagonistic interaction of SA- and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated signalling7 and convergence of JA and auxin signalling.8 They are also the major targets of various perturbation-activated MAPK cascades.9 Nevertheless, individual studies have shown their involvement in various stages of plant development. The AtWRKY23 gene assists in auxin distribution during root development by controlling flavonol biosynthesis,10OsWRKY11 controls flowering time and plant height,11 and some WRKY genes are involved in secondary metabolism.12 WRKY proteins play some interesting roles also; AtWRKY40 is recruited on the host plant transformed Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA for Ipt gene expression13 and AtWRKY6 restricts arsenate uptake and transposon activation.14 However, WRKY proteins function in partnership with various protein families for fine-tuned roles.9,15Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the second largest cultivated legume crop. Debilitating fungal diseases Ascochyta blight and Fusarium wilt along with the chewing insect Helicoverpa armigera are major concerns for chickpea production.16 The WRKY TF genes, being important regulators in biotic and abiotic stress, could be utilized to improve chickpea and related legumes as reported for soybean WRKYs.17 The crop legume chickpea is closely related to model legume barrel medic (Medicagotruncatula). Moreover, the availability of mutants in M. truncatula and Lotus japonicus will colossally help in functional characterization of genes. We report the identification and comparative analysis of 78 WRKYs from C. arietinum and 98 from M. truncatula. Some novel WRKY genes have been identified from legumes. Here we demonstrate phylogeny, expression, and localization study data of one such unique chimeric protein CaWRKY16. Comparative analysis of a selected region from the galegoid clade and millettioid clade legumes showed that two unique WRKY genes evolved locally due to two independent events. In addition, we have generated expression profiles of group-III WRKY genes in response to hormone treatments and Ascochyta rabiei infection. The tissue-specific expression profile of these genes is also reported. Further, we characterized a salicylic acid (SA)- and A. rabiei-induced WRKY gene with regard to W-box-binding activity, subcellular localization, transcription modulation potential, and overexpression in tobacco plants. Therefore, this study will form the basis of functional characterization of legume WRKYs and will be a foundation study for developing stress-tolerant legume crops.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of WRKY genes from C. arietinum and M. truncatulaA preliminary search for the chickpea WRKY proteins was performed on the annotated proteins of two different chickpea varieties (BioProject PRJNA175619 for ‘CDC Frontier’ and PRJNA78951 for ‘ICC4958’) available at NCBI.18,19 The C. arietinum, M. truncatula (Mt4.0v1), and A. thaliana WRKY proteins were further used as query in tblastn to find WD-encoding regions from the genome and transcriptome of ‘CDC Frontier’ and ‘ICC4958’ varieties. We also searched the predicted WRKY genes on other sources like chickpea transcriptome database (CTDB) (http://www.nipgr.res.in/ctdb.html) and http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/itak/index.cgi. Manual corrections with regard to open-reading frame (ORF) were also performed on the annotated WRKY genes of chickpea. The M. truncatula-annotated proteins were derived from http://jcvi.org/medicago/. The proteins that were not annotated as WRKY proteins in Mt4.0v1, despite the presence of WD, were manually checked and re-annotated as WRKY genes.2.2. Exon–intron structure and phylogenetic analysisThe exon–intron organization of WRKY genes was manually checked and the ‘GT’ splice donor and ‘AG’ acceptor sites were verified. The exon–intron structure was generated using online tool Gene Structure Display Server (GSDS 2.0; http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn). The largest transcript isoform of ‘CDC Frontier’ variety WRKYs was used for exon–intron display. The multiple sequence alignment of C. arietinum and M. truncatula WRKY proteins was executed using PROMALS3D (http://prodata.swmed.edu/promals3d/promals3d.php) and MUSCLE. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by maximum-likelihood method in MEGA 6.06. The branch confidence values were obtained by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations. The multiple sequence alignment for WDs of C. arietinum and A. thaliana proteins was generated using MUSCLE in MEGA 6.06.2.3. Domain and motif identificationThe SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) and Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/search) were used to predict and verify the functional domains. MEME (Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation) program 4.11.1 available at http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme was used to predict the potential motifs in WRKY proteins. The transmembrane (TM) helices were predicted by the use of TMHMM Server v.2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/).2.4. Plant materials and treatmentsTo grow C. arietinum variety ‘Pusa 362’ plants, four seeds were sown in each plastic pot filled with sterile agropet and vermiculite mix. They were maintained in greenhouse at 22 ± 2°C and 3-week-old healthy plants of similar phenotypes were used for spray inoculation of freshly collected A. rabiei spores, 5 mM SA, 100 µM JA, and 100 µM abscisic acid (ABA) to the individual experimental plants. The control plants were sprayed either with water or water–ethanol mix. After regular time-intervals the aerial tissue was harvested randomly. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in -80°C for long-term storage.2.5. RACE (random amplification of cDNA ends)The cDNA end sequences of selected CaWRKY genes were determined by 5'- and 3'-RACE using the SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) as per the instruction manual. The gene-specific primers used for amplification are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.6. RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysisTotal RNA was extracted from the frozen chickpea tissue using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). This RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by oligo(dT) priming of ~2 µg RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). The PCR was set in a 96 well-plate using the SYBR® Green qPCR Master Mixes (Agilent). The gene-specific primers used for RT–PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR was carried out on Applied Biosystems® Real-Time PCR systems using following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, and annealing and extension at 58–61°C for 30 s. The relative expression values were calculated using ß-tubulin as an internal standard.2.7. Yeast one-hybrid analysisThe full-length ORF of CaWRKY50 was cloned in pGBKT7 vector along with three C-terminal deletion constructs and one N-terminal deletion construct. The transactivation assay was performed using yeast strain AH109 (Clontech). The ß-galactosidase assay was performed as per the instructions of yeast protocol manual (Clontech). Yeast one-hybrid was performed for W-box-binding assay. The ORF of CaWRKY50 was cloned in pGADT7 vector and W-boxes were cloned in pHis2.1 using Pchn5F1/Pchn5R1 and mPchn5F1/mPchn5R1 oligonucleotide pairs. The W-box binding was checked by comparing the growth of respective clones co-transformed yeast strain Y187 cells on SD/-Leu/-Trp and SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/+20 mM 3-AT.2.8. Overexpression of CaWRKY50 in tobaccoThe CaWRKY50 was cloned under CaMV35S promoter by replacing the uidA gene of pBI121. The obtained clone was mobilized into A. tumefaciens LBA4404. The axenically grown Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi plant leaves were used for transformation. The oligonucleotide pairs of CaM35SeqF/WRKYRTR, NPTIIF/NPTIIR and WRKYRTF/pBI121R2 were used to confirm transgenic tobacco plants and expression of CaWRKY50 in tobacco.2.9. Measurement of total chlorophyll contentThe tobacco leaf senescence was assessed by measuring the total chlorophyll content of PCR confirmed transgenic 19-week-old plants along with the wild-type plants of same age. The two leaves from each plant's lowest stem axis whirl were used. They were weighed and crushed in liquid nitrogen. The chlorophyll extraction was performed using 80% acetone. The total chlorophyll amount was calculated as described by Poora.202.10. DNA methylation analysisTotal genomic DNA was extracted from aerial tissues of chickpea variety Pusa 362 using DNeasy® Plant mini kit (Qiagen). One microgram of this genomic DNA was treated with bisulfite using EpiTect® Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) along with an equal amount of a PCR amplified fragment as control to check the conversion efficiency. The primers, used for CaWRKY16 amplification using the bisulfite-treated DNA as template, are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were cloned in pJET1.2 vector and sequenced. At least 10 clones, for each position of CaWRKY16's selected genomic region, were sequenced, and data were analysed online by Kismeth software (http://katahdin.mssm.edu/kismeth/revpage.pl).3. Results3.1. Identification of C. arietinum and M. truncatula WD-encoding genesA simple search of proteins annotated as ‘WRKY TF’ in the C. arietinum cv. ‘CDC frontier’ protein sequences revealed 81 genes. Two of these genes were partial and four were non-WRKY genes. We further explored both Desi and Kabuli chickpea sequenced genomes to mine the WRKY genes. The presence of a WD was taken as criteria to call a gene as C. arietinum WRKY (CaWRKY). The recently released ‘ICC 4958’ CDS v2.0 was also used to check WRKY genes.21 However, of the 103 CDS annotated as WRKY, only 68 CDS had WD. It resulted in identification of 82 consensus regions among the two C. arietinum varieties. These 82 genomic regions were further checked for the expression by analysing the CTDB database (http://www.nipgr.res.in/ctdb.html), the 454 cDNA reads derived from A. rabiei inoculated aerial chickpea tissue (Kumar et al., unpublished) and chickpea RNA-seq data from NCBI. After manual inspection, four entries were removed from 82 consensus regions. Thus, in chickpea genome, 78 genes were identified to be encoding for full-length WD. The coordinates and orientations of CaWRKY genes on ‘CDC Frontier’ chromosome assembly were obtained. The CaWRKY genes were assigned numbers from CaWRKY1-70 as per their order and position on the chromosomes from top to bottom (Supplementary Fig. S1). The unplaced eight genes were named from CaWRKY71 to CaWRKY78 as per the order of scaffold contig identifiers. We checked 10 genes for full-length by RACE and 20 genes were checked for ORF amplification with 100% success rate. Further insilico analysis of CaWRKYs was performed only for ‘CDC frontier’ WRKY genes.The closest legume to C. arietinum among the sequenced genomes is M. truncatula. Since the limited study of M. truncatulaWRKY (MtWRKY) genes,22 many new genes have been annotated in Mt4.0. Hence, we decided to compare CaWRKY genes with that of M. truncatula. The M. truncatula (Mt4.0) has 111 predicted genes of WRKY gene family. Comparison with CaWRKYs revealed that few MtWRKY genes need re-annotation. The Medtr2g075680 annotated as cysteine-tRNA ligase has WD and thus included as MtWRKY gene while Medtr3g085710, Medtr6g013150, Medtr7g022360, and Medtr7g028350 are not WRKYs. Many other genes lack full-length WD while for Medtr1g077760, Medtr5g018380, and Medtr7g105000 the exon–intron junctions were corrected to get full WDs. The adjacent gene model pairs of Medtr7g104980 and Medtr7g105000 was collapsed into a single gene Medtr7g105000 with a proper WD. Thus, the MtWRKY genes encoding for WD got reduced to 98.3.2. Phylogenetic comparison of WRKY proteinsThe division of WRKY proteins into three groups was earlier proposed and it was based on phylogeny and WD structure.3,23 A robust phylogeny requires a good sequence alignment. The diversity outside the WD is more prevalent; therefore, the PROMALS3D was used to align the full-length WRKY proteins. It resulted in better alignment outside the WD and reduced dependency on manual adjustments. Among the identified WRKYs of C. arietinum and M. truncatula, four proteins have chimeric sequences (CaWRKY16, CaWRKY17, Medtr5g073620, and Medtr5g074200). Therefore, only the WD sequences of these four proteins were considered for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree clearly divided WRKY proteins into three groups: I, II, and III (Fig. 1). This phylogeny clearly showed evolutionary history of WRKY genes and re-confirmed a recent report on the evolution of WRKY genes in flowering plants.5 The group-II was complex and large; hence, it was further sub-divided into group-IIa to -IIe as done with Arabidopsis WRKYs. The group-IIc was very close to group-I while others were clearly separate (Fig. 1). This division was also supported by the number of WDs and the type of zinc-finger motif in WDs. Thus, in chickpea, group-I, -IIa, -IIb, -IIc, -IId, -IIe, and -III have 13, 5, 11, 16, 6, 12, and 11 members while barrel medic have 16, 5, 11, 18, 7, 16, and 18 members, respectively. Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of C. arietinum and M. truncatula WRKY proteins. CaWRKYs are highlighted with a filled circle against their names. The alignment was performed on PROMALS3D server, and phylogeny was constructed using MEGA6.06. Bootstrap values were derived from 1000 iterations and bootstrap values >30 are represented. The group names are indicated against deep branches.

Bootstrap values were derived from 1000 iterations and bootstrap values >30 are represented. The group names are indicated against deep branches. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Along with clear division of most WRKY proteins, few exceptions were also present. The CaWRKY17, Medtr4g021780, Medtr5g018380, and Medtr5g074200 proteins belong to group-II based on WD structure, but these proteins clustered along with the group-III members in both neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood methods. Another exception was CaWRKY12 with two unusual WDs, but it clubbed with group-III in phylogeny. Similar observation was for CaWRKY33, CaWRKY73, Medtr1g077780, Medtr1g078260, Medtr6g086555, and Medtr7g062220 encoded proteins. These proteins were unfit for group-I as they lack two WDs (Fig. 1; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These genes thus must have evolved from group-I in these legumes. The apparent expansion of MtWRKY genes when compared with CaWRKY mainly happened in group-IIe and -III. In other groups, minor differences have appeared.3.3. WRKY gene structure and physical distribution on chromosomesThe apparent comparison of chickpea and Medicago WRKY orthologues position on the chromosomes was in agreement with the broader comparison of these two genomes.18 All assembled chickpea chromosomes except Ca08 contain WRKYs (Supplementary Fig. S1). The lack of CaWRKY on Ca08 may be attributed to partial assembly of it in ‘CDC Frontier’ when compared with Mt06. In chickpea and barrel medic, orientation of genes on chromosomes is relatively same in both directions. In chickpea, 34 CaWRKYs are in the top-to-bottom direction among the 70 genes placed on seven chromosomes. The most conserved group-I occupies four chromosomes of M. truncatula, i.e. Mt03, Mt04, Mt05, and Mt07, and group-I CaWRKYs also occupies the corresponding chromosomes of chickpea (Supplementary Fig. S1). The expansion of MtWRKY genes by tandem and segmental duplications with respect to chickpea can also be clearly visualized. We considered tandem-duplicated pairs only when genes within 200 kb genomic region belong to the same group. Chickpea CaWRKYs had four such pairs (CaWRKY14-15, CaWRKY37-38, CaWRKY47-48, and CaWRKY52-53) while M. truncatula had 11 such pairs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The tandem-duplicated in barrel medic are Medtr2g075610 to Medtr2g075750 while segmental duplications are in Mt02 and Mt08 chromosomes. Thus, it explains the presence of more WRKY members in M. truncatula. In these two legumes, we established orthology for 70 pairs of genes based on homology and syntenic region around them.The exon–intron structure of a gene family can provide additional evidences to support the phylogeny. All the WRKYs of these two legumes had intron(s) except CaWRKY17, CaWRKY49, and Medtr5g074200. The CaWRKY49 looks partial when compared with its closest CaWRKY78. The number of introns varies in WRKYs of these two legumes from one to seven. However, few genes like Medtr2g105060, Medtr8g098945, CaWRKY5, CaWRKY51, and CaWRKY61 have absence of intron in their WD. A preliminary look at the genomic structure of barrel medic and chickpea WRKYs showed high conservation at C-terminal, a region that encodes for WD (Fig. 2). The increase in size of WRKY genes has taken place towards the N-terminal of WD-encoding regions. The intron phase was two for the entire group-I C-terminal WD introns. The intron phase was also two for group-IIc, -IId, -IIe, and -III WD introns while it was zero for group-IIa and -IIb WD introns. The intron phases were same in almost all the related introns within a WRKY group (Fig. 2). The position of intron in the WD among a group is also conserved. The ‘PR’ type intron was present in group-I C-terminal WDs and group-IIc, -IId, -IIe, and -III while the WD of group-IIa and -IIb had ‘VQR’ type intron.

Characteristics of WD and motifsIn a WD-specific phylogeny, group-I WDs separated and the remaining WDs clubbed together as per their respective group (Supplementary Fig. S2). We compared the conservation of WD in each WRKY group and found some group-specific sequence variants in both legumes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Many variants of ‘WRKYGQK’ signature-sequence were present in the WRKYs of both legumes (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The SMART and pfam servers revealed the presence of four domains outside the WDs. In group-IId WRKYs, a plant zinc-cluster domain (PF10533) was present before the WDs. A coiled-coil region was also predicted at the N-terminal end of CaWRKY62, CaWRKY64, CaWRKY65, and their MtWRKY orthologues. In CaWRKY16 and Medtr5g073620, a TM, an Exo70, and a WD were predicted while a TM along with a WD was present in CaWRKY17 and Medtr5g074200. A partial DUF3664 (pfam12406) was identified between SP cluster and N-terminal WD of CaWRKY22, and a partial merozoite surface domain (pfam07133) was present in CaWRKY56 at N-terminal. The motifs were also inspected in WRKYs by MEME tool and are represented as motifs of C. arietinum (MotifCa) and motifs of M. truncatula (MotifMt) followed by motif number. In chickpea, out of the 12 motifs identified, 4 (MotifCa1, 2, 3, and 5) were within the WD (conserved DNA-binding structure of ~60 amino acids) (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interesting among chickpea motifs were MotifCa8 and MotifCa9. The MotifCa8 has leucine at regular intervals and may act like a leucine zipper, probably responsible for dimerization. It was present in 15 CaWRKYs belonging to group-IIa, group-IIb (except CaWRKY56 and CaWRKY70), and a group-III member, CaWRKY16. The motif corresponding to MotifCa8 in barrel medic was MotifMt8 (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). The MotifCa9 and MotifMt10, present in group-I members only, were similar to the SP-cluster and D domain.9 In chickpea, MotifCa6 and MotifCa7 were present downstream to WD and were alanine-rich. Also interesting was MotifCa11 with consensus sequence of PTxTLD[LF]T after the WD of group-IIb proteins. In M. truncatula, out of the 12 motifs identified 5 (MotifMt1–5) were within WDs (Supplementary Fig. S5). The remaining motifs were of unknown nature and in future after functional characterization may be associated with specific roles.3.5. CaWRKY16 and CaWRKY17 are unique genesAmong functionally characterized WRKY genes, AtWRKY52 (RRS1/SLH1) and AtWRKY16 (RRS1B) have unique genomic arrangement.24 Some unique Golgi apparatus localized WRKY and Exo70J proteins have been reported from legumes.25 The Golgi-targeting of these proteins is by the virtue of an N-terminal TM domain. The chickpea orthologue of GmWRP1 (Glyma14g199800) is CaWRKY17 (LOC101503578). Residing in the nearby genomic region of chickpea is another unique gene CaWRKY16 (LOC101500706) that encodes for a protein with N-terminal TM domain along with a group-III WD (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2). The WD of CaWRKY16 is flanked by partial Exo70 domains and has an N-terminal TM domain just like GmWRP1 and CaWRKY17 (Supplementary Fig. S6). The orthologues of CaWRKY16 are present in M. truncatula (Medtr5g073620), L. japonicus (Lj2g3v2314850.1), and Pisum sativum (PsCam035857_1_AA).26 However, CaWRKY16-like gene is absent in transcriptome/genome of millettioid clade legumes soybean and common bean. We were unable to amplify the annotated ORFs of CaWRKY16a and CaWRKY16b in our experiments, although in RNA-seq data the expression is known (Fig. 3A). Thus, we decided to perform 3' RACE of CaWRKY16 using forward primers from the annotated first and second exons. Results indicated that CaWRKY16 has got an alternative polyadenylation after the predicted third exon. However, transcript isoform that we amplified was different from CaWRKY16c and therefore we named it CaWRKY16d (Fig. 3A). The shorter isoform CaWRKY16d encodes for a protein with an N-terminal TM domain followed by a partial Exo70 and a C-terminal WD. The C-terminal EYFP-decorated CaWRKY16d protein showed punctate localization in onion cells (Fig. 3B). This could be possibly the Golgi apparatus, as TM domain at N-terminal is responsible for the similar localization of GmWRP125 and TM domain in these proteins is highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, our study demonstrates the presence of a unique WRKY gene in galegoid clade legumes. CaWRKY16 gene structure, transcribed mRNA isoforms, and subcellular localization.

Expression profile of group-III CaWRKYs in A. rabiei stress and hormone signallingGroup-III WRKY members are interesting for the aspects that they have a completely different WD zinc-finger, enormously expanded in rice and unique genes CaWRKY16 and AtWRKY52 belongs to this group. Chickpea has 11 members in this group (Fig. 1). To gain preliminary insight into the function of these chickpea WRKY genes, we investigated their transcript level using real-time PCR during the activation of stress signalling by SA, JA, and ABA treatments and A. rabiei spore inoculation (Fig. 4). Broadly they showed induction in SA and A. rabiei spore treatments. The steady high state in SA was maintained by CaWRKY16, CaWRKY46, and CaWRKY67. After 0.5 h of SA treatments, CaWRKY46 and CaWRKY50 achieved highest level. A set of group-III genes, i.e. CaWRKY14, CaWRKY45, and CaWRKY76, responded to ABA treatment also but late when compared with SA. CaWRKY45 and CaWRKY76 that responded to ABA at 24 h were the genes whose expression level steadily went down after initial induction during SA. In ABA treatment, CaWRKY14 responded very early and at higher levels. This gene along with CaWRKY76 was biphasic in ABA treatment. No significant induction was seen in the JA treatment while CaWRKY50, CaWRKY67, and CaWRKY69 got slightly down-regulated with respect to the control. This trend is consistent with the findings that in A. thaliana SA and JA signalling works antagonistically over many genes. In chickpea, infected with A. rabiei spores, the genes responded at different time intervals. High levels of transcript were maintained by CaWRKY14 and CaWRY67 at all time points with respect to control while CaWRKY45 and CaWRKY69 were biphasic. High level of initial induction (6 h after A. rabiei spore spray) of WRKYs must be due to non-specific fungal elicitors or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are released during spore germination and development. Expression profiles of C. arietinum group-III WRKY genes under hormone treatments and A. rabiei infection. Relative transcript expression values when compared with the controls were determined by qRT–PCR. The mean expression values of three biological with three technical replicates were used for representation with Mev 4.9. The expression scale is same for ABA, JA, and SA whereas for A. rabiei infection it is different.

Expression pattern of group-III CaWRKYs in different tissuesThe expression analysis of genes can apparently give preliminary idea about their functions. We analysed the transcript level expression of group-III CaWRKY genes under normal growth conditions in six different vegetative and reproductive tissues (root, stem, leaves, flowers, seed and pod cover) by real-time PCR (Fig. 5). The expression of group-III genes was observed in all developmental stages of plants grown under normal conditions. However, the pod cover was found to accumulate least concentration and thus was treated as control for relative expression. Interestingly, there was a high expression level for 10 genes in seed tissue, although differences in expression level existed within them. After the seed tissue, the expression level in leaves was high for the same 10 genes. Five genes (CaWRKY10, CaWRKY14, CaWRKY24, CaWRKY45, and CaWRKY67) showed preferential expression in two tissues (seed and leaf). The level of expression for CaWRKY76 was high in leaves when compared with other tissues. The genes CaWRKY15, CaWRKY16, and CaWRKY50 were expressed ubiquitously in all tissues. In root tissue, CaWRKY10, CaWRKY46, and CaWRKY50 showed considerable expression, albeit lesser than leaf or seed tissues. Among the WRKYs expressed in leaves, the expression of CaWRKY24 and CaWRKY46 was exceptionally high. Therefore, expression level quantified here suggests that some members of group-III must have tissue-specific roles. Expression analysis of group-III WRKY genes in different tissues of C. arietinum. The samples of chickpea were collected from 4-week-old plants for the root, stem, and leaf tissues. Bloomed flowers were sampled at reproductive stage while pod cover and seeds were collected at the same time points. The mRNA level expression was analysed by qRT–PCR using chickpea ß-tubulin gene as internal control. The relative mRNA level was calculated with respect to the pod cover. The results presented here were obtained from three biological replicates with three technical replicates each. The error bars represent ±SD of means.Expression analysis of group-III WRKY genes in different tissues of C. arietinum.

CaWRKY50 is a W-box-binding transcriptional activatorMany group-III CaWRKYs were induced at transcript level during the hormone and A. rabiei treatments, and CaWRKY50 was one of them. It was originally isolated as partial EST in suppression subtractive hybridization library screening of A. rabiei-induced chickpea genes.27 The full-length cDNA sequence was identified through RACE and submitted as the first full-length WRKY of chickpea (NCBI accession: EU049488). Thus, we further focused on characterization of SA and A. rabiei-induced CaWRKY50. The WRKY protein, being a transcription regulator, needs to localize to plant nucleus and bind regulatory elements of target genes. The CaWRKY50-EYFP fusion protein localizes in nucleus of onion cells (Fig. 6A). To further investigate whether CaWRKY50 has capability to localize to the eukaryotic nucleus by itself, we used a yeast nuclear import assay.28 In yeast strain L40, a fusion protein of mutated bacterial LexA (mLexA) TF and CaWRKY50 localizes into yeast nucleus and activates the reporter gene LacZ (Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus, these two results suggest that CaWRKY50 can enter eukaryotic nucleus and resides in plant cell nucleus. CaWRKY50 subcellular localization in plant cell and yeast one-hybrid assays.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Sequences outside WD(s) vary among members of WRKY group thus providing functional diversity and unique characters. We used yeast one-hybrid system to check the transcription activation and W-box-binding activity of CaWRKY50. The Gal4BD-CaWRKY50 fusion protein can activate LacZ reporter in the yeast cells. The ß-gal activity comparison among the yeast cells transformed with various C-terminal truncations of CaWRKY50 showed that the transcription activation activity mainly resides in 40 amino acids of C-terminal end. However, it was interesting to note that a single N-terminal deletion results in more ß-gal activity than the full-length CaWRKY50 for unknown reasons (Fig. 6B). To check whether CaWRKY50 can bind to W-box in yeast, we cloned a fragment of a chitinase promoter having two W-boxes, along with mutated W-boxes as negative control (Fig. 6C). The promoter region of CaWRKY50 was also used as a separate clone in this experiment. The growth of yeast on auxotrophic selection (SD/-Leu/-Trp/+20 mM 3-AT) clearly showed that CaWRKY50 binds to W-box in a sequence-specific manner and its own promoter (Fig. 6D). Thus, from these experiments we inferred that CaWRKY50 is a plant nuclear localized transcriptional activator and it can bind to W-box.3.9. Overexpression of CaWRKY50 gene in tobaccoTransformation of some legume species for functional genomics is a challenging task. Therefore, to investigate the role of CaWRKY50 in plant growth and development, we decided to transform it in tobacco. However, during transformation process, the number of shoots regenerated from calli was very less using CaWRKY50 overexpression construct compared with vector control (pBI121). Shoot regeneration in CaWRKY50 construct became comparable to vector control after increased supplementation of cytokinin in media. It suggests that ectopic overexpression of CaWRKY50 in tobacco plant interferes with hormone signalling.Most of the PCR-positive CaWRKY50 transgenic tobacco plants showed phenotypic differences when compared with the vector control plants, during hardening and seed setting under greenhouse conditions. The tobacco plants overexpressing CaWRKY50 were dwarf with chlorotic lesions on leaves and matured early, i.e. early flowering (Fig. 7A). The extent of these phenotypes correlated with the expression level of CaWRKY50 transcript, i.e. more in overexpression lines B2 and B3 (Supplementary Fig. S8A). The appearance of similar phenotypes in early generations of AtWRKY53 overexpressing Arabidopsis plants that disappeared in subsequent generations has been described in earlier report.29 Such lesions on plant leaves are often associated with oxidative stress. Thus, the leaves of tobacco (T0 transgenic) lines with chlorotic lesions were analysed for the presence of H2O2. The 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine staining clearly showed H2O2 accumulation in chlorotic areas of high CaWRKY50 expressing B3 and Y1 lines when compared with the low CaWRKY50 expressing P1 line, vector control (BV), and wild-type leaves (Supplementary Fig. S8B). For subsequent analysis, five transgenic lines B2, B3, P1, and Y1 with varying level of CaWRKY50 transcripts along with BV line were selected. However, in the subsequent generations (T1 and T2), dwarfism and chlorotic lesions gradually disappeared (Supplementary Fig. S9) despite the expression of CaWRKY50 but the early flowering and senescence phenotypes were regularly observed. We utilized the T2 transgenic plants to check the developmental effects of CaWRKY50 ectopic expression in tobacco. We observed that flower buds in B2, B3, and Y1 transgenic lines (T2 generation) appeared 21 ± 5 days prior to BV line and wild type. However, in the P1 line, flower buds appeared 10 ± 3 days prior to BV line and wild-type plants. We measured early senescence phenotype on leaves of T2 transgenic plants by estimating total chlorophyll content from the lower stem axis leaves of tobacco as previously reported in Arabidopsis.29 The early senescence phenotype showed a positive correlation with the expression of CaWRKY50 in tobacco. The lower leaves of CaWRKY50 overexpressing B2, B3, and Y1 line tobacco plant had 2.5–3 times less chlorophyll when compared with the wild-type and vector control plants of the same age (Fig. 7B). Thus, our results clearly demonstrated that CaWRKY50 overexpression in tobacco results in early senescence and early maturation (appearance of flower buds). This corroborates the studies on its Arabidopsis orthologue AtWRKY53, a master regulator of age-induced leaf senescence. Overexpression of CaWRKY50 in tobacco leads to early flowering and senescence.

WRKY genes in C. arietinum and M. truncatulaIdentification and functional characterization of WRKY genes in plants gained pace with the advent of next-generation sequencing technology. We identified 78 and 98 WRKYs in C. arietinum and M. truncatula, respectively. Number of WRKY genes is more in chickpea when compared with L. japonica (61) while they are very less with regard to palaeopolyploid soybean (182). However, M. truncatula has evolved more WRKYs than C. arietinum mainly by tandem duplication in contrast to soybean where the expansion was due to segmental duplication.30 Number of WRKYs in chickpea is close to that of A. thaliana (72). Some novel WRKY genes in both legumes were difficult to be grouped, with confidence, in three known WRKY groups and thus remained unclassified (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). An identified feature of WDs is the divergence from conserved sequence ‘WRKYGQK’. But, these differences in the heptad sequence became relevant after reports that an amino acid in WD heptad sequence is acetylated by bacterial effector for virulence.31 We identified many variants of this WD conserved motif in chickpea and barrel medic (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The importance of these variants is also highlighted by the facts that NtWRKY12 having a divergent heptad ‘WRKYGKK’ binds to a different motif (TTTTCCAC)32 and variants of soybean GmWRKY6 and GmWRKY21 do not bind normally.17 Tools are now available to decipher the DNA motifs occupied by these variants with reduced cost of ChiP-Seq. Therefore, future studies may find new motifs to which these proteins bind. In general, the conserved group-I N-terminal WD has zinc-finger consensus of Cx4Cx22HxH, but in CaWRKY41, it is Cx4Cx23HxH due to a triplet repeat-induced change. Thus, CaWRKY41's N-terminal WD may also bind to DNA. It is expected that the local interaction with pathogens and environment may have influenced expression, sequence divergence, and co-evolving interacting partners. Thus, functional studies will be of worth use in these evolved WRKY genes.4.2. WRKY genes and retrotransposon elementsTransposons are known to modulate arrangement of genes in genomes, and sometimes species-specific amplification of transposons gives unique features to particular species. While analysing orthologues of CaWRKYs in M. truncatula, we also matched the surrounding genomic regions of up to three genes to analyse the synteny around WRKY genes between these two legumes. We were surprised to find transposon remnants, tandem duplication events, and GDSL-motif encoding genes wherever synteny breaks. The remnants of transposons were found around the 31 CaWRKY genes mostly belonging to group-II and -III. Thus, evolution of WRKY and their surrounding regions is influenced by transposons.Based on our comparative analysis, we speculated that evolution of CaWRKY16-like genes was by the action of transposons. Presence of transposon can alter the expression level of nearby genes and can modulate transcript isoforms, if present in introns. Such cases exist for wheat,33A. thaliana RPP7 gene,34 and oil palm.35 The CaWRKY16 has three predicted transcript isoforms and we cloned the fourth CaWRKY16d isoform (Fig. 3A). The CaWRKY16c and CaWRKY16d isoforms are the products of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation possibly due to the presence of an inactive Ty1-copia retrotransposon sequences. Sequence with homology to UBN2 superfamily protein is present ~100 bp downstream to CaWRKY16d transcript cleavage site. The presence of transposon sequences can modulate the methylation status of genomic DNA, may add new cis-elements to be recognized by cleavage factors, and can influence nucleosome positioning. All these changes can contribute to alternative cleavage and polyadenylation.36 We analysed DNA methylation status of ~1.6 kb region around the CaWRKY16c and CaWRKY16d isoforms cleavage and polyadenylation region. The common exonic region of CaWRKY16c and CaWRKY16d isoforms has higher percentage of GC content, but it showed only ~50% methylation of all three types (Supplementary Fig. S10). The region downstream to the cleavage site has more fraction of methylated DNA although percentage GC is less. Thus, there is differential methylation at DNA sequences of exons, introns, and region after cleavage site, which also harbour transposon sequences (Supplementary Fig. S10).4.3. Group-III WRKY gene expressionThe WRKY genes are mainly characterized with respect to plant stresses. In accordance with this, the transcript level of many WRKY genes gets modulated during stresses.6 We checked barrel medic's group-III WRKYs expression in online available data.37 However, probe set IDs of nine WRKY members were not found including a set of five genes (Medtr2g075610–Medtr2g075750) that show signatures of tandem duplication within a genomic region of ~50 kb. More data are available from the experiments related to root symbiosis, an area highly explored in this model legume. In barrel medic, Medtr7g073380's expression was high in most of the tissues and Medtr3g093830 maintained higher levels in leaf and root. Interesting was the higher expression of Medtr8g005750 in root hairs in response to nod factors and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 while Medtr3g093830 also responded to these signals. Only Medtr5g073620 and Medtr7g117200 were induced 3 weeks after mycorrhizal treatment while remaining six genes got down-regulated. The down-regulation of these genes could be related to the suppression of defence responses. Such type of down-regulation is seen during symbiosis and establishment of biotrophic lifestyle on host plants by pathogens. An Exo70I protein has recently been shown to be required for development of a sub-domain of the periarbuscular membrane during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.38 Hence, the analysis of Medtr5g073620 (encoding for a novel Exo70) mutants could reveal its novel function during symbiosis. Six genes except Medtr5g073620 and Medtr8g005750 responded to salt stress. Analysis of group-III WRKY genes in A. thaliana has earlier revealed that their expression is independent of phylogeny. In chickpea and barrel medic also, this seems to be true as group-III orthologues express differently. The CaWRKY14-15 tandem-duplicated genes responded to A. rabiei and SA treatments but at different level. In a set of duplicated WRKY gene, Medtr7g073430 probably evolved its role during nodulation as it gets expressed higher during nodulation. Analysis of 1.5 kb promoter region's cis-acting elements in chickpea and barrel medic failed to reveal reasons for the tissue-related expression. However, the genes of chickpea responding to SA and A. rabiei were having at least four W-boxes and two TGA TF-binding sites similar to the barrel medic four elicitor responsive genes (Medtr3g090860, Medtr3g093830, Medtr7g117200, and Medtr8g099350). A resemblance was found in chickpea and barrel medic with respect to expression of WRKYs upon JA treatment. They were either down-regulated or did not respond significantly to JA treatment. This could be due to the TGA factors that regulate antagonistic nature of SA and JA signalling through NPR1.39 The early response of some WRKY genes upon A. rabiei spore inoculation is most likely due to the PAMP-activated signalling. The WRKY genes are in fact part of PAMP-activated signalling by being the downstream targets of MAPKs.9 A systemic analysis of the promoter will reveal the regulatory aspect of group-III WRKY genes during stress signalling or may help in identification of some novel elicitor responsive elements.4.4. CaWRKY16 gene evolved in galegoid cladeUnique proteins with a Golgi-targeting TM domain were reported recently from soybean.25 The other domains in these soybean proteins with Golgi-targeting TM domain are Exo70 (in seven GmExo70Js) and WRKY (in GmWRP1). We have reported here another unique gene CaWRKY16 that is located in same genomic region that havens legume-specific TM domain-encoding genes and chickpea orthologue of GmWRP1 i.e. CaWRKY17 (Fig. 8). Presence of two unique WRKY genes with different WDs within ~127 kb genomic region of chickpea Ca02 suggests towards their independent origin. CaWRKY17 gene evolved in a progenitor of legumes prior to the diversification of millettioid and galegoid clade legumes as its orthologues are present in both clade members (Fig. 8) and also in Arachis duranensis (http://peanutbase.org). Based on the fact that CaWRKY16-like gene is absent in soybean and common bean transcriptome/genomic sequences while it is present in four analysed galegoid legumes, we propose that CaWRKY16-like genes must have evolved in galegoids after separation of these legumes from millettioid legumes. Annotated genes of Phaseolus vulgaris (Ch08), Glycine max (Ch02 and Ch14), M. truncatula (Ch05), and C. arietinum (Ch02) are represented as arrow or triangle. Base pair coordinates of the genomic regions on assembled chromosomes are indicated in parenthesis to the left of each genomic segment. Orthologue genes at ends of genomic segment are connected by dotted lines. Genes marked with asterisk have stop codons in C. arietinum.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Annotated genes of Phaseolus vulgaris (Ch08), Glycine max (Ch02 and Ch14), M. truncatula (Ch05), and C. arietinum (Ch02) are represented as arrow or triangle.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We have discussed here the localized evolution of CaWRKY16 and CaWRKY17-like genes in a specific genomic region of legumes. The unique WRKY gene evolution hypothesis presented here is backed by comparing phylogenies of WDs (Supplementary Fig. S2) and Exo70 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S11). We also compared genomic region among barrel medic, chickpea, common bean, and soybean to support our hypothesis on CaWRKY16 evolution. An apparent look at these genomic regions shows that this region in barrel medic region is highly dynamic with many events of tandem duplication and presence of NCR-peptide encoding genes (Fig. 8). Phylogeny revealed that WD of CaWRKY16 is close to CaWRKY14's WD while WD of CaWRKY17 is close to the N-terminal WD of CaWRKY18 (Supplementary Fig. S2). As these four genes are placed in a nearby genomic region, CaWRKY16 and CaWRKY17-like genes must have evolved by the local events in this variable region of legumes. CaWRKY17 possibly evolved from a TM domain-encoding gene that gained WD by partial duplication of CaWRKY18 N-terminal WD or by an event of unequal crossing-over between them. Such events of unequal crossing-over within the tandem-duplicated genes can generate new genes.40 The evolution of CaWRKY16 seems to be complex and possibly involves the action of transposing elements as two large introns in CaWRKY16 showed homology with inactive copia-type retrotransposons. The association of WRKY genes with transposons is already known in regard to zinc-finger motifs of WD.41 The introns of CaWRKY16-orthologue from L. japonicus are small, which suggest a possible transposon excision event in Lj2g3v2314850.1. Thus, the two WD-encoding exons may have appeared between an Exo70J gene by the action of transposons, which carried WD exons along with them. Later, these transposons got inactivated in chickpea while in barrel medic and L. japonicus they got excised. Soybean Exo70J gene (LOC100816208) is closest to CaWRKY16 (Supplementary Fig. S11) and it must be a progenitor of CaWRKY16-like gene of the galegoid clade legumes.4.5. Molecular functions of CaWRKY16Our expression analysis suggested that CaWRKY16 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all chickpea tissues, and it responds to SA and A. rabiei (Figs 4 and 5). Thus, it should have a role in SA-induced plant responses against pathogens. The possible molecular role of these unique multi-domain proteins can be understood from their motifs and domains. A TM domain of CaWRKY16 may localize it to Golgi apparatus while group-III WDs are known for DNA binding. The Exo70 domains of both CaWRKY16 and CaWRKY17 are close to well-characterized AtExo70B members. In Arabidopsis, Exo70B subclade genes AtExo70B1 and AtExo70B2 control the immune signalling against bacterial, oomycetes, and fungal pathogens.42,43 Recent reports also indicate towards the importance of Exocyst and its component Exo70 in plant–pathogen interaction. The OsExo70F members interact with AVR-Pii to regulate plant immunity44 and Phytophthora infestans effector AVR1 interacts with exocyst component Sec5 to manipulate plant immunity.45 The TIR-NBS2 or associated molecules monitor the integrity of AtExo70B1, making it an important component of plant defense43 and AtExo70B1 also interacts with RIN4.46 A model in which unique chimeric genes function as decoy or help in pathogen effector recognition has emerged in cases like rice Pikp-1 interacts with AVR-PikD and two linked pairs with atypical WRKY genes AtWRKY16 and AtWRKY52 recognize effector activity.24,31,47 Thus, being so close to Exo70B group CaWRKY16 in association with CaWRKY17 may behave as decoy to detect pathogen effectors. The regulation of plant genes by CaWRKY16 is another aspect but for that it needs to move from Golgi apparatus to nucleus after specific signal perception. The group-III member CaWRKY16 despite its ‘WKKYGKK’ variant WD may bind to regulatory regions of target genes.4.6. CaWRKY50 is a functional orthologue of AtWRKY53In Arabidopsis, group-III WRKY genes are involved in plant senescence and defence. Among them, role of AtWRKY30, -53, -54, and -70 is documented for plant senescence. AtWRKY53 is a positive regulator whereas AtWRKY54 and AtWRKY70 are the negative regulators of plant senescence. Our overexpression analysis in tobacco also demonstrates that CaWRKY50 can induce plant senescence making it a functional orthologue of AtWRKY53 from chickpea (Fig. 7). This functional closeness is also supported by phylogeny. Both AtWRKY53 and CaWRKY50 are induced by SA and pathogens, and they also act as transcriptional activators in yeast. Another gene AtWRKY4148 is also close to CaWRKY50 and it plays role in PAMP-induced signalling. However, AtWRKY41 responds at a lower level to SA signalling compared with AtWRKY53.49 To confirm whether AtWRKY53 and CaWRKY50 are similar at molecular level, CaWRKY50's interaction was checked with a CaMEKK as in Arabidopsis AtMEKK1 physically associates with AtWRKY53.50 However, in yeast two-hybrid analysis chickpea CaMEKK (LOC101498916), closest to AtMEKK1, failed to interact with CaWRKY50 and CaWRKY73 (Supplementary Fig. S12). This could be attributed to the divergence of MEKKs outside kinase domain or variation in Arabidopsis and chickpea WRKYs or evolution of a unique case in Arabidopsis. Thus, sequence comparison and CaWRKY50 overexpression in tobacco leading to early senescence and flowering showed that CaWRKY50 is a functional orthologue of AtWRKY53 despite differences at molecular level.Taken together, our research has helped in the identification of WRKY genes in agriculturally important legumes and seems to be the first report on a comparative account of WRKY genes from two legumes. Functional characterization of legume WRKY genes will also hasten in model plants L. japonicus and M. truncatula, where transposon mutant lines are available for many genes. Identification of legume-specific WRKY genes will also help promoting the research to identify and functionally characterize chimeric WRKY genes that have independently evolved in other plant systems. The CaWRKY group-III genes expression study presented here will serve as reference in the expression of WRKY genes. Our study also demonstrates that despite sequence divergence in WRKY genes many functional similarities do exist. We will also further focus our study to elucidate role of CaWRKY16 and CaWRKY50 in plant–pathogen interaction using model legumes.FundingThis work was funded by Department of Biotechnology, Government of India through research grant for the Challenge Program on Chickpea Functional Genomics project (Sanction No. BT/AGR/CG-Phase II/01/2014) and core grant from National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, India.

PTEMD and the genome-wide polymorphic TEs in M. oryzae and maize are publically available at http://www.kanglab.cn/blast/PTEMD_V1.02.htm.1. IntroductionTransposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences capable of moving in genomes. On the basis of their transposition mechanism, TEs can be divided into two major classes: RNA-based retrotransposons (Class I) and DNA transposons (Class II). Since the discovery of TEs >50 years ago, TEs have been regarded as genetic parasites.1–3 Recent studies have, however, indicated that TEs and their movements affect genome size, genome stability, gene function, gene evolution, and epigenetic regulation.4–8 Also, TEs are important factor for genome size variation in plants.9 In grasses, the diploid genome sizes vary ~30-fold, and most of the variation is due to the amplification of LTR retrotransposons in the intergenic regions of genomes.10 It has become increasingly clear that TEs might be a major genomic source of genetic diversity that enables host genomes to respond to environmental changes.11Despite the presence of thousands or millions of TEs in a genome, most of them are silenced or are no longer mobile. In other words, few of them are still actively transposing that create TE polymorphism in closely related individuals in a species. Nevertheless, it is the polymorphic or active TEs that play the most important role in inserting polymorphism and allelic diversity, which are essential for population dynamics.Given the importance of polymorphic TEs, however, to the best of our knowledge, no program has been designed for de novo scanning polymorphic TEs in a genome-wide fashion. So far, programs such as RepeatMasker,12 RECON,13 Repeatscout,14 and Piler15 have been used to identify repeat sequences (including TEs). RepeatMasker, which detects repeat sequences by using both genome sequences and repeat sequence libraries,12 has been used in many genome projects.16–20 Piler is a signature-based repeat searching tool, the program searches a query sequence for particular structures or motifs that are characteristic of a known repeat sequence.15 An important limitation of RepeatMasker and Piler is that they rely on the structure and characteristics of known elements and therefore cannot detect novel elements. In contrast, Repeatscout14 uses k-mer and spaced seed approaches21 that can identify repeat families de novo based on genome sequences without the use of repeat libraries. In addition to identifying repeat sequences, some programs, like TEMP,22 RelocaTE,23 and T-lex,24 can detect TE insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) based on high-throughput pair-end short reads or next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads from a single sample or multiple samples from individuals of a population. However, all of the above-mentioned tools do not identify TEs de novo. Therefore, there is a need to develop a program for de novo identification of polymorphic TEs genome-widely.In this study, we developed a novel method named polymorphic TEs and their movement detection (PTEMD) that identifies polymorphic TEs de novo and uncovers genome-wide TIPs using reference genome and high-throughput short reads. Our method relies on reads situated at ‘breakpoints’, i.e. reads that span inserted TEs and their flanking sequences. The new method was written in a Linux-based program. Using the PTEMD program with representative fungal and plant genomes, we have detected multiple polymorphic TE families and TIPs.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequence dataThe Magnaporthe oryzae reference genome sequence (version 8) was downloaded from the Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org). To test the PTEMD program, we re-sequenced the genomes of M. oryzae strains HM-1 and HM-2, which were isolated from rice lesions by the single-spore method (data available from the PTEMD program homepage http://www.kanglab.cn/blast/PTEMD_V1.02.htm). The strains were cultured on oatmeal medium, and the hyphae were collected. DNA was extracted from hyphae using the CTAB method,25 and the purified DNA was used for constructing Illumina sequencing libraries with about 500-bp insert size. The libraries were sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform to generate 101-bp pair-ends reads with about ×50 coverage of the M. oryzae genome. The re-sequence data sets of M. oryzae generations 0, 10, and 20 were downloaded from a M. oryzae re-sequencing project (GenBank accession number: one isolate of generation 0: SRX220856; three isolates of generation 10: SRX220857, SRX220858, and SRX220859; three isolates of generation 20: SRX220860, SRX220861, and SRX220862). The maize B73 reference genome sequence was downloaded from the Plant Genome Database (http://www.plantgdb.org/). Mo17 re-sequencing data set was downloaded from GenBank SRA data sets (GenBank accession number SRX245309).2.2. Comparison of PTEMD with different programsPTEMD-A focus is to identify polymorphic TEs genome-wide, and it is the first program that focuses on de novo identifying polymorphic TEs. The programs RepeatMasker,12 Repeatscout,14 Piler,15 and RECON13 were compared with PTEMD-A for de novo scanning of repeat sequences in M. oryzae genome. The library used in this study is the Repbase library (version 19.06; http://www.girinst.org/repbase/). The programs used in this study are RepeatMasker (version 4.05; http://www.repeatmasker.org), Repeatscout version 1.0.514, Piler (http://drive5.com/piler), and RECON version 1.08 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RECON-1.08.tar.gz). The default or general parameters were used for the programs.PTEMD-B focuses on identifying the TIPs, and its performance was compared with the well designed and widely used TIP scanning programs, such as RelocaTE version 1.05,23 T-lex (version 2),24 and TEMP (version 1.01).222.3. PCR validation of TIPsIn order to validate the predicted TIPs, 30 positions in HM-1 and 30 in HM-2 were randomly selected from the PTEMD-detected MoTE-1 insertion regions. We designed 60 specific primer pairs for the 60 selected insertion regions. PCR (Tm: 55°C, 36 cycles) was carried out to determine the TE polymorphisms between reference genome and HM-1/2. When reference genome is subjected to PCR, all of the primer pairs amplify 100- to 300-bp products. The products were resolved on 1% agarose gel through electrophoresis to distinguish the size difference due to TE insertion between HM-1/2 and the reference genome.2.4. Runtime and memory requirement of PTEMDThe present version of PTEMD was programmed in Perl and was tested in a Linux system. We tested PTEMD using a small genome (M. oryzae), and a large and repeat-rich genome (maize; Zea mays L.). In the M. oryzae genome, the 40-Mb genome sequence and 2-Gb clean bases of high-throughput reads data (×50 coverage of the genome) were used; ~1.5 h of CPU time was needed for detecting all of the polymorphic TE families, and 10 min of CPU time was needed for de novo detection of the new insertion sites for a single 2-kb TE sequence. When the maize genome B73 was tested (genome size ˜ 2.1 Gb), 70-Gb clean bases high-throughput reads data (accession number: SRX245309, about ×35 coverage of the genome) were used, ~23 h of CPU time was needed for detecting all of the polymorphic TE families.3. Results3.1. PTEMD detection of polymorphic TEs and TIPsActive TEs or recently active TEs often create insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in the population. PTEMD utilizes this feature to collect TEs or other movable sequences that are involved in the formation of polymorphisms. PTEMD consists of PTEMD-A (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and PTEMD-B (Supplementary Fig. S1B) pipelines. The objective of PTEMD-A is to identify the polymorphic TE families. First, high-throughput short reads will be mapped to the reference genome (Fig. 1A, left and middle part, partially assembled genomes are also been supported). For a certain locus, if there is a TE insertion in the reference genome but absent from the genome under re-sequencing, a ‘gap’ will form where reads are mapped to the flanking sequences but not the sequence in between (detail parameters refer to Pindel program).26 Those sequences in the gap represent putative mobile unit and will be retrieved from the reference genome, thereafter, PTEMD uses a pair-wise sequences alignment strategy to construct a distance matrix (Fig. 1A, right part) for all retrieved sequences. We used a time-saving method in this pair-wise sequence-alignment step. Only sequences of similar size were used for the pair-wise alignment (not exceeding 10% length), and the sequence identity was recorded as a vector in each distance-matrix calculating cycle. The sequences with low sequence identity (<75%) were not used for the alignment in the next step of the traversal cycle. This reduced the running time by 53–73% (Supplementary Fig. S2A–C) in the tested data sets. Since intact polymorphic transposons are usually highly similar, only those sequences which have at least three homologous sequences sharing =97% identity over 95% length will be retained and classified into different TE families, using this criterion, our result showed that only a small part of PTEMD-detected sequence families are simple repeats or truncated TEs (6.7% in M. oryzae and 16.0% in maize), which may be due to indel/homologous recombination/sequence rearrangement. In other words, most of the PTEMD-detected sequence families in M. oryzae and maize are bona fide intact transposons. The core algorithm of PTEMD. (A) PTEMD-A, de novo active TE scanning pipeline. The high-throughput short reads are first mapped to the reference genome and the genomic regions correspond to mapping gaps (the dotted line indicated the gaps) are identified and classified into different repeat families with neighbour-join clustering. (B) PTEMD-B, de novo TIPs detecting pipeline. The middle panel represents the high-throughput reads which partially mapped to the TE sequence, the un-matched part of the reads were re-located to the reference genome sequences. There are two major mapping patterns: (i) the interval distance on the reference genome between left and right mapped reads is near or equal to 0 (top panel of B), representing a TIP in the re-sequenced individual; (ii) the interval distance between left and right mapped reads is equal or almost equal to the length of the TE (bottom panel of B), representing a same TE distribution between the reference and the re-sequenced individual. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The core algorithm of PTEMD. (A) PTEMD-A, de novo active TE scanning pipeline.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To determine the exact boundary of the classified TE sequences, we first align each classified sequence cluster to a clustalw27 format file using MUSCLE28; then we use a stringent criteria (at both left and right sides of the sequence cluster, the terminal base has at least 50% consistent within the sequence cluster) to get the longest consensus sequence of the cluster (Supplementary Fig. S2D). We then annotated the sequences by aligning them with NT/NR, Repbase, and maize TE database (http://maizetedb.org/~maize/), and manually classified them based on their structure, terminal sequences, and target site duplications (TSDs). Those classified sequences are the PTEMD-A-identified polymorphic TE families.The objective of PTEMD-B is to identify the TIPs. PTEMD-B aligns the high-throughput reads to the TE sequence (Fig. 1B, middle, detail parameter refer to BWA program MEM algorithm),29 the reads which partially mapped to the terminus of the TE sequence are selected from the re-sequencing data set, the un-mapped part of those sequences (Fig. 1B, highlighted with blue and green) are isolated and re-mapped to the reference genome sequences. There are two major mapping patterns; TE insertion only in the re-sequenced genome, and TE in the same location compared with the reference genome (Fig. 1B). For the detection of TIPs, it requires both sides of the flanking sequences mapped to the same location in the genome that lacks the insertion. As a result, the detected TIPs include only polymorphism created through indels including transpositions. The TIPs do not include sequence rearrangements caused by recombination, inversion, and translocations. In addition, due to the short length of the reads, it is impossible for the program to distinguish whether the TIP is caused by a full-length TE or a TE with internal deletions. In summary, by using the two-step approach, PTEMD is able to quickly scan polymorphic TE families and their insertion landscapes from high-throughput short reads. The output format of PTEMD-B is shown in Fig. 2, the file contains the detail insertion site/s, TSD, and all of the reads situated at ‘breakpoints’. Output format of PTEMD-B. (A) TE insertion without TSD. (B) TE insertion with a TSD ‘GAAA’. All of the reads information at the breakpoint region will be included in the PTEMD-B output file.Output format of PTEMD-B.

These seven data sets were then analysed by the PTEMD, and the results were used to evaluate the performance of PTEMD on the depth of re-sequencing data sets. A polymorphic TE family was defined as the presence of at least three TIPs in the reference genome compared with the re-sequenced data sets, with =97% sequence identity over 95% length. As expected, the number of TE families detected was positively correlated with sequencing depth (r= 0.98 ± 0.01, P = 0.00015 ± 0.00005, Fig. 3A). Although the number of polymorphic TE families continued to increase as the coverage approached ×50, the slope decreased, and at ×50 coverage, 15 TE families were identified in the M. oryzae genome. Among the 15 TE families, 14 represent intact TEs and 1 is a TE fragment (see next section and Supplementary Table S1 for details). The total copy number of those 14 intact TE families in rice blast reference genome is 905.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The average sequence identity between the genomes of HM-1 and HM-2 and that of reference genome was 99.97 ± 0.01%. It is estimated that some of the PETMD-A detected polymorphic TEs may be still active or recently active. To test this, we analysed a genetically purified, single-isolated data sets.30 Using PTEMD, we detected direct breakpoint reads evidences for MoTE-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -11 within 10–20 generations, indicated that more than half of the PTEMD-detected polymorphic TE families may still be active.To determine the false-positive rate of PTEMD-B, we used the 14 intact TE families, and identified TIPs and evaluated the false-positive of the TIPs. A TIP event was defined as a TE present in HM-1/HM-2 and absent in the rice blast reference genome.31 Using the same data sets as in Fig. 3A, we found that the number of TIPs detected was positively correlated with sequencing coverage (MoTE-1: r= 0.94 ± 0.05, P = 0.0014 ± 0.0018; MoTE-2: r= 0.95 ± 0.01, P = 0.0003 ± 0.0002; MoTE-3: r= 0.95 ± 0.007, P = 0.00045 ± 0.0002; MoTE-4: r= 0.73 ± 0.03, P = 0.04 ± 0.01; MoTE-5: r= 0.75 ± 0.03, P = 0.04 ± 0.007; MoTE-6: r= 0.90 ± 0.06, P = 0.004 ± 0.004). For example, the number of detected TIPs with MoTE-1 increased monotonically when the coverage increased but became saturated at about ×30 to ×50 in both HM-1 (Fig. 3B) and HM-2 (Fig. 3D). When the coverage increases beyond ×30, the number of PTEMD-detected TIPs still increases but at a declining rate. The number of detected TIPs for other TE families demonstrates the same tendency as MoTE-1 (Fig. 3B–E).To test whether an identified TIPs was authentic, we determined the false-positive rate of the predicted TE insertions by amplifying the expected fragments in the HM-1 or HM-2 genome with PCR. For experimental validation, we selected the MoTE-1 family because the insertion polymorphic rates of MoTE-1 for all three isolates (HM-1, HM-2, and the reference genome) were 100% (Fig. 4A, all of the MoTE-1 sequences are located in different regions). Among the TIPs involving the MoTE-1 family and detected by PTEMD-B, 60 TIPs from HM-1 and HM-2 were randomly selected for validation (Fig. 4A, the blue and red triangles represent the selected TIPs). If the predicted TIP was authentic, the difference in PCR product size between a fungal isolate with the TE insertion and a isolate without the TE insertion would be the length of MoTE-1, which is ~1.8 kb. Using M. oryzae reference genome sequences, we designed 60 primer pairs flanking the predicted insertion sites (Supplementary Table S2). The results showed that 100% of MoTE-1 TIPs in HM-1 and 93% of those in HM-2 represented true insertion polymorphism (Fig. 4B and C). To assess why two of the predicted TIPs in HM-2 (Fig. 4C, black arrows regions, 2-P6 and 2-P13) were not detected by PCR, we examined the sequence coverage for these two predicted TIPs and found that both had fewer supporting reads (2 and 3 breakpoint reads supported) than the validated insertions (=4 breakpoint reads supported, P< 0.01). Our finding indicated that the false-positive rate of the PTEMD-B is quite low at ~3.3% for the MoTE-1 family.

Comparison of PTEMD with other relative programsTo assess the proportion of polymorphic TE families in genome, we de novo detected all of the repeat sequences families in M. oryzae genome using RepeatMasker, Repeatscout, Piler, and RECON; 36, 79, 42, and 44 repeat families were identified, respectively (Fig. 5A, Venn diagram of the four program detected repeat sequence families), about half of the families are redundant, meanwhile, total non-redundant repeat families are 138 (Fig. 5B, the blue and blue-red overlapped region). Using PTEMD-A, we detected 14 polymorphic TE families. Among the 14 TE families, 12 families have highly similar (97% identity over 95% length) homologue within the 138 non-redundant repeat families, the other two families are only detected by PTEMD-A (Fig. 5B). In other words, only ~10% of the repeat families in M. oryzae genome are polymorphic TE families. The two polymorphic TE families that are only detected by PTEMD-A have low copy numbers (ranging from three to seven) in M. oryzae genome, and this explained why they are missed by other repeat scanning programs.

Using ×50 re-sequencing data sets (HM-1 strain) and the reference genome, we detected the TIPs for the 14 intact TE families using PTEMD-B, TEMP, RelocaTE, and T-lex, and 248, 266, 255, and 268 TIPs have been detected, respectively. Most of them (217 TIPs) are co-detected by all of the four tools (Fig. 5C, Venn diagram of the four programs detected TIPs), the non-redundant TIPs are 301, and only 9% (27 of 301) of the detected non-redundant TIPs are tool specific; these indicated that all of the four methods have the high-efficiency performance under high coverage of re-sequencing data set in M. oryzae genome. As a result, PTEMD performs better for repeat identification and is comparable for scanning of TIPs compared with other programs. However, since PTEMD is the only program that assumes both functions, it is the ‘one step’ tool for identifying polymorphic TEs and their insertions without the need of any other information except genomic sequences.3.3. Polymorphic TE families in the M. oryzae and maize genomesHaving demonstrated that PTEMD can detect polymorphic TEs that are likely to have been recently active, we next tested PTEMD with representative genomes. To assess the usability of PTEMD on genomes with widely different sizes and repeat contents, the genomes of M. oryzae (with a 40-Mb genome and 9.7% repetitive sequences)31 and maize (with a 2.1-Gb genome and over 85% repetitive sequences)32 were used.As mentioned earlier, we re-sequenced two field strains of M. oryzae (HM-1 and HM-2) at ×50 depth and compared the sequences to that of the reference genome. The average sequence identity between the genomes of HM-1 and HM-2 and that of reference genome was 99.97 ± 0.01%. Using PTEMD-A, we identified 15 TE families (Supplementary Table S1, 14 intact TE families and 1 partial TE family). To determine whether those 15 TE families were previously reported, we compared them with three databases: (i) Repbase, (ii) GenBank nucleotide sequences database (NT), and (iii) GenBank protein sequences database (NR). The results indicated that 14 families have matches in the Repbase/NT/NR databases (threshold: 1e-10) (Fig. 6). MoTE-2, -3, and -8 are previously reported transposons Pot2,33 Pot3,34 and OCCAN,35 respectively; another 11 (MoTE-1, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, -10, -11, -12, -13, and -14) are annotated in the M. oryzae genome sequencing project;31 4 (MoTE-1, -2, -3, and -8) are DNA transposons; 2 (MoTE-6 and MoTE-14) are related to LINEs; and 2 (MoTE-9 and MoTE-13) are LTR elements. We further verified/classified all 15 elements based on their structure, TSD, and similarity to known elements at protein level (Supplementary Table S1). All the four DNA elements are Pogo-like elements that belong to Tc1/Mariner-like superfamily. Three of the elements are Gypsy-like LTR elements. MoTE-9 represents an intact LTR element, whereas MoTE-13 represents a solo LTR. MoTE-15, on the other hand, only represents part of the internal region of a LTR retrotransposon, suggesting the detection of MoTE-15 is not due to TIP, but due to structural variation like indels among individual members of an element family. In other words, the fragment represented by MoTE-15 is not present in all elements, thus creates apparent indel polymorphism and is detected in the mapping process. All the remaining elements are LINEs or their deletion derivatives. Except MoTE-14, all the other seven families are related to MoTE-6. Interestingly, the seven elements all end with simple repeats (ACT)n (n = 5–9), which is different from the poly (A) tails of most known LINEs. This result indicates that PTEMD works well with small genomes like that of M. oryzae, and all the sequences recovered are bona fide transposon sequences albeit not all of them represent intact elements.

Over 85% of the maize genome, which is large in size (2.1 Gb), consists of repetitive sequences.32 In comparison with the Mo17 re-sequencing data set (GenBank accession number SRX245309) with B73 reference genome sequences, we identified 81 polymorphic repetitive sequence families (named ZmTE-1 to 81; sequences and their annotations are provided in Supplementary Table S3). The copy number in the reference genome is shown in Fig. 7. To determine the identity of those 81 sequences families, we compared them with four databases (Repbase, NT, NR, and the maize-specific TE database: http://maizetedb.org/~maize/). For those without matches in the database, we manually classify them based on their structure, terminal sequences, and TSDs. Overall, 75 (92.6%) out of the 81 families represent TEs (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S3) with 68 intact TEs and 7 partial TE sequences. The total copy number of those 68 TE families in B73 is 10,618. The five non-TE families are centromeric repeats, knob sequences, telomeric repeats, and local repeats. In addition, one family represents a chimeric structure from both DNA transposon and retrotransposon. Among the 75 TE families, 19 (25.3%) families are from retrotransposons and 56 (74.7%) are from DNA elements. The 19 retrotransposon families include one SINE, eight intact LTR retrotransposons, four solo LTRs, and six truncated or fragmented LTR elements (Supplementary Table S3). Two of the solo LTRs are similar to the high copy number LTR element Huck-2.36 One of the intact LTRs corresponds to Zeon-1, a moderate copy number element.37 If we consider the 6 truncated or fragmented elements likely derived from structural changes such as deletions, only 13 retrotransposons are polymorphic between Mo17 and B73 genomes. Among the 56 DNA elements, only one represents fragmented element, the remainder stand for intact elements, which are likely from recent transposition. This suggests that there are 4-fold polymorphic DNA transposons vs. retrotransposons. The 55 intact DNA elements are all small (<1 kb) non-autonomous DNA transposons including 51 miniature inverted TEs (MITEs). Notably, 41 (80%) of them are Tourist MITEs, which belong to PIF/Harbinger superfamily of DNA transposons. Several previously characterized DNA transposons are identified in this study, including Ds1, Heartbreaker, Heart healer, mPIF, Ruq-st , and the MITE that was found in maize Br2-3 allele.38–42 Finally, it is worth of mention that for either species, the output of PTEMD-A does not contain any composite elements such as nested insertions, which is likely attributed to the stringent criteria that we used to define a TE family (=97% identity over 95% length). Annotation and TIPs of 81 sequences families detected by PTEMD in maize. The annotation of each TE/repeats family is based on the most similar repeats in RepBase, NCBI NT and NR databases, and maize TE database. Other features are shown similarly as in Fig. 6.

TIPs in M. oryzae and maizeCompared with other TE sequences, polymorphic TEs create more TIPs in different individuals. To further assess the potential activity of TEs in M. oryzae and maize, we calculated the TIPs created by intact elements. By using PTEMD-B to compare the re-sequenced data sets of M. oryzae (HM-1 strain) and maize (Mo17) with their reference genomes, we detected 248 TIPs in M. oryzae (Fig. 8A, detail in Supplementary Table S4) and 1455 TIPs in maize (Fig. 8B, detail in Supplementary Table S5). The average TIPs per 10 Mb chromosome regions in M. oryzae and maize are 62.0 and 6.9 (Fig. 8C), respectively. We calculated the number of TIPs distributed in the genome (1 Mb windows was used), TIPs in both M. oryzae and maize were nonuniformly distributed (detail shown in Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). In M. oryzae, among the detected 248 TIPs, 91.1% (226 of 248) are caused by MoTE-1, -2, -3, and -4, albeit the copy number of those four TE families in reference genome contain only 32.2% (291 of 905) of total detected polymorphic TE sequences. And MoTE-1, -2, -3 are DNA transposons and MoTE-4 is a retrotransposon. In maize, among the detected 1455 TIPs, there were a total 539 TIPs derived from retrotransposons and 916 TIPs from DNA transposons. This was translated to 44 TIPs per retrotransposon family and 16 TIPs for DNA transposons. However, a close examination indicated that the majority (351) of TIPs from retrotransposons were attributed to ZmTE-4 and ZmTE-8 (Fig. 7); both are related to Huck-2 elements. If the two families were excluded, each retrotransposon family generated 20 TIPs, which was largely comparable to that of DNA transposons. As a result, the contribution to polymorphism of individual class I and class II elements was similar with the exception of Huck-2, which generated nearly 10 times more polymorphic insertions than other elements. Despite the presence of more polymorphic DNA transposon families as well as more TIPs from DNA transposons, the average size of polymorphic DNA transposons is only 311 bp, whereas that for retrotransposon is 3.8 kb, which is a dozen-fold that of DNA transposons. This explains why DNA elements contribute to much less genome size than retrotransposons in maize. The classification of the TIPs in M. oryzae and maize genomes.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To further identify the potential effects of TE insertions on gene functions, we first grouped the TIPs into four major classes: (i) TE insertions in the gene coding regions; (ii) TE insertions in the core-promoter regions (the 500 bp upstream sequence of the gene transcription start site)43; (iii) TE insertions in the intron regions; and (iv) TE insertions in intergenic regions. Then, we downloaded the GFF files for the three genomes and developed Perl scripts (available from the author of this paper) to extract and classify the TIPs. Because TE insertions in coding regions directly interrupt the genes, we expected that few of the TIPs would be located in coding regions. Among the 248 TIPs detected in the M. oryzae genome, however, 172, 34, 8, and 34 were inserted in intergenic regions, core-promoter regions, intron regions, and coding regions, respectively, and the percentages were 69.4, 13.7, 3.2, and 13.7%, respectively (Fig. 8A and Supplementary Table S4). This indicated that 30.6% of TIPs in M. oryzae genome were located in the genic regions. Among the 1455 TIPs detected in the maize genome (Supplementary Table S5), 72.0, 8.3, 16.5, and 3.2% were inserted in the intergenic regions, core-promoter regions, intron regions, and coding regions, respectively (Fig. 8B).4. DiscussionTwo methods can be used to determine whether a DNA fragment is a potential active TE.44 In the first method, researchers detect the fragment's activity by monitoring de novo insertions in the next generation. In the second method, researchers identify TIPs among individuals. We developed PTEMD to detect both polymorphic TEs and genome-wide TIPs using reference genomes and high-throughput reads data sets. Unlike previously developed library-based or structure-based methods, PTEMD identifies polymorphic TEs (PTEMD-A) and their TIPs (PTEMD-B) by searching all of the evidences of sequence movement at the TIP sites. PTEMD-A does not depend on any TE sequence or libraries. The program detects all of the mobile sequences by comparing the re-sequencing data with the reference genome and then classifies the sequences into clusters, which are filtered and classified into TE families. Our result indicated that, although non-TE sequences are included in the PTEMD-A output file, however, the proportion of non-TE families is low (6.7% in M. oryzae and 16.0% in maize), indicating that most of the PTEMD-A-detected sequences are intact polymorphic TE families. Moreover, we analysed the genetically purified, single-isolated re-sequencing data sets, and we found the direct evidences of current mobility for more than half of the PTEMD-A-detected TE families in M. oryzae. This indicates that many of the PTEMD-A-detected polymorphic TE families could be currently active.PTEMD-B maps the high-throughput short reads to the TE sequences and maps all of the partially mapped reads to the reference genome sequences. The position information is then analysed, and all of the TIPs including breakpoint evidence are presented in the PTEMD output file. As shown for the genome of M. oryzae and maize, only 6.7% (1 of 15) in M. oryzae and 16.0% (13 of 81) in maize of the PTEMD-detected mobile sequence families are not intact TEs; the polymorphism of those sequence families may be due to indel/homologous recombination/sequence rearrangement, in other words, most of the PTEMD-detected mobile sequence families are good candidates for active TEs.We integrated the cores of the Pindel,26 BWA29/Bowtie2,45 Muscle,28 and BLAST46 programs into the PTEMD program as the sequence-alignment engines. BWA is a widely used high-throughput reads alignment program that can quickly map high-throughput short reads to the reference genome sequences.29 The BWT-MEM algorithm is used in PTEMD to map the high-throughput reads to both the genome and TE sequences. Muscle28 is used in PTEMD for clustering the sequence families. BLAST46 is used to align the TE sequence to the reference genomes. The PTEMD output file contains all of the detected TE families and their detailed distribution positions including all of the supporting breakpoint evidence. The PTEMD output file is therefore useful for checking the raw sequence data of the identified TE families or new TE insertions.Previous programs have used three main methods for repeats scanning. The first method is a library-based approach, such as that used in RepeatMasker.12 The main drawback of programs that use these kinds of homology-dependent searches is that they can only detect sequences that are already known, i.e. they cannot detect completely novel elements. The second method is signature-based repeat searching, such as Piler.15 This method can search a query sequence for existing structures or motifs that are characteristic of a known repeat sequence, it can be used to find new repeats but not new classes of repeats. The third method is represented by k-mer and spaced seed approaches, such as those used in Repeatscout.14 This approach can de novo identify the repeat families based on genome sequences and has been widely used for scanning new TE families. Unlike these three methods, PTEMD is a homology-independent method that can scan active TE candidates (also including other polymorphic repeats) and their genome-wide insertion sites using high-throughput pair-end short reads and reference genomes. PTEMD therefore overcomes some important drawbacks of the previously published methods and will become an important tool for de novo polymorphic TE scanning.M. oryzae is a model pathomycete that can quickly overcome the host resistance.47 More than 80 resistance genes have been identified in rice but most of these resistance genes remain effective for only 2–3 years.48 A previous study provided evidence that a TE insertion into the promoter region of the avirulence gene Piz-t caused an avirulent strain to become to virulent49; however, the genome-wide polymorphic TE families and their distribution landscapes among different M. oryzae strains were still largely unknown. Using PTEMD, we identified 15 polymorphic TE families in M. oryzae (14 intact TEs and 1 partial TE). In reference genome, the 14 intact TE families contain 905 copies, and the total size of those TE families is ~1.5 Mb (3.8% of the M. oryzae genome). The top four TE families (MoTE-1, -2, -3, and -4) are widely distributed in strains HM-1 and HM-2. Further analysis of the dynamics and evolution of these top four TE families in field populations may help elucidate how these TEs affect M. oryzae virulence.To evaluate the performance of PTEMD with large and repeat-rich genomes, we identified 68 TE families in the maize genome are polymorphic and likely active in the recent past. The total copy number of the TE sequences is 10,618 in the maize genome. Those TE sequences cover 10.1 Mb of maize genome (0.48% of genome). Our results provide novel insights about the transposon biology. First of all, TE polymorphism varies greatly between the two tested species. The highest TE polymorphism is detected in M. oryzae: its genome size is only 2% that of maize but harbours 14 families of polymorphic TE families. Second, despite that most of the maize genome consists of LTR retrotransposons, DNA elements contribute more to polymorphism among different varieties compared with LTR retrotransposons. LTR elements make up the largest component of the genome due to their large size, not high activity. Third, not a single autonomous DNA transposon has been detected to be recently mobile in maize, and all the detected DNA transposons are very small (<1 kb) non-autonomous elements. Obviously, some of the autonomous elements in maize are still functioning because they are providing transposition machinery for non-autonomous elements. It is likely their large sizes make them less competent for transposition, consistent with the notion that DNA element size is critical for the transposition activity.50–52 Finally, the polymorphic TEs discovered using PTEMD can be used as potential novel tagging tools for breeding or studying gene function. As more and more genome sequences are available in the future, PTEMD will be an important tool in identifying polymorphic TEs in different organisms.AvailabilityPTEMD program, HM-1 and HM-2 strains' re-sequencing data sets (sequences in this study), and the genome-wide polymorphic TEs in M. oryzae and maize are freely and publically available at http://www.kanglab.cn/blast/PTEMD_V1.02.htm.FundingThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China to H.K.

IntroductionCopy number variations (CNVs) are deletions and insertions of genomic sequence between two individuals of a species.1–3 Substantial progress has been made in understanding the impacts of CNVs on both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility in human.4 The majority of previous studies of CNV in domesticated animals have been based on array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays.5–13 As in human,14 sequence-based approaches are becoming popular for the study of CNVs in domesticated animals.15–17The CNV distribution within and among species seems to be shaped by mutation, selection, and demographic history.18,19 However, unlike SNPs and microsatellites, the population genetics of CNV is largely unknown.1,20–23 Several studies have explored the evolution and adaptation aspects of CNVs in human,24,25 and other species.26–29 Only a few cases of recent positive selection were found near AMY1, APOBEC, MAPT, MIF, and UGT2B17 within human populations.30–33 While most of simple deletions and simple duplications (75–90%) display extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNPs,1,34,35 the properties of CNVs not tagged by SNPs remain unexplored in cattle. This is mainly due to the difficulty of genotyping CNV and to the limited sample size in the published CNV studies.As one of the most important farm animals, cattle are used for a variety of purposes including dairy, beef, leather, and labour. The majority of the global cattle population can be classified into one of two subspecies: humpless (taurine, Bos taurus taurus) and humped (indicine or zebu, Bos taurus indicus) cattle with dramatic phenotypic differences between them.36,37 Earlier studies indicated that these two subspecies diverged from the last common ancestor between 0.6 and 2 million yrs ago.38,39 There appears to have been two separate domestication events, with taurine cattle likely being domesticated in the Fertile Crescent ~8,000–10,000 yrs ago and indicine cattle in the Indus Valley ~6,000–8,000 yrs ago.40,41 A third independent domestication was proposed in Africa;42,43 however, a recent study did not support this hypothesis.44 Since the early 1800s, breed development has primarily been based on phenotypic selection on coat colour and polled phenotypes. More recently, the adoption of effective genetic selection programs and widespread use of artificial insemination resulted in bottlenecks followed by breed expansion. During the last 50 yrs, animal breeding based on quantitative genetics has resulted in remarkable progress in improving milk and meat production traits.45,46 Therefore, selective (natural and human-imposed) and non-selective forces (demographic events and introgression) have driven changes within the cattle genome. Their combined effects have created exceptional phenotypic diversity and genetic adaptation to local environments across the globe within the modern cattle breeds. For example, indicine cattle are better adapted to warm climates and demonstrate superior resistance to tick infestation than do taurine breeds.47 Likewise, beef and dairy cattle breeds display distinct patterns in selected metabolic pathways related to muscling, marbling, and milk composition traits. Although cattle genome evolution and demographic history have been explored from multiple aspects, the diversity and population genetic properties of CNV in cattle are still unexplored.In this study, we compare the diversity and population-genetic properties of CNVs in ~70 cattle individuals sequenced to medium coverage (mean ~11.8×). The data set includes multiple individuals from eight representative cattle breeds, representing both the major taurine and indicine breeds used for both dairy and beef purposes. It provides unprecedented genome-wide resolution to interrogate CNV and a unique opportunity to fully explore the population-genetic properties and evolutionary contributions of multicopy genes related to breed-specific traits.2. Materials and methods2.1. CNV calling, distribution, and association with other genomic featuresWe used a previously described segmentation algorithm to call CNVs.16,48 Detailed sample selection and CNV calling methods can be found in Supplementary Material online. Association between CNVs and SDs was tested by Spearman's rank correlation using 100 kb windows as previously described.49 Additional genomic features were obtained from public databases. Determination of the overlap between CNVRs and genomic features was performed as previously described.102.2. Population-genetic analyses and heatmap analysisInbreeding is a common feature in livestock due to selective mating and widespread use of artificial insemination. We filtered our samples based on known pedigrees constraining Wright's coefficient of relationship (r) to <0.25 to identify 69 unrelated individuals for the population-genetic analyses.During the CNV discovery phase, a total of 1,148,528 windows of 1 kb were identified across the whole genome. Population-specific CNVs were estimated using the statistic VST developed by Redon et al.21. VST is calculated by considering (VT - VS)/VT, where VT is the variance in normalized copy numbers among all unrelated individuals and VS is the average variance within each population, weighted for population size.We next selected the top 1% diverse 1 kb windows (n = 80) from the distinct CNV regions to perform CNV genotyping using the partitioning around medoids (PAM) function in R.50 A PAM procedure was used to cluster copy number ratios into discrete CN genotypes.21 Similarly, we partitioned the copy numbers of each 1 kb window into three clusters, representing the low, mid, and high ranges and then coded them using the 0, 1, and 2 matrix for SNP genotyping. Population clustering was then performed using STRUCTURE v2.3.3,51,52 assuming three ancestral populations (k = 3). This analysis between taurine and indicine cattle was initially run for values of the number of clusters (k) between 2 and 8. Each analysis was performed using 100,000 replicates and 100,000 burn-in cycles under admixture and correlated allele frequencies models. Reynolds' genetic distances among breeds were calculated using PHYLIP 3.69. To provide statistical support for the resulting clades, 10,000 bootstrap simulations were performed. The phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree 1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was conducted in PLINK 1.07 based on either CNV genotypes generated in this study or SNP genotypes generated using the same bovine HapMap populations as described previously.53NimbleGen array CGH log2 ratios were calculated for each probe on a custom 2.1 million probe array for all animals. The reference animal, in all cases, was the Hereford cow used to generate the cattle reference assembly, L1 Dominette. All log2 ratio values that spanned the GAT, GLYAT, and KRTAP9-1 genes were averaged across the gene's length for each animal individually. VST values contrasting taurine and indicine populations were calculated for these log2 ratios as previously described.21Heatmaps were generated using the estimated CN windows for each animal as described previously.16 The gplots (v 2.14.2) R package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html) was used to graph the CN values and generate heatmap representation of all lineage-specific gene duplications, deletions, and expansions identified in cattle breeds.2.3. Gene analysesGene content of cattle CNVRs was assessed as previously described.10 We performed DAVID analysis to test whether the terms were under- or overrepresented in CNVRs after Bonferroni correction.10 We identified the lineage-specific or lineage-differential gene families using a heuristic approach with our 75 analysed individual animals. We divided the animals into breed, subspecies, and purpose groups as listed in Table 1 and used a weighted search algorithm to highlight CNVRs with a high tendency to exist solely within a specific group. The weighted search was accomplished as follows: for each CNVR we calculated a sum score that represented a hypothesis that the CNVR was unique to a specific breed/subspecies based on the animals that shared the CNVR. For each breed/subspecies/purpose group (G), we counted the number of animals (A) from G that shared the CNVR and imposed a penalty (P) for each animal that was not a member of the current G. The sets of G that were tested consisted of dairy, beef, Angus, Holstein, Limousin, Jersey, Romagnola, Nelore, Gir, Brahman, Taurus, and Indicus (membership was not mutually exclusive within the groups). The summed weight of A–P was calculated for each G, and if it exceeded a threshold of 3, it was selected as a putative subspecies/breed-specific or differential CNVR. We also employed a statistical method (VST) to identify copy number variable genes within our data set. Based on the gene CNs from each animal, we identified gene families that were stratified by subspecies differences using the statistic VST, as described above.

Haplotype network analysisTo explore the diversity of haplotypes and evolutionary relationships across populations, we retrieved the high-density SNP array data for these eight breeds generated by the Illumina BovineHD SNP Consortium as described previously.53 Haplotypes and their frequencies were estimated separately for each breed using PHASE 2.1.54,55 To obtain reliable results, we employed an iterative scheme to perform inference with 10,000 iterations and 10,000 burn-ins, also we increased the number of iterations of the final run of the algorithm using option -X100, for details see http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/instruct2.1.pdf. Haplotype networks were constructed near functional genes such as GAT/GLYAT, ASZ1, AOX1, and FZD3. Phylogenetic relationships among the identified haplotypes were inferred through a median-joining network analysis using Network 4.6.12 (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com/).2.5. Data releaseAll array CGH data have been submitted to the gene expression omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number GSE62990. Raw data and population genetic and evolutionary analysis results are available upon request for research purposes. Raw reads were deposited under the SRA Bioproject PRJNA277147 in SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/).3. Results and discussion3.1. CNV discovery and experimental validationsAfter carefully excluding samples with low coverage in our initial survey, we focused on the remaining 75 individuals in our final data set (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 for sample information and sequence coverage). We identified CNVs using a sliding window approach based on the previously published MrsFAST-WSSD method.16,48 We discovered comparable average numbers of CNVs per individual across taurine (626.7) and indicine (591.2) cattle, suggesting our results based on the taurine reference assembly (UMD3.1) were not particularly biased against the indicine cattle. A full list of CNV calls (47,511) is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Data. After merged across samples, these CNVs yielded 1,853 CNV regions (CNVR), which represent 87.5 Mb (3.1%) of the cattle genome (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Data). We then calculated absolute copy number values for 1 kb windows across the genome for each sequenced individual (see Materials and methods). As anticipated, the average normalized genome-wide copy number was 2.15 ± 0.1 for all copy number windows. We successfully performed 75 quantitative PCR (qPCR, Supplementary Table S4) and 25 array CGH experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2) to assess the false-positive discovery rate for our data set as previously described.3,53 Detailed experimental validations can be found in Supplementary Material online. In summary, CNV calls made with sequence data were strongly correlated with array CGH data (r2 = 0.761) and had an estimated 12% false-positive rate and a 19% false-negative rate based upon qPCR and array CGH, respectively.We found that a large proportion of identified CNVRs (43.3%; 49.5 Mb) overlapped with the segmental duplication (SD) regions. We estimated pair-wise Spearman's rank correlations (Supplementary Table S5) of 0.084 and 0.098 for indicine and taurine CNVs and SD regions (both P<0.001<U+2060>), which were similar to the previously reported human results.49 A strong correlation of CNVs and SDs in cattle confirms that their formation mechanisms are mainly due to non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR).10,56 In the following analyses, we mainly focused on the characterization of the high-confidence CNVs from autosomes.3.2. Population genetics of cattle CNVsTo investigate the population genetics of CNVs, we first identified the frequencies of CNVRs in our data set (Supplementary Fig. S3). The average CNVR had a frequency of 29.3% (22 animals out of 75 total); however, the CNVR frequency tended towards a parabolic distribution with 835 CNVRs having a frequency =5% and 189 CNVRs having a frequency=95% in our data set (Supplementary Fig. S3). As expected, rare events were often observed in only one subspecies/breed, whereas common CNVs (frequency >5%) were usually shared across subspecies/breeds.To explore the population differentiation of CNVs between taurine and indicine cattle, we applied statistical measures of population differentiation using VST21 to our dataset in three ways: (i) estimation of VST for genome-wide 1 kb CN windows; (ii) clustering of the top 1% of VST values for 1 kb CN windows; and (iii) estimation of VST using the average CN for annotated genes. Estimates of VST for all genome-wide CN windows and all CNVRs revealed a number of outliers with levels of population differentiation suggestive of population-specific selective pressures (Fig. 1). Among these outliers were CNVs near AOX1, GAT/GLYAT, ASZ1, KRTAP9-1, and MCM4 (Fig. 1A). Population differentiation for copy number variation. Population differentiation, estimated by VST, is plotted along each chromosome for the two taurine and indicine comparisons: (A) RefSeq genes and (B) genome-wide 1 kb windows.

Example CNVs exhibiting high population differentiation are labelled. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We next selected the top 1% diverse 1 kb windows (n = 80)—identified by our VST calculations—from the distinct outlier CNVRs to perform CNV genotyping. The PAM algorithm is the most common implementation of k-medoid clustering, which is related to the k-means algorithm and the medoid shift algorithm.50 Previously, a PAM algorithm was used to cluster copy number derived from array CGH log2 ratios into discrete CN genotypes.21 Similarly, we partitioned the copy numbers of each 1 kb window into three discrete value clusters, representing low, mid, and high ranges and then coded them as 0, 1, and 2 values within a matrix for subsequent genotyping (Supplementary Table S6).Using CNV genotype calls from the top 1% diverse 1 kb windows within CNVRs, we performed population clustering (Fig. 2). The proximity of an individual to each apex of the triangle indicates the proportion of that individual's genome that is estimated to have ancestry from each of the three inferred ancestral populations. The clustering of most indicine cattle (BRM, GIR, NEL) in the right bottom apex reveals the clear discrimination between indicine and taurine cattle. In contrast, the taurine cattle were scattered along the opposing side with the exception of ROM near the centre. This distribution of ROM individuals agreed with previous results based on SNP genotypes,44 confirming that ROM has both taurine and indicine ancestries. It is also noted that ANG individuals were clustered together in the upper apex, while the other taurine cattle (HOL, LMS, JER) were dispersed around the left bottom corner, suggesting a distinction between different taurine breeds. It is possible that these two clusters differentiate between continental European breeds of cattle from UK breeds or beef breeds from dairy breeds; however, it is also possible that our selected CNV markers may be subject to cryptic founder effects within our ANG individuals. We suspect that the addition of African cattle breeds to this dataset will better resolve the taurine cluster by providing a third distinct lineage. Still, we note that the clustering results were structurally similar to our results obtained with high-density SNP data derived from the same bovine HapMap samples (Supplementary Fig. S4) and other recently published results.44 Based on the genotypes for these 80 loci (i.e. the top 1 kb windows) and using a neighbor-joining algorithm, we obtained a phylogenetic tree that generally agrees with the known cattle breed history (Supplementary Fig. S5). We also performed a MDS analysis based on CNV genotypes and compared it with the plot based on SNPs. Our plot confidently separated the indicine from the taurine cattle (Supplementary Fig. S6); however, the separation and clustering of the taurine cattle using CNVs were not superior to those based on SNPs, suggesting that CNV genotyping still has room for improvement.

This estimate was consistent with our initial genome-wide results that 90% of SD in cattle are tandem duplications in contrast to human and other primates, which show a preponderance of interspersed duplications.56 This led us to speculate that while it is challenging to systematically genotype cattle duplication CNV events as shown by Genome STRiP results in human,57 our relatively high cattle CNV genotyping accuracy is likely due to the vast majority of cattle CNV being tandem duplicates. Large tandem repeats or duplication CNVs in cattle could behave similarly like human tandem macrosatellites and multicopy genes. For these tandem duplications, it is likely that we made reasonable approximations of CNV genotyping calls by simply clustering the normalized copy numbers, as shown traditionally for macrosatellites and microsatellites.58–61 Additionally, the tandem distribution pattern could contribute to the high LD at CNV loci as suggested previously,62 thus the majority of CNV genotype calls could better represent local alleles. Combining these two factors, it is not surprising that our CNV-based results generally agree with SNP-based results. Of course, this hypothesis certainly warrants more investigation using larger sample sizes and other mammals like mouse and dog to further validate and improve CNV genotyping approaches.To provide an evolutionary perspective to our analyses, we also created heatmaps using the CN values for regions within selected gene loci (Supplementary Fig. S7). These analyses of lineage-specific or lineage-differential CNVs separate subspecies/breeds into groupings that are consistent with the generally accepted cattle history.443.3. Gene analysesWe evaluated genes overlapped by cattle CNVs (Supplementary Table S7) and selected genes with known functions (Table 2). We observed an enrichment of CNVs intersecting with genes (P < 0.0001; Spearman's rank sum correlation), consistent with reduced evolutionary constraints acting on functionally redundant gene categories. We next used DAVID to identify basic biological functional categories for 361 genes overlapped by our identified CNVRs.63 Like other mammals (human, mouse, and dog), statistically significant overrepresentations were observed for multiple categories including chromosome maintenance, immunity and cytoskeleton components (Supplementary Table S8). We then studied how variable genes were distributed across subspecies/breeds using either a heuristic approach based on CNV presence/absence or gene CN per individual (VST). Selected copy number variable genes identified from population sequence dataaVST was calculated from the comparison between the taurine and indicine individuals.bLiu, Hou, and Bickhart: we focused on the comparisons with the published CNV results based on the same bovine HapMap samples using array CGH,10 BovineHD SNP array,53 and individual NGS,16 respectively.Selected copy number variable genes identified from population sequence dataaVST was calculated from the comparison between the taurine and indicine individuals.bLiu, Hou, and Bickhart: we focused on the comparisons with the published CNV results based on the same bovine HapMap samples using array CGH,10 BovineHD SNP array,53 and individual NGS,16 respectively.3.4. Lineage-specific CNV genes based on a heuristic approachWe first identified lineage specific, copy number variable genes (CNV genes) using a heuristic approach (see Materials and methods). Dairy cattle-specific CNVs tended to be present at low frequencies in our 28 dairy cattle, and they manifested as small copy number changes of affected genes. Several of these dairy-specific CNVRs were found to intersect genes related to cellular growth and development pathways, including RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR)64 and TMED2.65 We also identified several lipid metabolism genes that overlapped CNVRs exclusive to beef cattle (over 40 samples). Within our Angus data set, we discovered six animals that had a predicted heterozygous duplication of PNPLA3 (the Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3). This gene is expressed in adipose tissue and liver, and is associated with the de novo synthesis of fatty acids.66 In indicine beef cattle (Nelore, Brahman, and Gir), we also detected a duplication in a predicted Ensembl gene (ENSBTAT00000043749) containing functional domains related to lipid metabolism.3.5. Gene family expansion, diversity, and evolutionWe identified copy number variable genes among the different subspecies/breeds using VST statistics. We defined highly stratified genes as genes having VST values >0.2. CN plots for these stratified genes showed clear differences in the average CN value for taurine and indicine animals (Fig. 3A). Based on VST values, ZNF280B, FBXO16, KRTAP9-1, MCM4, SERPINB4, CA1, FZD3, GLAYAT, GAT, MANBA, and DENR were the most stratified genes. To provide orthogonal experimental support for the sequence-based VST results, we also retrieved log2 ratios from array CGH data for the same animals. Representative results are shown in Supplementary Fig. S8 for the GAT, GLYAT, and KRTAP9-1 genes, further confirming the sequence-based VST results. Cattle gene family copy number diversity and evolution. The genes most stratified by copy number on the basis of VST analysis of taurine and indicine cattle (A). The most copy number variable genes in both taurine and indicine subspecies (legend insets denote group colors) tended to be immune system-related genes. Histograms showing the distributions of copy numbers among the unrelated individuals in each group are plotted for the KRTAP9-1 gene (B) and the MCM4 gene (C). X-axis values indicate copy number and Y-axis values indicate sample count. Individual copy number values for each gene can be found in Supplementary Table S7.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.CN stratified genes tended to be immune system related, which is expected given the different environmental challenges in the history of evolution of taurine and indicine cattle. One of these stratified CNVs represents a significantly higher duplication of the KRTAP9-1 gene in taurine cattle, which is a paralog of KRTAP9-2 that was previously reported to likely be involved in indicine tick resistance (Fig. 3B). A duplication of the MCM4 gene (Fig. 3C) was found in indicine cattle compared with taurine cattle. We also confirmed several other gene families appearing to be copy number variable, including lysozyme, defensin, and unique long binding protein (ULBP) families and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).Discoveries of high-frequency gene duplications suggest that the affected gene families are currently expanding in a ‘gene family birth and death’ model as described by Nei and Rooney.67 Such multicopy genes, if present in a sufficiently large proportion of the population, can be thought of as signs of diversifying selection or selection by overdominance.68 One example of this can be found in the Olfactory Receptor (OR) gene family, which has several member genes that detect odorant molecules through combinatorial binding across other paralogous family members.69 Therefore, the duplication and subsequent mutation of OR gene members allow for a greater range of odorant detection for a host organism. Indeed, out of 134 annotated OR genes, we have identified 31 (23.1%) individual genes that have predicted duplications in our data set.We have detected several additional gene families that appear to be subject to a high degree of duplication in our data set, and these families likely represent classes of genes that are in the processes of subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization in cattle. They include a cluster of prolactin-related protein family (PRP) genes that appears to be duplicated in 96% (74/75) animals. It was previously discovered using the BovineSNP50 array70; however, we refined the event from 2.4 down to 0.7 megabases in size. Another locus containing several pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) family members was found to be duplicated in all animals within CNVR 1717.3.6. Haplotype network analyses near selected multicopy genesIt is important to note that CNVs in some loci may have different alleles. Earlier results also suggest that the diversity of a subset of multicopy genes like human OR genes may have been maintained by balancing selection, in the form of overdominance.68 For example, a 660 kb deletion with antagonistic effects on fertility and milk production was recently found at high frequency in Nordic Red cattle, providing evidence for balancing selection of CNVs in livestock.71 To investigate the potential effect of overdominance on selection and evolution of multicopy genes, we further investigated haplotype evolution pattern using the BovineHD SNP array. We obtained 11 haplotypes within the 50.3 kb haploblock region near the GLYAT/GAT locus (Fig. 4A). The most common haplotype, H1 (with frequency of 70.06%), was mainly found in taurine cattle (HOL, ANG, JER, and LMS) and only minor portions were found in indicine cattle (ROM, BRM, GIR, and NEL) (Fig. 4A). H2 (with frequency of 10.56%) included a large proportion of taurine cattle (ANG, LMS, and ROM). We also observed two haplotypes exclusive to indicine cattle with a combined frequency of 10.54%: H3 and H4. Altogether, this pattern indicated that separate haplotypes were clustered only for the indicine cattle (BRM, GIR, and NEL), while other common haplotypes were identified for taurine cattle (HOL, ANG, LMS, JER, and ROM). BRM and ROM were the only exceptions, as they were often associated with both taurine and indicine cattle. This was not unexpected, as it mirrors the complex ancestral backgrounds of these two breeds, since BRM cattle are a known indicine breed with taurine influence and ROM share distinctive genetic ancestry with indicine cattle.44 We also found similar results for other copy number variable genes, such as ASZ1 (Fig. 4B), AOX1, and FZD3 (Supplementary Figs S9 and S10). These haplotype network analyses suggest that for a subset of multicopy genes: (i) common overlapping allelic haplotypes were often present within the taurine cattle, while separate distinct haplotypes were present in the indicine cattle, suggesting different evolutionary history for these two cattle subspecies; and (ii) there was high allelic diversity near multicopy genes maintained by balancing selection, in the form of overdominance, suggesting that they have been under different selection pressures in these two cattle subspecies.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.7. The impacts of the reference genome assemblyDifferent versions of cattle reference genome assemblies (Btau_4.0 and UMD3.1) have different RefSeq gene annotations, particularly in CN variable regions of the cattle genome. For example, the CATHL4 gene, for which we previously reported copy number change,16 was located on chrUn of UMD3.1. Since our RD method uses a window approach that relies on large genomic segments, this prevented us from assessing the copy number status of CATHL4 on chrUn. However, we did find CATHL1 was copy number variable in this study. Similarly, we were unable to assess the copy number of KRTAP9-2; however, we detected copy number changes for one of its paralogs, KRTAP9-1, in this study.3.8. Limitations and future directionsSimilar to SNP and microsatellite, CNV distribution within and among populations seems to be shaped by mutation, recombination, gene conversion, selection, and demographic history.18,19,28,72 However, CNV genetic markers may not be currently compatible with current population analyses, because CNVs violate the classical population genetics assumptions based on the infinite allele model and the infinite site model for SNP. Compared with SNPs, limitations of CNVs as markers were observed in this study probably due to their distinct mutation mechanisms, high mutation rates, heterogeneities among loci, and uncertainties related to allele calling. Similar observations were also reported for microsatellite—primarily due to similar limitations of detection and variability.73,74 For example, although NAHR is believed to be responsible for most of large duplication CNVs in cattle, inference, and predictions on the forces influencing populations require the modelling of the mutational process generating CNV. We currently lack such a model for the large duplications present in cattle. This is also compounded by the fact that homoplasy caused by recurrent events is expected to occur relatively often for CNV compared with SNP because of their high mutation rates.Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study represents one of the first attempts to genotype CNVs within large, diverse cattle populations using sequence data. Although beyond the scope of this study, a comparison with human-centric CNV genotyping methods using cattle sequence data will provide a useful contrast in approaches. Our results provide a new glimpse into the diversity of selective pressures during cattle speciation. We confirmed that cattle are strikingly diverse, despite relatively low estimated current population sizes for several taurine cattle as shown previously.37 Our population-genetic analyses based on CNVs reveal the population structures of these taurine and indicine cattle and uncover hundreds of CNVs showing elevated population differentiation near important functional genes. We highlighted several subspecies specific or differential CNV gene overlaps that are likely subject to subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. We also identified key regions of the cattle genome that are subject to variation and reported several potential genes affecting productive traits. These discoveries provide a basis for future efforts to genotype and track large CNVs in cattle. More sequencing data from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project75 or the analysis of additional outlier groups (e.g. African cattle breeds) will help to validate and refine the link between genomic copy number in these regions or different alleles with production and health traits.Authors' contributionsG.E.L. and D.M.B. conceived and designed the experiments.

IntroductionSite-specific recombination systems such as those based in Cre/lox from bacteriophage P1,1,2 Xis/att from bacteriophage <U+03BB>3 or FLP/FRT from Sacharomyces cerivisiae4 have been widely used for genome engineering in microorganisms, complex eukaryotic cells and mammals.5–8 In a first step, the modification including the recombinogenic sequences is introduced in the genome. In second transformation or transfection step, a recombinase coded in a suicide plasmid, a curable plasmid or any other delivery vector catalyzes a recombination between two site-specific recognition sites, thus generating the desired DNA integration, excision or inversion. It is also possible to have the recombinase as a transgene in the genome of the organism of study and introduce the recombinase by genetic crossing. However, this approach has to deal with the recombinase off-site effects and toxicity which have been broadly described.9–11 Among the different site-specific recombination systems, the Cre-lox shows a remarkable plasticity. Cre recombinase recognizes multiple loxP sites1,2 allowing the design of variant sites such as lox66, lox2272, lox71, loxN, loxLE or loxRE.12–16 All these variant lox sites have been tested for compatibility and recombination efficiency.Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging sexually transmitted human pathogen and is one of the free-living organisms with the smallest genome.17 Besides being the causative agent of non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal urethritis,18 this microorganism with a 580 kb genome is an appealing model of a minimal cell and synthetic biology studies, and it was one of the first organisms whose genome was fully sequenced19 and chemically synthesized.20 Multiple studies aiming to understand the cell function were developed with this microorganism, from the determination of non-essential genes in axenic culture21 to modelling the phenotype prediction from a genotype.22 This organism is also a model for system biology studies such as the ones performed to its close relative Mycoplasma pneumoniae.23–28Many genetic tools well established for other microorganisms are not available in mycoplasmas.29 Furthermore, most of the tools available, such as transposons, mini-transposons, replicative plasmids and suicide vectors for gene replacement rely on the incorporation of selective markers. These markers may interfere with the cell metabolism, and their use is a limiting factor for genome engineering given the low number of selection markers available. To circumvent these problems, we were aimed to implement the Cre-lox technology in M. genitalium by two different approaches. First, we used a suicide vector bearing Cre recombinase gene under the control of a constitutive promoter following similar procedures to those used in other organisms.30 Finally, we implemented a time-saving method based on TetR repressor by engineering the inducible Pxyl/TetO2 promoter previously used in Mycoplasma agalactie.31 This modified promoter tightly controls the expression of the Cre recombinase gene, which allows the introduction of both the desired mutation and Cre recombinase in a single step.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsEscherichia coli XL-1Blue was grown at 37°C in LB medium or LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin.32M. genitalium G37 wild-type strain (NCTC 10195) and its isogenic mutant derivatives (Supplementary Table S1) were grown at 37°C under 5% CO2 in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks containing 20 ml of SP4 medium.33M. genitalium was transformed as previously described.34 For mutant colony isolation, transformant cells were grown for 3 weeks in SP4 plates supplemented with 34 µg ml-1 chloramphenicol or 2 µg ml-1 tetracycline.2.2. DNA manipulationsDNA manipulations were performed according to procedures in Sambrook & Russell.35 Genomic DNA from M. genitalium was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. Bacterial DNA Kit (Omega BIO-TEK). Plasmid DNAs were obtained using the Fast Plasmid Mini Eppendorf Kit (VWR). Preparative amounts of plasmid DNAs were purified using the GenElute™ HP Plasmid Midiprep Kit (Sigma).PCR amplification was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and adjusting the annealing temperature according to the primers used (Supplementary Table S2). Purification of PCR products and DNA digested fragments from agarose gels was performed by using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel) kits. FastDigest restriction enzymes (Thermo Scientific) and T4 DNA ligase (Roche) were used according to manufacturer instructions.2.3. Plasmids constructionPrimers used in this work are in Supplementary Table S2. All the constructs below were screened by restriction analysis and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.p<U+0394>MG_217Cre (Supplementary Fig. S1A) was constructed as follows. First, TetR repressor under spiralin promoter control was amplified by PCR from pMT85-XTST31 using the primers 5 KpnI Pspi-TetR and 3 SpeI lox 66 PstI TetR, which incorporates the lox66 sequence between SpeI and PstI restriction sites. This PCR fragment was then digested with SpeI and KpnI to generate cohesive ends. Xylose promoter including TetO regions (Pxyl/TetO2) was amplified using the primers 5_KpnI_Pxyl/TetO2 and 3_NcoI_Pxyl/TetO2 from pMT85-XTST. This PCR product was KpnI–NcoI digested and ligated into a Litmus28 vector restricted with the same enzymes. Then, an ExSite mutagenesis PCR36 was performed using the primers 5_NdeI_TetO2 and 3_NdeI_Litmus28 to modify the inducible promoter by deleting the region from nt 7,200 to nt 7,276 of pMT85-XTST, which includes the RBS sequence, obtaining in this way the Pxyl/TetO2mod promoter cassette (Supplementary Fig. S3). Cre recombinase was amplified by PCR from pSH6214 using the primers 5_NdeI_Cre and 3_MluI_Cre and digested with NdeI and MluI. Chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) was amplified from pMTnCat37 using the primers 5_MluI_pmg438_CmR and 3_ApaI_lox66_SalI_CmR, which incorporate the sequence of lox66 between the ApaI and SalI restriction sites. This PCR fragment was then digested with MluI and ApaI. Pxyl/TetO2mod was excised from Litmus28 using the NdeI and MluI sites, mixed with the digested PCR products and ligated into a pBSK previously digested with SpeI and ApaI restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pBSK-TetR-Pxyl/TetO-Cre-cat. In a second step, a 919-bp PCR fragment containing the upstream homology region (UHR) and 60 bp of the 5' end of MG_217 was amplified by using the primers 5_XhoI_SacI_BE_mg217 and 3_SpeI_AscI_BE_mg217. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and SpeI. Another 976 bp PCR fragment containing the last 139 bp of MG_217 and the corresponding downstream homology region (DHR) was amplified using the primers 5_ApaI_BD_mg217 and 3_BamHI_NotI_BD_mg217 and further digested with ApaI and BamHI. Finally, both PCR fragments were mixed with the 2.9 kb SpeI-ApaI fragment from pBSK-TetR-Pxyl/TetO-Cre-cat and ligated to a pBSK previously digested with XhoI and BamHI.pMTnTc66Cat66 (Supplementary Fig. S1B) was constructed as follows. Cat gene was amplified by PCR from pMTnCat using the 5_SpeI_lox66_PstI_pmg438_CmR and 3_ApaI_lox66_SalI_CmR primers, which incorporates the sequence of lox66 between ApaI and SalI the restriction sites. This PCR product was digested with SpeI and ApaI restriction enzymes, mixed with EcoRI-SpeI digested tetracycline resistance gene excised from pMTnTetM43834 and ligated to the vector pMTn400134 previously digested with EcoRI and ApaI.pGmR (Supplementary Fig. S1C) was constructed as follows. The aac(6')-aph(2"") gene that confers gentamycin resistance was amplified by PCR from pMTnGm34 using the primers 5_BamHI_pM438-GmRshort and 3_BamHI_GmR_short. The amplification with these primers only include the ORF region (excluding the inverted repeats flanking the aac(6')-aph(2"") gene) and incorporate the MG_438 promoter at the 5' end. This PCR product was digested with BamHI digested and ligated to a BamHI-digested pBSK.pGmRCre (Supplementary Fig. S1D) was constructed as follows. Cre recombinase gene was amplified by PCR from pSH6214 using the primers 3_MluI_Cre and 5_pM438Cre, which incorporates the sequence of MG_438 promoter. The PCR product was then ligated to vector pGmR previously digested with EcoRV.2.4. Western immunoblotingTotal mycoplasma protein extracts were subjected to electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred electrophoretically to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore) previously activated in methanol and probed with a mouse polyclonal anti-MG217 antibodies38 at a 1:1,000 dilution. After primary antibody incubation, the membrane was washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween20 solution, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 1:5,000 dilution, washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween20 and revealed using Luminata Forte (Millipore) in a Imaging System VersaDoc MP 4,000 (Bio-Rad). Then, the same membrane was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-P41 antibodies39 at 1:1,000 dilution, washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween20 solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a phosphatase alkaline (PA) conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:5,000 dilution. After secondary antibody incubation, the membrane was washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween20 and revealed using NBT/BCIP Solution (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.5. Real-time PCRReal-time PCR (qPCR) reactions were carried out using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-rad) in a final volume of 10 µl containing 4 µl of a 10-4 dilution of genomic DNAs, 0.5 µM of each primer (Supplementary Table S2) and 5 µl of 2× SYBR Green Supermix. Reactions were run in a CFX384 PCR instrument (Bio-Rad) following a three-step PCR protocol including an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min and 40 cycles comprising a denaturing step at 95°C for 20 s, an annealing step at 56°C for 10 s and an extension step at 72°C for 10 s. Fluorescence readings were acquired at the end of each extension step, and the specificity of PCR products was verified by melting curve analyses at the end of each run.Genome quantification was performed using primers qPCR216F and qPCR216R annealing to MG_216, a control gene located at the 5' end of the target gene MG_217. Frequencies of genomes with excised cassettes were derived from qPCR reactions using primers qPCR_217BD_UPS and qPCR_217BE_DWS. Frequencies of non-excised genomes were derived from qPCR reactions using primers qPCR_217BD_UPS and qPCR_CmDWS. T-student statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software. For each condition, three biological repeats and two technical repeats were performed.2.6. Cell viability, induction of Cre expression and genomic DNA sequencingTo test Cre induction and expression, cell cultures were grown for 72 h in the presence of 0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ng ml-1 tetracycline. Then, cells were recovered and small samples were plated in SP4-agar and SP4-agar supplemented with 34 µg ml-1 chloramphenicol, incubated for 3 weeks as described above until colonies could be scored. T-student statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software. Genomic DNAs were purified from the remaining cells and used as template for qPCR assays. Five colonies from SP4 plates were also recovered and expanded to isolate genomic DNAs. Standard PCR reactions using the primers 5 screening D217 and 3 screening D217 were carried out to detect cassette excisions. All excisions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing performed at the Servei de Genòmica i Bioinformàtica, IBB-Parc de Recerca UAB.3. Results3.1. Stability of suicide vectors in Mycoplasma genitaliumSince no replicative vectors are available in M. genitalium, we tested whether a suicide plasmid delivered by electroporation and bearing a gentamicin resistance gene marker could remain inside the cells for limited periods of time. To this end, the plasmid pGmR was engineered (Supplementary Fig. S1C) and transformed on M. genitalium G37 WT cells. These cells were then incubated in the presence of gentamicin for 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 h and were finally plated in SP4-agar in the absence of antibiotic to quantify the number of viable cfus remaining after the gentamicin treatment (Fig. 1A). About 104 colonies were recovered from cells electroporated with pGmR, with no appreciable differences between the different gentamicin incubation times tested. In contrast, only a few colonies were recovered from non-electroporated control cells, particularly after the longest gentamicin incubation times. These results suggest that 104 cells incorporate the pGmR plasmid when delivered by electroporation, gentamicin marker remains functional inside these cells at least for several days, and gentamicin is killing most of the plasmid-free cells.

A 1,118-bp PCR band is expected from genomic DNAs bearing the cat gene and a 246-bp PCR band is expected in those genomes with a excision of this selectable marker.Persistence of a suicide vector inside M. genitalium cells and marker gene excision by Cre recombinase.

A 1,118-bp PCR band is expected from genomic DNAs bearing the cat gene and a 246-bp PCR band is expected in those genomes with a excision of this selectable marker.3.2. Evaluation of the Cre-Lox systemTo evaluate the feasibility of Cre-lox system in M. genitalium, we first obtained a mutant strain including an antibiotic marker gene flanked by two lox66 sequences. To this purpose, we engineered the minitransposon pMTnTc66Cat66 which carries the tetracycline resistance gene and also the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) that was flanked by two lox66 sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This minitransposon was transformed on M. genitalium cells and several recovered colonies were grown in liquid culture, and their DNAs were extracted and analysed by direct genome sequencing to confirm the presence of the minitransposon and to determine the genomic insertion points. One of the clones recovered was named TcloxCm and selected for further studies. On the other hand, we also constructed the suicide plasmid pGmRCre bearing the Cre recombinase gene under the control of MG_438 constitutive promoter (Supplementary Fig. S1D). This construct was expected to promote the expression of Cre recombinase once introduced to M. genitalium cells.Plasmid pMTnTc66Cat66 was designed to easily detect the cat cassette excision in TcloxCm mutants both by plating cells in a selective medium and by PCR amplification. Encouraged by the apparent stability of suicide vectors inside M. genitalium cells, we transformed a TcloxCm mutant with and without the pGmRCre plasmid and resulting cells were further incubated for 48, 72 and 168 h in the presence of gentamicin. TcloxCm viable cells remaining after the different gentamicin incubation times were also quantified, with results similar to those obtained when using pGmR plasmid (Fig. 1B). To assess the excision of cat cassette, five clones recovered from each experimental condition were checked by PCR. After 48 h of gentamicin incubation, all recovered clones showed a 1,118-bp PCR band consistent with the presence of the cat gene flanked by two lox66 sequences. Fortunately, after 72 and 168 h of gentamicin incubation, all recovered clones exhibited a single 246-bp PCR band consistent with the excision of cat cassette (Fig. 1C). These clones were able to grow in SP4 medium, but no growth was observed when they were cultured in SP4 medium supplemented with chloramphenicol, confirming also the absence of cat gene. None of the few clones recovered from control TcloxCm cells electroporated in the absence of pGmRCre plasmid and incubated with gentamicin showed the excision of the marker cassette (Fig. 1C). All these results indicate that Cre recombinase expression directed by pGmRCre plasmid has no noticeable toxic effects in M. genitalium cells, and this enzyme efficiently excises sequences flanked by lox in this microorganism.3.3. Cre expression under the control of an inducible promoterGenome engineering in a minimal cell model like M. genitalium would be greatly benefited from the existence of working constructs bearing an inducible Cre recombinase gene by providing a simple way to genetically modify cells in a single transformation step. As proof of concept, we chose to obtain an unmarked deletion of MG_217 gene, which has been previously shown to be easily deleted by homologous gene replacement.40 First, we designed the plasmid p<U+0394>MG_217Cre containing a cassette including the tetR repressor gene under the control of spiralin promoter,31 the Cre recombinase gene under the control of a tailored version of the inducible Pxyl/TetO2 promoter from pMT85-XTST31 (named Pxyl/TetO2mod) and cat gene as the selectable marker. Pxyl/tetO2 was engineered to minimize the transcriptional leakage exhibited by this promoter simply by removing the sequence including the ribosome binding site at the 3' end of this DNA fragment (Supplementary Fig. S3). With this modification, we expected a strong decrease in translation efficiency of Cre recombinase, greatly reducing the expression of this enzyme in the absence of inducer (Supplementary Fig. S4). The whole cassette, which was named Cre-cat cassette, was flanked by two lox66 sequences and enclosed by the same flanking regions previously used to obtain the MG_217 null mutant40 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). A double cross-over recombination event between plasmid p<U+0394>MG_217Cre and M. genitalium genome is expected to promote the deletion from bases 60 to 980 of the MG_217 gene (82.2% of the coding region) and the replacement of this region by the cassette flanked by lox66 sequences (Fig. 2A).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To obtain the <U+0394>MG_217Cre strain, WT cells were electroporated with p<U+0394>MG_217Cre plasmid and transformant colonies were isolated on SP4 medium containing chloramphenicol. Several colonies were expanded, and their genomic DNAs were analysed by PCR to check the presence of the intended replacement (Fig. 2A). All clones recovered showed a 5075-bp band consistent with the deletion of MG_217 gene and its replacement by Cre-cat cassette (Fig. 2B). To further confirm the deletion of MG_217 gene, a western blot was performed using the mouse polyclonal anti-MG217 antibodies.40 A 60 kDa band corresponding to MG217 protein was detected in G37 wild-type strain, but it was not present in any of the recovered clones (Fig. 2C).Preliminary time-course experiments revealed that most of the Cre-cat cassettes in M. genitalium genomes were found excised after 72 h of culture with 10 ng/ml tetracycline (data not shown). Next, several independent clones of <U+0394>MG_217Cre strain were grown for 72 h at different tetracycline concentrations to optimize Cre expression. These induced cultures were then plated in SP4-agar to quantify all viable cells and also in chloramphenicol-SP4-agar plates to quantify the viable cells still bearing the cat gene (Fig. 3A). In the presence of the lowest inductor concentration tested 70% of cells could grow in the presence of chloramphenicol, and only around a 10% of cells incubated with the highest tetracycline concentrations were still found resistant to chloramphenicol. The excision of the Cre-cat cassette was also quantified by qPCR (Fig. 3B), obtaining similar results and indicating that >90% of the cell population excised this cassette when incubated with tetracycline at concentrations higher than 1 ng ml-1. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of genomes with excised cassettes upon inducing Cre expression at 1, 10 or 100 ng ml-1 tetracycline (Fig. 3A and B). The presence of genomes with excised cassettes was finally checked by PCR in five isolated clones recovered after incubating with 10 ng ml-1 tetracycline for 72 h. These clones showed a 2195-bp PCR band consistent with the excision of Cre-cat cassette (Fig. 3C). We also determined the sequence of the excised cassettes by direct Sanger sequencing of genomic DNAs from these clones. Sequence analyses demonstrated that all the clones analysed have the same DNA sequence inside the excised cassettes (data not shown). All these data taken together indicate that Cre expression is efficiently induced in the presence of tetracycline, and the amounts of recombinase produced are enough to precisely excise DNA regions flanked by lox66 sequences. Cre recombinase expression tests. (A) Cell cultures containing several isolates of <U+0394>MG_217Cre strain were grown with 0, 0,1, 1, 10 or 100 ng/ml tetracycline for 72 h and plated in SP4-agar plates and in SP4-agar plates supplemented with 34 µg/ml chloramphenicol.

Outline and expected bands are shown in Fig. 2A.3.4. Stability of lox66 cassettes in long-term uninduced culturesSome applications using the Cre-lox technology may require a strict control on Cre recombinase expression. To obtain quantitative data about the transcriptional leakage of Pxyl/TetO2mod promoter in <U+0394>MG_217Cre strain, the stability of Cre-cat cassette in this strain was tested after 1, 6 and 11 serial culture passages in the absence of inducer and chloramphenicol. Cells from these culture passages were plated in SP4-agar and chloramphenicol-SP4-agar, and no statistically significant differences in the number of viable cells plated in both conditions were observed at the different culture passages (Fig. 4A). A more precise quantification of the genomes with excised Cre-cat cassettes was made by qPCR. Only a 0.53% of the cell genomes isolated after the first culture passage exhibited excised cassettes. The number of excised cassettes slightly increased in the cell genomes isolated after 6 and 11 serial passages, showing frequencies of 1.36 and 4.50%, respectively (Fig. 4B) and indicating that Cre expression in <U+0394>MG_217Cre cells is strongly repressed in the absence of inducer.

DiscussionMycoplasmas are widely used for synthetic biology studies including modified genome transplantations.21,22,41–43 Although their genomes can be synthesized chemically with the desired mutations and then assembled in yeast cells,20,43 this is a difficult and time-consuming process that may not apply for high-throughput studies. Furthermore, transposition or gene replacement is nowadays a quicker, easier and cheaper way to obtain genetic modifications. Since Cre-lox technology is not currently available in mycoplasmas, we chose to adapt this friendly user technology as a new genetic tool for working with these microorganisms. Among multiple benefits, the Cre-lox system makes possible the removal of marker genes, allowing multiple rounds of genome editions. In this way, combining Cre technology and either homologous gene replacement or transposition may allow in minimal genome studies to introduce sequential gene deletions after removing the marker genes.As the first step to implement the Cre-lox technology in M. genitalium, we tested the Cre expression when delivered by suicide plasmid44 and demonstrated that cells transformed by a suicide plasmid remain viable in the presence of a selective medium for several days (Fig. 1A and B). Our data also indicate that >99% of viable cells recovered in the presence of a selective medium were transformed with the suicide plasmid, suggesting that the background of these experiments was very low, being the frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant cells lower than 1% of viable cells. This suicide plasmid was also proved a very effective way to promote the Cre recombinase expression inside mycoplasma cells since all examined clones showed the excision of a lox66 cassette 48 h after plasmid delivering (Fig. 1C). Since no excision of this cassette was detected in the absence of the suicide vector, we can discard the presence of intrinsic Cre-like recombinases in M. genitalium.Once it was demonstrated the Cre recombinase function in M. genitalium, we developed an all-in-one vector to introduce in a single transformation step both a genome modification and an inducible version Cre recombinase gene. This saving-time technology would be especially interesting for those microorganisms with slow growing rates like mycoplasmas. To this end, a Cre-cat cassette was designed to include a Pxyl/TetO2 tetracycline-inducible system31 which was modified to improve the control on Cre expression. The presence of Cre-cat cassette did not interfere in the gene replacement experiments, and the <U+0394>MG_217Cre mutant was obtained with a transformation efficiency of 2 × 10-7 per viable cell, virtually the same transformation efficiency that was described in a previous report.40 In addition, this mutant exhibited the same phenotype as previously described (data not shown) suggesting that the presence of Cre-cat cassette is not toxic for mycoplasma cells and no polar effects are produced on MG_217 flanking genes. We also tested the effect of different tetracycline concentrations when inducing Cre expression by quantifying the frequency of the cassette excisions in genomes of <U+0394>MG_217Cre cells. Cre expression was detected at tetracycline concentrations as low as 0.1 ng ml-1, and the maximum expression rate was reached at concentrations close to 1 ng ml-1, which is 200 times below the minimal inhibitory concentration of this antibiotic in M. genitalium.34 When using Cre-cat cassette in microorganisms very sensitive to tetracycline, this antibiotic might be replaced by anhydrotetracycline, a less toxic tetracycline analogue45 that can also be used to induce Tet promoters.Implementing the Cre-lox system in mycoplasmas opens a new horizon in the study of these minimal microorganisms. With this technology a huge variety of genome modifications, such as insertions, deletions, translocations and inversions at specific sites, can be achieved now in mycoplasmas. Once demonstrated that lox66 sequences and Cre recombinase are functional in M. genitalium, it seems feasible to use a combination of lox66 and lox71 sequences. Recombination between these two lox sites generates an inert lox72 sequence, which presents extremely reduced recombination efficiency.12 Although a huge repertory of non-compatible lox sequences is currently available,12,13,15,46 the lox72 seems the most suitable sequence to obtain an unlimited number of genetic modifications without interferences between different lox sequences.12The RBS sequence at the 3' end of Pxyl/TetO2 was removed to obtain a promoter with an improved control on the expression of target genes. The leakage of the modified version of this promoter was tested using a very sensitive assay. This assay was designed to detect and quantify by qPCR the frequency of excised Cre-cat cassettes in serial passage cultures of <U+0394>MG_217Cre cells in the absence of inducer. After 11 serial passages, i.e. more than a month of continuous cell culture, only 4.5% of the total cell population underwent a cassette excision. As only four molecules of Cre recombinase are needed to perform a site-specific recombination,47 our results suggest that Cre expression is tightly controlled. In addition, if the Cre-cat cassette is wanted to be strictly maintained, the addition chloramphenicol to the culture medium would kill those cells bearing excised the cassettes, resulting in a negligible cell mortality rate at every passage. Finally, the modifications introduced in Pxyl/TetO2 also make this inducible promoter a promising tool for other molecular applications. A tight control of the expressed genes is essential to develop conditional knock-out mutants to study the function of essential genes, the introduction of inducible counterselectable markers and the evaluation of mutant phenotypes after inducing the expression of target genes in time-course experiments.FundingThis work was supported by grants BIO2013-4870R and BIO2013-50176EXP from the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad.

IntroductionPlant domestication establishes a vital co-dependence between humans and plants.1 Previous studies of the plant domestication process have focused mainly on seed-propagated annual (herbaceous) species, often with the goal of identifying wild progenitors, as well as changes in genetic structures associated with domestication.2–5 The results have provided historical insights into the genetic adaptation required for domestication, which has relevance to crop breeding strategies. During the domestication and early breeding process, crops typically experience population bottlenecks, including extensive artificial selection for improved crop quality and local adaptation.6 Evidence of this selection remains in the patterns of genetic diversity within cultivated genomes,7 as characterized for major crops such as rice,8,9 wheat,10 and maize.11–14 These studies also identified important genomic regions and/or genes associated with artificial selection. Genes under strong selection reflect the main driving forces for each historical differentiation. Thus, their detection can provide valuable targets for further crop improvement research,15 as well as opportunities to improve current genomic selection (GS) models.16 Conventional mapping approaches such as genotype–phenotype association mapping, though effective for identifying loci contributing to specific traits, are not as applicable to diversified populations with their large variety of genetic structures.15 For approaches using linkage mapping, perennial plants present additional challenges because of their large size and long generation time. Thus, genome-wide association study (GWAS)17,18 used in conjunction with analysis of the effect of selection on the genomes of current populations may be a good strategy for identifying critical loci defining perennial crops.In contrast to those for annual crops, studies depicting paths of domestication for perennial plants, including tree crops, are rare.18–22 Trees have unique features affecting their manner and rate of domestication: (i) individual genotypes can be maintained by vegetative or clonal propagation, (ii) trees have a long generation time, frequently with a long juvenile phase, and (iii) wild populations are often large with high levels of gene flow.23–25 Additionally, different reproductive systems and cultural practices among species may have led to substantially different effects on domestication and breeding pathways. A typical example for reproductive systems is self-incompatibility (SI), which promotes outcrossing. Outcrossing generally disturbs the fixation of selected alleles and the resulting domestication.26 Rowlands hypothesized that important crops undergo breakdown of SI during domestication and/or breeding, owing to artificial selection for stable production in more homozygous lines.27 It has been proposed22 that the domesticated apple did not experience a population bottleneck in the domestication step, presumably because of its long generation time, the nature of the SI system, and breeding practices such as selection from open-pollinated seed (leading to ‘chance seedlings’). Similarly, domesticated grapevine shows only a weak bottleneck, partially because of specific cultural practices including the maintenance of many old varieties with wide genetic diversity.18 It has been proposed that tree crops are, in general, less affected by population bottlenecks and other selection limitations during the domestication process.21,22Peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] is one of the most important tree crops worldwide. It is in the Rosaceae family, which also includes apricot, almond, plum, strawberry, rose, pear, and apple, and has been reported to have been cultivated for >4,000 yrs.28 Archaeological findings support the domestication of peach and its artificial selection for various desirable traits in China from as early as 1000 BC,29 although there are only a few reports on specific origins or required traits for domestication.30 Modern varieties of cultivated peach are conventionally categorized into two main groups: fruit varieties and flower-ornamental varieties, though this grouping does not consider genetic structure. For fruit varieties, many regional cultivars exist. However, most modern cultivars in Europe and North America appear to have originated from only a few old cultivars used in early twentieth-century North American breeding programs.28,31 Based on molecular marker data, cv. Chinese Cling has been proposed as an important founding parent in these early breeding programs.32,33 In Asia, cv. Chinese Cling has also been proposed to be a founding parent of numerous modern cultivars,34–36 though it should be mentioned that this designation may refer to multiple independent landraces and local selections.37 The exact identities of many old cultivars and classification names reported in the older literature remain confusing given that they have been cultivated in China for thousands of years, often with multiple introductions to Western countries.38 For the flower-ornamental peach group, little is known about the genetic structure and genetic diversity, except for some limited cultivars and landraces.30Artificial selection is expected to occur not only during domestication but also in subsequent breeding for specific objectives. In domesticated chicken, genome-wide comparison of genetic diversity during recent breeding differentiation to layers or broilers revealed multiple independent targets of artificial selection.39 The recent availability of genome-wide scans of plant species’ DNA polymorphisms allows for a more detailed study of their population genetics, including characterization of linkage disequilibrium (LD) as well as genetic diversity, including pi-values for the detection of targets of selection during plant domestication.9,10,30,40–42 The objective of this study was to better characterize the genetic structure of peach and to identify important selection events during domestication and subsequent cultivar differentiation, using a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip-based approach.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collection and genome-wide genotypingFor genome-wide genotyping, leaves were collected from 67 accessions of domesticated peach (P. persica; subg. Amygdalus), 20 accessions of peach relatives (four Prunus davidiana, one P. kansuensis, 12 P. mira, one P. tangutica, and two P. webbii; subg. Amygdalus), and 8 accessions of outgroup species [two Japanese plum (P. salicina; subg. Prunus), two Japanese apricot (P. mume; subgen. Prunus), and four sweet cherry (P. avium; subg. Cerasus)], from the UC Davis and USDA Prunus germplasm collections in Winters, California, USA, the NIFTS Prunus germplasm collections, Tsukuba, Japan, the Research Institute for Agriculture Okayama Prefectural Technology Center for Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Akaiwa, Japan, and the experimental orchard of Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, as summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Tissues from a total of 95 accessions were subjected to DNA extraction using Nucleon PhytoPure (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) and thereafter phenol/chloroform extraction.Genotype calling was performed with an Illumina infinium peach 9K SNP chip, which was defined from a total of 1,022,354 SNPs that were identified from the resequencing data in a wide variety of 56 accessions in Amygdalus, mainly including peach (P. persica) and almond (Prunus dulcis), and ~75% of genic SNPs were verified in the peach genome.43,44 We assayed 7,873 SNPs in this study. Each 5,180 and 6,605 informative SNP was selected for structural analysis and evaluation of LD and selective sweeps, respectively (see below).2.2. Allele pruningSNPs showing >5% missing data or <0.05 minor allele frequency (MAF) in domesticated peach cultivars were pruned with PLINK.45 After filtering, 6,605 SNPs remained for use in estimating LD. SNP pairs showing strong LD were further pruned by defining a window of 50 SNPs, removing one of a pair of SNPs if R2 > 0.5 (VIF threshold values = 2), and then shifting the window by three SNPs and repeating the procedure using PLINK. After filtering, 5,180 SNPs remained for use in the analyses of population structure.2.3. Analysis of population structureFor the topology of the evolutionary tree, we aligned 5,180 concatenated SNPs to give two aligned positions for each SNP locus to reflect the diploid allelic states. The aligned concatenated sequences were subjected to neighbour joining (NJ) using version 5.05 under the Poisson matrix with gamma distribution for the rates and with 1,000 bootstrap replications. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the same 5,180 SNP set, using prcomp implemented in R version 2.15.3. Heterozygosity [expected (HE) and observed (HO)], inbreeding coefficient (FIS), and Weir & Cockerham F statistics (FST) were calculated with GENEPOP 4.0.46,47 Identity by descent (IBD) proportions were calculated as pi-hat values with PLINK, considering all pairings of the 67 accessions of domesticated peach (P. persica). We used the pruned 5,180 SNPs for the calculation. We had no calibration to infer first- or second-degree relationships from the information of actual pedigrees owing to the lack of information on reliable pedigrees and to the small number of accessions.To evaluate delimitations in population structure, we performed individual-based Bayesian clustering with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, using STRUCTURE 2.248 and InStruct49 to infer the population ancestry of genotypes in K predefined clusters. K values ranging from 2 to 10 were evaluated for subdivision of the full (domesticated or wild) peach population (n = 87). We fixed K at 2 for characterizing proportions of ancestry from two predefined ancestral gene pools in some combinations of the varietal complexes or of the resulting clusters, to support population subdivision, and to infer genetic introgression among the complexes according to Cornille et al.22 We performed an independent test of each K using at least 200,000 MCMC iterations after 50,000 burn-in iterations. To evaluate inference of K, the model with the highest ln Pr(K)48 and the <U+0394>K model with the greatest second-order rate of change in ln Pr(K)50 were examined.Pairwise LD among the SNPs were calculated with PLINK, using 6,605 SNP sets considering MAF (<0.05) and missing reads (>20%) in the full population as candidates. We exploited all R2 values in all pairs of SNPs in 10,000-kb windows. The R2 values were independently calculated for each subpopulation for each chromosome. The LD decay distances in each domesticated peach subpopulation, in the whole domesticated peach population, and in a wild related population were defined as the first points at which the average R2 values in a 100-kb bin revealed no significant difference (P > 0.1) against the background R2 values, which were calculated from average intra-chromosomal comparisons.2.4. Haplotype phasingWe characterized haplotypes of SNPs in each chromosome with fastPHASE v.1.2 using 6,605 SNP sets considering MAF and missing rates in the entire population.49 In advance and against the full population, including 87 wild or domesticated accessions, we estimated imputation error rates using 1,583 SNPs on chromosome 4 and the following options in fastPHASE: number of random starts of the EM algorithm = 10, EM iterations = 25, lower limit numbers of clusters = 1, upper limit numbers of clusters = 20, and interval between values for number of clusters = 1. This analysis gave an imputation error rate of 0.0822 with K = 8 as an optimal condition, only slightly larger than the values reported for phasing of SNPs on grapevine chromosome 8 and in humans.18,51 We adopted K = 8 and constructed haplotypes for each chromosome. Construction of haplotypes was also performed using each subpopulation defined in structure analysis (see Results section), which often showed a lower imputation error rate (ca. 0.06–0.17) than the full population.2.5. Detection of selective sweepsHere, S is the number of SNP positions in a window, N(m)maj and N(m)min are the numbers of major and minor alleles, respectively, in mth SNP locus in a window. Individual Hp values were then Z-transformed as follows: ZHp = (Hp - µHp)/sHp, according to a report on pooled heterozygosity for selective sweep analysis in chicken.39 The allele information was used in an unphased state.Both iHS and XP-EHH tests were based on EHH, which is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen chromosomes carrying the core haplotype of interest are identical by descent (as assayed by homozygosity at all SNPs) for the entire interval from the core region to point x.52 We detected EHH in each subpopulation using the program Sweep.53 We approached the computation of the integral of observed EHH (iHH)54 in 1,000 kb from each SNP core by measuring EHH in every 100-kb bin. EHH decayed to below 0.05 by 1,000 kb from SNP cores in most cases.For detection of iHS, iHH values from two core alleles at one SNP core position in one population were defined as iHHA and iHHD, which originally corresponded to ancestral and derived alleles, respectively.54 iHS statistic is then given as unstandardized iHS=ln<U+2061>(iHHA/iHHD) (1).54 Finally, we obtained the standardized iHS as a Z-transformed value of the unstandardized iHS. We examined the reciprocal states of two core alleles (iHHA and iHHD) because of the sparseness of information on the derivation of the core alleles among peach subpopulations. XP-EHH is also obtained by Equation (1), focusing on the same core alleles in comparison to two populations.53 For two populations, A and B, the log values of the integral EHH, IA and IB (like iHHA and iHHD in the iHS test), ln(IA/IB) give an index of selection specific to either of the two populations. An unusually positive value of ln(IA/IB) suggests selection in population A, whereas a negative value suggests selection in population B. The standardized XP-EHH is given as a Z-transformed value of ln (IA/IB), the details of which are presented by Sabeti.53 The standardized iHS and XP-EHH were transformed to P values using R for graphical plotting.2.6. Sequencing and genetic diversity analysis in selected regionsTo exploit genes under selection during cultivar differentiation, full lengths of a total of 15 genes located on the region under putative selection were amplified by PCR using 30 peach accessions (Supplementary Table S3a) and then sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) as paired-end 100 (PE100). The libraries were constructed based on in-house-developed protocols described previously.55 Approximately 4% of a sequencing lane was dedicated to all samples to yield at least 100× coverage in any region. Over 15% of read coverage for each SNP was considered as informative. All bioinformatic and statistical analyses were performed on local servers at the UC Davis Genome Center (Davis, CA, USA). Raw reads without adapter sequences were subjected to trimming (length > 35 bp, mean sliding window of 5 bp phred quality score =20) using custom Python scripts. Reads were then mapped to the reference sequences from the peach genome (Peach v1.0) using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) tools.56 Informative SNPs were identified using Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) tool57 and custom Python scripts. Informative SNP strings and statistics for selective pressure (nucleotide diversity (p) and Tajima's D) were evaluated with DnaSP 5.1 using sequence alignments constructed with ClustalX version 2.0 with minor revision using SeaView version 4, according to previous studies.8,12,58,593. Results3.1. Genotyping and defining the genetic structureThe topology of the evolutionary tree, constructed using 5,180 concatenated SNPs, showed distinct differentiation between peach and its wild relatives and also among the cultivar complexes, based on classical classifications by morphology or use (Fig. 1). Six major clusters were defined in the evolutionary tree: wild species (W), landraces (L), modern fruit cultivars (F), and modern ornamental cultivars (O-A and O-B for only ornamental usage and FO for fruit and ornamentals). The F (including FO) and O-A clearly diverged from landraces with strong statistical support (with bootstrap values of 70/100 and 74/100, respectively). The L clade was divided into two clades, of which one contained mainly East Asian cultivars (L-EA), and the other (L-OT) showed no specificity for geographic distribution. Some ornamental cultivars (O-B) were included in clade L-EA. Note that two wild species (P. davidiana 2325-21A, and P. mira 2228-21A) were located near or in landrace clusters, probably because of recent frequent hybridization with domesticated peach cultivars or ancestral shared polymorphisms, as supported by PCA and STRUCTURE analyses (see below). Evolutionary tree of domesticated peach and its wild relatives. Evolutionary tree constructed by a maximum likelihood (ML) approach using information from 5,180 genome-wide SNPs in 87 accessions of domesticated peach (Prunus persica) and five wild species (P. davidiana, P. mira, P. kansuensis, P. tangutica, and P. webbii), with 8 accessions of outgroup species (P. salicina, P. mume, and P. avium). Operational taxonomic units (OTU) are colored in ocher, black, green, blue, and red, for major clusters: wild species (W), landraces (L) (EA and OT for accessions in East Asia and other region, respectively), modern fruit cultivars (F), and modern ornamental cultivars (O-A and O-B for only ornamental usage, and FO for fruit and ornamentals), respectively, according to the tree topology, and to classical classifications considering uses and morphologies. The main differentiation steps of the domesticated peach, the East Asian cultivars (including modern cultivars), the O-A cluster, and the F cluster, are shown as black, green, red, and blue thick branches, respectively, with statistically significant support (bootstrap > 650/1,000, except for the differentiation to the East Asian cultivars).Evolutionary tree of domesticated peach and its wild relatives.

PCA analysis showed distinct differentiation of the W clusters from P. persica with two exceptions (P. davidiana 2325-21A and P. mira 2228-21A) (Fig. 2A for the first two principal components). In addition, this analysis revealed that the F, FO, and O-A clusters had genetic structures that were distinct from those of the others, although O-A may have experienced some hybridization with the landraces in East Asia or ancestrally shared polymorphisms with them (Fig. 2A). The results of population structure analysis by STRUCTURE 2.2 and InStruct, assuming subpopulation K = 2–10 distinct clusters, were consistent with each other, and supported almost the same conclusion as in the evolutionary tree and the PCA (Fig. 2B and C, for K = 2–7). Model selection based on the <U+0394>K and ln Pr(K) supported K = 6 (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). With K = 5 or less, ornamental cultivars and landraces were not clearly separated, whereas with K = 7, they displayed different population structures, although some genetic hybridization was likely (Fig. 2B and C, Supplementary Fig. S1C for comparison of the O and L-EA clusters in predefining two ancestral gene pools). The FO cluster was inferred to have experienced clear hybridization with the F and O/L-EA clusters in K = 4–7, a reasonable inference, given that they originated by recent hybridization between fruit and ornamental cultivars (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Two accessions of wild species, P. davidiana 2325-21A and P. mira 2228-21A, appeared to have experienced recent hybridization or ancestrally shared polymorphic alleles with landraces at K = 7, and for K = 2, their structures were almost the same as that of the domesticated P. persica (Fig. 2B and C). The FST test supported frequent hybridization in the FO cluster and the F and L-EA clusters and suggested significant differentiation in the domesticated peach (P. persica) from wild relatives (FST = 0.268 and 0.275 from P. mira and P. davidiana, respectively), and in F and O-A (FST = 0.158 and 0.135, respectively) from the landrace L-EA (Table 1), relative to the FST values for other tree crops and wild relatives.18,22 Also, the O-A and O-B clusters, both of which are categorized as ornamental varieties, showed distinct differentiation (FST = 0.228).

In K = 5 or more, the F, L-OT, and O-A/O-B/L-EA clusters show clear separation. The O-A and O-B/L-EA showed significant separation at K = 7 or more.Based on these population structure results, the O-B cluster was included in the L-EA (or L) cluster and the F-O was no longer considered because at least one of them originated from the recent hybridization between F and O-A gene pools (Supplementary Fig. S1D).3.2. Detection of genetic diversity, LD, and inbreeding/bottlenecksUsing the information from the 5,180 SNP set, we evaluated the possibility of inbreeding/bottleneck situations by comparing observed HO versus HE and using FIS values with a null hypothesis of random mating within each species. When considering the entire domesticated peach group (P. persica, n = 67), the HO value was found to be significantly lower than the He value (HO = 0.264, HE = 0.401, Supplementary Table S2), which suggests the occurrence of a population bottleneck or a recent shift to higher inbreeding during domestication. A similar situation was observed for the L clusters (HO = 0.220, HE = 0.375 for L-EA, HO = 0.173, HE = 0.345 for L-OT). These findings were also supported by FIS values, suggesting degrees of inbreeding (FIS = 0.33–0.52; Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, the F and O clusters demonstrated no such trends in HO/HE and FIS values (Supplementary Table S2). Pairwise characterization of IBD to infer pedigree relationships among 67 P. persica individuals, however, showed that all accessions in the F cluster had first- or second-degree relationships with cv. Chinese Cling (pi-hat > 0.25 for all individuals, average pi-hat = 0.44; Supplementary Fig. S2), supporting previous proposals regarding the establishment of modern cultivars32,33 and supporting the presence of strong genetic drift in the establishment of the F cluster. We detected significant IBD proportions between P. davidiana 2325-21A or P. mira 2228-21A and some individuals in the L cluster (pi-hat = ~0.189), despite the fact that P. mira and P. davidiana nested to the W cluster revealed no significant IBD values (pi-hat = 0). Moreover, the FO cluster demonstrated significant IBD values against the F and O-A clusters (pi-hat = ~0.419), although the F and O-A clusters have almost no pedigree relationships. These results support the possibility of recent hybridizations among these clusters.The degree of population structuring is related to LD extension/decay. In domesticated peach, LD in European and US cultivars has been reported to be longer (up to 13–15cM) than in other major perennial crops such as grape (<10 kb),18 based on an analysis of 50 microsatellite markers by Aranzana et al.33 However, the LD in landraces and the edible peaches primarily from China calculated using genome-wide SNPs was much shorter (up to 50 kb).30 The LD decay in domesticated peach cultivars, in which the average pairwise LD values showed no significant difference against the background, was extended to ~1,000–2,500 kb and would be even more delayed in the wild relatives (although the LD decay in the Wild cluster was unclear, presumably owing to a shortage of effective accession numbers and of polymorphisms in the W cluster when this SNPs chip was used) (Fig. 3A for chromosome 4, Supplementary Fig. S3 for other chromosomes and LD plots). This distance of LD decay in the domesticated peach population is consistent with that in US and European peach cultivars33 and greater than that in other major domesticated crops such as rice (up to 50–150 kb),9,60 sorghum (up to ca. 150 kb),42 and maize (up to 2 kb).61 In comparing clusters, the F cluster showed much greater delay in decay of LD than the two subclusters of the L cluster (L-EA and L-OT), ranging over 3,000 kb on some chromosomes (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S3). This finding supports a bottleneck or shift to higher inbreeding in the establishment of the F cluster from the progenitor landraces. The results of IBD test would support a recent bottleneck from cv. Chinese Cling (Supplementary Fig. S2). The O-A cluster, in general, showed no significant differences in LD decay from the two L subclusters (Fig. 3B), although a slightly significant increase in LD could be detected for the O-A cluster on a few chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S3). A significant delay in LD decay might also be expected from the distribution of EHH presented later. In the genome-wide LD analysis, we detected a clear monotonic decrease in static values of LD with the physical distance on any chromosome ranging from at least 1,000 kb in the domesticated peach cluster to even more in the F subcluster. This situation would make it preferable to identify selective sweeps based on LD index using small numbers of marker sets. In this study, we could use at least 5,000 pruned SNP sets (one SNP locus per ca. 45 kb on average in the peach genome) for subsequent analysis of selected genomic regions, yielding sufficient information for the identification of statistically distorted LD values from each SNP core in the genome. Comparison of LD decay in the wild species and each variety complex of domesticated peach. The average values of R2 in pairwise LD among the 1,346 SNPs on Chromosome 4, which carries the most SNPs among the eight chromosomes, in windows of up to 10,000 kb are shown.

Genome-wide detection of selection in domestication and cultivar differentiation pathwaysTo evaluate selective sweeps in local genomic regions, indexes based on the site frequency spectrum (SFS), such as p or Tajima's D which can detect fixed sweeps in a population, have been applied in plant species.8,12–14,30 In genome-wide analysis of selected regions, similar approaches including LD- or haploblock-based methods, which usually detect very recent and ongoing sweeps, are reported to be effective for some plant species9,10,62 and for some domesticated animals such as dog63 and chicken.39 Here, selections for domesticated peaches were expected to be recent or ongoing, particularly for the F cluster. Peach is a species with a long generation time (at least 2–3 yrs to flowering) and one for which individual genotypes can be maintained by vegetative propagation for long time periods, suggesting that selected genes may have been maintained in heterozygous states. Thus, we adopted indexes based not only on SFS but also on LD or haploblock for exploiting selective sweep, following genome-wide analyses of selection in human genomes.7,52–54In SFS-based analysis, we evaluated the transition of pooled heterozygosity (Hp) of each cluster using informative SNPs in a 400-kb sliding window with 100-kb steps, following a previous report on SFS-based analysis in chicken.39 The distributions of observed Hp values and Z-score values of Hp (ZHp), which considered coalescent effects by using the entire SNP sets in the peach genome, are shown in Fig. 4A for the domesticated peach population and two subpopulations, F and O-A. All showed some genomic regions containing candidates for selective sweeps with significant homozygous states in comparison to the whole genome (P < 0.001). However, the possibility that they are derived from differences in the substitution ratio in the peach genome, distortion of the availability in SNP patterns, or simple drift cannot be ruled out. Comparison of the Hp values between the F- or O-A clusters and the L cluster (Fig. 4B) revealed a significant bias in homozygous states among the clusters in specific genomic regions and suggested that at least some represent true selective sweeps that specifically occurred in the path to modern fruit or ornamental cultivar development. The middle of Chromosome 7 (ca. 8,000–8,800 kb) and the bottom of Chromosome 4 (ca. 29,200–29,600 kb) showed particularly clear tendencies to selective sweeps specific to the F and O-A subpopulations, respectively (Fig. 4C and D). Genome-wide selective sweep analysis based on ZHp, in the domesticated peach and two modern varietal complexes. (A) Transitions of Z-transformed values of Hp in 400-kb bins with 100-kb steps are shown for the domesticated peach population and two subpopulations, the F and O-A clusters.

(B) For the F and O-A clusters, plots of relative values of Hp in 400-kb bins with 100-kb steps against the L cluster are shown. Putative regions showing selective sweeps in the paths of differentiation from landraces are indicated by triangles. For the two regions indicated by black triangles, detailed characterization of ZHp in a comparison among four subpopulations (F, O-A, L-EA, and L-OT) is shown in (C) for the top of Chromosome 7, which corresponded to a putative selective sweep in the F cluster, and in (D) for the bottom of Chromosome 4, showing a putative selective sweep in the O-A cluster.Genome-wide selective sweep analysis based on ZHp, in the domesticated peach and two modern varietal complexes.

(B) For the F and O-A clusters, plots of relative values of Hp in 400-kb bins with 100-kb steps against the L cluster are shown.

For the two regions indicated by black triangles, detailed characterization of ZHp in a comparison among four subpopulations (F, O-A, L-EA, and L-OT) is shown in (C) for the top of Chromosome 7, which corresponded to a putative selective sweep in the F cluster, and in (D) for the bottom of Chromosome 4, showing a putative selective sweep in the O-A cluster.LD- or haploblock-based analyses were performed in accordance with the concept of EHH.52 The program Sweep53 was used to evaluate the iHS,54 which quantifies the difference of EHH values around the selected locus in one population, and the Cross-Population EHH (XP-EHH),53 which calculates EHH values from the same SNPs core between two populations using phased SNP strings. In both analyses, EHH values collected in 1,000-kb sections from each SNP locus showed significant reductions (ca. 0.05).The iHS in domesticated peach, as well as the two subpopulations F and O-A, showed specific patterns of significant peaks (P < 0.0001) corresponding to putative selective sweeps (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Figs S5 and S6A). The patterns of the peaks for the selective sweep in iHS were considerably different from those in the SFS-based analysis (Fig. 4), perhaps because the iHS detects mainly selected alleles in the heterozygous state, whereas the SFS-based analysis is applicable mainly to the detection of homozygosity. Still, the same positions for putative selection in SFS-based and iHS analyses were selected on Chromosome 7 (ca. 8,000–8,800 kb) in the F cluster (P < 0.00001 in iHS). The XP-EHH analyses were performed in comparisons between domesticated peach and the W clusters, and between the F or O-A and the L clusters (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6B) to analyse genes selected in the course of domestication and cultivar differentiation. In the XP-EHH analysis of domesticated peach and the W clusters, the peaks were at the bottoms of Chromosome 4 (ca. 25,000–27,000 kb for P < 0.001), and Chromosome 6 (ca. 25,000–26,500 kb for P < 0.001). In XP-EHH analyses, they were similar to those in iHS analyses of the domesticated peach (Fig. 5, P < 0.000001 for chr. 4, and P < 0.0001 for chr. 6). Some of the significant peaks in XP-EHH analyses were different from those in the iHS and SFS-based approaches. Similar situations have been reported in analyses using EHH- and SFS-based methods in human evolution, which captured certain selected regions in all approaches, further supporting the value of using multiple approaches for comprehensive analysis of positive selection.52,53 The XP-EHH analyses of the F or O-A cluster relative to the L cluster also showed some specific peaks, though different from the iHS and SFS-based results. Significant peaks could still be detected on Chromosome 4 (ca. 8,500–9,500 kb) and Chromosome 7 (ca. 8,000–8,800 kb) in the F cluster (P < 0.00001). The peak on Chromosome 4 was also detected in the domesticated peach cluster by the SFS-based method (Fig. 4). Genome-wide analysis for positive selection based on EHH.

Candidate genes under selectionFor the F and O-A clusters, genetic diversity of candidate genes located on representative regions under putative strong positive selection was estimated. These included Chromosome 7 (8,000–8,800 kb) for the F cluster, Chromosomes 4 (29,200–29,400 kb) and 8 (16,900–17,550 kb) for the O-A cluster, and Chromosome 1 for both (1,200–1,500 kb), using the 30 domesticated peach accessions (Supplementary Table S3). Note that the focus was only on genes annotated with functions possibly conferring advantages of differentiation. Of these, ppa004528m, ppa016246m, and ppa025156m showed significant reduction in genetic diversity in the F cluster (p = 0–0.00007) against the O-A and landrace (L-EA and L-OT) clusters (average p = 0.00114 ± 0.00021, 0.00279 ± 0.00011, and 0.00629 ± 0.00091, respectively, Supplementary Table S4). However, no disruptions or substitutions clearly associated with the functional changes in the ORF sequences could be identified, although minor substitutions on protein sequences were observed in comparison to some landraces. For the O-A cluster, ppa003808m showed a significant reduction in genetic diversity (p = 0) in comparison to the other clusters (average p = 0.00150 ± 0.00017, Supplementary Table S4). ppa003808m retained a trihelix motif, showing high similarity to the PETALLOSS (PTL) gene, which is involved in petal size and morphology in Arabidopsis thaliana.64–664.

Domestication path in peachThe domestication events for major annual crops, such as maize or rice, have been well characterized, owing in part to the relatively straightforward selection for consumable parts as well as the genetic fixation of key controlling genes in distinct species or cultivars. Tree crops appear to have more complicated domestication histories.18,22 For example, landrace accessions of P. persica, such as Kemomo Nagoshijou or Kutao, which show wild species-like characteristics, share a similar genetic structure with cultivated peach accessions. Thus, it may be difficult to define a single domestication path. Two scenarios are supported by the data: (i) current wild peach cultivars (feral peaches) were derived from divergent lines after a general domestication event or (ii) multiple independent domestications occurred for each trait or region. The first scenario (i) would fit well with the premise that P. persica was first domesticated from a wild species in China before diffusion to other regions.28,29 Such a general domestication event is supported by the tendencies for population bottlenecks or inbreeding to be detected using the full population of peach (P. persica) in this study. In contrast, other domesticated perennial crops such as grape and apple are reported to lack narrow domestication bottlenecks.18,22,67 However, in theory, perennial woody crops are under strong bottleneck pressures during domestication, resulting from the ease of their clonal propagation as well as difficulties associated with their long generation time. The wide domestication bottleneck in grape might be explained by widespread use of vegetative propagation of a large number of landraces with a resulting maintenance of genetic diversity as well as of many local genetic clusters.18 This situation would be more aligned with the second scenario (ii). The results of IBD analysis in peach showed that, except for the F cluster, most cultivars have no first- or second-degree relationships. This situation is distinct from that of domesticated grapevine, which shows a high ratio of first-degree relationships with a relatively small number of representative cultivars.18 This finding indicates that there were not many opportunities for domestication or construction of local clusters in peach, at least for the cultivars examined in this study.4.2. Selection in peach domestication and cultivar differentiationAncient selection in the peach genome appears likely, although some observations may be due to genetic drift. Results from QTL analysis have also been used to support selection during domestication and cultivar differentiation in rice8 and chicken39 In the present study, the strong putative selection on Chromosome 4 (ca 8,500–9,500 kb) detected in modern fruit cultivars (the F cluster) is consistent with a major QTL (UDP96-003) for important domestication traits, including fruit size and maturity date previously reported by Quilot et al. in a backcross between cultivated peach and its wild relative P. davidiana.68 This finding suggests that favourable allele(s) in this region had been selected from wild ancestors during domestication. Furthermore, evidence for selection is observed at the bottom of Chromosome 6 (ca. 25,000–26,500 kb) which corresponds to the genomic regions XP-EHH and iHS, known to contain the self-incompatibility (S) controlling haplotype, including an F-box gene as the pollen-S (SFB) factor and an RNase gene as the pistil-S (S-RNase) factor in Prunus species.69,70 Previously, it has been suggested that the whole domesticated peach (P. persica), including all clusters apart from the W cluster in this study, is a self-compatible (SC) species with at least four forms of pollen-S, PpSFB1–4, disruptive mutations.71,72 Meanwhile, to some extent, the wild species (W cluster) in the Amygdalus subgenus are supposed to demonstrate SI.73 In general, a shift from SI to SC is strongly selected during domestication to facilitate the stable production of inbred lines.27 In contrast, a change in the mating system from SI to SC could have a strong influence on the pattern of polymorphisms, affecting genetic diversity and LD. This might result in the differences in genetic structures between wild species and domesticated peach.At least three candidates for selection were identified in the F cluster, with many on Chromosome 7. The candidates, ppa004528m, ppa016246m, and ppa025156m, show high similarity to lycopene cyclase-like At3g10230 (LYC)/At5g57030 (LUT2), At3g18030 (Arabidopsis thaliana Hal3-like protein A; AtHAL3A), and At1g18990 (reduced vernalization response 1; VRN1) in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Lycopene cyclases (LYCs) play a role in the biosynthesis of lutein, which is a member of the carotenoid pathway.74 The simplest explanation for the selection of ppa004528m may be its association with the yellow carotenoid pigmentation in peach. However, the flesh coloration of peach is determined mainly by the Y locus, which is reportedly located on Chromosome 1 (LG1).75,76 Major QTLs for skin color are also different from those in most regions identified as having experienced selective sweeps, although one of them is located on Chromosome 7.77 The other two candidates, AtHal3A-like and VRN1-like genes, may contribute salt/osmotic tolerance and flowering/bud-burst timing, respectively, based on the functions of their homologs in Arabidopsis.78,79 In considering the uses and characteristics of modern fruit cultivars, we may expect that some genes directly involved in fruit traits, such as fruit size, sugar contents, or the important flesh-softening trait often called ‘melting texture’, have been under strong selection. Where selection for more ornamental traits is expected, as in the O-A cluster, ppa003808m appears to be a good candidate, given that the associated PETALLOSS trait is known to affect morphological or architectural changes, particularly for flowers.Genes with annotation for fruit quality and ornamental value are limited at present, presumably because of the lack of information for these traits in model plant species. Thus, the still-uncharacterized genes located in the selected regions in the F and O-A clusters may provide opportunities for elucidating critical tree domestication factors not present in current annual plant models. Genes controlling such key domestication and cultivar differentiation factors could be identified by improved characterization of the selection pathways involved, perhaps by further exploiting the wide genetic diversity present in peach and similar perennial tree crops. This research approach could prove powerful, particularly for long-lived perennial crops where mutagenetic and map-based approaches are restricted.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Research Activity Start-up from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (number 23880013 to T.A.).

IntroductionCotton (Gossypium) is an important cash crop and the uppermost source of textile fibre, and G. hirsutum and G. barbadense account for 90 and 8% of the world cotton production, respectively.1 Thus, genome structure analysis of allotetraploid cotton is important, but the allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 52) species has a large genome size of ~2,246 Mb,2 indicating that it is especially difficult to generate a reference genome sequence. As a result, a high-density genetic linkage map is an optional tool to reveal genome structure and chromosomal architecture of allotetraploid cotton.Currently, there are four comparatively dense linkage maps in cotton based on experimental data. Rong et al.3 (2,584 loci, 4447.9 cM in length with an average distance of 1.72 cM) revealed all 13 expected homologous chromosome pairs and reported that there were no major structural changes between DT and D chromosomes, but two reciprocal translocations between AT and A chromosomes and several inversions. Guo et al.4 (2,247 loci, 3440.4 cM in length with an average distance of 1.58 cM) again reported the translocations that occurred between some chromosomes (Chr02 and Chr03, Chr04 and Chr05), providing a glimpse of cotton genome complexity. Based on a genome-wide simple sequence repeat (SSR) genetic map (2,316 loci, 4418.9 cM in length with an average distance of 1.91 cM) constructed in our laboratory,5 21 segregation distortion regions (SDRs) were found, and 3 segregation distorted chromosomes (Chr02, Chr16, and Chr18) were identified with 99.9% of distorted markers segregating towards the heterozygous allele. A genetic linkage map (2,072 loci, 3379.9 cM in length with an average distance of 1.63 cM) constructed by Yu et al.6 showed that the allotetraploid cotton genome produced equivalent recombination frequencies in its two genomes and revealed that the genetically smallest homologous chromosome pair was Chr04 and Chr22, and the largest was Chr05 and Chr19. Just prior to this publication, a sequence-based interspecific genetic map composed of 4,999,048 SNP loci was reported, which contains only 4,049 recombination bins and covers 4,042 cM with an average interbin genetic distance of 1.0 cM.7 First, this map played a role in genomic assembly of allotetraploid cotton. Second, some structural variations not only in the AT genome but also in the DT genome were detected, including 15 first reported simple translocations. Third, centromeric regions of tetraploid cotton were predicted. All of the above genetic maps played fundamental roles in understanding the cotton genome structure and in studying cotton evolutionary genomics.With the release of G. raimondii genome sequence, genetic relationship analysis showed that G. raimondii and Theobroma cacao belong to a common subclade.8 In addition, the two genomes possess a moderate syntenic relationship, with 463 collinear blocks (with =5 genes per block) covering 64.8 and 74.41% of the assembled G. raimondii and T. cacao genomes, respectively.8 Subsequently, G. arboreum genome sequence was released,9 and a close collinear relationship between G. arboreum and T. cacao was also discovered. Besides, collinearity analysis between G. raimondii and G. arboreum revealed that chromosomes 1, 4–6, and 9–13 were highly collinear, whereas large-scale rearrangements were observed on chromosomes 2 and 3 of G. raimondii, and deletions/insertions were observed on chromosomes 7 and 8 of G. arboreum. In 2015, G. hirsutum genome sequence was released,10 which showed a conserved order between the ATDT genome and the already sequenced diploid genomes.8,9 However, another version of the ATDT genome (G. hirsutum)11 showed that such collinearity was not obvious with either G. arboreum9 or G. raimondii.8 Instead, it is largely conserved with another version of the D-progenitor genome (G. raimondii).12 In addition, the overall gene order and collinearity are largely conserved between the AT and DT genomes although at least 9 translocations and 28 inversions were identified.In the present study, a high-density genetic linkage map including 5,152 loci for tetraploid cotton was constructed mainly based on SSR markers. With this map, we aimed to reveal the cotton genome structure by homologous chromosome comparisons and to explain the polyploidization of tetraploid cotton by comparing this map with two sequenced progenitor diploid cottons.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsGossypium hirsutum cv. Emian22 and G. barbadense acc. 3–79 were used to detect polymorphisms of all the new markers. Emian22 is a high yield cultivar with moderate fibre quality and no resistance to verticillium wilt, whereas 3–79 is the genetic and cytogenetic standard line for G. barbadense with super fibre quality and high resistance to verticillium wilt. To improve the performance of Emian22 by backcrossing and molecular-assisted selection, a cross between these two materials was performed. Subsequently, the BC1 population [(Emian22 × 3–79) × Emian22] including 141 progeny was used as the mapping population, which had been used to construct a 2,316 loci map.52.2. Molecular markersDuring map construction in this study, 5,299 new primer pairs were applied, including 4,569 newly published SSRs (2,937 MON-prefixed, 664 NBRI-prefixed, 670 CCRI-prefixed, 200 HAU-prefixed, and 98 NAU-prefixed; http://www.cottongen.org/) and 730 other batches of primers (579 GhirPIP-prefixed,13 115 cg-prefixed,14 and 36 cot-prefixed14).2.3. Genotyping analysisPolymorphism detection of all the new SSRs was performed as previously described.15 For the remnant monomorphic SSRs, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was applied, which is identical to the method described by Li et al.16 For the other three batches of primers (GhirPIP-prefixed, cg-prefixed, and cot-prefixed), SSCP analysis is the only method for genotyping analysis. Subsequently, genotyping of the whole population using polymorphic primers was carried out on the corresponding condition. All DNA fragments were detected with silver staining.2.4. Map constructionThe mapping data for each BC1 individual were scored according to the definition of JoinMap 3.0.17 For each segregating marker, a <U+03C7>2 analysis was performed to determine whether it is deviated from the expected 1 : 1 segregation ratio. During map construction, the logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold was =8.0, and the maximum recombination rate was 0.4. Map distances in centiMorgans (cM) were calculated using the Kosambi mapping function.18 In the resulting linkage map, a region with at least three adjacent loci showing significant segregation distortion (P < 0.05) was defined as the SDR.192.5. Collinearity and comparative genomic analysisBased on the high-density genetic linkage map and sequences corresponding to markers, collinearity analysis between homologous chromosome pairs was performed using a BLASTN search with E = 1e-5, identity =80%, and matched length =200 bp. Next, the best hit for each marker was chosen, and all the best hits were illustrated intuitively using online drawing tools (http://circos.ca/). Comparative genomic analysis between tetraploid cotton and diploid cottons was performed using a similar method.3. Results3.1. Marker informationTo construct a high-density genetic linkage map to meet the demands of cotton genetics and breeding, 200 novel EST-SSRs (HAU3599-HAU3798) were developed in this study. In detail, 3,647 unique sequences were obtained from a normalized adversity cDNA library of G. barbadense acc. Hai7124, and then they were searched against the cotton EST database (posted date: 22 March 2009, with a total of 375,349 sequences), with an E-value cut-off of <1e-10. As a result, 255 had no BLAST hits to known sequences. Subsequently, a total of 200 novel EST-SSRs were developed. During map construction, traditional genotyping analysis made 26 (13.00%) polymorphic primer pairs generating 26 polymorphic loci, and SSCP analysis made 14 (8.05%) polymorphic primer pairs generating 16 polymorphic loci from the remnant monomorphic markers. In total, 40 (20.00%) HAU-prefixed EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 42 polymorphic loci, with an average of 1.05 alleles.Among the 670 CCRI-prefixed and 98 NAU-prefixed EST-SSRs, traditional genotyping analysis made 75 (11.19%) and 66 (67.35%) polymorphic EST-SSRs generating 78 and 79 polymorphic loci, respectively. For the remnant monomorphic markers, SSCP analysis was applied. As a result, 67 (11.26%) and 11 (34.38%) were polymorphic with 73 and 11 polymorphic loci, respectively. In total, 142 (21.19%) CCRI-prefixed and 77 (78.57%) NAU-prefixed EST-SSRs were polymorphic, and generated 151 and 90 polymorphic loci, with an average of 1.06 and 1.17 alleles, respectively.The total 2,937 MON-prefixed SSRs consist of 2,521 gSSRs and 416 EST-SSRs. After traditional genotyping analysis, 879 (34.87%) gSSRs and 129 (31.01%) EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 1,005 and 140 polymorphic loci, respectively. Then, the SSCP analysis was conducted with the remnant monomorphic markers. Subsequently, 126 (7.67%) gSSRs and 12 (4.18%) EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 138 and 13 polymorphic loci, respectively. In total, 1,005 (39.87%) MON-prefixed gSSRs and 141 (33.89%) MON-prefixed EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 1,143 and 153 polymorphic loci, with an average of 1.14 and 1.09 alleles, respectively. Taking the 2,937 MON-prefixed SSRs as a whole, 1,146 (39.02%) primers were polymorphic, and generated 1,296 polymorphic loci, with an average of 1.13 alleles.The total 664 NBRI-prefixed SSRs consist of 263 gSSRs and 401 EST-SSRs. After traditional genotyping analysis, 85 (32.32%) gSSRs and 122 (30.42%) EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 97 and 136 polymorphic loci, respectively. Then, SSCP analysis was performed with the remnant monomorphic markers. Subsequently, 11 (6.18%) gSSRs and 15 (5.38%) EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 11 and 17 polymorphic loci, respectively. In total, 96 (36.50%) NBRI-prefixed gSSRs and 137 (34.16%) NBRI-prefixed EST-SSRs showed polymorphism, and generated 108 and 153 polymorphic loci, with an average of 1.13 and 1.12 alleles, respectively. Taking the 664 NBRI-prefixed SSRs as a whole, 233 (35.09%) primers showed polymorphism, and generated 261 polymorphic loci, with an average of 1.12 alleles.For the 579 GhirPIP-prefixed, 115 cg-prefixed, and 36 cot-prefixed primer pairs, SSCP analysis was directly applied. As a result, 27 (4.66%) GhirPIP-prefixed, 13 (11.30%) cg-prefixed, and 5 (13.89%) cot-prefixed primer pairs showed polymorphism, and each polymorphic primer pair produced one polymorphic locus.3.2. Map construction and overviewThe 1,885 loci obtained in this study were added to the 3,747 loci updated in our laboratory,5,16,20–27 and a total of 5,632 loci were used for map construction. After calculation, a linkage map with 5,152 loci was constructed, and it was 4696.03 cM in total length and 0.91 cM in mean distance (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table 1). The chromosomes were built with LODs ranging from 8.0 to 15.0 (Table 1). The AT genome contained 2,473 loci with 2359.36 cM in total length and 0.95 cM in mean distance, whereas the DT genome contained 2,679 loci with 2336.67 cM in total length and 0.87 cM in mean distance. Characteristics of the linkage map constructed from the BC1 populationLOD, logarithm of odds.Characteristics of the linkage map constructed from the BC1 populationLOD, logarithm of odds.The chromosome with the most loci was Chr19 (306 loci), whereas Chr04 had the fewest loci (122 loci), with average loci on each chromosome of 198. The longest chromosome was Chr21 (256.03 cM), whereas the shortest was Chr16 (94.32 cM), with an average chromosome length of 180.62 cM. The largest average distance between markers was on Chr01 (1.31 cM), and the least was on Chr16 (0.53 cM). The largest gap between markers was 22.56 cM on Chr17, and there were a total of 15 gaps >10 cM with 4 on the AT and 11 on the DT genome.Among the 5,632 polymorphic loci used for map construction, 1,006 loci (17.86%) showed segregation distortion (P < 0.05) and 776 distorted loci, accounting for 15.06% of the mapped loci, were unevenly mapped on cotton chromosomes with 5–125 loci on each chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S1). The most distorted loci were on Chr02 (71), Chr16 (125), and Chr18 (106) (>50% of loci were distorted), accounting for 38.92% of the mapped distorted loci. A total of 62 SDRs were found on 18 cotton chromosomes. More SDRs were found on Chr02 (9), Chr16 (11), and Chr18 (10), which were the chromosomes with the most distorted loci.3.3. Collinearity in the cotton genomeBased on the 4,807 available marker-derived sequences in the genetic linkage map, homology analysis showed that homologous chromosomes between AT and DT had the highest homology (Fig. 1). In detail, seven homologous chromosome pairs (Chr01 and Chr15, Chr06 and Chr25, Chr08 and Chr24, Chr09 and Chr23, Chr11 and Chr21, Chr12 and Chr26, and Chr13 and Chr18) showed high collinearity. However, not the whole chromosomes showed collinearity between Chr10 and Chr20 (Supplementary Fig. S2A), whereas Chr07 and Chr16 had good homology but hardly any collinearity (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In addition, although most of Chr02 had good collinearity with Chr14, the rest had comparatively good collinearity with Chr17 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Additionally, most of Chr03 had good collinearity with Chr17, but the rest had comparatively good collinearity with Chr14 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Moreover, this also appeared among Chr04, Chr05, Chr19, and Chr22 (Supplementary Fig. S3C and D). Collinearity among 26 chromosomes in tetraploid cotton.

Comparative genomics between the tetraploid cotton and diploid cottonsUsing the 4,807 available nucleotide sequences of 5,152 mapped markers and the genome sequence of G. arboreum or G. raimondii, we found by comparative genomics that sequences of 3,534 and 3,584 markers were homologous from the physical map of G. arboreum and G. raimondii, with an alignment proportion of 68.59 and 69.57%, respectively. The 3,534 markers blasted on the G. arboreum genome included 1,717 markers from the AT genome with an alignment proportion of 69.43%, and 1,817 markers from the DT genome with an alignment proportion of 67.82%. The 3,584 markers blasted on the G. raimondii genome included 1,631 markers from the AT genome with an alignment proportion of 65.95% and 1,953 markers from the DT genome with an alignment proportion of 72.90%.In general, most chromosomes had good homology with their corresponding chromosomes in the diploid A or D genome (Figs 2 and 3, and Table 2). Exceptionally, during comparative analysis with the diploid A genome, three homologous chromosome pairs, Chr01/Chr15, Chr02/Chr14, and Chr03/Chr17, also showed good homology with A2, A5, and A7, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 2). During comparative analysis with the diploid D genome, Chr02, Chr03, Chr04, and Chr05 also showed good homology with D3, D5, D9, and D12, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 2).

Blast analysis between the tetraploid cotton and the mixed genome of two diploid cottonsA blast analysis of markers on the tetraploid cotton genetic linkage map was conducted by taking the G. arboreum and G. raimondii genomes together. Regardless of whether it is from the AT or DT genome, all homologous chromosome pairs, except for Chr01/Chr15, Chr02/Chr14, Chr03/Chr17, and Chr05/Chr19, had the highest homology with the corresponding homologous chromosome in the diploid A genome, and had the second highest homology with the corresponding homologous chromosome in the diploid D genome (Fig. 4 and Table 3). Chr01 was predominantly homologous to A7, followed by A2 and D2; Chr15 had the highest homology with D2, followed by A2 and A7. Chr02 had the highest homology with A5, followed by A2, but very low homology with D5; Chr14 had the highest homology with A5, followed by D5, but very low homology with A2. Chr03 had the highest homology with A5, followed by A7, and low homology with D3; Chr17 had the highest homology with D3, followed by A7, and no homology with A5. Chr04 had the highest homology with A12, followed by D12 and D9; Chr22 had the highest homology with A12, followed by D12. Chr05 had the highest homology with A10, followed by D9 and A12; Chr19 had the highest homology with D9, followed by A10 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S4, and Table 3).

Different polymorphism ratios of markersHigh-density genetic linkage maps are becoming increasingly important. Because the polymorphism in cotton is low,28,29 more researchers have paid attention to developing novel markers. Our laboratory also endeavoured to develop more molecular markers to construct high-density linkage maps in cotton to facilitate our cotton genetics and breeding studies. In this study, 200 HAU-prefixed new SSRs were developed from newly released ESTs from an adversity cDNA library of G. barbadense acc. Hai7124, which supplement our previously published markers.Among all the SSR markers applied in this study, NAU-prefixed EST-SSRs showed the highest polymorphism ratio (78.57%), mainly owing to the artificial selection of polymorphic SSRs based on published results.30 Polymorphisms of HAU (20.00%), CCRI (21.19%), MON (33.89%), and NBRI (34.16%)-prefixed EST-SSRs were universally lower than that of MON (39.87%) and NBRI (36.50%)-prefixed gSSRs, which is in accordance with previous reports that ESTs are more conservative because of more selective pressure.16,31 Polymorphisms of MON- and NBRI-prefixed EST-SSRs were much higher than that of HAU- and CCRI-prefixed EST-SSRs for the following reasons. MON-prefixed SSRs reliably generated two or more amplicons,32 which raised the possibility of producing polymorphisms in each primer pair. NBRI-prefixed SSRs were developed from G. herbaceum (AA);33 when they were used in tetraploid cottons (AADD), high polymorphism between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense may be detected. Generally speaking, the SSR markers in this study were comparatively highly polymorphic. One cause may be the great difference between the two parents, and the other would be the application of the SSCP method during genotyping analysis.GhirPIP-prefixed markers13 (containing intron single-nucleotide polymorphisms and intron length polymorphisms with a predicted ratio of 3 : 1), cg-prefixed SNP/InDel markers14 (developed from 3' end, 5' end, or intron sequences), and cot-prefixed SNP/InDel markers14 (developed from conserved orthologous sets) all showed low polymorphism (4.66, 11.30, and 13.89%, respectively), mainly because the SSCP method applied in this study has its recognized limits in reflecting SNPs/InDels. The reason why GhirPIP-prefixed markers showed such a low polymorphism rate (4.66%) may be that they were developed from the predicted introns of G. hirsutum based on the complete genome sequence of model plants, which existed deviation undoubtedly.Thus, together with previous reports that SSR markers are highly reproducible across species,34 and could provide more convenient assays of collinearity between different genomes,35 SSRs are ideal markers for map construction.4.2. Characteristics of genome structure in tetraploid cottonAs previously reported, a high-density genetic linkage map could accelerate genome structure analysis. The present map (5,152 loci, 4696.03 cM in length with an average distance of 0.91 cM; Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table 1) revealed that (i) more loci were found on the DT genome than on the AT genome, consistent with the results of Guo et al.4 and Yu et al.,5 but inconsistent with those of Rong et al.3 and Yu et al.;6 (ii) the DT genome was shorter than the AT genome, consistent with the results of Rong et al.,3 Yu et al.,5 and Yu et al.,6 but inconsistent with those of Guo et al.;4 (iii) the average marker distance of the DT genome is shorter than that of the AT genome, consistent with the results of Rong et al.,3 Guo et al.,4 and Yu et al.,5 but inconsistent with those of Yu et al.;6 and (iv) there were more gaps (>10 cM) on the DT genome than on the AT genome, consistent with the results of Yu et al.,5 but inconsistent with those of Rong et al.,3 Guo et al.,4 and Yu et al.6 Variations among the five genetic linkage maps are likely the results of differences in the mapping population types and sizes, as well as in the numbers and sources of molecular markers.In this study, 776 of the total 1,006 distorted loci were mapped on the 26 cotton chromosomes, and 62 SDRs were discovered. Further analysis showed that three chromosomes (Chr02, Chr16, and Chr18) had extreme segregation distortion (>50% of loci showing distortion, accounting for 38.92% of the mapped distorted loci, and containing 30 SDRs), which has been identified by our previous study.5 Because segregation distortion is increasingly recognized as a potentially powerful evolutionary force,36 the present results suggest the prospect for a wider application. In addition, segregation distortion mechanisms of these three chromosomes are being researched using eight reciprocal backcrossing populations, which were financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31171593).Tetraploid cotton, containing AT and DT genomes, was formed from an interspecific hybridization event between diploid A and diploid D cotton species that may have evolved from a common ancestor.37,38 As a result, 13 expected homologous AT/DT chromosome pairs were further confirmed by the present results that the highest homology or collinearity existed between them (Fig. 1), which is in accordance with previous reports.3 These results may be useful in identifying candidate genes. For example, if one quantitative trait locus (QTL) was detected on the AT chromosome, a candidate gene controlling the same trait could be predicted on the corresponding collinear segment of the DT chromosome, so that we can study the functional divergence of homologous genes. However, it is notable that an obvious inversion appeared on Chr10 or Chr20, and repeated inversions appeared on Chr07 or Chr16 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, two reciprocal translocations between Chr02 and Chr03 and between Chr04 and Chr05 were confirmed in this study (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3), corresponding to previous reports.3,6,28,39 All of the above may result from genome rearrangements during or after the polyploidization process of the two ancestral diploid genomes, indicating complex but linear features of the tetraploid cotton genome.6 Another possibility is that the conformation of Chr02, Chr03, Chr04, and Chr05 in the AT genome may result from fracture and fusion of ancient chromosomes, since diploid cotton is a paleohexaploid with a radix of seven.124.3. Good collinearity between the AT/DT genome in tetraploid and diploid A/D genomesComparative genomic analysis between tetraploid cotton and diploid cottons showed that 12 chromosomes in the AT genome, except for Chr02 (AT2), showed good collinearity with chromosomes in the diploid A genome (Fig. 2 and Table 2); and 13 chromosomes in the DT genome showed good collinearity with chromosomes in the diploid D genome (Fig. 3 and Table 2), which is consistent with the results of Li et al.9 and Wang et al.,8 respectively, and is consistent with the report that no major structural changes exist between the DT and D chromosomes, but rather between the AT and A chromosomes.3,40 Moreover, homology between the AT genome and the diploid D genome (Fig. 3 and Table 2), as well as between the DT genome and the diploid A genome (Fig. 2 and Table 2), supplied further evidence to define 13 homologous chromosome pairs in tetraploid cotton. In addition, it also provided evidence for collinearity between the diploid A and D genomes, as well as homology between chromosomes from different diploid genomes. The present results are a complete unification of the reports that are entirely based on the genome sequences of two diploid species.94.4. The diploid A genome dominates the tetraploid cotton genomeIt is well known that tetraploid cotton was formed from an interspecific hybridization event between an A-genome species and a D-genome species,4 and the diploid A genome is nearly 2-fold larger than the D genome, although they diverged from a common ancestor ~5–10 million years ago.38 However, previous studies,3–6 as well as the present study, reported that there is a minor difference between the AT and DT genomes in tetraploid cotton. Previous reports that the AT genome is more stable than the DT genome,28 and the present fact that regardless of an AT or DT genome origin, most chromosomes had the highest homology with the corresponding homologous chromosomes in the diploid A genome (Fig. 4 and Table 3), support the inference that during the hybridization evolution of tetraploid cotton, the DT genome underwent invasion of the diploid A genome (Fig. 5). This result may partly explain why the diploid D-genome species do not produce spinnable fibre,41 while many QTLs for fibre-related traits have been detected in the DT genome of tetraploid cotton.42–44Schematic drawing that illustrates the evolution of most chromosomes. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Schematic drawing that illustrates the evolution of most chromosomes. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.If the formation of Chr04/Chr22 and Chr05/Chr19 was similar to other homologous chromosome pairs, their structure should be as shown in Fig. 6A. However, blast analysis between the tetraploid cotton genome and the mixed genome of two diploid cottons showed that Chr04 had the highest homology with A12, followed by D12 and D9 that were equal to each other. Additionally, Chr05 had the highest homology with A10, followed by D9 and A12 that were equal to each other (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, it is predicted that Chr04 should have a segment of D9, and Chr05 should have a segment of A12 (as shown in Fig. 6C). This prediction could also be confirmed by comparative genomics between the tetraploid cotton and diploid cottons (Figs 2 and 3, and Table 2). In that way, chromosomal translocations must occur during interspecific hybridization events as shown in Fig. 6B. In detail, one chromosome translocation occurred between Chr04 and Chr05, and another one occurred between Chr04 and Chr19. Similarly, considering the results of comparative genomics between the tetraploid cotton and diploid cottons, and the results of blast analysis between the tetraploid cotton genome and the mixed genome of two diploid cottons, a series of chromosomal translocations among Chr01/Chr15, Chr02/Chr14, and Chr03/Chr17 could also be predicted (Fig. 7). All of the above demonstrate that these five homologous chromosome pairs changed in a complex and dramatic manner in that they coevolved during polyploidization, while other chromosomes in the AT genome just happened minor variations and those in the DT genome just underwent invasion of the corresponding homologous chromosome in the diploid A genome.

Applications of the high-density linkage map in tetraploid cotton genomics, genetics, and breedingThe present high-density genetic linkage map, with an average interval of 0.91 × 400 kb between genetic markers on the basis of a consensus estimate of genome size of ~2,246Mb, provides a foundation to facilitate genome sequencing and sequence assembly.45 Besides, it well revealed the genome structure of tetraploid cotton and provided preliminary hypotheses of tetraploid cotton formation from two diploid cotton species. Until now, cotton breeders have been working to transfer excellent genes controlling fibre quality from G. barbadense to G. hirsutum. And, introgression lines have proved to be an optional way to solve high sterility and crazed segregation of interspecific hybrid progeny. Excellent introgression lines are usually constructed by marker-assisted selection, which is inevitably linked to a genetic linkage map. The present high-density linkage map could also provide markers that are tightly linked with target traits, which is undoubtedly very useful to molecular breeding and genetic improvement.FundingThis work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (grant no. 31171593) and Genetically Modified Organisms Breeding Major Project of China (no. 2014ZX08009).

Ancient DNA as an indispensable source of information The passion for unravelling and reconstructing the history of life on Earth has always stimulated research in evolutionary biology. Although inferences of past events such as the states of ancestral organisms (e.g. ancestral sequences), evolutionary episodes (e.g. speciation), and the dynamics governing change (e.g. mutation models) can be obtained through computational phylogenetic and coalescent approaches using contemporary data, naturalists have always valued direct observation above all other methods. Ancient DNA (aDNA) is thus expected to revolutionize evolutionary genetics in the same manner that systematic approach to the analysis of fossil records revolutionized palaeontology: it is a direct window into the past — a ‘time capsule’. aDNA has already been invaluable in addressing many key questions in evolutionary biology, 1–14 frequently providing the only available evidence.  Studies over the past several decades have demonstrated that aDNA can survive and be extracted from ancient and historical material (e.g. bones, teeth, eggshells; mummified, frozen, or artificially preserved tissues). The first attempts to extract and analyse aDNA were performed before the PCR era. In a pioneer study in 1984, Higuchi et al. 15 managed to recover DNA using bacterial cloning from dried muscle of quagga, an extinct subspecies of plains zebra ( Equus quagga ). However, due to extremely poor DNA preservation, analyses of aDNA were limited until an effective technology for DNA amplification, like PCR, made very small amounts of DNA accessible for study. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and the plummeting cost of DNA sequencing have provided an unprecedented opportunity to perform millions of sequencing reactions in parallel. These advances enabled the first report on ancient sequences retrieved by NGS in 2004. 16 Major milestones of development of high-resolution ancient human genomics 1,2,5,11,12,15,17–29 are shown in Fig. 1 . Major milestones of development of high-resolution ancient human genomics.Major milestones of development of high-resolution ancient human genomics.1.1. Human evolution and demographic history Over the past decade, genomic techniques have been reshaping our fundamental understanding of human prehistory and origins. 30,31 Until recently, much of what was known about prehistory came from the study of archaeological sites and anthropological investigations, piecing together patterns of human migration and admixture from physical features, pottery, weapons, ornaments, art production, traditional customs, and studies of modern DNA. 32 Other sources of information included linguistic classifications and ancient texts. Although undeniably powerful, these approaches often yielded more questions than answers, and their resolution required incorporation of additional data. Analysis of ancient human remains can reveal migration patterns, 4,10–13 address questions of kinship and family structure, 33 and provide insight into physiological or morphological characteristics such as blood group, skin colour, hair type, 34–37 and climatic adaptation. 2 When combined with other evidence, sequencing ancient genomes could help settle important debates within archaeology or linguistics. This approach, although not infallible, is particularly valuable now when ancient genetics is considered to be a highly robust tool and has significantly impacted many fields such as forensics and history. 38 Sequencing of the genomes from archaic hominids have illuminated earlier events in human evolution and suggested that early hominids had a richer evolutionary history than was previously appreciated. Analysis of Neanderthal genomes extracted from the remains found in Europe and Western and Central Asia and dated 230–30 thousand years ago (kya) demonstrated that contrary to previous suggestions, Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans (AMH) may have interbred. 1,8,39–46 The studies showed that Neanderthals share more genetic material with modern humans across Eurasia than those from sub-Saharan Africa, indicating that genetic flow from Neanderthals to Eurasian AMH likely occurred after the emergence of humans from Africa but before the divergence of Eurasian groups. 1,8 Additional gene flow events may have occurred later in Europe 44 and East Asia. 41,47 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of morphologically ambiguous Neanderthal bones from Teshik-Tash cave in Uzbekistan and Okladnikov cave in Southern Siberia provided evidence that Neanderthals had an extensive range prior to their extinction. 48 Since the first description of the Neanderthal genome, a number of studies have suggested that various Neanderthal alleles have been preferentially retained in modern populations due to specific selective pressures. 49 Remarkably, the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry in Eurasians decreased substantially since the Palaeolithic, from 4–6% to 1–2% today, suggesting that negative selection against Neanderthal alleles is at work. 28 Genetic analysis of mtDNA from a phalanx dated 48–30 kya recovered from the Denisova cave in Southern Siberia revealed another hominid, named Denisovan, which is genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. 50 Since then, only two more samples (molars) of Denisovans have been discovered 3 and recently sequenced. 51 Comparison of Neanderthal 1,8 and Denisovan 3,51 genomes suggested that for a long time their population histories were independent of each other. The Denisovan mtDNA represents a deep branch, with the Neanderthal mtDNA closer to that of modern humans 3 . Comparative analysis of the Denisovan and modern human genomes revealed that the genetic contribution from Denisovans to modern humans may have been restricted to Melanesia and Australia with hybridization events taking place mostly in the Southeast Asian mainland, although they may have permeated to Oceania 3,4,50,52,53 as recently suggested by the existence of a widespread, low-level signal of Denisovan ancestry across South and East Asian and Native American populations. 54 However, the exact scenario is hard to identify. 55,56 NGS analysis of a nearly complete mitochondrial genome of a hominid found in Sima de los Huesos cave in Atapuerca, Spain and dated to >300 kya 57 suggested the existence of another branch in the human evolutionary tree. Surprisingly, the Sima de los Huesos mtDNA forms a clade with the mitochondrial genome of Denisovans rather than that of Neanderthals, demonstrating an unexpected link between Denisovans and Middle Pleistocene European hominids. Recently, approximately three million bases of nuclear sequences were obtained from a Sima de los Huesos femur fragment, an incisor, and a molar. 27 In contrast to the mtDNA, the nuclear genomic sequences of Sima de los Huesos are significantly more similar to Neanderthals than to Denisovans. 27 These results agree with previous morphological analyses 58,59 but present an archaeological puzzle.  Studies of aDNA have also delineated human migration routes around the world, particularly in Europe. Analysis of human genomes from Europe and Siberia dated 24–5 kya 7,10,14,34,35 revealed at least three different sources of the population diversity of modern Europeans, i.e. West European hunter-gatherers, ancient North Eurasians with high similarity to Upper Palaeolithic Siberians, and early European farmers originating in the Near East. 7,60 Further aDNA studies allowed mapping migration in Europe in greater detail. A recent study of 69 European individuals who lived 8–3 kya 12 demonstrated that between 8 and 5 kya populations of Western and Eastern Europe were genetically distinct. Groups of early farmers of Near Eastern origin 60 arrived in Western Europe and mixed with local hunter-gatherers, whereas Eastern Europe at that time was inhabited by a distant branch of ancient North Eurasian hunter-gatherers. 10 However, Eastern Europe did not remain a ‘hunter-gatherer’s refuge’ for too long. Around 6–5 kya, farming populations of West Anatolian ancestry appeared in Eastern Europe and mixed with local hunter-gatherers in the Pontic-Caspian region, giving rise to pastoralist people of the extremely successful Yamnaya archaeological culture. Such multiethnic melting pots were fertile ground for many innovations, such as horse domestication and wheeled vehicles from the Yamnaya culture, 61 which probably enabled massive migration or invasions into Western and Northern Europe ~4.5 kya, introducing their ancestry, languages, and customs. Haak et al. 12 reported that this steppe ancestry persisted in central Europeans from at least 3 kya, and it is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. At approximately the same time, similar migrations spread Yamnaya-related cultures into South Siberia and Central Asia, as revealed by another large-scale study of 101 genomes from Eurasian Bronze Age (5–3 kya) burial sites. 11 Such large-scale aDNA studies 11,12,60 have not only made technical breakthroughs but also had significant interdisciplinary effects: they influenced the decades-long debate in archaeology and linguistics about the origin of Indo-European language speakers and shed light on perennial questions about the prevalence of traits like skin colour and lactose intolerance in modern Europeans.  With the progress in aDNA sequencing technology, notable studies of remains from all over the world have begun to emerge, 62–64 shedding light onto, e.g. settlement of China and the Pacific islands. Recently, Liu et al. 65 reported the discovery of an 80,000-yr-old man (the earliest modern human in southern China) raising questions about canonical paradigms of human dissemination, since there is no evidence that humans entered Europe before 45 kya. Sequencing of this individual would provide additional insights into the dispersal of humans in Eurasia. A recent study of a 4,500-yr-old Ethiopian skeleton preserved in relatively cool mountainous conditions was the first example of successful aDNA analysis in Africa, 26 giving hope to forthcoming studies of this incredibly interesting region.  Pending future advances in functional genomics, aDNA might prove an unrivalled source of information on the evolution of traits associated with cognitive phenotypes. For example, discovering the genetic variants responsible for language acquisition may allow researchers to pinpoint the origin of complex language in the human lineage, indubitably a cornerstone event in human evolution. Approximately a decade ago the Neanderthals were found to bear a modern human version of FOXP222 gene (likely responsible for the ability to speak 66 ). The authors suggested that the modern variant of FOXP2 was present in the common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. 22 We can also expect aDNA genomic studies to provide direct evidence about human adaptation substantiating the genetic basis of selection. For example, a genome-wide scan of 230 West Eurasians who lived 6.5–1 kya and their comparison with modern human genomes identified significant signatures of selection in a range of loci related to diet (lactase persistence, fatty acid metabolism, vitamin D levels, and some diet-associated diseases), pathogen resistance, and externally visible phenotypes (skin and eye pigmentation, tooth morphology, hair thickness, and body height). 60 This work demonstrated the utility of aDNA data in human adaptive evolution studies. The currently available set of published human aDNA NGS data, including sample IDs, dating, archaeological cultures, site names and locations, references, and links to data repositories, is in Supplementary Table S2 and illustrated in Fig. 2 . Geographic distribution of existing whole genome aDNA sequences.Geographic distribution of existing whole genome aDNA sequences.1.2. Historic patterns in the spread of infectious diseases Some devastating pandemics, like the Black Death, remain infamous even centuries after these catastrophes. aDNA enables discovery of the origin and spread of disease-carrying alleles to aid modern epidemiology. Such analyses are possible when genotypes of ancient humans are recovered along with the genomes of their pathogens. For example, Rasmussen et al. 67 sequenced DNA extracted from ancient human teeth and found that Yersinia pestis , the etiological agent of plague, infected humans in Bronze Age Eurasia as early as 5 kya, three millennia before the first historical records of plague. The authors concluded that the bacterium became the highly virulent, flea-borne bubonic plague strain only ~3 kya by acquiring specific genetic changes. 67 Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from remains of ancient humans and animals helped in deciphering the origin and dispersal of tuberculosis in human populations. aDNA studies provided support for the hypothesis that the appearance of tuberculosis in humans was not connected to animal domestication as it was suggested before. On the contrary, M. tuberculosis strain in humans is the most ancient one and other tuberculosis strains causing animal diseases evolved from the human strain. 68 Tuberculosis spread with humans and evolved in local conditions. 69,70 The most ancient, so far, human M. tuberculosis strain was discovered in a 9,000-yr-old pre-pottery Neolithic settlement in the Eastern Mediterranean 66 where, in spite of the presence of quantities of bovine bones, no signs of the bovine strain, M. bovis , were found. Discovery of M. bovis strain in human remains from the Iron Age (as well as animal-like Mycobacterium strains in pre-Columbian humans) showed that back-infection from animals took place 6,67 at a later time.  Studying dental plaque of Europeans from different periods (Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Early Medieval, Late Medieval, and present time) demonstrated important shifts in human oral microbiota during recent evolution. The first shift took place in the early Neolithic period with the introduction of farming when more caries- and periodontal disease-associated bacterial taxa were detected. The oral microbiota composition remained stable between the Neolithic period and modern times. Recently, possibly during the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, cariogenic bacteria became dominant, likely due to consumption of industrially processed flour and sugar. Consequently, the genetic diversity of the oral microbiotic ecosystem was impinged, which contributed to the spread of chronic oral and other diseases in countries with post-industrial lifestyles. 71 One of the most remarkable achievements in the field is the study of historical RNA. In 1997, Taubenberger et al. 19 extracted and analysed RNA from the virus that caused the ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic that killed at least 20 million people in 1918–1919. 19,72–76 Reconstruction of the viral genome helped to reveal its origin and discover the mechanism of its exceptional virulence. In contrast to modern influenza viruses, which require an exogenous protease for their replication, the 1918 pandemic virus could replicate without exogenous trypsin. The ‘Spanish flu’ viral genome contained a constellation of genes essential for optimal virulence, which contributed to the strain’s ultra-high virulence. 75 This knowledge enabled epidemiologists to develop a vaccination strategy against another potential pandemic virus. 742. Adaptation of experimental and computational methods to the specific biochemistry of aDNA After the death of an organism, all of its biomolecules are degraded either by host enzymes released from their proper compartments or by saprobic microorganisms. Therefore, compared with modern DNA, aDNA has lower concentration; it is fragmented, contaminated, and chemically modified. 16,77,78 aDNA is also commonly damaged by strand breaks and cross-linking in addition to oxidative and hydrolytic degradation of bases or sugar residues. Relative preservation of DNA in old samples depends on environmental circumstances, such as temperature, humidity, pH, or oxygen, rather than the absolute age of the sample. For instance, DNA samples extracted from frozen remains dated thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years can be of better quality than much more recent samples. 5,79–81 Recent studies showed that the age of ‘readable’ (by current methods) aDNA products is restricted to ~1–1.5 million years. 11,75 At present, the 560–780 thousand years old Middle Pleistocene horse is the most ancient organism from which reliable aDNA data have been procured. 5 Below, we describe methods for overcoming difficulties caused by each one of the special aDNA features. 2.1. Degradation Early success with aDNA extraction and sequencing raised hopes that museum specimens, ancient samples, and archaeological finds would provide a plethora of aDNA, but such hopes faded when it became clear that these old samples did not yield any usable DNA. 79 Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for aDNA projects to be disbanded due to low or undetectable DNA content 82–84 . In many other projects, the aDNA concentration is so low that it demands destructive sampling to yield adequate sequencing coverage. That, in turn, results in low genomic coverage (percentage of the length of the reference genome that is covered by mapped reads from the sample) and less reliable genotype calls. In their analysis of Neanderthal DNA, Green et al. reported GC content to be positively correlated (r = 0.49) with retrieval success of sequence fragments, 1,23,85,86 likely due to the faster denaturation of AT-rich regions. They also found G and T overrepresented at the 5' and 3' ends of break points and suggested de-purination as a significant cause of strand breaks. 23 Some of the difficulties in working with aDNA were resolved by technological breakthroughs. Improvement of extraction protocols can substantially increase the quantity and quality of aDNA. Thus, modern protocols 4,87 enable extraction and analysis of very short fragments (<50–60 bp, which constitutes the vast majority of aDNA). DNA fragmentation posed difficulties for conventional PCR, which requires amplification of a large number of overlapping fragments to cover a relatively long fragment of DNA, and it is impossible to sequence very short fragments (50–70 bp) using Sanger sequencing. However, NGS technologies generate short reads for any DNA. The average retrieved sequence length in most aDNA projects is 50–100 bp, which is the same order of magnitude as the length of reads produced by many current NGS instruments.  Fragmentation and decay of DNA is a natural occurrence not only postmortem but also in vivo . Spontaneous DNA degradation caused by damaging and mutagenic factors is prevented by DNA repair mechanisms that are not present after death. However, controlled DNA degradation in living organism is implemented during programmed cell death (apoptosis) and differentiation of certain cell types (i.e. erythroid, lens and hair cortical cells). A large family of DNase enzymes performs the DNA degradation vital for proper development and functioning of living tissues. Apoptotic processes leading to these changes and DNA degeneration explain the average length of DNA fragments of 140–160 bp and under extracted from ancient mammoth hairs. 88,89 Many processes leading to DNA degradation, including those that accompany cell and tissue senescence (telomere shortening, error accumulation during DNA synthesis), occur naturally in vivo . Apoptosis finds its continuation in postmortem tissues, leading to further fragmentation of DNA even in favourable conditions for specimen preservation. The detailed biochemistry of processes occurring after death still requires further evaluation, and elucidation of their contribution to aDNA quality might be a promising area for research. 2.2. Contamination Even after successful DNA extraction, results must always be checked for authenticity. aDNA is often contaminated with some level of exogenous DNA (e.g. DNA from ancient or modern saprotrophic bacteria or fungi), postmortem juxtaposition of organisms, or modern human DNA from the researchers themselves. Naturally, low amounts of aDNA (or its complete absence) in the sample might facilitate the domination of PCR products by exogenous DNA, resulting in the recovery of irrelevant sequences. Indeed, in 1990s, a large number of papers were published reporting DNA sequences from extremely ancient remains such as Miocene plant fossils, 90,91 amber-entombed organisms, 92,93 250-million-yr-old bacteria in salt crystal, 94 and dinosaur bones and eggs. 95–98 In one such case, researchers reported successful extraction and amplification of mtDNA cytochrome b fragment from a Cretaceous Period dinosaur. 95 The sequences differed from all modern cytochrome b sequences. This led the authors to believe that they had sequenced authentic DNA from 80-million-yr-old bones. It was later discovered that those mtDNA sequences were not close to avian and reptilian mtDNAs, as would be expected from their phylogenetic history, but rather to mammalian (including human) mtDNAs. It was thereby suggested that the alleged ‘dinosaur’ DNA was contaminated, presumably by modern human DNA. 99–102 A similar course of events occurred in the study of ancient bacterial DNA supposedly preserved in 250-million-yr-old salt crystals, which turned out to be modern bacterial DNA. 103 In addition to these examples, several other aDNA projects have been impeded by contamination of ancient samples. 98,103–106 To prevent contamination, the experiment must be properly managed, including special requirements for sample collection, sterilization of the working area, DNA authentication, and independent reproducibility. 97,107 These protocols are constantly being refined and improved. For example, in addition to mechanical removal of the upper layer and UV and/or bleach treatment of the sample, a brief pre-digestion step was recently suggested, 108 consisting of short-term sample incubation in an extraction buffer and its subsequent removal. According to the authors, this step alone increases the fraction of endogenous DNA several fold. In general, sequencing preparation step plays an important role in minimizing contamination. When there is sufficient material, sequencing library may be prepared entirely without using PCR, greatly minimizing potential for sample contamination. 109 Recent work actually takes advantage of postmortem modifications to enrich for endogenous versus contaminated sequences. 110 In shotgun sequencing of vertebrate samples, a substantial fraction of the reads comes from contamination with environmental DNA from bacteria and fungi. 2,20,111 Microbial sequences are often remarkably different from target species sequences and thus should be easily flagged by a standard BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database. This strategy, however, fails to discover most of the microbial sequences that have yet to be sequenced. Therefore, it is not surprising that a large fraction of reads in many aDNA libraries is labelled as ‘unknown’ or ‘unclassified’, mainly due to the unidentified microbial content. 86 Frequently, mapping the shotgun sequencing reads onto the reference genome of the target species (or the closest genome at hand) and discarding all reads below a certain level of similarity is preferred 112 alongside choosing tissues with less microbial DNA. For instance, it has been suggested that hair shafts or avian eggshells contain less microbial DNA than bone, 88,113 but these tissues are not available for most ancient samples. Alternatively, recovery of bacterial or fungal sequences is not very likely for PCR-based capture methods, as primers are designed based on known sequences from the sample’s own species or its close relatives.  The intricacy and method of detecting and removing modern human contamination depends on the distance of the target species from humans. Expectedly, it is much easier to handle distantly related species such as mammoths, penguins, or cave bears than archaic hominids, like the Denisovans and Neanderthals, and particularly ancient modern humans. Moreover, the archaeological material in Europe is usually excavated and later handled, extracted, and sequenced by Europeans, sometimes from the same region. The same is generally true for other territories around the world. When a limited number of loci are sequenced from PCR or cloning products, it is possible to examine alignments visually and to inspect individual polymorphic positions to determine which differences are genuine and which are likely artefacts or contamination; 114,115 however, with reads from shotgun sequencing technologies, automated methods are typically required.  Analysing sequence reads in a phylogenetic framework along with sequences from ancient and extant relatives and outgroups is one of the initial steps to ensure that ancient sequences fit within the acceptable phylogeny and flag probable contamination. For instance, sequences from the mammoth were compared with those of the elephant, its closest kin, and to outgroups, such as humans and dogs, to ascertain phylogenetic correctness. 20 Filtering reads that were mapped onto the elephant genome with a high score and matched the elephant genome better than that of human, dog, or other species helped to remove human and microbial contamination. Neanderthal samples were phylogenetically examined to see if they fall outside the range of modern human variation. 48 Initially, a number of human and non-human studies filtered out samples with long sequence fragments considered evidence of contamination since authentic aDNA is supposed to be fragmented. 82,115 However, it has become clear that the average aDNA fragment length can vary substantially between samples and can overlap with contaminant fragment lengths; therefore, more elegant approaches are needed to develop authentication criteria based on length. In a study of Neanderthal DNA, estimates of human-Neanderthal sequence divergence and the percentage of C<U+2192>T and G<U+2192>A (equivalent events) misincorporations did not vary significantly with alignment length. 116 Existence of substantial modern DNA contamination would have produced two types of fragments: authentic ancient ones which were short and had high numbers of mismatches (showed high divergence versus modern human reference), and modern contaminant ones which were long and showed few mismatches (showed low divergence versus modern human reference). Noonan et al. 116 remarked that the absence of an inverse relationship between alignment length and divergence from the human reference meant that the level of contamination with modern DNA was negligible in their data set; however, they did not provide a quantitative estimate. The problem with this approach is that even among authentic ancient fragments, short fragments presumably represent higher rates of base modification and consequently may produce upward-biased divergence estimates. 85 Through the accumulation of ancient sequences over time, positions at which the target sequence (e.g. Neanderthal or Denisovan) have been invariably different from the likely contaminant (e.g. modern humans) can be used to estimate modern DNA contamination. 23,117,118 Here, mtDNA is the marker of choice because of its high copy number, leading to greater sequencing depth; however, the validity of extrapolating mtDNA contamination estimates to nuclear sequences has been questioned based on possible differences in the conservation properties of mtDNA and nuclear DNA. 85 As base modification and misincorporations in aDNA often involve C to U (T) and A to G transitions, contamination with external DNA can be more reliably estimated using transversion or indel counts. 23 Even when sufficient prior data on sequence variation in the archaic hominid population is available, the fraction of reads that deviate from consensus base calls at haploid loci, e.g. those on mtDNA or the Y-chromosome, can provide an estimate of exogenous DNA—assuming that authentic aDNA is more abundant than contamination and that correct sequence reads are more likely than errors. This method is especially applicable to positions at which the modern human population is fixed for the derived base while the archaic consensus base is ancestral. 3,53 Ancient modern humans are not expected to carry informative (fixed) substitutions compared with contemporary humans or necessarily to fall outside the range of modern human phylogeny, although they might do so. A first step in the QC of sequences from ancient modern human samples is to ascertain that all sequence reads come from a single individual. This can be done by estimating X-linked heterozygosity in male samples, Y-linked heterozygosity in male samples, Y-linked presence in female samples, or mtDNA heterozygosity for either gender. 2,53,85,119 Next, it is necessary to show that each specimen in the data set carries unique sequences (e.g. mtDNA or Y-chromosome haplotypes) that are different from sequences of other specimens and from the researchers. 83,120,121 As most of the ancient sequences during the pre-NGS era or shortly thereafter were limited to mitochondrial markers, 23,122,123 it was crucial to distinguish them from nuclear inserts of mtDNA (NUMTs). Generally, a higher alignment score to the mitochondrial sequence than to the nuclear sequences is the authentication criterion. For extinct species without a reference, where sequence reads must be mapped to the genome of another species, this becomes more complicated because the divergence of orthologous sequences must be considered in addition to differences between NUMTs and their mitochondrial counterparts. 23 Considering the low likelihood of heteroplasmy, observing more than one allele with non-negligible frequencies at each position would indicate either external contamination or sequencing of NUMTs. 2.3. Postmortem base modificationPostmortem DNA modifications through hydrolysis and oxidation pose another substantial difficulty for studying aDNA. The most significant alteration is nucleotide deamination, which leads to false transitions during PCR: cytosine to uracil, 5-methyl-cytosine to thymine (both causing incorporation of T instead of C), and, more rarely, adenine to hypoxanthine (causing incorporation of G instead of A). 82,124–127 Chemical modification of nucleotides can lead to reduced sequencing coverage because they prevent mapping of many authentic reads due to an overestimated number of mismatches compared with the reference. They can also result in the erroneous base and genotype calls and false estimates of genomic parameters such as heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, GC content, or divergence times. Base modifications are often observed in the five to seven final bases of DNA fragments and are thought to occur more readily in the terminal, single-stranded overhangs. 128 These terminal misincorporations are even more problematic because local sequence alignment methods used for mapping the NGS reads onto the reference genome rely heavily on matching initial bases to the reference. 86 To overcome problems with chemical modification, several approaches have been developed. Treatment with uracil- N -glycosylase (UNG) removes uracil residues, thus preventing replication of fragments with deaminated cytosine; 124,129 however, the resulting abasic sites prevent replication by DNA polymerases, which excludes all the fragments with uracil from the reaction. This can be crucial for valuable ancient samples already having low DNA concentrations. A simple modification was suggested recently to overcome this problem: 130 follow-up treatment with endonuclease VIII after UNG repairs most of the abasic sites and enables subsequent analysis of these fragments. This procedure, however, does not resolve the problem of false A<U+2192>G transitions. Using DNA polymerases such as Phusion ( Pfu ), which does not amplify uracil, also avoids false C<U+2192>T (but not A<U+2192>G) transitions but excludes all uracil-containing fragments from amplification, which further decreases the DNA template in the reaction. In addition, since these enzymes can work with methylated, deaminated cytosine (i.e. 5-methyluracil, thymine), the problem remains for methylated aDNA. Single primer extension PCR (SP-PCR) enables analysis of separate DNA strands, which makes it possible both to distinguish real mutations from postmortem modifications and to evaluate the level of these modifications. 124–127,131 SP-PCR is performed in two steps: first, PCR with only one primer is carried out to accumulate only one DNA strand, and then the second primer is added to the reaction and PCR continues with a normal protocol. The resulting PCR product derives mainly from one of the DNA strands. Analysis of these products can identify in which DNA strand postmortem modification occurred. This method requires very thorough selection of PCR primers and annealing temperatures, otherwise non-specific annealing or formation of primer dimers is highly possible.  One estimation strategy for base modification compares the percentage of T and A calls at ultra-conserved C and G positions, respectively. These genomic positions are expected to have retained their ancestral state in the ancient sample, so transitions exclusively observed in the ancient sample can be attributed to base misincorporations. 4,89 Another method compares the frequencies of different types of transitions and transversions in ancient–modern and modern–modern sequence alignments of closely related species (e.g. Neanderthal–human, Neanderthal–chimp, and human–chimp). An excess of C<U+2192>T (and G<U+2192>A, respectively) transitions in modern–ancient alignments provides an estimate of base modification. 86 The third strategy takes advantage of the direction of transition induced by base modification. In a 2006 study, the C<U+2192>U modification in mammoth DNA caused the apparent rate of (mammoth T) <U+2192> (elephant C) transitions to be 1.9-fold larger that of (mammoth C) <U+2192> (elephant T) transitions. 20 Recently developed experimental protocols, such as pre-treatment of aDNA with UNG, have reduced the magnitude of this problem.  If the level of base modification is non-negligible, steps must be taken to eliminate or lessen its effect on the output of downstream population genetic analyses. Sometimes, C<U+2192>T/G<U+2192>A or all transitions are simply left out of the analyses, and only transversions and indels are included in the calculation of divergence or reconstruction of phylogeny. 1 Alternatively, it is possible to polarize polymorphisms into ancestral and derived states using an outgroup (e.g. chimp for human–Neanderthal comparisons) to place the mutation events on the corresponding branches of the phylogenetic tree using a parsimony approach (of which the branch leading to the ancient sample will probably contain disproportionately high numbers) and to calculate divergence times using information from branches leading to modern samples only. 86 Another strategy takes advantage of the observation that most of the base modifications occur at the 5' and 3' ends of fragments and trims a few (5–7) bases off either end of each sequence read to lower the chance of including a misincorporated base. 2,119 Although the problems associated with aDNA anomalies are not insurmountable using available experimental and bioinformatics technologies, drastic variations in the type and magnitude of damage among ancient remains make it impossible to develop a universally successful protocol for aDNA extraction and sequencing. For instance, the fraction of authentic Neanderthal mtDNA among six examined ancient samples varied from ~1% to ~99%, 86 and the level of contamination in five well-preserved human bone specimens dated 800–1600 CE varied from 0% to 100%. 120 The Neanderthal mitochondrial genome and partial nuclear genome were retrieved using data from several sequencing attempts. 48,86,116 This compendium was crucial in determining design parameters for assembling the full Neanderthal nuclear genome. 8 The contaminating sequences in an ancient maize microsatellite genotyping project were found to be of different natures across samples: some exhibited mainly microbial contamination, whereas others contained copies of transposable elements. 82 Therefore, an initial round of extraction and sequencing is recommended to estimate quality parameters for each sample (e.g. yield, chemical modification, % contamination, % uniquely mapped reads, and % genome covered) to inform appropriate experimental and data preparation strategies. It is also important to remember that both experimental and computational methods of the overcoming of aDNA problems have advantages and limitations. Therefore, to achieve the most reliable results, it is of great importance that researchers use both these approaches to examine aDNA ( Table 1 ). One of the good examples of the combination of novel experimental and computational approaches, as well as of the good correspondence of the methods to the goal is the paper of Haak et al. 12 where they employed powerful experimental protocols, stringent quality control procedure, as well as bioinformatics and population genetics approaches to test hypotheses about the steppe origin of Indo-European languages carriers.

In addition, various bioinformatics ideas for tackling contamination and base damage are sometimes integrated into a single Maximum Likelihood framework for base and genotype calling.3. Analysis of aDNA data3.1. Software tools for pre-processing of aDNA NGS data An important consideration for the analysis of aDNA, which typically undergoes many rounds of amplification, is the presence of PCR duplicates, which must be identified, and ideally removed. 132 Once the sources of contamination or base misincorporation are detected and removed from the aDNA sequences, it is possible to infer genotypes for further analysis. In addition to regular NGS data quality control and pre-processing steps, application of specialized tools is required to address the special features of aDNA. Genotypes can be inferred more accurately by combining observed read bases with various estimators of contamination, base modification, sequencing error, and read alignment quality combined via a single maximum likelihood (ML) calculation. 133 The ML model can be designed in the haploid mode for mtDNA, or X- and Y-chromosomes in males, or diploid mode for autosomal markers or X-linked markers in females. 2 Depending on the specific design, ML models can use these estimators to output the genotype or co-estimate all of these parameters simultaneously.  Current NGS analyses of aDNA are performed with well-established but non-specialized computational tools as novel customized tools for aDNA analysis have not yet been widely accepted, and custom scripts have to be written to adjust for aDNA specifics. Base calling is frequently performed with Illumina’s standard base-caller Bustard BayesCall 134 (flexible model-based tool) and freeIbis 135 (utilizing a multiclass Support Vector Machine algorithm). FastQC 136 is typically used for preliminary quality control of reads. AdapterRemoval, 137 CutAdapt, 138 and SeqPrep 139 are currently the most common tools in the aDNA world for de-multiplexing, adapter trimming, low-quality call trimming, and paired-end merging. Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and Bowtie are commonly used for mapping of aDNA reads. 140 Since BWA and Bowtie were developed for high-quality modern DNA reads, parameter adjustments to reflect properties of a DNA must be done. For example, it may be advisable to trim likely damaged positions, disable the seed, adjust gap openings and penalties, and permit indels at read ends. 140 Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) 141,142 or SAMtools 143 are then used for variant calling. Methods should be optimized for shorter (17–35 nucleotide) reads with possible adapters on both ends of the read and a large overlap between paired reads, and the call corresponding to the highest quality score should be selected at each position. In addition, due to low quantities of endogenous DNA, the high number of short reads, and high levels of contamination, masking repeat regions may improve read mapping. Several pipelines (e.g. aLib 144 and PALEOMIX 145 ) incorporating all these changes were designed for aDNA analysis. Sometimes selected elements of such pipelines are combined to achieve optimal performance. For instance, the leeHom module of aLib is used to pre-process reads 146 while Anfo, 1 MIA, 117 and BWA-PSSM 147 are used for subsequent read mapping.  After read pre-treatment and alignment, the text file containing the sequence alignment data (termed the SAM file or BAM for binary files) can be used to estimate contamination and degradation levels using tools such as mapDamage 148 and mapDamage2.0. 149 PMDtools 150 (identification of those DNA fragments that are unlikely to come from modern sources) and Schmutzi 151 (maximum a posteriori estimator of mitochondrial contamination for ancient samples) are utilized to select reads for re-analysis that have higher chances of coming from aDNA. Depending on the situation, analysis can be done in a fully automated cycle for the entire genome or only for mtDNA. Such algorithms report the probabilities of different types of postmortem DNA degradation, which allows for better statistical modelling at the variant calling stage, employing SNPest 152 or custom scripts. A typical NGS pipeline for aDNA analysis is shown in Fig. 3 . Flowchart of a typical bioinformatics pipeline for aDNA analysis using NGS data.Flowchart of a typical bioinformatics pipeline for aDNA analysis using NGS data.The amount of extracted endogenous DNA may allow satisfactory coverage of aDNA sequences (as high as 10–20x coverage at a subset of regions for a few samples), comparable to modern DNA studies. Nevertheless, it is very common for ancient samples to have ~1× average coverage. In such cases, population genetics analysis can still be done using ADMIXTURE and other standard tools by choosing the variant with the highest number of supporting reads (or with the highest quality) instead of trying to make heterozygous/homozygous calls at each autosomal position (which is tricky when there are <5 reads covering a given position resulting in 3–4 conflicting variants). This method can be used when the amount of contaminating modern human DNA is much lower than the amount of endogenous DNA. Special care needs to be exercised when combining SNP data from ancient and modern samples. Recently published analysis of the first ancient African genome 26 presented an erroneous conclusion that genomes of individuals throughout Africa contain DNA inherited from Eurasian immigrants. 153 The error was noticed, and the authors published an erratum stating that it had been necessary to convert the input produced by SAMtools to be compatible with PLINK, but this step was omitted causing the removal of many positions homozygous to the human reference genome. 153 This example illustrates the importance of using validated pipelines for aDNA analysis. 3.2. Interpretation of aDNA data Below, we discuss the analytical methods for biologically relevant interpretation of aDNA data. Various population genetics analytical methods have been applied to infer past demographic events based on data obtained from aDNA studies. One of the basic methods for identifying ancient haplotypes is scanning present-day populations for variants identified in the aDNA. This simple approach provides an estimate of populations/regions that harbour such ancient genetic signatures and has been successfully applied to identify modern European populations with mtDNA mutations that were found in aDNA samples. 154,155 Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prehistoric samples can shed light on ancestral phenotypes, including pigmentation of skin, hair, and eyes, 37 and the sex of the sample can be computed as the ratio of reads mapping to the Y- and X-chromosomes. 156,157 In the case of uni-parental markers such as mtDNA variants and Y-chromosome markers, the mutational distance between the ancient and modern haplotypes is visualized using phylogenetic network analysis programmes. 155,158 Network analysis of haplotype data reveals genetic distance, mutation rate, and regions of haplotype spread. Recently, a novel method for dating ancient human samples was developed. 159 The method is based on a recombination clock and shared history of Neanderthal gene flow into non-Africans. 159 With increased numbers of recovered ancient and historic DNA samples and steady improvements in aDNA sequencing technology, scientists can study the distribution of ancient human genetic variation and compare it to that of modern populations 160 or gain a deeper level understanding of the distribution of genetic variation within populations by applying admixture-based tools for joint analysis of modern and ancient samples at a population level. Tools and approaches (such as PCA, 161 STRUCTURE, 162 ADMIXTURE, 163 SPAMIX, 164 SPA, 165 ADMIXTOOLS, 166 GPS, 167 LAMP, 168 HAPMIX, 169 reAdmix, 170 MUTLIMIX, 171 mSpectrum, 172 SABER, 173 and others) which were initially developed for population analysis of contemporary individuals, can be applied in combination with anthropological data and historical records to reconstruct migration patterns, provenances, and local and global ancestries of extinct populations. ADMIXTURE is a computational tool for ML estimation of individual ancestries from multi-locus SNP genotype data sets. Recently, Allentoft et al. 11 inferred the ancestral components from modern samples and then projected the ancient samples onto the inferred components using the ancestral allele frequencies inferred by ADMIXTURE. Comparison of admixture profiles of ancient and modern populations within a given region informs the generation of hypotheses about population migrations that can be validated with independent sources and methods of analysis. NGSADMIX uses genotype likelihoods instead of called genotypes to resolve ancestry, which is particularly useful considering the myriad sources of uncertainty in aDNA NGS data. 174 GPS algorithm determines the provenance of an individual—a point on a globe where people with similar genotype live. Tools like SPAMIX and reAdmix model individual as a weighted sum of reference populations.  To infer the geographical origin of a specific haplotype, it is essential to partition the genome into haplotypes with distinct ancestries that may have been inherited from multiple populations. Such haplotypes can be obtained using ‘local ancestry’ tools (HAPMIX, or SABER, LAMP, and MULTIMIX and others) which allow inference of ‘local ancestry’ instead of the ‘global ancestry’ (that can be inferred with PCA, SPAMIX, GPS, ADMIXTURE, STRUCTURE, reAdmix) and their usage depends on the complexity of the data set, the expected mixture levels, and the available phenotypic data. For instance, if the phenotype is associated with a particular trait, a ‘local ancestry’ tool is preferred, whereas a ‘global ancestry’ tool should be used when the phenotype is a complex trait involving multiple unknown loci. The list of the described software tools is shown in Supplementary Table S1 .  When several individuals of an ancient population are available, certain population genetic parameters can be estimated. For example, by examining a number of microsatellite loci in 160- to 200-yr-old Daphnia samples, 175 researchers were able to calculate the heterozygosity, gene diversity, deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium between pairs of markers. An analysis of 21 samples from a graveyard in Germany dated ~6 kya allowed analysis of the mtDNA and Y-chromosomal haplotype diversity as well as the selection forces inferred from Tajima’s D. 83 Jaenicke-Despres et al. 176 discovered allelic variants of three genes that differentiate modern maize and teosinte from 11 maize cobs dating to 660–4,400 yrs ago, opening a window to the genetic chronology of maize domestication. It should be noted, that quantitative data, such as allele frequencies from multiple poorly preserved sample should be treated with caution, as postmortem DNA degradation can bias allele frequency estimates. 109 However, population genetics also offers a range of neutrality tests, such as Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, which can be used to check for the presence or artefactual sites, when compared with the present-day data.  Even when only a single member of an ancient population can be recovered, a number of genomic and evolutionary inferences can be made about its taxon or population. For example, based on remarkably low levels of dN/dS (non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio), it was concluded that mitochondrial proteins were under strong purifying selection in Denisovans 50 . Conversely, the higher dN/dS ratio calculated from Neanderthal genomes was attributed to smaller effective population size and inefficient purifying selection 23,117 The heterozygosity of the TAS2R38 locus in a single Neanderthal individual was used to infer that he was a bitter-taster and, further, that this trait varied among Neanderthals 177 correlation along the genome, it was suggested that the Denisovans experienced a 30-fold decrease in effective population size compared with African humans. 178 Sporadic calculations from museum data can likewise be extremely useful in inferring population history, e.g. for determining genetic continuity of populations. 1794. Beyond DNA sequence: ancient epigenomics Many human phenotypes, including physical and psychological characteristics and predispositions to chronic diseases, arise from complex patterns of gene expression, which are, in turn, influenced by poorly understood interactions of so-called ‘genetic determinants’ and external environmental signals. These intricate interactions are commonly explained by (equally poorly understood) epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and a spectrum of non-coding RNAs that modify the structure of chromatin and modulate gene expression. Until recently, reconstructing the gene expression profile of specific postmortem samples using only DNA was deemed impossible. Several research groups analysing the methylation maps (methylome) of Neanderthals proposed that patterns of CpG methylation could be preserved in the DNA. 130,180 In 2012, Llamas et al. 181 applied bisulphite allelic sequencing of loci to late Pleistocene Bison priscus remains and demonstrated preservation of methylation patterns, although postmortem deamination of methylated cytosine to thymine prevented accurate quantification of methylated cytosine levels.  In 2014, another approach for genome-wide methylation studies of ancient samples was suggested. 25,180,182 In bisulphite sequencing, unmethylated cytosines are chemically converted into uracils, which are then amplified by some polymerases, such as Taq , as thymines (T), while mC is unaffected and is amplified as C. In postmortem samples C<U+2192>U and mC<U+2192>T spontaneous conversions occur naturally. To discriminate between C<U+2192>U and mC<U+2192>T, the same fragments must be amplified by two different polymerases ( Fig. 4 ). Taq DNA polymerases can replicate through uracils, while high-fidelity DNA polymerases, like Phusion ( Pfu ), cannot. Thus, it is possible to detect methylated cytosines in aDNA by their elevated C/T mismatch rates as compared with unmethylated cytosines. However, analysis of aDNA methylation is limited to ~10 nucleotides from the fragment’s ends. There are two reasons for this. First, the probability of deamination drops exponentially with the distance of a C nucleotide from the fragment’s end. 130 Second, the further the methylated C is located from the fragment’s end, the higher the probability that Pfu will encounter (and will fail to bypass) uracil originated from the conversion of unmethylated cytosine and will not reach C.  Epigenetic analysis of aDNA. As a result of cytosine and methyl-cytosine deamination in postmortem sample, we observe C<U+2192>U and mC<U+2192>T conversions. When Taq polymerase is used for DNA amplification, both C<U+2192>U and mC<U+2192>T will be recorded as T (this is the major difference between ancient and bisulphite-treated samples when only unmethylated cytosine in converted to U while mC remains unchanged). When Pfu polymerase is used, U will not be amplified, while those T that appeared as a result of mC<U+2192>T conversion will be read as T. The pie charts demonstrate the ratio of sequenced C to T. This C/T ratio with Taq and Pfu along with comparison with the reference genome allows detection of methylated cytosines: in the case of postmortem deamination C<U+2192>U and PCR by Pfu the frequency of T will be decreased.  Epigenetic analysis of aDNA. As a result of cytosine and methyl-cytosine deamination in postmortem sample, we observe C<U+2192>U and mC<U+2192>T conversions. When Taq polymerase is used for DNA amplification, both C<U+2192>U and mC<U+2192>T will be recorded as T (this is the major difference between ancient and bisulphite-treated samples when only unmethylated cytosine in converted to U while mC remains unchanged). When Pfu polymerase is used, U will not be amplified, while those T that appeared as a result of mC<U+2192>T conversion will be read as T. The pie charts demonstrate the ratio of sequenced C to T. This C/T ratio with Taq and Pfu along with comparison with the reference genome allows detection of methylated cytosines: in the case of postmortem deamination C<U+2192>U and PCR by Pfu the frequency of T will be decreased.  The described strategy was applied to analyse aDNA from Neanderthal (50 kya), Denisovan (40 kya), and a relatively recent Palaeo-Eskimo individual (4 kya). Overall, DNA methylation patterns in ancient human bones or hairs were almost indistinguishable from those in modern humans. However, by examining differentially methylated regions, Gokhman et al. 180 found that some key regulators of limb development, like HOXD9 and HOXD10 , had methylated promoters (in Neanderthal) and gene bodies (in Denisovan), whereas these regions are hypo-methylated in bones of present-day humans. Deregulation of the HOXD cluster genes results in morphological changes in mice. 183 Since this deregulation corresponds to Neanderthal–modern human differences, it can be inferred that epigenetic changes in the HOXD clusters might have played a key role in the recent evolution of human limbs. Differentially methylated regions were also found within the MEIS1 gene, which encodes a protein that controls the activity of the HOXD cluster. 183 Interpretation of ancient methylome from aggregated C/T mismatch information over large genomic regions allows to determine whether extended regions with altered DNA methylation were present in ancient samples. These include not only hypermethylated CpG islands but also (i) large (from 10 5 to 10 6  bp long) partially methylated gene-poor domains that co-localize with lamina-associated domains; 184,185 (ii) DNA methylation valleys extending over several kb of DNA, which are strongly hypomethylated in most tissues, enriched in transcription factors and developmental genes; 186,187 (iii) undermethylated canyons (up to dozens of kb) that were recently identified in hematopoietic stem cells; 188 and (iv) epigenetic programmes associated with intestinal inflammation and characterized by hypermethylation of DNA methylation valleys with low CpG density and active chromatin marks. 189 Methylation analysis typically focuses on genomic regions that span several kb or even mb. 187–189 The C<U+2192>T mismatch aggregation strategy, applied in a recent aDNA epigenomic study, 25 could yield new perspectives on adaptation signals and disease markers if soft tissues are found. Brain, intestine, muscle, and blood are not normally preserved in anthropological samples, and extreme conditions (such as permafrost soil) are required for preservation. Analysis of epigenetic patterns also allows estimation of the individual’s age at death using a recent forensic study that found a correlation between the methylation state of specific CpGs and the age of an individual. 190 Such calculations are based on the assumption that environmental signals 6 kya produced the same genomic methylation response observed today to estimate the age of ancient humans using modern databases. Using this approach, Pedersen et al. 25 calculated that the Saqqaq individual was probably in his late thirties when he died.  Methylated CpG’s are almost exclusively found in vertebrate somatic cells; bacterial genomes feature methylated cytosines and adenines but rarely in a CpG context. Hence, CpG methylation levels can be used to enrich the endogenous content of a human aDNA sample and separate it from bacterial contaminants. 191 Methyl DNA binding domain (MBD) affinity chromatography, allowing separation of methylated DNA probes containing a single methylated CpG, has become a routine method for establishing methylomes of genomes of different origins. 192 Application of this method to aDNA can facilitate characterization of ancient methylomes and separate vertebrate and microbial fractions of aDNA extracts. Using the remains of the Saqqaq Palaeo-Eskimo individual, woolly mammoths, polar bears, and two equine species, methylation marks were shown to survive in a variety of tissues and environmental contexts and over a large temporal span (>45–4 kya). Additionally, MBD enrichment allows microbiome characterization for ancient samples and potentially reconstruction of genomes of ancient pathogens.  Although DNA methylation may serve as an indicator of gene silencing, epigenetic analysis alone is insufficient to determine whether the gene was destined for transcription or silencing. Additional data, such as histone modification marks, chromatin structure, and transcription factor binding information, are essential for gene activity prediction. Even though research on ancient proteins is at the nascent stage, shotgun sequencing of aDNA provides a surprisingly rich source of epigenetic information. Pedersen et al. 25 observed unexpected periodicity in the density of covered nucleotides along the Saqqaq genome and hypothesized that these periodic patterns could stem from the protection of DNA by nucleosome binding with preferential degradation of linker regions between nucleosomes. Under this scenario, the observed read depth would reflect the nucleosome occupancy. Analysis of the spectral density (periodogram) in transcription start site (TSS) regions showed that the frequency spectrum has a peak in the relative signal at 193 bp corresponding to the expected inter-nucleosome distance. 25 Moreover, a phasogram from Fourier transform revealed a short-range (10 bp) periodicity, reflecting preferential shifts in nucleosome positioning every 10 bp and/or preferential cleavage of the DNA backbone facing away from nucleosome protection. 193 Strongly positioned nucleosomes in an ancient sample were also found within the vicinity (4 kb) of the transcriptional repressor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites, and their order was negatively correlated with uncovered DNA methylation. 25 Since DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) near the TSS are reliable predictive markers for gene transcription, 194 regions within open chromatin structures may be more susceptible to postmortem or apoptosis-induced DNase cleavage, in which case the density of NGS reads near the TSS of active genes would be lower than at silent genes. Based on read density at known TSSs and DHSs from the ENCODE project and using de novo methods of TSS prediction (e.g. NPEST 195 or TSSer 196 ), it is possible to sort TSSs according to transcriptional activity of corresponding genes. In the near future, it may be feasible to quantitatively reconstruct gene expression patterns of ancient samples by combining nucleosome positioning, the presence of DHSs at TSSs, and DNA methylation. Therefore, analysis of preserved brains, such as those from bog bodies, 197 will be of particular interest. Recently found remains of a woolly mammoth that retained brain structures of a very high quality 198 raised hopes that exciting discoveries are on the horizon that would allow us to test whether the higher nervous system activity in modern humans differs from that of ancient humans at the epigenetic level. 199,200ConclusionsaDNA research has revolutionized a multitude of scientific disciplines. Representing the most direct route to address a large number of questions in evolution, medicine, anthropology, and history, aDNA became an indispensable tool in population genetics, paleo-epidemiology, and related fields. Analysis of aDNA has made tremendous progress since its humble beginning in the early 1990s, when contamination with modern DNA sources was commonplace, and only limited analysis was possible due to DNA fragmentation and sparse sampling. In this review, we attempted to provide a detailed overview of recent innovations aimed at coping with these limitations, both through experimental procedures and bioinformatics algorithms. We also considered challenges regarding aDNA biochemistry and degradation, particular bioinformatics tools compensating for short reads and gaps in sequencing coverage, and advances in population genetics to handle sparse sampling. Finally, we described the particularities of aDNA epigenetics and functional interpretation of deduced activities of genes and pathways. In envisioning future progress in aDNA studies, we would like to note that not every advance in genomics or experimental biology may affect the field. Recent breakthroughs in genomic technologies drastically increased the amount of information obtained from aDNA, and new inventions, e.g. progress in targeted enrichment methods and single-molecule sequencing, would likely allow investigation of previously intractable samples from hot climates and more distant eras. However, experimental approaches will always be limited by the quantity and quality of aDNA in ancient remains. Thus, development of computational methods to cope with aDNA-specific biases and extract meaningful information from low-coverage aDNA data is critical. Studies of aDNA will hugely benefit from further improvement of sophisticated bioinformatics tools coupled with the rapid accumulation of content (reference genomes and variant databases) from both ancient samples and freshly sequenced modern human populations. Regarding the latter, one can hardly overestimate the effect of international projects on systematic genotyping and sequencing of small and/or remote human populations (see, e.g. recent sequencing of 236 individuals from 125 distinct human populations by Sudmant et al., 201 a study of 456 geographically diverse high-coverage Y chromosome sequences to infer second strong bottleneck in Y-chromosome lineage by Karmin et al., 202 genotyping and comprehensive analysis of 2,039 samples from rural areas within UK by Leslie et al., 203 as well as many others projects 13,158,167,204–208 ). Parallel improvement of experimental and computational methods will enable studies of ancient populations instead of just a few individuals, and new studies of this kind are emerging now. 11,12,28 The utility of aDNA data will increase with further progress in the genotype-to-phenotype mapping of humans. For the first time, we can anticipate the direct study of evolution for traits that are not associated with the fossil record, such as metabolic and behavioural details. aDNA will provide an important source of information on the origins of cells that harboured DNA thousands of years ago, the age of samples at the time of death, and the environmental influences. Altogether, analysis of aDNA will help us to better understand our world and our role in it. FundingI.M. was supported by Swiss Mäxi Foundation grant.

The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families involved in plant development and stress response. Although many WRKY genes have been studied in cultivated rice ( Oryza sativa ), the WRKY genes in the wild rice species Oryza nivara , the direct progenitor of O. sativa , have not been studied. O. nivara shows abundant genetic diversity and elite drought and disease resistance features. Herein, a total of 97 O. nivara WRKY ( OnWRKY ) genes were identified. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that OnWRKY genes were generally expressed at higher levels in the roots of 30-day-old plants. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that most of OnWRKY genes could be induced by salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and drought. Abundant potential MAPK phosphorylation sites in OnWRKYs suggest that activities of most OnWRKYs can be regulated by phosphorylation. Phylogenetic analyses of OnWRKYs support a novel hypothesis that ancient group IIc OnWRKYs were the original ancestors of only some group IIc and group III WRKYs. The analyses also offer strong support that group IIc OnWRKYs containing the HVE sequence in their zinc finger motifs were derived from group Ia WRKYs. This study provides a solid foundation for the study of the evolution and functions of WRKY genes in O. nivara . 1. Introduction Since the first WRKY gene was reported for sweet potato in 1994, 1 many WRKY genes have been identified in a wide variety of organisms. 2–9 A large majority of WRKY genes function as a positive or negative regulators in plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. 10 Because stress responses of plants are often involved in hormone signalling, WRKY proteins have been demonstrated to mediate the crosstalk of hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid, and ethylene. 9,11–17 In addition, WRKY genes also play a role in the control of leaf senescence and seed development. 18–23 In these physiological processes, WRKY genes are regulated by multiple factors, 24 and most of which involve phosphorylation. 25–27 Several WRKY proteins have been shown to be phosphorylated by MAPKs. These transcription factors usually contain conserved motifs for phosphorylation by MAPKs. 28–30 WRKY transcription factors contain one or two WRKY domains that are composed of a WRKY motif and a zinc finger motif. The core sequence of a WRKY motif is WRKYGQK with some variants including WRKYGKK, WRKYGEK, WRKYGRK, WKKYGQK, WKRYGQK, and WSKYEQK. 7,31 Two types of zinc fingers, the C 2 H 2 motif (C–X 4–5 –C–X 22–23 –H–X 1 –H) and the C 2 HC motif (C–X 5–7 –C–X 23 –H–X 1 –C), are found in WRKY proteins. 8,32WRKY genes are usually divided into three groups, groups I, II, and III. 8,32 Group I has two WRKY domains; group II has one WRKY domain with a C 2 H 2 zinc finger; and group III has one WRKY domain with a C 2 HC zinc finger. Group I was subsequently divided into two subgroups, Ia containing C 2 H 2 zinc fingers and Ib containing C 2 HC zinc fingers. Group II was subsequently divided into five subgroups, IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, and IIe, based on their phylogenetic relationship. 8,32 Current publications support the fact that WRKY group II should be divided into three subgroups, IIa + b, IIc, and IId + e, because the IIa and IIb subgroups, as well as the IId and IIe subgroups always cluster into a single clade. 2,33 Genes with an incomplete WRKY domain were assigned to group IV. 32 The Oryza genus contains 23 species and 9 recognized genome types. 34 The AA type genome is present in Oryza sativa rice and its relatives, as well as the Oryza glaberrima and its relatives. They are thought to be an example of parallel evolution in crop plants. 34,35 The O.sativa , as well as its close wild relatives—perennial Oryza rufipogon and annual Oryza nivara , originated in the south Asia area. 36,O.nivara , the direct progenitor of the O.sativa L., has abundant genetic diversity 35,37,38 and elite features of drought and disease resistance. 39–41 Considering the diverse functions of WRKY genes in various physiological and developmental processes, comprehensive studies of the WRKY gene family in O.nivara will shed light on the evolution of this wild rice species and on the functions of this large family of transcription factors. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Genomic datasets The genomic data of O.nivara Sharma et Shastry and O.sativa L. ssp. indica were downloaded from GRAMENE ( http://www.gramene.org/ ). A hidden Markov model (HMM) was constructed using the O.sativa WRKY proteins 32,42 and then was used to identify the WRKY proteins in the O.nivara genome using HMMER 3.1b2 43 with a cut-off E -value of 0.001. The orthologues were identified by comparing the WRKY sequences in O.nivara and those in O.sativa ssp. japonica ( Osj ) via batch BLASTp. 44 The gene IDs of the OnWRKYs were determined based on their closest relatives to O.sativa .  Nomenclature of On WRKY genes were based on their homology to OsjWRKY genes. OsWRKY genes have had conflicting names in the past and a solution was proposed by the Committee on Gene Symbolization, Nomenclature and Linkage (CGSNL). 45,46 We performed BLASTP queries using all 127 putative OnWRKY proteins against the 135 putative OsjWRKY proteins, and assigned names to the OnWRKY genes based on their closest homologous OsjWRKY proteins. This should facilitate future research of the WRKY genes in rice. We recommend that the same nomenclature be utilized in all Oryzoideae plants. 2.2. Classification of the OnWRKY genes The full-length protein sequences of the OnWRKY proteins were aligned by the MUSCLE method embedded in MEGA6.0 47 and classified into groups based on their WRKY domains, as in previous publications. 8,32,42,48 In brief, OnWRKYs are divided into groups I, II, III, and IV. Group I consists of two subgroups. Subgroup Ia OnWRKYs contain two WRKY domains with C 2 H 2 zinc fingers, and subgroup Ib OnWRKYs contains two WRKY domains with C 2 HC zinc fingers. The group II WRKY proteins contain one WRKY domain with a C 2 H 2 zinc finger. Group II was further divided into five subgroups based on presence of specific sequences in their zinc finger motifs. Subgroup IIa contains CX 5 CPVKKK(L/V)Q motif, IIb CX 5 CPVRKQVQ, IIc CX 4 C, IId CX 5 CPARKHVE, and IIe CX 5 CPARK(Q/M)V(E/D). Group III WRKY proteins contain one WRKY domain with a C 2 HC zinc finger. 8,32 The WRKY proteins with incomplete WRKY domains were classified as group IV. 322.3. Phylogenetic analyses The WRKY domains and the full-length protein sequences of the OnWRKY genes were used to analyse their phylogenetic relationship. The amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE in MEGA 6.0 with default parameters and then adjusted manually to the best possible alignment. 47 The unrooted neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the aligned WRKY domains (including both N-terminal and C-terminal domains) and full predicted protein sequences of the OnWRKY genes using MEGA 6.0 with bootstrap replications of 1000. 2.4. Visualization of chromosomal location and transcript structures of OnWRKY genes To determine the chromosomal locations of the OnWRKY genes, the locus coordinates and gene sizes were extracted from genome data using an in-house PERL program. The distribution of OnWRKY genes on the chromosomes was analysed using MAPchart 2.3. 49 The transcript structures and positions of the WRKY and zinc finger motifs were generated using the Transcript Structure and Domain Display software. 502.5. Intron, exon, and motif analyses The exons, introns, and their relative peptide sequences were extracted from the genomic data using an in-house PERL program. The positions of the intron/exon boundaries were analysed and visualized by another in-house PERL program. The intron phases in the WRKY domains were analyzed according to Xie et al. 32 To identify other domains in the OnWRKYs, MOTIF Search program ( http://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/ ) was used to search against the Pfam database with an E -value of <0.01. Other potential motifs of OnWRKYs, like MAPK phosphorylation sites, were identified based on previous publications. 28–302.6. Genomic and RNA sequencing data of O.nivara RNA sequencing data for the shoots and roots of the 30-day-old plants, respectively, panicles at the booting stage, and flag leaves at the booting stage of O.nivara were downloaded from SRA (accession number SRR1722159-62). 51 The O.nivara genome sequence was downloaded from the EnsemblPlants website. 52 Short reads were aligned and expression analysis was performed using the Tophat and Cufflinks software. 53,543. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of OnWRKY genes HMM analyses led to identification of 127 putative OnWRKY genes in O.nivara . Among them seven (01G13710.1, 03G01380.1, 03G36380.2, 04G06040.1, 05G21470.1, 11G15870.1, and 11G15890.1) do not have a WRKY domain-coding sequence, and hence were excluded from further analyses. 03G29220.1 and 03G30350.1 contain a WKKY and WRMC motif, respectively, and were counted as OnWRKYs. For a gene with several alternative transcripts, the transcript with the longest protein sequence was used for that locus, leading to elimination of 23 alternative transcripts. Overall, 97 genes were identified, named OnWRKY1 to OnWRKY125 corresponding to the names of their orthologues in O.sativa . The details of these OnWRKYs , such as their locus numbers, types of the encoded WRKY domains and sizes of the deduced peptides, are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . The lengths of the OnWRKYs range from 149 to 1,389 amino acids. The MSU and RAP gene IDs of the O.sativa ssp. japonica orthologs can also be found in the table. 3.2.  Expression analysis of OnWRKY genes based on the RNA-seq data Publically available RNA-seq data were derived from the shoots and roots of 30-day-old plants, respectively, and flag leaves and panicles at the booting stage, respectively. Overall, the OnWRKY expression levels were lowest in the panicle, followed by the flag leaf, shoot, and root ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Most OnWRKY genes showed some level of expression in at least one tissue. The panicle data were used to determine a baseline of expression because it had the lowest average expression level of all the plant tissues. Since >95% of the OnWRKY genes had an expression level of <50 reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) in the panicle, 50 RPKM was used as the baseline for expression. Genes with at least 50 RPKM in at least one tissue were depicted in Fig. 1 . The OnWRKY genes were sorted from low expression to high expression based on the root data because the average OnWRKY gene expression level in root was the highest. As can be seen in Fig 1 , there are many genes that have peak expression levels in different tissues. The gene with the highest expression was OnWRKY95 , with an expression level of 414 RPKM in the flag leaf; its expression levels in other tissues were <40 RPKM. The gene with the next highest peak expression was OnWRKY71 , which had an expression level of 231 RPKM in the root tissue. All other tissues had an OnWRKY71 expression level <60 RPKM. OnWRKY45 had the highest level of expression (119 RPKM) in the shoot, and <60 RPKM in all other tissues. OnWRKY13 had a high expression level (>80 RPKM) in three of the plant tissues excluding the panicle.  The highest expression of OnWRKY genes was generally detected in the root. Only genes that had an expression level of at least 50 RPKM in at least one tissue were plotted. The root and shoot samples came from 30-day-old plants and the panicles and flag leaves were from plants at the booting stage. The OnWRKY genes along the X-axis were sorted in ascending order of expression in the root tissue.  The highest expression of OnWRKY genes was generally detected in the root. Only genes that had an expression level of at least 50 RPKM in at least one tissue were plotted. The root and shoot samples came from 30-day-old plants and the panicles and flag leaves were from plants at the booting stage. The OnWRKY genes along the X-axis were sorted in ascending order of expression in the root tissue. 3.3. Classification of the OnWRKY genes The OnWRKY genes were classified into different groups and subgroups according to published methods. 8,32 Subgroups Ia and IIe each contain 11 genes, and IIb and IId each contain 7 genes ( Fig. 2 ). Subgroup Ib is the smallest group, with only two genes. The largest OnWRKY group is Group III, containing 28 genes. Subgroup IIc contains 22 genes. Five OnWRKY proteins contain incomplete WRKY domains and thus belong to group IV, of which four (OnWRKY22, 26, 27, and 119) could be classified into the other subgroups (subgroups IIb, IIc, and group III) based on their zinc finger structure, and one, OnWRKY56, does not have a complete zinc finger structure and is not able to be classified into any other group.  Group III is the largest group of OnWRKY genes. The distribution of the WRKY genes based on group or subgroup.  Group III is the largest group of OnWRKY genes. The distribution of the WRKY genes based on group or subgroup. 3.4. Chromosomal distribution of OnWRKY genes The O.nivara genome is an AA genome with 12 chromosomes. The number of OnWRKY genes on each chromosome varies ( Fig. 3 ). Chromosome 1 has the most number of OnWRKY genes (23 genes), followed by chromosomes 5 and 11 (15 and 11 genes, respectively) ( Fig. 4 ). Chromosome 10 has only three OnWRKY genes. The distribution of the OnWRKY genes on each chromosome is uneven. Some OnWRKY genes are clustered on chromosomes 1, 5, and 11, and some are scattered on chromosomes 2 and 6. The clustered sequences may have resulted from gene duplication events. The distribution density of OnWRKY genes on the chromosomes was then measured by gene number per million base pairs. As expected, the densities of OnWRKY genes on chromosomes 1, 5, and 11 are the highest ( Fig. 4 ).  Distribution of OnWRKY genes on the O. nivara chromosomes is uneven. The vertical columns represent chromosomes with the gene names shown on the right. The unit on the ruler is 100 kbp. The chromosome sizes were reduced by a factor of 10 5 . The colour codes for genes are: blue, subgroups Ia; light green, Ib; light purple, IIa; purple, IIb; light blue, IIc; pink, IId; orange, IIe and green, III.

The colour codes for genes are: blue, subgroups Ia; light green, Ib; light purple, IIa; purple, IIb; light blue, IIc; pink, IId; orange, IIe and green, III.  Chromosome 1 contains the largest number of OnWRKY genes, but shares the highest gene density with chromosome 5. The gene density was defined as gene number per million base pairs.  Chromosome 1 contains the largest number of OnWRKY genes, but shares the highest gene density with chromosome 5. The gene density was defined as gene number per million base pairs.  The distribution of OnWRKY genes on the chromosomes varies from group to group ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Subgroup IIc was the most widespread group, found on 11 chromosomes. Group III and subgroup Ia were found on 10 and 8 chromosomes, respectively. They are followed by subgroup IIe and IId, located on seven and five chromosomes, respectively. Subgroups IIa and IIb were each found on three chromosomes. 3.5. Comparison of OnWRKY gene clusters to OsWRKY gene clusters From visual inspection of the locations of the OnWRKY genes, it can be seen that there are regions where the density of OnWRKY genes is quite high. These regions will be referred to as “clusters” of WRKY genes. There are three clusters that stand out, cluster 1 on chromosome 1 (Chr1:34,313,705–34,621,563), cluster 2 on chromosome 5 (Chr5:21,272,296–21,492,695), and cluster 3 on chromosome 11 (Chr11:653,019–852,319) ( Fig. 3 ). All three of these regions are <400,000 bp in length and contain at least four OnWRKY genes.  To determine whether these WRKY gene clusters are conserved, the position of WRKY genes on O.nivara were compared with those on O.sativa ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Cluster 1 on O.nivara contained a similar corresponding region on chromosome 1 (Chr1:34,981,468–35,347,976) of O.sativa with the same six homologous WRKY genes ( WRKY22, 116, 20, 108, 21 , and 24 ) in the same order. Four of these WRKY genes belong to group III.  Cluster 2 on O.nivara also contained a similar corresponding region on chromosome 5 (Chr5:23,310,474–23,550,612) of O.sativa with the same four homologous WRKY genes ( WRKY70, 48, 84 , and 54 ) in the same order. Three of these WRKY genes belong to group III.  Cluster 3 on O.nivara contained a similar corresponding region on chromosome 11 (Chr11:749,998–793,116) of O.sativa , however, there were fewer OsWRKY genes. O.nivara contained seven WRKY genes ( WRKY52, 46, 95, 64, 50, 104 , and 40 ), six of which belong to group III, while O.sativa contained only five WRKY genes ( WRKY52, 46, 104, 40 , and 50 ). The order of the WRKY genes was also not consistent when comparing the last three OnWRKY genes to the OsWRKY genes. OsWRKY95 and 64 were missing from the cluster and were located in a different cluster on chromosome 12. Oryza sativa contains a cluster of WRKY genes that does not exist in O.nivara . The region Chr12:789,403–836,516 (cluster 4) on O.sativa contains five OsWRKY genes ( WRKY114, 97, 95, 64 , and 65 ). All of these are group III WRKY genes. O.nivara only has one WRKY gene in the corresponding location and that is OnWRKY114 . O.nivara does not contain OnWRKY97 or OnWRKY65 .  Most of the WRKY genes within the above-mentioned clusters are group III, the largest group of WRKY genes. This supports previous suggestions that group III WRKY genes expand more quickly than other WRKY genes. 7 The close similarity of the first three clusters validates O.nivara as a progenitor of O.sativa . The O.sativa cluster 4 developed later during the evolution of O.sativa . One possibility is that a gene relocation event occurred by which OsWRKY95 and 64 relocated from chromosome 11 to chromosome 12. These genes are very closely spaced with about 1,300 bp between them making this a plausible possibility. After the relocation event, these genes replicated to form the other nearby group III WRKY genes OsWRKY97 and 65 resulting in a new cluster. This is validated by the fact that O.nivara does not have a corresponding OnWRKY97 or OnWRKY65 . However, the fact the O.nivara contains OnWRKY114 on chromosome 12 in a similar location suggests that OsWRKY114 was already present on chromosome 12. Maybe the relocation of OsWRKY95 and 64 just happened to land near OsWRKY114 . Further research of this phenomenon is necessary to determine the exact sequence of events. 3.6. Structures of OnWRKY genes The number of exons and introns in the OnWRKY genes varies from 1 to 20 ( Fig. 5 ), with 47 OnWRKY genes (48%) containing 3 exons. About 88% of OnWRKY genes contain two to six exons. Three OnWRKY genes contain 1 exon and one contains 20 exons. Interestingly, although three exon genes are most common, all of group I OnWRKY genes contain more than three exons.  Most of OnWRKY genes contain two to six exons. The distribution of exon number of the WRKY genes ranges from 1 to 20 with three exon genes being the most abundant.  Most of OnWRKY genes contain two to six exons. The distribution of exon number of the WRKY genes ranges from 1 to 20 with three exon genes being the most abundant.  The OnWRKY transcripts structures were generated for visualization of the exons, introns, and positions of the WRKY and zing finger motifs ( Fig. 6 ). 50 Analyses of introns within the sequences encoding the WRKY domains support the group classification. The DNA sequences encoding C-terminal WRKY domains of the subgroup Ia OnWRKY genes contain PR type introns, which are inserted in the codon of an arginine residue in the WRKY domain ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), 8,32,55 but no N-terminal WRKY domains contain PR type introns. This suggests that the current N-terminal WRKY domains might not be direct duplications of the C-terminal WRKY domains. On the contrary, regions encoding both C-terminal and N-terminal WRKY domains of subgroup Ib genes have PR type introns. The PR type intron also occurs in the sequences encoding WRKY domains of subgroups IIc, IId, IIe, and III OnWRKY genes.  The exon-intron structures of OnWRKY genes.

Our previous work assigned introns inserted between two codons as phase 0, those between the first and second nucleotides of a codon as phase 1, and those between the second and third nucleotides of a codon as phase 2. All PR type introns are phase 2 except OnWRKY58 , which is phase 1. The VQR type introns (introns located directly before the codon of the valine residue in the WRKY domain) were observed in the sequences encoding WRKY domains in subgroups IIa and IIb genes. The VQR type introns all are phase 0. Sixteen WRKY domains harbour neither of the two types of introns. This reflects the complex evolution of OnWRKY genes. 3.7. Motif and domain analyses of OnWRKY proteins Most OnWRKY proteins have a conserved “WRKY” motif, but some had a variant motif such as WKKY, WVKY, and WRMC. The sequence W(R/K)(K/R)Y was recommended as the consensus sequence for the WRKY motif. 32 The question remains whether the WRMC or WVKY motifs can function as WRKY motifs. For example, the OnWRKY proteins (OnWRKY106 and -125) have variant WRKY motifs WRMC and WVKY, respectively, but also contain the conserved zinc finger motifs. Similarly, the heptamer WRKYGQK is present in the WRKY domain of 82% of OnWRKY proteins. Other variants such as WRKYGKK (OnWRKY7, -10, -26, -67, and -77), WKKYGQK (OnWRKY60), and WRMCGQK (OnWRKY106) were found in subgroup IIc OnWRKY proteins. WRKYGEK is found in six group III OnWRKY proteins (OnWRKY18, -46, -52, -55, -84, and -114). WRKYGLK and WVKYGQK were exclusively found in the subgroup Ib OnWRKY125 protein. The motif WRKYGKK was reported having lost the ability of binding to the W-box in soybean. 56WRKY genes mediate plant responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses. 57 Determination of conserved domains on OnWRKYs could help elucidate their functions. Extra domains were found in OnWRKY proteins by using the MOTIF Search program ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Subgroup Ib OnWRKY125, the longest OnWRKY protein with 1,389 amino acids, contains 2 WRKY domains and all motifs listed in Supplementary Table S4 except FAR1, FLYWCH, Plant_zn_clust and Mito_fiss_reg. Interestingly, OnWRKY125 also contains an NB-ARC domain (with an E -value of 2.4 × 10 -5 ). The genes that contain both NB-ARC and WRKY domain coding sequences were classified as RWRKY genes by Rinerson et al. 55 Two RWRKY genes ( OsjRWRKY1 and 2 ) were found in O. sativa subs japonica and one ( OsiRWRKY1 ) in O. sativa subs indica . 55 Protein BLAST queries of these three OsWRKYs against the deduced peptide sequences of O. nivara identified OnWRKY125 and ONIVA11g15890 as potential RWRKY genes. Upon examination of the protein sequence of ONIVA11g15890 , no WRKY domain was identified and though it does contain an NB-ARC domain, it cannot be classified as a RWRKY gene. NB-ARC domains have also been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana , Fragaria vesca , Glycine max , Sorghum bicolor , Setaria italic , and Theobroma cacao . 55 The NB-ARC functions as a signalling domain for plant resistance. 58–60 Presence of the AAA+ domains suggest that the function of OnWRKY125 might be ATP dependent. 61 The Thymidylate_kin domain in OnWRKY125 implies its role in regulating the cell cycle. 62 FLYWCH zinc finger domains were found in subgroup IId OnWRKY6 and group III OnWRKY22, -82, and -95. The FLYWCH domain was first discovered in Drosophila and plays a putative role in protein–protein interactions. 63 Another domain Plant–zn–clust 59 only occurs in subgroup IId OnWRKYs with E -values ranging from 10 -11 to 10 -20 , suggesting the special function of subgroup IId OnWRKYs. FAR1 domains were found in subgroup IIc OnWRKY7 and -67. The FAR1 domain is involved in the phyA-signalling pathway. 64,65 It suggests that OnWRKY67 function in the phytochrome signalling pathway. Mito_fiss_reg domain is presence in subgroup IIa OnWRKY71, which is related to mitochondrial fission. 66,67,OsWRKY71 was reported to function in signalling pathway in aleurone cells, 11,32 and the OsWRKY subgroup IIa transcription factors also have been shown to modulate rice innate immunity. 68 Mito_fiss_reg domain may help to explore its functional mechanism. This information could help elucidate the function and evolutionary relationships of these OnWRKY genes.  MAPK phosphorylation is involved in rice resistance to pathogens. 69 Several WRKYs have been reported to be phosphorylated by MAPKs in tobacco, Arabidopsis and rice. 70–74 MAPK phosphorylation sites usually contain some signature motifs. 28–30 Potential MAPK phosphorylation sites in OnWRKY proteins were analysed. About 90% of OnWRKYs contain at least one putative MAPK phosphorylation sites ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The maximum number of putative phosphorylation sites in one protein is 9 (in OnWRKY35). Ten OnWRKY proteins contain no phosphorylation sites, of which seven OnWRKY proteins belong to subgroup IIc. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation might be a popular regulation process for OnWRKY genes.  The substrate motif that interacts with MAPK is called the docking motif (D-motif, D-site, and D-domain). 30,75,76 For MAPKs, substrate specificity is ensured through the use of the D-motif. About 65.5% of the OnWRKY proteins with phosphorylation sites contain one to nine putative D-motifs. Another type of docking motif was reported as the F-site, 76,77 which was not found in OnWRKYs. Forty OnWRKYs do not contain any type of docking motifs, among which six OnWRKYs do not contain phosphorylation sites. These OnWRKYs might contain other types of docking motifs. Abundant MAPK phosphorylation sites found in OnWRKYs indicate that most OnWRKYs could be regulated by MAPK. 3.8. Phylogenetic analysis of the OnWRKY domains The phylogenetic relationship between the OnWRKY domains was examined by using MEGA6.0 for the multiple sequence alignment of all OnWRKY domains with bootstrap analyses. Similar to what was found in other plants, 8,32 OnWRKYs clustered into different clades of the NJ tree ( Fig. 7 ). The N-terminal domains of subgroup Ia OnWRKYs clustered into clade IaN and C-terminal domains of subgroup Ia were clustered into another clade (IaC). Group II diverged into four clades, of which subgroups IIa and IIb clustered into one clade, subgroups IId and IIe clustered into another, and subgroup IIc clustered into two clades, IIc1 and IIc2 ( Fig. 7 ). Our results supported the previous proposal to merge the subgroups IIa and IIb into a single subgroup, as well as subgroups IId and IIe into a single subgroup. 32 Most of the subgroup IIc OnWRKY genes clustered into the IIc1 clade that neighbours the IaC clade. The IIc1 clade was not strongly supported by bootstrapping. Two group IIc OnWRKY domains (OnWRKY53.2 and -90) clustered within the IaC clade and another two (OnWRKY57 and -106) within the IaN clade, which demonstrates a close evolutionary relationship between the subgroup IIc and subgroup Ia genes. The domains of three subgroup IIc OnWRKYs (17, -60, and -119) clustered into the IIc2 clade. This suggests a paralytic evolution of subgroup IIc domains. The WRKY domains of Group III OnWRKYs were clustered into one clade that includes the WRKY domains of all subgroup Ib OnWRKYs, which is strongly supported by a high bootstrap value (80). Group IV OnWRKYs were scattered amongst the different clades. The group IV OnWRKY56 fell just outside of clade IId + e, suggesting it possibly belongs to this subgroup. In brief, all clades are supported by high bootstrap values (=60), except for subgroup IIc. Phylogenetic analyses of the WRKY domains of OnWRKYs. The sequences were aligned by MUSCLE in the MEGA6 using the default parameters. The consensus NJ_tree was shown with the results of 1,000 bootstrap replications.

Phylogenetic analysis of full-length OnWRKY proteins The phylogenetic tree made from just the WRKY domains may miss important information on the evolution of OnWRKY genes. Hence, an NJ phylogenetic tree was generated using the full-length OnWRKY proteins. As shown in Fig. 8 , the full-length phylogenetic tree is similar to the domain tree ( Fig. 7 ). The subgroup Ia is clustered into one clade except for OnWRKY4, and subgroups IIa + b, IId + e, and III + Ib each clustered into one clade. Subgroup IIc diverged into three clades, IIc1, IIc2, and IIc3. The largest is the IIc1 clade, which neighbours clade Ia, but the other two clades of subgroup IIc (IIc2 and IIc3) were located in between clades IIa + b and IId + e. However, only clades Ia and IIa + b are supported by higher bootstrap values (=60). This neighbour joining tree is further supported by a maximum likelihood tree ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ).

Group Ia, diamond; Group Ib, filled triangle; Group IIa, circle; Group IIb, filled circle; Group IIc, filled diamond; Group IId, filled square; group IIe, square; group III, Triangle; Group IV: star. The differences between these two trees are mainly on subgroups Ia and IIc. In the domain tree, the WRKY domains of the subgroup Ia OnWRKY4 were clustered in the IaN and IaC clades, respectively. In the full protein sequence domain tree, OnWRKY4, was found in the IIc3 clade. Also, in the domain tree, among the 22 group IIc proteins, OnWRKY53.2 and -90 were found in the IaC clade, and OnWRKY57 and -106 in the IaN clade ( Fig. 7 ). In the full protein sequence tree, OnWRKY53.2 and -90 were similarly clustered into the subgroup Ia clade. However, OnWRKY57 and -106 were clustered into IIc3. 3.10. Promoter analysis of OnWRKY genes WRKY genes regulate plant responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses that are mediated by several plant hormones. 57 Analyses of the OnWRKY promoters help predict which OnWRKY genes could be responsive to these hormones and stresses. The promoter regions of the OnWRKY genes were extracted and queried for known DNA cis -acting motifs involved in the plant stress responses to ABA, SA, and drought. These included the ABA responsive element (ABRE), and its coupling elements (CE1 or CE3), 78 drought response element, 79 SA response element, 80 and the WRKY binding motif (W-box). 9 Several elements were found on nearly every promoter region with the SA element being the most abundant ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ).  The promoters of OnWRKY genes can be divided into six categories ( Supplementary Table S5 ) based on the number and type of cis -acting elements. Considering these cis -acting elements in the OnWRKY promoters, 68 OnWRKY genes could be induced by SA and response to the various stresses. Six OnWRKY genes could be regulated by OnWRKY genes. Because ABRE needs to couple with a CE, another copy of ABRE, or DRE to confer ABA response, 78,81 11 OnWRKY genes might be responsive to ABA, including 6 category 2 OnWRKY genes ( OnWRKY 1, 21, 22, 43, 49, and 125), 4 category 4 genes ( OnWRKY 79, 119, 53.1, and 58) and the sole category 5 gene ( Supplementary Table S5 ). One gene, OnWRKY1 , contains all elements above, and could response to ABA, SA, drought, and be regulated by WRKY genes. 3.11. Discussion The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families. They are involved in a wide variety of functions including plant development, stress response, senescence, and seed dormancy and germination. They have been identified in all land plants and even green algae, slime mould and protozoa (for a detailed review, see Rushton et al. 9 ). Although many WRKY genes have been studied in cultivated rice ( O.sativa ), the WRKY genes in the wild rice species O.nivara , the direct progenitor of O.sativa , have not been studied. O.nivara shows abundant genetic diversity 38 and elite drought 39 and disease resistance 82 features. Thus, research on O.nivara may lead to the engineering of more robust cultivars of the modern cultivated O.sativa .  In this study, a total of 97 OnWRKY genes were identified by using an HMM model derived from the OsWRKY genes. The OnWRKY genes were classified based on the number of WRKY domains and features of the zinc finger motifs of WRKY domain sequences. 8,32 Although groups I, II, and III WRKYs have been well characterized in many plant species, group IV WRKYs are rarely reported. WKRY proteins that have an incomplete WRKY domain were classified as group IV, as previously reported by Xie et al. 32 Group IV was reevaluated in this study by comparing WRKY56 and -58 proteins in O.sativa ssp. Japonica and O.nivara , along with WRKY58 in O.sativa ssp. indica (OsiWRKY56 was not found). This comparison suggested that the WRKY56 and -58 genes in these species did lose a part of the WRKY domain ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), and was not due to mistakes in genome annotations. This also suggests that WRKY56 and -58 genes may have lost their function as WRKY transcription factors.  The diversification of the WRKY genes into four groups resulted from a long evolution history. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how WRKY genes evolved. Hypothesis 1 stated that subgroup Ia was the ancestor of other WRKY genes. 2,32,42,48 Hypothesis 2 proposed that subgroup Ia and IIc have a common ancestor, IIc-like genes, and other WRKY group genes evolved from subgroup Ia. 48 Hypothesis 3 gave two alternative possibilities for the evolution of WRKY genes—the “Group I Hypothesis” suggested that group Ia WRKY genes are the most primitive and all other WRKY genes are derived from the C-terminal domain of the group Ia WRKY genes; the “IIa + b Separate Hypothesis” stated that group IIa + b WRKY genes evolved directly from the single WRKY domain of the ancestral algae WRKY genes, differing from the group I-derived lineage. 55 All hypotheses could explain the evolution of OnWRKYs, but only partially. Herein, we proposed an overall model of OsWRKY gene evolution based on the phylogenetic trees and the sequences with the WRKY domains ( Fig. 9 ). An ancient IIc WRKY gene is the ancestor of all WRKY genes. Group IIc WRKY genes are most diverse. Phylogenetic analyses of OnWRKY domains show that the subgroup IIc domains were clustered into two clades ( Fig. 7 ). However, the bootstrap values for clade IIc1 and IIc2 were extremely low (<20). Furthermore, the topology of the full protein sequence tree is similar to that of the domain tree regarding most clades. But subgroup IIc OnWRKYs were clustered into three separate clades in the full protein sequence tree, indicating they are paraphyletic.  Hypothesis on OnWRKY gene evolution. Ancient IIc WRKY genes were the ancestors of all WRKY genes. The ancient IIc WRKY proteins contain CX 4 C and HXH sites like modern subgroup IIc, but might contain more diversified sequences immediately following the CX 4 C motif. Subgroups Ia, IIb, IIc, IId, and III evolved directly from the ancient IIc WRKY genes. Some of the modern subgroup IIc WRKY genes evolved directly from the ancient IIc WRKY genes, but most IIc WRKY genes evolved from the subgroup Ia WRKY genes. The subgroup IIa WRKY genes evolved from subgroup IIb WRKY genes, subgroup IIe from subgroup IId, and subgroup Ib from group III. Group IV genes evolved from various other groups or subgroups by losing part of their WRKY domains. Solid thick arrow: strong evidence; solid thin arrows: some evidence; dash arrow: hypothetical scheme or groups.  Hypothesis on OnWRKY gene evolution. Ancient IIc WRKY genes were the ancestors of all WRKY genes.

Subgroups Ia, IIb, IIc, IId, and III evolved directly from the ancient IIc WRKY genes. Some of the modern subgroup IIc WRKY genes evolved directly from the ancient IIc WRKY genes, but most IIc WRKY genes evolved from the subgroup Ia WRKY genes. The subgroup IIa WRKY genes evolved from subgroup IIb WRKY genes, subgroup IIe from subgroup IId, and subgroup Ib from group III. Group IV genes evolved from various other groups or subgroups by losing part of their WRKY domains. Solid thick arrow: strong evidence; solid thin arrows: some evidence; dash arrow: hypothetical scheme or groups.  It is generally believed that group IIc WRKYs evolved from group Ia WRKYs. 2,32,48 Some of our data support this hypothesis. First, the C-terminal WRKY domains of group Ia proteins are very similar to the subgroup IIc proteins ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). They are all the same length and many of the amino acids align identically. Most IIc WRKYs have a PR intron (20/23) and all group Ia C-terminal WRKY domains have a PR intron (11/11). Second, subgroup IIc OnWRKY53.2 and -90 WRKY domains were clustered into the IaC clade in the domain tree and the Ia clade in the full protein tree ( Figs. 7 and 8 ). This suggests that OnWRKY53.2 and -90 may have derived from subgroup Ia by losing N-terminal WRKY domains. However, there is some evidence that contradicts this hypothesis. Most of the subgroup IIc WRKY proteins in clade IIc1 contain a KVE or RVE sequence in their zinc finger motifs. Most group IaC WRKYs contain an HVE sequence in their zinc finger. The exceptions are subgroup IIc OnWRKY53.2 and -90 which contain the HVE sequence ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This HVE sequence may be the reason they cluster with group IaC in the phylogenetic tree. The close relationship between subgroup IIc1 and group Ia may indicate that group Ia evolved from group IIc1. It may be the case that OnWRKY53.2 and -90 evolved from modern subgroup Ia WRKYs.  The case regarding OnWRKY57 and -106 is more complicated. Based on the domain tree, these two proteins cluster with clade IaN. However, based on the full protein sequence tree, it appears that they may have evolved from an ancient IIc protein ( Fig. 9 ). This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that among all IIc proteins in the IaN clade ( Fig. 7 ), OnWRKY57 and -106 do not contain PR-type introns in the coding regions for the WRKY domains ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ).  Given the data observed, we hypothesize that an ancient subgroup IIc WRKY gene was the original progenitor of WRKY genes ( Fig. 9 ). Previous hypotheses state that group III WRKYs evolved from subgroup Ia and IId, 48,55 However, we hypothesize that Group III OnWRKYs diverged first from ancient subgroup IIc based on phylogenetic analyses. Analyses of a moss and a green alga also support this hypothesis. Group III WRKYs in the moss Physcomitrella patens83 and the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus84 share the same CX 4 C pattern in their C 2 H 2 zinc finger motifs with subgroup IIc WRKYs in O.nivara and all other WRKY -gene containing organisms. If group III WRKYs were derived from subgroup Ia, then subgroup Ia WRKYs would have contained C 2 HC zinc fingers. However, all known group Ia WRKYs contain two C 2 H 2 zinc fingers and all group III WRKYs contain C 2 HC zing fingers. We also think that it is unlikely that group III WRKY genes evolved from group IId because the alga O.lucimarinus contains only two WRKY genes, belonging to subgroup IIc and group III, respectively. 84,85 However, the oldest group IId gene was found in the moss, P.patens. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, subgroups Ia, IIb, and IId may also have evolved from ancient IIc WRKY genes. Group IV WRKY genes could be derived from any other groups of WRKY genes by losing part of a WRKY domain ( Fig. 9 ). Further research is necessary to verify their evolutionary relationships. WRKY genes expanded and diversified in the evolutional process from green algae to land plants, expanded and diversified more rapidly in seed plants. 42,55 Green algae usually contain just a few WRKY genes, but angiosperm plants often contain more than 100 WRKY genes. The published WRKY profiles showed that Subgroup IIc WRKY genes expanded more rapidly in dicots and group III WRKY genes expanded more rapidly in monocots. 7 The mechanism by which the number of WRKY genes within a species expanded is interesting. Segmental and tandem gene duplication plays an important role in Arabidopsis. 86 Tandem gene duplication was also reported in Brachypodium distachyon. 6 Similar WRKY gene arrangements were found in O.nivara . In total, 17 OnWRKY genes were considered as tandem duplication genes in three clusters on chromosomes 1, 5, and 11 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Further research demonstrated that clusters 1–3 are the same as those in O.sativa ssp. japonica , which has a fourth cluster that was not found in O.nivara and appears to be derived from cluster 3. Interestingly, most of these tandem duplication WRKY genes belong to group III, suggesting group III WRKY genes possibly expanded mainly by gene tandem duplication in rice.  The expanded and diversified WRKY genes are involved in responding to various stresses and in various developmental processes in plant. 9,10,12,13,16,17,26,27,42 The analysis of the cis -acting elements in the OnWRKY promoters show that 68 OnWRKY genes might be responsive to SA, with 35 genes of them also to ABA and drought. It was reported that OsWRKY13 , -31 , -45 , -53 , -71 , and -89 responded to various pathogenic fungi. 10 All promoters of their orthologues in OnWRKYs contain SARE implying they have similar functions. RNA-sequencing experiments need to be conducted to address the regulation of the OnWRKY genes by plant hormones and their expression profiles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. These data will help elucidate the functions of OnWRKY genes and the evolutionary scheme of their promoters.  In summary, we have identified 97 OnWRKY genes in the wild rice O.nivara . The OnWRKYs were classified into four groups based on the number of WRKY motifs and features of the zinc finger motifs. Our results demonstrate that group IV WRKY genes are not due to incorrect annotations of the genomes, but rather they reflect the evolution of WRKY genes. Expression analysis via RNA-seq shows that though many OnWRKY genes were expressed in all tested samples, expression was the lowest in panicles and highest in the roots. About 90% OnWRKY proteins contain potential MAPK phosphorylation sites, suggesting that the functions of most OnWRKYs are regulated by phosphorylation. According to the phylogenetic analyses, we hypothesize that ancient subgroup IIc WRKY genes were the ancestors of all WRKY genes. Though most of the modern subgroup IIc OnWRKY genes were derived from subgroup Ia, A few subgroup IIc OnWRKY genes and group III On WRKY genes evolved directly from ancient IIc WRKY genes. Tandem gene duplication events may account for the expansion mechanisms of some WRKY genes, especially for the group III WRKY genes, in monocot plants. Together this study provides a solid foundation to the investigation of the functions and evolution of OnWRKY genes.

In this study, we determined the nearly complete genome sequence of A. platensis YZ. A. platensis YZ genome is a single, circular chromosome of 6.62 Mb in size. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses revealed that A. platensis YZ was more closely related to A. platensis NIES-39 than Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1. Broad gene gains were identified between A. platensis YZ and three other Arthrospira speices, some of which have been previously demonstrated that can be laterally transferred among different species, such as restriction-modification systems-coding genes. Moreover, unprecedented extensive chromosomal rearrangements among different strains were observed. The chromosomal rearrangements, particularly the chromosomal inversions, were analysed and estimated to be closely related to palindromes that involved long inverted repeat sequences and the extensively distributed type IIR restriction enzyme in the Arthrospira genome. In addition, species from genus Arthrospira unanimously contained the highest rate of repetitive sequence compared with the other species of order Oscillatoriales , suggested that sequence duplication significantly contributed to Arthrospira genome phylogeny. These results provided in-depth views into the genomic phylogeny and structural variation of A. platensis , as well as provide a valuable resource for functional genomics studies. 1. Introduction Spirulina is a multi-cellular and filamentous blue-green microalga that has gained considerable popularity in the health food industry and increasingly as a protein and vitamin supplement. Spirulina taxonomically belongs to two separate genera, namely Spirulina and Arthrospira , and consists of about 15 species. 1,Arthrospira is the most common and widely available spirulina that has been extensively investigated in various health-related studies. 1 It is composed of closely related, genetically and physiologically distinct lineages whose differences enable them to adapt to specific ecological niches. Arthrospiraplatensis from Lake Chenghai is a well-known representative in China, and many previous studies associated with stress tolerance and gene functional characterization were regarding to this cyanobacterial strain. 2–5,Arthrospira also contains high amount of proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and photosynthetic pigments. Despite its highly useful applications, very little is known about the phylogeny, physiological and genetic system in A . platensis . Unlike other bacteria, the genome of microorganisms belonging to phylum Cyanobacterium generally possesses a large amount of dispersed repetitive sequences, particularly Arthrospira , thereby causing difficulty in the complete assembly of its genome. 6 In the past 6 years, several genomes from genus Arthrospira that belong to geographically distinct lineages have been nearly completely recovered by independent sequencing and assembly into single super-scaffolds, respectively, including A . platensis NIES-39, Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A . platensis C1. 6–8 Previous studies have generated on its genomic constitution, annotation, classification of respective isolates, as well as provided the first opportunity to reconstruct its phylogenetic relationship with other different strains. Nevertheless, there were no in-depth comparative genomics analyses revealing the molecular implications associated with genetic diversity affecting the evolutionary origin, and how these genetic differences generated among distinct lineages. In addition, considering the ubiquity of dispersed repeated sequences and its emerging role in genome evolution, we can hardly be said to comprehend Arthrospira genome without giving an account of what these repetitive sequences are, what they do and how they arise. Present study reports the nearly complete genome sequence of one cultivated strain, namely, A . platensis YZ. We then reconstructed the genomic evolution events involving this strain and compared the gene and genomic structure with those of closely related species to assess the phylogenetic relationship, genetic diversity and genomic structure variation. 2. Materials and methodsArthrospiraplatensis YZ was initially isolated from Chenghai Lake in Yunnan Province, China. The cyanobacterial strain was cultured under 0.02 M NaCl Zarrouk medium at 30 °C, light intensity of 8 kilolux and 75% humidity. After total DNA was extracted, two genomic shotgun libraries with 1.5- and 4.5-kb insert sizes were constructed described as previously. 9 A fosmid (pCC1FOS fosmid vector) library was constructed by using the CopyControl Fosmid library production kit (Epicentre), following the manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition, a 10-kb Illumina mate-pair library was also constructed as described elsewhere. 10 All libraries were sequenced from both ends. Reads that were derived from the two small-insert sized libraries were initially mixed and assembled by using the Phrap software. Consed was used in the finishing process. 11 Initially, the primary assembly generated a total of 2,294 contigs, many of which were determined to be mis-assembled. Then, the primary assembly was manually checked via assessment of the paired-end reads distances of the cloned libraries. The mis-assembled regions were disassembled, and local blocks were established for re-assembly. The Illumina and fosmid reads were mapped onto the assembly to scaffold the contigs. The contiguous relationships between all the contigs at non-repetitive regions were anchored by the Illumina mate-pair or fosmid paired-end reads. Gaps were closed by primer-walking on the PCR products from neighbour extremity of the linked contigs or corresponding fosmid clones. The Illumina reads were also employed to confirm and correct those with low-quality (but not repeated sequence) assembly regions by using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. 12 We used the Glimmer software to predict protein-coding genes with potential open reading frames of >150 bp in size. 13 RNAmmer and tRNAscan-SE were utilized to identify rRNA and tRNA genes, respectively. 14,15 Gview was used to construct basic genomic features. 16 BLASTX was used to annotate predicted protein-coding genes against the public protein database with an e -value threshold of 1e-5. Genome-wide identification of restriction-modification (RM) systems were conducted by using BLASTP searching against REbase with a >50% amino acid identity and >50% query coverage after all ORFs were theoretically translated. 17 Comparative analysis of RM enzymes between Arthrospira strains was performed by using BLASTP with an e-value threshold of 1e-20. We selected 31 partial or complete genomes of determined species from Oscillatoriales for phylogenetic analysis. A species tree was generated by concatenation of 27 of 31 conserved proteins as previously reported, 18 including dnaG , frr , nusA , pgk , pyrG , rplA , rplB , rplC , rplD , rplE , rplF , rplK , rplL , rplM , rplN , rplP , rplS , rpoB , rpsB , rpsC , rpsE , rpsI , rpsK , rpsM , rpsS , smpB , and tsf , because some species did not harbour all the genes due to various reasons. Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 from order Gloeobacterales was used as outgroup for rooting the tree. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated by using PhyML 3.0 with 1,000 bootstrap replications. 19 The protein-coding gene derived from four Arthrospira genomes was predicted using the same criteria as earlier described. Gview was used to construct general features that were subsequently employed in comparative analysis. In silico hybridization was performed using the BLASTP program, with an e -value threshold of 1e-5. Using A. platensis YZ as reference, gene order in the other three species was established accordingly, followed by the identification of potential laterally transferred genes (LTGs) by using a custom-derived script combined with a manual check. Insertion sequences were predicted by using IS finder. 20 Assessment of global genomic co-linearity relationships among species was performed by using the mauve software. 21 BLASTN was used to identify direct and inverted repeats (IRs) as well as palindromes. Given that all the theoretically predicted genes were protein-coding genes, genome-wide clustering of all genes was performed. Only those species from Oscillatoriales with relatively intact genome sequence (genome scaffolds of < 10) were selected for whole genome clustering analysis, including Lyngbya majuscula 3L, Geitlerinema sp. PCC 7105, Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 7376, Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 7375, Oscillatoria nigro-viridis PCC 7112, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC 6802, Oscillatoria sp. PCC 10802, Microcoleus sp. PCC 7113, Crinalium epipsammum PCC 9333, Oscillatoria acuminata PCC 6304, Leptolyngbya boryanar PCC 6306, Spirulina major PCC 6313, Oscillatoriales cyanobacterium JSC-12, Spirulina subsalsa PCC 9445, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC 7367, Geitlerinema sp. PCC 7407, and four strains from genus Arthrospira , because many genes were doomed to be undetermined in the incomplete genome assembly. All genome sequences were obtained from Integrated Microbial Genomes at DOE Joint Genome Institute or NCBI. Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) was used to perform gene clustering analysis with 50% alignment coverage for both sequences (-aL 0.5, -aS 0.5) at nine resolutions. 22 C/W ratio was calculated as the number of total clusters divided by the number of total genes. R/T ratio represented the number of redundant gene clusters (the clusters which comprised at least two genes) divided by the total number of clusters. Smaller C/W ratios indicated a higher level of gene redundancy, whereas larger R/T ratios suggested broader gene redundancy spectra. Tandem repeats (TRs) were identified by using TR Finder with the following parameters (2 7 7 80 10 100 2000 -f -d -m). 23 Clustering of repeat motifs was conducted by CD-HIT with both 100% identity and 100% query, and hit alignment coverage. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) Finder was used to identify CRISPR arrays. 24 The complete genome sequence of A. platensis YZ has been deposited to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession CP013008. 3. Results and Discussion3.1. General features of A. platensis YZ genome We selected one single cultivated cyanobacterial strain, which we designated as A . platensis YZ, for whole genome sequencing. Genomic DNA was sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy, which was conducted by using a ‘hybrid’ approach that combined Sanger and Illumina sequencing technologies. Four different libraries, including 1.5-, 4.5-, 40-kb insert-sizes clone libraries, and an Illumina mate-pair library with a 10-kb insert-size were constructed and sequenced. Over 130,000 high-quality Sanger reads (~8.9-fold genome coverage) and 10,434,858 Illumina reads (~77.2-fold genome coverage) were obtained. We assembled the A. platensis genome into one super-scaffold with terminal overlaps. Taken together, A. platensis has a single, circular chromosome of 6.62 Mb in size, with an average GC content of 44.2% ( Fig. 1 ). The current version of the A. platensis YZ genome contains 10 undetermined regions with a totally estimated gap size of 96 kb, and the remaining gaps apparently consist of TRs and Arthrospira -specific repeats. The genome size of A. platensis YZ is a little smaller than the previously sequenced A. platensis NIES-39 (6.79 Mb), 8 but larger than Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 (6.23 Mb) 7 and A. platensis C1 (6.09 Mb). 6 GC skew analysis to anchor potential origin and terminator for chromosome replication did not show obvious skew shift. This is different from those bacteria whose chromosomal replication origin and terminator could be clearly identified, 9,25 but is similar to other cyanobacterial genomes, suggesting the occurrence of potential chromosomal rearrangements, sequence duplications and lateral gene transfer (LGT) events, 26 because the bias of nucleotide compositions between leading and lagging strands were disrupted. In addition, mapping Illumina short reads back to the genome resulted in 99.6% of the total reads uniquely aligned to the assembly and 98.4% paired-end reads represented correct orientation and distance, which was indicative of the high credibility of the assembled genome.

Gaps were labelled with G1-G10.  The A. platensis YZ genome was predicted to harbour 6,784 protein-coding genes with average gene length of 795 bp. A total of 3,149 and 6,711 protein-coding genes can be annotated by known function or hypothetical protein in the UniProt/Swiss-Prot and non-redundant protein databases, respectively. Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins database annotation showed that a number of genes participated in its replication, recombination, and repair ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Moreover, the genome sequence was also predicted to contain two sets of rRNA genes and 39 tRNA genes that were predicted to translate 19 types of amino acids, except for lysine. The number of rRNA gene clusters in the A. platensis YZ genome is similar to that observed in A. platensis NIES-39, Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005, and A. platensis C1, whereas the number of tRNA genes differed from those of cynaobacteria (40, 42, and 39 tRNA, respectively). 3.2. Phylogenetic and comparative genomics analyses of Arthrospira Because Arthrospira belongs to order Oscillatoriales , a species tree was constructed for phylogenomic analysis by concatenating 27 conserved proteins coexisted in the 31 Oscillatoriales species ( Fig. 2 ). As expected, A. platensis YZ was clustered together with the other members of genus Arthrospira , which is highly congruent with the findings of previous study on whole cyanobacteria phylum phylogeny. 27 Subclade D of the tree showed that A. platensis YZ was phylogenetically closer to A. platensis str. Paraca and A. platensis NIES-39 than Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1, which was indicative of intimate intragenus relationship among A. platensis YZ, A. platensis str. Paraca, and A. platensis NIES-39.  A species tree from Oscillatoriales. Phylogenetic reconstruction of members of Oscillatoriales using the maximum-likelihood method was performed in the present study. Taxa are colour-coded according to the same genus. Nodes supported with a bootstrap of > 70% are indicated by black dots. Phylogenetic subclades are grouped into seven major subclades (A–G). A species tree from Oscillatoriales.

Nodes supported with a bootstrap of > 70% are indicated by black dots. Phylogenetic subclades are grouped into seven major subclades (A–G). Gene gains and losses have been considered as one of the most significant contributors to functional changes. 28 To further characterize the differences among several A. platensis genomes, we performed comparative genomics analysis of A. platensis YZ with three other species, including A. platensis NIES-39, Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1, whereas the complete genome of A. platensis str. Paraca is currently unavailable. 29 Extensive sequence gains were identified when using A. platensis YZ as backbone during its comparative analysis to the other three species. At least 20 apparently unique regions, excluding the undetermined sequence, were detected in the A. platensis YZ genome ( Fig. 3A ). More particular regions in the A. platensis NIES-39 genome were observed, which might be explained by its larger genome ( Fig. 3B ). However, the unique regions in Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1 were markedly reduced relative to that in A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39. Furthermore, in silico hybridization identified 100 A. platensis YZ-specific genes, of which 82 could not be annotated by the known proteins.  Comparative genomic analysis of four complete sequenced Arthrospira speices. A. platensis YZ (A) and A. platensis NIES-39 (B) were used as backbone (reference or hit) for the comparison to three query genomes, respectively. The genomes scaled to 100 kb. Counting from the outside toward the centre: red colour (slot 1) indicated that the nucleotide sequences were only detected in the reference genomes and undetermined gaps of the reference where query genomes were not mapped by ‘Ns’. Black arrow and R1-R5 in (A) indicate specific or unique regions in A. platensis YZ genome, and the regions R1-R5 were selected for analyses of gene gains in A . platensis YZ relative to other three genomes. G1-G10 in (A) and G1-G18 in (B) indicate 10 and 18 undetermined gaps in A . platensis YZ and A . platensis NIES-39 genome, respectively. Slots 2-5 showed that the corresponding query regions had higher sequence similarity (=70%) with the reference sequence. Empty regions on the query slots indicated parts without similar hits between the backbone sequence and the query sequences, and those undetermined bases in the reference genomes. The last two circles respectively indicate the GC content and GC skew of the reference genomes. The Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 was abbreviated as A . sp. PCC 8005 in this and the following figures.

Empty regions on the query slots indicated parts without similar hits between the backbone sequence and the query sequences, and those undetermined bases in the reference genomes. The last two circles respectively indicate the GC content and GC skew of the reference genomes. The Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 was abbreviated as A . sp. PCC 8005 in this and the following figures.  The most powerful approach for identification of gene gains and losses is by conducting a direct molecular genetic analysis of DNA sequences. 30 We analysed several syntenic blocks with extensive gene gains in A. platensis YZ relative to the other three A . platensis genomes ( Fig. 4 ). These blocks involved addition of unknown functions and well characterized genes, which indicated the occurrence of potential LGT events. Scanning the upstream and downstream sequences surrounding these additional genes in A. platensis YZ did not identify known transposons or insertion elements. Furthermore, comparative analysis showed an additional 5-kb sequence that encoded five genes that were flanked by a pair of 170-bp direct repeats (DRs) with high similar sequence identity (>91%) that were inserted into the A. platensis YZ genome relative to that of the A. platensis NIES-39, as indicated in R1 ( Fig. 4 ). These potential LTGs included two ATPases that belonged to the AAA superfamily and three hypothetical proteins that were extensively distributed in the various Oscillatoriales species. Moreover, we did not identify typical IRs that flanked these genes, suggesting that the acquisition of these genes might have not been mediated by transposable elements, but was possibly mediated by recombinase through recombination where a pair of 170-bp DRs was presented. However, there was no known recombinase encoded by these genes, which in turn suggesting that this accessory region could have been lost from A. platensis NIES-39 by recombination between two DR sequences. Nucleotides composition analysis did not show obviously abnormal discrepancy of GC content between acquired and flanking regions. Potential LGT associated with acquisition of type I RM system was observed (R2). A complete RM system was acquired in A. platensis YZ relative to Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1. More complexity of nested DRs’ composition (DR1, DR2, and DR3) surrounding the acquired gene cluster in A. platensis YZ was identified at this area, whereas only DR3 sequence appeared as a single event in the whole genomes of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1. Supplementary Material S1 listed the three DRs appeared in the A. platensis YZ. Moreover, these nested DRs were sporadically scattered across the counterpart region in A. platensis NIES-39 but not throughout the genome, and showed an increased frequency of emergence compared with A. platensis YZ, suggestive of the high instability of this region. Interestingly, we also identified a cluster of probably non- Arthrospira -derived genes including methyltransferase (Y8219) encoding gene that are present in A. platensis YZ genome (R3). The Y8219 and the immediate downstream two function-unknown genes in A. platensis YZ shared only 51.0, 51.2, and 24.2% amino acid identities with the orthologues from Microcoleus vaginatus , Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and Pseudoalteromonas agarivorans , respectively, suggesting that these genes were more likely derived from distantly related organisms accompanied by extensive mutations, because two of these three genes had no orthologues in recently sequenced Arthrospira genome at all. The genomic structure in this area among four strains is also largely different, which indicated high variability of this region. In addition, potential LGT between closely related organisms was also observed. Three genes from Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 that were inserted into the A. platensis NIES-39 backbone resembled the local genomic structure of A. platensis YZ (R4, Fig. 4 ). Finally, LGT potentially mediated by mobile genetic element (MGE) was also identified in A. platensis YZ genome relative to that observed in A. platensis NIES-39 (R5, Fig. 4 ). A reverse transcriptase (RTase)-encoding gene was immediately followed by a pair of long terminal repeats (LTRs, >90% identity), which was further globally enwrapped by a pair of long DRs (LDRs) (>85% identity) that leads to the formation of a typical retrotransposon. The retrotransposons consist of two subclasses, LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons, based on the phylogeny of RTase which they encodes. 31 Duplication of retrotransposons is a replicative event through transcribing themselves to RNA intermediate and then reversely transcribing back to DNA that has been demonstrated to be directed by RTase which is the key component of the retrotransposons. 32 However, its integration into the A. platensis genome seems to be a recombination event, because it is unreasonable to generate such LDRs by using transposase.  Five typical regions involved in potential LGT events in A. platensis YZ compared with three other Arthrospira species. R1-R5 corresponds to the R1-R5 in the Figure 3. Homologous genes are marked with same colour, whereas non-homologous genes are left blank. Gene-coding products were labelled with abbreviated names provided in the UniProt database, whereas unlabelled arrows indicate unannotated or unknown gene. (+) or (-) suggests the block is located on the non-complementary or complementary strand of the corresponding genome. R1: Five additional genes were gained in the A. platensis YZ genome. A pair of 170-bp sequence (DR) with >95% identity flanked the LTGs in A. platensis YZ, whereas only one copy was detected in A. platensis NIES-39, and entirely absent in Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1; R2: DR1 is 87-bp in length. DR2 and DR3 are parts of DR1. The genome of A. platensis NIES-39 in this region is rich in three types of DRs; R3: A 15-bp imperfect IR flanked the LTGs in Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 compared with that of A. platensis NIES-39. No DR or IR surrounding the LTG at this region was detected in the A. platensis YZ genome; R4: No DR flanking the LTG was detected in A. platensis YZ compared with that of A. platensis NIES-39; R5: IR and DR are 349- and 187-bp in size, respectively.

Gene-coding products were labelled with abbreviated names provided in the UniProt database, whereas unlabelled arrows indicate unannotated or unknown gene.

A pair of 170-bp sequence (DR) with >95% identity flanked the LTGs in A. platensis YZ, whereas only one copy was detected in A. platensis NIES-39, and entirely absent in Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1; R2: DR1 is 87-bp in length. DR2 and DR3 are parts of DR1. The genome of A. platensis NIES-39 in this region is rich in three types of DRs; R3: A 15-bp imperfect IR flanked the LTGs in Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 compared with that of A. platensis NIES-39. No DR or IR surrounding the LTG at this region was detected in the A. platensis YZ genome; R4: No DR flanking the LTG was detected in A. platensis YZ compared with that of A. platensis NIES-39; R5: IR and DR are 349- and 187-bp in size, respectively.  In some eubacteria and archaea, such as Acinetobacter baumannii , Escherichia coli , Enterococcus faecium , Lactococcus lactis , and Mycobacterium smegmatis , transposon-mediated LGT usually generates a pair of DRs varying from several to a dozen base pairs flanking the foreign gene after its integration into the host genome. 33–36 Interestingly, the size of DRs in the A. platensis was significantly longer than those of other species. For instance, a 170-bp sequence was only observed in the A. platensis NIES-39 genome, where it duplicated only once and thus generated a DR that flanked the acquired genes in the A. platensis YZ (R1, Fig. 4 ). Likewise, distributions of the 87-bp DR and its’ nested copies were strictly restricted to the neighbouring region of the type I RM system gene cluster, but not ubiquitously in the genome (R2, Fig. 4 ). LGT involved in the RM systems has been widely observed, including insert element-, 37 phage- 38 , and integrative element-mediated transfer. 39 Previous bacterial pan-genome statistical analysis suggested that solitary RM genes were most likely to be transferred by large MGEs, whereas complete RM systems were more frequently transferred autonomously or in small MGEs. 40 However, there were no MGE involving in or flanking these acquired genes in R1 and R2. Therefore, it could not exclude that the formation of respective genomic architecture in the three other genomes underwent gene losses at the counterpart regions. The locally distributed DRs may indicate that these DRs were closely related to the gene gains or losses in R1 and R2. 3.3. Chromosomal rearrangements in Arthrospira Comparative analysis of the four Arthrospira strains showed that orthologous genes within the same block often possessed distinct coding orientations, which in turn was suggestive of the presence of chromosomal rearrangements. Comparison of global genomic synteny revealed that A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39 had strong co-linearity, whereas Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 was highly collinear with A. platensis C1 ( Fig. 5 ), which was consistent with the evolutionary relationship among these species. The observed co-linearity divided the four Arthrospira genomes into two groups. There were few structural variations within groups, except for a 350-kb fragment that was detected in situ to be inverted in orientation between Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1 (region A, Fig. 5 ). However, extensive chromosomal rearrangements were observed between the two groups, including inversion, translocation, deletion, as well as combinations of these events, suggesting that speciation between groups underwent multiple and extremely complicated structural variations that are very difficult to interpret. We analysed the sequences surrounding the inverted genomic fragment between Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1. Result showed that a pair of 11-kb long inverted repeats (LIRs) with >97% global sequence identities flanked and further extended into the inverted fragment, which resulted in an obscure boundary for the chromosomal inversion. Within the LIR, we identified five pairs of palindromes that constituted a series of restriction enzyme recognition sites (RERS). These molecular evidences suggested that the chromosomal inversion was probably initiated from the symmetrically distributed RERS of the internal region of the LIR and mediated by the restriction enzyme as previously proposed. 41,42 This LIR seems not to be occasionally emerged at the edge of this inverted fragment, but was closely related to this region to some extent, because it appeared only three times and twice throughout the genomes of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1, respectively. The 11-kb LIR encoded a tyrosine recombinase that belonged to the integrase family. 43,44 After a sequence replication event, fusion of the 11-kb copy into adjacent loci of genome might have resulted from the integrase-mediated site-specific recombination, which well explains the duplication events. In addition, the predicted protein-coding genes that harboured RERS that probably interacted with the restriction enzyme within the LIR apparently remained intact after the chromosomal inversion, because the sequence identities between LIR flanking the inverted genomic fragment were extremely high. Chromosomal rearrangements that were potentially associated with sequence duplication were also identified between two groups, such as Figure 5 regions B and C. We analysed the sequences that flanked potentially invertible genomic fragment (region B) between the two groups, and two RERS were identified within the LIR in A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39, albeit chromosomal inversion at this region was not recurrent among species in the same group. Five and seven copies of the intact 11.6-kb sequence were respectively detected in the genomes of A. platensis NIES-39 and A. platensis YZ. However, all the coding genes derived from the 11.6-kb LIR could not be annotated with known functions; therefore, its potential involvement in particular molecular function remains elusive. Likewise, a pair of 2-kb LIR flanking the potentially invertible genomic fragment was also identified in the region C. Therefore, generation of LIR, but not LDR, in the neighbouring region of genome via sequence duplication would not only enhance the frequency of occurrence of RERS and paired RERS, but also would not destroy gene order after chromosomal inversion. Taken together, the sequence duplication followed by the formation of LIRs flanking the genomic fragments, might play an important role in the chromosomal inversions in A. platensis .

The RM system, an important immune system for bacteria that prevents the uptake of exogenous DNA, is largely variable in terms of copy number and constitution. 45,46 It was also proposed to possess the potential role in chromosomal rearrangements, because they can cut DNA. 41 Genome-wide identification of RMs in the Oscillatoriales order revealed that species from Arthrospira harboured the most abundant RM enzymes ( Table 1 and Fig. 6 ). In the Arthrospira , four strains all contained types I and II RM enzymes, with type IIR enzymes predomination. Besides types I and II RM , Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1 both harboured a type III RM system, while it was absent in A. platensis NIES-39 and A. platensis YZ.  Overview of RM systems distributed in the four Arthrospira genomes.

Distribution of RM systems in Oscillatoriales order  Distribution of RM systems in Oscillatoriales order  Based on the whole genome co-linear relationship, we performed comparative analyses of RM systems intra- and inter-groups for four Arthrospira strains. As expected, the co-linearity of RM systems-coding genes within groups was consistent with the whole genomic synteny ( Fig. 6 ). Within the groups, besides those common RM systems, there were three unique enzymes in the A. platensis YZ genome compared with A. platensis NIES-39, including one type IIR, one type IM and one type IR enzyme, whereas only a type IS was uniquely existence in the A. platensis NIES-39 compared with A. platensis YZ. Likewise, seven (one type IR, one IS, three IIR, two IIM) and six (three type IS and three IIR) enzymes were uniquely presented to each other in A. platensis C1 and Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005, respectively. For inter-groups comparison, two (one IIR and one IIM) and three (two type IS and one IIR) enzymes were uniquely appeared in the A. platensis C1 and Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 response to the other strains, respectively, while no unique RM enzyme occurred in the A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39 genomes ( Fig. 6 ). Generally, the more unique RM gene relative to the smaller genome size was observed in these closely related strains, which may indicate the importance of RM systems for genome plasticity in the Arthrospira . The FASTA sequences of unique enzymes presented in each strain were listed in the Supplementary Material S2 .  Chromosomal inversions have been frequently identified in other closely related cyanobacterial strains. For instance, an inverted 1.3-Mb fragment was detected between Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 and PCC 8802, and a 188-kb inversion was identified between Synechococcus elongates PCC 6301 and PCC 7942 chromosome. 47,48 However, these authors did not provide possible suggestions underlying the generation of the chromosomal inversion. Indeed, the 1.3-Mb inverted fragment was flanked by a pair of 5.2-kb LIRs with extremely high identities (>99%) both in Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 and PCC 8802, 48 and this LIR sequences were only detected in the flanking regions of the inverted fragment from these two closely related strains. Likewise, the 188-kb inversion between S.elongates PCC 6301 and PCC 7942 was also flanked by a pair of 0.5-kb LIRs with >81% identities in both strains. 47 The above evidences may suggest that LIRs were closely related to the chromosomal inversion. Previous study on phylum Proteobacteria demonstrated that extensively rearranged genomes contain a high number of repeats among closely related bacteria. 49 The negative association between the number of repeats and genome stability has been observed and statistically confirmed in <U+03B3>-proteobacteria, where the genomes contained more repeats undergoing accelerated rearrangement rates, while genomes lacking repeats were more stable. 50 Based on these molecular evidences, previous explanations for the possible mechanisms underlying chromosomal inversion included illegitimate recombination, 51–53 intra-chromosomally homologous recombination, 54 as well as integrase-mediated site-specific recombination. 55,56 When compared with these mechanisms, restriction enzyme-mediated chromosomal inversions might be oversimplified, yet could serve as a new mechanistic model for chromosomal rearrangements. The proposed model for restriction enzyme-mediated chromosomal inversion has been described in Supplementary Figure S2 . 3.4. Repeat sequences in Arthrospira One of the most notable features of the cyanobacterial genome is the predominance of various repeated sequences. Genome-wide clustering analysis of all the genes of Oscillatoriales genomes, respectively, revealed that members of genus Arthrospira possessed the lowest C/W ratios at any level of homology, which in turn suggested that these underwent multiple duplication events during speciation ( Fig. 7 ). C/W ratio represented the number of total clusters divided by the number of total genes. Moreover, members of Arthrospira , particularly A. platensis NIES-39 and A. platensis YZ, showed the highest R/T ratios, which was suggested that gene duplication in Arthrospira widely occurred. This ratio was calculated as the number of redundant gene clusters that comprised at least two genes divided by the total number of clusters. In A. platensis YZ, a total of 327 genes were determined to have been duplicated at least once, which in turn resulted in the generation of 2,020 redundant genes constituting approximately one-third of the total gene and one-sixth of the complete genome size ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In general, in addition to a large number of uncharacterized genes, these duplicated genes are functionally involved in replication, recombination, energy production, transcription, and post-translational modification. Among these redundant sequences, the most frequently duplicated genes were RTase, transposase, and integrase (194, 159, and 12 copies, respectively), which were derived from 4, 23, and 1 clusters, respectively. We then investigated the probable origin of these enzymes. First, sequence alignment of 12 integrases showed >84% global amino acid similarity, and these integrases were further subdivided into three subtypes, which was suggestive that multiplication of integrase-encoding genes in A. platensis YZ genome was most probably generated by multiple gene duplication events that were accompanied by amino acid substitutions ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Second, we constructed the phylogenetic relationship of the two largest RTase clusters (clusters 527 and 4099, Supplementary Table S1 ), which contained 79 and 73 members, respectively. The RTases derived from the same cluster were located together, yet showed distinct boundaries between clusters ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). This indicated that hundreds of RTase paralogs might have been derived from several common ancestors. Another significant characteristic of duplicated genes was that they were usually adjacently located or duplication-linked with a plenty of unknown functions, some of which can be annotated by one or two of the three enzymes (RTase, transposase, and integrase), and these duplicated fragments varied in size from several to dozens of kilobases. 57–59 This was also partially identified by the observation of contiguous relationships of duplicated genes after sorted by their coordinates in the genome. Therefore, sequence duplication might significantly contribute to the genomic architecture of Arthrospira genomes, which resulted in the formation of various long repeats at both orientations. Previous studies have shown that a large proportion of the transposases and RTase constituted the long repeated sequences in some cyanobacteria. 57–60 For example, 93% of 362 transposases of Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 emerged in the long repeats. 59 However, because most of the duplicated genes are functionally unknown, besides chromosomal rearrangements, the potential phylogenetic roles of multiple sequence duplication events in the Arthrospira are remaining elusive.  Gene duplication in selected species of Oscillatoriales . The total genes from each species are clustered at 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100% amino acid sequence identities. For one certain species at one certain resolution, the C/W ratio represents the total number of clusters divided by the total number of genes. R/W ratio represents the number of redundant gene clusters (the clusters that comprised at least two genes) divided by the total number of clusters.  Gene duplication in selected species of Oscillatoriales . The total genes from each species are clustered at 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100% amino acid sequence identities.

R/W ratio represents the number of redundant gene clusters (the clusters that comprised at least two genes) divided by the total number of clusters.  TRs are patterns of nucleotide sequence directly adjacent to each other. Distributions of TRs in the genomic loci are also recognized as the variable number of TR regions that have been widely used to determine an individual's inherited traits as well as for molecular typing both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. 61 Based on the size of the repeat motif, TRs were classified into microsatellites, minisatellites, and macrosatellites with the motif sizes varying from 1 to 9, 10 to 100, and >100 bp, respectively. 62 Examining the four Arthrospira genomes showed that 870, 736, 1,148, and 848 TRs-containing loci (TRL) were presented in Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005, A. platensis C1, A. platensis NIES-39, and A. platensis YZ, respectively ( Fig. 8A ), which represented 789, 666, 1,009, and 766 non-redundant repeat motifs ( Fig. 8B ). The size of these core repeat motifs varied from several base pairs to 1.9 kb that led to form the longest single TRL up to 8.1 kb. Comparative analyses showed that the number of shared repeat motifs among strains derived from the same groups was significantly more than those from different groups ( Fig. 8B ). Only six commonly shared repeat motifs were identified, suggesting that conservation of TRs among four strains was weak. Additionally, more overlapped repeats at both quantity and proportion level may indicate that the evolutionary relationship between A. platensis NIES-39 and A. platensis YZ was closer than that between Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1.  Distribution of TRs and their relationships among four Arthrospira genomes.

CRISPRs, a type of important repeat elements, are related to the adaptive immunity system that has been widely identified and characterized in many archaea and bacteria. 63,64 We comparatively analysed the distribution of CRISPR and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems among four Arthrospira genomes. On the whole, A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39 harboured three typical regions (Block I-III of Fig. 9A ) that contained the CRISPR-Cas system, whereas only two regions were identified in A. platensis C1 and Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 (Block I and II of Fig. 9B ). It is interesting to find that two CRISPR arrays were adjacently located next to different cas gene organization in all strains as shown in Figure 9 Blocks I. The repeat motif of the corresponding CRISPR array was approximately identical to the ones from the members belonging to the same or different groups represented as global genomic synteny, except the slight diversity was presented in the latter array between members from the different groups. Strains derived from the same groups also showed the high similarity in cas gene organization. The main differences for the same CRISPR-Cas systems among strains involved copy number of repeats and the diversity of spacers ( Supplementary Material S3 ). A. platensis NIES-39 and A. platensis C1 harboured more repeats and spacers than A. platensis YZ and Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005, respectively. Furthermore, we also found that one cas gene cluser in all the four strains (Csm1-Csm2-Csm3-Csm4-Csm5-Cas6-CasTM1812 in A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39, Csm1/Csm2-Csm3-Csm4-Csm5-CasTM1812 in A. platensis C1 and Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005) was not CRISPR-associated, which contradicted the general description of cas gene distribution, because we did not identify any CRISPR array that was proximal to the cas gene cluster. In addition to these typical CRISPR-Cas systems, several CRISPR arrays were also detected in the four genomes without a cas gene located within their proximal regions.  The CRISPR-Cas system loci in the four Arthrospira genomes. Block I-III from left panel (A) showed the organization of CRISPR- Cas systems in A. platensis YZ and A. platensis NIES-39, and the Block I-II from right panel (B) showed the counterparts in Arthrospira sp.

In conclusion, A. platensis YZ was more closely related to A. platensis NIES-39 than Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 and A. platensis C1 at various levels. Comparative genomics and clustering analyses suggested that the Arthrospira genome was highly fluid and exceptionally plastic, which was characterized by extensive chromosomal rearrangements, a large number of repetitive sequences as well as genes encoding transposases, RTases, recombinases, and restriction enzymes. Therefore, speciation of Arthrospira and the specialization for an ecological niche were accompanied by a large scale reorganization of its genomic structure. These findings will facilitate in better understanding the process of speciation and diversification in A.platensis .

IntroductionPlasmodium falciparum , the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, uses a complex developmental programme to propagate within the human host and mosquito vector. 1 Disease pathogenesis in humans correlates with asexual development when the parasite resides within mature erythrocytes and mitotically replicates its haploid genome. In addition to meiotic recombination during diploid stages in mosquitoes, 2 it is during mitosis that the parasite expands its genetic diversity via homologous recombination, leading to the acquisition of new variants of virulence-associated surface adhesion molecules such as erythrocyte membrane protein 1 [ P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1(PfEMP1); encoded by var genes]. 3–5 Importantly, this is the stage at which the parasite evolves drug resistance. 6,7 In fact, it has been estimated that for each cycle of intraerythrocytic replication, laboratory-adapted parasites can tolerate a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation rate of approximately 0.5–1 × 10 -9 per base, 3,4 and that nearly 0.2% of daughter parasites carry a new chimeric PfEMP1 molecule. 4 Furthermore, the heterogeneity within the human host can be amplified by multiple mosquito bites, which may harbour genetically diverse parasite populations. There is, therefore, great interest in evaluating the genetic complexity of the infectious pool of parasites in malaria-endemic regions, with the specific aims of improving surveillance and intervention strategies.  The ~23 Mb P. falciparum genome is organized into 14 chromosomes that range in size from 0.65 to 3.4 Mb. The draft sequence of the P. falciparum genome, which was first reported in 2002 using shotgun-sequencing methods for the laboratory-adapted strain 3D7, 8 revealed that the genome has an overall (A + T) composition of 80.6%, making it one of the most AT-rich genomes identified to date. The complexity of the genome is further underscored by the presence of extended tracts of As, Ts and TAs, in introns, intergenic and centromeric regions [up to 99% (A + T) content]; subtelomeric, hypervariable multigene virulence families, including the ~60-member var gene family 9 ; and large segments of repetitive sequences, especially in subtelomeric regions. Given these unique features, not only has accurate sequencing of P. falciparum DNA presented a technical challenge for most next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, 10–14 it has been suggested that the use of the current 3D7 genome sequence as a reference for clinical isolates results in incomplete estimates of genetic diversity. 15,16 To date, researchers have primarily used PCR-based whole genome amplification (WGA) methods to prepare short read sequencing libraries of P. falciparum laboratory-adapted and clinical strains, 3,4,6,17–21 with Nair et al. applying this to single cell sequencing. 22 More recently, Oyola et al. used f29 DNA polymerase-based multiple displacement alignment (MDA), in the presence of the detergent tetramethylammonium chloride, to analyse the P . falciparum genome and showed that very low quantities of genomic DNA (~10 pg) were sufficient to generate multiplexed Illumina libraries. 11 However, the introduction of errors and bias during PCR-based WGA, 23 and the subsequent alignment-based mapping of short reads to the reference 3D7 genome 8 ( http://genedb.org ; 23.3 Mb assembly) may have led to an overestimation of SNPs in the sequencing data. Indeed, Oyola et al. observed that MDA introduces several per cent (2–6%) of de novo SNP calls as compared to a non-amplified library. 11 Furthermore, none of these studies analysed larger structural variants, except for Bopp et al. 3 and Claessens et al. 4 Therefore, we have a fragmented view of P. falciparum genome plasticity, in which SNPs are evaluated at high frequency but polymorphisms such as insertions and deletions, copy number variants, chromosomal rearrangements and structural variants in hypervariable and highly repetitive regions, are often underestimated or largely ignored. 16 One solution that may overcome all of these caveats is the utilization of amplification-free long-read NGS technologies to sequence the P. falciparum genome. Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, which was the first such technology described, 24 generates long-reads with little to no sequence context bias, 13,14,25 with the most recent version of the DNA polymerase (P6) combined with C4 sequencing chemistry producing reads of average length 10–15 kb. 25 Numerous studies have shown that by oversampling a genome, structural variants can be detected with confidence, 26,27 and de novo assembly can be performed with high accuracy. 28–30 Attempts to analyse P. falciparum genomic DNA with early SMRT sequencing chemistry (P1-C1) generated ~700–1,500 base long-reads, which did not allow for complete de novo assembly or evaluation of structural variations. 13,14,31 Therefore, to develop a robust long-read sequencing and de novo assembly protocol to analyse the P. falciparum genome, we utilized the Pacific Biosciences RS II System with P6-C4 chemistry. Accordingly, we sequenced the genome of the strain 3D7 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and generated sequencing reads that had an average read length of 11–13 kb (maximum 45–50 kb), comprising over 5.26 Gb of data. The resulting sequences were assembled de novo into a highly accurate P. falciparum genome using the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP), 29 with all 14 chromosomes resolved into single contigs. Even extremely AT-rich regions, including the centromeres, were resolved with uniform coverage and for the first time, subtelomeric regions of all chromosomes were successfully assembled in a single run. We present an initial analysis of the de novo- assembled P. falciparum genome and discuss the advances that can now be made with regards to estimating P. falciparum genetic diversity using long-read sequencing technologies. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Growth of P. falciparum Blood stages of the P. falciparum laboratory strain 3D7 were grown according to Trager and Jensen 32 with a few changes. Briefly, a mixed stage culture of P. falciparum was grown in white blood cell (WBC)-free O+ human erythrocytes (prepared from whole blood by treatment with leucocyte-specific filters) at a haematocrit of 4% in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium containing L-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% v/v Albumax II (Invitrogen) and 200 µm hypoxanthine (C.C.Pro). The cultures were grown in a gas environment of 5% CO 2 , 1% O 2 and 94% N 2 to a parasitaemia of 3–8% before harvesting for downstream analysis. For synchronization, knob-positive parasites were selected by gelatin flotation using Plasmion (Fresenius Kabi) 33 and after re-invasion, treated twice with 5% sorbitol (Sigma) 34 to obtain parasites that were synchronized within a window of approximately 6 h, as evaluated by Giemsa staining. 2.2. Genomic DNA isolation Infected human erythrocytes at different parasitaemia were harvested and 1 ml or 5 ml aliquots were frozen at - 20 °C. Subsequently, genomic DNA was prepared using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) or the Genomic Tip kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For the DNeasy kit, free parasites that were obtained from the infected human erythrocyte pellet by saponin lysis 35 were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated as per manufacturer’s instructions. For the Genomic Tip kit, nuclei were prepared directly from the infected human erythrocyte pellet as per manufacturer’s instructions. 2.3. DNA purification prior to library preparation To remove heme and its derivatives from P. falciparum genomic DNA, the DNA was purified using one of the three independent methods: (i) magnetic bead-based cleanup; (ii) electrophoretic DNA extraction using the Aurora platform (Boreal Genomics) or (iii) phenol-chloroform extraction. The starting amount of DNA used for each method is indicated in Fig. 1B . For (i), AMPure PB magnetic beads (Pacific Biosciences) were mixed with P. falciparum genomic DNA at a 1:1 (vol:vol) ratio and incubated for 20 min at room temperature (RT) with gentle end-over-end rotation. Following this, the beads were washed twice with 1.5 ml 70% ethanol and allowed to dry briefly at RT before elution with 100 µl of Pacific Biosciences Elution Buffer (EB). For (ii), P. falciparum DNA was electrophoretically purified using the Aurora System (Boreal Genomics), following manufacturer’s instructions in the ‘Experienced User Protocol’. For (iii), P. falciparum genomic DNA was initially mixed with 500 µl buffer containing 1 M NaCl and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Next, an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:23:1) was added to the DNA mixture, inverted to mix and spun in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 g for 10 min at RT. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, mixed with an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and spun at 10,000 g for 10 min at RT. Then, to remove excess polysaccharide, 0.3 volumes of 99.99% ethanol was added to the upper aqueous phase, the mixture was inverted and spun at 10,000 g for 15 min at RT. Finally, DNA present in the upper aqueous phase was precipitated by adding 1.7 volumes of 99.99% ethanol and spinning at 10,000 g for 15 min at RT, followed by two 70% ethanol washes. The DNA pellet was allowed to air-dry at RT for up to 5 min and resuspended in 100 µl of Pacific Biosciences EB. 2.4. SMRTbell library preparation and sequencing Three SMRTbell libraries were constructed for genomic DNA purified with each of the methods described above ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Each library was constructed using ~4 µg of purified DNA and the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0, according to the protocol described in ‘Procedure & Checklist—20 kb Template Preparation Using BluePippin™ Size-Selection System’ (Pacific Biosciences). Briefly, P. falciparum DNA was sheared for 5 min at 3000g or 5,500 rpm using a g-TUBE (Covaris), concentrated with AMPure PB beads and subjected to DNA damage repair and ligation of SMRTbell adapters. Following ligation, extraneous DNA was digested with exonucleases and the SMRTbell library was cleaned and concentrated with AMPure PB beads. The libraries were then subjected to a 20 kb DNA size-selection step using the BluePippin System (SageScience) to remove shorter DNA inserts with a size cut-off of 15 kb. Library quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent 12000 DNA Kit and 2100 Bioanalyzer System (Agilent Technologies), as well as the Qubit dsDNA Broad Range Assay kit and Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Sequencing primer and P6 polymerase were annealed and bound, respectively, to the SMRTbell libraries as recommended by the manufacturer (Pacific Biosciences). To identify the library concentration that would achieve optimal Poisson loading on the SMRT Cell (i.e. ~40% of zero mode waveguides loaded with a single DNA molecule), loading titrations were performed for each library. Based on this analysis, polymerase-bound SMRTbell libraries were loaded at a concentration of 200 pM for libraries cleaned up using magnetic beads and electrophoretic extraction, and at 100 pM for the phenol-chloroform extracted library to achieve comparable sequencing efficiencies. SMRT sequencing was performed on the Pacific Biosciences RS II System using the C4 sequencing kit (Pacific Biosciences), with magnetic bead loading and 240 min movies. Three SMRT cells were run per library type, providing a total of nine SMRT cells worth of data to be used for downstream analysis. Prior to data analysis, raw reads with a predicted polymerase read quality less than 0.80 were filtered out. 2.5. Data analysisDe novo assembly of the P. falciparum genome was carried out using the RS_HGAP_Assembly.3 protocol within Pacific Biosciences’ SMRT Analysis Portal 2.3.0.p2 as previously described 29 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). All parameters were set at their default values with the following exceptions: (i) the minimum subread length was set to 13,000 based on the size distribution of the reads ( Fig. 2A ) and for computational expediency, so as to not exceed 100-fold coverage going into the analysis; (ii) the minimum seed read length was increased to 20,000 from a default of 6,000—this was relative to the value of the minimum subread length; (iii) the genome size was set to 24,000,000 and (iv) the target coverage parameter was increased to 30 from a default of 25 to enhance coverage in the preassembly process (described below), in turn improving the quality of the finished assembly. The first step in RS_HGAP_Assembly.3, i.e. preassembly, utilizes a directed acyclic graph-based consensus procedure to align shorter reads to the longest reads in the sequencing data, thus generating corrected, continuous preassembled reads. 29 Next, the preassembled reads are assembled into larger contigs with the AssembleUnitig algorithm (Pacific Biosciences; https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/SMRT-Analysis/wiki/SMRT-Pipe-Reference-Guide ), which incorporates elements of Celera Assembler 36 for overlapping and layout. Finally, the filtered reads are mapped back to the contigs using Blasr, 37 error-corrected with Quiver 29 to generate a high-quality consensus (referred to here as the SMRT assembly), and then visualized using SMRT View 2.3.0 (Pacific Biosciences).  To assemble the ~32 kb P. falciparum apicoplast genome, reads that did not align to contigs in the SMRT assembly (which comprised only the nuclear genome) were reanalysed in SMRT Analysis Portal 2.3.0.p2 resulting in an apicoplast contig. For the ~6 kb P. falciparum mitochondrial genome, Blasr was used to align the raw sequencing data to the M76611 mitochondrial sequence ( http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/showRecord.do?name=SequenceRecordClasses.SequenceRecordClass&project_id=PlasmoDB&primary_key=M76611 ) and assembly performed with reads that presented partial or full homology to M76611 mitochondrial DNA.  Dot plots comparing the SMRT assembly to the P. falciparum reference genome, Pf3D7_v3.0 ( http://genedb.org ), were rendered with Gepard 38 using default parameters and a word length of 30. To identify structural variations in the genome, we used our new algorithm Assemblytics. 39 Briefly, Assemblytics analyses the whole genome alignment computed by MUMmer 40 and applies a unique length filtering approach to robustly identify structural variations in six classes of variants—insertions, deletions, tandem expansions, tandem contractions, repeat expansions and repeat contractions. Based on the size of the P. falciparum genome, the ‘minimum size of variant’ was set to 2 bp and the ‘minimum unique sequence length to anchor an alignment’ was set to 10 kb, which also becomes the maximum variant size to avoid calling variants above the size of the uniquely mapped sequence. Next, the presence of poly-A, poly-T and poly-AT in the smaller insertions (less than 10 bp) was determined by the following rules: (i) insertion must only contain the repeat sequence (for instance ATA for poly-AT) and (ii) either the 10 bp on the left or the 10 bp on the right must contain at least 6 bp of the repeat (for example, ATATAT in the case of the poly-AT repeat, AAAAAA in the case of poly-A). Finally, to determine whether a variant overlapped with a genomic feature, we performed a left outer join intersect using BEDTools 41 against Pf3D7_v3.0, annotation release 13.0 from plasmodb.org.  Direct alignment of the raw sequencing reads to Pf3D7_v3.0 was carried out using Blasr 37 with default settings. The resulting coverage obtained was 166-fold. 3. Results3.1. High molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from different P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages Critical to obtaining long-reads with Pacific Biosciences’ SMRT sequencing technology is the extraction of high quality, high molecular weight genomic DNA, with a recommended size distribution of 50–150 kb ( http://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/User-Bulletin-Guidelines-for-Preparing-20-kb-SMRTbell-Templates.pdf ). To achieve this, we prepared genomic DNA from the P. falciparum laboratory strain 3D7 cultured in human blood using two different Qiagen kits: the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, which is routinely used by malaria researchers, 35 and the Genomic Tip kit. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A , the size distribution of genomic DNA prepared using the DNeasy kit was between 33.5 and 48.5 kb, in contrast to a size distribution of  >50 kb for genomic DNA prepared with the Genomic Tip kit. We also determined the output of the Genomic Tip kit for 3D7 parasites synchronized at ring (6–18 h post-invasion; non-replicating), trophozoite (28–35 h post-invasion, when DNA replication is initiated) and schizont stages (38–45 h post-invasion, when DNA replication is complete) and found that 3.1 × 10 8 ring stage parasites yielded ~2.5 µg of genomic DNA, while >15 µg of genomic DNA could be extracted from 0.8 × 10 8 schizonts ( Supplementary Fig. S2B ). Extrapolating from these results, we conclude that >10 µg of high molecular weight genomic DNA can be extracted from a P. falciparum schizont culture growing in 500 µl of blood at a parasitaemia of ~2% with Qiagen’s Genomic Tip kit, which is sufficient for downstream library preparation, size-selection and sequencing. 3.2. SMRT sequencing of P. falciparum genomic DNA yielded reads of average length ~12 kb Genomic DNA prepared from blood stage P. falciparum parasites is routinely contaminated with heme and its derivatives. Because these contaminants adversely affect downstream analyses such as PCR and sequencing, 42–44 we examined the efficiency of three different purification methods to clean up P. falciparum genomic DNA isolated from an asynchronous 3D7 culture, prior to SMRTbell library preparation ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). These included: (i) magnetic bead-based cleanup, using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure PB beads, (ii) electrophoretic DNA extraction using the Aurora System from Boreal Genomics and (iii) phenol-chloroform extraction. We found that all three purification methods efficiently removed heme and other contaminants and did not affect the size distribution of the genomic DNA ( Fig. 1A; ‘no shear’). Notably, the magnetic bead-based purification method demonstrated the highest per cent DNA recovery values (54% versus 33 and 36% for phenol-chloroform extraction and Aurora System clean up, respectively) ( Fig. 1B ). Subsequently, we prepared sequencing libraries and observed that DNA purification method did not impact shearing ( Fig. 1A; ‘shear’), SMRTbell library yield ( Fig. 1B ) and BluePippin 20 kb size-selection ( Figs 1B and C ), and efficiently generated size-selected SMRTbell libraries with average insert lengths of ~21 kb ( Figs 1B and C ). Of note, the SMRTbell libraries prepared from phenol-chloroform extracted DNA showed the highest recovery (44%) after size-selection ( Fig. 1B ).  Comparison of SMRTbell library preparation efficiency from P. falciparum genomic DNA purified using three different methods. (A) High molecular weight P. falciparum genomic DNA prepared from an asynchronous culture using the Genomic tip kit was purified by three different methods: (i) AMPure PB magnetic bead-based clean up (Lanes 1 & 2), (ii) electrophoretic DNA extraction using the Aurora System (Lanes 3 & 4) or (iii) phenol-chloroform extraction (Lanes 5 & 6), and sheared as described in Materials and Methods. Quality and size distribution of the sheared DNA (140 ng) was assessed using field-inversion gel electrophoresis (Pippin Pulse System, Sage Science). Size markers included CHEF 8-48 kb DNA Size Standard (Bio-Rad) and 2.5 kb Molecular Ruler (Bio-Rad). (B) SMRTbell libraries prepared using the indicated amount of purified genomic DNA was subjected to size selection on the BluePippin System using a 15 kb cut-off. The DNA yield and % recovery of various steps, library preparation efficiency and size-selection distribution (based on Fig. 2C) of the three DNA purification methods were compared. (C) Size, quantity and quality of SMRTbell libraries before and after size-selection were assessed using the Agilent DNA 12000 kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System.

(C) Size, quantity and quality of SMRTbell libraries before and after size-selection were assessed using the Agilent DNA 12000 kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System.  Thereafter, we used the Pacific Biosciences P6 polymerase, C4 sequencing chemistry and the RS II Sequencing System to analyse the size-selected P. falciparum SMRTbell libraries ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). For libraries derived from each purification method, we ran three SMRT cells for 4 h, resulting in 525,996 raw sequencing reads that totalled 5.26 Gb from nine pooled SMRT cells ( Fig. 2A ). SMRTbell libraries derived from phenol-chloroform extracted DNA provided greater sequencing yields at lower loading requirements, although average read lengths were slightly shorter (not statistically significant) than libraries generated from other purification methods. On average, 58,444 reads were generated per SMRT cell, with a read length of 12.1 kb ( Fig. 2A ), and a tail in the read length distribution reaching close to 50 kb ( Fig. 2B ). Moreover, 50% of the sequenced bases originated from reads that were =15.5 kb long ( Fig. 2A; read N50), suggesting that the Pacific Biosciences P6 polymerase may be capable of sequencing through long stretches of highly AT-rich genomic content, confirming prior reports of little to no sequence-context bias of SMRT sequencing. 13,14,25 SMRT sequencing of P. falciparum genomic DNA yields >500,000 reads of average length 12.31 kb, with a read length N50 of 15.46 kb.

End-to-end de novo assembly of all 14 P. falciparum chromosomes We next performed de novo assembly of filtered reads (4.26 Gb data comprising 325,565 reads of N50 18.168 kb; Fig. 2C ) using the HGAP protocol in SMRT Portal 2.3.0.p2, with changes made to the default settings as described in Materials and Methods. The resulting assembly (hereafter referred to as the SMRT assembly) had a total genome size of 23.6 Mb ( Fig. 3A ) and produced a total of 21 contigs ( Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A–U ; Supplementary Table S1 ). Thirteen of the 21 contigs were complete, individual P. falciparum chromosomes (chr. 2–14) ranging in length from 0.943 to 3.286 Mb ( Fig. 3B ), while the remaining eight contigs represented a 620 kb portion of chromosome 1 (contig 20) and 20–60 kb repeat regions that aligned to chromosome ends. One of these repeats corresponded to the left arm of chromosome 1 (contig 64; discussed in detail below), but the remaining six contigs could not be correctly assigned to a single chromosome end ( Supplementary Table S1 ; Supplementary Figs. S3P–U ). We consider these to be spurious contigs that may have arisen from high coverage of repetitive regions and do not have any discernible protein-coding or non-coding RNA (ncRNA) features. De novo assembly using HGAP resolves all 14 P. falciparum chromosomes. (A) Summary of the SMRT assembly metrics for the P. falciparum genome. Contig N50 is a weighted median statistic such that 50% of the entire assembly is contained in contigs or scaffolds equal to or larger than this value, and QV50 indicates an estimated accuracy of 99.999% for the assembly. (B) All 14 P. falciparum chromosomes were assembled end-to-end using HGAP, without any gaps. The only exception was chr. 1, whose left arm was assembled as separate contig of 0.35 kb. The contig name in the SMRT assembly, its size, the corresponding chromosome and its coverage are indicated. The scale of coverage is between ×0 (blue arrowhead) and 150 (red arrowhead) except for contig 64, where the scale is from 0 to 100. The centromere position in each contig is indicated with the green line. (C) Contig 12 of the SMRT assembly, which aligns to P. falciparum chr. 7, was completely assembled using HGAP and showed a depth of coverage between ×70 and ×140.

The centromere position in each contig is indicated with the green line. (C) Contig 12 of the SMRT assembly, which aligns to P. falciparum chr. 7, was completely assembled using HGAP and showed a depth of coverage between ×70 and ×140.  Each of the 13 fully resolved chromosomes featured distinct edges at either end, where coverage abruptly stopped and beyond which reads did not extend ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3A–M ). These ends are highly homologous to each other, both within the same chromosome and between different chromosomes, and contain several copies of the telomeric repetitive element CCCTNAA, indicating complete telomere-to-telomere assembly of chr. 2–14. A representative coverage plot for contig 12, i.e. chr. 7, is shown ( Fig. 3C ). In the case of chr. 1, we observed that the 620 kb contig 20 began with a gradual increase in coverage (left end) and ended with a distinct edge containing telomeric repeats (right end) ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3O ). We, therefore, searched for a contig that could be contiguous with contig 20 and identified the 37 kb contig 64 ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3N ), which had a distinct telomeric repeat-containing edge at its left end and a gradual drop off in coverage at its right end. The manual joining of these two contigs yielded full-length chr. 1. Finally, because the genomes of the mitochondria [~6 kb; 68.4% (A + T) content] and apicoplast [~32 kb; 85.8% (A + T) content] were absent from the SMRT assembly, we selected reads that did not align to the nuclear chromosomes from the raw sequencing data and reanalysed them with independent HGAP calculations (detailed in Materials and Methods). In doing so, we completely assembled the genomes of these key organelles ( Supplementary Figs S3W and S3X ). Of note, the mitochondrial genome was assembled as a ~38 kb contig ( Supplementary Fig. S3W ), indicating that it exists as circular tandem duplications of itself: in this case, as six copies of the 6 kb genome.  We compared our SMRT assembly to other de novo assemblies of the P. falciparum genome that were generated using data from Roche 454 pyrosequencing, 45 Sanger shotgun sequencing 46 or Illumina-based sequencing by synthesis 47 of different P. falciparum strains ( Table 1 ). We found that our assembly was the most complete: it comprised 23.6 Mb and contained the least number of contigs, with an average contig N50 of 1.71 Mb. Moreover, in comparison to previous studies that performed SMRT sequencing of P. falciparum genomic DNA, 13,14,31 we generated over 10-fold longer reads with an average genome coverage of × 94; indeed, we believe that our HGAP-derived SMRT assembly is the first of its kind for P. falciparum .

Analysis of centromeres and subtelomeric regions Given the telomere-to-telomere nature of the SMRT assembly, we were specifically interested in the coverage of two challenging P. falciparum genomic regions: (i) centromeres, which have elevated AT-richness [between 90 and 99% (A + T) content] 8,48,49 and (ii) subtelomeric regions, which contain six varieties of telomere-associated repeats, multigene families such as var, rifin and stevor , 8 and where much of the chromosomal length variation occurs. 50 We observed that in the case of all centromeres, depth of coverage was ×80–140 ( Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S3 —see the green line that indicates centromere position): for example, the region of chr. 14 that is marked by the centromeric histone PfCenH3, PF3D7_14:1070851-1075311, 48 was sequenced with a coverage of ~×140, as was the core ~2.5 kb centromere ( Fig. 4A ). This indicated that the highly AT-rich nature of centromeres, as well as the presence of atypical repeats such as AATTAA, 48 did not impede the processivity of the polymerase during sequencing. Similarly, we observed even coverage of most telomeric and subtelomeric ends (×80–140; Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3 ), suggesting that the >11 kb length of the SMRT reads is sufficient to differentiate between regions of very high homology. The depth of coverage of the SMRT assembly and length of SMRT reads are sufficient to resolve centromeres and subtelomeric regions. (A) The depth of coverage of the ~4.5 kb PfCenH3-occupied region of chromosome 14, which averages 92% (A + T), is shown. Zooming in, the raw sequences obtained for a 176 bp fragment of the core centromere are shown. (B) The depth of coverage of the ~34.6 kb telomeric/subtelomeric region of chromosome 5 is shown, where each grey line represents a single read. Note that the horizontal black lines represent reads that do not map uniquely to the assembly and have a mapping QV of zero.The depth of coverage of the SMRT assembly and length of SMRT reads are sufficient to resolve centromeres and subtelomeric regions.

Novel genomic features and structural variants were resolved in the SMRT assembly To determine if this new SMRT assembly could enhance our understanding of parasite genome organization, we compared our data to the reference 3D7 genome 8 and noted that the total size of the chromosomal contigs in the SMRT assembly, i.e. 23,294,534 bp, was comparable to the 23,292,622 bp resolved in the reference genome ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Moreover, the sizes of most chromosomes were similar between the two assemblies with the maximum increase in size presented by the stitched SMRT chr. 1 at 3% and the maximum decrease in size presented by chr. 8 at 1.2% ( Supplementary Table S1 ). When we visualized the comparison using dot plots, as shown in the representative dot plot for chr. 7 ( Fig. 5A ) and other chromosomes ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ), we found that while the majority of assembled sequences aligned well with the reference genome, the increase in chr. 1 size in the SMRT assembly was due to the lengthening of its left arm ( Supplementary Fig. S4A ), and the decrease in chr. 8 size was due to a shortening of its right arm ( Supplementary Fig. S4H ). Upon closer analysis, we concluded that both of these size discrepancies originated from changes in the lengths of subtelomeric repeat sequences.  Dot plots comparing the SMRT assembly to the reference 3D7 genome identify large genomic variants. Dot plots were generated from Gepard nucleotide alignments of chromosomal contigs in the SMRT assembly ( x -axis) and chromosomes assembled in the reference 3D7 genome ( y -axis; Sanger reference 8 ). Each dot is a grey-scale representation of nucleotide identity within a 30-nucleotide window centred on that position. The main diagonal line shows the alignment between the SMRT assembly and the reference genome. Off-diagonal lines parallel to the main diagonal indicate parallel duplications in the chromosome while off-diagonal perpendicular lines indicate inversions. (A) Chromosome 7. (B) Chromosome 10. Zooming into position 1,612,060, a 14 kb tandem duplication was resolved in the SMRT assembly relative to the reference. (C) Chromosome 4. Zooming into position 939,044, a 29 kb insertion was resolved in the SMRT assembly relative to the reference. Further zooming into a position immediately downstream of this insertion, a 1.5 kb stretch was detected in the SMRT assembly that showed very low homology to the corresponding 2.5 kb stretch present in the reference genome, and hence labelled ‘novel’.

(D) Chromosome 12. Zooming into position 1,707,528, a 16 kb tandem duplication was resolved in the SMRT assembly relative to the reference. Plots not drawn to scale.  Furthermore, in select cases, the longer reads generated by SMRT sequencing allowed for the resolution of genomic features that were not previously described for the reference. These included large duplications and insertions ( Figs 5B–D ). For example, at position 1,612,060 of chromosome 10, a 14 kb duplication was apparent in the SMRT assembly relative to the reference ( Fig. 5B ), which results in the addition of three more rifin genes to the P. falciparum genome; PfRifins are virulence molecules that are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, mediate the binding of infected erythrocytes to the vasculature 51 and undergo antigenic variation. 52 Another example is position 939,044 of chromosome 4, where a 29 kb insertion relative to the reference results in the duplication of the following features to the P. falciparum genome: three var genes, one ncRNA-encoding open reading frame (ORF), one rif and one gene encoding a conserved protein of unknown function ( Fig. 5C ). However, this region shows a substantial pileup of extra coverage, indicative of highly repetitive sequences, and may contain additional features that were not fully resolved in the SMRT assembly. One way to address this would be to analyse 40 kb size-selected SMRTbell libraries of P. falciparum DNA. Furthermore, adjacent to this insertion, we observed a 1.5 kb stretch of DNA that was novel compared to the corresponding 2.5 kb stretch in the reference ( Fig. 5C; ‘zoom—novel’) indicating that this subtelomeric region of chromosome 4 may be more complex than previously annotated. As a third example, we detected a 16 kb duplication at position 1,707,528 of chromosome 12 of the SMRT assembly ( Fig. 5D ), which results in the addition of 2 var genes and one ncRNA-encoding ORF to the P. falciparum annotation.  In addition to the features described above that span several kilobases (>10 kb), we utilized our assembly comparison tool called Assemblytics 39 to identify additional structural variants in our SMRT assembly relative to the reference genome. As summarized in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2 , we identified 10,248 insertions, 426 deletions, 22 tandem expansions, 8 tandem contractions, 8 repeat expansions and 3 repeat contractions of size 2 bp to 10 kb in the SMRT assembly; the size distribution of these structural variations is depicted in Figs 6A and B . Interestingly, homopolymer tract expansions, i.e. poly-A, poly-T and poly-AT expansions, of  < 10 bp in size account for ~61% of all insertions identified ( Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Some examples of variants include a 1,019 bp insertion at position 2,328,302 of chr. 13; 280 and 117 bp deletions at positions 1,452,348 of chr. 9 and 754,796 of chr. 13, respectively; a 4,131 bp tandem expansion at position 1,543,910 of chr. 10; a 378 bp tandem contraction at position 17,963 of chr. 4; a 5,100 bp repeat expansion at position 973,156 of chr. 12; and a 1,018 bp repeat contraction at position 965,633 of chr. 4 ( Supplementary Table S2 ). These changes affect genic, intergenic and subtelomeric regions of chromosomes: for example, the 117 bp deletion at position 754,796 of chromosome 13 is within the intronless gene PF3D7_1318300 , which encodes a conserved Plasmodium protein of unknown function, while the 280 bp deletion in chr. 9 affects an intergenic region. Similarly, the 4,131 bp tandem expansion at position 1,543,910 of chr. 10 is within the intronless gene PF3D7_1038400 , which encodes the gametocyte-specific protein Pf11-1, while the 378 bp tandem contraction in chr. 4 is in a subtelomeric region. Therefore, these variants will need to be rigorously curated to understand their impact on parasite biology. Given that the SMRT assembly and the reference match well in contiguity and have nearly the same total sequence length ( Fig. 6C and Supplementary Table S1 ), and given its high-quality score ( Fig. 3A; QV50), we can conclude that our SMRT assembly and the reference genome are of equal quality and that the structural variants identified here are significant to understanding the complexity of the parasite genome.  The majority of variations in the SMRT assembly relative to the reference are small insertions. Variants ranging from 2 to 10 kb in size were called using Assemblytics. 39 (A) Size distribution analysis of variants from 2 to 500 bp in size showed that the majority of insertions are <50 bp in size while the majority of deletions are between 10 and 500 bp in size. The x -axis represents variant size in bp and the y -axis represents a variant number.

Discussion In malaria-endemic areas, P. falciparum parasite genomes are constantly in flux. 16,53 However, our knowledge of P. falciparum genomic variability, which is built on PCR-based genotyping, microarray analyses and short-read NGS, is largely restricted to SNPs. 16 To characterize other genomic variants, particularly those that occur in multigene virulence families and regulatory regions characterized by low sequence complexity such as subtelomeric repeats, there is an urgent need to apply new methods to analyse the P. falciparum genome. Therefore, we adapted the amplification-free, single molecule, long-read sequencing technology developed by Pacific Biosciences to analyse P. falciparum genomic DNA and compiled a new HGAP-derived 23.6 Mb genomic assembly that comprised 14 contiguous end-to-end chromosome sequences. In particular, we accurately resolved repetitive and polymorphic chromosome ends and identified large duplication and insertion events in subtelomeric regions and intra-chromosomal regions (adjacent to coding sequences) with high confidence, suggesting a greater complexity of the P. falciparum genome. In addition, we identified smaller insertions, deletions and tandem expansions in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, all of which can be used to correct and complete the P. falciparum reference genome 8 . It is noteworthy that these variants would have been missed if we had directly aligned the SMRT reads to the reference genome, thereby strongly supporting a hypothesis-free de novo assembly approach, not bound by reference bias.  In the past five yrs, the adaptation of NGS to study P. falciparum clinical isolates in Africa and South-East Asia has provided genome-wide estimates of allele frequency distribution, population structure and linkage disequilibrium in malaria-endemic regions. 18,20 In addition, NGS analysis of the genetic architecture of drug-resistant subpopulations of P. falciparum in Cambodia has identified SNPs that show high levels of differentiation, and other genomic correlates of the spread of resistance. 19 Complementarily, longitudinal studies that measured the genomic plasticity of laboratory-adapted P. falciparum parasites have determined the rates at which var gene polymorphisms are generated during intraerythrocytic development. 3,4 However, all of these studies used PCR-based WGA combined with short-read NGS and relied on the alignment-based mapping of sequencing reads to the reference 3D7 genome 8 to assess genetic diversity. While this method will prove invaluable to analysing SNPs in clinical settings where researchers mostly dispose of low sample volumes, we believe that the read length limitations of these approaches will make the identification of other critical structural variants extremely difficult. Given the lack of sequence bias in SMRT sequencing, 24 length of SMRT reads (>11 kb; compared to the ~8 kb size of a var ORF) and our complete resolution of chromosomal ends and copy number variants of virulence genes such as var and rifin , we argue that long-read sequencing will provide complete reference-grade genomes for P. falciparum field isolates. Such analyses, in combination with other approaches to document SNP variation, will comprehensively determine the geographical diversity of P. falciparum populations and monitor longitudinal population changes of both P. falciparum and other human malaria species.  We recognize that one limitation of our whole genome sequencing approach may be the amount of starting material (~10 µg) that is necessary to prepare high quality, size-selected SMRT sequencing libraries for de novo assembly. For example, if a malaria patient presents with a parasitaemia of >3% rings, around 4 ml of blood will be required to yield ~10 µg of P. falciparum genomic DNA, after eliminating human genomic DNA contamination. 54 In contrast, for cases with lower parasitaemia, ~200–500 µl of patient blood will have to be frozen and recultured with fresh WBC-free blood for one or two generations, or until the cultures reach a parasitaemia of 2% schizonts, before being processed for DNA extraction. Nonetheless, because several studies have shown that clinical isolates can be cultured in vitro from frozen stocks for short periods of time without losing their multiplication and erythrocyte invasion properties, 55,56 we believe that the latter option is feasible to compile SMRT sequencing-based whole genomes of P. falciparum clinical isolates. Furthermore, as sequencing technologies progress and develop, we anticipate that system requirements will change rapidly, consequently leading to a reduction in initial sample input, cost and time to project completion.  In conclusion, our study emphasizes the value of long-read sequencing technologies and de novo genome assembly to fully resolve pathogen genome architecture and complexity, paving the way for comprehensively assessing genetic variation at all size scales. In the specific case of Plasmodium , not only will it provide information about within-host P. falciparum diversity, but it will fill existing gaps in the genome sequences of laboratory-adapted strains as well as of field isolates. Furthermore, the resolution and understanding of P. falciparum structural variants, in particular of multigene families involved in adhesion and immune evasion (Ex: PfEMP1 and PfRifin), and genes involved in erythrocyte invasion (vaccine candidates such as PfAMA1 and PfRh proteins) and sexual stage biology (vaccine candidates such as P48/45, P25 and P28), will provide genetic correlates of parasite virulence and transmissibility. Given the recent assembly of the haploid human genome using SMRT sequencing, 28 we propose that long-read sequencing technologies will be crucial to combining Plasmodium genomic epidemiology with human population genetics to obtain a comprehensive view of parasite behaviour, genetic predisposition of humans to malaria and the co-evolution of parasite and host at a molecular level. Finally, SMRT technology can be used to identify epigenomic variations (Ex: genome-wide DNA methylation patterns) based on the kinetics of the DNA synthesis reaction performed by the polymerase, concurrent with sequencing. 57 Because this method is being utilized to examine both bacterial and eukaryotic epigenomes 58–60 and given the tractable size of the P. falciparum genome, future work could investigate if dynamic changes in DNA methylation 61 of P. falciparum clinical isolates are linked to varying degrees of severe malaria.

Introduction The evolution of genomic base composition depends, in a complex fashion, on mutation and selection. 1 When there is no strand-specific bias in mutation rates and selection pressure, the interstrand base-pairing rule reduces the maximum number of substitution rates to six: r A<U+2192>T  =   r T<U+2192>A , r G<U+2192>C  =   r C<U+2192>G , r A<U+2192>G  =   r T<U+2192>C , r G<U+2192>A  =   r C<U+2192>T , r A<U+2192>C  =   r T<U+2192>G , and r C<U+2192>A  =   r G<U+2192>T , as stated by parity rule 1 (PR1). 2 Under PR1, the average intrastrand base composition of a chromosome is expected to reach an equilibrium state, at which [A] = [T] and [G] = [C], a relationship known as PR2, 2,3 also referred to as Chargaff’s second parity rule.  Most of bacteria abide by PR2 on a chromosome-wide scale. 4–6 Nonetheless, they display distinctive local deviations from this parity, as shown by previous studies. 7–16 The departure from PR2 provides a window into fundamental processes, such as replication, transcription, and repair mechanisms, which act differentially along each DNA strand and induce strand biased substitution rates, shaping DNA sequence contrary to the null expectation of [A] = [T] and [G] = [C] equilibrium. 8,16–22 Lobry suggested that the observed compositional strand-asymmetries are due to differences in replication-associated mutagenesis and repair between leading and lagging strands, 7 and following studies argued along the same lines. 9,23 These asymmetries are also attributed to the uneven gene partition between replication strands 11,16,22,24,25 coupled with transcription-induced mutagenesis and repair, 26 as well as codon and amino acid usage biases. 27–30 From another perspective, nucleotide composition of genes, mainly reflected on GC content, may affect amino acid biases of proteins, as suggested by compositional correlation between DNA and protein sequences, 31 and hydropathy profile studies. 32 Accordingly, mutational pressure, identified on the basis of GC content and DNA compositional biases, can have a major effect on the long-term molecular evolution of proteins.  Though there are numerous studies on mononucleotide strand asymmetries, the distribution of oligonucleotides among different strands seems to have attracted less attention. 33,34 Interestingly, no study has extensively assessed strand asymmetries at the level of dinucleotides, though these oligomers are the primary ordering units of DNA bases. 35 Dinucleotide occurrence ‘preferences’ have been reported since very early 36,37 as a result of nearest-neighbour constraints. The relative abundances (odds-ratios) of dinucleotides quantify such preferences. It has been noted that within the same DNA strand the relative abundance of a given dinucleotide is approximately equal to the one of each reverse complement, 38–40 suggesting a base order intra-strand parity between relative abundances of reverse complementary dinucleotides. Mrázek and Karlin 10 considered whether deviations from this base order intra-strand parity exist. However, based on the limited number of complete genomes then available, they concluded that ‘dinucleotide relative abundances tend to be symmetric and effectively constant relative to the leading and lagging strand for all dinucleotides, despite the strand compositional asymmetry’. 10In this work, we provide statistically solid evidence for the existence of local deviations from intra-strand parity at the level of dinucleotide relative abundances. We show that such skews along coding sequences (CDS) can trace the standard phylogenetic relationships more efficiently than other compositional measures. The skew analysis that we present supports that the GC-biased structure of genetic code shapes compositional asymmetries along coding regions. Moreover, we assess whole-genome substitution strand-biases induced by the molecular machinery of replication, transcription and DNA-repair.2. Materials and methods2.1 Dataset We perform our analysis on the dataset used by Necsulea and Lobry to study DNA base composition asymmetries in prokaryotes. 22 For each bacterial sequence, we retrieved the latest version deposited in NCBI database until 20 April 2015, restricting our collection to species which belong to phyla with more than three members present in the initial dataset. For each chromosome, we retrieve the coordinates of the origin of replication ( ori ) from DoriC 5.0 database. 41 We exclude linear chromosomes whose origin of replication is located less than one-fifth of their total length away from their ends. In total, 340 DNA sequences of the initial dataset meet the above prerequisites and constitute our genomic dataset. 2.2 Definition of skews Mononucleotide skews are computed as the following ratios: SA-T=fA-fTfA+fT  and SG-C=fG-fCfG+fC , where fX is the observed frequency of X <U+2208> {A, T, G, C} in a given DNA sequence.  For each pair of reverse complementary dinucleotides, the observed frequency skew is computed as the following ratio: SXY-Y'X'=fXY-fY'X'fXY+fY'X' , where Y'X' is the reverse complement of XY and fXY , fY'X' are the observed frequencies of the corresponding dinucleotides, as in reference. 39 We introduce the relative abundance skews of reverse complementary dinucleotides, which are given by the formula: PXY-Y'X'=<U+03C1>XY-<U+03C1>Y'X' where Y'X' is the reverse complement of XY and <U+03C1>XY , <U+03C1>Y'X' are the relative abundances of the corresponding dinucleotides. The relative abundance of a given dinucleotide is the ratio of its observed frequency to expected frequency, the later being the product of the observed frequencies of its mononucleotide components. Hence <U+03C1>XY  =  fXY/fXfY . Note that, from the 16 distinct dinucleotides, 4 of them are identical to their reverse complementary ones. The remaining 12 form 6 pairs of reverse complementary dinucleotides, namely AG-CT, GA-TC, GG-CC, AA-TT, AC-GT and CA-TG, for which we study the dinucleotide frequency and relative abundance skews.2.3 Graphical representation of skews For every chromosome in our collection, we calculate the skews along the plus strand in reference sequence in adjacent, non-overlapping windows of 10 4 bp length and plot their non-cumulative and cumulative diagrams. The coordinates of all circular chromosomes are shifted so that the ori is placed at the middle of their published sequence. Then, the ter is set as the location of ori plus half of the chromosomes length, as in previous genomic studies. 42,43 In this way, the ter region corresponds to the end (or, which is the same, to the start), of the shifted sequences, with the first half of each diagram corresponding to the lagging strand, and the second half to the leading strand. 2.4 CDS concatenates From each DNA sequence, we retrieve the coding strand of all its protein-coding genes, in their sense direction, and concatenate them to form an artificial sequence, the ‘CDS concatenate’. The ordering of these coding strands maintains their relative position along the original DNA sequence. As the ori usually does not overlap with protein-coding genes, we detect the region of CDS concatenates which is closer to the ori . For all circular sequences we shift the coordinates of CDS concatenates so that this region will be placed at the middle of these artificial sequences. 2.5 Detecting breakpoints in skew patterns In many bacterial chromosomes, mononucleotide skews are close to constant along the leading or lagging strand, with their sign changing near the ori and ter . Thus, it is reasonable to assume that mononucleotide skews fit a linear regression model along each replication strand. In this context, ori (or ter ) represents a breakpoint, where the model coefficients shift from one stable regression relationship to a different one. To test the statistical significance of these structural changes in mononucleotide skew patterns and assess whether such changes also appear in dinucleotide frequency and relative abundance skews, we use a dynamic programming algorithm developed in references, 44,45 as implemented in the R package strucchange. 46 The algorithm allows simultaneous estimation of multiple breakpoints by assessing deviations from stability in the fitted linear regression model. It computes the number and position of the optimal breakpoints from data alone, with no a priori knowledge. We apply this algorithm in skews along both plus strand and CDS concatenates, and plot the resulting fitted models. 2.6 Correlation of strand compositional asymmetries with species phylogeny We group the skews along the CDS concatenates into three classes; ‘mononucleotide skews’ ( VMONO ): SCDSA-T and SCDSG-C , ‘dinucleotide skews’ ( VDI ): SCDSXY-Y'X' , and ‘relative abundance skews’ ( VRA ): PCDSXY-Y'X' , where XY-Y'X' <U+2208> {AG-CT, GA-TC, GG-CC, AA-TT, AC-GT, CA-TG}. Each of these classes can be seen as a multidimensional random variable, corresponding to a list of vectors of skew values. We compute the V MONO , V DI , and V RA along the CDS concatenates in adjacent, non-overlapping windows of 10 4 bp length. To assess the similarity between the skew patterns of any two CDS concatenates, we pairwise compare the multivariate distribution of each of their variables (V MONO , V DI , V RA ) using the symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. 47 Thus, the symmetric KL-divergence quantifies the dissimilarity between each pair of bacteria present in our collection, in terms of skew profiles along the corresponding CDS concatenates.  We group the bacteria of our collection according to their phylum, and, in the case of Proteobacteria (which is by far the largest phylum in our dataset), according to their class. For each of these groups, we perform complete-linkage hierarchical clustering of the CDS concatenates, using the symmetric KL-divergence of their V MONO or V DI or V RA , to obtain the corresponding cladograms (skew-based trees). For purposes of this analysis, if a species has more than one chromosomes, we keep the largest chromosome excluding any other (a total of 29 DNA sequences). We employ the web-based tool Compare2Trees 48 to compare the topology of the skew-based trees and the species-trees, corresponding to the phylogenetic relations of bacteria. We obtained the species-tree from NCBI Taxonomy, 49 which provides a sequence-based phylogenetic classification, manually curated to reflect the current consensus in the systematic literature. The scores resulting from Compare2Trees express the percent topological similarity of the trees and indicate whether V MONO , V DI , V RA can trace bacterial species phylogeny. We use as benchmark the topological scores corresponding to cladograms we construct based on the d - distance of the genomic signatures. 50,51 In order to detect correlations of skews with bacterial phylogeny, we use the multidimensional variables V MONO , V DI , and V RA instead of each skew separately, because if i.e. the rates of A<U+2192>G transitions differer among species, this will simultaneously affect both SCDSA-T and SCDSG-C . Moreover, in the same example, if the rates of A<U+2192>G are context - dependent, this may also affect all relative abundance skews, since the six reverse complementary dinucleotide pairs we examine have all at least one dinucleotide which contains an A or a G. 2.7 Evolutionary relations of CDSs We retrieve the non-supervised orthologous groups from EggNOG v4.0 database. 52 We consider orthologous genes at the taxonomic levels for which our cladistic diagrams are constructed. For all species within a given taxonomic level, we pick out of each chromosome the coding strands of the genes which have orthologs in no >10% of these species (or in just one of them, for taxonomic groups with few members present in our collection). These CDSs form the ‘ low - coverage orthologs’ group of the chromosome. All other orthologs detected in the respective chromosome form the ‘ remaining orthologs, (complementary) group. For species with more than one chromosomes we keet the largest one and exclude all the others. We also exclude from our analysis the chromosomes of the species which are not represented in the eggNOG v4.0 database. Thereafter, a total of 266 DNA sequences are taken into account.2.8 Transcription- and replication-associated skews To detect mutation-derived skews we use third 4-fold-degenerate sites (third-ff), which are not subject to selection on the encoded amino-acid. We consider nucleotide composition in the sense direction and distinguish between codon-sites of genes lying on leading and lagging strand, where replication and transcription progress in the same or opposite direction, respectively. For each skew, let SK sense,leading and SK sense,lagging be its values in the first and second set of codon-sites, respectively. For explanatory purposes, let us denote by a the transcription-induced component of this skew and by ß the replication-induced component. Transcription-induced skews have opposite signs in sense versus anti-sense strands. We consider a with respect to the sense strand. Likewise, replication-induced skews have opposite signs in leading versus lagging strand. We consider ß with respect to the leading strand. Then, SK sense,leading  ˜  a  +  ß and SK sense,lagging  ˜  a – ß . We define the transcription-associated (Trs) skew as SKsense,leading+SKsense,lagging2 , which is an estimate of a . Likewise, we define the replication-associated (Rep) skew as SKsense,leading-SKsense,lagging2 , which is an estimate of ß . The above formulation provides a heuristic decoupling of the effect of replication and transcription on stand asymmetries, represented by Rep and Trs, respectively.  Because certain base substitutions depend on the identity of the adjacent nucleotides, 53 we also have to take into account flanking neighbours of third-ff sites. Since there are no 4-fold degenerate codons with A at their second position, we only consider dinucleotides, X 3 Y 1 , occupying a third-ff site and the first site of the adjacent codon, as described in. 54 In this context, the relative abundance of X 3 Y 1 is: <U+03C1> X3Y1  =  f3XY1 / f3Xf1Y , with f3X and f1Y being the frequencies of X and Y at third-ff and their neighbouring first sites, respectively, with X, Y <U+2208> {A, T, G, C}. 2.9 Transcription-coupled repair and PolIII a-subunit isoforms To identify which bacteria possess the mfd gene [transcription-coupled repair (TCR)-proficient] and what type of polymerase III (PolIII) a- subunit isoform they bear, we retrieve the corresponding data from the KEGG Orthology database .553. Results and discussion3.1 Relative abundance skews constitute a general property of bacterial genomes A convenient way to analyse strand biases of single base distribution is by means of S A-T and S G-C cumulative diagrams. 56 Likewise, cumulative diagrams of dinucleotide and relative abundance skews can be used to assess compositional asymmetries at the level of dinucleotide observed frequencies ( f ) and relative abundances ( <U+03C1> ), respectively. In Figure 1 we indicatively present the cumulative skew diagrams of CA–TG and AC–GT pairs along the plus strand of the chromosome of Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z - 2901. The diagrams, in terms of both f and <U+03C1> , present a characteristic V/inverted-V shape, with their extreme located at the ori site. Relative abundance skew patterns are reported here for the first time. These highly structured patterns point to intra-strand asymmetries that should be rather significant, both statistically and biologically.  Cumulative skew diagrams along the plus strand of the chromosome of Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z - 2,901. In each diagram, both dinucleotide skews (continuous line) and relative abundance skews (dashed line) are plotted. For the full set of cumulative skew diagrams, corresponding to all genomes in our collection, see link to Additional Figures and Tables.  Cumulative skew diagrams along the plus strand of the chromosome of Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z - 2,901. In each diagram, both dinucleotide skews (continuous line) and relative abundance skews (dashed line) are plotted. For the full set of cumulative skew diagrams, corresponding to all genomes in our collection, see link to Additional Figures and Tables.  Strand asymmetries in substitution rates of a nucleotide can be drastically affected by its flanking neighbours, in a genome-wide scale. Dinucleotide frequency skews can emerge from strand-biased substitution processes which are either neighbour-dependent or-independent. On the contrary , persistent patterns of relative abundance skews can only result from strand biases of neighbour-dependent substitutions.  The SplusCA–TG and PplusCA–TG curves point towards the same direction, both displaying a clear inverted-V shape. On the other hand, the SplusAC–GT and PplusAC–GT curves point in the opposite direction, the former bearing an inverted-V and the latter a V shape. This is an indication of the different modalities acting on the formation of compositional skews (i.e. SplusAC–GT ) and nearest-neighbour preference skews (i.e. PplusAC–GT ).  From Figure 1b it follows that GT is more frequently occurring in leading strand than AC, in accordance with an excess of G and T versus C and A. However, the relative abundance of AC in leading strand is higher than the one of GT. Unlike observed frequencies, the relative abundances of dinucleotides factor out the effect of single-base composition and their skews cannot be inferred from the corresponding mono- and di-nucleotide ones. Instead, relative abundance skews constitute an alignment-free index which effectively detects chromosomal regions where context-dependent substitutions are strand-biased.  The patterns in Figure 1 indicate that the depicted skews are quasi-constant along the leading or lagging strand and have opposite sign upstream and downstream the ori . To assess the statistical significance of the observed changes in skew polarity we use a linear regression setup. 44,45 The fitted models of SplusAC–GT and PplusAC–GT display sharp, step-like breakpoints at the ori site ( Fig. 2a and c ), denoting that dinucleotide and relative abundance skews significantly correlate with the mode of replication. These breakpoints illustrate asymmetric substitution patterns in the two replication strands. 8 Diagrams (thin curve) and fitted linear models (thick line) for SAC-GT and PAC-GT in Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z - 2,901, along the plus (published) strand ( a and c ) and the CDS concatenate ( b and d ). The vertical dashed straight line indicates the ori . The horizontal dashed straight line is drawn at the mean value of the skew. Along the plus strand skews display a step-like breakpoint at the ori and their mean values approximately equal zero, since skews in leading and lagging strand are almost cancelled out on a genome scale (a and c). On the contrary, skews along CDS concatenates display no structural change near the ori and their mean considerably departs from zero (b and d).

On the contrary, skews along CDS concatenates display no structural change near the ori and their mean considerably departs from zero (b and d).  Compositional skews may also emerge due to substitution strand-biases associated with CDSs. 26 To address this question, we use the same linear regression setup to model SCDSAC–GT and PCDSAC–GT along the corresponding CDS concatenates, where all genes are considered in the direction of transcription. In this way, consecutive parts of the leading and lagging strand are alternating within both halves of the genome as delimited by ori . Thus, along CDS concatenates the effect of replication on the observed skews is cancelled out within a window of a few thousands bps. As seen in Figure 2b and d though skew diagrams display fluctuations, there is no structural change near the position of the ori . The fitted models are constant along CDS concatenates, highlighting that the transcription orientation of genes is a major determinant of strand biases, at the level of both base composition ( SCDSAC–GT ) and base order ( PCDSAC–GT ). 26,57 Analysis of 340 bacterial chromosomes with cumulative diagrams and linear regression models shows that both dinucleotide and relative abundance skews are prevalent features of bacterial genomes in general. The corresponding plots are provided in a web-page (see link to Additional Figures and Tables), along with tabulated descriptive statistics of the skew distributions within our collection. The form of our cumulative skew diagrams ranges from the characteristic V or inverted-V shapes, to heavily distorted curves with irregular peaks and troughs, in line with previously known skew patterns of bacterial genomes. 15,16 Overall inspection of dinucleotide and relative abundance skew diagrams shows that their patterns cannot be directly inferred from one another. When focusing on the linear regression models of relative abundance skews, strand-asymmetries of context-dependent substitutions seem to significantly correlate with replication- and CDS-associated biases in up to >50 and 80% of our collection, respectively ( Supplementary Table S1 ). 3.2 Strand biases of CDSs are species-specific The set of strand-symmetrised relative abundances ( <U+03C1> * <U+03A7><U+03A5> ), namely ‘genomic signatures’, have been used for phylogenetic reconstruction. 58 For a dinucleotide, XY, <U+03C1> * <U+03A7><U+03A5> = f * XY / f * X f* Y , where f * XY , f * X and f * Y are the frequencies of dinucleotide XY and mononucleotides X, Y, respectively, computed along the concatenate of the sequence with its reverse complement. 35,58 We assess whether strand biases of relative abundances, quantified by relative abundance skews, can also track the evolutionary path of divergent species. Based on pairwise comparisons of relative abundance skew profiles along CDSs, we construct the corresponding cladograms (see Methods section and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Then, we compare the skew-based trees to the species trees and obtain their percent topological similarity ( Fig. 3a ). a .

Boxplots of percent rank of similarity between chromosomes of the same organism, in terms of their skew distribution along their CDSs. a and b. Skews are grouped into three classes: mononucleotide skews ( VMONO ), dinucleotide skews ( VDI ), and relative abundance skews ( VRA ). The topological scores and the percent rank of similarity based on d -distances between genomic signatures are presented as a benchmark. c and d. Regression of the skews ( SCDSG-C and PCDSAG-CT ) in ‘low-coverage orthologs’ to the skews of the ‘remaining orthologs’. Each point represents a chromosome of our collection.

As seen in the corresponding boxplots, both strand-specific ( <U+03C1><U+03A7><U+03A5> - <U+03C1>Y'X' ) and symmetrised ( <U+03C1> * <U+03A7><U+03A5> ) versions of nearest-neighbour correlations are species-specific. For all taxonomic subdivisions the inferred topology largely agrees with the species phylogeny, with the resulting scores being higher than 72% in all cases except Actinobacteria and d-Proteobacteria ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Moreover, skew-based trees tend to be more accurate compared with genomic signature trees, as evidenced by their median scores. Thus, it can be argued that the strand bias of first-neighbour correlations constitute an idiosyncratic genomic feature that is linked to the evolutionary dynamics of the DNA strands.  We also present the topological scores of mono- and di-nucleotide skew-based trees ( Fig. 3a ). Base frequencies and base order are fused at the level of base doublets, and hence dinucleotide skews reflect the combined effect of mononucleotide and relative abundance strand-biases. As shown by the median scores, skews contain information that enables increasingly accurate phylogenetic reconstruction as we shift from base singlets to doublets and eventually to doublet relative abundances. To rule out the possibility that the observed skew similarities between different genomes are the result of CDS homology, we compare the skews of non-homologous parts of the same genome. We sort in ascending order all pairs of chromosomes according to the similarity of their skews, in terms of symmetric KL-divergence, as obtained by pairwise comparisons of the distribution of each of their variables, V MONO , V DI , V RA along the CDS concatenates. We focused on the bacteria which carry more than one chromosomes (a total of 26 in our collection; plasmids are excluded). In Figure 3b , we present the ranks of similarity between chromosomes that belong to the same organism (a total of 55 pairs). When comparing dinucleotide or relative abundance skews, the distributions of ranks are quite compact, while ranks corresponding to mononucleotide skews are more scattered. Yet in all cases the median values are higher than 98%. Since different chromosomes of the same organism share limited, if any, homologous regions, their high ranks of skew similarity cannot be attributed to sequence similarity.  Moreover, in each chromosome we distinguish between two separate groups of genes, on the basis of the abundance of their orthologs within a given phylum or class (‘low-coverage’ vs. ‘remaining’ orthologs). For each skew, a single value is computed along the coding strand of genes which belong to the same group. In Figure 3c and d we regress SCDSG-C and PCDSAG-CT of the ‘low-coverage’ orthologs on SCDSG-C and PCDSAG-CT of the ‘remaining’ ones. The slope and y-intercept are close to unity and zero, respectively, indicating that ‘low-coverage’ and ‘remaining’ orthologs exhibit highly similar patterns of SCDSG-C and PCDSAG-CT . Similar correlation patterns are detected for all skews ( Supplementary Figure S2 and Supplementary Table 3 ). We conclude that within a given chromosome CDSs have quite similar contribution on the overall CDS skews, irrespective of their evolutionary descent. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the correlation of skews with the evolutionary course of bacteria cannot be attributed to sequence divergence of CDSs originating from a shared ancestry. Regarding in particular relative abundance skews, we obtained clear indications that they reflect species-specific substitution strand-biases, which are context-dependent.3.3 The GC biased structure of genetic code imposes site-specific strand-asymmetries Skews can be effectively implemented in the analysis of evolutionary processes that distinguish between coding and transcribed strands, resulting in strand-biased substitutions. Here, we inquire site-specific biases in nucleotide distribution along CDSs. We compute the SCDSA-T and SCDSG-C at each codon site. Regarding third codon position, 4-fold (third-ff) and 2-fold (third-tf) sites are considered separately. For all chromosomes in our collection, we compute the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r ) 59 between SCDSG-C at a given codon site and the frequency of each codon, and plot the corresponding values in heatmaps ( Fig. 4a–d ).

ATG (start codon) and, in some cases, TGA (opal stop codon) are also found inside CDS, the first encoding for Methionine and the second for Tryptophane or Selenocysteine, and thus correlations of SCDSA-T and SCDSG-C with [ATG] and [TGA] appear in the heatmaps. The six-fold degenerate codons of Leucine and Arginine are labeled in the heatmaps. For further remarks see Supplementary Figure S4 . Codons used in calculations of skews at third 4- and 2-fold-degenerate sites are marked with ‘ * ’ and ‘•’, respectively. ‘start’, initiation codon; ‘stop’, termination codons.

Codons used in calculations of skews at third 4- and 2-fold-degenerate sites are marked with ‘ * ’ and ‘•’, respectively. ‘start’, initiation codon; ‘stop’, termination codons.  If the observed compositional asymmetries resulted primarily from synonymous codon usage, clear correlation patterns should appear when considering third-ff sites, where all substitutions are synonymous. 2 However, SCDSG-C at third-ff sites displays only weak correlation with codon frequencies. At the first, second, and the third-tf sites SCDSG-C is associated with codon frequencies in a way that distinguishes between A/T- and G/C-ending codons. Namely, at third-tf and first sites r is positive for A/T-ending codons and negative for G/C-ending codons, while the inverse holds true at second sites. These rather structured patterns, which are also evident in the case of SCDSA-T ( Supplementary Figure S4 ), are, prima facie , counterintuitive. Third-tf sites are susceptible only to GC-changing substitutions (A<U+2194>G or C<U+2194>T) without altering the encoding amino-acid. Only codons for Arg and Leu allow synonymous, GC-changing substitutions in both first and third position, while substitutions in the remaining first and all second sites are non-synonymous. If skews at the first, second, and the third-tf sites resulted primarily from selective constraints, they should be correlated with the frequencies of codons specifying particular amino-acids. 2 Instead, their values respond to the GC% of the third codon sites. In the evolutionary timescale, GC% changes much faster at third than first and second codon sites, and thus more accurately reflects genome-wide mutational biases towards a particular GC content. 60 We produce a set of artificial sequences with their GC content ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, with a step of 0.005 ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Then, we compute Pearson’s r between site-specific skews and codon frequencies, as derived from the artificial sequences. Note that our model is not built to predict the codon usage actually observed in bacterial genomes. Instead, it is aimed to assess whether there is a causal link between strand asymmetries in CDSs and the structure of genetic code, driven by GC content variability, as implied by the heatmaps in Figure 4b–d . The parameters  n i ,  R iGC and  R iAT are symmetric with respect to the complementary nucleotide bases and do not account for base order within codons ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Thus, any compositional asymmetries in the produced artificial sequences and their correlation with codon usage, can only be attributed to the partition of codons into synonymous groups and the GC varibility within these groups.  The corresponding heatmaps show no significant correlation between skews at third-ff sites and codon usage, but largely reproduce the correlation patterns detected in our genomic dataset when considering skews at third-tf sites (cf. Figure 4d,e ), first and second sites (cf. Supplementary Figure S4 e–p). Namely, at third-tf and first sites of the artificial sequences SCDSA-T and SCDSG-C increase with A/T-ending codons and counter to G/C-ending ones. The correlation is reversed at second codon sites of these sequences ( Supplementary Figure S4 n and p). The only marked discrepancy between genomic data and our model regards SCDSA-T at second codon sites, where the inverse pattern of correlation is detected (cf. Supplementary Figure S4 m and n). Among other factors, this discrepancy can be attributed to selective pressures, which have been previously associated with the emergence of atypical SCDSA-T patterns. 16 Our model suggests that given the GC bias of synonymous codons (  R iGC and  R iAT ) the interspecies variation of GC content suffices to yield the observed correlations between codon usage and site-specific skews along CDSs. To further test our argument, we consider a null-hypothesis model, in which Pi=(GC)ni(1-GC)(3-ni) , and thus synonymous-codon GC biases (  R iGC and  R iAT ) are not accounted for. Under this null-model the previously observed patterns collapse ( Fig. 4f ), indicating that synonymous-codon GC biases are indeed a decisive factor linking skews to codon usage.  GC mutational biases tailored with the structure of the genetic code can drastically modulate the nucleotide and codon composition of CDSs; 65,66 and references given therein. Here we presented evidence that the synonymous-codon GC biases along with GC content variability among genomes, attributed to directional mutation pressure, though not per se strand-biased, can lead to asymmetries between coding and transcribed strand. This holds true even when selection of specific codons and amino-acids is not accounted for. This is more prominent at the first, second, and the third-tf sites, where such asymmetries are inherently imposed by the genetic code. Our findings imply that, given the overall GC content of the genome, the partition of codons into synonymous groups provides the ground for an a priori estimation of codon site-specific skews. Such skews correspond to an uneven baseline distribution of nucleotides among different codon sites, which should be considered when estimating the expected number of substitutions per site in comparative genomic analysis.  As discussed earlier and shown in Figure 4a , in third-ff sites strand asymmetries exhibit weak correlations with codon usage. Subsequently, we address the role of specific molecular systems, which may induce replication- and transcription-associated biases, in shaping third-ff asymmetries. 3.4 Transcription-coupled repair and PolIII a-subunit isoforms induce whole-genome mutational biasesIntra-strand asymmetries provide valuable insight into molecular processes with distinct modes of action on each DNA strand. We analyse the distribution of skews in our genomic dataset to infer substitution asymmetries related to two such processes, namely transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and DNA replication. In the following analysis, all comparisons of skew distributions are performed using the two-tailed Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Bacteria with active TCR possess homologs of the mfd gene, which codes for the transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF). 67 To assess the effect of TCR on mutational biases, we compare the distribution of transcription-associated (Trs) skews in relation to the existence of the mfd gene (TCR + : mfd present, TCR - : mfd absent). As seen in Table 1A , the TCR +  group shows a significantly different STrsA-T distribution compared with the TCR -  one ( P- value < 10 -5 ). Moreover, three out of six relative abundance skews ( PTrsGG-CC , PTrsAA-TT , and PTrsAC-GT ) strongly correlate with the presence of mfd ( P- value < 10 -7 ), while there is also a moderate differentiation of PTrsGA-TC distribution in TCR +  and TCR -  bacteria ( P- value < 0.05). Analysis of skew distributions in relation to TCR and PolIII a-subunit For each group of genomes the median skew values are provided. We pairwise compare the skew distributions among the considered genome groups. The p -values for the two-tailed Wilcoxon’s rank sum tests conducted denote the statistical significance of their difference. —, P -value = 0.05; *,0.05 > P -value = 0.01; **, 0.01 > P -value = 0.001; ***, P -value < 0.001.

We pairwise compare the skew distributions among the considered genome groups.

TCR specifically targets lesions on the transcribed strand, 68 enhancing the bias of TAM, such as C<U+2192>T transitions, towards the coding strand. 26,69,70 Skew analysis captures this strand-bias, with the distribution of STrsA-T (TCR + ) being shifted to the left of STrsA-T (TCR - ) distribution, in accordance with an excess of C<U+2192>T over G<U+2192>A substitutions on the coding strand. However, there is no correlation of STrsG-C with TCR ( P- value = 0.239), indicating that this strand-bias does not originate solely from C<U+2192>T asymmetries, in line with 21 . The rates of TAM are known to be context-dependent, with C<U+2192>T being greatly accelerated when C occurs in pyrimidine dimers. 71 This may lead to the observed correlation of mfd with PTrsGG-CC and possibly with PTrsAA-TT . However, as seen in the case of PTrsAC-GT , mfd also strongly correlates with relative abundance skews of dinucleotides that cannot form pyrimidine dimers. Thus, the efficiency of TCR may itself depend on sequence context.  We extend our analysis to replication-induced substitution asymmetries. 9 In bacteria, both DNA strands are synthesized by the a -subunit dimer of DNA PolIII. 72 We partition our genomic dataset into three groups, according to the dimeric combination of their a -subunit isoforms: dnaE (homodimer of DnaE1), dnaE2 (heterodimer of DnaE1 with DnaE2) and polC (heterodimer of PolC with either DnaE1 or DnaE3). 62 Note that the polC group is comprised of all Firmicutes and Tenericutes of our collection.  In a previous study 73 no correlation was found between skews and a-subunit isoforms. There, however, bacteria were grouped in relation to the existence of pol C only, while dna E2 was not accounted for. Table 1B shows that replication-associated (Rep) skews are strongly correlated to the grouping scheme we employ. Both SRepA-T and SRepG-C are distinctively distributed among the three groups ( P- value « 10 -4 ). Relative abundance skews also significantly correlate with the type of a -subunit dimers (i.e. PTrsAA-TT , PTrsGG-CC , PTrsAC-GT ). Moreover, PolC largely determines the sign of SRepA-T (positive; see also 23 ), PRepGG-CC and PRepAA-TT (both negative). The other skews are of the same sign in all three groups.  When present, PolC replicates the leading strand, 74 while DnaE2 performs SOS-induced translesion synthesis. 75,76 Both PolC and DnaE2 form heterodimers whose components possess distinct nucleotide incorporation and proofreading activities. Our results reveal that such asymmetries of a-subunit induce specific strand-biased substitutions on a genome-wide scale. In many cases these biases are neighbour-dependent, as indicated by relative abundance skews ( PRepAA-TT , PRepGG-CC , PRepAC-GT ). In the dnaE group the replication of both strands is catalyzed by the same a-subunit isoform. Thus, the observed skews should be attributed to the intrinsic asymmetries of the replication fork. 7 Analysis of skew distribution can also provide useful information about molecular processes, besides replication and transcription, which are not yet determined to act in a strand-specific manner. Since we detect no significant correlation between STrsG-C and TCR, we compare the distribution of STrsG-C in relation to other DNA repair systems ( Supplementary Tables S5 and S6 ). We consider direct reversal of DNA damage, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair and recombination repair pathways. In 7 out of 20 cases studied, we detect a statistically significant correlation (adjusted P -value < 0.01, see Supplementary Table S7 ) between STrsG-C and specific DNA repair systems. The presence of these systems is linked to a shift of the STrsG-C distribution from lower to higher (signed) values, in a remarkably uniform way, indicating an inversion of mutational bias when the corresponding repair systems are active. 4. ConclusionsStrand-asymmetries are deeply rooted into DNA evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide solid evidence that nearest-neighbour preferences are a strand-biased feature of bacterial genomes. The relative abundance skews, which we herein introduce, quantify these biases to assess strand-asymmetries in context-dependent substitutions.We show that skews along CDSs are distinct among different species but similar between genes of the same organism. Moreover, relative abundance skews are more strongly correlated with species phylogeny, even when compared with genomic signatures. Hence, CDS-associated substitution asymmetries do not emanate from evolutionary trends which are universal across bacteria, but are species-specific.Site-specific and context-dependent skew analysis facilitates the inquiry about the origin of certain substitution asymmetries. When CDSs are subjected to mutational bias towards a particular GC content, the structure of the genetic code imposes site-specific strand-biases on nucleotide substitutions. This leads to baseline position-dependent strand-asymmetries that should be taken into account when considering the effect of directional mutation and purifying selection on biases in CDSs’ composition. Furthermore, the molecular machinery of transcription and replication are implicated in strand-asymmetries. TCR results in substitution biases towards coding strands, and our skew analysis efficiently captures these asymmetries. The isoforms of the PolIII a -subunit introduce replication errors at different rates on each DNA strand. Our results indicate that these biases are prevalent enough to induce whole-genome substitution asymmetries, both context-dependent and -independent.

Introduction Fabaceae, or legumes, account for ~27% of the world’s primary crop production. The capacity of most legumes to form nitrogen fixing nodules with rhizobia underlies their importance as a source of protein for human and animal diet and of nitrogen in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. 1 Among the 20,000 legume species, around 14,000 fall into the Papilionoideae subfamily that is divided into four main clades Genistoids, Dalbergioids, Phaseoloids and Galegoids ( Fig. 1 ). 7 Phylogeny of the Papilionoid lineage and evolution of the symbiotic infection process. The tree is a simplified representation with triangle representing the major clades and the two subclades of the Galegoids: the Robinoids and the plastid DNA inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC). Known divergence times are indicated in MYA (million years ago) for some nodes (circles) and notable species are listed for each clade. Symbiotic infection processes encountered in the different clades are reported, excepted for the basal clades for which occurrence of nodulation is restricted to few understudied species. Note that Aeschynomene is the only legume genus where a Nod-independent symbiotic infection process (*NI*) has been reported for several species, including A. evenia . Phylogeny and drawings are adaptations, date estimates and nodulation properties come from previous publications. 2-,6 Phylogeny of the Papilionoid lineage and evolution of the symbiotic infection process.

Phylogeny and drawings are adaptations, date estimates and nodulation properties come from previous publications. 2-,6 To advance in the understanding of how legumes have evolved to nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia, two model species belonging to the Galegoid clade and with favorable genetic attributes, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus , have been extensively studied. This study has revealed a sophisticated symbiotic process that is triggered by the recognition of rhizobial signal molecules called Nod factors (NF) and that involves both the formation of an infection thread guiding the bacteria inside the root and a distant induction of a nodule primordium. Furthermore, the genetic dissection of the nodulation process has allowed the identification and elucidation of the role of many genes that are essential for the different steps of nodule development, some of them being also involved in mycorrhizal symbiosis. 8 Such mechanisms are likely to be highly conserved in the Phaseolid and Galegoid clades that share similar symbiotic infection and nodule organogenesis processes ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, since most of the legumes used as crops are members of the Phaseoloids and Galegoids, genetic and genomic studies, including genome sequencing and comparative genomics, have greatly advanced in these two clades. 9–17 Conversely, the Genistoid and the Dalbergioid clades, which are more basal in their divergence within the Papilionoideae, have lagged far behind, even though they contain important crop legumes such as the genistoid lupine ( Lupinus angustifolius ) and the dalbergioid peanut ( Arachis hypogaea ). This is partly due to the large and complex nature of their genomes that makes their study challenging. Hence, in the case of peanut, which is a recent allotetraploid species, the choice was made to sequence first the genomes of its two diploid progenitors, Arachis duranensis and A. ipaensis . 18 Similarly, genistoid and dalbergioid legumes have been understudied for their symbiotic properties although they display a distinct infection process that is initiated in an intercellular fashion and by the formation of nodules that originate directly from dividing infected cells ( Fig. 1 ). 2 But most surprisingly, in some Aeschynomene species, which are phylogenetically related to Arachis , an unconventional symbiotic process has also been described where some Bradyrhizobium strains are able to form nodules in the absence of NF synthesis ( Fig. 1 ). 19 Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of this NF-independent process would bring important insights on the evolution of rhizobium-legume symbiosis. 20 For this purpose, Aeschynomene evenia was proposed as a new model legume because of its advantageous genetic and developmental characteristics for molecular genetics. 21,22 To provide insights into the symbiotic gene content and on the structure of the NF-independent A. evenia genome, we undertook the development of a gene-based genetic map. RNAseq data obtained for each parental line were mined for symbiotic gene discovery and molecular marker development. These markers were used to genotype a F 2 mapping population and construct a high-density genetic map that was subjected to comparative analysis with the Arachis duranensis and A. ipaensis genomes. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material, culture, crossing and observation Seed germination, plant culture and hybridizations were performed as indicated. 21 To develop the mapping population, individual seeds of the A. evenia accessions CIAT8232 (Brazil) and CIAT22838 (Malawi) obtained from CIAT (Colombia) were selfed three times to generate inbred lines and then crossed manually. The hybrid nature of the F 1 plants was confirmed with molecular markers as described. 22 Two F 1 plants obtained by bi-directional hybridizations were selfed to develop the F 2 mapping population in greenhouse. For pollen viability analysis, buds were fixed in Carnoy’s fixative prior to anthesis, when pollen was mature but anthers non-dehiscent, and then stained using a simplified method of the Alexander’s stain as detailed. 3 Pollen viability was scored under the light microscope for at least three flowers per plant by counting aborted pollen grains, which stained pale turquoise blue and nonaborted pollen grains, which stained dark blue or purple. 2.2 DNA and RNA isolation Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using the CTAB method with the addition of ß-mercaptoethanol 2% and PVPP 2% to the CTAB solution in order to limit polysaccharides and polyphenols co-extraction. 21 DNA quality and quantity were evaluated in 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometer before DNA normalization to a concentration of 10 ng/µl.  For RNA extractions, tissue samples were collected from in vitro cultured plants: roots and leaves on 7-days old un-inoculated plants, nodules at 4, 7 and 14-days after inoculation with the Bradyrhizobium strain ORS278. Total RNA was extracted using the SV total RNA Isolation System (Promega) excepted for leaves for which RNA was extracted using a CTAB protocol. 23 RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and its quality verified using a 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA Nanochip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For each parental line, a total of 12 µg of RNA was pooled equally from the five tissues for Illumina library construction. 2.3 Development of Illumina transcriptomes Two mRNA libraries were built and sequenced in one lane as described. 24 The Illumina paired-end sequencing technology generated 2× 100 bp independent reads from the 200 bp insert libraries. RNA-seq data were processed for the de novo transcriptome assemblies using the Velvet 1.2.07 and CAP3 08/06/13 softwares and orthologous relationships between contigs of the two transcriptome assemblies were identified by best reciprocal hit search. To evaluate the quality of the assembly, all usable reads were realigned to the contigs using BWA-MEM 0.7.12-r1039 and SAMtools idxstats 1.1. To assess the depth of gene coverage through comparative genome analysis, ORFs were searched in A. evenia transcripts with TransDcoder_r20140704 and used for BLASTX alignment ( E value < 10 -20 ) with Blastall 2.2.26 onto the protein database of A. duranensis (Araip.V14167.a1.M1.peptide.fa file downloaded from www.peanut.org ). Raw Illumina sequence data have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the accession numbers SRR3276128 and SRR3285082, for the CIAT8232 and CIAT22838 lines respectively. 2.4 Sequence search and comparison Symbiotic gene sequences were obtained from M. truncatula and L. japonicus by searching in the NCBI database. These sequences were used to find orthologous unigenes in an A. evenia local database developed with a Galaxy work bench (INRA, Toulouse, France) ( https://bbric-pipelines.toulouse.inra.fr/galaxy/ ) and containing the CIAT8232 and CIAT22838 transcriptome data ( Supplementary Tables S1, S3 ; Supplementary Data ).  For estimation of divergence time, single-copy genes identified in the CIAT8232 and CIAT22838 transcriptomes were used to obtain orthologous sequences for A. evenia IRLFL6945 from its transcriptome database ( http://esttik.cirad.fr ) and for A. duranensis and A. ipaensis from their genome sequence database ( http://peanutbase.org/ ) ( Supplementary Table S5 ). Coding sequences were cropped, aligned and used to calculate Ks values with the DnaSP 5.10 software ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Divergence times were obtained based on a simple molecular clock assumption and by using the previously known ~49 MYA divergence time estimate between Aeschynomene and Arachis . 62.5 SSR and INDEL genotyping Detection of microsatellites in the transcriptome data were performed using the SPUTNIK software by searching for di- to hexanucleotide SSRs with a minimum of three to six repetitions depending on the motifs. Orthologous sequences in the two transcriptome assemblies comprising different lengths of the same SSR motif, with a contig length over 500 nt and with at least 50 nt surrounding the SSR motifs were selected as in silico polymorphic SSRs ( Supplementary Table S1 ). For specific gene mapping, SSR and INDELs were searched by sequence comparison from the two transcriptomes. Primer pairs were designed using Primer3 with tree parameters: (i) a primer length of 20 bp with an annealing temperature of 55 °C, (ii) three ranges of PCR product size of 90–120, 150–180 and 220–250 bp, (iii) the addition of a 5'-end M13 tail (5'-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3') on the forward primer ( Supplementary Table S2 ). SSR markers were checked for PCR-amplification and co-dominant behavior, organized in 12-SSR multiplexes by combining both the three ranges of fragment sizes and the four fluorochromes (FAM, VIC, NED and PET), and then used to genotype the F 2 mapping population as described. 252.6 SNP genotyping To detect single nucleotide polymorphisms for a set of target genes, sequences of orthologous contigs identified in the two transcriptome datasets were aligned with the MUSCLE program ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Positions of the SNPs were determined by examining the intron/exon structure of orthologous genes in Arachis ( http://peanutbase.org/ ). Whenever necessary, additional SNPs were searched by intron sequencing. Up to three SNPs were selected for each target gene and flanking sequences 50 bp both upstream and downstream each target SNP were sent to KBioscience for primer design ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Genotyping of the F 2 mapping population was performed with the KASP genotyping chemistry (KBioscience Ltd., Hoddesdon, UK) on Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Arrays using the BioMark HD system (Fluidigm Corp, San Francisco, CA). On the basis of obtained fluorescence, allele call data were viewed graphically as a scatter plot for each marker assayed by using Fluidigm SNP Genotyping Analysis software and checked manually. 2.7 Genetic map construction Linkage analysis was performed on segregated genotypic data from the F 2 mapping population using JoinMap® version 4 (Plant Research International BV, Wageningen, Netherlands). The marker loci were attributed to linkage groups using the JoinMap® grouping module with a logarithm of odds (LOD) scores of 6.0. Marker order and genetic distance (in cM) were calculated using a regression mapping algorithm with the following parameters: Kosambi’s mapping function, recombination frequency =0.40, and LOD threshold of 1.0 ( Supplementary Table S6 ). The segregation data were tested for deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio using a Chi-square test. LG numbering and orientation were attributed to best fit the A. duranensis and A. ipaensis chromosomes. 2.8 Comparative genomics Gene sequences underlying the molecular marker loci assigned to the linkage map were blasted against the A. duranensis and A. ipaensis genome sequences ( http://peanutbase.org/ ) to detect significant matches at minimum threshold E values < 10 -60 ( Supplementary Table S6 ). For the purpose of graphic preparation, cM distance on the A. evenia linkage groups were scaled by factors calculated on the basis of the genome size of A. ipaensis , to provide matching chromosomal lengths in base pairs. The graphical comparative maps were drawn using the Circos program ( http://circos.ca/ ) and the SpiderMap software (JF Rami, unpublished). 3. Results and discussion3.1 Selection of parental genotypes to develop a mapping population The A. evenia species was proposed as a new model legume to investigate the evolution of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis because it possesses a number of interesting characteristics for both classical and molecular genetics. 21,22 Key attributes of A. evenia include diploidy (2 n  = 2× = 20), self-pollination, a small genome for a legume, a short growth cycle and a high level of diversity. In addition it is efficiently nodulated by the well-characterized strains Bradyrhizobium ORS278 and ORS285 and it can be transformed using the hairy root system. First nodulation studies were performed on the cultivar IRFL6945 belonging to the A. evenia ssp. serrulata . 21 But subsequent analysis of the intra-specific diversity revealed that A. evenia ssp. evenia is more appropriate due to a smaller genome size (415 vs 465 Mb) and the presence of genotypes with a more rapid reproductive cycle and a non-branching habit that facilitate plant management ( Fig. 2A,B ). 22 We made use of this knowledge to select from within the subspecies evenia var. evenia the genotype Mbao CIAT22838, which displays these advantageous characteristics, as the reference genotype. Its nodulation properties were previously shown to be representative of the species with ~11nodules/plant, and its ability to be transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes was found to be similar to what was described for the line IRLF6945 with a 60% root transformation rate and subsequent 90% nodulation rate upon inoculation with Bradyrhizobium ORS278. 21 Even though A. evenia is a self-pollinated plant and was previously shown to be predominantly homozygous, a single seed from the reference genotype was selfed three times to ensure high homozygosity.  Differentiation within the A. evenia species and its use for genomic and genetic studies.

Bars = 5 mm.  The establishment of a mapping population required the identification of a second parent that has favorable polymorphism while the resulting F 2 population should not have developmental and genetic abnormalities. Characterization of the diversity in A. evenia had previously revealed that the genetic polymorphism was the highest between the subspecies evenia and serrulata but that inter-subspecies crosses led to sterile F 1 hybrids. Conversely, intra-subspecific hybridizations were shown to generate fully fertile F 1 progenies. 22 Therefore, to maximize genetic polymorphism, the genotype Bahia CIAT8232 that belongs to the subspecies evenia var. pauciciliata and that presents a distinct geographic origin (African for Mbao versus American for Bahia) was developed as an inbred line and used as the second mapping parent ( Fig. 2A ). The Mbao and Bahia genotypes present a similar DNA content (415 and 405 Mb, respectively) but they were shown to display a 32% SSR polymorphism. 22 This situation is similar to the one observed in Medicago truncatula with the two mapping parents Jemalong and DZA315.16 and between three ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana , indicating it is convenient for generating genetic maps. 26 In addition, the two genotypes display phenotypic differences making them readily distinguishable such as the branching habit, the timing of flower openings and the presence of a dark throat on the upper petal ( Fig. 2B ).  Artificial hybridizations were performed using the genotype Mbao CIAT22838 as female and male alternatively and producing F 1A and F 1B progenies respectively. These F 1 plants showed hybrid vigor, intermediate flower characteristics (opening time and shape) and were self-fertile ( Fig. 2B ). In particular, they displayed equivalent pod set (Bahia: 8.6 ± 0.9, Mbao: 8.2 ± 1, F 1 : 8.8 ± 1.1 seeds/pod). The resulting F 2A and F 2B offsprings had no albino or dwarf individuals. Altogether, this suggested that Bahia CIAT8232 was a suitable crossing partner to Mbao CIAT22838 and that the obtained F 2 offsprings could be used as mapping population to develop a genetic map. 3.2 Transcriptome sequencing for identification of symbiotic genes and genetic markers High-throughput transcriptomic sequencing allows generating a large transcript sequence dataset for gene discovery and development of molecular markers that serve for gene-based map construction. To be able to achieve a broad survey of genes associated with symbiosis, RNA was extracted and pooled from various organs: roots, leaves and nodules at 4, 7 and 14-dpi. In addition, to increase the efficiency of molecular marker development by prior in silico polymorphic analysis, a RNA library was developed for each parental genotype.  Using Illumina paired-end sequencing and after stringent quality check of the raw data, ~72 million reads were kept for the Mbao genotype and ~66 million for the Bahia genotype. Based on these high-quality reads, a total of 51,763 and 52,648 contigs were assembled respectively, with a common N50 of 1,800 bp and a consistent contig size distribution ( Table 1 ). This indicated that a similar transcript content was obtained for both mapping parents. Furthermore, realignment of all the usable reads to the contigs revealed that ~35,000 contigs were remapped by more than 100 reads and, among them, ~24,500 contigs were realigned with more than 500 reads, suggesting the contigs were well overlapped by the sequencing reads ( Fig. 3A ). A. evenia being a member of the Dalbergioid clade along with the recently sequenced A. duranensis and A. ipaensis , their genomic data could be also used to assess the quality and coverage of the assembled transcriptomes. 22 Since A. duranensis has not experienced the local gene duplications evidenced for A. ipaensis , the former species was better suited for this purpose. Thus, comparative analysis revealed that 60% of total contigs (~31,850) and 83% of contigs over 500 bp in length (~26,378) had BLAST matches ( E -value < 10 -5 ) onto the ~36,700 predicted genes in the A. duranensis genome ( Fig. 3B ). In addition, plotting the contigs onto top-hit homologous coding sequences of A. duranensis ( E -value < 10 -30 ) indicated a high proportion of genes with complete coding sequence ( Fig. 3C ). Altogether, these data suggested that a comprehensive gene capture was achieved for A. evenia .  Assessment of assembly quality and gene coverage for the Illumina transcriptomes.

Overview of the sequencing and assemblyOverview of the sequencing and assembly To determine which symbiotic genes can be identified in A. evenia , a BLAST search was performed in the Bahia and Mbao transcriptomes using the sequence of symbiotic genes characterized in the two model legumes M. truncatula and L. japonicus . 8,27–33 This allowed the identification of a single sequence in A. evenia for 36 out of 47 symbiotic genes analysed, for which the putative orthology was checked by reciprocal BLAST and sequence alignment ( Fig. 4 ; Files S1, S2). These genes completely covered the different steps of the nodulation process: Nod signaling, activation and regulation of transcription, nodule organogenesis and regulation of nodulation ( Fig. 4 ). This coverage suggested that these steps were conserved in A. evenia , but it could not be excluded that some of these genes were only involved in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis or in other biological processes. So far, only the A. evenia SYMRK , CCaMK , CRE1 and DNF1 orthologs were effectively demonstrated to play a role in nodulation. 34,35 Simplified model for the symbiotic signaling pathway in legumes. Symbiotic genes identified in M. truncatula and L. japonicus are listed and classified in main symbiotic functions. 8,27-33 Putative orthologs were searched in the Illumina transcriptome of the two mapping parents.

Those that could not be identified are between parentheses. Genes highlighted in bold characters are those which were demonstrated to be involved in the Nod-independent nodulation process in A. evenia . 33,34 Interestingly, for some other symbiotic genes, transcripts were not detected despite the use of root and nodule materials for the transcriptomes. Missing genes are involved in three symbiotic processes: bacterial recognition (i.e. LYK3 and LYR3 ), rhizobial infection (i.e. ANN1 , EPR3 , FLOT and RPG ) as well as nodule functioning and immunity (i.e. DNF2 , FEN1 , SUNERGOS1 , SymCRK and VAG1 ) ( Fig. 4 ). In the absence of genomic data for A. evenia , it was not possible to determine whether these genes were absent, not expressed or missed when mining the transcriptome data. But, it is worth noting that the concerned genes are involved in symbiotic processes that present sharp differences between A. evenia , M. truncatula and L. japonicus ( Fig. 1 ). 2,19 As a consequence, these first observations represented important cues to further investigate the evolution of rhizobial symbiosis.  To allow the development of molecular markers, the Bahia and Mbao transcriptomes were searched for microsatellites. These were subsequently analysed for in silico polymorphism by comparing the orthologous SSR-containing contigs of the two parental genotypes and filtered to allow primer design on flanking sequences. 1,500 microsatellites complying with these criteria were identified, the most abundant type of repeat motif being tri-nucleotides (46.4%), followed by di-nucleotides (35.9%) ( Table 2 ). 500 SSR sites were selected for primer design and used for assessment of the polymorphism between the two parental genotypes and the F 1 progeny by capillary sequencing. Of the 412 successfully amplified SSRs, 335 (81%) were co-dominant, 50 (12%) were dominant and 27 (7%) were not polymorphic. Hence, thanks to the in silico analysis, the efficiency of polymorphic SSR development was increased by 2.5-fold compared to previous work with no prior filtering of the genic SSR tested on the same Bahia and Mbao genotypes. 22 Finally, a set of 318 co-dominant SSR markers was retained for the genotyping of the F 2 mapping population ( Supplementary Tables S1, S2 ). Distribution of repeat types and number of repeats within the Mbao libraryDistribution of repeat types and number of repeats within the Mbao library In order to map the symbiotic genes, polymorphisms were also searched for by comparing the orthologous sequences from the two parental genotypes and were converted into molecular markers. When no polymorphic SSR and no INDEL could be detected, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) was used instead for KASP assay design ( Supplementary Tables S1–S4 ). Subsequently, at least one molecular marker could be satisfactorily developed for each identified symbiotic gene, except for two genes, SEN1 and RSD , that lack of polymorphism. A few additional markers were also used, notably to locate the 5S and 45S loci that were previously identified on A. evenia chromosomes by cytogenetics ( Supplementary Tables S1, S2 ). 213.3 Construction of the genetic map and mapping of symbiotic genes 110 F 2A and the 110 F 2B individuals, which were obtained by bi-directional crossings of the Bahia and Mbao genotypes, formed the mapping population. DNAs were extracted from the 220 F 2 individuals and were genotyped for the selected 318 SSR markers by capillary sequencing. Multiplexes of 12 SSR markers were chosen so as to combine both three ranges of fragment sizes and four fluorochromes (FAM, VIC, NED and PET). 46 additional markers comprising SSRs, INDELs and SNPs, which target notable putative symbiotic genes, were also used for genotyping by capillary sequencing or KASPAR technology. This genotyping generated a matrix with <0.6% of missing data for the 364 co-dominant markers used.  The A. evenia genetic map was built using the JOINMAP software with a minimum LOD score value of 6. The markers were assembled into 10 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome set of A. evenia (2 n  = 20). Interestingly, no marker remained unlinked and no linkage group could be split by increasing the LOD score value up to a LOD of 15. In addition, manual checking of the marker positions using color-mapping revealed no discrepancy in the genotyping data, thus corroborating the robustness of the 10 linkage groups obtained. They were thus numbered AeLG1 to AeLG10 and orientated as explained below ( Fig. 5 ).  Genetic map of Aeschynomene evenia . The genetic map based on F2 mapping population CIAT22838 × CIAT8232 is comprised of 364 gene based markers including SSR, INDEL and SNP (KASP) markers. The ten linkage groups are designated as AeLG1-AeLG10. The code to the right of the linkage groups refers to the marker or symbiotic gene name. The numbers to the left of the linkage groups refers to the genetic distances (Kosambi cM) from the top.  Genetic map of Aeschynomene evenia .

The ten linkage groups are designated as AeLG1-AeLG10. The code to the right of the linkage groups refers to the marker or symbiotic gene name. The numbers to the left of the linkage groups refers to the genetic distances (Kosambi cM) from the top.  The resulting genetic map spans 1,036 Kosambi cM, with an average of 400 kb/cM. The 10 linkage groups have different genetic sizes ranging from 82 to 130.8 cM and contained 13–49 markers ( Table 3 ). This leads to average distances between two adjacent markers varying from 2.6 to 7.5 cM but with maximum interval sizes per linkage group ranging from 10.7 to 25.1 cM ( Table 3 ). This situation is reminiscent to what has been already observed in Vigna unguiculata and Lens culinaris for which genetic maps were also developed with gene-based markers. 36,37 The gaps have been proposed to correspond to gene-poor regions or to recombination hotspots. In addition, mapping of the 5S and 45S rDNA loci further enabled distinguishing two linkage groups. Thus the 5S rDNA locus was found to locate on linkage group AeLG8 with a central position (at 55.6 cM on total 96.2 cM length) that is in accordance with the proximal localization previously observed on metaphase chromosomes by GISH. 21 Conversely, two 45S rDNA loci were shown to locate to in secondary constrictions of satellite chromosomes. 21 Sequence polymorphism for the ITS region allowed mapping only one of the two loci on the upper part of the linkage group AeLG10 (at 19.4 cM on a total 82 cM length) ( Fig. 5 ). 22 Finally, gene-specific markers corresponding to symbiotic genes were found to be distributed in all but one (AeLG2) linkage groups, with AeLG5, AeLG6, AeLG7 and AeLG9 containing the majority of them ( Fig. 5 ).  Characteristics of the Aeschynomene evenia genetic map  Characteristics of the Aeschynomene evenia genetic map  Although almost all markers complied with the 1:2:1 expected Mendelian ratio for co-dominant genetic markers, two regions of segregation distortion were observed ( Table 3 , Fig. 6A ). The AeLG2 RSD comprised up to 10 markers covering a map distance of up 70 cM and the AeLG9 RSD contained 11 markers (among which the symbiotic NSP1 and EFD genes) distributed over 45 cM, altogether representing 10% of the genetic map. In both cases, there was a strong overrepresentation of the Bahia allele and a near complete disappearance of the Mbao allele where the distortion culminated, whereas the proportion of heterozygotes remained unaltered. Judged from these skewed genotypic frequencies, a strong selection in favor of the Bahia alleles occurs at these RSD.  Segregation distortion and pollen viability of F1 hybrids.

Distortions can be caused by chromosomal structural rearrangements, differences in DNA content, gene incompatibilities or deleterious recessive alleles. Inversion or translocation events have been shown to be the cause of distortions in genetic maps of other legume such as M. truncatula , L. japonicus and L. culinaris . 13,26,38–41 Such events are more likely to occur when performing interspecific crosses than when using related genotypes, but one cannot exclude that a chromosomal rearrangement occurred within the subspecies evenia to which both the Bahia and Mbao genotypes belong. In addition, even if they display a similar overall DNA content, this DNA content may not be identical in the two RSD regions. Comparison of the genotypic data for the F 2A and F 2B mapping populations, revealed similar allele skewing in the two RSD regions, indicating that the observed distortions were independent of maternal and paternal effects. However, pollen viability analysis showed that the F 1 progeny contained ~38% aborted pollen in contrast to the Bahia and Mbao parental genotypes that showed more than 99% pollen viability ( Fig. 6B,C ). This F 1 semisterility may account for the observed skewed genetic frequencies, as it has been reported for some M. truncatula crosses. 38 Although, this RSD can alter genetic distances, it does not compromise marker ordering in the SDR regions. 3.4  Comparative analysis with Arachis With the aim of fostering genomic and symbiotic comparative analysis, we wanted to further our knowledge of the genetic differentiation in A. evenia and of the evolution within the Dalbergioid clade that contains Aeschynomene and Arachis . A ~49 MYA divergence of Aeschynomene and Arachis was previously estimated from chloroplast gene phylogenies ( Fig 2A ). 6 Using this date for calibration and assuming a simple molecular clock, we made a rough estimate for the divergence times between different A. evenia genotypes and between the two Arachis ancestral species of peanut. The coding reading frame of seven single-copy nuclear genes was obtained from the transcript databases available for A. evenia genotypes Bahia (CIAT8232), Goias (IRFL6945) and Mbao (CIAT22838) and their Arachis orthologs in the genome sequences of A. duranensis and A. ipaensis ( Fig 2A , Table 4 , Supplementary Table S5 ). Synonymous substitution rates (Ks) were calculated for binned values and an average mutation rate of 5.34 × 10 -3 substitutions/synonymous site/Mya was obtained by using the 49 MYA value for the Aeschynomene – Arachis divergence. 6 Estimation of divergence times between Aeschynomene and Arachis genomes  *Average divergence rate obtained by using the known 49 MYA divergence time between Aeschynomene and Arachis . 6 Numbers in bold are inferred values.  Estimation of divergence times between Aeschynomene and Arachis genomes  *Average divergence rate obtained by using the known 49 MYA divergence time between Aeschynomene and Arachis . 6 Numbers in bold are inferred values.  This enabled an estimate of divergence time between the two mapping parents that belong to A. evenia ssp. evenia var. evenia and var. pauciciliata at ~0.4 Mya, reflecting both the low difference observed in polymorphism and the cross-compatibility between the two varieties. 22 In contrast, a much older divergence time of ~3.3 Mya was deduced for A. evenia ssp. evenia – A. evenia ssp. serrulata . This is in agreement with the pronounced genetic differentiation of the two A. evenia subspecies evidenced by the difficulty of making successful crosses and the almost completely sterile hybrids. 22 This divergence time is similar to the ~3.5 Mya obtained for A. duranensis – A. ipaensis , which are genetically isolated, thus supporting the idea that the two A. evenia subspecies are at the final stage of the speciation process. Interestingly, the value calculated for the Arachis species couple is in accordance with other estimates (2.1–3.5 Mya). 18,42 Therefore, our approach seems to be valid to provide a timeframe for A. evenia evolution.  Several studies have undertaken comparative genomics within the Papilionoids revealing that the degree of synteny is correlated with phylogenetic distance of the legume species. 9–17 The first glimpses of genome evolution within the Dalbergioid clade were only recently obtained by the genome sequencing of the two putative genome donors of peanut. This revealed a mostly one-to-one correspondence between the two species, with the genome of A. duranensis , but not of A. ipaensis , having undergone several major rearrangements. 22 To perform the Aeschynomene-Arachis genome comparison, we made use of the gene-based nature of the markers mapped on the genetic map of A. evenia (2 n  = 20) to locate orthologous sequences on the chromosomes of A. duranensis and A. ipaensis (2 n  = 20) ( Supplementary Table S6 ). Although all the transcripts used to develop the markers did not necessarily contain predicted coding reading frames, ~97% of them (353 out of 364) showed significant matches to Arachis sequences. To facilitate comparison, the Aeschynomene linkage groups have been numbered and oriented to best match the corresponding Arachis chromosomes ( Supplementary Fig. S2 A,B).  When the A. evenia linkage groups and the A . ipaensis chromosomes were aligned, extensive stretches of shared colinearity between them were evident ( Fig. 7A , Supplementary Fig. S2 A). Some linkage groups of A. evenia showed hits mainly with one chromosome of A. ipaensis , notably AeLG1 that matches Araip.A01, AeLG2 with Araip.A02, AeLG5 with Araip.05, AeLG6 with Araip.06 and AeLG9 with Araip.09 ( Fig. 7A ). However, detailed analysis of macrosynteny between homologous chromosomes evidence internal rearrangements such as translocations and inversions ( Fig. 7B ). In addition, even though A. evenia and A. ipaensis share the same base chromosome number of 10, one-to-one relationships do not hold true for the remaining A. evenia linkage groups. Instead, they appear to be composed of segmental syntenic blocks matching different chromosomal positions in A. ipaensis as exemplified by AeLG4 that contains three conserved blocks found in the chromosomes Araip.A03, A04 and A10. It is worth noting that some gaps observed within Aeschynomene linkage groups are coincident with syntenic block junctions and thus may correspond to more variable regions prone to genome restructuring as suggested earlier. 4 In addition, Aeschynomene loci mostly match and cover the euchromatic arms of Arachis chromosomes while only few loci map pericentromeric regions ( Fig. 7A ). 18,22 This observation is consistent with all the euchromatic regions of the A. evenia genome being captured by the gene-based markers composing the genetic map.

Dot lines connect orthologous loci between the two species. The dot line link the non-macrosyntenic location of the AeCcaMK gene.  Considering the divergence time between Aeschynomene and Arachis (~49 Mya) relative to the isolation time of the Dalbergioid clade from the Phaseolids and Galegoids (~55 Mya), along with the 3 to 3.5-fold larger genome of A. duranensis and A. ipaensis (1,250 and 1,560 Mb, respectively) compared to A. evenia (415 Mb), the high level of macrosynteny documented here between Arachis and Aeschynomene is remarkable. Much of the expansion in Arachis genomes may be due to retroelements, but it has done little to disrupt macrosynteny that is dominated by large chromosome arms-size rearrangements. Such macrosynteny was found to be maintained for the symbiotic genes mapped onto the A. evenia linkage groups, suggesting that true orthologous relationships were identified ( Fig. 7A ). One noticeable exception concerns the CCaMK gene that is mapped onto AeLG8 and is positioned between two syntenic blocks, while its A. ipaensis ortholog locates on Araip.A01 chromosome within a block that is syntenic to AeLG1 ( Fig. 7A,B ). Although it is not possible to determine the extent to which macrosyntenic relationships identified by genetic mapping are indicative of conserved microsynteny, it is interesting to note that a retrotransposon insertion site was previously identified 564-bp upstream of the AeCCamK gene. 34 Since retrotransposons are known to be involved in genome restructuring and also to induce gene mobility, further studies may help determining their potential impact on the genomic environment of this key symbiotic gene in A. evenia . 4. Conclusions and perspectives To advance in our understanding of the NF-independent symbiosis in the model legume A. evenia , we developed a genetic map incorporating expressed genes that are likely to be involved in nodulation. Previous characterization of different genotypes in A. evenia allowed us to select the Mbao genotype as a reference for molecular genetics and the Bahia genotype as a suitable crossing parent to develop a F 2 mapping population. Transcriptome in silico analysis for the two parental genotypes enabled an efficient selection of polymorphic molecular markers that were used to genotype the mapping population. The choice of genotyping methods, i.e. multiplexing and capillary sequencing for SSR and INDEL markers along with the KASP assays for SNP markers resulted in 99.4% complete genotyping data. The genetic map was resolved in 10 robust linkage groups that most likely represented the 10 chromosome pairs in A. evenia . The availability of a high-density map containing easy-to-use and cost-effective markers will facilitate gene and QTL mapping work in A. evenia .  Given the gene-based nature of the markers used, this genetic map provided the first insights into the structure of the genome gene-space and, in particular, uncovered the distribution of expressed orthologs of known symbiotic genes. Comparative genomic analysis with Arachis further evidenced that the Aeschynomene genome constituted of macrosyntenic blocks. Therefore, this genetic map of Aeschynomene could form the basis for future efforts in the scaffold anchoring and assembly in an Aeschynomene genome sequencing initiative. The availability of a whole genome sequence is now feasible thanks to the next-generation sequencing technologies. This will allow much better comparison with Arachis to characterize genome evolution within the Dalbergioid clade. In particular, microsynteny analysis will allow investigating if chromosome rearrangements and transposable elements had an impact on certain symbiotic genes as suspected for the AeCCaMK gene and those that could not be found in the transcriptome datasets. Understanding how these symbiotic genes evolved (by changes of gene expression or by gene loss) in a NF-independent context would be an important advance in understanding the evolution of nodulation.  In addition, an a priori identification of symbiotic genes in A. evenia using a mutagenesis approach should be a powerful tool. In this perspective, a strategy combining gene mapping with sequencing at gene or whole genome-level will allow an efficient identification of new alleles and new symbiotic loci among mutant lines, as has been successfully performed in M. truncatula and L. japonicus . 31,43–46 New methods, such as SHOREmap and MutMap, now integrate simultaneous mapping and mutation identification in a single step by deep whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA from a F 2 mutant population. 47,48 This population can be obtained either by crossing the mutant to the mapping parent or to the original WT parental line used for mutagenesis. In the latter case, mapping relies on the detection of mutagenesis-induced polymorphisms. The similar genetic backgrounds present the advantage of both simplifying segregation patterns and suppressing the occurrence of distortions. As a result, applying this strategy to A. evenia , the identification of new symbiotic genes should be straightforward and should facilitate the deciphering of the molecular mechanisms of the NF-independent process.

Introduction RNA splicing is the process in which pre-mRNA transcripts mature and where introns, intervening fragments within transcripts, are recognized and removed, leaving retained regions termed exons that compose the mature mRNA. In eukaryotes spliceosomal introns are confined to the nucleus, and the splicing process is executed by the spliceosome, one of the largest molecular complexes in the cell. 1,2 Accurate processing of introns is a crucial regulatory step in determining the cell expression profile, and is required before protein translation can be initiated. As such, splicing efficiency (SE; efficient recognition and proper splicing by the spliceosome) and specificity are used to regulate growth, development, and overall response to external signals. 3,4 Extensive studies over the past two decades have revealed the core chemical reactions, several sequence determinants, and the major protein component interactions during intron splicing. 5–8 Nevertheless, the debate on intron origin and evolution has been ongoing intensively for decades. 9,10 The dynamic nature of spliceosome assembly and the complex interactions of both its proteins and RNA components with the pre-mRNA, give rise to a range of intronic SEs among different genes and within the same gene that may lead to altered SE, and facilitates the creation of different mature mRNA products from identical pre-mRNA transcripts; 11 in this process particular exons of a gene may be included within or excluded from (i.e. ‘skipped’) the final processed mRNA transcript. This phenomenon is termed alternative splicing (AS) and is the chief constituent of the increased number of proteins encoded by genomes of multicellular organisms. 12 Intron retention, in which an intron remains in the mature mRNA transcript, is widespread among plants and protozoa, but is infrequent in vertebrates and seldom found in fungi. 13–17 As such, it is often considered the earliest version of AS to have evolved and might reflect mis-splicing, as the splicing machinery may fail to recognize weak splice sites flanking short introns. Additional AS events include alternative splice sites selection, whilst the combination of two or more events can generate more complex mature mRNA products. 18–23 It was suggested that small introns in diverse organisms (such as Paramecium tetraurelia , Homo sapiens , Caenorhabditis elegans , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) are under selective pressure to cause premature translation termination in case an intron has not been spliced (i.e. ‘retained’). In particular, it has been proposed that the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway may have a proofreading role in gene expression, eliminating transcripts that have not been properly spliced; 24 moreover, the core components of the NMD machinery are evolutionarily conserved in all eukaryotic organisms tested so far, and their deletion or silencing prevents NMD in eukaryotic cells. 25–29 The amount of intron-containing genes, intron density per gene or per kilobase pair, and intron length, varies from one eukaryote to another. 30–33 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are <300 intron-containing genes (5% of ~6,000), of which few are mediated by two introns or more. 34,35 In fact, until now only two AS or intron retention events have been identified in this organism. 15,36 Nevertheless, in S. cerevisiae intron-containing genes are particularly highly expressed and account for more than 70% of its proteome. Additionally, several intron sequences are found duplicated within ribosomal protein paralogs. 37,38 Conversely, in S. pombe (an organisms with ~5,000 genes) there are ~5,000 introns spreading over a third of its genome, with up to 20 introns mediating a single gene 39 and with few known genes displaying AS. 17,40,41 Other fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans and Candida albicans show variations in intronic characteristics as well. 42,43 Nonetheless, even though eukaryotic evolution has been generally characterized by widespread intron gain and loss events, 10,44,45 the ubiquity of introns and the core of the spliceosome is conserved in all well-characterized eukaryotes. 1,46 Moreover, Hemiselmis andersenii is currently the only known eukaryotic organism without any introns or spliceosome subunit genes. 47 The intron boundary signals at the donor splice site (or 5'SS) and acceptor splice site (or 3'SS), the branch site (BS), and the polypyrimidine tract, are canonical sequence elements which are essential for intron recognition and for splicing to occur. The factors that bind to these sequence motifs and the biochemical reactions they perform are relatively well known due to the extensive research in this field. Systematic investigations show that this process is highly regulated: from spliceosome assembly, through pre-mRNA recognition and binding, to the splicing reaction and complex disassembly. 23,48 Additionally, it has been suggested that in yeast, introns regulate ribosome biogenesis and function, and affect cell fitness under stress. 49Despite such comprehensive studies, very little is known regarding the intronic features that are related to translation. Specifically, introns are believed to be the non-translated parts of the transcript; however, since splicing is not a perfect mechanism, it is possible that high enough splicing errors, such as intronic retention, will trigger selective pressure for translation efficiency (TE) adaptation at the 5' end of introns. Here, we conduct a novel large scale study of four fungal intronomes, to characterize novel genomic level intronic features in the vicinity of the intronic splice-sites, related to post-splicing/translation regulation, and understand their evolution.Materials and MethodsThe analysed organisms The four fungi analysed here ( S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, A. nidulans , and C. albicans ) were chosen based on the following considerations: S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are well studied organisms with well-established databases that are known to have diverged 350–900 million years ago. 50,A. nidulans and C. albicans are two additional fungi known to have diverged from S. pombe about 650 million years ago 51 and from S. cerevisiae about 235 million years ago. 52 The genomes of these organisms are also fully sequenced and their introns are well annotated. In addition, C. albicans is a dimorphic fungus which can be a significant pathogen in humans. Intronic sequence informationS. cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs) and intron-containing gene sequences (strain 288c) were taken from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD); 53 BS location information was obtained from the Ares lab database. 35,S. pombe genome information (Assembly 16) was taken from the PomBase database; 54 BS locations were calculated based on the position-specific scoring matrix information extracted from the Sanger Institute, and is based on the original full genome sequencing. 39,A. nidulans (FGSC A4) and C. albicans (SC5314 Assembly 21) genome information was taken from the Aspergillus Genome Database (AspGD) 55 and Candida Genome Database (CGD), 56 respectively; BS locations were calculated based on the fungal BS consensus sequence ( CURAY ). We used only introns taken from coding sequences (CDSs) and excluded 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR introns. Introns associated with putative or alternatively spliced genes were also excluded; the full intron exclusion list can be found in  Supplementary Table S4 . Additional GC content and general information can be found in  Supplementary Table S5 ; exon–intron GC content was calculated using intron sequences and their flanking exon sequences (100 bp upstream and downstream). Protein abundance, mRNA levels, and metabolic cost Protein abundance (PA) information for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe was taken from the PaxDb dataset, 57 which integrates information from various resources. The mRNA levels for S. cerevisiae are based on RNA-seq and DNA chip and were obtained by integrating three datasets 58–60 in the following manner: first, we normalized each dataset by its average mRNA levels; next, for each gene we averaged all its normalized measurements (dataset with no value was ignored). Protein per mRNA ratio (PPR), i.e. the number of proteins produced on average from an mRNA molecule, was calculated by dividing PA by mRNA levels. PA levels are measured in parts per millions. The mRNA is based on RNA-seq and DNA chip and thus is proportional to the mRNA levels (number of molecules in the cell). Since our analysis is based on spearman correlation, ranking of genes according to their expression levels is enough to provide the required results ( i.e. the actual levels will not change the results). Data for metabolic cost of amino acids (AAs) for S. cerevisiae were taken from Ref. 61 and were also used as an approximation for S. pombe , as no S. pombe data were available. Randomization models The randomized models were designed to conserve encoded protein information, in addition to the intronic properties. Specifically, we maintained codon frequencies [i.e. codon-usage bias (CUB)], canonical splicing signals, and GC content. To this end, the distribution of codons in the CDS was calculated for each gene, and the sequence was then randomized while maintaining these codon frequencies (i.e. for each AA in the gene, the probability of a certain codon was determined by its individual distribution in the CDS) and the amino acid content and order (i.e. the encoded protein); this was separately done for upstream and downstream exons. For each gene, intronic nucleotides were uniformly permutated, maintaining consensus sequences (5'SS, BS, and 3'SS) and the intronic GC content. We used the following randomization schemes to generate random sets: (i) Codon only and (ii) Intron only. Next, a combination of the basic schemes was applied, i.e. (i) + (ii), and is used throughout the study; the randomization models are also illustrated in Fig. 1C and D . In the models used in Figs 3 and 5 , we randomized the intronic sequences while assuming introns as being translated. Specifically, we ‘continued’ the introns in the same frame of their upstream exons and considered the triplets of nucleotides in the introns as ‘artificial’ codons; next, we scrambled them while controlling for their CUB and GC content.  Pre-mRNA exonic and intronic regions, basic definitions, and randomization models. (A) The analysed fungal genes can be divided into three major regions: UTRs, exons, and introns (in the analysed organisms we did not consider UTR introns since they are not flanked by translated regions). The introns include three canonical consensus sequences: the donor (or 5'SS; subsequence GTATGT ) and acceptor (or 3'SS; subsequence YAG ) that define intronic boundaries, and the branch site (BS; subsequence CTRAY ) that is required for the lariat formation. (B) In our analyses, exons and introns were divided into three domains: Exonic Donor (up to 90 nt upstream from the 5'SS), pre-STOP (up to 90 nt upstream from the first intronic STOP codon), and post-STOP (up to 90 nt downstream from the first intronic STOP codon); the features surrounding the boundaries of these regions are studied here. (C and D) In order to demonstrate that the reported features are under selective pressure, we compared the potentially translated sequences to the ones obtained by the following randomized models: (C) encoded protein information is maintained; synonymous codons frequencies of each gene (separately) are maintained; (D) uniform permutation of intronic nucleotides (per intron); the randomization models preserve these consensus sequences (5'SS/BS/3'SS), as well as additional exonic and intronic characteristics (see Materials and methods and Supplementary information ). The results suggest adaptation to the translation process at the beginning of introns via preference for STOP codons close to the intronic 5' end, and for CUB resembling the one appearing in annotated ORFs. This discovery is also supported by ribosomal profiling (RP) footprint measurements which are significantly higher in the 5' end intronic region than in the intronic region downstream of the STOP codon.

This discovery is also supported by ribosomal profiling (RP) footprint measurements which are significantly higher in the 5' end intronic region than in the intronic region downstream of the STOP codon. Evaluation of significance levels For each genome, up to 1,000 random intronomes were generated (1,000 for S. cerevisiae and C. albicans , 200 for S. pombe and A. nidulans ). The level of significance (i.e. empirical P -value) was determined based on a comparison between the random intronomes and the actual one as follows, when we expect the real to be significantly lower than the randomized version (e.g. in the case of the distance to STOP codon): Let S0 be the value of the actual intronome and S=S1, S2,<U+22EF>,SN a vector containing N random values sampled from the randomized models, where Si  is the value of the ith sample; then p=1N<U+2211>i=1N|Si>S0| , N  = 1,000. When we expect the real to be significantly higher than the randomized version (e.g. the typical decoding rate (TDR)/tAI) the P -valued was computed as follows: p=1N<U+2211>i=1N|Si<S0| , N  = 1,000.  The mean distance to the first STOP codon (shown e.g. in Fig. 2 ) was calculated over all introns and then compared to the distribution of means in the randomized sequences, which maintain the length and nucleotide distribution per intron. Note that performing the P -value computation separately for each intron cannot ‘mathematically’ work in this case: since three of the codons are STOP codons, the probability to get an in-frame intronic STOP codon in a certain position in the case of uniform nucleotide distribution is ~0.05 (1–61/64). Similarly, the probability to get a STOP codon in the first or second positions is ~0.09 (1–(61/64)*(61/64)). Thus, a significant intron (with P ~ 0.05 or very close to this value) can only be observed if the STOP codon is exactly in the first ‘codon’ of the intron. Nevertheless, for a large set of introns (e.g . an entire intronome) we have enough ‘degrees of freedom’ to detect such signals.  First intronic STOP codon analysis. The position of the first STOP codon relatively to the beginning of the intron in the actual retained intronome tends to be closer to the 5'SS than in randomized intronome models. (A) Illustration of the translation process showing ribosomes on a transcript with a retained intron; the generated protein contains amino acids (AAs) that are encoded in the intronic nucleotide composition; as demonstrated in this case translation is usually terminated by a PTC, resulting in a truncated peptide. (B and C) Analysis of the average potential truncated peptide length distribution over the entire transcriptome (transcripts with introns) in the randomized models compared to the actual ones: (B) Average truncated peptide length distribution in S. cerevisiae suggests that there is preference for shorter retained protein length; the average length of the randomized model is 37% longer than the actual intronome (20.37AA vs. 14.89AA, respectively; empirical P  = 0.024; see Materials and methods; actual length displayed in broken line). (C) Average truncated peptide length distribution in S. pombe suggests that there is preference for shorter retained protein length; the average length of the randomized model is 8% longer than the actual intronome (21.49AA vs. 19.91AA, respectively; empirical P  = 0.025; actual length displayed by broken line); for comparison, the average truncated peptide length in the case of uniform nucleotide distribution is 21.33AA. (D and E) Average potential truncated peptide length over subsets of the actual transcriptome in comparison to the randomized models: (D) Intronome analysis of highly vs. lowly expressed genes in S. cerevisiae exhibits 76% longer truncated protein length in lowly expressed genes (9.13AA vs. 16.08AA; left and right, respectively); distribution analysis demonstrates evidence of selection in highly expressed genes but no significant selection in lowly expressed genes (empirical P  <  1·10 -3 and empirical P  = 0.242; left and right, respectively; actual length displayed by broken line). (E) Intronome analysis of highly vs. lowly expressed genes in S. pombe exhibits 143% longer truncated protein length in lowly expressed genes (11.34AA vs. 27.52AA; left and right, respectively); distribution analysis demonstrates evidence of selection in highly expressed genes but no significant selection in lowly expressed genes (empirical P  <  5·10 -3 and empirical P  = 0.665, respectively; actual length displayed by broken line).  First intronic STOP codon analysis. The position of the first STOP codon relatively to the beginning of the intron in the actual retained intronome tends to be closer to the 5'SS than in randomized intronome models.

The mean of TDR scores were calculated using the modified Sharp and Li formulation: 62,63,TDR=exp1/L<U+2211>l=1Lln1/µil , where L is the AA sequence length, and µi is the typical codon decoding time of the ith codon; µ values for S. cerevisiae were taken from Ref. 64 and are based on experimental measurements. 60 The tRNA adaptation index (tAI) scores were calculated using the scheme described in Ref. 65 ; genomic tRNA copy numbers for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe were obtained from the genomic tRNA Database; 66 for A. nidulans , and C. albicans , we used the tRNA copy numbers reported in Ref. 67 while organism-specific Sij values were taken from Ref. 68 .  CUB profiles for the S. cerevisiae intronome. The profiles show that the average of TDRs index values upstream from the first intronic STOP codon is higher than the average of the TDR values downstream of it, supporting the conjecture that the beginnings of introns undergo evolutionary selection for higher TE. (A) Actual and random average TDR values (blue and green, respectively; see Materials and methods) aligned to the beginning of the 5'SS (Exonic Donor) and the first intronic STOP codon (pre-STOP, post-STOP) locations. (B) Mean TDR profile aligned to the beginning of the 5'SS (top) and the first Intronic STOP codon (bottom). As expected, TDR values downstream from the 5' end of the exon/intron boundary (right side of the 5'SS) are lower than upstream of it (top; P  = 2.04·10 -8 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the exonic and pre-STOP values, per gene). Mean TDR profile of the first Intronic STOP codon demonstrates that the TDR upstream from the first intronic STOP location is higher than the TDR downstream of it (bottom; P  = 4.91·10 -18 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the pre-STOP and post-STOP values, per gene). (C) Mean values over all regions of the actual intronome and randomized version (blue and green, respectively). The STD of the randomized genomes for these regions (light magenta) shows a significant signal in the pre-STOP domain; mean values are 5.239/5.167/4.929 for the actual intronome and 5.236/5.163/4.948 for the randomized intronome (left, middle, and right; respectively). (D) High standard normalization global Z-scores (red, over all intronic ‘codons’; see Materials and methods) in the pre-STOP domain and very low global Z-scores in the post-STOP domain support the conjecture that the intronic pre-STOP codon selective pressure hypothesis is true; genes with STOP codons positioned in the downstream exon and locations with <15% of the intronome were ignored.  CUB profiles for the S. cerevisiae intronome. The profiles show that the average of TDRs index values upstream from the first intronic STOP codon is higher than the average of the TDR values downstream of it, supporting the conjecture that the beginnings of introns undergo evolutionary selection for higher TE. (A) Actual and random average TDR values (blue and green, respectively; see Materials and methods) aligned to the beginning of the 5'SS (Exonic Donor) and the first intronic STOP codon (pre-STOP, post-STOP) locations. (B) Mean TDR profile aligned to the beginning of the 5'SS (top) and the first Intronic STOP codon (bottom). As expected, TDR values downstream from the 5' end of the exon/intron boundary (right side of the 5'SS) are lower than upstream of it (top; P  = 2.04·10 -8 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the exonic and pre-STOP values, per gene). Mean TDR profile of the first Intronic STOP codon demonstrates that the TDR upstream from the first intronic STOP location is higher than the TDR downstream of it (bottom; P  = 4.91·10 -18 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the pre-STOP and post-STOP values, per gene). (C) Mean values over all regions of the actual intronome and randomized version (blue and green, respectively). The STD of the randomized genomes for these regions (light magenta) shows a significant signal in the pre-STOP domain; mean values are 5.239/5.167/4.929 for the actual intronome and 5.236/5.163/4.948 for the randomized intronome (left, middle, and right; respectively). (D) High standard normalization global Z-scores (red, over all intronic ‘codons’; see Materials and methods) in the pre-STOP domain and very low global Z-scores in the post-STOP domain support the conjecture that the intronic pre-STOP codon selective pressure hypothesis is true; genes with STOP codons positioned in the downstream exon and locations with <15% of the intronome were ignored.  where  tAIi¯=<U+2211>jtAIjiGenej, and Genej is the number of genes with translatable codons at their ith location. Additionally, downstream exons in 5'SS profiles and all exons in STOP profiles were excluded, as well as UTRs such as 5'UTR and 3'UTR; analysis of STOP profiles when downstream exons are included (as illustrated in  Supplementary Fig. S8 ) showed similar results. Values for the entire domains (shown e.g. in Fig. 3A ) were calculated as the geometric mean per intron and then averaged over all introns. Wilcoxon signed-rank (paired) tests and paired t -tests were performed between the upstream/downstream average values per gene on the TDR/tAI profiles; additional statistics, including Spearman correlations of TDR/tAI with PA levels, can be found in  Supplementary Table S1 .  The randomized models used maintained the CDS codon frequencies (i.e. CUB) and uniformly permutated the intronic nucleotides, maintaining consensus sequences (as previously described; see also Fig. 1C and D ). During randomization, the 5'SS alignment termination position (  Supplementary Fig. S8A–C ) was set according to the randomization results, i.e. randomized termination point location. In the case of termination point alignment (  Supplementary Fig. S8F ), the termination point alignment position was set to the original place of the retained intron in order to avoid location bias. The intronome fraction level which determines the edges of analysis was set to 15% of the overall intronome (the results are robust to reasonable changes in this cut-off). Computing Z scores based on the randomized models Standard normal distribution scoring (i.e. Z-score) is a statistical measure that can be used for quantitative selection level evaluation via the comparison of the real signal to a randomized one; higher Z-score means higher chance that the selective pressure hypothesis is true and vice versa. Absolute values higher than 1.96 are typically considered to be significant, based on 95% confidence level (i.e. P  < 0.05). Z-score values were calculated according to the following equation:  Zscore=µreal-µrandsrand where µreal is the mean related to the actual intronome, µrand is the random model mean, and srand is the random model standard deviation (STD). We used the following scheme related to the TDR/tAI profiles values: for each randomized model, a vector of average values was generated (i.e. an average for each random intronome) and the global Z-score was calculated. Ribosomal profiling analysis The ribosomal profiling (RP) method gives quantitative information of ribosome footprints and ribosomal density (RD) in a single nucleotide resolution. 60 The analysis was performed as follows: RP raw data were obtained from NCBI GEO database 69 (accession GSE13750) for two footprinting experiment replicates in rich media and mapped in a similar manner to the one described in Refs 60 and 70 . It includes the following major steps: (i) Degenerate reads, i.e. reads in which 18 or more of the first 22 nt are A bases (meaning the entire read is composed of the homopolymer A tail), were eliminated. Reads mapped to ribosomal RNA genes and other non-coding genes, such as tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, taken from Biomart (version R64-1-1), 71 were excluded. (ii) The entire pre-mRNA set of the S. cerevisiae genome was reconstructed utilizing BioMart (version R64-1-1); 71,59 and each pre-mRNA included its 5'UTR, exons, introns, and 3'UTR, genes with no 5'UTR and 3'UTR annotations were supplemented with flanking genomic segments with the maximum length ensuring there is no overlap with existing coding regions. (iii) Reads of 36 nt were mapped using bowtie 72 to the pre-mRNA sequences allowing up to two mismatches on a seed length of 21 nt, to account for polyadenylation of footprint fragments. (iv) Non-uniquely mapped reads were extended from the mapped seed length of 21–28 nt to determine uniqueness, by first removing the poly-A tail of each 36 nt long read according to the following heuristic: we determine the poly-A tail from the read’s end, by identifying the longest stretch of As allowing two mismatches and removing it, reads longer than 28 nt were cropped, and reads shorter than the 21 nt seed length after poly-A tail removal were discarded, now the read with the lowest mismatch score was selected if it uniquely exists; otherwise, the remaining contender multi-reads were distributed proportionally to the density of the uniquely mapped reads in their vicinity (30 nt upstream and downstream).  Based on the RP footprint read counts (RCs) of the two aforementioned experiment replicates, and the 5'UTR, exon, intron, 3'UTR annotations of 282 S. cerevisiae intron-containing genes, we performed the following analysis: (i) the position of the ribosome A-site was related to 15 nt from the beginning of the read; (ii) we averaged the profiles obtained for the two replicates; (iii) averaged profiles were generated in a similar way to the tAI profiles previously described, however in a nucleotide-based resolution with the following adjustments: downstream exons from the 5'SS alignment were excluded, as well as upstream exons from the STOP alignment; in addition, genes with a STOP codon positioned in the downstream exon were excluded; in the second intronic STOP analysis, RCs upstream from the first intronic STOP codon were excluded as well. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t -test were performed between the upstream/downstream average values per gene on the RP (  Supplementary Table S1 ). Analysis scheme with a possible gene example is presented in  Supplementary Fig. S10 . The estimation of the difference between the pre-STOP and post-STOP domain (shown in Fig. 7G ) was done using 3,804 genes with observed protein levels taken from Ref. 73 , while excluding putative genes, dubious ORFs, and genes with No RC values at all. List of RP genes with nonzero RC in their pre-STOP domain can be found in  Supplementary Table S6 . Additional A-site related offset alignments of 14 and 16 nt show similar results (  Supplementary Fig. S12 ). Subgroups analysis and bias control Introns were divided into subgroup sets according to various criteria: ribosomal vs. non-ribosomal, and highly expressed vs. lowly expressed (based on PA, RD, mRNA, or PPR measurements). Subgroups of different size may cause bias in the strength/significance of the detected statistical signals; therefore (and in order to control for the effect of different group sizes on the Z-score), we ensured that the size of both subgroup pairs is identical (i.e. equal number of introns in each subgroup); in case of a difference, introns were chosen randomly form the larger group to match subgroup size (e.g. in S. cerevisiae 93 introns were randomly chosen from a set of 187 non-ribosomal introns in total to match the ribosomal ones). Two sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and two sample t -test were performed on the TDR/tAI profiles. Synthetic YiFP reporter library building and analysis The synthetic YiFP reporter library was downloaded from Yofe et al.74 Briefly, to create the synthetic intron reporter library, S. cerevisiae was transformed with a library of DNA transformation cassettes; each containing a different native yeast intron. The cassettes were assembled using the Y-operation 75,76 by which introns were embedded in a Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) fragment and concatenated to a common selection marker in high throughput. In this manner 240 strains were created, termed YiFP strains, where the sole difference between all strains is the native S. cerevisiae intron intervening the YFP gene. The contribution of introns to the regulation of gene expression was assessed by dynamic measurements of YFP expression. Following normalization, the expression level of each intron strain was compared to that of the intron-less YFP strain to give a measure of its relative expression level, which is related to intronic SE. YiFP strains that had a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 5 and above were classified as spliced (178 introns), while the others (SNR < 5; 62 introns) were classified as un-spliced. Gene ontology function specific group analysis We used the gene ontology (GO) annotation database ( http://www.geneontology.org /, 13 May 2016, date last accessed) to derive all the functional gene groups related to the three ontology domains (Cellular component, Molecular function, and Biological process). We analysed a subset of the terms, i.e. GO Slim, evaluating 90 terms in the database with at least 50 introns (out of a total of 145 terms; each term contains at least 1% of the S. pombe intronome), and built corresponding Z-score profiles for each subgroup. Profiles were then vertically aligned in three ontology clusters, to present exonic donor, pre-STOP and post STOP intervals. Significance level for each term was calculated using a two sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the tAI upstream and downstream intervals, aligned to the STOP codon. Considering cases when the first in-frame STOP codon is downstream of the introns Here, we provide some additional specific details regarding the manner in which we consider the cases when the first in-frame STOP is downstream of the introns: the cases where the first in-frame STOP codon is in the 3' UTR are very rare (<0.5%) and are ignored or do not exist; these cases are very probably related to sequencing/annotation errors (i.e. the main ORF does not include a STOP codon), and do not exist at all in well annotated organisms (e.g. S. cerevisiae ). We ignore the very few cases (around ~2%) where the first in-frame STOP is a main ORF STOP codon since, by the definition of our random model, in these cases the random and real sequences are identical. It is easy to see that any reasonable consideration of these cases does not affect any conclusion of the study. Also note that when we plot TE (e.g. adaptation to the tRNA pool/TDR) and Ribo-seq profiles we ignore non-intronic parts since we do not want to bias the results (the TDR/tAI/Ribo-seq in exons is expected to be very high in comparison to introns), and to perform the most conservative and relevant test possible.Results In this study, we analyse the intronome of four fungi: S. cerevisiae , S. pombe , A. nidulans , and C. albicans ; S. cerevisiae ; and S. pombe are both well studied and diverged ~350–900 million years ago; 50A. nidulans and C. albicans are two additional fungi with fully sequenced genomes and well annotated introns (see further details regarding these organisms in Materials and methods). Specifically, the analysed data include 277 introns from S. cerevisiae , 4,747 introns from S. pombe , 2,427 introns from A. nidulans , and 391 introns from C. albicans .  Our objective was to evaluate systematically novel sequence features/patterns near the splice sites that promote splicing regulation and affect TE at the genomic level, towards a better understanding of intronic evolution. To this end, we defined three pre-mRNA exonic and intronic regions that will be used hereafter and are illustrated in Fig. 1A and B : Exonic Donor—exonic region 90 nt upstream from the 5'SS (excluding upstream 5' UTR); pre-STOP—intronic region 90 nt upstream from the first STOP codon (excluding the STOP itself and upstream exons), aligned to the 5'SS or to the first STOP codon; post-STOP—intronic region 90 nt downstream from the first STOP codon (excluding the STOP itself, downstream exons, and 3' UTR), aligned to the first STOP codon; the pre-mRNA exon–intron boundaries, consensus sequences, and STOP codon are illustrated as well. We focused on three related aspects: (i) The position of STOP codons in possibly retained parts of the introns. (ii) The possible adaptation of the intronic ‘codons’ to the translation-elongation step in potentially retained parts of the introns (i.e . the intronic beginning; in-frame of the preceding exon and before the first STOP codon). (iii) The density of ribosomes on possibly retained parts of the introns. In all cases, we performed a comparative adaption analysis of various intronic subsets and functions. Evidence of selective pressure for intronic STOP codons near the 5'SS presumably to decrease translation and metabolic costs of retained introns Splicing, like other biological processes, does not exhibit perfect fidelity. Thus, it is clear that there are cases where introns are not spliced, and translation-elongation continues through the retained beginning of the intronic sequence. 14 If such events are frequent enough, we presume that evolution will shape the beginning of retained introns for reduced translation and metabolic costs, and possibly for increased TE (see illustration of truncated peptide formation in Fig. 2A ). In this subsection, we study one aspect related to this argument.  Assuming that retained introns’ translation is usually deleterious to the cell, we expect to see preference for close STOP codons or premature termination codons (PTCs) at the beginning of introns in-frame of the exons preceding them. To test this hypothesis, we compared the mean distance to the first STOP codon in possibly retained introns in actual genomes, to the ones obtained in randomized genomes that controlled for their exonic CUB and GC content, maintained intronic consensus sequences, and controlled for intronic GC content (per gene; see details in Materials and methods and in Fig. 1C and D ). Specifically, we calculated the average length of all truncated peptides originating from non-spliced transcripts (relative to the end of each preceding exon) and compared it with the average lengths obtained using the randomized models. As can be seen in Fig. 2B and C , the average truncated peptide length in the randomized models was 37% and 8% longer than the actual one for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively; evaluation of the average length distribution in the randomized models shows that it is indeed significantly longer than observed in the actual intronome (empirical P -value: P  = 2.3·10 -2 , P  = 2.4·10 -2 ; P  = 8.55·10 -8 and P  = 1.25·10 -15 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the actual and average randomized models values per gene, which is a paired test; S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively; see details in Materials and methods and in  Supplementary Fig. S14A and B ).  We expect selection for intronic STOP codons near the 5' end of the intron to be higher in highly expressed genes, which potentially consume more intercellular translation resources. Thus, we further examined two intronic subgroups of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , originating from highly and lowly expressed genes; 60 and 500 introns were included in each subgroup for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively, constituting 21% and 11% of their respective intronome, based on their PA (see Materials and methods). Analysis confirmed that the average retained peptide length in lowly expressed genes was 76% and 143% longer than in highly expressed genes for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively ( P  = 3.61·10 -4 and P  = 1.54·10 -2 , Wilcoxon rank-sum test between the highly and lowly expressed genes; Fig. 2D and E and  Supplementary Fig. S14C and D ). Evaluation of the average length distribution obtained using the randomized models showed that randomized highly expressed genes have significantly longer peptide length than observed in the actual intronome (empirical P  < 1·10 -3 and empirical P  <  5·10 -3 for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively). Contrary, lowly expressed genes did not exhibit evidence of significant selection (empirical P  >  0.24 and empirical P   > 0.66, for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively; Fig. 2D and E ), as expected. Similar results and conclusions were obtained using randomized models that separately maintained GC content in the first and second intronic fragments ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).  Furthermore, we considered the metabolic biosynthesis costs of the truncated peptides originating from the non-spliced transcripts (relative to the end of each preceding exon and up to the STOP codon; see Materials and methods). The results shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A and B demonstrate that the metabolic costs of the truncated peptides are 25% and 7% lower than in the randomized models for S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively; analysis of the randomized models average cost shows that it is indeed significantly higher than observed in the actual intronome (empirical P -value: P  = 2.6·10 -2 , P  = 3.5·10 -2 , P  = 9.36·10 -7 , and P  = 8.5·10 -15 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the actual and average randomized models values per gene; S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively;  Supplementary Fig. S14E and F ). Further analysis confirmed that the signal is stronger for highly expressed genes (highly: empirical P  <  1·10 -3 and empirical P  <  5 · 10 -3 ; lowly: empirical P  > 0.26 and empirical P  > 0.68, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe , respectively;  Supplementary Fig. S2C and D ). Together, these results support the conjecture that introns are selected for a STOP codon close to the 5'SS in order to decrease the length and corresponding metabolic costs of undesired translated peptides in the case of intron retention, presumably to reduce the global cost of translating such peptides; not surprisingly, highly expressed genes show evidence of significantly higher levels of selection for these intronic features.Evidence of selective pressure for elevated intronic TE near the 5 ' SS and upstream from the first STOP codon presumably to decrease translation costs and improve TE of retained introns It was suggested that selection for certain synonymous codons improves TE (in terms of rate and fidelity), reduces the cost of the translation process (e.g. via improving ribosomal allocation), and affects organismal fitness. 77–81 Thus, a preference for codons that are translated in a more efficient manner may possibly reduce translational costs of retained introns, even if their product is not functional or entirely functional. Therefore, if a relatively large fraction of the intronome is occasionally retained, we can expect to see preference for codons with translation rates or TE relatively similar to typical ORFs in the intronic region upstream from the first intronic STOP codon. 82,83 Hence, and in order to provide evidence supporting this hypothesis, we analysed two measures that estimate the TE or speed of codons: the first is the tAI of a gene (or other genomic sequence), which estimates its adaptation to the tRNA pool. 84 In the case of S. cerevisiae , we used an additional measure: the TDR (see Materials and methods ), which is expected to be more accurate since it incorporates direct experimental RP data; 63,64 TDR is currently not available for the other studied organisms. To this end, the tAI/TDR profiles of all intron-containing genes were computed both in the exonic and the intronic regions (see details in Materials and methods  and  Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The profiles were aligned around: (i) the 5'SS of the introns and (ii) the first intronic STOP codon, and a mean profile was generated. A summary of the analysis for S. cerevisiae is presented in Fig. 3 . As anticipated, the average TDR values in the exonic regions upstream of the 5'SS were higher than in the intronic regions downstream from it ( Fig. 3A and B ;P  = 2.04·10 -8 ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the upstream and downstream values per gene). Furthermore, the average TDR values of the intronic sequences tend to be higher before the first intronic STOP codon relatively to the intronic sequence downstream from it ( P  = 4.91·10  -   18 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the upstream and downstream values per gene). Similarly, when the mean intronic TDR before the first intronic STOP codon was compared with the randomized models it was found to be significantly higher ( Fig. 3C ). Finally, comparison to randomized models shows that the average Z-score value in the pre-STOP domain is significant, while not significant in the post-STOP domain ( Fig. 3D ; 4.013 vs. -0.078, respectively), supporting the suggested hypothesis that the region before the first intronic STOP codon undergoes evolutionary selection for higher TE (see details on Z-score calculation in Materials and methods). Similar results were obtained in S. pombe , A. nidulans , and C. albicans (using tAI; see  Supplementary Figs S4–S6 , respectively). A summary of the average TDR/tAI and corresponding Z-scores shown in Fig. 4A and B demonstrates that in all studied organisms the pre-STOP domain exhibits higher translation adaptation levels in comparison to the post-STOP domain; full analysis and statistical information, including average random values and empirical P -value information, can be found in  Supplementary Table S1 . Similar results were obtained when using randomized models that separately maintained GC content in the first and second intronic fragments (  Supplementary Fig. S7 ); profiles aligned around the 3'SS can be seen in  Supplementary Fig. S13 .  CUB and translation efficiency summary. (A) Average TDR ( S. cerevisiae ) and tAI ( S. pombe , A. nidulans , and C . albicans ) in the Exonic Donor, pre-STOP and post-STOP domains of the examined organisms exhibit monotonic decrease in CUB over these three domains. (B) In all of the examined organisms the global Z-score at the pre-STOP domain is > 2 whereas the Z-score post-STOP domain is negative, supporting the hypothesis that there is selection for codons similar to some typical ORFs in the pre-STOP but not in the post-STOP domain, probably to optimize translation. (C) Distribution analysis of the S. cerevisiae whole genome demonstrate that the average TDR at the beginning of its introns is higher than in 23.87% of the genes (average value of 5.1); downstream from the first intronic STOP codon the values drop to be higher than only 0.07% of the genes (average value of 4.77); in comparison, average values of the top 300 highly expressed genes is 6.17. (D) Distribution analysis of the S. pombe whole genome demonstrate that the average tAI at the beginning of its introns is higher than in 31.02% of the genes (average value of 0.382); downstream from the first intronic STOP codon the values drop to be higher than only 0.1% of the genes (average value of 0.313); in comparison, the average value of the top 300 highly expressed genes is 0.542.  CUB and translation efficiency summary. (A) Average TDR ( S. cerevisiae ) and tAI ( S. pombe , A. nidulans , and C . albicans ) in the Exonic Donor, pre-STOP and post-STOP domains of the examined organisms exhibit monotonic decrease in CUB over these three domains. (B) In all of the examined organisms the global Z-score at the pre-STOP domain is > 2 whereas the Z-score post-STOP domain is negative, supporting the hypothesis that there is selection for codons similar to some typical ORFs in the pre-STOP but not in the post-STOP domain, probably to optimize translation. (C) Distribution analysis of the S. cerevisiae whole genome demonstrate that the average TDR at the beginning of its introns is higher than in 23.87% of the genes (average value of 5.1); downstream from the first intronic STOP codon the values drop to be higher than only 0.07% of the genes (average value of 4.77); in comparison, average values of the top 300 highly expressed genes is 6.17. (D) Distribution analysis of the S. pombe whole genome demonstrate that the average tAI at the beginning of its introns is higher than in 31.02% of the genes (average value of 0.382); downstream from the first intronic STOP codon the values drop to be higher than only 0.1% of the genes (average value of 0.313); in comparison, the average value of the top 300 highly expressed genes is 0.542.  We suggest that the beginning of introns tend to be translated frequently enough to trigger TDR/tAI preference resembling typical fungal ORFs. Specifically, when we compared the average TDR/tAI of the intronic upstream region to all of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe genes, we found that in these organisms 23.87% and 31.02% of the genes, respectively, have lower values, as can be seen in Fig. 4C and D . This result demonstrates that the TDR/tAI at the beginning of introns is similar to the TDR/tAI for typically expressed genes. Evidence of higher selective pressure on CUB to improve TE at the beginning of introns for introns located in highly translated genes in S. cerevisiae In budding yeast, almost all introns were lost during evolution. 85,86 However, the ones that were preserved are known to be generally found in highly expressed genes; moreover, about a third of its intronome originates from genes encoding ribosomal proteins. 37 It is also known that highly expressed genes tend to undergo selection to include codons that are translated more efficiently; 63,64,84,87,88 thus, we also expect higher selection pressure for ‘codons’ that are translated more efficiently at the 5' end of introns in highly translated genes. Therefore, in order to determine whether there is a significant difference in the selection for TE between highly and lowly expressed genes at the beginning of introns, intron-containing genes in S. cerevisiae were divided into two subgroups: 93 introns originating from the very highly expressed ribosomal genes and 93 introns originating from non-ribosomal genes (arbitrarily selected out of 187 in total to control for the effect of different group sizes; see Materials and methods ), and TDR profiles were generated for each group. We further analysed the randomized model that combines randomizations of codons and introns for the aforementioned subgroups to identify evidence of selection based on Z-score profiles calculations. Moreover, we examined the corresponding TDR Z-score profiles of four additional subgroups of the S. cerevisiae intronome based on their PA, mRNA levels, RD measurements, 60 and the PPR, which is an estimation of the translation rate (271, 273, 279, and 266 introns, respectively; see Materials and methods ). This was accomplished via sorting the intronome according to each measure, and analysing its upper tertiary and lower tertiary, i.e. 85 introns in each subgroup. A summary of the TDR Z-score profiles shown in Fig. 5A demonstrates that both ribosomal and non-ribosomal introns exhibit significant selective pressure in the pre-STOP domain (Z > 3.5; see Materials and methods), but no substantial selection in the post-STOP domain. Likewise, introns with high PPR/PA/mRNA/RD exhibit higher and significant selective pressure in comparison to introns with low PPR/PA/mRNA/RD, in the pre-STOP domain, and no substantial selection in the post-STOP domain (|Z|<1.34). This suggests a higher level of retained intron adaptation to the translation process in those subgroups (e.g. in the pre-STOP domain Z = 5.3 for high PPR vs. Z = -0.99 for low PPR; see Materials and methods; additional information can be found in  Supplementary Table S2 ). Furthermore, the selection signal is better related to PA rather than to mRNA levels (Z = 4.74 for high PA vs. Z = 3.79 for high mRNA): the expected intronic TE selection pressure is related to [ mRNA concentration • translational initiation rate per mRNA • splicing error rate ], whereas the protein level (PA) is related to [ mRNA concentration • translational initiation rate per mRNA ] and is expected to have higher correlation with selection levels. 60 Thus, the fact that the TE signal better correlate with PA rather than with mRNA supports the conjecture that indeed the selection for codons with high TDR at the 5' end of introns is related to translation and not to pre-translation gene expression stages.  CUB analysis in various subgroups of S. cerevisiae . (A) Average TDR Z-scores for various intronome subgroups examined in S. cerevisiae : ribosomal vs . non-ribosomal, high levels of PPR vs . low levels of PPR, high PA vs . low PA, high mRNA levels vs . low mRNA levels, and high RD vs . low RD. 60 Introns originating from highly translated genes (e.g. high PPR/PA; Z > 4.74) exhibit higher TDR Z-score values than introns originating from lowly translated genes (e.g. low PPR/PA; |Z|<0.99) in the pre-STOP domain (see Materials and methods); results in the post-STOP domain were not significant (|Z|<1.34); see full information in  Supplementary Table S2 . (B and C) Standardized reporter approach for studying SE in S. cerevisiae : (B) Overview of a previously reported approach for studying splicing mediated gene expression of a reported gene as an assessment of SE (see details in Materials and methods and Ref. 74 ). (C) Average TDR Z-scores for high/low levels of SE in the synthetic library: results were significant in the pre-STOP domain for highly spliced genes (Z = 3.49), but not significant in the post-STOP domain (|Z|<0.74; see full information in  Supplementary Table S2 ). These results support the hypothesis that there is higher selective pressure for TE in introns originating from highly expressed/translated and highly spliced genes ( vs. introns originating from lowly expressed/translated and lowly spliced genes); thus, they are consistent with the accepted hypothesis that highly expressed genes are generally more adapted to the tRNA pool, the translation process, and to various gene expression steps in general. 62,81,87,88 CUB analysis in various subgroups of S. cerevisiae .

These results support the hypothesis that there is higher selective pressure for TE in introns originating from highly expressed/translated and highly spliced genes ( vs. introns originating from lowly expressed/translated and lowly spliced genes); thus, they are consistent with the accepted hypothesis that highly expressed genes are generally more adapted to the tRNA pool, the translation process, and to various gene expression steps in general. 62,81,87,88The connection between elevated intronic TE near the 5 ' SS and upstream from the first STOP codon and SE measured via a synthetic intron library system The aim of the current section is to provide evidence supporting the conjecture that the reported signals at the intronic 5' are associated with SE. To this end, we analysed previously reported measurements of different introns transformed into a Yellow Fluorescence intron Library (YiFP) as a system for estimating SE in S. cerevisiae (Ref. 74 ; higher YiFP is related to higher SE; see Fig. 5B , Materials and methods, and  Supplementary Note S2 for additional details). First, we extracted the intronic SE library related measurements of 215 introns. Next, we looked at the TDR and TDR Z-score profiles of two subgroups of endogenous introns in correspondence to their YiFP expression levels: 80 genes with the highest levels and 80 genes with the lowest levels; each group accounts for ~33% of the synthetic library intronome. As can be seen in Fig. 5C , in the pre-STOP domain there is evidence of significant relation between selection for codons with high TE (i.e. TDR) and high SE (Z = 3.49 for high YiFP vs. Z = -0.29 for low YiFP; additional information can be found in  Supplementary Table S2 ). This and the previous results demonstrate the coupling between the different gene expression steps and aspects: highly expressed genes are expected to undergo stronger selection for all gene expression aspects, including translation cost/efficiency and splicing cost/efficiency. Specifically, introns of highly expressed genes are expected to be more optimal in terms of their SE and their TE. Evidence that selective pressure on TE near the 5 ' SS and upstream from the first STOP codon in S. pombe is not function specific An intriguing question is whether the previously shown intronic translation features are not related to the regulation of specific functional gene groups, and can be detected in various gene groups. To this end, we used GO and analysed the retained peptide length, tAI profiles, and tAI Z-scores mentioned in the previous sections in S. pombe for 90 different GO terms separately (see Materials and methods). As can be seen in Fig. 6 for genes of various biological processes, analysis of the STOP codon distance from the 5'SS demonstrates that the average retained peptide length is lower in 61% of the gene functions for the actual intronome in comparison to the randomized ones ( Fig . 6A ; 79%/76% for molecular function and cellular component, respectively;  Supplementary Fig. S9 ; 22% of the terms exhibit selection levels with empirical P -value P  <  0.1; Fig. 6B and C ; 29% for both molecular function and cellular component,  Supplementary Fig. S9 ). In addition, and consistent with previous results, the highest tAI values are found upstream from the 5'SS in most cases; naturally and as expected, the tAI values drop in the pre-STOP domain, however, these values are significant higher than the values in the post-STOP domain (which have the smallest tAI values). This result suggests a partial adaptation to the translation process at the pre-STOP domain and minimum or no adaptation to the translation process at the post-STOP domain. In addition, the Z-score profiles in the pre-STOP domain exhibit higher selection levels for most cases ( Fig. 6D and E ), supporting the conjecture above. Finally, 71%/61%/85% of the gene functions in biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, respectively, show significantly higher values in comparison of the pre-STOP and post-STOP domains ( P  <  0.05 for all cases, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; results for molecular function and cellular component can be seen in  Supplementary Fig. S9 ; see details in Materials and methods, and also a list of the included and excluded terms in  Supplementary Table S3 ). Altogether, these results suggest that the signal reported in the previous sections is not function specific or limited to a small group of genes with specific function, but rather tends to appear in genes with various functions.  GO terms analysis in S. pombe reveals that retained introns translation preference is not unique to genes with a very specific function. (A--–C) Summary of retained peptide length (A) and Z-score corresponding to peptide length relatively to randomized models (B) for biological process demonstrates that in 61% of the gene groups there is preference for a STOP codon closer to the 5'SS. (C) Statistical analysis indicates that the empirical P -value related to the observed signal is <0.1 in 22% of the examined gene groups (see Materials and methods). (D and E) Summary of average tAI (D) and Z-score corresponding to tAI levels relatively to randomized models (E; in absolute values) profiles in the pre-mRNA domains for biological process demonstrates that in various gene groups there is preference for higher tAI values at the beginning of introns in comparison to the region downstream from the first intronic STOP codon; statistical analysis indicates that the observed signal is significant in 71% of the examined gene groups ( P  <  0.05 for all cases, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; see Materials and methods). Thus, the reported signal is universal and not related to any one functional gene group.

Thus, the reported signal is universal and not related to any one functional gene group. RP analysis in budding yeast demonstrates higher ribosome density at the beginning of introns compared to downstream from the first intronic STOP codon To further demonstrate that the beginning of introns tends to be partially but considerably translated, we utilized S. cerevisiae RP experimental information. The RP method is currently one of the most promising approaches for studying gene translation; 60 it provides a quantitative measure of ribosome translation status for every nucleotide in the genome at any given moment (see details in Fig. 7A–D and in the Materials and methods). In order to estimate the translation levels of retained introns we compared the RD before and after the first intronic STOP codon. Specifically, the analysis was performed based on the RP footprint RC information in these regions in a per nucleotide resolution, through alignments around the 5'SS and first intronic STOP codon, averaging over the entire intronome (see Materials and methods and  Supplementary Fig. S10 ). As expected, the mean RC values in the exons upstream of the 5'SS are around two orders of magnitude higher than the values at the intronic downstream side (  Supplementary Fig. S11 ). Analysis of the region surrounding the first intronic STOP codon shows that mean RC values upstream of the termination point were 2.56 times significantly higher than those downstream from it ( Fig. 7E ; mean RC of 6.39·10 -2 before vs. 2.54·10 -2 after the first intronic STOP codon; P  = 1.42·10 -9 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the upstream and downstream values per gene; see also  Supplementary Table S1 ). Interestingly, analysis of the mean RC in the 3' UTR (3.47·10 -2 ; after the annotated STOP and the end of the coding region), found similar levels to the ones detected in the intronic post-STOP domain (2.54·10 -2 ). This result supports the conjecture that the intronic STOP codons function in a similar manner as the annotated STOP, in the case where introns are properly spliced; thus, the level of RC detected at the intronic post-STOP domain is similar to the ‘background noise’ of the RP method. Furthermore, examination of RD in alignment to the second intronic STOP codon does not show any significant difference ( Fig. 7F ; mean RC of 2.47·10 -2 before vs. 2.35·10 -2 after the second intronic STOP codon; P  = 0.21, Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the upstream and downstream values per gene; see Materials and methods), further supporting the conjecture that indeed the observed signal near the first intronic STOP codon is related to genuine intronic translation.  RP analysis of S. cerevisiae . The RP method gives quantitative information of RD in a single nucleotide resolution. (A) Cells are treated (for example) with cycloheximide to arrest translating ribosomes; (B and C) RNA fragments protected from RNases by the ribosome are isolated and processed for Illumina high-throughput sequencing; (D) Based on the sequence reads, it is possible to computationally infer various biophysical properties related to the translation-elongation process. Ribosomal footprint RCs of a certain codon are generated when the codon is covered by ribosomes. Thus, highly translated genes tend to create a higher number of reads. (E) The mean RC values upstream from the first intronic STOP codon (pre-STOP side, left of the Termination Point) shows higher values compared with downstream mean RC values (post-STOP side, right of the Termination Point; 6.39 × 10 -2 before vs. 2.54 × 10 -2 after the first intronic STOP codon; P  = 1.42 × 10 -9 , Wilcoxon signed-rank test). (F) The mean RC profile shows no significant difference between the intronic pre-STOP and post-STOP domains (2.47 × 10 -2 before vs. 2.35 × 10 -2 after second intronic STOP codon; P  = 0.21, Wilcoxon signed-rank test); RC A-site offset is 15 nt. (G) RC distribution analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome demonstrates that as much as 40.8% of the yeast genes have lower mean RC values than introns in the pre-STOP domain, while merely 15.77% of the genes have lower mean RC values than introns in the post-STOP domain (see details in Materials and methods).

Further, we evaluated the mean TDR at the pre-STOP domain assuming that due to splicing error rate consequently 1% of the introns are translated (e.g. see Ref. 89 ) To this end, we compared the mean TDR at the pre-STOP domain of the introns to the mean TDR of ORFs with RC that are [0.01 ± 0.005] · [mean RC of ORFs with introns] and found them to be very similar (5.165 vs. 5.148; in comparison the average and STD of the mean TDR over all annotated ORFs are 5.27 and 0.274, respectively). We also compared the mean TDR at the pre-STOP of the introns to the mean TDR of ORFs with similar RC (±10%), to the RC that appears in the pre-STOP domain and found them to be very similar (5.165 vs. 5.231); see also  Supplementary Note S2 .  Finally, as can be seen in Fig. 7G , analysis of the whole S. cerevisiae genome demonstrates that 40.8% of the genes have lower mean RC values than introns in the pre-STOP domain (the relatively high number can be explained by the fact that genes with introns are extremely highly expressed in S. cerevisiae ). These findings are in agreement with our previous results, as they support the conjecture that the intronic regions upstream of the first intronic STOP undergo significantly higher translation than the intronic regions downstream of it. In addition, the intronic translation rate is comparable to translation rates of known ORFs. Thus, these results support the conjecture that the reported intronic sequence features are indeed related to translation. The reported results from the population-genetics point of view The aim of this section is to demonstrate that the reported results are supported by population-genetics considerations. We will start with the conjecture that the 5' end of introns undergo selection for ‘codons’ with better TE, and continue with the conjecture that there is selection for an intronic STOP codon in-frame with the upstream exon and close to the intron 5' end. It was estimated in yeast 78 that the CUB selective coefficient is S  = 2.6 for highly expressed genes (100 copies of the mRNA). This means that the expected frequency P of the optimal codon is: P=1+uve-S-1 , where u and v are the mutation rates from  c 1 to  c 2 and from  c 2 to  c 1 , respectively (  c 1 and  c 2 are two synonymous codons of the same AA). In addition, S  =  4·Ne·s , where Ne is the effective population size and s is the selective pressure. If we assume that u  =  v we get P=1+e-S-1  = 0.93, and since in S. cerevisiae Ne  = 10 7 (see in Ref. 78 ) we get a selective pressure of s  = 6.5·10 -8 for highly expressed genes.  In Ref. 78 they also provide a relation between expression levels and the selection coefficient (see Fig. 2 in this article), and suggest that ‘genes expressed at over one transcript per cell show noticeable, albeit small, signs of selection on codon-usage’. Since ribosomal proteins have the highest expression levels in the cell (e.g. Y over 100 copies), we expect that an error rate of a few percentages x will be comparable to the selection coefficient for codons in genes with expression levels x·y . As can be seen in Ref. 78 , for x ~ 5% (similarly to the RC observed at the intronic 5' end of S. cerevisiae ) the estimated S is around 0.5, and thus the corresponding selective pressure is around s  = 1.25×10 -8 . According to them, this S value is close to the ones estimated for genes in H. Sapiens , Encephalitozoon cuniculi , and Plasmodium falciparum , and is higher than the S value of Mus musculus , where selection for CUB was observed (i.e. the S value is significantly higher than 0 according to Ref. 78 ).  Regarding the second signal, the conclusion is similar: The selection coefficient for a close STOP codon is expected to be higher than for CUB due to the following reasons: (i) Based on TDR/tAI/Metabolic-cost in S. cerevisiae the mean TE or metabolic cost difference between all pairs of (different) codons is 1.4/0.299/19.78, respectively, while the mean improvement in terms of translation rate/metabolic cost when removing a codon is expected to be equal to the mean translation rate/metabolic cost of one codon, which is 5.22/0.387/29.08, respectively. (ii) Mutations that decrease the distance to a STOP codon can decrease it by more than one codon. The relation of the reported results to efficient NMD regulation The fact that the reported signals correspond to a STOP codon close to the intronic 5'SS may also be (partially) related to selection for improved NMD. Specifically, recent studies suggested that longer 3' UTRs following PTC is one factor related to the improvement of NMD efficiency. 90–93 Nevertheless, various lines of evidence support the conjecture that the reported result is at least partially related to translation rather than NMD: (i) According to our analyses of reduced metabolic costs and TE adaption in the beginning of introns, the signal of more ‘efficient’ amino acids and codons before the first intronic STOP is expected to be related to translation and is not expected to be related to NMD. (ii) The average distance between the PTC and the annotated STOP codons is 934.41 nt for S. cerevisiae and 932.36 for Sch. pombe . These results indeed detect a significant signal related to longer 3' UTRs that may be related to improved NMD ( P  = 8.55×10 -8 and P  = 1.25×10 -15 ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the actual and average randomized models values per gene). However, analyses and comparisons to the randomized models gave an average value of 918.38 nt for S. cerevisiae and 926.55 nt for S. pombe , i.e. 1.75% and 0.63% higher, respectively. We believe that the relative small change in the 3' UTR length is not expected to affect the NMD efficiency (in comparison, evaluation of the ratios in the case of average truncated translated intronic length gave 36.78% and 7.95%, respectively; see Fig. 2B and C ).  (iii) The definition of what is considered a ‘long’ 3' UTR is somewhat ambiguous and there is no agreement on the relation between the 3' UTR length and the NMD pathway efficiency. Thus, the mechanism by which PTCs are detected and promote assembly of the UPF-SMG complex is still poorly understood, though seems to be related to the 3' UTR composition, and the relation between the PTC recognition and the actual mRNA decay is not fully understood. 28,29,94,95 (iv) If NMD is the dominant mechanism we expect to see a stronger signal of an intronic STOP near intronic 5'SS in introns further away from the beginning of the coding region; in these introns the increased ratio of the 3' UTR due to a closer intron is expected to be stronger, promoting stronger selection. However, comparison of the average retained peptide length and metabolic costs in S. pombe between the first intron in each gene to the rest of the introns (2,269 vs. 2,478 introns, respectively) showed that the last ones are 25% longer and that the average metabolic cost in the first ones is 22% lower ( P  = 1.94×10 -6 and P  = 3.11×10 -7 , respectively; Wilcoxon rank-sum test;  Supplementary Fig. S15 ). This result demonstrates that the signal is significantly stronger for the first introns in comparison to the rest, supporting the conjecture that NMD is not the most dominant factor here.  (v) Finally, we would like to emphasize that as in many cases reported in the past, a signal or phenomena may be related to multiple rules or reasons. 95 Thus, it is clearly possible that both explanations (translation and NMD) are related to the suggested selection for intronic STOP close to the 5'SS. Discussion Intron retention is seldom found in fungi, and has not been reported in the organisms analysed in this study. However, here, we analyse four fungal genomes and report various novel evidence supporting the conjecture that novel sequence features found near the intronic splice sites are under selective pressure, presumably to reduce the translation costs of retained introns. Specifically, we report the following major results that are observed at the intronome level: (i) We demonstrate that the intronic sequences are selected for a close STOP codon near the 5'SS, presumably to reduce the cost of translating undesired peptides encoded in retained introns. (ii) In association with this outcome, the beginning of introns are selected for codons that improve TE, which resemble the ones that appear in annotated fungal ORFs, and thus probably undergo co-evolution with the tRNA pool. Again, this signal probably improves the fitness of the organism via reducing the translation and metabolic costs of peptides encoded in retained introns. In all of these cases the reported signals were compared to the ones obtained in randomized genomes and were shown to be significantly stronger, supporting the conjecture that they are indeed under selective pressure. (iii) Our analyses demonstrate that in S. cerevisiae there is higher RD at the beginning of introns, before the first intronic STOP codon, rather than downstream of it, supporting the conjecture that this region tends to undergo partial translation. (iv) The reported patterns occur in genes with various cellular functions supporting the conjecture that they are not function specific. (v) We show that the reported patterns are stronger in highly translated/expressed genes and in introns located in the beginning of the ORF, and specifically related to measures directly associated with TE, supporting the conjecture that they are indeed related to TE selection, and not to alternative signals. (vi) We show that the reported signals do not appear at the intronic 3' end or in the region surrounding the second intronic STOP codon. (G) Finally, the level of codons’ TE at the 5' pre-STOP intronic domain is very similar to the one appearing in annotated ORFs with similar ribosome densities/expression levels as in those intronic regions.  While there is an ongoing debate regarding the relation between codon-usage and TE based on the analyses of RP data, 63,96–105 it is important to emphasize that the most recent studies clearly demonstrate the relation between codon-usage and translation-elongation. 63,96,100,103–105 The current understanding is that previous studies did not find such a relation due to various problems and biases, including the nature of RP data, inaccurate analysis of the data, low coverage of the data, and more. 63,100,103–106 The reported signals are observed at the genomic level, but are harder to detect for single introns due to the nature of the studied signals (see further details in the Materials and methods). Therefore, a comparison of the entire intronome to its randomized versions should enable evaluating such a selection. Likewise, other important recent studies in the field have performed analogous analyses. 65,107–111 We believe that the relatively rare translation events accumulate over all introns to yield a phenomena substantial enough to trigger a selective pressure.  It is important to mention that the reported patterns cannot be completely (or trivially) explained by alternative mechanisms related to splicing instead of translation. For example, it was suggested that in some organisms the intronic boundaries include alternative/tandem splice sites; 112 thus, it is possible that the increased TE and RD at the intronic 5' end is due to this phenomenon. However, the study did not include Fungi, which are different in terms of their splicing regulation and effective population size than the analysed organisms; 14,113–116 thus, it is not known whether tandem splice sites tend to occur also in Fungi. In addition, the fact that we did not find similar patterns surrounding the second STOP codon or at the intronic 3'SS ( Fig. 7F1 and Supplementary S13 ) supports the conjecture that the reported signals are at least partially related to translation. These results and the fact that we used CUB measures that are directly related to translation (TDR/tAI) support the conjecture that the reported CUB at the intronic 5' end cannot be fully explained via non-adaptive mechanisms or aspects not related to translation (e.g. minimizing splicing errors or nucleotide synthesis costs). Furthermore, by any means the selection for STOP codons near intronic 5' end cannot be related to tandem splice site signals.  Some studies have suggested that the process of intron splicing is quite efficient (the probability of splicing error is ~1%), that introns in highly expressed genes are spliced more accurately, and that splicing errors trigger NMD which trigger degradation of the mRNA. 89,117 However, only few genes were examined and only in mammals, and it is not clear whether the results are consistent in different conditions or tissues. Since there are changes at the range and order of magnitude in various aspects of gene expression, 118–120 we expect that also in terms of SE the differences may be very high (up to several orders of magnitudes). Here, because many of the analysed genes are highly expressed it is possible that even a translation ratio of 1% (that usually results in NMD) may result in substantial selection pressure that will enable the TE adaptation. Additionally, since the NMD pathway is based on ribosome halting at the premature STOP codon, 121 when considering very large numbers of introns it will ‘cost’ less if the STOP is be closer to the 5' end of the intron. Moreover, our analyses demonstrate that the RD at the S. cerevisiae intronic pre-STOP 5' end (but not in other parts of the introns) is in agreement with the ribosomal densities in a large fraction of the annotated ORFs in this organism; we also show that the mean TDR at the intronic pre-STOP 5' end is very similar to the one obtained for annotated ORFs with ribosomal densities and expression levels (when considering the 1% splicing error rate) at the intronic pre-STOP 5' end. Thus, our results make sense and are in very good agreement also with the experimental evidence suggesting that the splicing error rate is 1% (see also  Supplementary Note S1 ). An intriguing question for further research is whether there is a difference between wild type and NMD mutants with regard to ribosome footprinting patterns and translation of retained introns.  One may also wonder why evolution does not optimize splicing such that there will be no splicing errors at all, and therefore no need for translation optimization of introns; specifically, this solution may sound energetically cheaper and more ‘elegant’. A possible explanation to this “quandary” includes the fact that ‘evolutionary selection’ works more like a ‘tinkerer’ (mutation <U+2192> selection <U+2192> mutation <U+2192> selection, etc.) that converge to local solutions rather than like an ‘engineer’ (that can find the globally optimal solution), due to various constraints and multiple variables involved in splicing and translation. Therefore, in our opinion it should not be surprising that evolution will ‘converge’ to the suggested ‘solution’. 106,122–124 It is easy to see that various aspects in biological systems are not optimal or can be further optimized. Furthermore, the higher splicing error rate may not ‘be solved’ (in a cheaper manner than the current ‘solution’) due to biophysical constraints and limitations. For example, it is possible that there is a trade-off(s) (as in the case of many other aspects of gene expression) between the ‘speed’ of splicing and its accuracy (a lower error rate may be related to lower splicing ‘speed’, which may eventually be more deleterious than the current state). This fact could be the ‘selective force’ facilitating the partial codon-usage/translation cost optimization. Specifically, we suggest that the improved translation cost of introns contributes towards better organismal fitness. Indeed, translating a larger amount of useless proteins from the aberrantly spliced mRNAs is not expected to be beneficial; however, translating it in a more efficient manner is ‘better’/‘cheaper’ than translating it using non-efficient codons; on the other hand, completely eliminating these cases is also impossible due to possible higher (in terms of organismal fitness) negative SE or other/additional costs (and the nature of the evolutionary process which tend to converges to local optima).ConclusionsOne central conclusion of this study is that the classification to exons and introns in fungi is continuous rather than discrete, i.e. introns may also be translated to a certain degree. Moreover, it could make sense to classify many of the fungal intron-containing transcripts as alternatively spliced; while in many cases introns are spliced as defined, there are considerably abundant examples (enough to trigger translational preference on introns) where an intron is retained and subsequently a shorter peptide or protein is translated. Therefore, it will be interesting to study various properties of these putative shorter proteins. Another principle conclusion is that functional silent mutations related to translation may appear in regions traditionally not classified as translated regions (e.g. introns). Our results support various recent studies in the field that have suggested that synonymous and silent mutations are functional. 83,125–127 However, we emphasize for the first time, the role of CUB also in non-coding parts of the transcript such as introns. Insights from the results reported here can be used for developing future models of intronic evolution that will consider the effect of mutations both on SE and the possibility of intronic translation.Conflict of interestNone declared.FundingThis study was supported in part by a fellowship from the Edmond J.

The next-generation sequencing studies of breast cancer have reported that the tumour suppressor P53 ( TP53 ) gene is mutated in more than 40% of the tumours. We studied the levels of oxidative lesions, including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), along the coding strand of the exon 5 in breast cancer patients as well as in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-attacked breast cancer cell line using the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique. We detected a significant ‘ in vitro ’ generation of 8-oxodG between the codons 163 and 175, corresponding to a TP53 region with high mutation prevalence, after treatment with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase, a ROS-generating system. Then, we evaluated the occurrence of oxidative lesions in the DNA-binding domain of the TP53 in the core needle biopsies of 113 of women undergoing breast investigation for diagnostic purpose. An increment of oxidative damage at the -G- residues into the codons 163 and 175 was found in the cancer cases as compared to the controls. We found significant associations with the pathological stage and the histological grade of tumours. As the major news of this study, this largest analysis of genomic footprinting of oxidative lesions at the TP53 sequence level to date provided a first roadmap describing the signatures of oxidative lesions in human breast cancer. Our results provide evidence that the generation of oxidative lesions at single nucleotide resolution is not an event highly stochastic, but causes a characteristic pattern of DNA lesions at the site of mutations in the TP53 , suggesting causal relationship between oxidative DNA adducts and breast cancer. 1. Introduction Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in women, 1 affecting approximately one in eight women during their lifetime. 2 So far, a number of risk factors of breast cancer have been discovered, including reproductive and hormonal factors, family history of breast cancer, alcohol consumption, obesity and overweight. 3 Knowledge of how such risk factors induce cancer is not well defined, but it appears that an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated to increased breast cancer risk. 4–6 ROS are highly reactive intermediates, which cause various kind of oxidative DNA lesions, including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 3-(2-deoxy-ß-D-erythropentafuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2-a]purin-10(3H)-one–deoxyguanosine adducts, 7 important hallmarks in carcinogenesis. 8 The central question is whether oxidative DNA adducts, in the breast, truly cause cancer. If so, lowering them would reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Conversely, whether the oxidative lesions are caused by tumour progression, and thereby they are just a bystander, so reducing their frequency would not truly lower cancer risk.  One of the central pieces of the genome that is often damaged in cancer cells is the tumour suppressor P53 ( TP53 ), involved in the cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis. 9 Inactivating mutations in the TP53 are the main genetic events in the sporadic cancers with the vast majority arising from a single point mutation in the segment encoding the DNA-binding domain of the TP53.10 Somatic TP53 mutations have been detected in almost every type of sporadic cancers at rates from 38% to 50% 11 and the first next-generation sequencing studies of breast cancer have found that the TP53 is mutated in more than 40% of the tumours. 12 Nevertheless, William Thilly has shown that mutation spectra can vary with dose and thereby such spectra are limited in the ability to define their origins. Also, people are always exposed to mixtures of environmental carcinogens.  Genotoxic carcinogens, including ROS, are known to produce characteristic patterns of somatic mutations in the DNA of malignant cells, which are generally preceded by the generation of characteristic patterns of DNA lesions at the site of mutations, as exemplified by the 8-oxodG, that, if unrepaired, may result in G:C to T:A transversions and, at lesser extent, in G:C to AT transitions. 8,13 Somatic mutation theory may explain how DNA lesions in genomic DNA lead to the malignant transformation of cells. The ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) assay is a method of choice for the genomic footprinting of human genomic DNA, 14 because it can be used to quantitatively investigate single-strand DNA breaks having phosphorylated 5'-ends within single-copy DNA sequences.  Our current aims were to investigate whether cancer related genes have altered frequencies of oxidative lesions in cancer susceptibility regions and to evaluate whether oxidative DNA adducts truly cause breast cancer. We examined the levels of oxidative DNA lesions, including of 8-oxodG, along the coding strand of the exon 5 of the TP53 in MDA-MB23 oestrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cells after treatment with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase, a ROS-generating system. The genomic footprinting was performed using the LMPCR technique 15 with some modifications accordingly to Davies and Murray. 16 The enzymatic cleavage of DNA was obtained by the treatment with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) and endonuclease III (EndoIII), two Escherichia coli repair enzymes that recognize various types of oxidative damage. 17,18 The generation of oxidative DNA damage in the experimental cells was also analysed using the 32 P-postlabelling technique. 19 Next, we conducted a hospital-based study for evaluating the occurrence of oxidative DNA lesions at the TP53 sequence level in the core needle biopsies of 113 of women undergoing breast investigation for diagnostic purpose. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culture and DNA isolation The MDA-MB23 ER- breast cells were grown under standard conditions in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator and treated at 30–40% confluence with 0.2 mM xanthine plus 1.0 or 5.0 mU xanthine oxidase for 24 h. DNA was isolated using a method requiring RNase and proteinase treatments and extraction with organic solvents. 20 After DNA concentration and purity determination, coded samples were stored at -80 °C. 2.2. Study populationBreast cancer cases and controls were recruited among women undergoing breast investigation for diagnostic purpose at the Senology Unit. After being informed of the purpose of the study and signed an informed written consent, core needle biopsies were collected under radiographic guidance by interventional radiologists, snap-frozen and stored at -80°C until laboratory analysis. A questionnaire was completed by each participant after biological sampling collection. Histopathological diagnosis and laboratory test findings were obtained from the Pathological Anatomy Unit. Study procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the General Hospital Institutional Committee that reviewed and approved the protocol.2.3. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain assay The levels of oxidative lesions have been analysed along the exon 5 using the LMPCR technique 15 with some modifications. 16 The melting temperatures (  T m ) of the primers were calculated by the method of the nearest-neighbor, 21 according to Allawi and SantaLucia. 22DNA template (2 µg, 0.4 µg/µl) was incubated with a mix of reaction buffer (10 ×), 0.4 U Fpg (0.2 U/µl) and 200 U EndoIII (100 U/µl) at 37 °C for 60 min (final volume 10 µl) to create fragments with 5'-phosphate groups at the sites of DNA lesions. The fragments containing ligatable breaks were amplified with 16.0 pmol of a primer with the following sequence 5'-GGCAACCAGCCCTGTCG and a calculated  T m of 56 °C, in a mix of 3 U Thermococcus litoralis exo- (Vent exo-) DNA polymerase (2 U/µl), 23 0.6 mM dNTPs and 0.5 mM MgSO 4 . The following program was performed: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, annealing at 54 °C for 2 min and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min (1 cycle) followed by 20 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 54 °C and 3 min at 72 °C. The blunt ended fragments with 5'-phosphate termini were overnight incubated with a mix of ligase buffer (10×), 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (added as 10 mg/ml), 60 pmol of the asymmetric double-stranded unphosphorylated linker, and 90 U T4 ligase (400 U/µl) at 17 °C (final volume 30 µl) for generating a common sequence at all 5'-ends. After ligation, the linker-ligated fragments were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure in a speed-vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 10 µl of ultrapure water. PCR amplification has been combined with direct labelling according to Davies and Murray. 16 The amplification and labelling reactions were achieved with 12.0 pmol of a IRDye ® 700/800 fluorescence-labelled primer with the following sequence 5'-TCTCTCCAGCCCCAGCTGCTCAC and a calculated  T m of 61 °C and 12.0 pmol of the LP25 universal linker primer in a mix of 1 U of Vent exo- (2 U/µl), 0.3 mM dNTPs and 2.5 mM MgSO 4 . The following PCR conditions were utilized: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min (1 cycle), followed by 10 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 3 min at 59 °C and 3 min at 72 °C.  The IRDye ® 700/800 fluorescence-labelled products (2 µl) were denaturated with formamide loading buffer (3 µl) at 95 °C for 5 min (final volume 5 µl), and, after 10 min on ice, denaturated labelled products (1 µl) were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel, 80.0% acrylamide, 10% bis-acrylamide/urea and run in the LI-COR 4300 DNA analyzer at 65 °C for 7 h. DNA lesions were identified as the locations in which the presence of Fpg and EndoIII-sensitive sites stopped the Vent exo- from progressing and resulted in an intense dark band. The relative band intensity (RI), quantificated by ImageQuant, were calculated by following formula RI = I j /I max , where I j is the intensity in pixels of each band after background subtraction and I max is the mean intensity in pixels of the highest intensity bands. 24 The RI values were corrected across experiments based on the recovery of the reference standard. The exact position of each base was determined by including labelled DNA fragments obtained by sequencing of the region of interest according to Ruano and Kidd 25 and appropriate size IRDye ® 700/800 sizing standards markers in the sequencing gel. 2.4. 32 P-DNA postlabelling assay The levels of 3-(2-deoxy-ß-D-erythro-pentafuranosyl)pyrimido [1,2-a]purin-10(3H)-one deoxyguanosine (M 1 dG) adducts in the experimental cells were measured using a version of the 32 P-DNA postlabelling assay, 19 that has been developed for the specific detection of M 1 dG adducts. 26 The levels of DNA damage were expressed as relative adduct labelling  = pixels in adducted nucleotides/pixels in normal nucleotides. Adduct levels were corrected across experiments based in the recovery of the reference standard, which has been prepared as previously reported. 272.5. Statistical analysis Given the right-skewed distribution of the data, adduct levels were log-transformed to stabilize the variance and normalize the distribution. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare experimental groups in the ‘ in vitro ’ studies. The association of oxidative lesions with breast cancer was evaluated by the analysis of covariance, including terms for age (continuous), menopausal status and smoking history (non-smokers, current smokers), to estimate the effect of each variable on the outcome adjusting for the concomitant effect of the other variables included in the model. The analysis of covariance was also applied to examine the difference between the levels of oxidative DNA lesions according to the pathological diameter, the histologic cell grade and the frequency of hormonal receptors positive to oestrogen and progesterone. Post hoc Dunnett tests were performed for multiple comparisons among variable levels. All statistical tests were two-sided and P  < 0.05 has been considered to be statistically significant. The data were analysed using SPSS 13.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, New York, NY). 3. Results3.1. Xanthine plus xanthine oxidase treatment To look for the genomic footprints caused by electrophilic compounds in experimental cells treated with the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system, we measured the levels of oxidative lesions along the coding strand of the exon 5 using the LMPCR assay. Figure 1 reports a representative map of the area with the cluster of oxidative DNA lesion products at the TP53 sequence level after treatment with 0.2 mM xanthine plus 5.0 mU xanthine oxidase system. The sequencing gel shows that various bases were hotspots for oxidative DNA damage between the codons 163 and 175. Other DNA damage sites were not observed. After showing the production of DNA damage at the DNA sequence level, we tried to quantify the levels of oxidative lesions at single nucleotide resolution following exposure of the same cell line to various doses of the ROS-generating system. The mean levels of oxidative lesions, expressed as RI, 24 at selected positions of representative codons of the TP5311 were reported in Table 1 . Significant dose-response relationships were found at the –T–and –G– residues into the codons 163, 170, 173 and 175, with the highest levels of DNA damage in the experimental cells treated with the highest dosage of the free radical-generating system, and with the lower levels in those exposed to the intermediate dosage. In cells without exposure to the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system, a background level of oxidative DNA damage was found. The presence of oxidative damaged DNA in the experimental cells treated with increased concentration of the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system was confirmed by the analysis of M 1 dG adducts, a biomarker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, 28,–30 using the 32 P-postlabelling technique. We observed that the frequency of M 1 dG was significantly increased within the cells treated with the ROS-generating system as compared to controls. The mean levels of M 1 dG adducts × 10 6 normal nucleotides were 2.87 ± 0.59 and 0.38 ± 0.10 of the treated cells and the controls, respectively, P  = 0.007 ( Table 1 ). A significant dose-response relationship was observed, P-value for trend  < 0.001.

Breast cancer case-control study The core needle biopsies were obtained from 113 women, average aged 58.8 ± 15.5 yrs. Seventy-three women were confirmed as having breast cancer from histopatological analysis. Forty women with benign breast lesions were considered as controls. Nineteen women were classified as smokers. Breast cancer case and benign breast disease groups were comparable in terms of age, 60.6 yrs ± 15.0 ( s . d .) vs. 55.7 yrs ± 16.1 ( s . d .), respectively.  Having validated the use of the LMPCR assay and having showed that the ROS-generating system can produce highly localized damage in experimental cells, we tried to quantify the generation of oxidative lesions along the coding strand of the exon 5 of the TP53 in the study population. Our results show that a cluster of oxidative DNA lesions, including 8-oxodG, was present between the codons 170 and 173. A representative sequencing gel in Fig. 1 shows that specific bases were consistently hotspots for oxidative DNA damage in the breast cancer cases as compared to the controls. Other hotspots for oxidative DNA damage were not observed. The average levels of oxidative lesions, expressed as RI, 24 at the levels of selected nucleotides of representative codons of the TP5311 were reported in Table 2 . Our findings indicate that significant enhancements of the levels of 8-oxodG into the codons 170 and 173 were detected in the breast cancer cases as compared to the controls ( Table 2 ). Specifically, the levels of oxidative lesions at the –T– position into the codon 163 of the cancer cases and the controls were 0.19 ± 0.02 and 0.15 ± 0.01, respectively, P  = 0.493 after adjusting for age, menopausal status and smoking history; the values of 8-oxodG at the –G– residue into the codon 170 of the breast cancer cases and the controls were 0.51 ± 0.04 and 0.30 ± 0.02, respectively, P  = 0.012 after correction for the confounding factors; the levels of 8-oxodG at the first –G – position into the codon 173 of the breast cancer patients and the controls were 0.44 ± 0.04 and 0.28 ± 0.02, respectively, P  = 0.039 after adjusting for the confounding factors; and the levels of 8-oxodG at the –G – residue into the codon 175 of the cancer patients and the controls were 0.23 ± 0.02 and 0.18 ± 0.01, respectively, P  = 0.270 after correction for the confounding factors.

When the pathologic stage of the breast tumours was examined, significant increments of oxidative lesions at the –G– positions into the codons 170, 173 and 175 with increased pathological stage were found ( Table 2 ). Significant trends were also observed. In detail, the levels of oxidative lesions at single nucleotide resolution were 0.41 ± 0.11 and 0.15 ± 0.01 at the –T– residue into the codon 163 of the breast cancer cases with a pT3 stage and the controls, respectively, P  = 0.062 after adjusting for the confounding factors; the values of 8-oxodG were 0.76 ± 0.13 and 0.30 ± 0.02 at the –G– position into the codon 170 of the breast cancer cases with a pT3 stage and the controls, respectively, P  = 0.025 after correction for the confounding factors; the levels of 8-oxodG were 0.73 ± 0.19 and 0.28 ± 0.02 at the first –G– residue into the codon 173 of the breast cancer patients with a pT3 stage and the controls, respectively, P  = 0.037 after adjusting for the confounding factors; and the amounts of 8-oxodG were 0.46 ± 0.09 and 0.18 ± 0.01 at the –G– position into the codon 175 of the cancer patients with a pT3 stage and in the controls, respectively, P  = 0.012 after correction for the confounding factors. Statistically significant relationships were observed at the –G– residues into the codons 170, 173 and 175 with the highest levels of 8-oxodG in the patients with a pT3 stage, and intermediate values in those with early stages of cancer ( Table 2 ).  On the other hand, when the histologic cell grade of tumours was analysed, a statistically significant enhancement of 8-oxodG levels into the codon 170 was observed with increasing grading ( Table 2 ), but with the highest levels of DNA damage at the –G– residues into the codons 173 and 175 in patients with a G2 value. Significant trends of 8-oxodG generation into the codons 170 and 173 with increasing grade were found ( Table 2 ). In detail, the levels of 8-oxodG were 0.54 ± 0.06, 0.64 ± 0.06 and 0.30 ± 0.02 at the –G– residue into the codon 170 in the breast cancer cases with G3 and G2 values and the controls, respectively, P  < 0.013 and P  < 0.001 after correction for the confounding factors. 4. Discussion4.1. Single nucleotide TP53 lesions and free radicals We evaluated the genomic footprints caused along the coding strand of the exon 5 of the TP53 , a gene highly mutated in breast cancer, 11 from the treatment with increased doses of the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system using the LMPCR technique. The xanthine oxidase is an enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine into uric acid and uses oxygen as redox partner by producing various ROS, including superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide. As result, we observed a significant production of 8-oxodG between the codons 163 and 175 in the experimental cells ( Fig. 1 ) corresponding to a region of the TP53 with high mutation rates. 11 The presence of oxidative damage in the experimental cells treated with the ROS-generating system was confirmed using the 32 P-postlabelling technique. 19 After treatment with increased concentrations of the ROS-generating system, the production of oxidative lesions was increased of about 9-fold half level ( Table 1 ), supporting that the damage at single nucleotide resolution results from ROS attack. Overall, our findings presented here indicate that the interaction of electrophilic species with genomic DNA causes the generation of oxidative DNA damage in a susceptible region along the coding sequence of the exon 5. Our results are consistent with the previous reports of Rodriguez et al. 31 and Arakawa et al., 24 that analysed the frequency of oxidative lesions at the TP53 sequence level after hydrogen peroxide treatment in ‘ in vitro ’ studies. In particular, Arakawa et al. 24 reported that ROS treatment induced a similar pattern of fingerprints of oxidative DNA lesions within the exon 5. 4.2. Single nucleotide TP53 lesions and breast cancer Having shown the production of base damage at the TP53 sequence level after ROS attack, we have focused on the largest analysis of genomic footprinting in humans to date. Our next result provides evidence that the generation of oxidative lesions at single nucleotide resolution is not an event highly stochastic with an overall low frequency, but causes site-specific DNA damage inducing a characteristic pattern of DNA lesions at the site of mutations in the TP53 . This supports causal relationship between oxidative DNA lesions and breast cancer. Indeed, as expected, the mapping of the exon 5 indicates the presence of a cluster of oxidative damage between the codons 163 and 175 in the cancer patients as compared to the controls ( Fig. 1 ). Although codon 175, known as one of the mutation hot spots in breast cancers, 11 also exhibited the highest adduction rate in the breast cancer cases, no apparent difference is shown regarding the incidence of oxidative lesions between codons 163 and 175 ( Table 2 ). Taken together, our results show the existence of a cluster of hotspots of DNA damage at the TP53 sequence level, that can be explained by a higher susceptibility of particular sites to be attacked from electrophilic compounds. 8 Additionally, the fingerprint map of the breast cancer patients was comparable to that observed in the experimental cells treated with the ROS-generating system ( Fig. 1 ). In particular, the amounts of oxidative damage at the –G– residues into the codons 170 and 173 were significantly increased in the breast cancer patients as compared to healthy tissues ( Table 2 ). The fact that the exon 5 of the TP53 can be targeted to unique sites in the genome of breast cancer patients will be of considerable value. The increased levels of oxidative DNA damage along the DNA-binding domain can indeed be considered a cancer risk factor, since if unrepaired, they can lead to various mutations and subsequently trigger breast carcinogenesis. This depends on whether the oxidation causes cancer or the generation of oxidative DNA damage is influenced by early effects of cancer itself. 4.3. Single nucleotide TP53 lesions and prognostic factors Enhanced levels of 8-oxodG at the TP53 sequence level were also significantly associated with conventional prognostic factors such as the pathological stage and the histological grade of breast tumours, indicating that high levels of 8-oxodG may exert detrimental effects during cancer development and tumour progression. Nevertheless, the possibility that ROS act such as a form of endogenous chemotherapy during tumour progression cannot be excluded. This association was even more evident at the –G– residue into the codon 170 of the patients with poorly differentiated tumours of >50 mm dimension ( Table 2 ). Consistent with our results, a main role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of oestrogen-induced breast cancer has been suggested. 32 Earlier studies have discovered augmented levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress in either urine and tumour tissue DNA. 4,5,33–35 Recently, high 8-oxodG has been associated to subsequent risk of breast. 5 Also, we have conducted a hospital-based study to analyse the amount of M 1 dG, a biomarker of oxidative stress, 29,30,36 in breast cancer patients. 4 In that study, we found a significant association between M 1 dG and breast cancer, as well as with increasing the degree of differentiation and severity of cancer. Various underlying mechanisms are involved in the generation of oxidative DNA lesions, such as the oestrogens, 34 that are metabolically activated into catechol oestrogens from the cytochrome P450 enzymes. 37 Metabolic redox cycling between catechol oestrogens and their corresponding quinones can generate oxidative stress and ROS. 34 Chronic inflammation associated to adiposity 3 as well activated inflammatory neutrophils 38 can also induce ROS. 4.4. TP53 genomic fooprinting As the major news of this study, this largest analysis of genomic footprinting of oxidative lesions at the TP53 sequence level to date provided a first roadmap describing the signatures of oxidative lesions in human breast cancer. Remarkably, our results indicate that the LMPCR technique 15 a versatile DNA-lesion footprinting technique, which enables sensitive and specific detection of oxidative DNA damage at the level of sequence resolution, may be used for evaluating cancer risk in future clinical and epidemiological studies. In particular, the current LMPCR procedure involved the combination of PCR amplification with direct labelling developed by Davies and Murray. 16 Furthermore, this system will allow detailed analysis of the effects of site-specific DNA lesions on cellular functions. 4.5. Single nucleotide TP53 lesions and mutation prevalence Data on mutation prevalence in breast cancer may be easily accessed through the IARC TP53 database, 11 therefore, we examined the levels of oxidative DNA lesions at single nucleotide resolution to the frequencies of mutations in the same positions along the DNA-binding domain 11 in the attempt of evaluating the potential mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Table 3 shows that the generation of oxidative DNA damage along the DNA-binding domain of the TP53 was found in sites where the prevalence of transversion and transition mutations was ranging from 0.28% to 4.52%. The occurrence of special mutation patterns might suggest of the nature of the mutagens that have caused them. In this case, the mutation spectra reveal some of the characteristics expected from the effects of ROS exposure on DNA. It was apparent that the generation of 8-oxodG associated to the principal mutagenic events generated by this compound, 13 may be in part responsible of the induction of these TP53 mutations. Theoretically, the colocalization of DNA lesions and mutational hotspots in the TP53 gene may be used for causality inference. This interpretation is further strengthened by previous findings reporting that G:C<U+2192>T:A tranversions derived from 8-oxodG have been found in malignant tumours. 8 Of course, other models have indicated that the deamination of 5-methylcytosine in methylated CpG sequences may be a mechanisms of CpG transitions. 39 Interestingly, the process of 5-methylcytosine deamination may be enhanced by the exposure to ROS, especially in cancers arising from inflammatory precursors. 40 These elements suggest that the present spectra of oxidative lesions may theoretically account for at least a part a percentage of the TP53 mutations present in breast tumours.

Conclusions The integration of DNA adduct data with cancer mutations, as exemplified in our report, may provide an improved knowledge of the complex relationship between the TP53 gene and breast cancer development and progression. Considering that DNA-lesion footprinting in conjunction with mutation analysis are used to correlate DNA damage and mutagenesis and to demonstrate causality inference, we may argue that oxidative lesions occurring at the –G– residues into the codons 170 and 173 might serve as a necessary hit required to drive the process of breast carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Our study provides evidence that the production of oxidative lesions at the TP53 sequence level is not an event stochastic, but induce a characteristic spectrum of DNA adducts at the site of mutations, supporting causal relationship between oxidative DNA lesions and breast cancer. Also, the data suggest the possibility that the level of oxidative DNA lesions may be a prognostic factor in breast cancer. Analysing the generation of DNA damage at single nucleotide resolution will serve as a foundation for future work examining the mechanisms of oxidative DNA damage in breast carcinogenesis.

IntroductionFlower induction and initiation are the key developmental stages for flowering plants. Recently, extensive analyses performed in Arabidopsis have provided a complex picture of how these plants integrate environmental and endogenous signals to regulate the flowering transition.1 Several flowering regulatory pathways function to promote or repress flowering depending on the environmental and endogenous conditions identified, such as photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellins, autonomous, and ageing pathways.1,2 The balance of signals from these flowering pathways is integrated by a common set of genes, such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), LEAFY (LFY), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), and could regulate the transition from the juvenile to the adult phase.3,4 This knowledge has greatly accelerated research related to flowering in perennial plants.5 However, when homologous genes from perennial plants were analysed, differences regarding expression patterns and phenotypes were detected when compared with Arabidopsis, and these differences may reflect roles distinct from those described in model plants.2,6 These studies indicated that the underlying molecular mechanism of flowering time may differ between perennial and model plants because of different flowering characteristics, such as long juvenile phase and seasonal flowering; some novel genes may also play a key role in these processes. Therefore, an understanding of these different characteristics requires identification and characterization of novel genes related to these characteristics in woody plants.Citrus is one of the most economically important evergreen crops for the production of fresh fruit and juice; its economic and social impact on our society is tremendous.7–9 However, the flowering transition of most citrus plants is 6–8 yr, and for some species such as seedling oranges and grapefruit it is 8–10 yr.8 However, commercially important traits of citrus are expressed primarily in fruit tissue. This requires the trees to be capable of flowering and producing fruit to evaluate functions of these genes. Precocious trifoliate orange, a spontaneous mutant with a short juvenile phase from WT trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) was found in Yichang, Hubei Province, China.10 Approximately 20% of the seedlings from the mutant seeds first flowered during the year after the spring planting; the juvenile period of the mutant has been greatly reduced to 1– 2 yr when compared with the WT plants, which have a juvenile period of 6– 8 yr.10,11 Precocious trifoliate orange and its wild type have nearly the same morphology, except for the flowering habit, and no DNA polymorphism has been detected between them based on some molecular markers.10–12 Therefore, precocious trifoliate orange is speculated to be a direct variant of the wild type. Previous transcriptional studies including suppression subtraction hybridization combined with macroarray and massively parallel signature sequencing were used to investigate transcriptome changes between the mutant (MT) and its wild type (WT), and several differentially expressed genes were detected.11,13 However, it remains largely unknown what kind of mechanism results in early flowering.The recent release of the citrus genome9,14 and next-generation DNA sequencing technology15 will dramatically enhance the efficiency of functional and comparative genomics research in citrus. The alignment of the short reads obtained from the MT and the WT to the citrus reference genome has provided the perfect opportunity to identify a large number of genetic variations between the MT and the WT, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion and deletion polymorphisms (InDels), and structural variations (SVs). Here, we sequenced the genome of the MT and the WT; several putative genetic variations including SNPs, InDels, and SVs were identified. The frequency and distribution of these genetic variations in different regions of gene were also identified. In addition, we developed a great deal of effective DNA markers for exploring genetic diversity in the citrus genus.2. Methods2.1. Plant materialsAll samples from 32 citrus species (fortunella; kumquat; trifoliate orange; precocious trifoliate orange; flying dragon trifoliate orange; citranges; Fenghuang pummelo; Kaopan pummelo; grapefruit; Hirado Buntan pummelo; guoqing no. 1 satsuma; Qingjiang Ponkan; Bendiguangju mandarin; Miyagawa wase satsuma; red tangerine; calamondin; Clementine mandarin; Newhall navel orange; Valencia orange; Jingcheng sweet orange; Honganliu sweet orange; sour orange; Cara Cara navel orange; Washington navel orange; blood orange; Ichang papeda; papeda; citron; bergamot; Mexican lime; lemon; and rough lemon) were collected in the experiment fields of the National Citrus Breeding Center at Huazhong Agricultural University. To identify flowering-related genetic variation at the transcriptional level, the terminal bud and the five following buds (the major node position for flower formation) from spring flushes of the MT and the WT 2-yr-old trees were also collected at flower initiation (after self-pruning). Previous cytological studies revealed that the floral buds of spring shoots in 2-yr-old precocious trifoliate orange initiated differentiation immediately after self-pruning, but its WT did not.16 To eliminate the influence of the genetic background, the materials used for genome re-sequencing and RNA-seq from the same 2-yr-old trees in this study. All materials for RNA and DNA extraction were collected from three individual plants. All plant tissues were sampled according to the demands of each experiment, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until used.2.2. DNA isolation and genome sequencingPlant DNA of all material was isolated from the leaf according to the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method.17 For genome resequencing, the DNA from the MT and the WT were randomly sheared. After electrophoresis, DNA fragments of the desired length were gel-purified. Adaptor ligation and DNA cluster preparation were performed and subjected to Solexa sequencing using Illumina Genome Analyzer II.18 Low-quality reads (<20), reads with an adaptor sequence, and duplicated reads were filtered, and the remaining high-quality data were used for mapping. Raw sequence data obtained in our study have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive with accession number SRP070975.2.3. Detection of SNPs, InDels, and SVsThe sequencing reads from the MT and the WT were aligned to the Clementine genome (http://www.phytozome.net/clementine.php) separately using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software.19 Reads that aligned to more than one position of the reference genome were filtered and used for determining reads mapping to multiple positions in the reference and unmapped reads. Average sequencing depth and coverage were calculated using the alignment results.20 The mapped reads were then used to detect SNPs, InDels, and SVs using SOAPsnp and SOAPsv software with default parameter settings.20–22 The SNPs identified were filtered based on the following stringent criteria: no less than two times for coverage depth (no less than three times in the heterozygous locus), no more than three times of average depth, distance of adjacent variation had to be >5 bp, and target mapping quality had to be >20. For the InDels, gaps supported by at least three pair-end (PE) reads were retained. For obtaining reliable SVs, the detected SVs must be returned to the PE alignments between resequencing genome and the reference genome and be validated under the following criteria: 2× to 100× for coverage depth and >20 for SVs quality.2.4. Annotation of SNPs, InDels, and SVsLocalization of the SNPs, InDels, and SVs was based on the annotation of gene models of the Clementine genome (http://www.phytozome.net/clementine.php). The three types of polymorphisms in the gene region and other genome regions were annotated as genic and intergenic, respectively. The genic SNPs, InDels, and SVs were classified as CDS, UTR, and intron according to their localization. The SNPs in the CDS region were further separated into synonymous and non-synonymous amino substitutions using Genewise.23 The Gene Ontology (GO)/PFAM annotation data were further used to functionally annotate each gene including non-synonymous SNPs with 1- to 10-bp lengths.2.5. RNA-Seq data analysesTo prepare a representative sample of total RNA, we pooled three individual plants from approximately equal numbers of the MT and the WT materials, respectively. Total RNA was extracted according to a previous protocol.24 Library construction and sequencing were performed as described by Zenoni et al.25 Low-quality reads (<20), reads with adaptor sequence, and duplicated reads were filtered, and the remaining high-quality data were used in the mapping. The PE sequencing reads were aligned to the citrus reference genome sequence separately using BWA software algorithm under the default parameters as described for genome sequencing. To identify flowering-related genetic variation in the two genotypes, we mapped the reads against the Clementine genome9,14 using the SOAP2 software with default parameter settings as described for genome sequencing.22 These identified SNPs and InDels from RNA-Seq were annotated the genic genetic variation by identified of genome sequencing. A candidate genetic variation was identified by both RNA-Seq and genomic DNA reads, for which the available flanking sequence matched 100% over the entire length at a single location. It will be considered a real variation at the transcriptional level. The RNA-Seq data from this study have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE78810.2.6. Functional assignments of the transcripts containing specific InDelsTo assign putative functions to the MT and the WT containing specific InDel transcripts, Blast2Go program was run to BLAST against a reference database that stores UniProt entries, GO, Enzyme Commission (EC), and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation.26 The GO categorization results were expressed as three independent hierarchies for biological process, cellular component, and molecular function.262.7. New marker screening and polymorphism surveyFor Sanger sequencing, primers spanning genomic regions predicted to contain InDels were used to amplify genomic DNA templates from the Clementine, the MT, and the WT. PCR amplification was conducted in 25-µl reactions containing 50 ng template DNA, 2.5 µM MgCl2, 2.5 µl 10× PCR buffer, 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, and 2.5 mM dNTPs. The PCR cycling profile was 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 60°C for 45 s, 72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Target sequences were recovered and sequenced. For new marker screening, the quality of the PCR product from 32 citrus species was checked by a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 M urea in 0.5× TBE buffer. Three microliters of PCR product was mixed to an equal volume of loading buffer containing 95% formamide, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylen cyanol, and 10 mM EDTA. This mixture was heated for 5 min at 94°C to denature the DNA before loading. Gels were stained with silver nitrate following the protocol described27 for gel electrophoresis analysis and for comparison with the 10-bp DNA standard ladders (Invitrogen).2.8. Genetic diversity and data analysisPOPgene (v1.32) was used to calculate the different statistical and genetic parameters,28 such as the effective allele number,29 Shannon's information index,30 and expected heterozygosity.31 The genetic distance of the InDel genotype was calculated based on Nei's genetic distance measure, with pairwise distance calculated by MEGA 4.32 The polymorphic information content (PIC) value for the InDel marker was calculated thereafter.33 A dendrogram was constructed based on the unweighted pair-group method, with arithmetic mean determined by MEGA4.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and mapping onto the Clementine reference genomeTo identify the genome-wide genetic variation between precocious trifoliate orange and its WT, two resequencing libraries from the two genotypes of trifoliate orange were constructed. The genome size of the Clementine reference genome is 301.4 Mb.9 We estimated that approximately 40-fold genome coverage should be sufficient for aligning most of the sequences. Therefore, 12.22 (143.78 million reads) and 13.16 Gb (159.56 million reads) of sequencing data were generated from the MT and the WT, respectively. Approximately 11.79 Gb (138.68 million clean reads) of filtered sequencing data for the MT and 12.64 Gb (153.23 million clean reads) of data for the WT were aligned to the Clementine genome using BWA software (Supplementary Table S1). The results showed that the genomic GC contents of the MT and the WT were 36.46 and 36.04%, respectively. A summary of the resequencing data is presented in Supplementary Table S1. For the MT and the WT, 61.73 and 63.13% of clean reads were uniquely mapped to the reference genome and translated into 24- and 26-fold effective coverage of the reference sequences, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). These clean reads of the MT and the WT covered approximately 81.16 and 82.30% of the reference sequence, respectively, indicating that the generated data set was highly relevant to the reference genome (Supplementary Table S1). Among citrus 33,929 transcripts, 6.95% and 7.01% reads of sequencing data were mapped 23,543 (69.38%) and 23,821 (70.21%) transcripts from the MT and the WT, respectively.3.2. Detection and characteristics of genetic variations of the MT and the WTGenome-wide SNPs and InDels between the MT and the WT were identified by using SOAP on the basis of comparisons with the Clementine genome. In the MT and the WT, 3,237,862 and 3,422,013 SNPs were detected, respectively. Obviously, the number of detected SNPs in the latter comparison was more than that in the former because of the high fold coverage for the reference sequence. The SNP detected between two genomes and the reference genome was classified as transition (G/A and C/T) or transversion (A/C, C/G, G/T, and T/A) based on nucleotide substitution (Fig. 1A). Both of the transition proportions were significantly higher than the transversion proportions in two genotypes (Fig. 1A). Among these transitions, the G/A proportion was slightly more than that of C/T; among the transversions, the T/A proportion was the most and the G/C proportion was the least (Fig. 1A). The transition-to-transversion ratios were 1.468 and 1.475 in the MT and the WT, respectively. Annotation analysis of SNPs, InDels, and SVs.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The MT and the WT yielded 867,854 and 895,643 InDels (including insertion/deletion), respectively. Among these InDels, 412,922 (47.58%) and 426,266 (47.59%) were insertions in the MT and the WT in comparison with the reference sequence, respectively (Fig. 1B). The length of insertion ranged from 1 to 32 bp, whereas that of deletion was up to 46 bp between the MT and the reference (Fig. 1B). More than half of the InDels (52.10%) were mononucleotides, 14.74% were dinucleotides, 19.98% were 3- to 6-bp nucleotides, 6.78% were 7- to 10-bp nucleotides, and 6.40% were nucleotides >10 bp. Interestingly, the WT and the reference genome (Fig. 1B) showed the same trend. Meanwhile, 27,257 and 29,066 SVs were also found in the MT and the WT compared with the citrus reference genome, respectively. A comparative analysis showed that a total of 52,135 were identified between the MT and the WT; 4,188 were common and 47,947 were specific to the two genotypes. The types of SVs were deletion (75.86%), insertion (17.24%), translocation (5.38%), and inversion (1.52%) in the MT (Fig. 1C). In WT, the distribution trends were similar to those of MT. We also detected 16,487 SVs in two genotypes; 1,168 were present in both the MT and the WT, 7,600 were specific to the MT, and the other 7,719 were specific to the WT. The homozygous and heterozygous ratios were 4.12:1 for InDels and 2.22:1 for SVs in the MT, respectively. For the WT, the homozygous and heterozygous ratios were 4.00:1 and 2.12:1, respectively. The average densities of detected genetic variations between the two genotype genomes and the Clementine reference genome were 10,038.5 and 10,521.5 SNPs/Mb, 2,940.2 and 3,024.3 InDels/Mb, and 92.3 and 98.5 SVs/Mb in the MT and the WT, respectively.3.3. Analysis of genetic variation differences between the MT and the WTWe compared the SNPs between the MT and the WT based on Clementine reference genome, and the result showed that a total of 3,932,628 were identified between the MT and the WT, 2,727,248 were common and 1,117,089 were specific to the two genotypes at the genome level. To further evaluate the differential SNPs between the MT and the WT in the genic region, the data from the two genotypes were combined, and we obtained the following: a total of 1,897,842 SNPs located in the genic region; 1,589,456 were found in both the MT and the WT, 141,195 were specific to the MT distributed in 20,023 transcripts, and 167,182 were specific to the WT distributed in 21,684 transcripts. Among these genic SNPs, there were 1,422,343 homozygous and 475,499 hemizygous SNPs. The positions of specific SNP were identified in CDS, intron, 5' UTR, and 3' UTR regions according to the reference genome. Among 308,377 specific SNPs, 51,589 (MT: 23,169 and WT: 28,419) were located in UTR regions, 169,373 (MT: 76,885 and WT: 92,488) in intron regions, and 87,416 (MT: 41,141 and WT: 46,275) in CDS regions. Non-synonymous coding SNPs are believed to have the higher impact on phenotype.34 We therefore paid attention to specific non-synonymous SNPs in CDS regions in two genotypes. The number of non-synonymous SNPs was 25,769 (29.14%) and 29,018 (27.68%) in CDS regions of the MT and the WT, respectively. Such information will greatly enhance our understanding of the flowering process in the MT, as these are more likely to have phenotypic effects.A comparative analysis showed that a total of 1,293,383 InDels were identified between the MT and the WT; 649,514 were common and 397,741 were specific to the two genotypes. When increasing or decreasing nucleotides in a coding sequence, it's possible to produce a frameshift mutation followed by character variation.35 Therefore, the InDels of genic regions were also identified in this study. After being carefully filtered, 429,301 InDels were obtained in genic regions in the two genotypes; 267,756 were found in both the MT and the WT distributed in 23,488 transcripts, 63,119 were specific to the MT distributed in 10,092 transcripts, and 98,426 were specific to the WT distributed in 10,518 transcripts. Among 161,545 specific InDels, 37,720 (MT: 14,945 and WT: 22,775) were located in UTR regions, 114,118 (MT: 44,578 and WT: 69,540) in intron regions, and 9,707 (MT: 3,596 and WT: 6,111) in CDS regions. Interestingly, the number of specific genetic variations (including SNPs and InDels) from the MT is less than the MT in this study. Within the gene body, the maximum number of specific SNPs (MT: 54.45% and WT: 55.30%) and InDels (MT: 70.62% and WT: 70.65%) was present in the introns of two genotypes. Only a small part of specific SNPs (MT: 29.14% and WT: 27.68%) and InDels (MT: 5.69% and WT: 6.21%) occurred in the CDS region.3.4. Transcriptome analysis of flowering-related genetic variation in two genotypesTo reduce the identification of false-positive genetic variations at the transcriptional level, an integrative analysis of RNA-Seq and genome resequencing was performed for the two genotypes at the flowering transition stage (see Section 2.1). For the MT and the WT, 3.94 and 3.68 Gb of clean data were obtained, respectively. A total of 80.88% and 80.36% successful reads were perfectly matched to the Clementine genome for the MT and the WT, respectively. A summary of the resequencing data is presented in Supplementary Table S2. A total of 195,495 and 180,449 SNPs were identified in the MT and the WT distributed in 24,849 and 24,328 transcripts, respectively. Finally, a total of 233,998 SNPs were identified between the MT and the WT based on integrative analysis of RNA-Seq and genome resequencing. Of these, 53,549 were only present in the MT distributed in 20,366 transcripts, and 38,503 were only observed in the WT distributed in 18,388 transcripts (Fig. 2A). There were 202,222 homozygous SNPs and 95,986 synonymous SNPs among the total SNPs (Fig. 2B and C). We also found 333 SNPs that might lead to premature starting or stopping of transcription (220 starts gained and 113 stops gained), 7 SNPs related to intron splicing, and 22 mutations in start/stop codons (12 in start codons and 10 in stop codons) between the MT and the WT. Compared with the Clementine genome, 75,836 InDels were uncovered in the two genotypes; 18,264 were only present in the MT distributed in 10,996 transcripts, and 12,266 were only observed in the WT distributed in 8,164 transcripts (Fig. 2D). SNPs and InDels from transcriptional level distribution.

The remaining InDels are present in both genotypes. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.For the MT, annotation analysis showed that 47,130 SNPs and 20,791 InDels were located in the intron regions based on the annotation of the reference gene models during the phase change stage. Meanwhile, 40,416 SNPs and 19,011 InDels were also located in the intron regions in the WT. These results indicated that alternative splicing and novel transcriptional events may have occurred during the gene expression process of the two genotypes. In the MT and the WT, InDels with a length of 1 bp accounted for >50% of the whole genes. Most of the InDels in the coding sequence (CDS) regions were trinucleotides or hexanucleotides, which could not have been caused by frameshifts. However, mononucleotides were always the most common nucleotides in intergenic regions. Despite the minimally abundant distribution within critical sites, such as the CDS region and untranslated region (UTR) (12.1% of total InDels), these InDels can alter phenotypes through a variety of mechanisms.3.5. Identification of genetic variation in flowering-related genesA total of 244 transcripts representing putative homologs to flowering-related genes were identified in Clementine genome (http://www.phytozome.net/clementine.php) by BLAST searches against the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and NCBI data sets, and a total of 178 read-mapped flowering-related genes were observed in two genotypes in this study (Supplementary Table S2). Annotation analysis showed that 1,073 SNPs, 382 InDels, and 50 SVs were located in 147, 97, and 29 transcripts (including UTR, CDS region, and intron region) related to flower induction, flower development, and flowering time, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). These genetic variations may directly represent functional changes in the gene products. Some of these genes were required for the photoperiod pathway and some encode regulatory proteins specifically involved in the control of flowering by vernalization pathway, whereas others encoded components of ageing pathways or were involved in the circadian clock function (Supplementary Table S2). These included AGAMOUS, APETALA, and SEPALLATA genes for flower development; FRIGIDA, FRIGIDA INTERACTING PROTEIN1 gene, and VERNALIZATION3/5-like for the vernalization pathway; and SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein–like gene, GIGANTEA protein, and flowering-time control protein-related/FCA gamma-related for age and circadian clock developmental processes (Supplementary Table S2). Moreover, some additional flowering-time regulators containing genetic variations that have not been placed in any specific pathway were also identified, such as EMBRYONIC FLOWER1 (EMF1), RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6, FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR 1, and RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE IN FLOWERS 1 (Supplementary Table S2). We also found several genes encoding putative photoreceptor proteins, including phytochrome, phytochrome interacting factor, phytochrome and flowering-time regulatory protein, phytochrome-associated protein, and cryptochrome. These variations may provide important genetic variations to explain the phenotypic differences between the MT and the WT (Supplementary Table S2).3.6. Functional clustering and expression analysis of the transcripts containing specific InDels from the flowering phase change stageInDels that occur in functionally important regions of genes (typically CDS region) could be seen affecting gene function by frameshifts and structural changes of protein. Annotation analysis showed that the MT- and WT-specific InDels from the phase change stage were located in the CDS region of 1,137 and 721 transcripts, respectively. To explore and summarize the functional categories of these transcripts, we used Blast2GO to obtain the GO terms for the representation of molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. Approximately 902 (79.4%) and 588 (80.5%) of the MT and the WT transcripts had BLAST hits, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the transcript distribution for three main categories. Based on molecular function, these genes were finally classified into 12 categories; the three most over-represented GO terms were binding, hydrolase activity, and transporter activity (Fig. 3A). Categories based on biological processes revealed that the mutant genes were related to 14 biological processes (Fig. 3B); the three most frequent terms were metabolic process, cellular process, and single-organism process, suggesting that these mutative genes were involved in a broad range of physiological functions (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C in cellular component category, the analysis revealed a high percentage of cells and organelles in cellular components. The biological interpretation of these transcripts was further examined using KEGG pathway analysis. In the MT and the WT, 84 and 71 different pathways were found, respectively. Those pathways mainly correlated with development involved with metabolism, hormone signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation, suggesting that some mutative genes may affect the distinguishing traits of the MT and the WT. Functional categorization of the transcripts containing InDels. These genes were categorized based on GO annotation, and the proportion of each category is displayed based on (A) cellular component, (B) molecular function, or (C) biological process.

These genes were categorized based on GO annotation, and the proportion of each category is displayed based on (A) cellular component, (B) molecular function, or (C) biological process. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Using all of our sequence reads, the expression levels of 1,858 transcripts containing specific InDels were estimated during the phase change stage. There were 131 transcripts that were differently expressed between the MT and the WT, with P = 0.005 and the absolute value of |log2 ratio| = 0.5 used as the threshold. Of these, 97 were more abundant and 34 were less abundant in the MT compared with the WT, suggesting that many genes were enriched during the flowering transition (Supplementary Table S4). BLAST searches of the 131 transcripts showed that 102 transcripts (77.9%) were homologous to known genes, 9 transcripts (6.9%) were homologous to genes of unknown function, and 20 clones (15.3%) had no matches in the database. Among 102 homologous to known genes, many had high identity with known transcription and post-transcriptional regulatory genes, indicating that these genes may be key regulators controlling flower development by activating or repressing numerous genes. Moreover, some transcription factors, including MYB, MADS, and Zinc finger, were observed (Supplementary Table S3). In addition to transcription factors, differently expressed genes involving chromatin remodeling, hormone regulation, and other metabolic pathways were also observed.3.7. Development of new DNA markers in citrusTo test cross-species/genera transferability, 268 newly identified InDel markers were tested on a panel of 32 diverse citrus accessions (Fig. 4). Of these primer pairs, 35 primer pairs cannot amplify any fragment, suggesting that these primers were not well designed; 72 pairs of primers amplify numerous non-target bands, suggesting that these primers were also problematic; and 87 pairs of primers did not exhibit any difference. Only 74 InDels were confirmed. The results indicated that a high level of genetic diversity in the vicinity of these InDels was discovered in 32 genotypes. The number of alleles per locus ranges from 2 to 10, with an average of 3.92 alleles. Ne ranges from 1.06 to 7.04, with an average of 2.34. Ho ranges from 0.0 to 0.97, with an average of 0.34. He ranges from 0.06 to 0.87, with an average of 0.51. PIC ranged from 0.06 for the Ciclev10029752m locus to 0.48 for the Ciclev10010584m locus (Supplementary Table S5). The mean PIC value for citrus genera was 0.45 (range, 0.40–0.47), which was higher than 0.43 and 0.44 observed for trifoliate orange genera (range, 0.43–0.48) and fortunella genera, respectively (Table 1). The aforementioned InDel allelic data, when used to calculate the heterozygosity estimates, revealed highly significant differences between the observed and expected heterozygosity for citrus (mean Ho: 0.35; mean He: 0.43) and fortunella genera (mean Ho: 0.22; mean He: 0.23). Thus, the results suggest significant heterozygote deficiency among the three genera of Rutaceae (Supplementary Table S4). In addition, it is noteworthy that some band patterns from the above markers were almost the same between the MT and flying dragon trifoliate orange (Fig. 4). However, precocious trifoliate orange cannot be derived from flying dragon trifoliate orange based on their huge morphological differences and previous studies.10,12,13 There might be one possible explanation. Because precocious trifoliate orange and its WT have nearly the same morphology other than flowering regulation, these InDel markers from the MT and the WT may be related to flowering. Furthermore, flying dragon trifoliate orange shows a certain degree of early flowering compared with the mutant's WT.

Genetic diversity and dendrogram in citrus genus by new DNA markersDespite a relatively low level of polymorphism, the 74 new markers from InDels were also examined for their potential use in genetic diversity analysis among 32 citrus species (Fig. 5). The UPGMA phylogenetic tree revealed three major clusters including 4, 3, and 25 genotypes in each cluster (trifoliate orange, fortunella, and citrus, respectively). The UPGMA-based clustering showed the grouping of all 4 species (including the MT and the WT) of trifoliate orange in one group (trifoliate orange cluster), 3 species of fortunella, kumquat, and calamondin in one group (fortunella cluster), and 25 species in one group (citrus cluster). Traditionally, calamondin should be clustered citrus cluster. There might be two possible explanations: at first, calamondin with a short juvenile of 1–2 yr and flowered twice or three times per year similar to precocious trifoliate orange. Second, these new InDel markers may be related to flowering. In the citrus cluster, citrus limon, citrus medica, citrus grandis, and sweet orange formed one subcluster and were more closely related than the other subclusters of citrus. Nei's genetic distance values ranged from 0 (C. sinesis Newhall, Jingcheng, Cara Cara, Washington, and blood orange) to 0.41 (P. trifoliata Raf. × C. sinensis vs. C. grandis Kaopan), with an average value of 0.25 ± 0.07 (Fig. 5).

DiscussionTo understand genetic variation involved in flowering development in citrus, we used genome resequencing technology to analyse the genetic variations between precocious trifoliate orange and its WT. Between the MT and the WT, 3,932,628 SNPs, 1,293,383 InDels, and 52,135 SVs were identified. In previous studies, precocious trifoliate orange is speculated to be a direct variant of the WT.10,12,13 Such a large amount of genetic variation is found owing to the following reasons. For example, naturally occurring mutants are extensively found under the influence of environmental factors in woody perennials and humanity36; it was reported that there was many genetic variation in different tissues of the human body such as liver and lung.37,38 On the other hand, the trifoliate orange produces polyembryonic seeds containing both sexual and apomictic embryos. About 10–20% of seedlings from open-pollinated trifoliate orange seeds develop from zygotic embryos; some genetic variations may be generated. Therefore, the genetic variations gradually increase from generation to generation.39 In this study, >20% of the SNPs were heterozygous in two trifoliate oranges. Further supporting the observation that the InDels was also highly heterozygous, approximately 31.07 and 32.04% of the InDels were heterozygous in the MT and the WT, respectively. This observation suggested a notably high heterozygosity rate in the trifoliate orange genera. High levels of heterozygosity introduce additional challenges for the identification of various kinds of DNA polymorphisms, especially complex SVs.37 Heterozygosity decreases the proportion of reads mapping to a unique genomic location in a manner dependent on the degree of heterozygosity, so only 61.73 and 63.13% of clean reads were uniquely mapped to the citrus reference genome. In previous studies, heterozygosity has been a common feature in most eukaryotic organisms and has shown important biological functions in woody plants.40,41 Although citrus is generally perceived to have highly heterozygous traits,14 the amount of heterozygosity in the whole genome is not clear. The results presented in this study further characterize the extent of genome heterozygosity and its functional effects at both the whole genome and the global transcriptome levels for two trifoliate oranges.Knowing genomic positions of genetic variations in genetic markers is important.42 Many population genetic and genetic mapping applications rely on unlinked markers. In this study, these genetic variations showed only minimal distribution in CDS regions, consistent with the results of SNP in tomato.43 This might be related to the increased size of the intron in citrus. Interestingly, there were more SNPs than InDels and SVs in the CDS regions. This difference can be explained by the fact that InDels and SVs are more deleterious than SNPs in the CDS regions, as indicated by InDels and SVs that cause frameshift mutations and amino acid substitutions that cause major changes in gene function.44,45 However, SNPs often produce synonymous mutations that have little or no impact on gene expression and function.46 In this study, 16,919 MT-specific and 12,513 WT-specific SNPs predicted to cause non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were identified at the transcriptional level based on integrative analysis. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions was 2.22 and 2.19 in the WT and the MT, respectively. These SNPs may represent causal genetic variation contributing to phenotype variation in the MT and the WT. Without additional experimental evidence, we cannot yet say whether these SNPs affect the regulation of flowering-related genes or have another direct effect on mutant phenotypes. Nevertheless, using this SNP set to perform genome-wide association in two genotype genomes would be more efficient than using a general SNP set to identify causal gene mutations.Combining genome and transcriptome profiling data has been used as a powerful approach for the identification of functional genetic variations and candidate genes for traits of interest.47 To investigate the candidate genetic variation responsible for early flowering, we integrated the RNA-Seq and genome resequencing of genetic variation data. A total of 362 large-effect SNPs were found between the MT and the WT and were found to affect the integrity of encoded proteins. These large-effect SNPs included disruption of splice sites, loss of translation initiation codon, introduction of premature stop codon, and loss of stop codon. Likewise, we identified 1,137 and 721 specific InDels in the CDS region of the MT and the WT, respectively, during the phase stage, which may cause frameshift, disruption of splice sites, or introduction of premature stop codon in the two genotypes of trifoliate orange. The significant proportion of genes containing large-effect SNPs and InDels suggested that these genes may represent differences in gene sequences between the MT and the WT. GO analysis indicated that these genes predicted to contain specific InDels were more commonly associated with binding than with other functionality in this study. This may suggest that proteins with the function of binding may play a significant role in the early flowering process of the MT. In addition, the significantly differentially expressed genes contain specific InDels (Supplementary Table S3) that can be directly linked to trifoliate orange flowering transition. Many known transcription factors related to flowering regulation were also differentially expressed, including MADS-box, ring zinc finger, MYB, and GRAS (Supplementary Table S3). The transcript levels of these transcription factors were higher during the phase stage when floral buds began flowering compared with the WT, suggesting that its main role was associated with flowering time in the MT. These differentially expressed genes covered a broad range of genes related to flowering regulation, providing helpful information for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying the signalling and regulation of the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase.However, structural alterations of genes are generally believed to modify their function and expression. We found that at least 2,288 and 2,260 specific SVs showed changes in the CDS region of the MT and the WT, respectively. Although further studies are required to identify the specific gene(s) responsible for the early flowering trait, the genes could be interesting candidates for investigation in further studies. In addition, we determined whether the genes related to the flowering pathway controlling flowering time were significantly altered in the MT genome. Annotation analysis showed that 1,073 SNPs, 382 InDels, and 50 SVs were located in 272 flowering-related transcripts, respectively. This finding might suggest that the early flowering of the MT was correlated to genetic variations of these flowering pathway genes. An alternative hypothesis is that the phenotype was caused by the changes in the function of the genes through protein structure alterations. Differences in the expression patterns of flowering pathway genes were observed in the MT compared with the WT, and this might support this hypothesis. Although the exact function of these mutated genes, especially with respect to flowering, was not determined, these genes might be interesting candidates for further studies.Recently, a large number of InDels, SNPs, and SVs have been generated using the genome resequencing platform in citrus.9,40,41 These genetic variation markers may be assayed using the same separation and detection technologies as simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In fact, some InDels may be caused by SSRs. Citrus trifoliata (representing P. trifoliata) has consistently been one of the most important rootstock species used in the citrus industry, and it has even been used as a model species for citrus molecular biology and genomic studies. These new InDel markers are specific to trifoliate orange. Therefore, they will play important roles in marker-assisted selection and citrus breeding. In addition, these markers may be related to the flowering they ascribed to their high distribution, and whole-genome polymorphisms have been applied to high-resolution genetic mapping and map-based cloning in flowering genes.48,49 However, the usefulness of genetic variation has not been explored in genetic and genomic research for citrus. To verify that these genetic variations were suitable for use as new DNA markers, they were used to successfully design PCR primers. In this study, we selected 268 InDels to develop PCR-based markers, of which 74 (26.7%) were polymorphic either between the two resequenced trifoliate orange or among 30 accessions from different subspecies of citrus, indicating that the bioinformatics tools were inadequate for detecting InDels in the trifoliate orange genome. However, the genetic variation will be useful to select candidate genetic variation that could be associated with unique phenotypes or agronomical traits in citrus. Furthermore, our collection of genetic variations that differentiate the MT from the WT can be used to guide the search for pure trifoliate orange types (or to recognize other cryptic species) among the hundreds of known cultivars and other germplasm accessions. More importantly, because the coordinates of these loci are known in relation to a reference genome, it is possible to develop genetic markers within specific genome regions to assist in efficient construction of genetic maps in the future.FundingThis research was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31130046, 31471863, 31372046, 31221062, and 31101528), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2013PY083), and the International Foundation for Science (C/5148-2).

IntroductionSmall RNAs (sRNAs), which are derived from double-stranded RNA or hairpin-structured RNA, are non-coding RNAs of 19–30 nt in length.1 Over the last decade, several key studies have demonstrated that sRNAs participate in various cellular processes in many organisms, including DNA damage response, the maintenance of genome integrity, and the regulation of developmental processes.2–4 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of three major classes of sRNAs.4,5 And they are commonly 22 nt in length and play important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plants and animals.2 Mature miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression via complementary binding to the open reading frame or untranslated region (UTR) of specific target genes. The sRNA pathway has been characterized in several filamentous fungi,6,7 but the miRNA pathway remains poorly understood in most fungal species. Recently, it was reported that at least four types of miRNAs have been identified in Neurospora crassa,3 including a Dicer-dependent miRNA pathway. The production of these miRNA-like small RNAs (milRNAs) does not require quelling deficient-1 (QDE-1, a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) or QDE-3 (a RecQ DNA helicase) but is dependent on Dicer, QDE-2 (an Argonaute protein), the exonuclease QDE-2 interacting protein, and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L3 (a RNase III domain-containing protein). These differences may indicate that fungal miRNA production evolved independently from that in plants and animals. Recently, deep sequencing technology was applied to investigate milRNA in nine filamentous fungi.8–16 However, neither miRNA nor milRNA has been reported in the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, raising the question of whether miRNAs exist in R. solani.Rhizoctonia solani, a basidiomycete necrotrophic fungal pathogen, is widely distributed and causes the loss of many economically important plants.17 In addition to rice, the fungus can infect the crops of approximately 50 species, including maize, barley, lettuce, sorghum, and tomato.18–20 As the agent of rice sheath blight disease, R. solani anastomosis group AG1 IA infection results in the most serious economic agricultural losses. Currently, studies of R. solani AG1 IA group classification,17 infection process,21 transcriptome, and genome22 have been reported; however, studies describing the milRNA of R. solani AG1 IA are lacking. Given its economic importance, we examined the regulatory role of miRNAs in host–pathogen interactions. We applied Illumina sequencing to investigate milRNA over six phases of R. solani infection process in rice. The main objective of our study is to explore the potential of miRNAs as pathogenetic factors and to elucidate the possible molecular basis of the host–pathogen interactions of the rice-infecting pathogen to improve the yield of food crops. In addition, R. solani AG1 IA milRNA was also the first miRNA reported in the Rhizoctonia genus, and it may serve as a model for studying pathogenic mechanisms.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics statementThe human cell lines provided by Shanghai Ying Biotechnology Co., Ltd, were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Protocols in this study were approved by the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All experiments were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines.2.2. Fungal strainsThe R. solani AG1 IA strain was selected from a heavily infected rice plant at South China Agricultural University and was designated the national standard isolate. The fungal strains were germinated and mycelia cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA; 200 g of potato, 20 g of dextrose, and 20 g of agar) at 28 °C for 2 days. The mycelia were used for infection and RNA extraction.2.3. RNA extraction and construction of cDNA librariesTo detect the interactions of rice and R. solani AG1, we collected strains at seven infection stages. The seven stages included mycelium cultured on PDA without plant; mycelium incubated on rice for 10-h; infection cushion incubated on rice for 18-h; after mycelium had invaded the host, with light necrosis appearing after 24-h; heavy necrosis after a 32-h incubation; heavy necrosis after a 48-h incubation and light grey sclerotia on infected plant tissue after a 72-h incubation. We extracted total RNA from these samples using a Fungal RNA Kit (Omega, USA). Next, cDNA libraries were constructed using a TransScript First-Stand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (TransGen, Beijing, China). sRNA was then extracted using a mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, USA), and small cDNA libraries were constructed using a One Step PrimerScript miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (TransGen).2.4. Cloning and sequencing of R. solani AG1 sRNAsFractions of sRNA between 15 and 30 nt were extracted from the seven-staged samples on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Next, a 5' adaptor and a 3' adaptor were ligated sequentially to 15 µg of sRNA. Then, the short RNAs were converted to DNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequenced on an Illumina GA II machine (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The sequenced short read data were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the accession number GSE68236.2.5. Identification of miRNAsAfter removing adaptor contaminants and low-quality tags from the raw reads, the remaining sRNA sequences were utilized in further analysis. We compared sRNAs against known non-coding RNAs (i.e. rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA) deposited in the Rfam database23 (version: 10.1) to identify other ncRNAs using BLAST (version 2.2.26). sRNAs belonging to the ‘rRNA, etc.’ class were removed. The prediction of R. solani AG1 IA milRNAs was performed using MIREAP (version 0.2; http://sourceforge.net/projects/mireap) and miRDeep2 software. Both methods identified known miRNAs and novel candidates with a canonical hairpin structure. Some changes in the published workflow were adopted to predict milRNAs. Tags that appeared in at least four libraries were selected. The abundance of each tag in each library was normalized to transcripts per million (TPM), and tags with an abundance >2.5 TPM were used to identify candidate milRNAs. Based on the normalized data, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between milRNAs and performed hierarchical cluster analysis using the hclust function in R based on the average agglomeration method, which was used to analyse the expression pattern of the milRNAs. These candidate milRNAs were also aligned to the R. solani AG1 IA genome sequence (accession AFRT00000000.1).242.6. Target gene predictionMiranda v3.3a25 software was used to predict targets of candidate milRNAs with the following parameters: gap open penalty (-8), a gap extend penalty (-2), score threshold (90), energy threshold (-23) kcal/mol, and scaling parameter (2).2.7. Identification of rice miRNA and their target genesDuring the milRNA prediction as shown above, we had obtained the clean reads without other ncRNAs. These reads were aligned to the hairpin sequences of rice miRNAs in the miRBase database26 using BLASTN. Then, we analysed the reads that were perfectly matched to rice miRNA sequences. And reads in at least three libraries (10-h, 18-h, 24-h, 32-h, 48-h, and 72-h) at more than 2.5 TPM were considered as rice miRNA sequence. We further confirmed that all these reads were not matched to R. solani AG1 IA genome sequences by performing BLASTN alignment. As several miRNA sequences in miRBase were actually the same to each other (such as the same sequences found for osa-miR159a.1 and osa-miR159b), they were considered as one miRNA here. Finally, 23 rice miRNAs were discovered. The target genes of these miRNAs had been reported in the miRBase database and one study by Zhu et al.,27 and these resources were used for analysis in our study.2.8. TranscriptomeThe R. solani AG1 IA transcriptome was detailed in our previous study.22,24 Six transcriptome libraries for plant infection at 10-, 18-, 24-, 32-, 48-, and 72-h were prepared and sequenced. The expected fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments (FPKM) values were calculated. The FPKM values of milRNA targets were used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and to perform hierarchical cluster analysis (the hclust function in R).2.9. Construction of the protein-protein interaction networkThe protein–protein interactions (PPIs) were obtained in our previous study28 that identify interactions based on the interolog approach and domain–domain interactions and assess the interactions by gene expression profile, gene ontology (GO) annotation, and the results of yeast two-hybrid assay.2.10. Analysis of miRNA expression using RT-qPCRExperimental validation of miRNA-like RNAs was performed using the miRNA Purification Kit (Cwbio, CW0627), miRNA cDNA Kit (Cwbio, CW2141), and miRNA Real-Time PCR Assay Kit (Cwbio, CW2142). Briefly, a poly-A tail was added to the 3' end of total RNA. Then, the RNA was reverse-transcribed with an oligo-dT adaptor. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was then performed using Synergy Brands green detection with a forward primer for mature milRNA sequences and a universal adaptor reverse primer.29 To calculate the expression levels of the target gene, the 2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>CT relative quantification method was employed.30 All reactions were repeated three times with three biological samples and were detected by 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis.2.11. Dual-luciferase reporter assayThis assay system was provided by Shanghai Ying Biotechnology Co., Ltd. We used the psiCHECK-2 dual-luciferase reporter vector, which contained both the synthetic Renilla luciferase gene and the synthetic firefly luciferase gene, each with its own promoter and poly (A)-addition sites.31 The target gene of Rhi-milR-16 was synthesized using XhoI and NotI sites at 5' and 3' ends, respectively, and was inserted between the XhoI and NotI restriction sites in the multiple cloning regions of the Renilla Luciferase 3'-UTR. As a negative control, we designed the following mutated Rhi-milR-16 targeting oligonucleotide: 5'-CGCTAGTTCAGAGTGGACGGTCT-3'. For luciferase assays, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of the reporter plasmid (psiCHECK2-AG1IA_02173) and 100 nm of the mimic. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega).3. Results3.1. Identification of milRNAs in infection stagesTo identify milRNAs in R. solani AG1 IA, we analysed sequencing data collected pre-infection and at six different stages of infection, including 10 h (10-h), 18-h, 24-h, 32-h, 48-h, and 72-h after infection. A total of 77,029,030 clean reads were sequenced. For each library, greater than 1 million unique reads were obtained, at least 67% of which were singletons (Table 1). The lengths of all sequenced sRNAs range from 18 to 30 nt, with the majority distribution on 19–25 nt (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is similar to the standard distribution of sRNAs in plants and animals.2 The composition of the deep sequenced sRNA dataset is very complex and includes a large number of other non-coding RNA species, such as rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA (Supplementary Table S1). Given this complexity and the disproportionate number of singletons in our data that possibly originate from sequencing error, we utilized a method (Fig. 1) originally developed for fungal milRNA prediction with some alterations to the rice miRNA detection workflow.32 In our analysis, reads matched to other non-coding RNA types were removed, and the R. solani AG1 IA genome sequence22 was used as the reference for milRNA detection. Previous research on fungal milRNA detection has indicated that few milRNAs are conserved compared with other eukaryotes.8–15. Two popular and powerful tools, MIREAP and miRDeep2,33,34 can identify fungal milRNAs; however, fewer than 45 miRNAs were found for each of four reported fungi,8,9,13,15 which may be due to the limitation of analytical workflows. However, each method also has its limits of prediction in fungi. Here, we used both MIREAP and miRDeep2 to comprehensively analyse our sequencing data, avoiding their shortages, and identified a total of 177 candidate milRNAs, each identified in at least four libraries at more than 2.5 TPM (Supplementary Table S2). Each of the 177 candidate milRNAs, of which 17 milRNAs were overlapped predicted by MIREAP and miRDeep2, was supported by at least 11 reads in one of the libraries (Supplementary Table S2). Three milRNAs were chosen as examples and are presented in Supplementary Figs S2 and S3.

Conserved and novel milRNAsA comparison of sequences between candidate milRNAs in R. solani AG1 IA and published miRNAs in miRBase,26 detailing milRNAs in other fungi,8–15 revealed that 109 milRNAs exhibited partial sequence conservation (sequence coverage > 50%, identity = 0.88) (Supplementary Table S3). Fourteen milRNAs in R. solani AG1 IA matched 14 miRNA mature sequences belonging to 14 families in miRBase with alignment coverage greater than 70% (greater for Rhi-milR-94; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Among the remaining 95 semi-conserved milRNAs, 24 (25.26%) had expression greater than 10 TPM during the infection stages. In addition, 68 novel milRNAs were not conserved among fungi and were exclusively found in R. solani AG1 IA. At least 15 novel milRNAs exhibited expression levels greater than 20 TPM during the infection stages, suggesting their involvement in the pathogenic mechanism of Rhizoctonia. Further study of these milRNAs is needed to improve the understanding of their involvement in the pathogenesis of filamentous fungi.3.3. Target prediction of milRNAsBased on the genome sequence of R. solani AG1 IA,22 the 3'-UTRs of 653 genes were predicted to be target regions for 157 milRNAs using Miranda25 (Supplementary Table S5). Targets were not identified for 20 milRNAs, which could be explained by several reasons: they may lack a target, their target may not be annotated in the genome, there may be mismatches between genome and milRNA35 or their targets may be outside of the 3'-UTR.36Pleiotropic miRNA may target several mRNAs in a given signalling pathway or different mRNAs in converging pathways to exert a large effect on a cell.37 Many of the milRNAs examined in this work regulated multiple mRNA targets. In fact, only 30 (19.11%) milRNAs regulated a single target (Supplementary Table S5). The largest number of targets that we identified for one milRNA (Rhi-milR-135) is 50. Fifteen milRNAs had more than 10 targets, and 103 genes were predicted to be regulated by at least two milRNAs (Supplementary Table S5). Of the 653 targeted genes, 342 (52.37%) have been annotated,22 including transcription factors (TFs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs), haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase, ABC transporters, cytochrome P450, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, heterotrimeric G proteins, and mitotic checkpoint proteins (Supplementary Table S6). Among them, some of the predicted target factors could be involved in pathogenicity, including cell wall-degrading enzymes and virulence-associated factors in the transduction signal pathway in the Pathogen–Host Interaction (PHI) database.38 Target genes with possible functions in pathogenesis were discovered using GO terms and the EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, which included pathogenic-related GO classifications (such as hydrolase activity annotated in GH10), large numbers of signal transduction genes, and genes involved in secretion (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8; Supplementary Fig. S4). During infection stages, secreted proteins are typically important factors, which may indicate their involvement in pathogenesis. For example, the expression of AG1IA_00621 (a putative secreted protein) was up-regulated during the infection stages from 10-h to 32-h, while the expression of its milRNA regulator Rhi-milR-91 decreased during these stages (Supplementary Tables S2 and S6).3.4. Pathogenic protein-protein network regulationThe PPI network of R. solani AG1 IA28 contains the interacting partners of 120 milRNA targets, including 14 PHI genes and 6 secreted proteins (Supplementary Table S9). Among them, some of the genes involved in the cell cycle are contained in one subnetwork (Supplementary Fig. S5), including AG1IA_05392 (a mitotic checkpoint protein), AG1IA_06586 (a g2/mitotic-specific cyclin), AG1IA_03893 (a cell division regulator), AG1IA_00552 (a cyclin-dependent kinase regulatory subunit), and AG1IA_08213 (an exocyst complex protein). AG1IA_08213 regulated by Rhi-milR-48 is involved in the exocyst complex, which plays roles in exocytosis, cell migration, and growth.39 The network interaction between AG1IA_08213 and AG1IA_05392 is regulated by Rhi-milR-115, supporting that AG1IA_08213 is involved in the cell cycle. Two PHI genes—AG1IA_03893 (cell division control) that showed a peak in transcript level at 10-h stage and AG1IA_06586 (a g2/mitotic specific cyclin) that was abundantly expressed during infection process, regulated by Rhi-milR-95 and Rhi-milR-85, respectively—interact with one another, possibly indicating an important role for milRNAs in pathogenesis. In one subnetwork, an ABC-A transporter (AG1IA_05406) interacts with AG1IA_03552 (peptidase), which is subsequently regulated by Rhi-milR-75. Because the AG1IA_05406 homologue (MGG_00937) in Magnaporthe oryzae is essential for formation of the appressoria, a specialized cell of fungal pathogens that is used to infect plants,40 it is possible that AG1IA_05406 plays a similar role in R. solani AG1 IA. This notion is also supported by its expression pattern, which peaks 24-h after infection.22 However, to confirm the function of this gene, further experimental approaches are needed.AG1IA_05961 is a candidate G protein beta subunit (Gß), which is an important basic unit of the heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signalling pathway. Heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signalling plays a central role in the virulence, mycelial growth, and development of <U+FB01>lamentous fungi.41 In a yeast two-hybrid assay, we explored the protein interactions of a hub (i.e. connected proteins with central roles in network architecture) containing AG1IA_05961 and its nine partners.28 We identified three key milRNA regulators of this hub (Rhi-milR-44, Rhi-milR-120, and Rhi-milR-77) in the transduction signal pathway (Supplementary Fig. S6).In the ubiquitin ligase (AG1IA_01341) hub, 13 partners, including transporters, actin, ubiquitin, and uncharacterized proteins, were predicted as PPIs. This ubiquitin ligase was predicted to be a potential effector of R. solani AG1 IA during infection stages,22 and Rhi-milR-83 might regulate a key factor in this subnetwork, supporting by more than 2-fold up-regulation of Rhi-milR-83 during 0-h and 18-h stages and the decreased transcription of AG1IA_01341 during infection. In total, functional annotation of milRNA target mRNAs reveals that milRNAs have complex interactions in PPI networks involved in pathogenesis, transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle regulation.3.5. milRNA expression patterns during rice infectionBased on the normalized expression of milRNAs during infection stages, hierarchical clustering (see Materials and methods section) identifies eight major clusters (Fig. 2A). In clade A, expression peaks appear without fungal infection (0-h), and expression declines during the 10-h and 18-h stages. In clades B and C, milRNAs exhibit increased expression at the 10-h and 18-h stages. For clades D, milRNAs display exaggerated expression peaks at 24-h. Different expression patterns are found for milRNAs in clade H, which exhibits increased expression from 10-h to 24-h. milRNAs were found to target 631 genes expressed during infection stages in a previous study22 (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S7). Different expression patterns for target genes are noted for most targets in clades M, O, and P, which exhibit the highest expression at 32-h, 10-h, and 24-h, respectively (Fig. 2B). Five TFs were clustered into clades J and O, including two fungal-specific TFs (AG1IA_05790 and AG1IA_03810) that display expression peaks at the 18-h stage and one bZIP TF (AG1IA_03425) that displays an expression peak at the 10-h stage. AG1IA_05790 is predicted to be regulated by Rhi-milR-54, Rhi-milR-145, and Rhi-milR-163. In contrast, AG1IA_03810 is regulated by Rhi-milR-16. The peak expression of these genes suggests their involvement in regulating other infection-related genes. One secreted protein (AG1IA_00123, GH9) in clade J is regulated by Rhi-milR-165 and is up-regulated at least 2-fold during 10-h and 18-h stages. The expression peak at 18-h for this GH9 enzyme might help to identify its potential role of cellulose digestion. The fungal ABC transporter G family members are connected to pleiotropic drug resistance phenomena and are related to translocation of phospholipid molecules.42–44 During the infection by R. solani, the rice antimicrobials (such as secondary metabolites and small molecules) can be activated and accumulated in response to the pathogen.45 To facilitate the rice infection, R. solani ABC-G transporters may be contributed to drug resistance. One ABC-G transporter (AG1IA_02225; in clade O) shows the abundance of expression, especially for the peak occurred at 10-h (Supplementary Fig. S7), indicating its important role in pathogenesis, which may also be supported by the down-regulated expression of its putative regulator Rhi-milR-57 during 0-h and 10-h stages. In clade M, the expression of GH6 (AG1IA_08328), which is regulated by Rhi-milR-144, is at its highest during the 32-h stage. Previous research reported that biotrophic fungi lack the cellulose of GH6 and hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi employ it to degrade plant cell wall.46–49 AG1IA_08328 was found to use plant cell walls as a substrate22, suggesting its involvement in the infection process and an important role for Rhi-milR-144. AG1IA_05961 is regulated by Rhi-milR-120 and Rhi-milR-145, and an interacting protein (AG1IA_04857, phosphoglucomutase) is regulated by Rhi-milR-77 (Supplementary Fig. S6A), which may facilitate a greater understanding of the heterotrimeric G protein-mediated signalling pathway in R. solani.milRNA may regulate multiple targets that exhibit different expression patterns, whereas milRNAs with similar expression patterns may regulate different expressed targets. Rhi-milR-16 is predicted to specifically regulate six mRNAs that are regulated by Rhi-milR-16 alone (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S5). Among these targets, AG1IA_01440 (hypothetical protein) is not expressed during infection, whereas the others differentiate into five different clusters containing AG1IA_02173 (dynactin), AG1IA_03810 (fungal-specific TF), AG1IA_04392 (dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase), AG1IA_05100 (CE10), and AG1IA_07163 (hypothetical protein) in clades P, J, N, K, and O, respectively. The transcriptome expression patterns of these genes in the five clades are distinct. The different expression patterns of the targets of the three milRNAs (Rhi-milR-92, Rhi-milR-94, and Rhi-milR-151) selected for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmation also yielded similar results (Figs 2 and 3A). To investigate the expression patterns of target genes for the milRNAs forming one cluster, targets regulated by four milRNA clusters were selected for analysis and the diversity of expression patterns were represented (Supplementary Fig. S8), supporting that miRNA-dependent regulatory network is very complex.50 However, considering the peak and valley points of expression for target mRNAs, the milRNA expressions seemed to be correlated with the transcript levels of their possible target genes during early infection stages (Supplementary Fig. S8E), such as: occurrence of 0-h peaks for milRNAs in cluster A and 10-h peaks for targets; 10-h and 18-h peaks for milRNAs in cluster B, and 24-h peaks and 10-h valleys for targets; 10-h and 18-h peaks for milRNA in cluster C, and 24-h peaks and 18-h valleys for targets.

Confirmation of milRNA differential expression during infectionThe purpose of this study was to explore the role of milRNAs involved in host–pathogen interactions. During the process of rice infection, the 10-h and 18-h stages are crucial for successful infection by R. solani AG1 IA. Mycelium rapidly develops on the rice surface at 10-h, and infection cushions form at 18-h after infection. We analysed milRNA expression in the initial three samples (0-h, 10-h, and 18-h) by RT-qPCR and found that the expression of randomly selected milRNAs (Rhi-milR-92, Rhi-milR-94, and Rhi-milR-151) declined at 0–10 and 0–18 h stages, suggesting up-regulated of their targets during the key infection stages (Fig. 3A). The Rhi-milR-92 target gene AG1IA_09584 (hydrolase domain-containing protein) was particularly abundant at 10-h and 18-h. After the pathogen infection, special antimicrobials will be produced by rice in response to the pathogen.45 The expression peak at 10-h for AG1IA_09584 that encodes a member of haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase superfamily may indicate its involvement in pathogenic progress by degrading the antimicrobial compounds from rice. The trend in milRNA expression level in the initial three samples was similar to that of the normalized tags (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S2). RT-PCR results confirm that these three milRNAs exist in R. solani AG1 IA (Fig. 3B).3.7. Validation of Rhi-milR-16 targetsThe interactions between a miRNA and its targeted mRNA site(s) are important for understanding miRNA function. The predicted target of Rhi-milR-16 is AG1IA_02173 (Fig. 4A and B). To test the Rhi-milR-16 mimic and its target gene interactions, an exogenous dual-luciferase reporter assay was utilized. HEK293T cells co-transfected with a reporter plasmid (psiCHECK2-AG1IA_02173) and the Rhi-milR-16 mimic decreased the luciferase expression ratio relative to cells transfected with only the psiCHECK-2_AG1IA_02173 reporter. However, the negative control, which contained a mutated Rhi-milR-16 targeting site reporter (psiCHECK2-AG1IA_02173-mut) co-transfected with Rhi-milR-16 mimic (Supplementary Table S10), exhibited the same luciferase expression ratio relative to cells transfected exclusively with the psiCHECK-2_AG1IA_02173-mut reporter (Supplementary Table S11). These results indicate that the Rhi-milR-16 mimic for the psiAG1IA_02173 reporter was inhibitory (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Table S12), but the Rhi-milR-16 mimic for the psiAG1IA_02173-mut reporter was not (P > 0.05) (Supplementary Table S12). Therefore, Rhi-milR-16 appears to regulate the predicted target gene AG1IA_02173 (dynactin). Dynactin, an additional multisubunit complex, is required for efficient dynein-mediated transport of vesicles in vitro;51 plays an important role in early endosome motility and apical recycling, which is involved in hyphal tip growth and pathogenicity;52 and results in abnormal hyphal growth and defective in nuclear distribution when mutated.53 This finding suggests that milRNA is associated with the exocytosis, infection, and growth of R. solani AG1 IA.

Rice miRNAs and their target genesDuring the infection, the complex plant defence responses to the broad host-range necrotrophs will be initiated, which may contrast and share mechanisms with biotrophs and is significant to dissect the host–pathogen interactions.54 In rice, several miRNAs are discovered to involve in plant immunity against the hemibiotroph M. oryzae.55 However, no rice miRNA is reported to induce responses to the necrotoph R. solani AG1 IA. We further investigated the sequencing sRNA data and identified 23 rice miRNAs in at least three libraries at more than 2.5 TPM (Supplementary Table S13; Supplementary Fig. S9). Among these miRNAs, two miRNAs (osa-miR164a/b/f and osa-miR166k/l-3p) previously indicated to involve in rice immunity against M. oryzae55 were also identified, and four miRNAs (osa-miR164e, osa-miR396f-5p, osa-miR530-5p, and osa-miR6253) without expression in rice response to M. oryzae (Supplementary Data in study by Li, et al.55) were found in this study, suggesting the multifaceted host resistance mechanisms in rice. For the 59 target genes of these miRNAs, at least of 43 (72.88%) were TFs (such as MYB TFs; Supplementary Table S14) that may regulate responses to necrotrophs. Members of MYB TFs had been reported to mediate responses to necrotrophic fungi with a diversity of virulence strategies through different mechanisms.54 Moreover, other resistance-related genes (such as Os01g02360, a receptor-like kinase) that may contribute to rice defence against R. solani were identified as well. Our analyses provided clues to investigate interactions between rice and R. solani, albeit future research are required to confirm the host resistance mechanisms.4. DiscussionOver 15,000 miRNAs have been identified in plants, animals, viruses, and some unicellular organisms.2,5,26,56,57 Many studies have reported that fungi encode Dicer-like and Argonaute proteins and that gene expression can be specifically knocked down using RNAi-based methods.58–61 To date, few miRNAs have been reported in plant pathogenic fungi, which could be due to the low accumulation of miRNA or the small number of cells at certain infection stages. Traditional sequencing of sRNAs preferentially identifies abundant miRNAs.62 As a result, less abundant or tissue-specific miRNAs may remain undiscovered in many organisms. Recently, sequencing technologies have allowed the generation of large libraries of sRNAs, which facilitates the identification of less abundant miRNAs.26 Here, a large number of sRNAs from different infection stages of R. solani AG1 were sequenced using high-throughput Illumina sequencing. Our results verified that the plant pathogen R. solani produces miRNAs and identified novel miRNAs in basidiomycetes. Future studies involving the construction of transformants overexpressing or knocking out particular miRNAs in R. solani AG1 will help to confirm their functions. Although the milRNA pathway remains poorly understood, our study provides important evidence for this pathway and broadens our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanism and biology of R. solani at the non-coding RNA level.The successful identification of miRNAs shows that MIREAP and miRDeep2 are powerful tools33,34 to identify candidate miRNAs based on high-throughput sequencing reads and reference genome sequences. For fungal milRNA discovery,8,9,13–15 fewer than 45 milRNAs were identified in each species from four sRNA sequencing libraries, with the exception of Aspergillus <U+FB02>avus.14 These studies of fungal milRNA8,9,13–15 suggest that the generation of more sequencing data from multiple libraries and the use of suitable prediction workflows should help identify milRNAs. For plant pathogens, the study of milRNAs expressed during infection is lacking. In our work, a method was proposed for fungal milRNA prediction in which the rice miRNA detection workflow was altered, which identified highly credible milRNAs supporting by at least 11 reads in one of the libraries. Sequence comparison indicates that 109 (61.58%) candidate milRNAs share partially conserved sequences with reported miRNAs, suggesting the high accuracy of milRNA prediction by our method as well. Moreover, confirmation of our results by RT-qPCR/RT-PCR supports the accuracy of milRNA identification. The dual-luciferase reporter assay has been used widely to validate human miRNA targets.63 Due to the lack of effective transformation systems and reporter genes for R. solani AG1 IA, HEK293T cells were transfected with a dual-luciferase reporter vector to validate predicted milRNA targets. In future work, we will explore methods to validate the predicted miRNA targets in rice sheath blight pathogen. Moreover, based on expression data obtained during the infection stages and on the pathogenic PPI subnetwork, the expression pattern and character of predicted R. solani miRNAs were revealed. This information could help us to understand pathogenic factors during key infection stages at the systems level. From our analysis, 15 candidate pathogenic milRNAs are identified (Table 2), which is supported by the expression of milRNAs and their target genes, and functions of targets, as well as PHI annotations. Although gene expression was affected by comprehensive factors, such as TFs and alternative splicing, infection-related milRNAs are important pathogenic factors. The results may suggest that the pathogenic mechanisms of milRNAs in the rice sheath blight pathogen are mediated by regulating target ABC-G transporter and hydrolase involved in drug resistance and translocation of various molecules and degrading the antimicrobial compounds from host after penetration respectively, by regulating virulence-associated factors associated with transduction signal pathway, by regulating TFs that may regulate pathogenic factors during infection, and by regulating cell wall-degrading enzymes involving in fungal pathogenicity (Table 2), albeit further research are required to confirm. Our future work will clarify the milRNA pathways and identify critical pathogenic factors. In addition, the diversity of virulence strategies in pathogens corresponds to different host defence response mechanisms,54 which is also supported by the identification of four rice miRNAs that seemed do not involve in rice immunity against M. oryzae55 but expressed during R. solani infection. The target genes of these four miRNAs included TFs that may represent major impacts on rice immunity against the rice sheath blight pathogen. As the mechanisms of interactions between R. solani and rice still remain poor understand, the discovery of rice miRNAs involved in host defence responses to R. solani will facilitate research on pathogen virulence and host resistance.

IntroductionThe MD-2 is one of the best tasting pineapple varieties, that is, not only good in terms of its flesh flavour, but also in its overall fruit appearance resulting in an increase in its marketing value. Taxonomically, the pineapple is derived from the Bromeliaceae family, under the order of Poales, which includes the grass, sedges and cattail family. The family hosts 56 genera with approximately 2,600 species and many of them are ornamental. In the family, pineapple is the only species with an active global trade for its flavourful fruits. The species is usually diploid with 2n = =501 and with an estimated haploid genome size of 526 Mb.2 Since the plant is self-incompatible and usually parthenocarpic, the plant is commonly propagated vegetatively. This method of cultural system is known to increase its heterozygosity and development of an inbred pure line is difficult if not impossible. The high level of heterozygosity in pineapple is a challenge with regards to decoding its whole genome. Nevertheless, with the advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics software, sequencing a complex heterozygous genome such as the pineapple is now feasible.The fruit is known to be non-climacteric, as it does not have the accompanied burst of ethylene production and respiration spike during ripening, as normally observed in climacteric fruits such as banana and tomato. More importantly, the fruit will not improve its flavour once harvested and post-harvest exposure to external ethylene application will only assist in degreening its skin but will not improve its palate. Current understanding of fruit ripening regulation is limited mainly to the climacteric fruits. By the virtue of the genomic tool available for the model plant (i.e. tomato), many of the key regulator to achieve ripening has been elucidated.3 In parallel, increasing number of studies are now devoted to understand the non-climacteric fruit, and various fruits have been proposed as the model plant to decipher non-climacteric fruit ripening. Several different hormones had been recognized in regulating fruit ripening.4 Nonetheless, the focus in the study of ripening has always been the ethylene hormone, as it is known to be produced abundantly during the process and its suppression deems to inhibit ripening of many fruit species.5,6 Altogether, these results have been inconclusive as to what control the climacteric switch in plant and no single model has been proposed to represent the regulation of non-climacteric fruit ripening.7 Many hypotheses have been proposed as to why the non-climacteric fruit can still ripen without the ethylene burst.In pineapple, general pathways and transcripts involved in its ripening process have been recognized through microarray analysis8 and comparative expressed-sequence-tag (EST) analysis,9 respectively. Moreover, assembly of pineapple fruit transcriptome RNASeq data has enriched transcriptomic database significantly.10 But, thus far, the role of ethylene or other hormones in the ripening process of pineapple fruit is still vague. This information is highly crucial as it leads to the revelation of the intricate regulation of ripening process in pineapple fruits, which ultimately enables us to better control its quality based on its economic preferences. With the advances in genomic sequencing technology, decoding a genome has become a routine procedure. However, the challenge lies in the assembly and in making sense of the big data being produced. Recently, the genome of pineapple has been published but the sample used to assemble the genome was derived from pineapple variety F153. This sequencing project, we have embarked on, is independent of the recently published genome assembly by Ming et al.11 of the F153 pineapple variety. In this paper, we report the sequence of the commercially important MD-2 pineapple which was assembled using predominantly error corrected long PacBio reads. With the challenges of repetitive and complex multi-allelic region of plant genomes, we believe that the long sequencing read technology is able to tackle the problem and to provide a complete genome assembly as it was shown with the human genome.12 It is our motivation, to solve the complex heterozygous genome of pineapple using the long sequencing read technology, but due to its low input and high error rate, the technology still requires error correction before it can be used directly in genome assembly, especially at medium coverage (i.e. less than ×30 coverage). In order to achieve this, we borrowed the accuracy from Illumina short reads to improve the long PacBio reads using novoLR package13 from Novocraft to perform the error correction. The genome serves as an example of how hybrid sequencing technology is feasible to assemble complex plant genome such as the pineapple.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe cultivated MD-2 pineapple was provided by the Malaysian Pineapple Industry Board. The variety was originally developed through a series of pineapple breeding programme and was initially released to Del Monte Fresh Produce Hawaii Inc for evaluation and commercialization. The variety was derived from a cross of another two distinct Pineapple Research Institute hybrids, namely 58-1184 and 59-44314 which contribute to its high Cayenne genetic background in MD-2.2.2. Sample preparation and sequencingSample preparations for sequencing using Illumina and PacBio platforms were as in Redwan et al.15 DNA sample extracted from pineapple leaves were processed for sequencing library preparation using TruSeq PCR-Free kit (Illumina) with 350 and 550 bp average insert sizes according to manufacturer protocol. The sequencing service and library preparation were provided by Macrogen, Korea. The two libraries were sequenced using HiSeq platform (Illumina), each on a single lane using 100 bp paired-end sequencing format. In addition, 750 bp average insert size sequencing library was also prepared in-house with minor modification to the manufacturer protocol. The library was then sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using the 300 bp paired-end sequencing format. All the sequence reads obtained from Illumina platforms were quality trimmed and length filtered using fqtrim software (available at: http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/fqtrim/ (9 June 2016 date last accessed)) to a minimum quality of Q20 and 50 bp in length. In conjunction, all of the Illumina adaptors were included in the parameter for fqtrim to perform adaptor trimming. Altogether, the three libraries provided 81.28 Gb of trimmed and filtered sequencing data which translated to ×154.7 coverage of the pineapple genome (Supplementary Table 1a).Library preparation for PacBio sequencing was performed on high-quality genomic DNA using P4-C2 and P5-C3 sequencing chemistry and library preparation according to PacBio Sample Net-Shared Protocol available online at http://www.pacb.com/ (9 June 2016 date last accessed). The 20 kb library was sequenced using PacBio RSII platform with 32 SMRT® cells. Final data of 14.85 Gb sequencing reads was pre-processed by SMRTBellCleaner™ software from Novocraft to align and trim SMRTbell™ adaptor from the filtered subreads of PacBio. This reduced the total long reads to 11.78 Gb in total size which was error corrected using the 350 and 750 bp sequencing library of Illumina short reads (Supplementary Table 1b).2.3. Contamination detectionPreliminarily, short reads assembly were attempted using ABySS software,16 but the assembly obtained were collapsed compared with the estimated genome size with N50 of only 5,564 bp. The contigs from the assembly were used to inspect for possible contamination of the sequence reads by using Blobology software.17 Ten thousand contigs with a size larger than 1,000 bp were randomly selected and were BLASTN against the nt database of NCBI in order to find the taxonomy classification of the best hits with E-value 10e-6. The trimmed, filtered reads were then mapped back to the contigs using novoAlign™ at default parameter to produce alignment BAM file which were then used to collate the gc coverage of the reads. Based on the taxid file of the contigs identity obtained from the similarity search and the gc distribution, the final results obtained were plotted using R-script makeblobplot.R from the Blobology software. Based on the taxon-annotated GC-coverage plots (Supplementary Fig. 1), the majority of contigs sampled formed only a single ‘blob’ represented mostly by Poales, the order taxonomical classification of pineapple. The majority of the sampled contigs had GC-content in between 20% and 60%. The plot showed the distribution of coverage of Illumina short reads and the MD-2 scaffolds mapping to the F153 pineapple genome assembly. These were the ‘linkage’ constructed that have high mapping coverage of short reads that match the same region where multiple scaffolds from MD-2 assembly mapped. The regions highlighted the high ‘multiplicity’ as shown in the COMPASS metrics. Different rows are for the different linkage of the F153 assembly and on the left are the mapping from the Illumina short reads and on the right are the respective mapping of the MD-2 scaffolds on the same linkage. For all of the linkages, the mapping covered throughout the genome, but may not be visible in the plot as the mapping value was undersized by the high coverage value.The plot showed the distribution of coverage of Illumina short reads and the MD-2 scaffolds mapping to the F153 pineapple genome assembly.

Error correction of long PacBio readsAdvancement in long-read sequencing technology such as from PacBio has proven to alleviate many of the difficulties in assembly plant genomes. However, direct use of PacBio in genome assembly is not possible at low to medium sequencing coverage, due to the innate high error rate of single-pass sequence reads. Thus, in order to improve the accuracy of the PacBio, high accuracy short reads library from 350 to 750 bp average insert size were used by using novoLR™ package13 developed by Novocraft. The programme is divided into two parts; pre-processing of the PacBio reads by novoLRcleaver™ and aligning and variant calling by novoAlign™ and novoLRcorrector™, respectively. Error correction began by mapping the short reads onto the long reads using the novoAlign™ programme and variant calling was performed using novoLRcorrector™ to produce error corrected PacBio reads. After error correction, the number of error-corrected read base was further reduced to 56% (8.34 Gb) of the initial total subreads produced (Supplementary Table 1b). Much of the data was lost because any subreads that were a replicate of each other (i.e. derived from the same DNA template) were removed by novoLRcleaver™ and only the longest replicates were chosen to represent the template. This is because reads at the same start and end will not help in improving the contiguity of the genome assembly; rather it would further complicate assembly process with the minor variants it may carry due to random error rate innate to PacBio sequencing profile. As the sequencing library preparation improved in terms of the template DNA fragment size (by increasing the BP start to 9,000 bp), more read base survived the novoLRcleaver™ process, as there were less shorter templates (Supplementary Table 1b).2.5. Genome assemblyThe genome of MD-2 pineapple was assembled using only the ×15.9 (8.34 Gb) of error corrected PacBio sequence reads, with highest read length of 27,913 bp and average read length of 4,684 bp. Assembly was performed using Celera Assembler software version 8.3rc1 (http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/) (9 June 2016, date last accessed) with parameters as summarized in Supplementary Table 2. The first assembly produced a draft with a total size that was 48% larger than the haploid genome size of pineapple and N50 of 25,277 bp. The expanded genome size from the assembly was due to the failure of the software to resolve the double haplotype that existed in the genome due to its high heterozygosity rate. An overlap-based assembly as adopted in Celera Assembler should be able to resolve low heterozygosity rate as it allows tolerant mismatch in the discovery of overlaps among the sequence reads. However, with higher allele differences between the haplotype, assembler may produce different composites of the polymorphic paths into the assembly,18 leading to the construction of different unitigs representing the variants observed and thus causing an inflated assembly.In order to reduce the redundancy that may be present in the assembly, contigs were binned into two based on length cut-off of 25,000 bp. The bin with contigs smaller than 25,000 bp were then mapped to another bin containing contigs larger than 25,000 bp using GMAP19 with default parameter and any shorter contigs with hits and target coverage of more than 80% were removed from the assembly. In addition, the error corrected PacBio reads were also mapped to the assembly to remove contigs with an average coverage of less than one, as it may represent a spurious combination of the polymorphic block not present in the genome.18 Mapping with the error-corrected PacBio reads onto the genome was performed using Blasr20 with parameter ‘-bestn 5 –minPctIdentity 90 –placeRepeatsRandomly’. At this point, the assembly did not improve much, with less than 16% reduction of the total size assembly compared with the original assembly. Furthermore, all of the Illumina short reads from the three libraries were mapped to the genome using novoAlign™ with parameter ‘-t 20,3 –hlimit 6 -H 20 -p 5,20 -r All 50’ producing a BAM alignment file. The mapping quality of the short reads was then accessed from the alignment file and the assembly was then disjointed at low-quality mapping site (Q-score of less than 10). Subsequently, the same method to reduce redundancy by a similar search as above was carried out again for the second time to the fragmented contigs but with length cut-off of 1,000 bp. Once again, the short reads were mapped to the draft using the same parameter for scaffolding purpose via BESST software21 after the previous fragmentation. Thereupon, the draft assembly achieved the total size of 508 Mb, which was 96.6% of the estimated genome size of a pineapple and improved N50 of 34,762 bp.The contiguity of the draft was further improved using multiple scaffold software for different sequence data. First, SSPACE-LongRead22 software was used to scaffold the draft using error corrected PacBio reads, then Quiver tool (default parameter) via SMRT analysis was used to perform consensus calling using uncorrected PacBio reads, followed by another round of scaffolding using in-house PacBio long transcripts sequence data of pineapple using GMAP as aligner and L_RNA_Scaffolder23 for scaffolding. The draft was then further improved using SSPACE-LongRead software but in this round, all filtered subreads uncorrected PacBio reads were used. Finally, consensus calling was performed on the final draft using novoLRpolish™, utilizing all the trimmed and filtered Illumina short reads, and uncorrected novoLRcleaver™ processed long PacBio reads. After multiple rounds of scaffolding, the draft assembly improved significantly with N50 of 153,084 bp, maximum scaffold length of 1,287,057 bp and a total assembly size of 524.070 Mb.Genome quality assessment was evaluated by remapping short reads, and the long reads error corrected PacBio to the final draft using novoAlign™ and Blasr, respectively. More than 91% of the short reads mapped to the genome in proper pairs and more than 96% of long PacBio reads mapped to the genome. The high percentage of reads mapped back to the draft suggests that most of the reads were incorporated into the genome and thus most of the genome were assembled. In addition, the genome was also evaluated using Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA)24 in order to identify the correct exon–intron structure of 248 Core Eukaryotic Genes (CEGs) in the assembly. The analysis found 99% of the CEGs and 90% of the match was complete. This number of CEG retrieved is higher than other genomes assembled using next generation sequencing technology; pear25 (98.4%), adzuki bean26 (86%) and date palm27 (94%). Mapping of MD-2 reference genome to the F153 pineapple assembly was performed using lastal alignment tool28 and the comparison metrics was produced using the COMPASS tool.29 Variant analysis was performed as in Wit et al.30 using minimum mapping quality of Q30.2.6. Repeat and gene annotationRepeat annotation was performed based on the advanced tutorial to construct repeat library from MAKER31 software. De novo identification of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITE) and Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were performed using MITE-Hunter32 and LTRharvest33 software, respectively. Consensus sequences from de novo repeat library were then combined with LTR identified using RepeatModeler, to constitute the final repeat library. Gene prediction and annotation were conducted using MAKER pipeline31 with gene predictor tools including SNAP,34 AUGUSTUS35 and GENEMARK-ES.36 mRNA sequencing of a tissue sample from the mature yellow fruit of local pineapple variety from Babagon, Sabah were sequenced using PacBio. In addition to our previous RNA-Seq assembly data10 on the mature yellow pineapple fruit, another RNA-Seq assembly was performed on the mature green pineapple fruit following the same method. However, de novo assembly of the mature green RNA-Seq sequences was performed using Oases-MK (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/ 9 June 2016, date last accessed), using the combination of kmer range from 23 to 65 in a step of two. The assembled transcripts were then clustered using TGI Clustering Tool37 software by default. All of these transcriptomic sequencing data in addition to the available pineapple EST data downloaded from Genbank NCBI were used as EST evidence to the predicted gene in the MAKER pipeline. Due to the limited transcriptome data to represent other tissues of pineapple, RefSeq protein sequences from Poales order were downloaded from NCBI to be recruited as the protein homology evidence. The final gene set contained 27,087 genes. In addition, tRNAscan-SE38 in MAKER pipeline was also enabled for identification of tRNA in the genome.Gene function was assigned according to best hit in a similar search against SwissProt and TrEMBL database39 using BLASTP at E-value cut-off of 1e-5. The gene ids were then modified to add the gene function according to the best hit search and genes with no identity were indicated as ‘Protein of unknown function’. Motifs and domain of the genes were determined using InterProScan40 v5.15-54.0 against multiple databases including Pfam, PROSITE, PRINTS, ProDom, SMART, Panther, TMHMM and SignalP_EUK with pathway and GO lookup. Gene features comparison across other sequenced genomes in subclass Commelinidae and Arabidopsis thaliana were performed using GenomeTool41 and protein homology search were carried out using OrthoMCL.42Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) including microRNA (miRNA), small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs) and other ncRNAs were identified using INFERNAL-v1.1 software43 using RFAM covariance database.44 In the analysis, for the case of overlap prediction, hit with higher E-value was selected.2.7. Phylogeny constructionSingle-copy gene among the nine taxa were obtained via orthology analysis using OrthoMCL.42,Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon and Aegilops tauschii were selected to represent Poacea family, and Musa acuminata and Elaeis guineensis to represent the non-Polaes order in subclass commelinid. A. thaliana was chosen to represent the dicotyledonous group for comparison and Amborella trichopoda were included as the most recent common ancestor among the angiosperm. Four hundred and nine single-copy genes identified by OrthoMCL were concatenated into a single super long sequence for each taxon. The sequences were then aligned by using the amino acid sequence as the guide via MAFFT.45 The aligned amino acids were then back translated using EMBOSS Backtranseq tool prior to subsequent phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the same matrix via GTR + GAMMA model implemented in RAxML.46 Gene family expansion and contraction was analysed using CAFÉ47 on the 1,000 largest core gene family shared across all taxa in the tree. Divergence times in the phylogenetic tree were estimated using RelTime method in MEGA6 calibrated using divergence time between Brachypodium and Oryza (40–45 million years ago)48 and Arabidopsis and Oryza (130–200 million years ago).492.8. Transcriptome analysisDifferential expression analysis in this study is part of an extension to the previously published de novo transcriptome of mature yellow pineapple fruit.10 All of the tissue samples and RNA extraction were performed concurrently as in Ong et al.10 The fruits were collected from a commercial pineapple field located at Babagon, Sabah. The fruit was a local variety but a variant of the Smooth Cayenne. Nevertheless, its average fruit size is smaller than Smooth Cayenne but with higher Brix value (ranges from 8 to 20°) and the pH value of the fruit ranges from 3.7 to 3.2. The green mature fruit and yellow mature fruit were harvested randomly at 12 and 16 weeks after flowering, respectively. The green mature fruit was fruit that had all of its eyes fully expanded but the skin was still green and the yellow mature fruit was a fruit harvested during the time when more than 80% of its eyes turned yellow. Total RNA was extracted by using the modified method of Li et al.50 Total RNA was sequenced using Genome Analyzer IIx and was sequenced in 75 bp paired-end format with average insert size of 200 bp. All sequence reads were filtered and trimmed using Perl script Condetri51 with a minimal length of 50 bp and average Q-score of 25. RNASeq reads were then mapped onto the draft genome and analysed for differential expression by using the Tuxedo suite pipeline.523. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assemblySequencing of the MD-2 pineapple was carried out using the two forefront sequencing platforms, Illumina and PacBio, to produce short and long sequencing reads, respectively. Genomic DNA was obtained from leaf tissues and was sequenced using the Illumina platform in three libraries, each with different average insert sizes; 350, 550 and 750 bp. The first two libraries each produced 42 Gbp and 46 Gbp of 100 paired-end reads, respectively, and the latter produced 9 Gbp of 300 bp paired-end reads. All of the reads were trimmed to yield a final coverage of ×154. Sequencing of 20 kb template size library on the PacBio platform produced 14.85 Gb sequence data. After error correction, the data was reduced to 8.34 Gb, which translated to a ×15.9 of high accuracy long sequencing reads of the pineapple genome. Maximum read length before the assembly was 37,591 bp which was reduced to 27,913 bp after error correction. Two approaches were taken to find the most optimum assembly: de novo assembly of only error corrected long PacBio reads using the well-known, Celera Assembler53 and the recent strategy of long reads assembly-based mapping on the de-bruijn assembled short reads contigs, implemented in DBG2OLC.54 After comprehensive comparison between the two assemblies, the Celera assembly was selected as it contained more CEGs as assessed with CEGMA and better mapability of the pineapple transcripts obtained from the NCBI database and in-house database (Table 1). Although DBG2OLC strategy produced larger N50, Celera assembly is superior in terms of its accuracy which is what we considered to be more important. After contiguity improvement using multiple software for scaffolding, the final Celera assembly contained 8,448 scaffolds covering 99.6% of the genome with 901 scaffolds (i.e. 50% of the assembly) at a length of at least 153,084 bp (i.e. N50). The CEGMA24 assessment found 245 out of 248 (98.8%) CEGs with 93.2% of the matches were with alignment spanning more than 70% (i.e. complete). In addition, more than 95% of the short reads mapped to the genome in a proper pair and 96% of the long PacBio reads mapped uniquely to the genome. Earlier before the advancement of next-generation sequencing, sequencing a heterozygous sample was thought to be impossible. Nowadays, with massive parallel sequencing technology of the second-generation sequencing such as Illumina and the long sequencing technology such as the PacBio platform, de novo assembly of the heterozygous diploid sample is feasible. Hybrid assembly of the heterozygous diploid sample of MD-2 pineapple is yet another evidence of its practicability. To our knowledge, this is the second genome published utilizing the hybrid sequence technology in plant genome assembly following the Chinese orchid herb55 but the first in showcasing its feasibility with diploid heterozygous plant sample. The N50 of the MD-2 pineapple draft assembly is lower than many of the inbred fruit tree genome assembly utilizing NGS but the total genome coverage in relative to their estimated genome size exceeds many other plant genomes. It is important to note that the N50 is higher in comparison to other draft assembly of complex samples such as the 20 Gbp white spruce,56 the 2.57 Gb hop57 and the weed horseweed.58 The integrity of the scaffold is good enough for gene annotation as shown by the number of CEGs found which was comparable to the Setaria italica draft genome59 but better than the draft genome of pear25 and the Chinese orchid.55 The number of the CEG found in full length and partial were also exceeded the recently published pineapple genome.11 Furthermore, more than 99% of 114,077 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of pineapple could be aligned to the genome with 87% of the matches had over 90% coverage and identity (Table 1). The cDNAs used for validation were derived from the previous fruit transcriptomic studies,10 pineapple EST sequences from Genbank and the new long RNA sequences derived from Iso-Seq sequencing using PacBio RSII. Transcripts mapped partially onto the genome could be used to further improve the gene annotation and assembly accuracy. Variant analysis of the MD-2 pineapple draft revealed one heterozygosity per 448 bp, which included 1,009,925 of SNPs and 183,133 of indels.

Pineapple F135 assemblyJust recently, a pineapple genome from variety F135 was published.11 Initially, the genome had suffered low assembly contiguity due to its heterozygosity and the problem was alleviated by using haplotype phasing. This method is made possible by phasing out the haplotype that was not present in the sequencing data of an F1 progeny which was derived from a cross between the sequenced sample and another variety. With ×400 Illumina reads, ×2 Moleculo synthetic long reads, ×1 454 reads, ×5 PacBio single-molecule long reads and 9,400 BACs, the assembly achieved scaffold N50 of 11.8 Mb and genome coverage of 72.6%. Similar to other short-reads-based assemblies, the assembly also falls short in assembling the repeats, leading to the reduced genome coverage. Nevertheless, the assembly provides as an intact reference for numerous genome studies in pineapple. In comparison to our genome assembly, our draft which was assembled using the only ×15.4 of error-corrected long PacBio reads and ×154 of Illumina reads (only for error-correction and scaffolding) is inferior in term of contiguity but is able to achieve higher genome coverage and contained a higher number of CEGs. Mapping of the assembly scaffold onto the F153 assembly using lastal28 confirmed our assembly validity, as the assembly could cover most of the F153 assembly (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, genome validation using the COMPASS tool showed that more than 89.7% of the F153 assembly was assembled in our genome. In addition, yet again the DBG2OLC assembly was not any superior to the CELERA assembly in term of coverage from the COMPASS metrics (Table 2). Despite of our larger assembly size, most of our assembled scaffolds were validated by the F153 assembly as shown by the validity metrics and parsimony. Due to our larger assembly size in comparison to F153 assembly, the validity metric scored higher than one, which denoted that there were more alignments of the assembly onto the reference than the total length of the reference itself. In addition, the parsimony metrics of 1.8 inferred that there was a slightly more of the assembled length than the total alignment length that can form the continuous coverage on the reference (i.e. coverage island). COMPASS metrics for CELERA and DBG2OLC assembly using the F153 assembly as referenceCOMPASS metrics for CELERA and DBG2OLC assembly using the F153 assembly as referenceInterestingly, both assemblies using the long error corrected reads showed replicated repeats in comparison to the F153 assembly and the multiplicity is larger in CELERA assembly as compared with the DBG2OLC, which contained smaller assembly total size. The problem of multiplicity can be highlighted from the high coverage peak observed upon the mapping of our assembly scaffolds onto the F153 assembly (Supplementary Fig. 2). In order to confirm the collapsed repeat in the region, the 350 bp Illumina library was mapped to the F153 assembly and similar plot was produced. Many of the high coverage peaks observed in the mapping of the scaffold to the F153 assembly were also observed at the same genome coordinate in the mapping of the Illumina reads (Fig. 1). In many genome evaluations, higher coverage at a certain region in genome indicates the problem of collapse repeats that had been assembled in fewer copies than in the real genome.60 The fact that there were more of our scaffolds mapped at the same region where there were extremely high short reads coverage, inferred that in our assembly this collapse repeats had been expanded and assembled in few scaffolds. However, due to a limited number of long reads to resolve the repeats, the scaffolds were not been able to be merged longer. Interestingly, at the regions where there high coverage mapping of our assembly onto the F153 assembly, there was no mapping found from the DBG2OLC scaffold. This showed that the region had been eliminated during assembly in DBG2OLC which altogether may reduce its complexity so as to enable the better contiguity as shown by its longer N50.3.3. Gene predictionProtein-coding genes were annotated using MAKER automated annotation software by recruiting pineapple transcriptome and RefSeq protein from Poales as evidence to the ab initio gene predictions. The prediction yielded 27,017 putative gene models and 90.6% of the proteins were classified into 4,396 unique protein family based on the PANTHER database. Putative gene function was assigned based on best homology match via Blastp to SwissProt and TrEMBL database and 94.8% of the genes were with putative function. In addition, protein domain of the gene models were assigned via InterProScan40 which identified 3,911 protein domain (based on Pfam database) in 20,937 genes (77.4% of all genes) and 15,293 of the predicted genes were annotated with at least one GO term (Supplementary Table 3). INFERNAL analysis by using RFAM covariance model to detect ncRNA families identified 215 miRNA, 9 rRNA, 347 snoRNA, 63 snRNA and 1250 other ncRNA. Four hundred and seventy-five tRNA were identified using tRNAscan-SE38 via MAKER pipeline. Overall, the pineapple genome had fewer predicted gene models than other species in the same subclass Commelinidae, however, it had a similar number when compared with A. thaliana (TAIR 10). As well as this, Coding DNA Sequence (CDS) length, gene length, exon length and the number of individual exons remained similar between Commelinidae and A. thaliana (Fig. 2). Comparison of the gene features among eight sequenced plant genomes including the pineapple. From top left is length distribution of (a) CDS, (b) exon and (c) gene, followed by (d) the exon number. There was no obvious difference observed for all features, except for gene length of S. bicolor and A. thaliana.Comparison of the gene features among eight sequenced plant genomes including the pineapple.

Repeat analysisA total of 236.9 Mb (45.21%) of repeated elements was identified in the unmasked Ananas comosus genome based on the advanced repeat library construction protocol by Maker (Fig. 3). The most abundant repeat elements was class I (LTR)/Gypsy elements, constituting about 18% (96 Mb) of the genome. Other class I LTR elements identified was LTR/Copia, representing 4.68% (20 Mb) of the genome and unclassified LTR element, consisting of 4.7% (24 Mb) of the genome. The occurrence of non-LTR class I only constituted of 2.5% (5 kb) of the genome for LINE elements, and 0.27% (1.2 kb) for SINE elements. Altogether, 10.4% (43 Mb) of the genome was identified to be class II DNA transposons, with the highest element being the unclassified DNA elements. In comparison to other Poales sequenced genome, the number of the repetitive elements were higher than rice (35%),61 date palm (21.9%),62 banana (26.9%)63 but lower than sorghum (61%)64 and comparable with the foxtail millet genome (46%).59Pie charts show the percentage of different repeated elements identified in MD-2 pineapple genome. The most abundant components identified were LTR/Gypsys, DNA Class II transposons and followed by unidentified LTR and LTR/Copia.Pie charts show the percentage of different repeated elements identified in MD-2 pineapple genome.

Comparative analysis of orthologous genes and phylogenetic analysisOrthologs analysis with other Commelinidae subclass sequenced genomes, unveiled 9,701 gene families in common to A. comosus and four other sequenced genomes in its same subclass, namely O. sativa, B. distachyon, M. acuminata and E. guineensis (Fig. 4). The largest cluster from the common orthologous group among the six species consisted of 471 proteins, with 21% of the members derived from M. accuminata and 19% from E. guineensis. These proteins were with similarity hit to Leucine Rich Repeat receptor-like serine-threonine-protein kinase which was known to be highly duplicated in plant genome as the gene family underwent several rounds of recombination, resulting in gene death and birth within the family.65 In addition, the orthologous analysis also showed 902 clusters unique only to A. comosus. These clusters may contain the in-paralog specific to the gene families of A. comosus or genes that have underwent sufficient structural rearrangement, causing enough variation to be unique only to the genome. Venn diagram illustrates the shared orthologous gene cluster among pineapple and four other sequenced grass genomes, namely M. acuminata, E. guineensis, B. distachyon and O. sativa. Orthology analysis was performed using OrthoMCL.Venn diagram illustrates the shared orthologous gene cluster among pineapple and four other sequenced grass genomes, namely M. acuminata, E. guineensis, B. distachyon and O. sativa. Orthology analysis was performed using OrthoMCL.A phylogenetic tree was constructed using 409 single-copy genes shared by pineapple and nine other angiosperm species (Fig. 5). The topology of the tree followed that of the current angiosperm classification,66 placing the pineapple at the base after the divergent of the Poales from other member of its subclass. The grass family formed the largest evolutionary distance (depicted by the branch length) as compared with other members of the commelinid, suggesting significant genome variations across the family than other commelinids. This is in agreement with the recent chloroplast study in subclass Commelinidae, where major modifications to the chloroplast genome was observed only among the grass family.15 On the other hand, pineapple maintained relatively similar genetic distance with M. acuminata, which inferred substantial genetic conservation in pineapple as compared with other Poales after the divergent from commelinid. Comparison of GC content across transcripts (CDS) from all nine taxa also supported genetic similarity between pineapples to the banana than to other Poales members (Supplementary Fig. 3). Phylogenetic tree, gene family contraction and expansion and time line divergence of pineapple among the subclass Commelinidae. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using 409 single-copy-genes shared by pineapple and six other Commelinidae and A. thaliana and Am. trichopoda were included as the out-group. Pie charts at each node depict the gene family expansion and contraction and underlined number at each node represents the divergence of pineapple from other commelinids in millions of years ago (MYA). Divergent time was calculated using RelTime using the same matrix used to construct the phylogenetic tree.Phylogenetic tree, gene family contraction and expansion and time line divergence of pineapple among the subclass Commelinidae.

Pie charts at each node depict the gene family expansion and contraction and underlined number at each node represents the divergence of pineapple from other commelinids in millions of years ago (MYA). Divergent time was calculated using RelTime using the same matrix used to construct the phylogenetic tree.In addition, common gene family clusters across all nine taxon which were inferred to be the conserved gene family across the angiosperm were inspected for contraction and expansion. The analysis revealed significant contraction of the gene member had occurred since divergent of Poales from the commelinid and the largest expansion of the orthologous clusters gene members occurred in Zingiberales and Arecales, represented by M. acuminate and E. guineensis, respectively. Many of the green plant sequenced thus far showed large-scale duplication events which may lead to speciation but most importantly to drive evolution forward. The orthologus cluster gene expansion analysed in this study showed the largest expansion was observed in Zingiberales which is known to have at least three duplication events that were not shared by the Poales.67 However, the contraction event observed among Poales in this analysis does not eliminate the occurrence of expansion event among the groups. Strong evidence in previous studies have been shown to support whole genome duplication among the Poales in at least a single event after divergent from commelinid.68 It is interesting to note that across taxa, the largest gene reduction was observed in pineapple. In parallel of pineapple’s low gene density (33% reduction as compared with 430 Mb rice genome), genome-wide gene reduction unique to the species may have occurred. This hypothesis can be investigated through comparative genomic by synteny analysis but with the level of contiguity presented in this draft, this sort of analysis is computer-intensive and difficult for inference as the scaffolds are not presented at the chromosome size. In addition, the divergent time between A. comosus and the grass family was estimated to be circa 110.38 Myr and the split of the commelinid was estimated to be around 128 Myr, in accordance with the commelinid divergent time estimated in previous study.693.6. Role of ethylene in pineapple fruit ripeningIn the study of fruit ripening, ethylene has been the focal point in dissecting this complex process, as the hormone is emitted abundantly during ripening. But this is only true with the climacteric fruits and the role of the hormone has only been clearly deciphered in fruits that release and respond to the hormone to induce their ripening process (i.e. climacteric fruits). In non-climacteric fruits, there are still large gaps of knowledge and arguments on the role of ethylene in this group of fruits which do not produce and response to ethylene during their ripening process. In bridging this gap, we performed differential expression analysis of the mature pineapple fruits RNASeq libraries differing in their level of ripening as determined by their skin colour. Overall, 99 genes were differentially expressed (>2-fold) at a significant level of P < 0.0001 (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 4), but for the sake of brevity, the focus is given only to ethylene-related transcripts.Among the differentially regulated transcripts identified, four of the seven transcripts categorized under transcription regulator were related to ethylene and these were the ERF109, ERF3, ERF008 and TEM1 AP2/ERF and B3 domain transcription repression. The presence of differentially regulated ethylene-related transcription factors in pineapple fruit supports the current notion of the involvement of ethylene in non-climacteric fruit ripening, despite the absence of ethylene burst during its ripening process.70 In addition, a transcript, ACMD2_01443, with homology to ACO1 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 1) gene was also down-regulated. The product of this gene is known to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of ethylene together with the ACS (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) gene. The ACS gene were present in the genome in seven copies, but none were differentially regulated (Fig. 6). Similar observation of ACO gene down-regulation was made in other non-climacteric fruits, namely strawberry70 and grape.71 In climacteric fruits, ACO expression can be varied, with a different copy of the ACO genes up-regulated and down-regulated significantly through ripening. The various expression pattern of ACO copies during ripening of climacteric fruits were denoted to different copies of the ACO gene required to maintain system I and to induce system II.7Biosynthesis of ethylene and expression of its two rate-limiting enzymes, ACC Synthase (ACS) and ACC Oxydase (ACO). This figure depicts the biosynthetic pathway of ethylene, which is integral to the YANG cycle. Seven and 13 transcripts were identified in the genome with a putative function to ACS and ACO, respectively, and only one ACO transcript (i.e. ACMD2_01443) was differentially regulated during ripening of pineapple fruit.

Asterisk marks the significantly differentially regulated transcript.Recent studies showed that young non-climacteric fruit of strawberry and citrus produced ethylene burst prior to ripening and then it gradually subsided as ripening continues.70 The ethylene burst occurred was in concomitant with the high ACO expression and thus, the gene may be responsible for the transient peak in non-climacteric fruit ripening. It is interesting to investigate whether the down-regulation of ACO gene observed in pineapple and the peak observed in green mature fruit followed the same ethylene production pattern. Further physiological study of pineapple fruit ripening is required to support the hypothesis. It is important to note that not all fruits in the same climacteric pattern carry the same mechanism to achieve ripening, as some differences may occur. For example, although most of the climacteric fruits have varied expression pattern of the ACO copies during ripening, differential expression analysis of pear fruit revealed that all four copies of the ACO gene were up-regulated.72 But the key to their similarity is that the high expression of the ACO gene occurred in concomitant with the ethylene burst and is maintained through until the fruit ripens. The similar key for the non-climacteric fruit to achieve ripening is hoped to be deciphered in the near future.There are two hypotheses, as to why the non-climacteric fruits do not undergo auto-induced system II ethylene. First, an investigation using two melon varieties with differing climacteric pattern suggests blockage in the auto-induced synthesis of ethylene.73 This hypothesis cannot be inferred in other genomes as the loci causing the blockage is not yet elucidated but it is known that it does not relate to ethylene controlling enzyme (i.e. ACS, ACO) and ethylene receptor gene (ERS) based on genetic mapping.73 Second, the study of the strawberry fruit ripening proposes that the non-climacteric fruits function with type-II ethylene receptor, and thus do not require abundant ethylene because the ethylene negative regulators, CTR is loosely bound by the type-II ethylene receptor (i.e. as compared with type I in climacteric fruit). Thus, only minimal amount of ethylene is required to release the CTR from negatively regulating the ethylene response pathway.70 In the pineapple genome, there were five copies of the type-II ethylene receptor (ETR2) and six copies of type-I ethylene receptor (a single ETR1 copy and five of ERS1) (Fig. 7). However, unlike in strawberry, none of the ethylene receptors mentioned above were differentially regulated. Nonetheless, most of them were expressed during the ripening process and one copy of ETR2 gene had constantly high Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million value in comparison to all other receptors. Similarly, no significant changes of the ETR2 expression was observed during ripening of capsicum fruit but another variant of type-II ethylene receptor ETR4 were found constantly abundant throughout ripening of the fruit and upon exposure to ethylene inhibitor the expression decreased significantly and the ripening was delayed.74 In grape ETR2 expression increased as ripening progressing in concomitant with the type-I ethylene receptor, ETR1.71 Although it is inconclusive to determine the contribution of ETR2 in inducing ethylene response pathway in pineapple, its high expression in both green and yellow mature fruit over the type-1 receptor suggested its importance to achieve ripening. Non-climacteric ripening may not require the ethylene burst to be maintained throughout the ripening process, but the initial burst as observed in strawberry and citrus may probably be sufficient to utilize similar ethylene response pathway and to promote ethylene-dependent genes to achieve ripening. Regulation of ethylene production, from left is class I, auto-inhibition and class II auto-catalytic and level of expression of ethylene receptors during ripening of pineapple fruit. In class I, during the basal level of ethylene production, ethylene response pathway does not occur as the negative regulator (CTR) is bound and activated by the ethylene receptors, which lead to subsequent degradation of EIN2, EIN3 and EIL1 through ubiquitination by SCP complex and 26 proteosome. In class II, the presence of the hormone will further induce its production, leading to ethylene spike observed during floral senescence and fruit ripening process. Most importantly, the binding of ethylene at its receptors will release and inactivate the CTR, promoting cleavage of carboxyl end of EIN2 to the nucleus and activate the nuclear transcription factor EIN3/EIL1 and ERF1, which induce the ethylene responsive genes. Two types of ethylene receptors have been identified at the ER lumen. It is hypothesized that non-climacteric fruits rely on type-II ethylene receptor, which binds to CTR more loosely compared with type-I. Thus, only minimal amount of ethylene required to release the negative regulator, CTR. On the left is the heatmap of the transcripts with homology to ethylene receptors. None of the ethylene receptors were differentially expressed, but one transcript with homology to ETR2, type II ethylene receptors was the highest expression in green mature fruit.Regulation of ethylene production, from left is class I, auto-inhibition and class II auto-catalytic and level of expression of ethylene receptors during ripening of pineapple fruit.

Sequencing a heterozygous genome is proven feasible by combining the long PacBio reads with the highly accurate Illumina short reads as they complement each other. The short reads even though they are highly accurate, they are not been able to resolve large tandem repeats that may exist in the genome. Similarly, the long reads even though they are long and may extend through the large repeats and complex region, at low sequencing outputs its accuracy hinders its use independently. Transcriptomic study of ripening pineapple fruit with the assistance of the draft genome as a reference suggests a similar role of ethylene in the regulation of ripening in non-climacteric tropical pineapple fruit. The availability of pineapple draft genome will revamp pineapple research as more molecular applications are now feasible to achieve greater understanding in the biology of pineapple.Data availabilityThis Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession LSRQ00000000.

IntroductionIn the genetic codes, although synonymous codons encode the same amino acid, these codons are not used with equal proportions. Certain synonymous codons, known as the optimal codons (OCs), are preferred to the other codons, as witnessed more prominently in the high expression genes (HEGs) in genomes.1,2 The selection on OCs in the HEGs is reportedly a function of cellular adaptation for faster and/or more accurate translation.3–7 Different factors such as genome G + C%,8 anticodon modification and codon–anticodon interaction4,9–12 and tRNA gene numbers13–17 are believed to influence OC selection in the HEGs in bacteria. In addition to the above, selection on mRNA secondary structure and stability,18–22 protein structure,23 protein folding kinetics,6,24–26 are known to influence codon usage bias in genes.Whether the selection of OCs is dependent upon these extrinsic factors mentioned above or upon the triplet sequence itself, has not been explored in detail. One of the approaches to find out the influence of the nucleotide sequence itself on their selection as OCs for different amino acids is to study and compare the OCs for different amino acids across different bacteria. A simple assumption is that the extrinsic factors influencing codon usage bias is likely to vary across bacteria but the intrinsic feature of a codon remains invariable. In this regard, there are several reports of analysis of the OCs in bacteria. Sharp et al. (2005)27 observed that the C-ending codons of Phe, Tyr, Asn and Ile are always used as the OCs in preference to the U-ending codons in different species of bacteria. The findings of Sharp et al. (2005)27 were in support of the earlier observation that growth rate influences the strength of translational selection in bacteria.15 So, it is the C-ending codons in these amino acids that are selected as the OCs across bacteria.27–29 Sharp et al. (2005)27 analysed only the WWY codons of the four amino acids that are decoded by one anticodon each. Whether the observation is also valid for the other three amino acids such as His, Asp and Cys that are encoded only by the NNY codons was not explored in their study.In case of amino acids encoded by six or four synonymous codons, there are isoacceptor tRNAs in an organism for decoding these codons. The variation of the copy number of the isoacceptor tRNAs, multiple codon–anticodon interactions increase the variability of the extrinsic mechanisms in the selection of the OC in a bacterium. Recently, we reported that GGU and CGU with respect to Gly and Arg, respectively are selected as the OCs in bacteria.30 This finding is important because both Gly and Arg are encoded by the codons belonging to the 4- and 6-fold degenerate families, respectively. This study30 indicates that the sequence of nucleotides in a triplet is important for OC selection.Published articles on the roles of the extrinsic factors such as genome composition and tRNA gene number on the selection of OCs have not provided any conclusion in this regard.8,31 To address the above issue, we analysed the codon usage bias in all the 18 amino acids (Met and Trp encoded by one codon each were not considered) in 221 different species of bacteria belonging to 15 different phylogenetic groups. Comparison of the codon usage bias between the HEGs and the whole genome vis-à-vis the genome composition suggested that there is amino acid specific influence with regard to OC selection across bacteria. What is interesting is that only some of synonymous codons are selected as the OCs across bacteria. It was also observed that OCs for some amino acids can be different among bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic groups. Observations in this study indicate that the intrinsic differences among the synonymous codons may contribute towards their abundance values in a genome and in the choice of specific synonymous codon as the OC with respect to particular amino acid.2. Materials and methodsGene sequences of the bacterial genomes considered in the present study were downloaded from the DDBJ site (www.gib.genes.nig.ac.jp) (the gene sequences were taken from the site in 2011). Several HEG sequences (ribosomal protein, translation factor, rpoB and rpoC gene sequences)27 were also taken from the NCBI site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The total tRNA gene numbers were collected from the Genomic tRNA Database (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu), which uses tRNAscan-SE to classify tRNA into different groups on the basis of their anticodon sequences.32 In this study, we considered 221 unique species of bacteria whose tRNA gene numbers and gene annotations were available in the online databases. These bacteria were with genomic G + C% between 72.83 and 22.44 and belong to 15 different phylogenetic groups of bacteria (Table 1b).  Bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic groups and their genomic G + C% considered in the present studyNote: Aquificae, Chlorobi and Chloroflexi groups consisting of only one bacterium each are not considered in the result analysis shown in Fig. 1b. Bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic groups and their genomic G + C% considered in the present studyNote: Aquificae, Chlorobi and Chloroflexi groups consisting of only one bacterium each are not considered in the result analysis shown in Fig. 1b.In general, the codons present in greater abundance and therefore used more frequently in the HEGs in comparison to all the genes in the genome are considered as the OCs.4,30 In our study here, to avoid the borderline cases, we considered those codons as the OCs, which are with abundance values of 5% or higher in the HEGs than the same with respect to all the genes of the genome. Codon abundance values, synonymous codon frequency ranks and the percentage of amino acid usage were calculated using a computer programme written in the C language. Figures were plotted using the Microsoft Excel. The relative synonymous codon usage values (RSCU) of codons were calculated according to the formula given by Sharp and Li (1986).33 RSCUdiff is defined as the subtraction value between the RSCU value of a codon in the HEGs and the RSCU value of a codon in the genome.3. Results3.1. Optimal codons for different amino acids do not follow a common pattern with regard to genome compositionThe study was based on the codon usage bias in 221 bacteria (Supplementary Table 1). The bacteria considered in this study included single strain from different species and also contained bacteria from 15 different phylogenetic groups. The 221 bacteria were divided into two groups depending on the total number of tRNA genes present in their genomes: (i) the high tRNA number (HTN) group having a number of tRNA genes = 50 and (ii) the low tRNA number (LTN) group having the number of tRNA genes < 50. Bacteria included in the HTN were presumed to have a strong translational selection in codon usage bias and those included in the LTN were presumed to have a weak translational selection as had been defined earlier.15,31 Both HTN and LTN bacteria were further arranged in different groups according to their genome G + C%. As the maximum G + C% known in bacterial genomes is 75%, five different groups were made ranging from the very high (VH) G + C% to the very low (VL) G + C% genomes as follows: VH (G + C% = 65), high (H; 55 = G + C% < 65), moderate (M; 45 = G + C% < 55), low (L; 35 = G + C% < 45) and VL (G + C% < 35). The HTN included total 119 bacteria whereas the LTN included 102 bacteria (Table 1a). Number of bacteria studied in the HTN and the LTN groupsVH (very high; G + C% = 65), H (high; 55 = G + C% < 65), M (moderate; 45 = G + C% < 55), L (low; 35 = G + C% < 45) and VL (very low; G + C%<35).Number of bacteria studied in the HTN and the LTN groupsVH (very high; G + C% = 65), H (high; 55 = G + C% < 65), M (moderate; 45 = G + C% < 55), L (low; 35 = G + C% < 45) and VL (very low; G + C%<35).In several instances, bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic groups are also found with restricted genome G + C composition. For example, Actinobacteria and ß-Proteobacteria are with high genome G + C composition, whereas Firmicutes and Tenericutes are with low genome G + C composition. In this study, the number of bacteria from the different phylogenetic groups considered for analysis of OC is variable. To find out if there is specific OC choice in bacteria according to their phylogenetic group, that might have been overlooked during analysis by dividing the bacteria according to genome G + C composition as described above, analysis of OCs was also performed in these bacteria by dividing them into different groups according to their phylogeny (Table 1b). Therefore, the OCs for the different amino acids were found out in the above bacteria on the basis of genome composition as well as phylogenetic affiliations (Table 1a and b;Fig. 1a and b). The OC compositions in different amino acids grouped under different degenerate codons were as follows. Optimal codons of 18 amino acids in the HTN and in the LTN groups of bacteria within different genomic G + C% groups. A codon is considered as the OCs if it is used more frequently in the set of HEGs in comparison to all the genes in a genome. In our study here, to avoid any borderline cases, we considered those codons as the OCs, which are with abundance values of 5% or higher in the HEGs than the same with respect to all the genes of the genome. OCs were found out in 221 bacteria (Supplementary Table 1). The bacteria were considered in two groups: (A) HTN and (B) LTN. Further, in each of the two groups, bacteria were grouped into five sub-groups according to their genome G + C% (i) VH, 65.0 = G + C%; (ii) H, 55.0 = G + C% < 65.0; (iii) M, 45.0 = G + C% < 55.0; (iv) L, 35.0 = G + C% < 45.0 and (v) VL, G + C% < 35.0. Numbers of bacteria considered in each sub-group were given in Table 1. The colour code is used to represent % of bacteria in the G + C% group where the codon was observed more frequent in the HEGs than the whole genome.

As described earlier for Fig.1a, the OCs found out in 221 bacteria and were considered in 15 groups (Table 1b) according to the phylogeny. Out of the 15 groups, three groups having only one bacterium each were not considered for further analysis.

The colour code is used to represent % of bacteria in the phylogenetic group where the codon was observed more frequent in the HEGs than the whole genome. For the raw data, please refer to Supplementary Supplementary Table 3.3.2. Optimal codons for the amino acids encoded only by the Y-ending codonsOnly the C-ending codons were found as the OCs for the five amino acids, viz, Asn, Asp, His, Phe and Tyr (Table 2) in all the bacteria irrespective of the genome G + C compositions. The observation was also consistent across the different phylogenetic groups (Table 2). Selection of the C-ending codons in these amino acids can be explained on the basis of codon–anticodon interaction.28 The only anticodon G34 (G at the first anticodon position) is used to decode both the synonymous codons of an amino acid. The C3:G34 (C3: C at the third codon position; G34: G at the first anticodon position) pairing at the wobble position is preferred to the U3:G34 pairing at the same position. But the same explanation is not tenable in case of the Cys codons. In the case of Cys, though the C-ending codon was found to be the OC in the high G + C% genomes as we observed for the other amino acids discussed above, the U-ending codon was the OC in the low G + C% genomes. Our observation here for the Cys codons is consistent with the observations made earlier by Iriarte et al. (2013)34 in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Usually, the abundance of Cys is not high in the proteome of an organism. Whether this is the reason for the exceptional behaviour of the Cys codons in the low G + C% genomes is not known. In case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, UGU was observed as the selected codon in the HEGs.35,36 Wald et al. (2012)29 gave an additional explanation of translational accuracy to explain the selection of C3 to U3 in amino acids encoded only by the Y-ending codons in the split codon boxes (the four codons in a box are not synonymous; His and Gln are encoded by split codon box). In a split codon box, usually the U34 anticodon decodes the NNR codons (the Gln codons, for example) while the G34 anticodon decodes NNY codons (the His codons, for example). While the G34 accurately decodes the NNY codons, the U34 apart from accurately decoding the NNR codons has a possibility of wrongly coding the U3 codon of the split codon box. So to avoid the translational error in the HEGs due to mispairing of the U34 anticodon with the U3 codon of a split codon box, the C3 codons are selected more than the U3 codons in these genes. As the UGG codon for Trp (Trp and Cys are part of the same spilt codon box) is decoded by the C34 anticodon, the greater abundance of the U3 codon Cys is not likely to be a problem for the cell. If it is true, then the observations in the case of Cys should also have been extended to the Tyr (UAY) and Ile (AUY) codons as there is no U34 anticodon in these two split codon boxes. While in the case of Tyr, the selection of U-ending codon was not observed in general, in case of Ile, the selection of U-ending codon was observed in some bacterial groups. It is pertinent to note that there is a strong G:C base pairing at the second codon position in case of the Cys codons, and there is absence of any G:C base pairing at the first and the second codon positions in case of Ile and Tyr codons, which makes the C-ending codon more important for Ile and Tyr than in the case of Cys. The other possibility that selection of the U-ending codons in the HEGs might be an adaptation against the non-sense error,37 i.e. the release factor has an erroneous preference to UGC than to UGU to cause premature translation termination. But this argument contradicts the selection of UGC in the high G + C genomes and also the selection of the C-ending codon in case of Tyr, which is encoded by the spilt codon box having stop codons. The other possibility of the selection of OCs in the direction of genome composition may be attributed to more stable mRNA secondary structure of HEGs. A general pattern indicating amino acid specific determination of OCs in different bacterial groups*All are statistically significant (chi-square significance test P value < 0.01).A general pattern indicating amino acid specific determination of OCs in different bacterial groups*All are statistically significant (chi-square significance test P value < 0.01).3.3. Optimal codons for the amino acids encoded only by the R-ending codonsIn case of Glu, the A-ending codon was found as the OC across all G + C compositions. In case of Gln and Lys, the G-ending codons were found as the OC in G + C% high genomes while the A-ending codons were found as the OC in low G + C% genomes. Observations in the HTN and LTN were similar. The analysis in bacteria revealed that the selection of OCs was phylogeny specific in case of Glu. For example, in Actinobacteria (high G + C) and Spirochaetes (low G + C) the GAG was the OC whereas in ß-Proteobacteria (high G + C) and Firmicutes (low G + C) the GAA was the OC. In case of y-Proteobacteria, GAA is selected as the OC, irrespective of genome composition. Glu is an example where the OC is selected according to the phylogenetic affiliation of the bacteria but not by genome G + C%. Earlier, it was demonstrated that GAA was a favoured codon over GAG in the HEGs in Escherichia coli and the speed of translation was higher in case of GAA than that of GAG.38,39 Unlike the amino acids encoded by the Y-ending codons described before, for the amino acids encoded by the NNR codons, bacteria uses either U34 or both U34 and C34 anticodons: the U34 can decode both the A3 and the G3 codons, while the C34, decodes only the G3 codons. While the occurrence of the U34 is there in all bacteria, the C34 is generally found in bacteria with high G + C genomes.40 The availability of two anticodons increases the effectiveness/probability of codon–anticodon pairing for an amino acid. Though the C34 anticodon usually occurs in the high G + C% genomes, in case of ß-Proteobacteria, in spite of being high G + C genomes, C34-Glu anticodon was not observed.40 This might be due to the fact that GAA is selected as the OC in this group of bacteria. In the case of Actinobacteria, which is also high G + C genome, where the GAG codon was selected as the OC, the C34-Glu was present in all the bacteria in this group.40 However, in case of Spirochaetes, C34-Glu was not found in all the bacteria, though GAG was selected as the OC. This indicates that the occurrence of C34 is not essential for the GAG selection as the OC, rather some phylogeny specific feature may contribute for its selection.The U34 modification is same in case of tRNA of Gln (tQ), Glu (tE) and Lys(tK).10 However, the choice of OC in case Glu was not found to be the same as for Lys and Gln in all the bacteria under consideration. A recent study with anticodon modifying enzyme in eukaryotes have revealed that the hypomodification of U34 affects translation of CAA and AAA codons of Gln and Lys, but not GAA,12 the codon of Glu. This indicates that choice of OC in case of these three amino acids may not be always dependent upon the anticodon modification. In the Tenericutes, Chlamydiae and <U+03F5>-Proteobacteria with low G + C genomes, no OC was evident as far as these three amino acid codons are concerned, though the selection of OC for the other amino acids was observed in these bacteria. The reason for the lack of specific choice of any synonymous codons as an OC in these groups needs further investigation. In case of Lys and Gln, the G-ending codon selection in the case of low G + C Spirochaetes was found as an exception also.Krüger et al. (1998)41 reported that the different modifications of the U34 nucleotide in the anticodon of tE had different effects on the decoding rates of the GAA and GAG codons. Anticodon modifying enzymes has an impact on the selection of OC in bacteria.4 It has been demonstrated now that this modification is important for the rate of decoding of the cognate codons in tune with the kinetics of translation and co-translational protein folding.12 Therefore, a detailed study of the effect of U34 modification enzymes on the anticodon of tRNA in decoding the codons of split boxes will give insight into the role of these enzymes and the choice of the OC in bacteria belonging to different phylogenetic groups.3.4. Optimal codon for IleThe C-ending codon was the OC in most of the bacteria while the U-ending codon was the OC in some low G + C genomes such as Tenericutes and Chlamydiae. Observations with respect to the HTN and the LTN were similar (Table 2). As has been discussed above, the selection of AUU as the OC in some low G + C bacteria in case of Ile is likely to have similarity with Cys due to the absence of the U34 anticodon for the split codon box. Except in some bacteria belonging to Firmicutes, AUA was generally not observed as the OC in any other group of bacteria. AUA is a rare codon in bacteria, which is decoded by the anticodon CAU. The C34 is modified to k2C34, to make correct pairing with AUA and to avoid incorrect pairing with the AUG codon.42 There are also instances where AUA is decoded by U34 in some specific groups of bacteria.43 The intrinsic feature such as the UA dinucleotide, which is generally avoided in the HEGs in bacteria,44 might be a reason for AUA not being the OC in bacteria.3.5. Optimal codon for the amino acids encoded only by the 4-fold degenerate family box codonsBased upon the choice of the OCs in bacteria, in general, the five amino acids, viz., Ala, Gly, Pro, Thr and Val, can be divided into three groups—first, in case of Ala, Thr and Val, the C-ending codons were found as the OC in the high G + C% genomes while the U-ending codons were found as the OC in the low G + C% genomes; second, in the case of Gly, both the U-ending and the C-ending codons were found as the OC in the high G + C% genomes, while only the U-ending codon was found as the OC in the low G + C% genomes; third, in case of Pro, the G-ending codon was found as the OC in the G + C% high genomes while the A-ending codon was found as the OC in the G + C% low genomes (Table 2). Therefore, in these five amino acids either the Y-ending codons or the R-ending codons were observed as the OCs in bacteria. The HTN and the LTN groups were similar for all the amino acids with respect to the OC.The observation of more than one OCs for these amino acids in a genome is possible due to higher degeneracy. We analysed the OCs for these five amino acids in different bacteria according to their phylogenetic affiliations (Table 2). Bacteria use different isoacceptor tRNAs to decode the four different synonymous codons in a family box, which is described under various sparing strategies.10 Choice of OCs in family box codons is influenced by anticodon modification and tRNA gene copy number in bacteria.4 The modification of U34 in tRNAs across different family box codons is similar and this modification is different from that of the U34 in tRNAs of split codon boxes.10 In case of Gly, the Y-ending codons were selected as the OC across different groups of bacteria. It has been reported earlier that decoding of the GGG codon is prone to -1 frameshift during translation.45 This might be a reason for the less preference of this codon in the HEGs. In case of Pro, the CCC codon was not selected as the OC in bacteria which might be due to the fact that this codon is prone to +1 frameshift during translation.46 Apart from this, translation speed is hindered by the Pro codons both at the ‘P’ and the ‘A’ sites of a ribosome due to the difference in the chemical structure of this amino acid from the other amino acids.47 In a case similar to Gly, the G-ending codons were not selected as the OC in case of Val, Ala and Thr, across different groups of bacteria. We believe that the intrinsic nature of these codons of different amino acids is likely to contribute towards their choice of OCs in bacteria.The choice for the OCs is likely to be influenced by the tRNA gene copy number in bacteria. The gene copy number of G34 anticodon, which is used to decode the Y-ending codons, is higher for Gly and is lower for Pro than the G34 anticodons for the other amino acids.40 This is in concordance with the choice of GGU/GGC as the OC(s) and avoidance of CCC as an OC in bacteria. Transfer RNA with either U34 or G34 at the wobble position can pair with either the R-ending or the Y-ending codons, respectively. Therefore, if the GGG triplet is not favoured as the OC, there will be no selection for the higher copy number of the tRNA with U34 anticodon. Low U34 tRNA will automatically not prefer the GGA triplet as the OC. Therefore, in general, either the Y-ending or the R-ending codons are being selected as the OC for these amino acids in bacteria. As the G-ending codon in Val and Ala are not preferred as the OC, the C34 is also a less preferred anticodon for these amino acids.403.6. Optimal codon for the amino acids encoded by 6-fold degenerate codonsDepending upon the choice of the OCs across bacteria, the three amino acids Arg, Leu and Ser can be divided into two groups—first, both U-ending and C-ending codons were found as the OC in the high G + C% genomes, while only the U-ending codon was found as the OC in the low G + C% genomes, in the case of Arg; second, in the case of Ser and Leu, the C-ending and the G-ending codons were found as the OC in the high G + C% genomes, while the U-ending and the A-ending codons were found as the OC in the low G + C% genomes (Table 2). In the three amino acids, the OCs were observed mostly from the family box codons and were less preferred from the split codon boxes. The observation with respect to the HTN and the LTN were similar for all the amino acids.We studied the OCs of these three amino acids in bacteria that were divided according to their phylogenetic groupings (Table 2). In case of Arg, the CGU and the CGC codons were largely selected as the OC across different bacteria. The other four synonymous codons were generally not observed as the OC; however, in some bacterial groups such as Spirochaetes, Firmicutes and <U+03F5>-Proteobacteria with low genome G + C%, AGA was also observed as the OC to some extent. It is pertinent to note that anticodons and its modifying enzymes used in bacteria to decode the Arg family box codons are different from the family box codons of the other amino acids.10 I34 in tR is used to decode the U/C/A-ending codons whereas C34 is used to decode the G-ending codon. It is important to note that though there is similarity between Arg and Gly with respect to the choice of the OC (Fig. 1b), there is a difference regarding modification in anticodons of tG and tR.In case of Leu, the choice of the OC in bacteria was found to be influenced by their phylogenetic affiliations. In case of <U+03B3>-Proteobacteria and ß-Proteobacteria which are more closely related phylogenetically in comparison to the Proteobacteria,48 CUG was selected as the OC, which is different from d-Proteobacteria and <U+03F5>-Proteobacteria. In case of Firmicutes, UUA, UUG and CUU were selected as the OCs. CUA was avoided as the OC in all the bacterial group. In case of <U+03B3>-Proteobacteria and ß-Proteobacteria, the tRNA gene copy number with C34 anticodon, which decodes the CUG codon, was higher than that in the other group of bacteria.40In case of Ser, the choice of OCs was found only from the four family box codons. OCs were found to be selected according to genome composition. For example, UCA and UCU were selected as OC in Firmicutes, Tenericutes (low G + C% genomes) whereas UCC and UCG were selected as OC in Actinobacteria, ß-Proteobacteria (high G + C% genomes). In case of <U+03F5>-Proteobacteria and Chlamydiae, low selection of OC was observed.Study of codon usage bias in different amino acids exhibited that there is amino acid specific influence for the selection of OCs in bacteria. For example, out of the six codons of Ser, the AGY codons were never selected as the OCs in any group of bacteria. Though the OCs were selected within the family box codons, the principle for the Leu and Ser that are encoded by six synonymous codons is different from the amino acids encoded by the four synonymous codons. This relationship between degeneracy of the codons and the principle of selection for the OCs in amino acids is surprising and interesting considering the fact that the set of anticodons used to decode the different family box codons as well as the anticodon modifying enzymes for family box tRNA is similar in a bacterium. Therefore, it is less likely that the above observation was a consequence of the anticodons.3.7. The abundance of most of the OCs is higher than the synonymous codons with same G + C composition in a genomeIt is known that genome G + C% strongly influences the abundance value of a synonymous codon in genomes.49–51 Two synonymous codons with the same G + C composition were available in case of amino acids encoded by 4- or 6-fold degeneracy codons. In the above section, we observed that out of the two synonymous codons with same G + C%, one of the codons was selected as the OC in many bacteria. This prompted us to compare the abundance values between two synonymous codons having the same G + C% and their selection as the OCs in genomes. Their abundance comparison in amino acids encoded by 4-fold degeneracy and 6-fold degeneracy codons was presented in Table 3. The results of the comparison between the C-ending and the G-ending codons in VH, H and M groups in the eight family boxes were presented. Comparison of the abundance values of the synonymous codons in bacteria with same G + C composition within family boxes*P value <0.05.**P value <0.01 (chi-square significant test; H0: G and C equal preference; HA: unequal preference between G and C).Comparison of the abundance values of the synonymous codons in bacteria with same G + C composition within family boxes*P value <0.05.**P value <0.01 (chi-square significant test; H0: G and C equal preference; HA: unequal preference between G and C).The C-ending codons were more abundant than the G-ending codons in case of Ala, Gly and Thr. In fact, the C-ending codons were the OCs in these amino acids. In case of Pro, the G-ending codon was more abundant than the C-ending codon, which was in concordance with the selection as the OC. However, in case of Val, the G-ending codon was more abundant than the C-ending codon, though the latter was selected as the OC. In the HTN and the LTN, the abundance patterns of the different amino acid codons were similar.In case of Arg, the abundance value of CGC was more than that of CGG. In fact, CGC was selected as the OC. In case of Leu, CUG abundance was higher than CUC. CUG was selected as the OC more often than CUC. In case of Ser, abundance values of the synonymous codons with the same G + C% were similar.It is often observed that the abundance values of the OCs are higher than the abundance values of the synonymous codons with the same G + C%. In some cases, variations were observed. The differential abundance values between two synonymous codons with the same G + C composition for an amino acid were following a uniform pattern across different bacteria. Why in some amino acids such as Val and Ser, abundance values of OCs is not higher than the other synonymous codons with same G + C composition is an interesting question.4. DiscussionThe earlier notion was that the extrinsic factors such as genome G + C%, tRNA gene numbers, etc., cause the difference in abundance values among the synonymous codons. The interesting point emerged in this study is the amino acid specific choice of OC in bacteria depending upon their phylogenetic affiliations, which is independent of their genome composition and tRNA gene number. For example, the observation of GAA as OC in ß-Proteobacteria and GAG as OC in the Spirochaetes in this study are the vindication of the influence of some bacterial phylogeny specific mechanisms influencing OC choice for Glu in these bacteria. Similarly, the observation of CUG as OCs in ß-Proteobacteria and <U+03B3>-Proteobacteria, that are phylogenetically closed than any other Proteobacteria also indicates a role of phylogeny specific mechanisms for OC choice in case of Leu in bacteria. The OCs for the three amino acids Gln, Glu and Lys, encoded only by the R-ending codons in split codon boxes were observed to be influenced maximally by the phylogeny of bacteria. The U34 of these tRNA undergoes different modifications to avoid frameshift mutation,52 correct decoding,53,54 to avoid miscoding of the non-synonymous codons of the amino acids of the split codon boxes,54,55 effective speed of decoding,12 during the translation. Our future research is aimed at doing a comparative study of the anticodon modifying enzymes across different phylogenetic groups of bacteria.The observation of the OCs limiting to only some synonymous codons for different amino acids across bacteria is interesting in this study. Why is this discrepancy among the codons? There are some known mechanisms such as frameshift mutation in case of GGG and CCC codon for which these codons are avoided as the OC in bacteria. But the reason is not known for some other non-OCs observed in this study such as CUA, CGR, G-ending codons of Ala, Val and Thr, and AGY. The findings in this study clearly indicate that the potential of all synonymous codons with regard to their selection as OCs in bacteria is not same even though they are encoding the same amino acid.There may be an influence of the preference and avoidance of dinucleotides during OC selection. The UA dinucleotide is not preferred in genomes,44,56 which might influence UUA, CUA, AUA and GUA for not being selected as the OC in any bacteria. Similarly for selection of CGU, GGU and UGU as the OCs, it may be argued that GU is the selected dinucleotide at the second codon position. Interestingly, the reverse complement of GU, AC are also observed to be preferred at the second position, as UAC, CAC are selected as the OCs in bacteria. Our finding on OCs is in concordance with the dinucleotide constraint on codon usage bias already reported in bacteria.44According to our present understanding, codon usage bias in organisms is a cumulative effect of the extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In the selection of the OCs in bacteria whether it is the extrinsic or the intrinsic factor that plays dominant role is not clear. We believe that the amino acid specific role for the selection of the OC in bacteria is decided first by the codon–anticodon interaction. The selection of the C-ending codons in case of amino acids encoded by the NNY codons is a suitable example. In these amino acids, only one anticodon is available to decode both the codons. So out of the two codon–anticodon interactions, the more stable one was selected in all the bacteria irrespective of genome composition. It is also not dependent upon the tRNA gene numbers.28 In case of the amino acids encoded by higher degeneracy codons, more than one codon can function as the OCs due to multiple codon–anticodon interactions. In this context, the increase in the copy number of the cognate tRNA complements the efficient translation of the OCs, which is required for bacterial adaptation to growth rate.15,16 It is not the tRNA gene copy number per se which may be essential for selection of the OC for an amino acid.28,57 Recently, it has been demonstrated that tRNA genes rapidly change in evolution to meet novel translational demands.58 It has also been observed that the copy number of only specific isoacceptor tRNA genes increased across bacteria.40 The role of anticodon modification enzymes and its effect on the selection of codons in different major taxa of life11,59 also supports our assumption that codon–anticodon interactions are important determinant factors for the selection of the OCs in bacteria. More research on codon–anticodon pairing during translation is likely to provide empirical evidence in favour of the role of codon–anticodon interaction on the selection of OCs. It is usually believed that mutation pressure maintains the abundance values of two synonymous codons with same G + C% similar in a genome. The consistently higher abundance value of one synonymous codon over the other synonymous codons with same G + C composition across bacteria further supports the contribution from the inherent nucleotide sequence of the triplet codon to its abundance in genomes.What is the evolutionary advantage or the selective force for having the amino acid specific principle for OC choice across bacteria? It is likely that the principle has enabled microorganisms to receive and express genes from the other microorganisms by lateral gene transfer. For example, both the U- and the C-ending codons of Gly are efficiently translated by the same anticodon.10 The translation rate of the gene inside the receptive host is less likely to be affected by the difference in codon usage bias. Now the well-known phenomenon of co-translational protein folding60 and the kinetics of translation is important for the structure and function of a protein.26 Thus, lateral gene transfer may also get inhibited due to the differential translational kinetics of a gene across different bacteria.61,62 A recent study has revealed that OC choice between the two archaea groups, Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea, is different for many amino acids,63 unlike what we observed for bacteria in this study. As bacteria are evolutionarily different from archaea, the selection force on codon usage bias between the two groups of archaea may not be the same. Similarly in human, which is phylogenetically very different from bacteria and archaea, there is no difference between the high and the low expression genes with respect to codon usage bias.64A recent publication by Babbitt et al. (2014)65 discusses intrinsic DNA flexibility and codon usage bias across different bacteria, which is also in support of the analysis discussed in this paper. In conclusion, our study indicates a vital role of the nucleotide sequence of the triplet in selection as OCs in bacteria that was proposed three decades ago by Thomas et al. (1988).66We are very much thankful to the two anonymous reviewers for their comments which helped us to improve the manuscript in different ways and to analyse the data differents.

IntroductionGrapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the world’s most important fruit crops and has been an integral part of human history since it was domesticated 6,000–8,000 yrs ago.1 Grapes provide a vast number of metabolites with well-known health attributes, and the importance of these metabolites for the human diet underlines the importance of understanding their genetic and physiological basis. The sequence of the grapevine genome2 offered several lines of evidence for expanding gene families related to wine quality and health attributes. Among these, there is an over-representation of genes involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as the stilbene (anticarcinogenesis) synthase family.3,4 Genes related to flavonoid synthesis (nutraceuticals) are also highly duplicated in Vitis, including the R2R3-MYB family of transcription factors (TFs),5 which regulates various aspects of plant metabolism and development.The R2R3-MYB family was expanded by massive duplication events within plants.6,7 Genome-wide analyses on eudicotyledonous species show that this family has between 70 and 200 members.6 The main amplification of this TF family may have occurred before the separation of monocots and eudicots,8 although some species underwent later duplications associated with their polyploid genome origins (e.g. maize, rice and grapevine2,8). In addition to these expansion and diversification episodes, tandem duplication of subgroups have also been predicted,5,9–11 many of which could have been fixed during the course of domestication.The first accession of the grapevine genome (×8.4) allowed the identification of 108 genes in the R2R3-MYB family,5 although these genes were not assigned to any particular nomenclature. Despite its size, less than 10% of the members of this family have been functionally characterized. With the exception of VviMYB60 (regulating stomata aperture12) and VviMYB80 (controlling stamen development,13 all other R2R3-MYBs characterized to date are involved in regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway. These include activators of the anthocyanin,14,15 flavonoid,16–18 proanthocyanidin (PA)19 and stilbene20 pathways, and also members of the C2-repressor motif clade.18,21To determine the processes in which other members of the R2R3-MYB family are involved, several network inference approaches can be used to predict gene function and prioritize candidate genes for subsequent characterization (e.g. using reverse genetic tools). Three main network inference methods have been adopted to infer gene function in crop species22: (i) transfer of network links between evolutionarily conserved genes (associalogs); (ii) genome context similarities (phylogenetic and gene neighbourhood profiling) and (iii) analysis of gene co-expression networks (GCN). GCNs are based on the ‘guilt-by-association’ principle, where genes involved in biologically related pathways/processes exhibit comparable expression dynamics across a wide range of experimental conditions. GCNs provide a comprehensive overview of gene–gene relationships across multiple experimental conditions (condition-independent GCN) or in determined conditions (condition-specific GCN, e.g. abiotic stress only)23 in both conserved and species-specific pathways.24 In addition, analysis of cis-regulatory elements/motifs (CRE) in GCN, linking CRE to co-expressed genes and to genes of given biological processes, has also been used to better understand plant transcriptional control.25,26In this study, we propose a revised classification of the grapevine R2R3-MYB family and use omics data to correct gene annotations and study duplications and diversification processes within the family. We used microarray and RNA-Seq data to understand the regulation of expression and alternative splicing. We constructed a global GCN from publicly available data, encompassing a vast collection of tissue/developmental and stress-related conditions. Identification of tightly interconnected relationships was coupled to cis-regulatory motif enrichment analysis, carried out in 1 kb upstream regions of all co-expressed genes. These combined analyses allowed us to identify orthologues of known genes, to discover new genes involved in regulating metabolic routes and to suggest common and unique biological roles for members of this family.2. Materials and methods2.1. Model corrections in the grapevine R2R3-MYB family and search of new annotations within the genomeA consensus sequence of the DNA-binding domain (106 residues5) was used to run a search of all putative R2R3 MYB genes in the 12Xv1 genome prediction (http://genomes.cribi.unipd.it/). The BLASTP and PSI-BLAST suites were used to perform similarity searches in the predicted proteome database. Obtained models were compared to the genes found in Matus et al. (2008)5 and Wilkins et al. (2009).27 Annotated protein sequences were tested for the presence of R2 and R3 repeats using a locally run RPS-BLAST on the Conserved Domain Database (CDD)28 and a profile Hidden Markov model (HMM) scan from the HMMER suite on the Pfam-A database.29,30 Annotations were then aligned and compared with previously published RNA-Seq data31,32 and with a de novo assembled grapevine transcriptome (Wong et al., unpublished), using the pairwise or multiple (CLUSTALW2, CLUSTAL OMEGA or MUSCLE) sequence alignment tools available at EMBL-EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/).2.2. Phylogeny reconstructions and identification of conserved protein motifsDeduced grapevine proteins were aligned against the full predicted amino acid sequences of proteins belonging to the entire Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3 MYB-family (126 members). Arabidopsis maMYB, an endoplasmic reticulum-anchored R2R3-MYB TF was used as out-group. Multiple sequence alignments (gap open penalty of -2.9) were performed using the MUSCLE algorithm-based AlignX module from MEGA5 software.33 Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods [NJ was computed using the no-differences model, ML was computed using the Whelan and Goldman model with Gamma distributed (G + I) rates among sites], both with partial deletion gap treatments. Reliability of tree nodes was evaluated with 1000 bootstraps. Resulting trees were visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree). MYB subgroups were defined both by bootstrap values and by the presence of C-terminal motifs as identified in multiple EM for motif elicitation suite. Protein sequences (excluding DNA binding domains) of R2R3-MYB subgroups were used to discover motifs with an expected value lower than 2 × 10-30 (http://meme.nbcr.net/), using different search parameters: (i) mucilage and acidification of vacuoles ‘MAV’ subgroup: 6–13 residues (min–max length), zero or one occurrence per sequence of motifs and four motifs maximum, (ii) MYBPA1-related subgroup ‘PA1’: 6–12 residues (min–max length), zero or one occurrence per sequence and four motifs maximum, (iii): S2Neighbour ‘S2N’: 6–9 residues (min–max length), zero or one occurrence per sequence and four motifs maximum.2.3. Genome structure and duplication analysisChromosomal positions and amino acid sequences for all (29,971) protein-coding genes were retrieved from the 12Xv1 prediction of the grapevine genome (http://genomes.cribi.unipd.it/grape/). Identification of gene duplication patterns were carried out using the MCScanX software suite.34 Briefly, self-genome all-vs-all BLASTP analysis was first performed according to the recommended settings of MCScanX using NCBI-BLAST-2.2.30+.35 MCScanX assigns the various types of duplication event (dispersed, proximal, tandem and segmental) to all the R2R3 MYB genes based on chromosomal positions and the blast alignments.2.4. Expression data and gene co-expression network constructionPublicly available 29K NimbleGen Whole-genome array data from 14 experiments representing 664 arrays were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus.36 Raw intensity data were background-adjusted and summarized with the Robust Multi-Array method using oligo37 and averaged according to the biological replicates. The resulting expression matrix (219 arrays × 29,000 genes) was used to construct a global highest reciprocal rank (HRR) network.24 HRR for all genes were calculated in R (http://www.r-project.org), by first considering the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) (r) value between all gene pairs and subsequently ranking them according to the formula; HRR (x, y) = [max(rank(x, y), rank(x, y))], whereby rank(x, y) is the transformed rank of gene y according to gene x’s co-expression list and vice versa for rank(y, x). Using a ‘bottom-up’ (targeted) approach, individual MYB-co-expressed gene (MYB-coex) sub-network was constructed by extracting the co-expressed genes within the top 100 HRRs. The MYB-TF gene (MYB-MYB) sub-network was constructed by merging all the individual MYB-co-ex sub-networks and retaining only the MYB genes and their respective co-expression relationships. Visualization of the various sub-networks was carried out in Cytoscape version 3.0.382.5. Over-representation analysis of gene function and promoter regionsFunctional annotation and MapMan BINs assignment of transcripts based on the 12Xv1 prediction were performed using Mercator.39 Significant enrichment of MapMan BIN categories (Adj. P value < 0.05) within MYB co-expressed genes was determined by Fisher’s exact test adjusted with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing corrections. For comparison, enrichment (False discovery rate < 0.05) of gene ontology (GO) terms based on incremental enrichment analysis was performed using gProfileR.40Using the 12Xv1 assembly, a 1 kb region upstream of the transcriptional start site of all predicted genes (29,971) was retrieved by the Biomart tool available at EnsemblPlants (http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html). Promoter sequences containing more than 10% of ambiguous sequences (indicated as ‘N’) were removed, resulting in a total of 29,839 promoter sequences. A comprehensive and up-to-date list of plant TF binding sites were scanned in promoter regions of MYB-co-expressed genes and the promoter background (29,839 promoters). These sites were inferred from: (i) protein-binding microarrays, representing 76 CRE from 25 TF families,41 (ii) a selection of consensus sequences from ‘Plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements database’ (PLACE)42 (50 in total; representing organ-specific and endogenous/environmental/signalling TF binding sites) and (iii) 17 functionally validated R2R3-MYB binding sites (consensus and variant).43–45 Enrichment for CRE, expressed as P value (or -log10(P value)*10), was based on the hypergeometric test according to Ma et al.25 using a custom-made pipeline in R (http://www.r-project.org).2.6. Expression analysis of VviMYB13, VviMYB14 and VviMYB15 by quantitative RT-PCRNon-stressed grapevine organs (young and old leaves, stems and roots from cv. Chardonnay and cv. Shiraz) and berries from a developmental series (cv. Pinot Noir and cv. Riesling) were collected from a greenhouse and a commercial vineyard, respectively, in Neustadt/W, Germany (49° 22' 9"" south, 8° 10' 28"" east). Sampling methods, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR reactions were conducted as previously described.20 Leaf discs from greenhouse-grown V. vinifera cv. Shiraz plants were subjected to different biotic and abiotic stresses: wounding, UV-C irradiation and downy mildew infection, as described by Vannozzi et al.4 Leaf discs of 15 mm of diameter were punched from healthy leaves. The punching of discs was considered as a wounding treatment per se, and as a control for other treatments. The UV-C treatment was achieved by exposing the abaxial surface of the discs to 30W UV-C light for 10 min at a distance of 10 cm. Downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) infection was carried out by spraying a solution containing downy mildew sporangia at a concentration of 105 sporangia ml-1. Stressed discs were incubated upside down on moist filter paper in large Petri dishes at 22 °C under 12 h light/12 h dark conditions until sampling (dried with absorbent paper and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA extraction).Expression of grape MYB genes from Subgroup 2 was determined using primers MYB13_CDS_qF5'-CGTTTTCATCAGAGCTGGAGG, MYB13_3'UTR_qR 5'-TCCCTGTATGATCTCCCCTCT, MYB15_3'UTR_qF 5'-CATTGACCAAGAAAGCAAAAA and MYB15_3'UTR_qR 5'-AGCAACTTTTCCTAAGTCAATTTC. MYB14 was amplified with primers described in Holl et al.20 The cycle threshold values were corrected to VviUBIQUITIN1 (TC32075), VviEF1-a (EC959059) and VviGAPDH (CB973647). Normalization against reference genes was conducted as described previously.462.7. Analysis of stilbenes in grapevine organsStilbenes were extracted from 50 mg of non-stressed sampled organs. Extraction was done in methanol and measured by reverse-phase High performance liquid chromatography as previously described by Höll et al.20 Quantification of the glycosylated-resveratrol, piceid, was calculated from calibration curves prepared from commercial stilbene standard trans-piceid (PhytoLab GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). Concentrations were calculated as nmol/g FW with error bars indicating the standard error from three biological replicates and two independent experiments.3. Results and discussion3.1. Novel genes and subgroups in the grapevine R2R3-MYB family: updated nomenclatureThe first survey of R2R3-MYB family members in grapevine identified 108 genes in the ×8.4 genome draft sequence.5 Subsequent studies reported increased and contradictory numbers of members,27,47 urging the need to define the true size of this family in the latest genome accession. Here, by inspecting MYB R2R3 DNA-binding signatures (using BLAST-coupled to-HMMER analysis) in the CRIBI 12Xv1 genome accession, we retrieved a total number of 134 sequences (Supplementary Table S1). We compared these to the VCOST gene predictions (annotated on the 12Xv2 of the genome assembly) and uploaded to the Online Resource for Community Annotation of Eukaryotes database (ORCAE, http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/) as part of the grapevine genome curation effort.We curated gene models by comparing gene structures with known R2R3-MYB genes and by using RNA-Seq data, which also validated the expression of these annotations (Supplementary Dataset 1). The search for mRNA sequences in comprehensive RNA-Seq datasets of V. vinifera31,32 (and Wong et al., unpublished) allowed us to overcome annotation errors due to the constraints of the ab initio prediction algorithm. Inspection of these sequences supported the existence 196 transcribed units, including several splicing forms, for a total of 115 MYB genes (Supplementary Table S1). The use of RNA-Seq data has largely been effective for improving gene family characterizations.48,49 Here, we corrected several models in terms of the length and presence of their DNA-binding and/or C-terminal domains (Supplementary Dataset 1), such as MYB135 (VIT_14s0036g00460), where the RNA-Seq data showed that the gene encodes an integral R3 repeat and a larger C-terminal domain, or MYB82A (VIT_11s0016g05650) and MYB186 (VIT_13s0064g00960), corrected in the complete extension of their DNA binding domains. The MYB13 (VIT_05s0049g01010) gene possesses three exons instead of four (in the 12Xv1 model a portion of the third exon was mistakenly predicted to be an intron). Aside of the 134 genes, we were able to amend two incorrectly annotated R2R3-MYB genes, which actually correspond to R1R2R3R4-MYB genes (VIT_17s0000g02730 and VIT_16s0039g01750). The model VIT_02s0025g02210, which we originally identified,5 was not found in this re-analysis, as conserved domains were no longer present (NCBI Conserved Domain Database).A small fraction of the models identified (e.g. those not found in RNA-Seq data) may represent pseudogenes that have lost their expression or protein-coding ability. This is the case of MYBA4 (VIT_02s0033g00370), which lacks part of the DNA binding domain due to a frameshift mutation. MYBA4 is located in a cluster of MYB genes in chromosome 2 (chr2), next to the berry colour locus, but it has no expression.15 It may have arisen from a tandem duplication of MYBA1 or MYBA2, which are true regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the berry.14,15 In addition to MYBA4, other predictions from the same chr2 cluster could represent pseudogenes, particularly MYBA8 (VIT_02s0033g00380), which it is expressed (corroborated by RNA-Seq data) but has an incomplete DNA-binding domain (63 residues, Supplementary Dataset 1).We generated phylogenetic trees of the grape and Arabidopsis R2R3-MYB families using the confirmed or modified full-predicted proteins derived from the RNA-Seq data (Supplementary Fig. S1). Where no data were available to confirm the model, we used the annotated sequence from the Pinot Noir reference genome (CRIBI annotation). Grape proteins with a complete R2R3 domain (excluding MYBA4 and MYBA8) were compared with 126 Arabidopsis proteins to assess cases of one-to-one orthology. As in our previous work,5 we observed an expansion of subgroups related to phenylpropanoid/flavonoid biosynthesis (e.g. anthocyanin and PA). These subgroups are either activators (Subgroups 5 and 6) or repressors (Subgroup 4, also known as C2 repressor clade) of the pathway. Grape genotypes with expanded MYB genes related to flavonoid synthesis may have been selected during grapevine natural selection and also later throughout domestication. However, this may have resulted from branch-specific selections, since not all flavonoid-related groups are expanded. For example, while Arabidopsis has three members in flavonol-related Subgroup 7, grapevine has only two, which may be because grapes synthesize other molecules related to biotic and abiotic stress in addition to flavonols such as stilbenes, which are not present in Arabidopsis.Based on our comparison of phylogenetic trees and according to the guidelines from the Super-Nomenclature Committee for Grape Gene Annotation,50 we propose a nomenclature for the grapevine R2R3-MYB family based on sequence similarities with the Arabidopsis genes (retaining the same name in cases of close orthology), but also maintaining the original names for R2R3-MYB TFs that have already been characterized (e.g. MYBA and MYBPA for all anthocyanin and PA-related genes, respectively). Genes with no clear orthology with a single Arabidopsis MYB member were named MYBx, where x is a consecutive number starting from 135 (Supplementary Table S1). Genes at the same phylogenetic distance from a single Arabidopsis gene were differentiated by a letter, as in the case of MYB5A and MYB5B. Additional genes identified in future re-annotations or novel genes arising in specific cultivars should be numbered from MYB197 onwards.We compared the MYB subgroups found in the grapevine to those previously described in Arabidopsis.45,51 We also compared the grapevine/Arabidopsis MYB tree with other trees obtained by combining Arabidopsis (individually) with the apple, tomato, poplar and Eucalyptus families (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S2). We generally observed conserved topologies, except for the glucosinolate clade (Subgroup 12, present in Arabidopsis but absent in the other species analysed), which regulates the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites found exclusively in the Brassicaceae family.52 We observed some differences in subgroup composition with respect to other plant species (i.e. number of members). Some subgroups were larger in some species than in Arabidopsis, such as Subgroups 5 and 14, while in others they were smaller (e.g. Subgroup 19).Phylogenetic comparison showed that AtMYB5 homologues cluster in a different clade than AtMYB123 homologues, in contrast to previous works who generally group them in Subgroup 5.45,51 We named this independent Subgroup ‘MAV’ in reference to the roles of AtMYB5,53 PhPH454 and VviMYB5A/5B.18 We also identified several subgroups that were missing in Arabidopsis and present in other plant species, including the flavonoid-related PA1 and the S2 neighbour (S2N) Subgroups, which correspond to the woody preferential groups WPS-II and WPS-IV/V in Eucalyptus, respectively.47 The PA1 subgroup is the closest to MAV, and VviMYBPA1 is its only characterized member.19 Protein motif discovery analyses showed that this group has two conserved motifs (PA1-1 and PA1-2) that are not shared with the MAV Subgroup (Supplementary Fig. S3). The S2N Subgroup shows a close relationship to Subgroup 2 due to high conservation of the DNA-binding domain. Moreover, S2N is divided into two clades, where S2Na presents one of the two phenylalanine-tryptophan (FW) conserved motifs found in Subgroup 2 (both form part of a single motif).51 Despite not having an FW motif, MYB135 lies very close to Subgroup 2 because of greater conservation in the DNA-binding domain.3.2. Tandem duplications specifically contributed to the expansion of many grape R2R3-MYB genes linked to wine quality traitsWe successfully mapped a total of 131 grapevine R2R3-MYB genes to the 19 V. vinifera chromosomes; while MYBPAL1, MYB190 and MYB148 are still unallocated (uncharacterized chromosome). The locations of these genes are visualized in the chromosome based on the 12Xv1 assembly (Fig. 1) . We used MCScanX software to further determine the duplication types that might have given rise to the expansion of this large gene family, and found that segmental (36.7%; 50 of 134) and dispersed (36.7%; 50 of 134) duplications appear to be the most prominent contributors (Supplementary Table S1). Many segmental and dispersed duplicated MYBs are located in collinear regions on chr1/14/17 (green), chr6/8/13 (orange) and chr5/7 (pink) (Fig. 1). A recent study showed that syntenic regions of related chromosomes in land plants such as maize, tomato, Arabidopsis and poplar, have large proportions of R2R3-MYB paralogue correspondence (25%, 49%, 48% and 38%, respectively).6 This reinforces the idea that R2R3-MYB expansion in land plants, including grapevine (37%, reported here), primarily occurs through segmental duplication. In addition, dispersed duplications, defined as paralogues that do not share synteny and/or are not in close proximity in the corresponding chromosome, may also contribute to expansion of gene families in plants.55Distribution of R2R3-MYB genes in the grapevine chromosomes. Paralogue regions of the grapevine genome were coloured according to Jaillon et al.2 Genes predicted to arise from dispersed, proximal, tandem or segmental duplications are shown. Details related to potential paralogues generated by tandem duplication or collinear pairs within syntenic regions are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Distribution of R2R3-MYB genes in the grapevine chromosomes. Paralogue regions of the grapevine genome were coloured according to Jaillon et al.2 Genes predicted to arise from dispersed, proximal, tandem or segmental duplications are shown. Details related to potential paralogues generated by tandem duplication or collinear pairs within syntenic regions are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. We observed a strong influence of dispersed mechanisms on R2R3-MYB expansion (37%), in concordance with wide-spread repetitive/transposable elements within the grapevine genome (approximately 40% of the total genome).2 Indeed, many of these elements have been linked to grapevine’s genomic variability.56 Tandem duplication (21.3%; 29 of 134) also contributed to family expansion (Fig. 1). We observed a dense map of MYB genes in tandem on chromosomes 2, 4 and 11, such as for MYBA (9 out of 14 genes) and MYBPA (5 out of 15 genes). Expansion of R2R3-MYB families related to anthocyanin and PA synthesis have been related to artificial selection (i.e. breeding), possibly because of higher flavonoid concentration in grapes and wines.5 In addition, our analysis also revealed that tandem duplication might have contributed to the expansion of the C2-repressor clade, albeit on a smaller scale. Expansion of this subgroup might also be linked to selection for wine quality traits, as recent studies show that MYB C2-repressors have a central role in regulating the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways.18,21 C2-repressors may go through transcriptional sub-specialization after duplication, as suggested for grapevine18 and other species such as clover, where a high concentration of flavonoids is also a desirable trait.57 Finally, we assigned expansion by proximal duplication to 7 of 134 genes (5.14%), although these might also be part of tandem duplications.Gene duplications related to segmental and tandem duplications reported here are consistent with the results of a survey of segmental and tandem duplications of R2R3-MYB genes across land plants,6 with minor differences attributable to the updated/improved annotation of Vitis family. These duplication patterns indicated that rapid expansion of R2R3-MYB genes in grapevine might be strongly linked to adaptation strategies to challenging environments in order to accomplish species-specific functions.3.3. Intron retention as a conserved mechanism of alternative splicing in the grape R2R3-MYB familyAlternative splicing is a tightly regulated mechanism that contributes to proteome diversity, and can be studied using transcriptomic approaches. In grapevine, the NimbleGen microarray platform does not assay splice variants, and the Affymetrix system detects only some mRNA alternative isoforms (with differences between the 16 k and custom arrays). Deep sequencing can overcome these limitations by providing details of all splice forms. Inspection of the RNA-Seq data used in this study, which comes from a vast collection of tissues, organs and stages of berry development, allowed us to detect more than two mRNA isoforms for ~35% of the family, of which a quarter of cases were represented by three or more splice forms (Supplementary Dataset 1). These results are consistent with estimates of overall alternative splicing events in Vitis.58 The most common type of splicing event we observed (>90%) was intron retention, generating premature termination codons. We observed a relatively similar distribution of retention for introns 1 and 2, although the latter was more common in some subgroups (e.g. Subgroup 4; Supplementary Fig. S4). Since the DNA-binding domain of grape R2R3-MYB genes is generally split between Exons E1, E2 and E3 (for class I) or E1 and E2 (for classes II and III),5 the truncated protein sequences derived from intron-retaining isoforms have partial DNA-binding domains (e.g. MYB-like, with one of the two R repeats) and incomplete or abolished C-terminal regions. We observed few cases of exon skipping, such as MYB147 (VIT_17s0000g09080), where its alternative spliced isoform (MYB147.2) lacks half of the R2 repeat but maintains the R3 repeat and its C-terminal region (Supplementary Dataset 1).Intron retention accounts for a large proportion of alternative splicing events in Arabidopsis, rice and grapevine, and can generate relatively abundant isoforms with premature termination codons.58,59 We observed three spliced isoforms of the stilbene-related MYB15 gene (VIT_05s0049g01020; Supplementary Dataset 1). The retention of intron 2 in MYB15.2 generates two potential open reading frames (ORFs), each encoding only a segment of the complete MYB15 protein (ORF1 encodes R2 and part of R3, while ORF2 encodes the rest of the protein). In contrast, MYB15.3 retains intron 1 and encodes a single R2 protein without any C-terminal region. As reported by Li et al.60, AtMYB59 and AtMYB48 undergo alternative splicing and generate MYB-like transcripts whose 5' untranslated regions (UTR) are insufficient to initiate translation. Further studies will determine if truncated isoforms of VviMYB15 can be translated and if those proteins have a regulatory role in stilbene biosynthesis.Transcription and its regulation are two processes with high-energy demands. Alternative splicing should, therefore, be a precisely regulated event since the production of futile products can be detrimental to plant fitness. This comes in part from the observation that alternative splicing is widespread in plants and plays an important role in regulating gene expression (reviewed by Staiger and Brown61). VviMYB24 (VIT_14s0066g01090) is an interesting case as its long intron 2 (2.9 kb) is retained in one of the two mRNA isoforms. This gene has a tissue-specific expression in reproductive organs,5 and is highly induced by UV-B in ripening berries.62 Thus, alternative splicing of its intron 2 may be important for its regulation.3.4. Expression modules potentially regulated by grapevine R2R3-MYBs are primarily enriched with transcription factors and secondary metabolic pathway genesGCN analysis is not yet as widely adopted in crop species as in model plants. In grapevine, very few studies have adopted these approaches. Candidate genes involved in regulating the accumulation of anthocyanin63 and organic acid64 in the berry have been prioritized based on a previous GCN resource developed by Wong et al.65 Another study constructed a berry-specific GCN that prioritized master regulators of phase transition in berry ripening.66 To reliably predict the function and potential downstream targets of grapevine R2R3-MYB TFs, we constructed an MYB GCN using measures of HRR. Rank of correlations generates more robust results24,67 than correlation-based metrics, such as the PCC. We performed a new analysis increasing the number of dataset considered (15 experiments, 219 conditions averaged from 664 NimbleGen arrays; Supplementary Table S3), and obtained better representation of development and stress than the current Vitis Co-expression database (VTCdb, 480 NimbleGen arrays, eight experiments).65 Among the additional experiments considered, we included transcriptional studies of berry circadian oscillation and day/night transcriptional program, berry response to Botrytis cinerea infection, heat, UV-B and drought/water-deficit stress (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, Supplementary Fig. S5). To assess MYB co-expression, we chose the top 100 HRR-ranked co-expressed genes for 132 grape R2R3-MYBs (excluding MYBA4 and MYBA8; Supplementary Table S5). This threshold provided a reasonable limit for further functional studies and a manageable list of co-expressed genes while providing statistical power for inferring co-expression relationships.23,68Initial inspection of the exclusive MYB-MYB GCNs showed a strong correlation between 102 annotated MYB gene pairs. Seventy-nine genes and 127 edges formed a central cluster while a second cluster contained 11 MYB genes connected by 35 edges (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S5). The fact that a large proportion of MYB genes are reciprocally correlated suggests different types of relations: (i) role redundancy, (ii) partnership in the regulatory mechanisms and (iii) shared response or signalling pathways, in which an MYB may mediate neighbouring MYB-expression (i.e. acting as orchestrator). Within the central cluster, two hub-like regions were prevalent (top 5% of highest degree nodes; node degree > 6). Genes such as MYB152 (VIT_18s0001g08470) and MYB166 (VIT_04s0044g01380) showed a high degree of relationship in hub 1, while MYBPAR (VIT_11s0016g01300) and MYBC2-L4 (VIT_17s0000g02650) represent high-degree of relationship in hub 2. MYBA genes predominate in a smaller second cluster in addition to MYB13 (VIT_05s0049g01010) and MYB15 (VIT_05s0049g01020) from Subgroup 2, and MYB108B (VIT_07s0005g01950) from Subgroup 20. Surprisingly, five MYBA genes (MYBA5, MYBA6, MYBA7, MYBAL1 and MYBAL2) from the expanded anthocyanin subclade (Subgroup 6, Supplementary Fig. S1) were not connected to the main MYBA cluster within the MYB-MYB GCN. This is due to clear divergence among these genes in expression patterns across various tissues/organs and stress conditions (Supplementary Table S4), which may indicate sub- and/or neo- functionalization after duplication, as commonly observed in regulatory genes from Arabidopsis.69 Despite this diversification in expression, the group of MYBA5, MYBA6 and MYBA7 genes located in chr14, is indeed related to the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis (Matus et al., unpublished results). The MYB-MYB GCN based on the top 100 HRR. Nodes represent genes and edges indicate significant co-expressions between R2R3-MYB genes. The coloured nodes indicate the degree of connections of each node with its neighbours (red/dark indicates a degree = 5, white indicates a degree of 4 and blue/light grey indicates a degree = 3).The MYB-MYB GCN based on the top 100 HRR. Nodes represent genes and edges indicate significant co-expressions between R2R3-MYB genes. The coloured nodes indicate the degree of connections of each node with its neighbours (red/dark indicates a degree = 5, white indicates a degree of 4 and blue/light grey indicates a degree = 3).To determine the biological processes that each R2R3-MYB gene might be involved in, we performed over-representation analysis of the MapMan BIN terms70 for the top 100 co-expressed genes of all MYB GCNs (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Table S6). This analysis revealed that RNA regulation (BIN27) was the most commonly enriched term (Adj. P value < 0.05, for 57 out of the 130 MYB networks), suggesting that R2R3-MYBs may orchestrate plant responses by regulating or interacting with proteins related to transcription, RNA stability, etc. Terms related to metabolism, especially secondary metabolism (BIN16), hormone metabolism (BIN17) and stress (BIN20) were also commonly presented in the top 100 co-expressed genes. Processes related to the cell wall (BIN10), lipid (BIN11) and photosynthesis (BIN1) were also represented, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Table S6). Among the most commonly associated ‘regulation by RNA’ BIN term, 35 MYB GCNs were also enriched with ‘MYB domain TF family’ (BIN27.3.25), followed by ‘secondary metabolism’ (BIN16) with 44 MYB GCNs (Supplementary Table S6). Among secondary metabolic pathways, the most enriched terms were related to phenylpropanoid derivatives and terpenes (Supplementary Fig. S6). We conducted GO enrichment analysis using the R ‘gProfileR’ package and found similar results to the MapMan analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7; Supplementary Table S7). Together, these results highlight that R2R3-MYB TFs primarily participate in secondary metabolic processes and in transcriptome modulation.

Grapevine MYBA1-A2 regulate anthocyanin accumulation by modulating UDP-GLUCOSE:FLAVONOID 3-O-GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE (UFGT) expression.13 We were able to associate eight MYBA genes (MYBA1, MYBA2, MYBA3, MYBA7, MYBA9, MYBA10, MYBA11 and MYBA12) and four additional MYB TFs (MYB108B, MYB15, MYBPA10 and MYB142) with anthocyanin-related genes. For example, MYBA1-2 were co-expressed with UFGT (VIT_16s0039g02230) while MYB108B was co-expressed with ANTHOCYANIN GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE 4 (GST4, VIT_04s0079g00690), the gene involved in anthocyanin transport into vacuoles.71 In addition, MYB15 was associated with anthocyanin pathway through co-expression with several MYBA genes. As MYB15 has only been related to the stilbene pathway,18 this observation suggests that MYB15 and MYBA genes are induced by similar conditions (e.g. stress) and not necessarily involved in regulating the same branch of the pathway. On the other hand, MYB30A, which was not co-expressed with a large set of anthocyanin-related genes, is co-expressed with ANTHOCYANIN O-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 and 2 (AOMT1-2, VIT_01s0010g03510 and VIT_01s0010g03490), the genes responsible for anthocyanin methylation.72The robustness of the networks generated was also evident from inspecting regulators of the PA pathway. MYBPA1, a positive regulator of PA biosynthesis in grapevine,19 was co-expressed with structural genes of the flavonoid pathway, including a FLAVONOID 3',5'-HYDROXYLASE (VIT_08s0007g05160), a LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE (VIT_01s0011g02960) and a ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE (ANR, VIT_00s0361g00040), which corroborates the activation of PA-flavonoid pathway gene promoters seen by Bogs et al.19 The role of MYBPAR73 was corroborated by its co-expression with ANR, a co-expressed target shared also with MYBPA1. In the case of MYBPA274 co-expression list, we found a grape homologue of the Petunia AN11 gene (VIT_08s0007g02920). This gene was recently proposed as candidate for the regulation of flavonoid synthesis in the grape berry skin.63We also tested additional biochemical pathways of biotechnological interest for association with R2R3-MYB proteins. For example, six MYB GCNs (those of MYB26, MYB103, MYB185, MYB186, MYB190 and MYB191) were enriched with terms related to lignification/secondary cell wall formation (Supplementary Fig. S8, Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). These six MYB GCNs have two genes in common, a cellulose biogenesis-related gene (COBRA, VIT_17s0000g05060) and an NAC secondary wall thickening-promoting factor (NST1, VIT_02s0025g02710). Arabidopsis homologues of these genes have been shown to be part of a large suite of secondary cell wall regulators (e.g. MYBs) and master switches (e.g. NST1).75,76 This supports the robustness of our GCN and points to the existence of a comparable transcriptional network in grapevine. Terms related to wax metabolism were significantly enriched in six MYB GCNs, suggesting that R2R3-MYB TFs are also involved in this pathway (e.g. by regulating plant cuticle-structural genes). This may be relevant for grapevine MIXTA-like MYBs, VviMYB140 and VviMYB17A, as MIXTA-like TFs regulate both epidermal cell morphology and the biosynthesis of waxes, very long-chain fatty acids and cutins in Arabidopsis and crown violets.77 Interestingly, MYBA5 and MYBAL2 GCNs were enriched with terms related to wax metabolism and anthocyanin metabolism, which supports sub-/neo-functionalization, as described earlier (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7).Inspection of TF families in MYB-GCNs showed that, in addition to members of the same R2R3-MYB family, there was a strong representation of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH, 126 occurrences) and APETALA2/ethylene-responsive binding protein (AP2/EREBP, 95 occurrences) families (Fig. 3C). Protein–protein interaction and cross-regulation is common between MYB and bHLH TFs. For instance, MYB-bHLH protein complexes are essential for regulating epidermal cell fate, including flavonoid synthesis,78 trichome development79 and also in flower and seed development.80 In grapevine, several studies using LUCIFERASE reporters have demonstrated that the activation of flavonoid structural genes only occurs when MYB and bHLH TFs are co-transformed.15,17,19 In addition to the well-known MYB-bHLH interactions, a recent study provided evidence of a new transcriptional complex of AP2/EREBP-R2R3-MYB proteins involved in regulating lignification.81 These examples support the frequent co-expression of R2R3-MYBs with other TF families such as bHLH and AP2/EREBP.3.5. Analysis of cis-regulatory elements in promoter regions of R2R3-MYB co-expressed genes supports coordinated regulation with other transcription factors, defines DNA-binding specificity and prioritizes co-expressed target genesIn an attempt to resolve how the presence of CRE affect the transcriptional control of biological processes, several studies have coupled enrichment of regulatory motifs in promoters of co-expressed genes with enrichment of gene function.25,26 We scanned the promoters of MYB co-expressed genes using a comprehensive and up-to-date plant CRE list (See Materials and methods). Our results provide some clues to explain the observed co-regulation of different TF families within the MYB GCNs (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S9; Supplementary Table S8). The observed enrichment (at P value < 0.01) of several CREs such as bHLH (MYC2-, 3- and 4-), homeobox (WUS), zinc finger (C2H2) and AP2/EREBP binding sites generally coincided with the prevalence of associated TF co-regulation within each MYB GCN (Fig. 3C). This indicates that TFs from other families may coordinate biological responses via a synchronic and cooperative mechanism together with MYB proteins, as previously shown for some characterized MYB TFs.78,80,81To dissect the organization of CRE motifs in the promoter regions of co-expressed genes, we considered three main MYB binding types (type I—CNGTTR-, II—TNGTTR- and IIG/AC-elements—CCWAMC-),43,44 as well as several other reported variants45 (Fig. 4). Some motifs were more prevalent in the promoters of co-expressed genes, such as CAGTTR (x˜: 52) for type I, TTGTTR (x˜: 84) for type II, CCAACC (x˜: 38) for type IIG/AC-elements, and AGGTTA (x˜: 47) for MYB variants (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Tables S9 and S10). In addition, we observed that the number of MYB GCNs enriched with these motifs was generally between 7 and 20, with a P value < 0.01 (Fig. 4B). Deviations in the number of MYB enriched GCNs with each CRE (P < 0.01) were prominent for types ‘I’ (17 for CAGTTR versus 4 for CTGTTR) or ‘IIG/AC-element’ (19 for CCAACC versus 6 for CCTACC), which may reflect the general preference for binding specificity within each class. Considering these binding motifs as a complete set, 72 MYB GCNs were enriched (P < 0.01) with at least one main MYB consensus group, with type IIG/AC-elements generally being the most over-represented (39 MYB enriched GCNs), followed by type I and type II (32 and 23 GCNs, respectively). As for MYB variants such as AGGTTA, this motif was also enriched in 15 MYB GCNs (P < 0.01). In several cases, more than one consensus was enriched (e.g. MBSI/MBSIIG or MBSI/II) (Supplementary Fig. S10, Supplementary Table S11). This in silico analysis suggests that grapevine MYB TFs may bind to more than one MYB consensus CRE (up to all three and their variants) in the promoters of co-expressed genes. This has been demonstrated experimentally for many Arabidopsis R2R3-MYB proteins, which can bind a variety of MYB sites,45 consistent with our observations.

For example, the GCN surrounding grapevine homologues of AtMYB46 and AtMYB83 (e.g. VviMYB185; VIT_06s0004g02110) were highly enriched with the CCAACC element (P < 1.50E-09) present in 64 co-expressed genes, many of which are involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis (Supplementary Tables S5 and S8). Interestingly, the MYB GCN with the highest enrichment of the TGGTTR element (7.99E-04) was VviMYB185. Many of the TGGTTR-containing promoters also correspond to secondary cell wall-related genes. The prevalence of these two elements may provide dual regulation for the majority of the GCN. This result is consistent with the function of AtMYB46 and AtMYB83 (which directly bind type IIG/AC-elements) and in regulating an extensive suite of downstream target genes involved in secondary cell wall metabolism.76 As for type I motifs such as CAGTTR, we observed a strong enrichment (P < 4.62E-05, 64 CAGTTR-containing co-expressed gene promoters) in the VviMYB30A GCN (64; Supplementary Table S8). Many CAGTTR-containing co-expressed gene promoters were highly enriched in lipid, sugar-derivative metabolism and disease-related signalling genes presumably involved in the hypersensitive cell death response. This is consistent with the role of MYB30 in Arabidopsis and its ability to bind the promoters of lipid-related genes.82 These observations suggest preferential binding of type I motifs (i.e. CAGTTR) by grapevine MYB30A and support its role in stress (i.e. osmotic) regulation in grapevine, as shown previously.12 In this sense, VviMYB30A may respond to salt stress by regulating many of the genes identified in our co-expression analysis.The cases described above are some examples of how analysis of promoter binding sites supports the functional implications of R2R3-MYB factors (e.g. secondary metabolism, stress). Our analysis also highlights that many of the co-expressed genes might actually be targets of MYB TFs within each GCN, and proposes binding preferences for each grape R2R3-MYB.3.6. Co-expression and cis-regulatory sub-network analysis of Subgroup 2 reveals a new putative regulator of stilbene biosynthesisBy incorporating multiple levels of co-expressed genes, functional evidence and promoter information, we can robustly infer the complex regulation exerted by known and novel grapevine R2R3-MYBs. This is the case with Subgroup S2 members VviMYB14 and VviMYB15. While S2 members in Arabidopsis have being linked to the control of inflorescence architecture, cold stress tolerance and the shikimate pathway,83,84 their orthologues in the Vitaceae family form part of the stilbene-regulating clade. Stilbenes, which are absent in Arabidopsis, are specifically produced in grape organs during development (e.g. in roots,20,21 and in berries,20,62 and in response to abiotic and biotic stresses85–87). These phytoalexins have a defensive role and are produced by stilbene synthases (STS), the key structural enzymes that compete with chalcone synthases for a p-coumaroyl phenylpropanoid intermediate in the production of cis-/trans-resveratrol. As recently demonstrated, the grapevine MYB14 and MYB15 TFs are involved in transcriptional regulation of STILBENE SYNTHASES STS41 and STS29.20To understand large-scale transcriptional control of stilbene-related MYBs, we combined the GCN of MYB14 (VIT_07s0005g03340) and MYB15 (VIT_05s0049g01020) with that of MYB13 (VIT_05s0049g01010), the uncharacterized closest homologue of MYB15 (Fig. 5A). We observed that a core set of seven STS transcripts were co-expressed with all three MYBs while 21 STS genes were shared between MYB13 and MYB14 (Supplementary Table S5). Three STSs were co-expressed with MYB15 and MYB14 (including STS41) while 10 were exclusively co-expressed with MYB14. Eleven (out of 12) PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE (PAL) genes, constituting the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway, were present in the MYB14 GCN (BIN 16.2.1, P < 3.87E-24) while only one PAL gene was shared between MYB14 and MYB13. Moreover, transcripts involved in transcriptional regulation, such as a WRKY factors (VIT_01s0010g03930) and seven serine/threonine protein kinases that are likely involved in signalling (e.g. VIT_10s0071g00440), were co-expressed with MYB13 and MYB15. Genes from the MYB15 GCN encode for many pathogenesis-related (4 thaumatin, 2 osmotin), nitrilase (11 transcripts, BIN26.8, P < 2.75E-11), and receptor kinase (15 transcripts, BIN30.2, P < 9.96E-05) transcripts. Inducible defence-related proteins such as thaumatin, osmotin and nitrilases are commonly elicited during pathogen infection and in situations of osmotic stress, cold, wounding and development.88 These results suggest that S2 members are involved in defence responses not only by regulating STS transcripts but also by regulating other stress-related transcripts.

This analysis showed that these STS promoters were highly over-represented (P < 0.001) with CRE-regulated by the R2R3-MYBs (i.e. GGTWGTTR, ACCWWCC), WRKY (i.e. TTTGACY) and AP2/ERF (i.e. RYCGAC, GCCGGC) TFs (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Table S8). CREs within co-expression modules (in combination with many other CREs) provide adequate fine control of genes during stress and development.25,26 Thus, our analysis reinforces the notion that Subgroup 2 MYBs are likely to bind a larger set of STS promoter regions than previously shown.20 These findings also highlight the fact that different upstream stress response pathways, related to jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling pathways through involvement of the WRKY (i.e. WRKY03, VIT_01s0010g03930; WRKY24, VIT_08s0058g00690 and WRKY29, VIT_10s0116g01200) and AP2/ERF (i.e. VIT_16s0013g00890, VIT_18s0072g00260) regulators, respectively, may be part of a larger grapevine STS regulatory network. We also observed significant enrichment of MYB and WRKY binding sites in the promoter regions of biotic stress-related (BIN 20.1) co-expressed genes. Moreover, MYB and AP2/ERF binding sites were enriched in the promoter regions of abiotic stress (BIN 20.2) and nitrilase (BIN26.8) transcripts that are unique to the MYB15 GCN. Taken together, this supports the idea that many stress-related genes are also part of the MYB13/14/15 regulatory network. While many co-expressed genes are shared between the MYB13/14/15 GCNs, some WRKY (VIT_01s0010g03930, VIT_10s0116g01200) and AP2/ERF (VIT_16s0013g01120) TFs may be regulated in a coordinated way in individual MYB networks. The major TF families involved in the transcriptional networks of plant immunity often comprise R2R3-MYB, WRKY and AP2/ERFs TFs, and their binding motifs are enriched in the promoters of co-expressed genes.25,89 These observations may explain the enrichment of stress-related BIN terms, specific TFs and CRE and their combinatorial associations as reported here. In summary, our multifaceted analyses indicate that MYB13 may have functional similarities with MYB14/15 and that the complexity in STS regulation might require co-operation of other TF families.3.7. A sub-specialized expression of MYB13 correlates with the accumulation of stilbenes under non-stressed conditionsTo understand the possible role of MYB13 in regulating stilbene biosynthesis, we investigated its expression under different conditions, including vegetative organs, two berry developmental series and biotic/abiotic stress treatments (Fig. 6). Due to the high homology (80%) of the coding sequence of MYB15 and MYB13, we designed gene-specific primers in the 3'UTR of both genes. We also measured stilbene levels to see if these were correlated with MYB13 expression. MYB13 was expressed in non-stressed leaves (young and old), roots and stems of Chardonnay and Shiraz cultivars, consistent with the piceid accumulation found in these organs (Fig. 6A). The high stilbene content in the roots was comparable with strong expression of MYB13, MYB14, MYB15 and several STSs (STS25/27/29 and STS41/45). However, where there was almost no expression of MYB14 and MYB15, we found high expression of MYB13, correlated with the detection of piceids, particularly in leaves and stems. These results suggest a role of MYB13 in regulating stilbene biosynthesis in these organs under non-stressed conditions. They also suggest that the expression of STS genes other than STS25/27/29 and STS41/48 might be regulated in these organs by MYB13. qPCR expression profiles of MYB14, MYB15 and MYB13 in (A) grapevine vegetative organs, (B) berry developmental stages and (C) in response to abiotic and biotic stress.

Data points in (B) are given as weeks during berry ripening (veraison; labelled with an arrow) starting at week seven.Analysis of MYB13 transcript levels during development in the black-skinned ‘Pinot Noir’ berry and the white-skinned ‘Riesling’ berry showed that MYB13 expression peaks around veraison. Expression of MYB14 is only concomitant with MYB13 in ‘Pinot Noir’, as in ‘Riesling’ both MYB14 and MYB15 peak at later ripening stages. This observation suggests that MYB13 may have a critical role in regulating stilbenes at the onset of ripening in berries (preceding the expression of its paralogues in some cultivars). These profiles are consistent with previous data from ‘Pinot Noir’,20 where MYB14, MYB15 and STS (STS25/27/29 and STS41/48) expression were correlated with the accumulation of glycosylated resveratrol (trans-piceid) during the late stages of berry ripening. Furthermore, stilbene accumulation has also been found to increase during early stages, when MYB14 and MYB15 transcripts are not detected. This suggests that another regulator affects stilbene biosynthesis, possibly MYB13.The concentration of stilbenes produced in ripening berries is only 1–5% of those in berries or leaves subject to biotic and abiotic stresses.85–87 Thus, we further tested the expression of MYB13 in response to conditions that significantly increase STS expression, namely wounding, UV-C radiation and downy mildew infection,4 and observed several differences between expression of the three genes. In general, MYB13 showed much lower transcript accumulation under stress conditions than MYB14 and MYB15. However, on examining fold induction between treated/untreated conditions, MYB13 appears to have a particular stress-response with different expression kinetics. Upon wounding, MYB13 expression peaked 96 hours post-treatment (hpt), in contrast to that of MYB14 and MYB15, which had a subtler peak at 1 hpt. The behaviour of MYB13 following UV-C treatment was more similar to that observed for MYB14 and MYB15, but with lower intensity. Finally, downy mildew infection produced the most striking response, with the MYB13 transcript beginning to accumulate at very early stages (48 hpt) and reaching much higher fold induction levels than MYB14 and MYB15.Compared to MYB14 and MYB15, MYB13 appears to be prominently expressed in roots and leaves, where stilbenes are accumulated. During fruit development MYB13 seem to precede the expression of its paralogues, although this appears to be cultivar-specific. By including the stress-responsive experiments, we suggest an MYB13 expression sub-specialization related to an STS basal expression in vegetative tissues but also to a specific induction to biotic stress. The Gene Network Analysis conducted here for the three Subgroup 2 MYBs will help to direct subsequent characterization approaches in planta to demonstrate MYB13’s ability to induce stilbene accumulation through the activation of STS genes.4. Concluding remarksGene regulatory networks, controlled in part by TFs, have essential roles in all processes of life, from metabolism to cell cycle control, differentiation and response to the environment. A clearer understanding of the roles of TFs may allow us to predict and alter the behaviour of gene networks in important processes such as disease resistance, or to use them for crop trait improvement programs.Following the sequencing of the V. vinifera genome, progress in transcriptomic data acquisition has facilitated the collection of large-scale data with enormous potential for gene discovery. In this context, our study aimed to find the biological processes regulated by grapevine R2R3-MYB TFs by combining gene expression data, phylogenetic information, DNA-binding motif discovery and experimental evidence. Our results suggest that these regulators are involved in a plethora of processes, possibly in coordination with other specific TFs. We observed an over-representation of genes co-expressed with MYBs that were related to transcriptional regulation, cell wall biogenesis and secondary metabolism, the latter playing a significant role in fruit quality, health-promotion and plant disease prevention. Our study also provides evidence on the evolution of this family through tandem duplications, probably retained throughout domestication, that have contributed significantly to the expansion of genes linked to these quality traits. One of the main outcomes of this study is the large collection of candidate genes and biological processes to be tested in future gene characterizations. Validation of these candidates will require studying transcriptional control exerted by R2R3-MYBs using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques and expression profiling experiments (e.g. by ChIP-Seq). Further DNA-binding experiments will benefit from this study as discovery of over-represented motifs in the genomic regions of co-expressed genes may direct protein–DNA interactions assays (e.g. by electrophoretic mobility shift assays).We would specially like to thank Dr Ian B.

IntroductionA primary objective of genomic and metagenomic analyses is to deduce potential comprehensive functions (the functionome) harbored by an individual organism or an entire community in diverse environments. However, evaluation of the potential functionome still remains difficult in comparison with the functional annotation of individual genes or proteins, principally because no standard methodology to extract functional category information, such as metabolism, energy generation, and membrane transport systems, has yet been established. In recent years, detailed and comprehensive functional categories present in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)1 and SEED2 databases have been used to identify functional features in comparative genomics and metagenomics represented by the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS),3 Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology,4 and Metagenome Analyzer5 systems. Each system employs a similarity-based method for functional annotations but utilizes different databases for protein sequences, default threshold values, and ortholog identification (ID) numbers for mapping annotated sequences to functional categories depending on the desired outputs, specifically pathways in KEGG or subsystems in SEED. However, these functional categories still remain too broad to distinguish metabolic or physiological features. Thus, the evaluation of existing tools and development of new tools are required to characterize potential physiological and metabolic pathways in actual ecosystems.6To resolve this problem, we previously developed a new method to evaluate the potential functionome based on calculating the completion ratio of four types of KEGG modules, i.e., pathways, molecular complexes, functional sets, and signatures,7 represented as the percentage of a module component filled with the input KEGG Orthology (KO)-assigned genes by KAAS. In conjunction with the development of this method, a stand-alone calculation system of the module completion ratio (MCR) has been developed.8 However, it is difficult for general scientists who are not familiar with bioinformatic tools to handle the massive sequence data required for evaluation of potential functionomes in their own data. In addition, it is not easy to visualize the mapping patterns of KO-assigned query genes to the KEGG modules in detail. Thus, in December of 2013, we launched a prototype system, the metabolic and physiological potential evaluator (MAPLE), to automate our newly developed method.9 MCR is an easy-to-understand measure to evaluate the functional potential, and generally, there is a correlation between the completeness of a KEGG module and the likelihood that an organism can perform the physiological function corresponding to the module; however, its interpretation may become difficult when the KOs used for a module are shared with other independent modules, (e.g. the modules such as the reductive TCA cycle and TCA cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis), and the MCR does not necessarily reflect the working probability of each functional module. Moreover, when the module is complete, its abundance becomes a more important measure for comparing the functional robustness among different genomes or metagenomes from diverse environments. Thus, we aimed to improve the MAPLE system to increase the usefulness of our evaluation method and to facilitate the interpretation of the results of functional analyses using this system.In this study, we present MAPLE version 2.1.0, an improvement of the original MAPLE system that permits the estimation of functional abundance and indicates the working probability of the MCR results by statistical testing. We also highlight the significant differences in abundance and biodiversity of the physiological functions among four metagenomic datasets generated by the global ocean sampling (GOS) expedition with this system.2. Materials and methods2.1. OverviewMAPLE is an automatic system for mapping genes in an individual genome and metagenome to the functional modules defined by KEGG and for calculating the MCR and module abundance. Overview of MAPLE system is described in Supplementary text and Figure S1.2.2. Module completion ratioThe completion ratio of all KEGG functional modules in each sample was calculated based on a Boolean algebra-like equation as previously described.8 The calculation program was slightly modified according to the changes in the Boolean algebra-like equation defined for some modules by the KEGG.2.3. Calculation of module abundanceThe total number of sequence reads assigned to each KO constructing a module was divided by the average length of each KO group for normalization of KO abundance. This normalized KO abundance is described at the lower right corner of each KO box when the mapping pattern of the query genes to the module is displayed. The module abundance is calculated based on the normalized KO abundance. For example, the module M00529, defined as a reaction of denitrification, is composed of four reaction steps (Supplementary Fig. S2). In each K number set, vertically connected K numbers indicate a complex whereas horizontally located K numbers indicate alternatives.8,9 Because the enzyme responsible for the first reaction (nitrate reductase) is composed of four (left side) or two KO complexes (right side), the abundance of the first reaction step becomes 0 unless all KOs vertically connected are filled with the KO assigned genes. When all vertically connected KOs are filled, the minimal value of KO abundance in the vertically connected boxes becomes the abundance at the first step. Thus, the abundance of the first step in module M00529 is 63. As the second step, when two horizontally located KOs are filled with the KO assigned genes, the abundance at the second step becomes 1,129, which is sum of both KOs. The abundance at the third step becomes 56 in a similar manner as the first step, and that of the last step is 46 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because the module abundance becomes the minimal value among all steps, the abundance of module M00529 is calculated to be 46. The method for comparison of the module abundances among different metagenomic samples is described in Supplementary text.2.4. Analysis of the Q-value for determining the significance of module completenessGenerally, it is expected that the MCR is linked to the likelihood that the organisms perform the physiological function corresponding to the module. However, when the KOs used for a module are shared with the other modules, the MCR does not necessarily reflect the working probability of each functional module (Supplementary Fig. S3-F). Thus, the relationships among module completion of the targeted module, module completion of other modules to which the same KOs are assigned, and the contribution of specific KOs of each module to module completion should be considered when a module is not complete.8 Namely, even if the same MCR was observed in different modules, the working probability of the physiological function is not necessarily equal among these MCRs. To avoid these problems, we proposed the use of the Q-value for determining the significance of module completion (see Supplementary text). This measure, which represents the probability that a reaction module is identified by chance, is calculated based on the statistics of sequence similarity scores (e.g. E-values) using the concept of multiple testing corrections, according to the definition of the KEGG reaction module (i.e. Boolean algebra-like equation).2.5. Characterization of the microbial community structure based on ribosomal proteinsRibosomal proteins are well conserved among all organisms and possess sequences specific to each individual organism; therefore, ribosomal proteins can be used for identification of organisms. Accordingly, we examined how accurately KAAS, which is used in the MAPLE system, can annotate the ribosomal proteins taxonomically. All prokaryotic ribosomal proteins available from the NCBI database (189,020 proteins) were subjected to annotation using MAPLE, and the results were then compared with the original taxonomic annotation. Consequently, since there was no significant difference between the original annotation at the phylum level and those by KAAS, despite the fact that the MAPLE system uses the KEGG database, which contains only completed genome data (Supplementary Fig. S4), we concluded that MAPLE could be effectively applied for identification of organisms by construction of a metagenome based on ribosomal proteins. For application of MAPLE to taxonomic analysis, we calculated the ratio of bacteria and archaea in the metagenome based on the mapping pattern to the module M90000 for prokaryotic ribosomes and the taxonomic annotation of each ribosomal protein. As mentioned above, because the archaeal ribosome, which contains 58 ribosomal proteins, has six more proteins than the bacterial ribosome, we normalized the total number of archaeal ribosomal proteins to the number of bacterial ribosomal proteins by multiplying by 52/58. We summed up the number of bacterial ribosomes and normalized archaeal ribosomes and then used this sum as a denominator to calculate the ratio of archaea and bacteria. We also calculate the ratio of each taxonomic level defined by KEGG, such as phylum and class, in the metagenome using the same method.2.6. Metagenomic analysis of environmental samples using the MAPLE systemWe downloaded the metagenomic sequences generated by GOS expedition10,11 and the environmental data for each sampling site from the iMicrobe database (http://data.imicrobe.us/project/view/26 17 June 2016, date last accessed). Among 83 samples, we selected four metagenomic samples including over 1 million protein-coding genes, two from Sargasso Sea (GS000c and GS000d) and two from near the Galápagos Islands (GS030 and GS031). Detail information about these sites is provided in Supplementary Table S1. Approximately 1.21 million to 1.43 million amino acid sequences in the multi-FASTA format were submitted to MAPLE through the web interface (Supplementary Fig. S1-1).3. Results3.1. Comparison of complete modulesKEGG modules (587 modules as of December 2014) are modular functional units based on the KEGG pathways and are categorized into pathway modules, structural complexes, functional sets, and genetic signatures. We applied metagenomic sequence data from four GOS sites to the MAPLE system based on the KEGG modules and summarized all MAPLE results (Supplementary Table S2). Using the MAPLE results, we first investigated the ratio of complete modules to all KEGG modules to characterize the differences in potential functionomes among the four GOS sites. According to individual taxonomic rank (ITR), the highest ratio of the complete module was found in the GS000c site (33.9%), whereas the lowest ratio (26.8%) was found in the GS030 site (Fig. 1A–2 and Supplementary Table S3). ITR is a second taxonomic subcategory, containing mostly phylum-level information, such as that for Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria, as well as class and order information, as defined in the KEGG Organisms database. These values for ITR were 5.3% lower than those for the whole community (WC) containing various taxonomic ranks appearing in GS031 and 9.7% lower than those for the WC in GS000c. Namely, some of incomplete modules by ITR were completed by WC, which is composed of a combination of various taxonomic ranks. We defined the module that was completed only by the WC as the OWC module (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3). A similar trend was observed for the other two sites (GS000d and GS031), and there were approximate differences of 5–7% between the ratios of complete modules by ITR and WC. The GS000c site tended to have a high completion module rate for pathway modules, structural complexes, and functional sets, but not for signature modules, with a particularly remarkable completion rate in the functional set module, which contained functions such as aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, nucleotide sugar biosynthesis, and various two-component regulatory systems (Fig. 1A–2).

ITR: individual taxonomic rank. WC: whole community, OWC: only whole community.The KEGG modules primarily fall into four classes (A, B, C, and D) based on distribution patterns of MCRs in all species registered in the KEGG Organisms database.8 Of the 587 KEGG functional modules, only 31 (5%) of modules in prokaryotic species were grouped into class A defined as ‘universal’. All modules grouped into class A were completed by ITR except for module M00526 (lysine biosynthesis, DAP dehydrogenase pathway) but M00526 was not completed even by WC for all GOS sites (Fig. 1B–2). The ratio of complete modules by ITR in class B defined as ‘restricted’ was <20%, except for GS000c, and even those by WC did not exceed 25% for sites GS000d, GS030, and GS031, although the GS000c site had a ratio of more than 30%. Modules over 63% in class C defined as ‘diversified’ were completed by the ITR in GS000c, GS000d, and GS031, and the ratio of complete modules by the WC ranged from 71% to 76% for all GOS sites except GS030. As an overall trend, there were no significant differences in the ratios of complete modules in four categorized classes based on the distribution patterns of MCRs in all classes from A to D (Fig. 1B–2).Modules completed by <10% of the prokaryotic or eukaryotic species were defined as ‘rare’ in the modules grouped into classes B and C; 269 modules (pathway: 78, structural complex: 110, functional set: 66, and signature: 15) were identified as rare modules in the prokaryotic species (Fig. 1C–1). Generally, few rare modules were completed by the ITR, and the ratio of complete modules was <20% for all GOS sites. However, some incomplete rare modules became complete by the WC, and the highest ratio (~36%) of complete modules was observed in the pathway modules for all GOS sites (Fig. 1C–2). Class D, which accounted for 26% (149 modules) of all modules, comprised nonprokaryotic modules that were not completed by any single prokaryotic species. Unlike the case of all pathway modules shown in Fig. 1A–2, the GS000d and GS031 sites tended to have higher completion rations for rare pathway modules than the GS000c site.In the natural environment, the microbial community is mainly composed of various uncultivable microbes, including those that are phylogenetically distant from the registered microbes in the KEGG Organisms database. Thus, the genes derived even from the same microbial genome in the environmental sample are not necessarily assigned to those from the microbes within the same taxonomic rank. This is one of major explanations for the differences in the ratios of complete modules between the WC and ITR, which were observed mainly for the pathway module. Indeed, almost all modules that were completed only by the WC were categorized into class D, with rare modules belonging to classes B and C. Two class D modules (M00013: malonate semialdehyde pathway and M00077: chondroichin sulphate degradation) and two other rare modules (M00358: coenzyme M biosynthesis and M00088: ketone body biosynthesis) were common modules completed only by the WC for all four GOS sites. Module M00013 was completed by organisms within several eukaryotic taxonomic ranks; however, M00077 was completed by microbes within several types of bacterial taxonomic ranks, such as Planctomyces, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, with the exception of GS0030, despite the fact that M00077 was a nonprokaryotic module. Chondroichin sulphate, a sulphated glycosaminoglycan composed of a chain of alternating sugars, is an important structural component of cartilage.12 Thus, several bacterial species may cooperatively degrade chondroichin sulphate derived from the cartilage of marine creatures or some unknown single microbes that are phylogenetically distant from known prokaryotic species.3.2. Biodiversity and abundance of the complete modulesMAPLE highlights the differences in the potential functions of organisms and environmental samples if the MCRs of various modules differ. However, in the first version of MAPLE, we could not clarify the differences in the functional potential of modules commonly completed in all samples. Accordingly, we improved the MAPLE system in order to determine the diversity of the ITRs that completed the module and the module abundance for every ITR (Supplementary Fig. S5). We then characterized the common complete modules among the four GOS sites based on these two measures. Out of 444 KEGG modules (excluding the nonprokaryotic modules), 155 modules were completed by the WC, whereas 136 modules were completed by ITRs. Among 155 complete modules (88 pathway, 55 complex, and 12 functional set modules), there were 42 pathway modules and 24 structural complex modules showing more than 2-fold differences in module abundance ratios among the four GOS sites; these data were normalized according to the average length of each KO and number of ribosomal proteins identified at each GOS site (see Materials and methods; Fig. 2). For example, module M00572, responsible for pimeloyl-ACP biosynthesis related to biotin metabolism, showed a difference of more than 10-fold in the module abundance ratio although the module was completed by only one ITR, Gammaproteobacteria-others, i.e. Gammaproteobacteria excluding the order Enterobacteriales (<U+03B3>-others) for the four GOS sites. This module, which included six reaction steps, contained two module-specific KOs, K02169 and K02170, and there were substantial differences in the abundances of K02170 between GS031 and the other three sites. Indeed, most of the sequences assigned to K02170 were derived from <U+03B3>-others, whereas some sequences from Deltaproteobacteria, having MCRs of 83.3%, also contributed to the increase in the total module abundance. To compare the abundance of this module by <U+03B3>-others among GS000c, GS000d, GS030, and GS031 sites, the module abundance was normalized by the number of ribosomal proteins appearing in each metagenome (see Supplementary Text). The normalized abundances of each site were 0.009 (GS000c), 0.004 (GS000d), 0.003 (GS030), and 0.025 (GS031), respectively, with a ratio of 3:1.3:1:8.3. In contrast, for the structural complex module responsible for the fructose transport system (M00218), there was a 12-fold greater difference in the module abundance ratio between Sargasso Sea sites (GS000c and GS000d) and the other two sites near the Galápagos Islands (GS030 and GS031), despite the fact that the module was completed by only one ITR of Alphaproteobacteria for all sites (Fig. 2). The population of Alphaproteobacteria for the GS000c site was 36%, whereas that of GS000d was almost the same as those from the Galápagos Islands (57–59%). Thus, the abundance of this module did not necessarily depend on the total bacterial population within Alphaproteobacteria, and only limited species within this class presumably contribute to the abundance of this function. In contrast to module M00218, the two Sargasso Sea sites exhibited abundance ratios more than 10-fold higher than those of the other two sites near the Galápagos Islands in module M00222 (phosphate transport system), which was categorized into the universal module (class A). Although most major ITRs contributing to the abundance of module M00222 were from Alphaproteobacteria, this module was also completed by two other common ITRs, <U+03B3>-others, and Deltaproteobacteria for all sites. However, the diversity of ITRs contributing to the module abundance for the Sargasso Sea sites was greater than that of the sites near the Galápagos Islands, and other ITRs, such as Thaumarchaeota, Firmicutes-Clostridia (Firmicutes-C), Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria, also contributed to the total module abundance. Besides these modules, four other modules classified in functional categories, such as pyrimidine metabolism (M00051 and M00053), photosynthesis (M00597), and DNA polymerase (M00264), showed 10-fold greater differences in module abundance ratios among the four GOS sites.

The upper histogram shows MCR patterns of the KEGG module. The bars outlined by dashed lines indicate the MCRs of the WC. Uppercase characters A to D under the upper histogram show the module class used in Fig. 1, and ‘R’ indicates rare modules.

The MAR was calculated by dividing abundance of each module by the minimum abundance among the four GOS sites. The modules showing 2-fold greater differences in the MAR among the four GOS sites are represented.Comparison of biodiversity contributing to the complete module and relative module abundance in the pathway and structural complex modules among the four GOS sites.

As shown in Fig. 3, the population patterns of ITRs contributing to the module abundance were similar for the four GOS sites, with the exception of GS000c. Alphaproteobacteria accounted for 80% or more of the module abundance in GS000d, GS030, and GS031, and after adding the second and third major ITRs, i.e. Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, more than 98% of the modules were accounted for. With respect to GS000c, the ratio of Alphaproteobacteria was low (63%), whereas that of Gammaproteobacteria for the second major ITR was more than two times higher than that of the other three sites. The remaining 15% was nearly evenly occupied by various ITRs, such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes-C, Deltaproteobacteria, and Thaumarchaeota. Modules M00338 and M00082, which were categorized as restricted (class B) and diversified (class C) modules, respectively, did not show significant differences in module abundance ratios, except for GS000d, which had a lower module abundance than the other sites (Fig. 2). Similar to the case of module M00018, the patterns of a variety of ITRs, including those that completed the module M00082 (fatty acid biosynthesis-initiation), and the module abundance ratio of each ITR were similar for GS030 and GS031 but obviously different for GS000c and GS000d, despite the fact that Alphaproteobacteria was the major ITR contributing to module abundance for both sites (Fig. 3). In contrast, with respect to M00338 (cysteine biosynthesis), various ITRs and the module abundance ratios differed completely from each other. However, Bacteroidetes, one of the major contributors to the module abundance, was shared among the four GOS sites. For example, this module was completed by eight types of ITRs in GS000c but only by two types of ITRs in GS031, and two eukaryotic ITRs (Vertebrate and Amoebozoa) accounted for 14% of the total module abundance (28% in total) in GS030. In GS000c, two ITRs (<U+03B3>-others and Alphaproteobacteria) that never appeared at the other three sites accounted for 38% and 11% of the total module abundance, respectively.

Evaluation of the MCR according to the Q-valueAs mentioned in the section Analysis of the Q-value for determining the significance of module completeness, the Q-value is useful because the MCR has limitations. We here investigate the relationship between MCR and Q-value in each module for the four GOS sites, in order to show the advantage of Q-value.We found higher MCRs were generally associated with lower Q-values, and the Q-value was almost 0 when the MCR was 100%. However, the Q-value is not necessarily negatively correlated with the MCR. For example, we considered the module M00532 (photorespiration). This module was not completed by the WC for the GS000d, GS030, and GS031 sites; however, the MCR was higher than 80% (Fig. 4). Notably, the Q-value of this module was high for each site (0.875 for GS000d and 0.75 for both GS030 and GS031; Supplementary Table S2). In this module, which comprised 10 reaction steps, the KOs assigned to seven steps (steps 2–5 and 8–10) were module-specific, sites GS030 and GS031 lacked K14272 in step 5, and GS000d lacked K03781 and K14272 in step 4. Moreover, module M00373 (ethylmalonyl pathway related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism) was not completed by the WC at sites GS000c, GS000d, and GS030, although the MCR was 92.9%. Half of the 14 reaction steps included in this module were module-specific, and these three sites lacked only one KO, K14451, which was assigned to the last module-specific step in this module. According to the definition, the Q-value emphasizes the completion of module-specific KOs for evaluating the working probability; thus, even though a high MCR value is shown, the Q-value is high when the module-specific KO is missing.

The number of modules with the Q-value <0.5 in WC is somewhat larger than that in ITR in all GOS sites.Comparison of MCR and Q-value patterns of pathway modules by ITRs and WCs among the four GOS sites.

The number of modules with the Q-value <0.5 in WC is somewhat larger than that in ITR in all GOS sites.Although module M00095 (C5 isoprenoid biosynthesis in the mevalonate pathway) was not completed in the WC, the MCR was high (85.7%) for the four GOS sites, similar to those of the modules M00532; however, the Q-value of this module was low (0.25). There are four module-specific reaction steps (steps 3–6) in the module comprising seven reaction steps, and the KO assigned to step 5 was missing for all GOS sites, similar to the results observed for the module M00532. However, there was a notable difference in the module structure of the missing reaction step; that is, reaction step 5 consisted of alternative genes (KOs), i.e. isozymes. According to the definition, the Q-value becomes lower when more isozymes are available; thus, it is low in such a case, even if module-specific KOs are missing.3.4. Microbial community structure based on ribosomal proteinsTo compare the microbial community structure among the four GOS sites, we analysed the taxonomic composition at the phylum level based on the ribosomal proteins comprising prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes (see Materials and methods). As shown in Supplementary Table S1, because filters with a pore size of 0.1–0.22 µm were used to recover the cells from seawater collected at the four GOS sites in the previous studies,10,11 after prefiltration with filters having a pore size of 0.8 µm, most of the recovered cells were expected to be prokaryotic. As expected, more than 99% of the microbial community was composed of prokaryotes for all GOS sites, particularly the GS030 site; bacteria accounted for 99.9%, whereas archaea accounted for ~2–6% at the other three sites (Fig. 5). Although the ratio of archaea at site GS000c (5.9%) was higher than that at other sites (GS000d: 2.3%, GS030: 0.07%, and GS031: 3.5%), the archaeal population in the microbial community was generally very low.

(A) GS000c, (B) GS000d, (C) GS030, and (D) GS031.The major bacterial taxon at all GOS sites was Alphaproteobacteria; the proportion of Alphaproteobacteria within the WC was ~60%, except for at site GS000c, where the proportion was only 36%. Conversely, site GS000c exhibited the highest proportion of Gammaproteobacteria (26%), which was the second most common taxon for all sites. Another major difference between sites GS000c and GS000d was the proportions of Firmicuctes and Bacteroidetes; for both organisms, the proportion tended to be higher at site GS000c than at site GS000d. In contrast, the population of Cyanobacteria was four times higher in GS000d (8%) than in GS000c, despite the similarities in environmental and sampling conditions of these two sites.10 With respect to the other two sites near the Galápagos Islands, there were no substantial differences in bacterial proportions, with the exception that the proportion of Actinobacteria (6%) was three times higher at site GS031 than at site GS0030, whereas almost no archaea were detected at site GS030.4. DiscussionThe original MAPLE system has been used for metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiome13 and for comparative functional analysis of individual microbes, even within candidate phyla.14,15 There is generally a correlation between the completeness of a KEGG module and the likelihood that an organism or microbial community performs the physiological function. However, the MCR does not necessarily reflect the working probability of each functional module because the KOs used for each module are shared between other independent modules (e.g. between TCA cycle [M00009] and the reductive TCA cycle [M00173], and between glycolysis [M00001] and gluconeogenesis [M00003]). Thus, we introduced the Q-value parameter to the MAPLE system to statistically re-evaluate the working probability based on the MCR, and several modules, which were deduced to have a higher working probability, were suggested based on the Q-values of the incomplete modules in this study. The Q-value is also helpful for evaluating the working probability of the functional module in the individual genome, and modules with lower Q-values, such as glycolysis (MCR: 90%, Q-value: 0.281) and gluconeogenesis (MCR: 85.7%, Q-value: 0.375), could be completed by manual curation in the genome of Ca. C. subterraneum.15 Thus, the Q-value is thought to be a good suggestive index to determine the working probability when the functional modules are not completed in the metagenome or in individual genomes.In addition to the Q-value, we also introduced the concepts of biodiversity and the abundance of complete modules for more detailed analyses of the complete modules because we could not distinguish the properties of complete modules shared between the different environmental samples using the original MAPLE system. To demonstrate the usefulness of the new MAPLE system, we used four metagenomic sequence datasets generated by the GOS expedition. When we compared the abundance of each functional module among the four GOS sites, we used the module abundance normalized by the sum of ribosomal proteins constructing the prokaryotic ribosome module (M90000). Generally, most environmental metagenomic analyses target prokaryotes, and very few eukaryotic sequences (<1%) were detected in the metagenomic sample in this study. In such cases, it is easy to normalize the module abundance according to the total number of prokaryotic ribosomal proteins; however, when eukaryotic sequences are frequently detected, eukaryotic ribosomal proteins also should be considered for normalization of the module abundance. The eukaryotic ribosome is composed of 79 ribosomal proteins, including two accessory proteins; importantly, 33 KOs corresponding to the ribosomal proteins are shared between archaea and eukaryotes, similar to the case of bacteria and archaea. Thus, when the number of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins is calculated, we have to consider this point.In many metagenomic analyses, 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification are used to compare microbial community structures among different environments.16 In recent studies, this PCR-based amplicon approach has targeted the V4 region because different regions of the 16S rRNA gene have been shown to yield varying degrees of accuracy in taxonomic assignments.17 However, prokaryotic species exhibit variations in the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene, and it is impossible to determine the copy numbers of individual uncultivable, unknown microbes present in actual microbial communities. Thus, because taxonomic compositions based on amplicon sequences are strongly influenced by copy numbers in addition to basic PCR bias, this approach is not useful for the analysis of microbial community structure. On the other hand, a new method based on universal single-copy genes, which provide prokaryotic species boundaries at higher resolution than 16S rRNA gene, has been used to estimate relative abundances of known and currently unknown microbial community members with metagenomic data at species-level resolution.18 However, community structure analysis at such high resolution is not necessarily required in metagenomic analyses of natural environments, unlike that of the human gut microbiome, because many community members have not yet been cultivated or identified at the species level. Thus, community structure analyses at the phylum or class level based on ribosomal proteins using the new version (version 2.1.0) of the MAPLE system are thought to be feasible for analysis of metagenomes from the natural environments. Although the sequence lengths generated by Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq sequencers (at most 400–500 bp as an assembled contig of the paired-end sequences) are shorter than the Sanger sequences used in this study, we have already confirmed that there are no discernible differences in KO ID assignment and mapping ratios of KO-assigned coding sequences for the KEGG modules in the metagenomic sequences of the human gut microbiome when comparing Sanger and Illumina reads.8,19 Finally, user’s guide of MAPLE is described in the Supplementary Data.We wish to thank H.

Z-DNA has been known to play a significant role in transcription and genome stability but the biological meaning and positions of Z-DNA-forming sites (ZFSs) in the human genome has not been fully explored. To obtain genome-wide map of ZFSs, Zaa with two Z-DNA-binding domains was used for ChIP-Seq analysis. A total of 391 ZFSs were found and their functions were examined in vivo. A large portion of ZFSs was enriched in the promoter regions and contain sequences with high potential to form Z-DNA. Genes containing ZFSs were occupied by RNA polymerase II at the promoters and showed high levels of expression. Moreover, ZFSs were significantly related to active histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. The association of Z-DNA with active transcription was confirmed by the reporter assay system. Overall, our results suggest that Z-DNA formation depends on chromatin structure as well as sequence composition, and is associated with active transcription in human cells. The global information about ZFSs positioning will provide a useful resource for further understanding of DNA structure-dependent transcriptional regulation.","Z-DNA, a left-handed double helical DNA is structurally different from the most abundant B-DNA. Z-DNA has been known to play a significant role in transcription and genome stability but the biological meaning and positions of Z-DNA-forming sites (ZFSs) in the human genome has not been fully explored. To obtain genome-wide map of ZFSs, Zaa with two Z-DNA-binding domains was used for ChIP-Seq analysis. A total of 391 ZFSs were found and their functions were examined in vivo. A large portion of ZFSs was enriched in the promoter regions and contain sequences with high potential to form Z-DNA. Genes containing ZFSs were occupied by RNA polymerase II at the promoters and showed high levels of expression. Moreover, ZFSs were significantly related to active histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. The association of Z-DNA with active transcription was confirmed by the reporter assay system. Overall, our results suggest that Z-DNA formation depends on chromatin structure as well as sequence composition, and is associated with active transcription in human cells. The global information about ZFSs positioning will provide a useful resource for further understanding of DNA structure-dependent transcriptional regulation.1. IntroductionZ-DNA is a structural form of DNA that has a left-handed double helix and a zigzagging sugar-phosphate backbone. The bases in Z-DNA alternate between an anti and syn orientation about the N-glycosidic bond, whereas in B-DNA, they uniformly have an anti-conformation. Z-DNA easily occurs in alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, with those sequences’ propensity for forming Z-DNA in the following order: d(GC)n > d(CA)n > d(CGGG)n > d(AT)n.1–3 Z-DNA formation requires more energy than B-DNA formation, but Z-DNA can be stable under particular conditions, including those with high salt concentrations, divalent and polyvalent ions, dehydrating agents, and DNA-specific conditions such as the presence of chemically modified bases and negative supercoiling.4,5A family of proteins has the ability to bind Z-DNA through a Z-DNA-binding domain. One such protein is the human double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (hADAR1), which catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. The N-terminal region of this enzyme has a Z-DNA-binding domain composed of Za and Zß motifs. Za belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of proteins and recognizes syn-conformed purine residues, meaning it binds specifically to Z-DNA, whereas Zß does not.6 Za (residues 133–209) binds to Z-DNA better than Za (residues 121–197). Zaa can be generated by replacing Zß with Za, resulting in a much higher affinity and specificity to Z-DNA than Za.7,8 Za and Zaa have been widely used as probes for Z structure in vitro and in vivo. Motifs similar to the Za of hADAR1 are also present in other Z-DNA-binding proteins, such as E3L and DLM1, and are important for the proteins’ biological functions.9,10 Because Za of hADAR1 has a strong affinity to Z-DNA and its characteristics have been extensively studied, Za is useful for identifying Z-DNA-forming sites in cells.In human cells, Z-DNA-forming regions (ZDRs) have been predicted genome-wide by the computer programs Z-hunt and Z-catcher. Potential ZDRs are enriched near the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes.11,12 This suggests that Z-DNA functions in transcriptional regulation, and indeed, RNA polymerase II accumulates local negative supercoiling behind it as it moves along the DNA strand during transcription, creating a favourable environment for Z-DNA formation.13 In addition, experiments show that Z-DNA formation, as detected by a Z-DNA antibody, increases with the expression level of the c-myc gene,14 and Z-DNA formation, enhanced by the BAF complex, plays a role in stabilizing open chromatin, giving RNA polymerase II access to the CSF1 gene.15 In a similar manner, transcription of the HO-1 gene is increased by Z-DNA formation.16 Furthermore, the incorporation of Z-DNA into nucleosomes is unfavourable, resulting in the promoter region Z-DNA regulating transcription by establishing the boundaries of neighboring nucleosomes and producing an open chromatin state.17 In addition, Z-DNA is involved in stimulating homologous recombination, protecting the genome, and genetic instability.18–20Recently, 186 Z-DNA hotspots in human cells were identified using ZaADAR1 as a probe in an in vitro chromatin affinity precipitation (ChAP)-Sanger sequencing experiment.12 Among them, 46 hotspots were located in the centromere and were correlated with high densities of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a finding that was inconsistent with the in silico predictions of ZDRs being located mostly in TSSs.Because ZFSs have never been explored at the human genome level by high-throughput analysis, it is difficult to completely understand the biological functions of Z-DNA. Sanger sequencing technique is low throughput, making the interpretation of the sparse data difficult. In order to overcome this limitation, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with Zaa that consists of two copies of Za, followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). This method provided information on ZFSs in the human genome at high resolution and coverage. We found ZFSs with high confidence, and determined their genomic and epigenetic features. Our results support the positive correlation between Z-DNA formation and active transcription in human cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culture and the expression of ZaaHeLa cells, a human cervix carcinoma cell line, were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM media containing 10% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, Zaa were amplified by PCR using Zaa-Fok as a template, generated by Mulholland et al.21 PCR products were digested with BclI and XbaI, and cloned into the BamHI/XbaI site of pEF1a, in which a FLAG tag was added. The SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence was generated as described16 and inserted into the XmaI/AscI site of pEF1a, producing pEF1a-Zaa. pEF1a-Zaa was transfected into HeLa cells using GeneJuice (Novagen, Germany).2.2. In vitro Z-DNA cleavage assaypET28a-Fok was constructed by inserting a catalytic domain of FokI endonuclase into the HindIII/XhoI site of pET28a and a (Gly4Ser)3 linker was added upstream of Fok by cloning into the EcoRI/HindIII site, as described in Mulholland et al.21 and Kim et al.22 For generation of pET28aZa-Fok and pET28aZaa-Fok, Za or Zaa was placed in front of the (Gly4Ser)3 linker by inserting Za or Zaa into the NheI/EcoRI site in pET28a-Fok. BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells containing pET28a-Fok, pET28a-Za-Fok, or pET28a-Zaa-Fok were grown at 37 °C and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and grown for 12 hr at 18 °C. Fok, Za-Fok, and Zaa-Fok were purified using His-Bind resin (Novagen) charged with Ni2+. Purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed and analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Aliquots were stored at -80 °C. pDHg16 and pDPL6 were obtained from Addgene (USA). The supercoiled form of pDHg16 was purified using the LaboPass Mini Kit (Cosmo Genetech, Korea). The linear form was prepared by digesting supercoiled pDHg16 with PstI. For the in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay, supercoiled or linear plasmid was incubated with Fok, Za-Fok, or Zaa-Fok in digestion buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 2.5% glycerol and 0.05% NP40) at 22 °C. After 20 min, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the reaction was further incubated for 2 hr. Fok, Za-Fok, or Zaa-Fok was inactivated by heat treatment at 50 °C for 30 min. The supercoiled plasmid DNA was digested with PstI for 1 hr at 37 °C and analyzed by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. For a generation of pDPL6-ZFSs and pDPL6-negative, predicted short ZDR sequences inside ZFSs or a sequence without potential to form Z-DNA was inserted into the XbaI/SalI site of pDPL6. The resulting pDPL6-ZDRs and pDPL6-negative were used for in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay.2.3. Immunofluorescence analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)The expression of Zaa in HeLa cells was monitored by immunofluorescence analysis. Forty hours after transfection, HeLa cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for another 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with blocking solution (0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature and sequentially incubated with FLAG M2 antibody in blocking buffer for 2 hr at 37 °C, followed by incubation with Dylight 488–labelled secondary antibody (Abcam, UK) for 1 hr at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye, and samples were observed using the Olympus FluoView 1200 confocal microscope. ChIP was performed as described23 with small changes. Briefly, transfected cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cell fixation was stopped by adding 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.1375 M and incubating for 5 min. After, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and collected. The cell nuclei were extracted with buffer 1 (10 mM HEPES [pH 6.5], 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM PMSF) and buffer 2 (10 mM HEPES [pH 6.5], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM PMSF), and isolated nuclei pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). Chromatin with a range from 100 to 300 bp was prepared by sonication and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 µg of FLAG M2 (Sigma, USA), normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, USA), or RNA polymerase II (8WG16, Millipore, USA) antibodies and protein A/G magnetic beads (Thermo, USA). One percent of sonicated chromatin was reserved as input before immunoprecipitation. Proteinase K was added to ChIP and input samples, and the chromatin was reverse-crosslinked by incubating for 10 hr at 65 °C in buffer 4 (10 mM Tris-Cl [8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS). ChIPed DNA and input DNA was purified and used for PCR or sequencing library construction. The primers for Zaa ChIP-qPCR were shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.4. ChIP-SeqThe sequencing library was prepared as described24 with a few modifications. ChIPed DNA and input DNA fragments were end-repaired, dA tailed, and ligated with the genomic DNA adapters provided by Illumina (USA). Adapter-ligated DNA fragments were purified and amplified by PCR. Gel extraction was performed to isolate 200–400-bp PCR products. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and HiSeq 2500. Sequence alignment was performed using Bowtie2 (v2.25) on the human genome (hg18). The sequencing data of Zaa rep1, rep2, rep3, input and IgG were deposited in the NCBI GEO database (GSE71682). The overall scheme of ChIP-Seq is shown in Fig. 2C.2.5. Data analysisThe ChIP-Seq data was summarized in Supplementary Table S2. Uniquely mappable reads were used for the following computational analyses. Using IgG data as a control, Zaa peaks on each Zaa replicate were detected by SPP (v.1.10.1) with the following options: -x:-500:85, -npeak = 300,000. Input DNA was also used as a control but IgG data was applied to further analysis for practical comparison purpose.25 Reproducible Zaa peaks between replicates were determined by Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) analysis.26 Self-consistent peaks between two pseudoreplicates (half of mapped reads in each replicate) were found using IDR = 0.01. Peaks consistent between pooled-pseudoreplicates (half of mapped reads pooled across all replicates) were found using IDR = 0.001. In addition, peaks consistent between three pairs of Zaa replicates were found using IDR = 0.05. Of three consistent peak numbers, the maximum peak number was used as a cutoff. With this cutoff, top-ranked peaks were selected in the pooled replicates. Then, the Zaa peaks were examined if they were overlapped with frequently overrepresented random peaks called blacklisted regions. The blacklist detected in the human genome was downloaded from the website (https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists, 26 April 2016, date last accessed). After filtering, the final 391 Zaa peaks were selected as ZFSs and used for further analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated by counting reads mapped within ZFSs for every sample and comparing those read counts across samples.Genes containing ZFSs near the transcription start site (± 2 kb) were subjected to a Gene Ontology enrichment analysis by DAVID. Known motifs that were significantly enriched in ZFSs were examined by Homer (v4.8). The presence of ZDRs within the ZFSs were predicted by Z-catcher with two cutoff values for the negative supercoiling density, -0.08 or -0.07. For comparison, 10,000 random peaks were selected arbitrarily with the distribution of length of ZFSs. The supercoiling density value required for Z-DNA formation was calculated for ZFSs and random peak regions. The region 2 kb upstream and downstream from the centre of each ZFS and random peak was divided into 20-bp windows. The supercoiling density value was calculated in a 20-bp sliding window overlapped with 18-bp. The value for each window was plotted.For the gene expression analysis, public mRNA-Seq data was downloaded and analyzed.27 Sequence reads were mapped by TopHat v2.0.9 program 28 to the human genome reference sequence (hg18). Quantification and normalization for each transcript were performed using the RPKM method (Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Million aligned sequence tags). The colocalization of ZFSs with RNA polymerase II binding sites and histone modifications was examined using the following ChIP-Seq datasets; RNA Polymerase II (SRR349806, SRR349811, and SRR765748) and histones H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H3K79me3 (SRP002252). The heatmap was drawn by calculating the normalized read counts for 50-bp windows within ZFSs and 3 kb upstream and downstream.2.6. Luciferase reporter assayFor the in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay, predicted short ZDRs inside ZFSs and one negative control were selected and cloned into the NheI/XhoI site of pGL3-HS containing minimal heat-shock promoter.29 The resulting pGL3-HS-ZFSs or pGL3-HS-negative were transfected into HeLa cells and luciferase reporter assay was performed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA). Luciferase activities of each pGL3-HS-ZFSs and pGL3-HS-negative were normalized to those of pGL3-HS and fold change of relative luciferase activity was calculated by dividing the normalized luciferase activity in pGL3-HS-ZFSs by the normalized luciferase activity of pGL3-HS-negative.3. Results and discussion3.1. Recognition of Z-DNA structure by Za and ZaaZ-DNA formation and Z-DNA recognition by Za and Zaa were examined using an in vitro cleavage assay. The Z-DNA-binding domains Za and Zaa were fused with the catalytic domain of FokI, which is a type IIS restriction endonuclease (Fig. 1A). Two fusion proteins, Za-Fok and Zaa-Fok, and Fok as a negative control were expressed and purified. A d(CG)11 insert within pDHg16 is known to form Z-DNA when the plasmid is negatively supercoiled (Fig. 1B). The in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay showed that Za-Fok and Zaa-Fok did not digest the linear form of pDHg16 (Fig. 1C, top and middle, lane 1–5), whereas they cleaved the d(CG)11 insert in the negatively supercoiled pDHg16, producing 1.4-kb and 0.8-kb DNA fragments (Fig. 1C, top and middle, lane 7–11). These results suggest that the binding of Za and Zaa is dependent on DNA conformation rather than sequence composition, which is consistent with previously reported data.7,8 As the concentration of Za-Fok was increased, the two bands produced by Za-Fok and PstI became thicker, but the increase in activity stopped when eight times more Za-Fok than pDHg16 was added (Fig. 1C, top, lane 10). Because Zaa has a higher affinity to Z-DNA than Za, the two fragments produced by Zaa-Fok and PstI formed clearer, thicker bands, and Zaa-Fok had more activity than Za-Fok, even at a 2:1 molar ratio of Zaa-Fok:pDHg16 (Fig. 1C, middle, lane 8). Contrary to Za- and Zaa-Fok, digested fragments of supercoiled pDHg16 were not shown with Fok (Fig. 1C, bottom, lane 8-12). Therefore, we confirmed that Za and Zaa were capable of recognizing and binding Z-DNA and that Zaa showed higher affinity to Z-DNA than Za.

Lane 12 (top and middle) and 14 (bottom) has the restriction fragments of ClaI and PstI.3.2. Identification of ZFSs in human genomeThe specificity of selectivity of antibody was examined. Zaa was overexpressed and localized mostly in the nucleus in HeLa cells. Confocal microscopic analysis determined that the expressed Zaa accumulated in the nuclei, confirming a high level of expression and nuclear localization of Zaa. Additionally, non-specific protein bands were not observed using FLAG antibody, indicating that the antibody is highly specific to Zaa (Fig. 2A and B). Even though some commercial antibodies against Z-DNA are available and several groups have succeeded in detecting Z-DNA in human cells,14,30 it is hard to identify sites enriched for Z-DNA-antibody binding in HeLa cells (data not shown), likely because the intensive sonication required for fragmenting chromatin may cause Z-DNA more unstable. Therefore, we used Z-DNA-binding proteins as probes for detecting Z-DNA-forming sites. ChIP-Seq experiments were performed with Zaa-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2C) and sequencing data were obtained from three biological replicates and two negative controls, IgG and Input DNA. To identify confident ZFSs, IDR framework analysis was applied to find Zaa peaks consistent between replicates. The numbers of self-consistent peaks between two pseudoreplicates were 1,024 for Zaa repl1, 520 for Zaa rep2, and 814 for Zaa rep3 (IDR = 0.01) and the number of peaks consistent between pooled-pseudoreplicates is 649 (IDR = 0.001). Additionally, the numbers of peaks consistent between pairs of Zaa replicates are 197 between rep1 and rep2, 229 between rep1 and rep3, and 427 between rep2 and rep3 (IDR = 0.05). Of these three, the maximum peak number (427) was used as a cutoff value. Top 427 Zaa peaks in pooled Zaa replicates were further processed with blacklist regions and finally 391 regions were selected as ZFSs (Supplementary Fig. S1). The list of 391 ZFSs and their surrounding genomic features is shown in Supplementary Table S3. We confirmed that the correlations of mapped reads were higher between Zaa replicate pairs than between unrelated sample pairs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The Pearson’s correlation coefficients between Zaa replicates were shown; 0.962 for rep1-rep2, 0.774 for rep1-rep3, 0.814 for rep2-rep3, 0.375 for rep1-IgG, 0.379 for rep2-IgG, and 0.342 for rep3-IgG, 0.385 for rep1-Input, 0.421 for rep2-Input, 0.295 for rep3-Input, and 0.760 for IgG-Input. The correlation coefficients are much higher between Zaa replicates than among pairs of replicate-control. As shown in the comprehensive genome-wide view of ZFSs, the overall ZFSs were distributed all over the chromosome (Fig. 2D). As examples, sequence tag distributions of replicates, input and IgG are visualized by the UCSC genome browser (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Fig. S3). Genome-wide mapping of Z-DNA using Zaa.

Validation of ZFSs by Zaa ChIP-qPCR and an in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assayIn order to validate ZFSs, the existence of predicted ZDRs in ZFSs was first examined using the Z-catcher program. The advantage of Z-catcher is that it can predict ZDRs genome-wide using different s levels which specify the superhelical density, a proxy for the energy that can cause a B-to-Z transition. About 80% and 50% of ZFSs contained more than one predicted ZDR at the cutoff of s = -0.08 and -0.07, respectively. d(CG) or d(CA/TG) repeating sequence is well known to form Z-DNA. However, little is known about the Z-DNA formation in other sequences, except for alternating repeat sequences. To compare the efficiency of Z-DNA formation between different sequences, we randomly selected 10 ZFSs for validation and then divided them into two groups based on the number of alternating purine/pyrimidine dinucleotides of predicted ZDRs: an alternating (Pu)(Py) group (= 6 dinucleotides) and a non-alternating (Pu)(Py) group (< 6 dinucleotides). Supplementary Table S4 lists the genes that were closest to each ZFS and the predicted ZDR sequence. Four negative controls were designed not to contain any Zaa peaks, 5–10 kb away from a ZFS. ChIP-qPCR found that Zaa was significantly enriched in 9 out of 10 ZFSs (90%), relative to the average of the ZFS-negative regions (P-value < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S4A, marked by cross). The control IgG had low Zaa enrichment for all ZFSs. There was little difference between the enrichment levels of Zaa in the alternating (Pu)(Py) group and the non-alternating (Pu)(Py) group, even though the predicted ZDR sequences were not identical and could not be directly compared. Among nine Zaa-enriched ZFSs (ANKRD11, ROR, SNX12, SRSF6, TFAP2A, SIK1, HIST2H2AC, STX16, and PIM3), the most enriched ZFSs by Zaa is SIK1 whose ZDR does not contain alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequences. In addition, STX16 and PIM3 also show relatively high levels of Zaa enrichment. The enrichment level of Zaa seemed not to be closely correlated with the presence of an alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequence. Presumably, alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequences might not be the only major factor required to form the Z-DNA structure in cells.We next performed an in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay to confirm whether the predicted ZDRs in ZFSs were able to form Z-DNA in a negatively supercoiled plasmid. Zaa-Fok digested 4 of the 5 predicted ZDRs in the alternating (Pu)(Py) group (pDPL6-ANKRD11, -ROR1, -SNX12, and -SRSF6; each ZDR labeled by its corresponding gene name) and 2 of the 5 predicted ZDRs in the non-alternating (Pu)(Py) group (pDPL6-SIK1 and -PIM3) (Supplementary Fig. S4B). In contrast to the supercoiled forms of the pDPL6-ZDRs, the supercoiled pDPL6-negative was not digested by Zaa-Fok. Therefore, 6 out of the 10 predicted ZDRs (60%) formed the Z-DNA structure in negatively supercoiled plasmids. The intensities of the two bands produced by Zaa-Fok digestion were quantitated (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The digestion efficiency of Zaa-Fok for each predicted ZDR had a low correlation with the enrichment level of Zaa (Supplementary Fig. S4D). For example, pDPL6-SIK1 was digested by Zaa-Fok with a similar digestion efficiency as pDPL6-SRSF6, meaning that they had sequences with similar potential to form Z-DNA in vitro. However, the ZFS in SIK1 had more Zaa enrichment than the ZFSs in SRSF6, as demonstrated by ChIP-qPCR. This difference between the in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay and the Zaa ChIP-qPCR might be caused by the ZFSs located in the chromatin context in cells. Contrary to Zaa ChIP-qPCR, only 60% of predicted ZDRs in the ZFSs were confirmed by an in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay. The remaining 40% of predicted ZDRs were not digested by Zaa-Fok probably because the ZDR sequences per se had a low potential to form Z-DNA and levels of negative supercoiling were restricted in vitro. However, the formation of DNA supercoiling in vivo is affected by chromatin structure related with biological processes so that supercoil density might dynamically change. In the presence of a high degree of negative supercoiling, Z-DNA can be formed even at ZDRs with the relatively low potential to form Z-DNA.Consequently, Z-DNA formation in cells may be affected by the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure, such as chromatin remodeling and nucleosome positioning, in addition to the sequence composition and length of the ZDRs. In summary, we confirmed that the enrichment level of Zaa was not simply determined by the existence of known alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequences in ZFSs.3.4. Characterization of genomic features of ZFSsZFSs were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of genes (46.2%), in the gene body (29.7%), and in intergenic regions (24.1%). On the other hand, only 1.5% of random peaks were present in promoter regions, and a large portion of random peaks were found in intergenic regions (57.2%; Fig. 3A). As demonstrated by the in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S4B), negative supercoiling is required to induce Z-DNA formation. Thus, ZFSs are likely to be negatively supercoiled. We analyzed the distribution of the superhelical density in and around ZFSs as well as random peaks. Because, in Z-catcher, the free energy requirement for B-to-Z transition was translated into the superhelical density (s) which provides energy for the transition, given sequences which require less supercoiling (closer to zero) have greater Z-DNA forming potentials. As shown in Fig. 3B, the superhelical density required for Z-DNA formation was lower in the centre of ZFSs than random peaks, meaning that ZFSs have concentrations of Z-DNA forming potentials. In addition, the existence of short ZDRs in 391 ZFSs was examined using the Z-catcher. Among ZFSs, 81.0% carried potential ZDRs with the cutoff of -0.08, but only 32.5% of random peaks had potential ZDRs. When the cutoff value was increased to -0.07, 50.3% of ZFSs and 10.0% of random peaks contain predicted ZDRs. However, considering the ratio of ZFS to random peak ratio in frequency at the cut off of -0.07, 5 times more ZFSs had ZDRs than random peaks (Chi-Square P-value: 1.60e-131) whereas ZFSs containing predicted ZDRs are just 2.5 times more than random peaks at the cut off of -0.08 (Chi-Square P-value: 2.88e-87, Fig. 3C). Thus, ZFSs significantly contain sequences with higher potential for forming Z-DNA than random peaks. Genomic features at ZFSs.

Letter size indicates the frequency of nucleotides.A functional association of ZFSs with gene was examined by GO analysis. As Fig. 3D is shown, Z-DNA may be involved in a wide variety of biological processes such as nucleosome assembly, translation, cellular macromolecular complex subunit organization, translational elongation, and the regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters, etc. Some studies have reported that transcription factors and remodeling complexes need Z-DNA-forming sequences to bind DNA.15,16 Based on this, we hypothesized that known and unknown factors are binding within ZFSs. We analyzed the ZFSs for transcription factor binding motifs. As shown in Fig. 3E, the NRF motif is the most enriched motif in ZFSs. In addition, there are other transcription factor binding motifs for ARNT and ELK4. These proteins are interesting candidates for follow-up studies on the association of Z-DNA to transcription. According to the result of de novo motif analysis, about 40% of ZFSs contained alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequences which were not found in the remaining ZFSs (Supplementary Fig. S5). This result is also consistent with the Zaa ChIP-qPCR assay; alternating purine/pyrimidine repeat sequences might not be the only major factor required to form the Z-DNA structure in cells.Negative supercoils are generated behind RNA polymerase II as it moves along the DNA strand and during the nucleosome remodelling.31,32 Furthermore, negative supercoiling is found in open chromatin regions, which contain actively transcribed genes.33,34 Z-DNA is known to be stabilized by negative supercoiling, as determined in vivo. Our experiments demonstrating that Zaa-Fok digests predicted ZDRs in a negatively supercoiled plasmid and that ZFSs have high potential to form Z-DNA also support the assertion that Z-DNA can form during negative supercoiling. Moreover, we found a large portion of ZFSs were located in promoter regions. All of these results suggest the possibility that the Z-DNA formation is related to active transcription.Recently, it has been reported that false-positive signals from ChIP-seq could be caused by artefacts and biases inherent in the ChIP-seq procedures such as batch-to-batch variation in sonication efficiency, cross-reactivity of antibodies with non-specific proteins, differential chromatin accessibility, and so on.35,36 Even though input and IgG controls are used, artificially high ChIP signals cannot be fully removed. However, most Zaa peaks (91%) were not overlapped with ultra-high signal artefact regions (data not shown), which suggests that Zaa peaks are reliable to find a biological function of Z-DNA.3.5. Differences of distribution of ZFSs and Z-DNA hotspotsZ-DNA hotspots found by ChAP and cloning, followed by Sanger sequencing, has been reported that they were mainly found in centromeres and telomeres.12 Because many of our ZFSs were detected in the promoter regions of human genes and Zaa enrichment in several Z-DNA hotspots was not observed in our Zaa ChIP-qPCR data, we further examined this discrepancy. Out of 186 Z-DNA hotspots, only 6 Zaa peaks were colocalized with Z-DNA hotspots (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Notably, our input and IgG also showed strong read enrichment in Z-DNA hotspots (Supplementary Fig. S6B).There are four possible implications of such differences; First, different methods were used for detecting Z-DNA in human cells. Li et al. used dual cross-linking ChAP followed by cloning and Sanger sequencing. Because this method has less coverage than ChIP-Seq, it is possible that Za-binding regions were only locally mapped, which might not give enough information for identifying the role of Z-DNA. Second, they applied purified Za to fixed and permeabilized cells and then cross-linked Za to DNA. This strategy might result in identifying Z-DNA formed in other genomic locations than the locations found in our approach. Third, different constructs were used to detect Z-DNA. Since Zaa more strongly and specifically binds to Z-DNA than Za, different maps of Z-DNA forming sites might be generated by Za and Zaa. Finally, different cell lines were used. Different cells have different characteristics, and Z-DNA locations may be associated with different biological processes. Future studies are needed to find Z-DNA-forming sites and to compare the biological functions of Z-DNA in different cells using each method.3.6. Association of ZFSs with active transcriptionTo examine the relationship between Z-DNA and transcription, the expression levels of genes associated with ZFSs were analyzed. Higher gene expression was observed in genes with ZFS at their promoter than in the gene body (Mann-Whitney U test P-values for promoter vs. gene body, total genes vs. gene body, and total genes vs. promoter are 2.201e-03, 4.322e-06, and < 2.2e-16, respectively. Fig. 4A). Genes were divided into three groups (‘top’, ‘mid’, and ‘bottom’) according to their expression levels and normalized read counts in ZFSs for each Zaa replicate were plotted depending on the gene expression level. The reads mapped in ZFSs were highly enriched in the ‘top’ gene group, especially at the TSSs (Fig. 4B). The same pattern is also shown in other two Zaa replicates (Supplementary Fig. S7). Next, we investigated whether ZFSs are associated with RNA polymerase II deposition. RNA polymerase II ChIP-Seq data generated from three different data sets (Pol II-1, Pol II-2, and Pol II-3) were analyzed. Among the 391 ZFSs, 231 ZFSs (59%) overlapped with the RNA polymerase II peaks (P-value < 1.0E-05, Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary Table S5). ZFSs were substantially correlated with RNA polymerase II binding sites, as shown in the Circos diagram and an example region in chromosome 1 (Fig. 2D). Additionally, the association of ZFSs with RNA polymerase II binding sites was experimentally validated in the top seven genes, which had been selected according to Zaa enrichment in the Zaa ChIP-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S4A). First, as the binding of RNA polymerase II at Zaa peaks was examined in all seven ZFSs via the UCSC genome browser, and the position of RNA polymerase II was overlapped with most ZFSs (Supplementary Fig. S8A). By ChIP-qPCR, RNA polymerase II mostly showed significant enrichment near selected ZFSs (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Therefore, these results confirm that Z-DNA formation is strongly correlated with active transcription. Association of ZFSs with active transcriptional regions. (A) Gene expression analysis was performed. Public mRNA sequencing data were downloaded and mapped to the human reference genome. Each transcript was quantified and normalized using the RPKM (reads per kilobase per million). ‘Promoter’ or ‘Gene body’ indicates where the genes have the ZFS. (B) Genes were ranked based on their RPKM values and divided into three groups based on their expression: top (1,000 highest expressing genes, thick line), mid (1,000 genes between the top and bottom group, dashed line), bottom (6,661 unexpressed genes (RPKM = 0), dotted line). Reads of each Zaa replicate were normalized by Read count per million mapped reads and normalized reads were counted within 5 kb of the TSSs. Shaded regions indicate P-value < 0.05.

In promoter regions of actively transcribed genes, Z-DNA is associated with RNA polymerase II and active histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac.Association of ZFSs with active transcriptional regions.

In promoter regions of actively transcribed genes, Z-DNA is associated with RNA polymerase II and active histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac.As the chromatin structure has been suggested to be one of the important factors in Z-DNA formation and our Zaa ChIP-qPCR and the in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay implied the involvement of other factors than nucleotide composition, we tested if specific epigenetic marks were associated with Z-DNA by analyzing histone ChIP-Seq data. Zaa-enriched regions were strongly correlated with the accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, which are mainly found in the promoter and enhancer regions of actively transcribed genes. On the other hand, Zaa-enriched regions were not associated with the histone marks H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K79me3, which are largely in the gene body or are repressive modifications. Moreover, the enrichment of RNA polymerase II was again found in Zaa-enriched regions (Fig. 4C).The association of Z-DNA formation with active transcription was further examined by luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Supplementary Figure S9, 90% ZFSs (9/10) showed significantly increased luciferase reporter activities relative to the negative control, supporting a positive correlation between Z-DNA formation and transcriptional activation. Collectively, it is evident that the Z-DNA formation is tightly linked with the open chromatin structure of active transcription. Z-DNA is formed near the TSS of actively transcribed genes, with RNA polymerase II and active histone marks located in the promoter regions and, importantly, Z-DNA formation might play a crucial role in activating transcription (Fig. 4D).3.7. ConclusionZ-DNA is one of the most well studied non-B-DNA structures, and in vivo and in vitro formation of Z-DNA has been reported in many studies. However, the general biological function of Z-DNA in human cells has not been well elucidated because only a few studies have investigated the genome-wide distribution of Z-DNA-forming sites. Using Zaa as a probe, we identified highly confident 391 ZFSs genome-wide in HeLa cells with ChIP-seq. The majority of 10 ZFSs was validated by Zaa ChIP-qPCR and an in vitro Z-DNA cleavage assay. We found that ZFSs are mostly located in promoter regions and contain sequences with the highest potential to form Z-DNA. ZFSs are significantly associated with highly expressed genes and have an enrichment of RNA polymerase II binding. In addition, active histone marks were significantly correlated with Z-DNA formation, meaning that Z-DNA formation in cells relies not only on sequence composition, but also on chromatin structure. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Z-DNA formation might transcriptionally activate genes. These results suggest that there is a strong correlation between Z-DNA formation and active transcription.This ZFS mapping information could be useful for identifying disease genes whose expression can be altered if Z-DNA formation can be regulated by drugs such as inhibitors of epigenetic regulators, topoisomerase inhibitor, or other reagents that release negative supercoils.Conflic of InterestNone declaredAccession numberThe accession number of ChIP-Seq data is GSE71682.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the National Research Foundation of Korea (2015M3A9B4051044, 2010-0020259 and 2015048159, and 2014M3C9A3064548 to TYR), the POSTECH BSRI research fund (to TYR), and the BK21 PLUS fellowship program funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea (G16CN40T1201 to SIS, JP, SH, SHS, CHL and HJ).

IntroductionLegumes are important in both agricultural and natural ecosystems because of their capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and many are rich sources of protein.1,2 The legume Lotus japonicus has been extensively used as a model for deciphering the molecular genetics governing the symbiotic interaction with rhizobia.3,4 Comprehensive genetic and genomic resources have been developed in L. japonicus, including bacterial artificial chromosome libraries,5,6 a LORE1 mutant population,7,8 a TILLING population,9 ESTs,6,10 genetic and physical maps,11–14 and recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations.14–17So far, L. japonicus genetic maps have been based on low-resolution simple sequence repeat (SSR) genotyping of F2 (~900 markers) and RIL populations (~96 markers).14,17 These maps have proved useful for anchoring large contigs to pseudomolecules13 and for QTL mapping,14,17 but both approaches have been limited by the low marker densities of the SSR-based maps. The resolution of a genetic map depends on the number of recombination events in the mapping population and on the number of markers used to genotype each individual. The recombination breakpoint positions in the current L. japonicus maps are determined with limited accuracy due to the low marker density. With advances in sequencing technology, it has now become possible to genotype all single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) positions in RIL populations using whole-genome re-sequencing. SNP genotyping using various methods has been successfully used in other plant species. In soybean and Medicago sativa, genetic maps were generated by genotyping ~3,000 SNPs,18,19 in chickpea ~2–4,000 SNPs were used,20 whereas 16,000 single feature polymorphisms were used to generate a genetic map with 815 recombination breakpoints in Arabidopsis.21 In Brassica rapa more than 1 million SNPs were discovered in 150 RILs using whole-genome re-sequencing, and a genetic map with 2,305 recombination events was constructed.22 Similarly, a high-density genetic map with 5,074 breakpoints was generated in rice using low-coverage re-sequencing of 150 RILs.23The choice of crossing partners and the population size is important for generation of high-quality genetic maps. The F2 populations developed earlier using Gifu as the common parent in crosses with Funakura or L. filicaulis12,15 suffered drawbacks including low levels of polymorphism, low viability, severe segregation distortion and recombination suppression.12,16 Although the MG-20 × Gifu cross has advantages in terms of good viability with little segregation distortion and a reasonable marker density,11,13,24 it has the disadvantage that a large reciprocal translocation between the top of Gifu chromosome 1 and the bottom of MG-20 chromosome 2 causes severe suppression of recombination in this genomic region.11In order to overcome the problems with suppression of recombination in the MG-20 × Gifu cross and to increase genetic variation and marker density, a more divergent accession originating from West Pakistan, Lotus burttii,25,26 was used for bi-parental crossing with Gifu. F2 populations derived from this cross showed good viability and did not suffer from suppression of recombination at the top of chromosome 1,24 and a genetic map based on genotyping 97 SSR markers in 146 RILs has been constructed.14Here, we have genotyped 187 MG-20 × Gifu and 96 Gifu × L. burttii RILs using whole-genome re-sequencing to accurately identify recombination breakpoints and construct high-resolution genetic maps for both crosses. These maps now facilitate identification of reference genome mis-assemblies, assignment of unanchored contigs onto pseudomolecules, and mapping of genomic translocations with high accuracy.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing and read alignmentDNA from 187 MG-20 × Gifu (F9) and 96 RILs of Gifu × L. burttii (F8) RILs developed from F2 populations by single seed descent11,14 was extracted using the CTAB protocol.27 Sequencing libraries were then constructed using the Illumina Nextera DNA library preparation kit (FC-121-1031) with a dual-index adapter system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer to generate 2×93 bp paired-end reads from ~500 bp insert libraries. The reads were mapped to the MG-20 L. japonicus genome v.3.0 (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/, 17 June 2016, date last accessed) using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner mem v. 0.7 with default parameters .5a.282.2. Genetic map constructionCandidate polymorphic positions were available from genome sequences, and these were validated by verifying that the positions were polymorphic according to the RIL genotyping results. The candidate SNP markers were genotyped using the mpileup function of SAMtools software v0.1.19.29 The command used to determine genotypes was samtools mpileup –uD –b <List of BAM files.txt> –f <reference_genome.fasta> –I <Known Polymorphic positions.txt> | samtools bcftools view –cg - > result.vcf’, where –u is to generate uncompressed binary variant call format (BCF) output, -D is to output per sample depth. Because the reads were mapped to an MG-20 reference sequence, the Gifu × L. burttii RIL genotype calls were re-oriented with reference to Gifu, such that the Gifu, rather than the MG-20, genotype was considered the reference allele.To generate genetic maps, we used a modified version of a previously described approach.23 Because of the higher sequencing depth used in our study, we simplified the sliding window approach for calling genotype blocks, using overlapping windows with a single base offset spanning 20 markers upstream and downstream of each marker position. Genotype counts were calculated for each window, and the consensus genotype was called as the genotype with the highest abundance. Recombination breakpoints were then called at positions where the consensus genotype switched (Fig. 2B). To ensure better accuracy, the genotype block calls were compared with the original genotyping data at each marker position for each RIL and a score was calculated. The score was +1 if the genotype block call and marker genotypes matched, 0 if there was a mismatch, and +0.5 if one of the genotypes was heterozygous. This marker score was used to identify inaccurate breakpoint positions, where the breakpoint had been miscalled by a few marker positions relative to its true position. Inaccurate breakpoint positions were then shifted to optimize the marker score. For the MG-20 × Gifu data, the marker score was additionally used for filtering out markers that showed poor concordance with the genotype block calls. Markers were removed if the cumulative score at each marker position was <150. Finally, breakpoints that occurred at the same position in the majority of the RILs were removed manually because these very likely represented artifacts. In order to construct a genetic segment map for each of the RIL populations, the region between any two consecutive breakpoints in all RILs for each population was defined as one segment.232.3. Identification of translocations and assembly errors based on the Gifu × L. burttii genetic mapFor the MG-20 × Gifu RILs, the segment map did not require any filtering, but for Gifu × L. burttii, a large number of aberrant segments were apparent (Fig. 3B). Although the complex segment pattern presented was difficult to resolve accurately using automated approaches, we identified aberrant segments with high confidence by manual curation of the segment map, where the dominant genotype pattern for each genomic region was readily apparent and the aberrant segments stood out because of large deviations from the consensus genotype pattern. Next, the aberrant segments that were <10 kb were discarded in order to focus on the largest and most well-supported segments. Each of the remaining aberrant segments was then matched with all other segments using a custom perl script to determine the genetic linkage. If =90 out of the 96 RIL genotypes were identical between two segments, then the aberrant segment was placed next to the matching segment, identifying it is misplaced in the original map. Unplaced aberrant segments were not included in the genetic map.The displaced segments were then categorized as translocations or assembly errors. The RIL genotypes of the displaced segment in the Gifu × L. burttii map were compared with the MG-20 × Gifu RIL genotypes in the same genomic region by manual inspection. If the region in MG-20 × Gifu showed markers with discordant genotypes compared with neighboring regions, then the segment in Gifu × L. burttii was classified as an assembly error. In contrast, if the genotypes of the markers in the region matched the flanking markers, the segment was categorized as a translocation. The genetic maps were visualized by calculating pairwise logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores and recombination fractions using the plot.rf function of the R/qtl package.303. Results and discussion3.1. RIL re-sequencing and genotypingPaired-end sequencing reads from 187 MG-20 × Gifu and 96 Gifu × L. burttii RILs were aligned to the L. japonicus MG-20 reference genome v. 3.0 using bwa. The resulting average coverage was 6.53 for the MG20 × Gifu RILs and 8.03 for the Gifu × L. burttii RILs (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Next, 87,140 positions polymorphic between Gifu and MG-20, and 357,973 positions polymorphic between Gifu and L. burttii were genotyped in the two sets of RILs on chromosomes 1–6 (Supplementary Files S1–S2). With ~230 Mbp sequence anchored on these pseudomolecules, this yields average marker distances of 2.6 and 0.64 kbp in the two maps, allowing high-resolution mapping of recombination breakpoints. In addition, 64,011 positions polymorphic between MG-20 and Gifu and 203,540 positions polymorphic between Gifu and L. burttii were genotyped on 162 Mbp of unanchored contigs (chr0) (Supplementary Files S3–S4) in L. japonicus v 3.0. This genotype information can now be used to position chr0 contigs onto the L. japonicus v. 3.0 pseudomolecules.

Identification of RIL genotype blocks and construction of genetic mapsBecause recombination events are relatively infrequent,23 we expected to identify large genotype blocks based on the genotyping data. These blocks were apparent, but they were frequently interrupted by aberrant genotype calls (Fig. 2A). This noise could be due to genotyping errors or to misplaced markers, and we used a sliding window approach to reduce the noise by calling consensus genotypes within 41-marker sliding windows (Fig. 2B). In addition, we eliminated small blocks of markers, which showed very poor consistency in genotype calls with those of their neighbors (Supplementary Files S5–S6). Genotype block calling.

(A) Unfiltered genotype cells and (B) Final genotype blocks.Following identification of genotype blocks for all RILs, we combined the results into genetic maps, where each segment constituted the region between any two consecutive breakpoints in the RIL population.23 To visualize the resulting maps, we then plotted the pairwise recombination fractions and LOD scores for all segments (Fig. 3). The MG-20 × Gifu map contained 1,744 segments and appeared very consistent with previous results,11,12 with the strongest linkage along the diagonal and at the site of the Gifu – MG-20 chromosome 1–2 translocation (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, with 1,837 detected breakpoints, the Gifu × L. burttii map contained many more segments than expected for 96 RILs, and large numbers of aberrant linkage signals were apparent as numerous inconsistent horizontal and vertical lines in the LOD score and recombination fraction plot (Fig. 3B).

Identification of assembly errors and correction of the Gifu × L. burttii mapBecause all reads were aligned to the MG-20 reference genome, the inconsistencies in the Gifu × L. burttii map could be caused either by assembly errors in the MG-20 reference sequence being detected because of the fourfold larger marker density in the Gifu × L. burttii cross or by the occurrence of translocations specific to MG-20. To distinguish between these possibilities, we returned to the unfiltered MG-20 × Gifu genotyping results (Supplementary File S1) and investigated the genotype consistencies in the aberrant regions identified in the Gifu × L. burttii map. In 179 out of 347 cases, we found markers within the same intervals in the MG-20 × Gifu map, which had been filtered away because of genotype inconsistency with neighboring markers, identifying these intervals as misplaced in the MG-20 reference assembly. This genetic information has potential for improving the quality of the reference genome assembly because an average marker distance of only 0.6 kbp in the Gifu × L. burttii map would reliably detect misplaced contigs with sizes down to a few kilobasepair.We then proceeded to replace the aberrant segments in the Gifu × L. burttii map based on their genotype patterns, and we were able to unambiguously assign 201 out of 347 regions, resulting in a consistent map comprising 1,044 segments (Fig. 3C, Table 1) Finally, the reciprocally translocated regions at the top of chromosome 1 and bottom of chromosome 2 were replaced to align the segment map with the genetic data (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table S4, Supplementary File S4). Summary of replaced segments in the Gifu × L. burttii segment mapThe segments were moved from the chromosome indicated in the header row to the chromosome indicated in the leftmost column.Summary of replaced segments in the Gifu × L. burttii segment mapThe segments were moved from the chromosome indicated in the header row to the chromosome indicated in the leftmost column.3.4. Segregation distortion and breakpoint distributionAfter establishing the genetic maps for both crosses, we characterized segregation distortion patterns. Although the MG-20 × Gifu population was well balanced, we observed more severe biases in the Gifu × L. burttii RILs. The most striking signal was found on chromosome 2 with a maxium at ~25 Mbp. Here, the L. burttii allele frequency reached 96% (Fig. 4), indicating very strong selection against Gifu alleles resulting in elimination of 50% of the possible progeny due to this incompatibility alone. Segregation distortion. The Gifu genotype fractions for MG-20 × Gifu and Gifu × Lotus burttii are plotted for each segment in the genetic maps. The positions are relative to the MG-20 v. 3.0 reference sequence.Segregation distortion. The Gifu genotype fractions for MG-20 × Gifu and Gifu × Lotus burttii are plotted for each segment in the genetic maps. The positions are relative to the MG-20 v. 3.0 reference sequence.Both crosses showed very similar averages of 10.3 breakpoints per chromosome (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S2), and the genetic length of each chromosome corresponded to the previous genetic linkage map11 (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, the breakpoints and overall genotype patterns detected in the MG-20 × Gifu RILs corresponded well with previous genotype data generated using SSR markers,17 with the exception of seven lines, RI-011, RI-068, RI-080, RI-097, RI-149, RI-152 and RI-153, where the line identities may have been interchanged.

Both crosses showed a reduced recombination frequency at the top of chromosome 2, which corresponds to a region rich in ribosomal RNA genes,31 and near the centromere on chromosome 4.

The horizontal bars indicate regions of recombination suppression. All breakpoint positions are shown relative to the MG-20 v.3.0 reference sequence.3.5. Mapping of MG-20-specific structural variantsBecause suppression of recombination can be a consequence of structural rearrangements and because a major reciprocal chromosomal translocation has occurred between chromosomes 1 and 2 in MG-20 with respect to Gifu and L. burttii,11,26 we returned to the aberrant segments in the Gifu × L. burttii map in order to precisely characterize the structural variation between MG-20 and Gifu/L. burttii. Only two aberrant segments were found in regions, which contained consistent marker genotypes in the MG-20 × Gifu population (Supplementary Fig. S1). These segments corresponded to the regions displaying suppressed recombination in the MG-20 × Gifu cross, the top of chromosome 1 and a region around 20 Mbp on chromosome 6, indicating that they likely represented structural variants (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. S1).Examining first the top of chromosome 1 and the chromosome 1–2 reciprocal translocation, we could accurately map the translocation breakpoints to between 1,730 and 1,806 kbp on chromosome 1 (Fig. 7A) and between 32,017 kbp and 32,645 kbp on chromosome 2 (Fig. 7C) using the Gifu × L. burttii map. A number of putative structural rearrangements were also detected within this translocated region based on the Gifu × L. burttii data, but these were all classified as assembly errors and were mostly caused by errors in scaffolding, as the aberrant segments corresponded to entire contigs created by short read assembly.

Although there was no indication of a larger inversion, it appeared that this smaller translocation could be causing the suppression of recombination in the region around 20 Mbp (Fig. 6), which was also observed in the existing genetic map of an MG-20 × Gifu F2 population, where more than 10 markers mapped to 46.6 cM, corresponding to the same region.13In conclusion, the two high-density genetic maps are complementary and together provide adequate coverage of the L. japonicus genome for QTL mapping and genome assembly, and the very high marker density generated by whole-genome re-sequencing of the Gifu × L. burttii RILs is especially useful for identifying and correcting even minor reference genome mis-assemblies.4.

IntroductionHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the tick-borne pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis.1 HME is considered an emerging infectious disease in the USA and is also reported from several other parts of the world.2 HME is an acute flu-like illness with symptoms including fever, headache, myalgia, anorexia and chills and is frequently accompanied by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and upgraded levels of serum hepatic aminotransferases.3 Similarly, several other Anaplasmataceae family pathogens, including the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, have been identified in recent years as the causative agents of important emerging diseases in people and various vertebrate animals.3–5 The limited availability of genetic tools to study obligate intra-phagosomal pathogens impacted our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and the pathogen’s prolonged persistence in vertebrate and tick hosts.6–8 Host-specific differences in the gene expression of E. chaffeensis are also reported,9,10 but it is entirely unknown how the organism accomplishes such changes in gene expression.Transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes is accomplished by the action of RNAP holoenzyme. RNAP holoenzyme is a multi-protein complex composed of two alpha (a) subunits, two beta (ß) subunits and a sigma (s) factor.11 Promoter specificity for an RNAP is accomplished by the inclusion of a sigma factor. Ehrlichia chaffeensis genome contains only two sigma factor genes; rpoD (ECH_0760) (the predicted primary housekeeping s70 gene) and rpoH (ECH_0655) (the predicted alternate s32 gene) (GenBank # NC_007799.1).1 Both s32 and s70 are conserved in most proteobacteria and share extensive similarity at the amino acid level.12 Transcription from a gene promoter by an RNAP typically involves the recognition of and binding to two DNA motifs located upstream from the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene; the motifs -10 and -35, which is a common occurrence for many bacteria.13,14 The -10 motif interacts with the 2.3–2.4 region of a s70 to bind RNA polymerase,15–19 while the -35 motif is known to interact with the conserved 4.2 region.20–22 Recent studies in Escherichia coli suggest that the spacer sequences located between the -35 and -10 motifs also contribute to transcription initiation and regulation.23–25We recently mapped the promoters of several E. chaffeensis genes by performing in vitro transcription studies using the RNAP containing recombinant E. chaffeensis sigma factors.26,27 RNA polymerase binding motifs of E. chaffeensis gene promoters are highly homologous for its only two sigma factors, s32 and s70. The gene expression in this bacterium can also be accomplished by either of the two factors, but with varying affinities for different gene promoters.27 We reported that the E. chaffeensis outer membrane protein genes encoding for p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 proteins (Ech_1136 and Ech_1143, respectively) are transcribed predominantly by s70. Our initial studies revealed that only the -35 motifs, but not -10 motifs, are required for transcription for these two genes.26 The transcriptional assessment of E. chaffeensis genes requires additional investigations to define the contributions of the pathogen sigma factors for RNAP function, as prior studies were carried out with E. coli RNAP. Such studies are a challenge due to the lack of appropriate molecular tools for this organism.Most of the current knowledge of bacterial gene regulation comes from studying the gene regulation of E. coli. Such knowledge is severely limited for other Gram-negative bacteria and more importantly, it is unclear how intracellular pathogens, such as E. chaffeensis, regulate gene expression to overcome the host stress. In the current study, we developed an E. coli-based promoter mapping system to study functions of two genes and validated the data using the in vitro transcription system. We took advantage of a previously developed E. coli strain in which the endogenous rpoD gene expression is controlled by the repressible trp promoter.28 In this E. coli, we complemented E. chaffeensis s70 after suppressing its native s70. This system was then used to systematically map sequence determinants spanning from the -10 to -35 motifs of two differentially expressed genes recognized primarily by E. chaffeensis s70. Together, the study allowed us to test the function of E. chaffeensis s70 and its ability to regulate target genes. In view of the lack of a transformation system in E. chaffeensis and in other related tick-borne intracellular rickettsial pathogens, the assessment of Ehrlichia transcriptional machinery in the surrogate E. coli system along with the validation experiments carried out by in vitro transcription assays offer innovative means in studying gene expression in E. chaffeensis and other important intracellular rickettsial pathogens belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family.2. Materials and methods2.1. Escherichia coli strains and plasmidsEscherichia coli strains used in this study were TOP10 (Invitrogen Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), BL21(DE3) (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and CAG20177.28,29 Several plasmid constructs used in this study were obtained from a commercial source or modified from one or more of the existing plasmids. They include pET32a (Novagen) and the derivatives of pSAKT32,30 pQF50K30 and pMT504.31 Genetic makeup of the plasmids described in this study was included in Supplementary Table S1, except those obtained from a commercial source. The plasmid pSAKT32 containing a p15A origin of replication and an ampicillin resistance gene has E. coli rpoH gene under the control of IPTG inducible Plac promoter.30 The E. coli rpoH from this plasmid was replaced with the E. chaffeensis rpoD (Ech_rpoD) gene by digesting the plasmid with Afl II and Sal I, blunt ending the digested fragments with Klenow DNA polymerase (BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), and then ligating with the Ech_rpoD sequence. Ech_rpoD segment was generated by PCR from plasmid pET32-Ech_rpoD32 using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The modified plasmid is referred to as the pSAKT32-Ech_rpoD. Ehrlichia chaffeensis rpoD variants with substitutions within the 4.2 region of s70 were constructed by mutagenesis using a QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). Ehrlichia chaffeensis rpoD variant with deletion of 1.1 region of s70 was also generated in it by using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolab, Inc, Ipswich, MA). The names of the modified pSAKT32-Ech_rpoD are provided in Supplementary Table S1.The pQF50K plasmid with a pMB1 origin of replication and with a kanamycin resistance gene contains the ß-galactosidase coding sequence (lacZ) driven by E. coli groE promoter.30 The groE promoter in the plasmid was replaced with E. chaffeensis p28-Omp14 or p28-Omp19 gene promoters by employing directional cloning by taking advantage of existing restriction sites with the plasmid surrounding the insertion. The E. chaffeensis promoter segments were generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The promoter plasmids are referred to as pQF50K-p28-Omp14 and pQF50K-p28-Omp19, respectively. Mutations with deletion of -10 or -35 motifs of the promoters were generated from these plasmids using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolab, Inc, Ipswich, MA). Site directed mutagenesis at every nucleotide of the -35 motif of the promoters was also generated from the plasmids using the Quick-change Multisite Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). Mutations to modify the AT rich spacer sequence of the p28-Omp14 promoter were generated by modifying the pQF50K-p28-Omp14 plasmid using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. The names of all engineered plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were described in the Supplementary Table S2.The expression plasmids of E. chaffeensis wild-type (WT) s70 or its variants were constructed for preparing purified recombinant proteins using the E. chaffeensis s70 plasmid reported earlier.32Ehrlichia chaffeensis s70 variants within the 4.2 region of E. chaffeensis s70 were constructed by modifying the plasmid pET32a-Ech_rpoD by using a QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA) and the modified expression constructs were then used to prepare modified recombinant proteins. The names of the modified pET32-Ech_rpoD are provided in Supplementary Table S1.For in vitro transcription analysis, E. chaffeensis promoter segments of p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 or their mutants were cloned in front of the G-less casette of pMT504 plasmid at the EcoR V site to serve as transcription templates.31 The constructs with various mutations at -35 motif for the p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 promoters were generated by PCR using the -35 motif mutant-specific plasmids in pQF50K as the templates from the respective gene promoter plasmids. The lengths of transcripts for the various promoter segments of p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 genes are 162 nucleotides. Integrity of all cloned segments in the plasmid constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis using CEQ 8000 Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).2.2. Escherichia coli growth conditions and ß-galactosidase assaysThe CAG20177 E. coli strain alone or with the recombinant plasmids was grown as described earlier.28 Briefly, cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani medium with chloramphenicol (30 µg/ml) plus indole-3-acrylic acid (IAA) (0.2 mM) to maintain expression of endogenous s70. To express E. chaffeensis s70 from plasmid pSKAT32-Ech_rpoD or its derivatives, E. coli CAG20177 strain containing the plasmid were grown with ampicillin overnight along with the IAA and chloramphenicol then diluted 1:100 into a fresh medium containing the same antibiotics, but without IAA to suppress the E. coli s70 and to induce the expression of WT E. chaffeensis s70 or its derivatives. Due to the leaky expression from the lac promoter, E. chaffeensis s70 expression was adequate to sustain the bacterial growth in the absence of IPTG. Accordingly, all experiments were carried out without adding IPTG. To assess the functions and impact of various mutations within the promoter regions of genes encoding p28-Omp14 and 19, pQF50K plasmid containing the promoter segments were maintained by growing the E. coli cultures with the addition of kanamycin. The ß-galactosidase assays were performed on the lysates prepared from the cultures grown until the OD at 600 nm reached to ~0.6 using a ß-gal assay kit (Invitrogen Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The experiments were performed thrice with independently grown cultures; specific activity of ß-galactosidase was calculated as outlined in the kit protocol.2.3. In vitro transcription assaysIn vitro transcription reactions were performed in 10 µl reaction mixture containing 0.13 pmol each of the supercoiled plasmid DNA as the template and using RNAP holoenzyme containing either recombinant E. chaffeensis s70or its derivatives.32 The holoenzyme was prepared by mixing 0.5 µl of 1:10 diluted stock of E. coli core enzyme (Epicentre, Madison, WI) mixed with 10-fold molar excess of purified recombinant E. chaffeensis s70or its derivatives and kept in ice for 30 min prior to using for the reactions. The transcription reactions were performed at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reactions were terminated by adding 7 µl of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol). Six microliters each of the samples were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel with 7 M urea, then gels were transferred to a Whatman paper, dried and 162 nucleotide transcripts were visualized by exposing an X-ray film to the gels. The transcripts were quantified using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).2.4. Native PAGE analysisThe DNA promoter segments of p28-Omp14 gene (222 bp) which included the AT-rich spacer (WT) or the modified spacers were generated by PCR from the p28-Omp14 gene. The modified derivatives of the spacer containing complementary sequence (SP1), GC-rich spacer (SP2), or the p28-Omp19 gene spacer inserted in place of the p28-Omp14 spacer (SP3) cloned in plasmid pQF50K were used as templates for amplification using the primers, Gene14-up and Gene14-down (Supplementary Table S2). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer on a non-denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel. The DNA in the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination and images captured using KODAK 1D Image Analysis system.2.5. Modelling of DNA fragments in silicoThe spacer sequence DNA segments (WT, SP1, SP2 and SP3) described above were assessed computationally using the online software, ‘model.it’ (http://hydra.icgeb.trieste.it/dna/model_it.html) using the parameter ‘Electrophoresis (dinucleotide)’ to predict the DNA structure. The resulting predicted structures were downloaded to pdb format and PyMOL was used to prepare figures.2.6. Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-test, and a P-value <0.05 was considered significant. P-values between 0.05 and 0.01 are identified with a single asterisk and P-value <0.01 are identified with double asterisks.3. Results3.1. Ehrlichia chaffeensis genes encoding for the p28-Omp14 and 19 proteins recognized by s70 require the -35 motif, but not -10 motif, for transcriptionOur prior studies demonstrated that the -35 motif, but not the -10 motif, is critical to E. chaffeensis promoter activity.26 That study was carried out using the E. coli s70 containing RNAP holoenzyme and thus the data may not be a true reflection of the outcome from the RNAP of the pathogen. To validate the data, we developed an E. coli surrogate system expressing E. chaffeensis s70 by taking advantage of a previously described E. coli strain (CAG20177) in which the endogenous s70 gene (rpoD) expression is controlled by the repressible trp promoter.28 In particular, the expression of chromosomally encoded E. coli s70 requires IAA for optimal growth, as it relieves the tryptophan repression (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the absence of IAA, the E. coli growth is significantly inhibited (e.g. ~6-fold difference between the cultures with IAA or without IAA at 3 h). The inhibition was also significantly releaved when complemented by another related s70, as we observed with the introduction of the plasmid expressing the E. chaffeensis s70 gene (Ech-rpoD) from the lac promoter in the presence of IPTG (Supplementary Fig. S1). This modified E. coli expressing Ech-rpoD is then used for studying the pathogen gene promoters. We used this E. coli system to map promoters of two E. chaffeensis genes; Ech_1136 and Ech_1143 encoding for the proteins p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19, respectively. These genes were previously identified as transcribed by the E. chaffeensis s70.32 These gene promoter segments, cloned in front of a reporter gene for ß-galactosidase in a plasmid, were used to transform the modified CAG20177 strain of E. coli (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our initial experiments in media lacking IAA tested to assess differences in transcription with or without the induction of E. chaffeensis s70 by IPTG (Supplementary Fig. S3). As the ß-galactosidase activity is also observed for the induced bacteria that is not significantly different from the non-induced, due to the leaky expression from lac promoter,28 all subsequent assessments were carried out without adding IPTG to the culture media. The p28-Omp19 gene promoter induced ~3-fold more ß-galactosidase compared with that found for the promoter of p28-Omp14 (Fig. 1). The complete deletion of -35 motifs from promoters of the genes encoding p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 caused a 40% and 80% reduction of the promoter activity, respectively (P =0.005), while deletion of -10 motifs from these two promoters resulted in non-signifant change (Fig. 1). Importance of -10 and -35 motifs of two Ehrlichia chaffeensis gene promoters assessed in the surrogate system of E. coli strain CAG20177. The ß-galactosidase expression, driven by E. chaffeensis p28-Omp14 (A) or p28-Omp19 (B) gene promoters or from the promoters containing deletion mutations at -10 and -35, was assessed relative to no promoter controls. (Constructs; NP, no promoter; WT, wild-type promoter; 14P-10 and 19P-10 represent deletions at -10 motifs and 14P-35 and 19P-35 refer to deletion constructs with -35 motif deletions.) Significant changes in the ß-galactosidase activity were identified compared with the data observed for the WT constructs.

The ß-galactosidase expression, driven by E. chaffeensis p28-Omp14 (A) or p28-Omp19 (B) gene promoters or from the promoters containing deletion mutations at -10 and -35, was assessed relative to no promoter controls. (Constructs; NP, no promoter; WT, wild-type promoter; 14P-10 and 19P-10 represent deletions at -10 motifs and 14P-35 and 19P-35 refer to deletion constructs with -35 motif deletions.) Significant changes in the ß-galactosidase activity were identified compared with the data observed for the WT constructs. 3.2. Identifying the critical sequence determinants of -35 motifs in E. chaffeensis genes recognized by s70The -35 motifs are extensively conserved for E. chaffeensis genes; its consensus sequence is TTGWNW.27 Further, this motif is identical for p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 genes (TTGCTT) (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To define the critical sequence determinants for the promoter activity, substitutions at each base of the six nucleotide motifs were made in the p28-Omp14 and 19 gene promoters and the impact of mutations was assessed by changes in the ß-galactosidase expression with E. chaffeensis s70 in the E. coli surrogate system (Fig. 2A and B). For each base pair substitution, the combination of letters and numbers indicates a specific substitution mutation. For example, T1A indicates a change from T to A transversion at the first position in the -35 motif. The mutations in the first three nucleotides (TTG) had a significant impact in reducing the promoter activities of both the genes. The impact of mutations was also gene-specific. For p28-Omp14 gene promoter, substitution at the first position T to any other nucleotide resulted in ~40% decline in the promoter activity. Mutations in p28-Omp19 gene at this position also caused a decline in the promoter activity, however, the nucleotide changes caused a greater decline which ranged from 55% to 86%. The promoter activity for this gene is also different for different substitutions; T1C had the greatest impact. Mutations in the second T for both genes had lesser impact compared with the first position mutations. T2A mutation in both genes had an approximately equal amount of decline in the promoter activities (22–25% decline), whereas the T2C mutation caused slightly variable declines in the promoter activities (31% for p28-Omp14 and 46% for p28-Omp19) and T2G had an opposite effect trend for the two gene promoters; this mutation resulted in decline in promoter activity for gene 14 and enhancement for gene 19 promoter. The G3 position resulted in the strongest reduction of promoter activity of both the genes; 39–57% for p28-Omp14 and 46–66% for p28-Omp19. Substitutions in the fourth position also caused significant variations in the promoter activities; C4A mutation in p28-Omp14 and C4T in p28-Omp19 caused increases in the respective promoter activites by ~35%, whereas no significant change was observed for the C4A mutation for p28-Omp19 and for the C4T mutation for p28-Omp14. C4G transversions for both genes resulted in the promoter activities decline to 52% and 36%, respectively. Substitutions in the fifth position T to A caused a substantial enhancement of the promoter activities for both the genes (26% and 75%, respectively). T5C mutation had no significant effect for both the gene promoters, whereas T5G caused about a 63% increase for p28-Omp19 promoter and had no significant for p28-Omp14 promoter. Mutations in the sixth position had no significant impact for p28-Omp19 promoter, but notable declines in the promoter activities were observed for the T6C and T6G mutations for the p28-Omp14 promoter (21% and 35% declines, respectively). The extensive mutational analysis spanning all six positions of the -35 were also assessed for both the gene promoters in an E. coli strain (TOP10) with its native s70 (Fig. 2C and D). The data revealed that the E. chaffeensis s70 differed considerably compared with the E. coli s70 in responding to various point mutations assessed. In particular, only four substititions in p28-Omp14 gene promoter and five substitions in p28-Omp19 gene promoter correlated well in altering the promoter activities when using s70 of E. chaffeensis and E. coli (within ~10% variations). Mutations that correlated well in altering the promoter activity with s70 of E. coli and E. chaffeensis were identified with bold text in Fig. 2C and D. These data suggest that, while the E. coli s70 may complement the function of E. chaffeensis s70, the promoter specificities the two sigma factors are distinct in recognizing the Ehrlichia promoters.

The ß-galactosidase expression driven by E. chaffeensis promoters constructs containing point mutations at each of the six nucleotide positions of the -35 motifs of genes encoding p28-Omp14 (A) and p28-Omp19 (B) were measured in the CAG20177 strain of E. coli expressing E. chaffeensis s70.

In vitro transcription for the sequence determinants of -35 motif by recombinant E. chaffeensis s70To validate the results of -35 motif mutational analyses in CAG20177, we tested several promoter mutations by performing in vitro transcription assays with the holoenzyme reconstituted with recombinant E. chaffeensis s70.32 We randomly selected five mutants of genes encoding p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 and the mutant promoters were re-cloned into the G-less cassette and used as the transcription templates of in vitro transcription assays (Fig. 3). The mutants causing decline in the transcriptional activity in E. coli surrogate system also yielded reduced levels of in vitro transcripts and likewise the mutants which caused an enhancement of transcription also resulted in the increased synthesis of in vitro transcripts. We also noted minor bands migrating slightly larger than the predicted transcripts in two mutnats (T2A and G3A); it is possible that these products may have generated by the RNAP binding to other sites near the promoter in the absence of specific binding. As we previously described,32 the recombination s70 alone or E. coli core enzyme without the sigma factor did not generate in vitro transcripts (data not shown). In vitro transcription analysis validating the Ehrlichia chaffeensis gene promoter mutants spanning the -35 motifs. Six each of the randomly selected mutations at -35 motifs of p28-Omp14 (A and B) and p28-Omp19 (C and D) were exmined by in vitro transcription assays using RNAP holoenzyme containing E. chaffeensis recombinant s70. The abundance of transcripts for each gene was captured from the 32P incorporation. The intensity of a band signals in a gel for in vitro transcriptions made for the wild-type and mutant promoters was determined using the software ImageJ.

Substitutions in region 4.2 of E. chaffeensis s70A conserved region near the C-terminus of the E. coli sigma factor is identified as essential for DNA binding and promoter activity, specifically to the -35 motif,22,28,34 which includes four amino acids in the 4.2 regions of E. coli s70 and are also conserved in E. chaffeensis s70.27 In E. chaffeensis s70, the conserved amino acids are; glutamic acid at 597, two arginines at 598 and 600, and glutamine at 601. To evaluate if mutations in these four amino acids in E. chaffeensis s70 would affect the promoter activity, individual substitution mutation were created to modify these four amino acids in the E. chaffeensis s70 gene coding sequence in the expression plasmid to alanine. Transcriptional activities of the modified sigma factors were assessed with the WT promoters of p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 in the E. coli surrogate system (CAG20177). Mutations at all four locations for both the gene promoters resulted in significant reduction of the promoter activity (~48–57% decline) (Fig. 4A and B). To verify these data, we also performed in vitro transcription assays with the E. chaffeensis s70 mutants where arginine at position 598 and 600 was modified to alanine using the WT promoters of both p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 genes (Fig. 4C and D). The in vitro transcription also was reduced for the mutants. We also tested the ability of one of the mutant forms (E579A mutation) of E. chaffeensis s70 in driving transcription from three mutant promoters of p28-Omp19 with substitutions T1A, T2A and C4T in E. coli surrogate system (Fig. 5). The promoter activities for all three mutations in the of p28-Omp19 promoter caused a further decline of 90%, 60% and 66% relative to the WT promoter, respectively. Substitutions in region 4.2 of Ehrlichia chaffeensis s70 influence the promoter activity of the wild-type E. chaffeensis promoters (A, p28-Omp14 and B, p28-Omp19). Mutations to change amino acids to alanine at four conserved residues (E597, R598, R600 and Q601) of E. chaffeensis s70 were assessed with the wild-type promoters; p28-Omp14 (A) and p28-Omp19 (B). ß-galactosidase expression was measured for the mutant proteins relative to the wild-type (WT) E. chaffeensis s70. Mutations in the conserved amino acids of E. chaffeensis s70 4.2 region also cause reduction in the in vitro transcript synthesis from the wild-type promoters (C and D). In vitro transcription analysis was performed using RNAP holoenzyme containing E. chaffeensis recombinant wild-type s70, or with its mutants R598A or R600A and with wild-type p28-Omp14 (C) and p28-Omp19 (D) promoters.Substitutions in region 4.2 of Ehrlichia chaffeensis s70 influence the promoter activity of the wild-type E. chaffeensis promoters (A, p28-Omp14 and B, p28-Omp19).

The activities for the -35 motif mutants T1A, T2A and C4T of p28-Omp19 promoter were assessed with E. chaffeensis s70 mutant (E597A) by measuring changes in the ß-galactosidase expression in the E. coli strain CAG20177. The reduction of the enzyme activity was expressed relative to the wild-type promoter.A change in a conserved amino acid of Ehrlichia chaffeensis s70 4.2 region further reduced the promoter activity in -35 motif mutants.

The reduction of the enzyme activity was expressed relative to the wild-type promoter.3.5. The spacer sequences affect promoter activityThe extensive experimental analysis described above revealed that the -35 motif, but not -10, impacted the E. chaffeensis transcription driven by its s70 for the two genes assessed. The deletion of -35 motifs caused significant decline of the promoter activities, but did not completely abolish the transcription, suggesting that the promoter function requires the contributions of additional sequences. In particular, we hypothesized that the sequences other than the -35 motifs also contribute to the differences in the promoter activities of the two genes. In E. coli, the length of a spacer sequence between the -10 and -35 motifs influences promoter activity.33,35 Previous studies in E. coli also demonstrated that the nucleotide differences within the spacer sequences also influence the promoter activity.23–25 We investigated if spacer sequences also similarly influence the promoter activity of E. chaffeensis genes by modifying the spacer sequences. We constructed three mutants to modify the spacer region of the p28-Omp14 gene promoter: (i) the AT-rich spacer sequence of the gene is replaced with complementary nucleotides at each position of the spacer (SP1) to keep the AT and GC content constant, (ii) the sequence is replaced with a sequence having GC-rich spacer sequence (SP2), or (iii) the spacer sequence of p28-Omp14 gene promoter is replaced with the p28-Omp19 gene promoter spacer sequence (SP3) (Fig. 6A). The SP3 construct is included to test if replacing the spacer sequence of p28-Omp14 gene with p28-Omp19 gene is sufficient in enhancing the promoter activity to that observed for the p28-Omp19 gene promoter, as both the promoters have identical -35 motifs. The WT and the modified constructs were tested in the E. coli system by measuring the ß-galactosidase activity; the SP1 and SP2 caused the reduction of the enzyme activity by 56% and 59%, respectively (Fig. 6B). The substitution with the p28-Omp19 gene spacer (SP3) caused enhancement of the promoter activity by ~1.6-fold (Fig. 6B). These results suggested that the spacer sequences of the E. chaffeensis gene promoters play an important role in transcriptional variations and may also account for some of the differences in the activities of p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 gene WT promoters. AT-rich spacer sequence located between -10 and -35 motif contributes to altering the promoter activity of Ehrlichia chaffeensis genes. Promoter fragments used in the assays are as in Supplementary Fig. S2 for wild-type p28-Omp14 gene. (A) sequence spanning from +1 to -35 motif and the AT-rich spacer sequence is presented for the wild-type construct (WT) and for the constructs with modified spacer sequences which included replacing the AT-rich spacer with complementary sequence (SP1), with GC-rich spacer sequence (SP2) or with the p28-Omp19 gene spacer sequence (SP3). (B) The ß-galactosidase expression driven by promoters of WT, SP1, SP2 and SP3 in E. coli (CAG20177) expressing E. chaffeensis s70 was measured and the data were presented.

The assay also included the data generated from the promoterless construct control (NP).Previous studies in E. coli revealed that the 1.1 region of its s70 contributes to the promoter activity by modulating the formation of stable polymerase and promoter complexes.24,36,37 Deletion of this region causes enhanced or decreased promoter activity depending on a promoter.24,36 The impact of 1.1 deletion is also variable for different spacer sequences for the promoters containing the same -35 and -10 motifs, as evidenced for Ptac and PuvsX/sigma.36 As E. chaffeensi p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19 promoters have the identical -35, and that -10 was found to be less important for the transcription from these two gene promoters, we investigated if the 1.1 deletion E. chaffeensis s70 also cause variations in the promoter activities if we modify the spacer sequences. The deletion of 1.1 region in E. chaffeensis s70 led to significant enhancement of the promoter activity when assessed for the WT p28-Omp14 promoter segment. Modified spacer sequences containing the complementary sequence (SP1) or GC sequence (SP2) or the replacement of the spacer sequence with WT p28-Omp19 promoter spacer sequence (SP3) also resulted in the enhancement of promoter activities (Fig. 7).  WT and SP1, SP2 and SP3 constructs were assessed for their promoter activities in E. coli expressing wild-type Ehrlichia chaffeensis s70 from rpoD gene or from its mutant having deletion at 1.1 region (rpoD 1.1). The ß-galactosidase expression was significantly higher for all four promoters when assessed with rpoD 1.1 compared with the wild-type rpoD. WT and SP1, SP2 and SP3 constructs were assessed for their promoter activities in E. coli expressing wild-type Ehrlichia chaffeensis s70 from rpoD gene or from its mutant having deletion at 1.1 region (rpoD 1.1). The ß-galactosidase expression was significantly higher for all four promoters when assessed with rpoD 1.1 compared with the wild-type rpoD.The changes of base sequence for the spacer DNA fragments with identical length possibly render different conformations or curvatures to a DNA molecule24,25 and may aid in altering the affinities of RNAP binding and transcription. DNA conformational changes can also impact migration patterns in a polyacrylamide gel (PAG).24,25 To test this, we compared the mobility of DNA fragments of p28-Omp14 promoter segments, WT, SP1, SP2 and SP3, by subjecting to electrophoresis in a non-denaturing PAG (Fig. 8A). The gel migration patterns are different for all four DNAs. Consistent with these results, the predicted DNA structures have different topologies as judged by the ‘model it’ program (Fig. 8B).38Changes in the AT-rich spacer sequence impact DNA gel migration and conformation.

DiscussionIt is unclear how E. chaffeensis and the related Anaplasmataceae family pathogens transmitted from ticks regulate their gene expression in vertebrate and tick hosts. Ehrlichia chaffeensis genome contains genes only for two sigma factors (s32 and s70) and for very few predicted transcriptional regulators (GenBank # NC_007799.1).1 To understand how the Anaplasmataceae family pathogens adapt to their vertebrate and tick hosts and sense nutrient and starving environments within an infected host cell requires a detailed knowledge about the pathogens’ gene regulation. Studying the regulation of gene expression is also important in defining the molecular basis for the conversions to the pathogens’ infectious form (dense core cells) and replicating form (reticulate cells) within a phagosome of an infected host cell. Our recent data support the hypothesis that the E. chaffeensis sigma factors, s32 and s70, function cooperatively in transcribing pathogen genes.27 The current study is the first to undertake a detailed investigation at the gene level to map differences in gene expression accomplished by two distinct and closely related genes; Ech_1136 and Ech_1143, of the pathogen encoding for the proteins; p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19, respectively.In the absence of a genetic transformation system, researchers investigating the gene expression of intracellular Chlamydia species pathogens relied on the use of in vitro transcription method to study the bacterial gene regulation and to define the transcriptional mechanisms.31,39–41,In vitro transcription assays are proven the most valuable in defining the transcriptional machinery of several Chlamydia genes.40–46Ehrlichia species research is also challenging due to lack of a well-established genetic transformation system and the lack of natural plasmids in them further complicates the research focused on studying gene regulation. In the current study, we developed and utilized the E. coli surrogate system to map the DNA binding domains involved in regulating the gene expression in E. chaffeensis. Further, we used the in vitro transcription system to validate the data. The approaches also aided in determining the molecular basis for differences in gene expression from two closely related genes.Escherichia coli transcriptions for housekeeping genes are driven by RNAP holoenzyme containing s70 which recognizes two highly conserved motifs; referred as -10 and -35 motifs.13 The consensus motif sequences are TATAAT and TTGACA, respectively. The s70 homologs are also extensively conserved in several other Gram-negative bacteria.12 We recently reported that the consensus -10 and -35 motifs for E. chaffeensis s70 are TATTNT and TTGNTT, respectively.27 We also reported that the -10 and -35 motifs for the alternative sigma factor, s32, in E. chaffeensis (TATATN and TTGAAA, respectively) are very similar to s70 consensus sequences for the genes we assessed.27 The -10 motif of E. chaffeensis, however, differs considerably from the E. coli s32 consensus -10 motif (CCCCATNT), while the consensus -35 motif is identical (TTGAAA).47,48 Consistent with the extensive homology of s32 and s70 consensus -10 and -35 motifs, E. chaffeensis genes can also be transcribed by both the sigma factors, but with varying affinities.27,Ehrlichia chaffeensis has two morphological forms; dense core and reticulate cells49,50 and it is entirely unknown how the organism and the related rickettsial organisms having two distinct morphological forms and also having the ability to adapt to dual hosts regulate their gene expression. Considering the lack of genetic tools and transformation system, the methods described in the current study will be valuable in defining the gene regulation in this organism, the related Anaplasmataceae family organisms, and in extending studies to other intracellular Gram-negative pathogens having two distinct morphological forms, such as Chlamydia species and Coxiella burnetii.51,52The consensus -35 motifs in all mapped E. chaffeensis genes, independent of a gene primarily transcribed by s32 or s70, contain the extensively conserved first three nucleotides at the 5' end.27 In this study, we presented data demonstrating that the -10 motifs are not critical for the gene activities of two closely related outer membrane protein genes (p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19) driven by its primary sigma factor, s70. At this time, it is not clear if -10 motif is similarly less important for other pathogen genes. This hypothesis needs further investigation. We also presented evidence that the -35 motifs are critical for the s70 function for the two genes assessed. Further, we reported that any changes to the first three nucleotides of the -35 motif, TTG, result in significant decline in the promoter activities, despite different degrees of variations observed for the two gene promoters. The TTG in -35 motifs is conserved in most of the E. chaffeensis genes suggesting that its interactions with s70 may be vital for its function, although the remaining three nucleotides on the -35 motif may also play a critical role for the gene-specific transcription. The TTG is also found to be important for s70 gene promoters of E. coli.53 It is well known that sigma factors possess variable numbers of DNA binding regions.12,54 Each region holds a specific role in promoter recognition. For example, the region 4 located in the C-terminus contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif of known DNA-binding protein.55 Previous studies revealed that the 4.2 region in E. coli s70 is involved in the base-specific recognition with the -35 motif.15,20 Moreover, the substitutions in four conserved charged amino acids at E265, R266, R268 and Q269 in E. coli s32 to a non-polar amino acid, alanine, cause reduction of the promoter activity.22 Sequence allignment revealed that the E. chaffeensis s32 has the same four amino acids as conserved and mutating these amino acids to alanine also resulted in the reduction of its function in driving the promoter activities of the genes recognized by it.27 These four amino acids are also conserved in E. chaffeensis s70 and that the mutations in these amino acids to alanine also negatively impacted the promoter activity. In Fig. 5, when combined E579A substitution in s70 and T1A, T2A and C4T substitution in the p28-Omp19 promoter, respectively, the lower activity of promoter was observed compared with WT promoter. The results suggest that the E579 may not interact with these bases of the -35 motif for the p28-Omp19 promoter, as reported previously for E. coli.22 Additional experimental analysis is necessary to test this hypothesis and to evaluate if this domain in E. chaffeensis is also involved in base-specific recognition.It is well demonstrated in E. coli that the length of a spacer sequence between the -10 and -35 motifs influences promoter activity.33,35 Recent studies also suggest that the kind of specific nucleotides present within a spacer region also influence the promoter activity.23–25 In the current study, we investigated the role of spacer sequences for E. chaffeensis RNAP function and their contributions to differences in transcription levels of two closely related genes, as both the genes have different nucleotide sequences in the spacers while the lengths remain the same. Indeed, our data demonstrated that modifying the spacer sequence with complementary sequence in the p28-Omp14 gene promoter or by replacing with a randomly selected GC-rich spacer sequence caused significant reduction in the promoter activity. Interestingly, replacing the WT p28-Omp14 spacer with the spacer from the p28-Omp19 gene promoter enhanced the promoter activity by ~1.6-fold. The p28-Omp19 gene promoter is ~3-fold stronger than the p28-Omp14 gene promoter, as evidenced by the 3-fold higher ß-galactosidase expression observed in the E. coli surrogate system. The 1.6-fold enhancement of the p28-Omp14 gene promoter activity when replaced with the p28-Omp19 spacer suggests that the spacer sequence is a major contributer for the differences in the promoter activities of the two colesely related outer membrane protein genes. As reported earlier for an E. coli gene,24 the data for E. chaffeensis genes also demonstrate that the variations in spacer sequences influence in altering the promoter activity of a gene, possibly due to differing conformations or curvatures. In particular, we present the evidence that the nucleotide differences within a spacer sequence are important contributors in influencing the promoter strengths, possibly due to altering the curvature of a promoter leading to altered interactions with RNAP. Previous studies in E. coli demonstrated that the spacer sequences affect the RNA polymerase binding affinity.56 This hypothesis remains to be tested for E. chaffeensis.Depending on the promoter assessed, the loss of region 1.1 within the E. coli s70 protein can influence the promoter activity of a gene positively or negatively or can cause no impact.36 For example, Hook-Barnard24 reported that the deletion of region 1.1 domain within the E. coli s70 protein increases the transcription by ~2-fold from Pmin7 gene promoter. On the contrary, its deletion has no significant effect on the amount of mRNA made from the Pmin7/GC or Pmin/comp promoters when assessed with modified spacer sequences (GC-rich spacer or complementary spacer).24 It is reported that region 1.1 at the N-terminal of s70 of E. coli affect spacer-mediated changes in transcriptional initiation via converting the trajectory of the spacer of promoter.24 In the current study, we presented evidence that E. chaffeensis s70 with a mutation of region 1.1 significantly enhances the activity of WT p28-Omp14 gene promoter and the promoter with mutant spacer sequences (SP1, SP2 and SP3).This work is the first to utilize various molecular approaches in defining the -10 and -35 motifs and the AT-rich spacer sequences located between the two motifs of two closely related E. chaffeensis genes encoding for differentially expressed proteins; p28-Omp14 and p28-Omp19. The differences in the spacer sequences alone are sufficient in altering the gene transcription by 1.6-fold. In particular, we presented the first evidence demonstrating that the difference in transcription by ~50% from two closely related genes can be accounted due to differences in their AT-rich spacer sequences. DNA binding proteins may be additional contributors in influencing the gene expression. Previous studies by Cheng et al.57 using the E. coli RNAP holoenzyme demonstrated that an E. chaffeensis DNA regulator, EcxR, serves as an activator in promoting the gene expression of several type IV secretion system genes of the pathogen. The role of DNA transcription regulators remain to be investigated for their contributions to differential expression from p28-Omp genes. The E. coli surrogate system described in the current study can facilitate greatly in evaluating the DNA transcription regulators of E. chaffeensis. We believe that the current study will also be valuable for furthering our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in E. chaffeensis and in defining the detailed molecular basis of differential gene expression and its contributions to the pathogen adaptations to dual hosts and in sensing the distinct host cell environments. The molecular methods described here are also valuable for studies focused on understanding the gene regulation in other related rickettsial pathogens.In summary, we developed an E. coli surrogate system and used it to extensively map E. chaffeensis two s70 gene promoters. The E. coli system was also used to present evidence that the loss of -10 motifs has no role for the gene expression for the two genes assessed in the current study. We also mapped the critical determinants of the -35 motif by performing mutational analysis. Further, we demonstrated that the AT-rich sequences are involved in contributing to promoter-specific variations in the gene transcriptions.

IntroductionAspergillus luchuensis is a kuro (black) koji mold that is used widely for brewing Japanese traditional spirits, awamori, in the Okinawa islands, which are located in the most southern part of Japan.1–3 Recently, A. luchuensis has also been employed to produce shochu, a distilled beverage manufactured in the Kyushu islands. A. luchuensis produces vast amounts of enzymes, which facilitate the maceration and saccharification of raw materials, such as rice, wheat, and sweet potato. Similar to A. niger, A. luchuensis produces an abundance of citric acid, which maintains the fermentation mash at a low pH to prevent contamination by wild microorganisms. Interestingly, the glycosidases produced by A. luchuensis have higher catalytic activity in a more acidic pH range than those secreted by A. oryzae, which is used for brewing Japanese sake, rice wine.4,5 These characteristics enable highly effective and reliable fermentation in warm latitudes, such as Okinawa and the Kyushu islands. There are approximately 50 awamori brewers in Okinawa who originally used their own strains, but recently, they have employed koji-seed (conidiospores) supplied by companies. The market size of awamori is 13,000 Myen (130 Mdollar), and the total market size of Japanese traditional spirits, including Shochu, is 470,000 Myen (4,700 Mdollar). Furthermore, the high potential of its secretory enzymes and the safety of A. luchuensis make this microorganism extremely important for modern biotechnology.Historically, A. luchuensis was isolated primarily from awamori koji in the Okinawa islands by Inui in 1901,6 who stated that A. luchuensis is the major fermentation agent in awamori production and that it possesses uniseriate conidial heads. In the same year, Usami also isolated two major kuro koji molds from awamori koji and reported that black Aspergillus No. 1 must be A. luchuensis Inui.7 In 1913, Nakazawa obtained a and ß strains from awamori koji, and the a strain is an important mold for awamori fermentation.8 He designated the a strain as A. awamori and rejected A. luchuensis as a kuro koji mold because the a strain possessed biseriate conidial heads, although its morphological characteristics were similar to those of A. luchuensis. These kuro koji molds exhibit clear differences from standard A. niger strains, where the conidial surface is smooth and unable to assimilate nitrate in its early culture stage.9,10 In 1980, Al-Musallam revised the taxonomy of black Aspergillus, and A. awamori was synonymized as A. niger var. awamori based on NRRL4948 from the Instituto Ozwaldo Cruz, Brazil, rather than Nakazawa’s a strain.11 A recent phylogenetic analysis of several known genes, including the RTS of ribosomal DNA, demonstrated that the A. awamori strains in NRIB and NITE (NBRC) formed two major clusters, one of which co-clustered with A. niger, whereas the other clade co-clustered with A. kawachii and industrial kuro koji molds.1 Thus, the classification of kuro koji molds is in dispute. In 2012, Hong et al. re-described A. luchuensis as an industrially important black Aspergillus in East Asia with biseriate conidial heads, and A. kawachii was synonymized as A. luchuensis.12,13 Extrolite analysis of A. luchuensis strains showed that they do not produce mycotoxins, and thus, they can be considered safe for use in food and beverage fermentation. Hong et al. also proposed that A. awamori is a cryptic phylogenetic species in the section Nigri, and they rejected the species name, A. awamori.In this study, we sequenced A. luchuensis NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604), which was received from Usami as A. awamori No. 1, and it was stored at the IFO (NBRC).14 The genome size was approximately 34.7 Mb, which is almost the same as that of A. niger CBS 513.88, and the average shared identity at the nucleic acid level was 88.9%. We identified some genes that are important for awamori fermentation, and we analyzed the protein N-and O-glycosylation systems in detail. We also determined the mating locus and confirmed the nonproduction of mycotoxins.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and DNA preparationA. luchuensis NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604) was used as the DNA donor. Genomic DNA preparation and removal of mitochondrial DNA were performed as described previously.15,162.2. Genome sequencingThe genome of A. luchuensis was sequenced using the whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approach by accumulating raw sequence reads with a depth of coverage of approximately 5.7×. The linkage between contigs was analyzed by fingerprinting and PCR, as well as by optical mapping (OpGen).2.3 Gene prediction and annotationGeneDecoder17 and GlimmerHMM18 were used for gene prediction. Automated annotation was performed using NCBI BLASTP with the A. niger CBS 513.88 genomic database.19 Interproscan20 was used for functional analysis of the predicted proteins. The number of genes in each cluster of orthologous group (COG)21 category was analyzed by BLASTP using the amino acid sequences in the COG set with bit scores =60. Comparative analysis of A. luchuensis and A. niger was conducted with MUMmer tools.22 AntiSmash23 was used to search for secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters.Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequence and gene predictionThe A. luchuensis genome was sequenced using the WGS approach. The 34.7 Mb genome was predicted to contain 11,691 genes that encoded proteins with a length greater than 100 amino acid residues (Table 1). The genome was confirmed as comprising eight chromosomes (chromosomes 1–8 in decreasing order of size). Properties of the genomes of Aspergillus luchuensis NBRC 4314, A. niger CBS 513.88, and A. kawachii NBRC 4308Genes that encoded polypeptides longer than 100 amino acids were used in the analysis.Properties of the genomes of Aspergillus luchuensis NBRC 4314, A. niger CBS 513.88, and A. kawachii NBRC 4308Genes that encoded polypeptides longer than 100 amino acids were used in the analysis.The average shared identity at the nucleic acid level between A. luchuensis NBRC 4314 and A. niger CBS 513.88 was estimated as 88.9% using the dnadiff wrapper script in the MUMmer 3.0 package. MUMmer also showed that the correspondence between the chromosomes of A. luchuensis and A niger was extremely low compared with that between those of A. niger CBS 513.88 and A. niger ATCC 1015,24 which were almost the same (Fig. 1). For example, chromosome 1 of A. luchuensis appeared to be composed of portions of chromosome 6, 2 and 4 of A. niger. These results are consistent with the suggestion that A. luchuensis is a different species from A. niger.

The colored areas refer to the chromosomes assigned to A. niger CBS 513.88.The COG classification detected no major differences between A. niger and A. oryzae (Table 2). For instance, most of the transcription factors were found in the genomes of A. luchuensis, as well as A. niger, and A. oryzae (Supplementary Table S1).25,26Gene numbers for each COG in Aspergillus luchuensis NBRC 4314, A. niger CBS 513.88, and A. kawachii NBRC 4308Genes that encoded polypeptides longer than 100 amino acids were used in the analysis.

Glycosidases and citric acid productionDuring the fermentation of awamori and shochu, the most important role of the kuro koji mold A. luchuensis is to produce sufficient glycolytic enzymes to convert starch in materials, such as glucose, as well as generating citric acid, which maintains the fermentation mash at a low pH. Previously, it was reported that A. luchuensis secretes a characteristic acid-stable a-amylase (AA1_SCon_015_0343), which can function at an acidic pH due to citric acid production. This acid-stable a-amylase has a starch-binding domain in the C-terminus. By contrast, A. oryzae possesses three copies of the taka-amylase gene, where the amyA gene comprises an amy gene cluster with the amyR (transcription factor of amylase genes) and agdA (a-glucosidase) genes. A. luchuensis was also predicted to possess an amy gene cluster comprising AA1_SCon_020_0630 (amyR), AA1_SCon_020_0632 (a-glucosidase), and AA1_SCon_020_0632.5 (a-amylase). Interestingly, the homology between AA1_SCon_020_0632.5 and the amyA gene product (taka-amylase) was relatively low at 73.5%, but a gene almost identical to taka-amylase was found on contig AA1_SCon_049.Con002, which was not assigned to the chromosome. Similarly, A. kawachii has a taka-amylase orthologue, AKAW_11452, in addition to an amy gene cluster and acid-stable a-amylase. Three other putative a-amylase genes (AA1_SCon_008_0403, AA1_SCon_018_0661, and AA1_SCon_011_0021) were also found, which shared 39%–46% identity with taka-amylase according to a BLASTP search. They possessed three conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic active site of a-amylase. A. oryzae possesses two glucoamylase genes, where glaA is expressed in submerged culture and glaB is expressed in solid-state culture.27 We found that A. luchuensis contained only one glucoamylase gene (AA1_SCon_031_0271), which had a starch-binding domain in the C-terminus, whereas A. oryzae lacks this domain. More detailed studies are required to clarify the functions of these glycolytic enzymes in awamori and shochu fermentation.During the production of awamori and shochu koji (solid-state culture of Aspergillus mold on grain), the temperature is typically increased to 40 °C in the early cultivation stages to increase the activity of amylase and then lowered to 30 °C in the later stages to promote the production of citric acid. However, the method employed for citric acid production is poorly understood in A. luchuensis, and the detailed mechanism is also unclear in A. niger. Kirimura reported that a cyanide- and antimycin A-insensitive and salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiratory pathway catalyzed by an alternative oxidase (AOX1) functions in mitochondria, where the cytochrome pathway and inhibition of AOX1 dramatically decreased citric acid production in A. niger, although mycelial growth was not affected.28 The orthologue of AOX1, AA1_SCon_015_0483, may also play an important role in citric acid production by A. luchuensis. The members of the glycolytic system and tricarboxylic acid cycle in A. luchuensis are listed in Supplementary Table S2. More detailed functional studies of these enzymes are required.3.3 Protease genesGenome sequencing of A. luchuensis NBRC 4314 showed that this strain contained almost the same protease genes as A. niger CBS 513.88. We estimated the putative amino acid sequences from the A. luchuensis genome sequence based on the fact that the amino acid sequences around the catalytic residues in the active sites of proteases are conserved.29 Black Aspergillus, A. luchuensis, and A. niger possess many acidic proteases. The typical acidic proteases, aspartic endopeptidases,30,31 and serine-type carboxypeptidases32,33 have an optimum pH of below pH 4.0, and we found 10 and 13 of each, respectively, in the A. luchuensis genome. In addition, A. niger and A. oryzae possess 10 and 11 aspartic protease genes, respectively, and 12 serine carboxypeptidase genes. Each of the 12 serine-type carboxypeptidase genes in A. luchuensis had orthologs in the other two Aspergillus strains, and one additional gene in A. luchuensis was a homologue of gene corresponding to ocpB.34 These two genes might have been generated by gene duplication. The sedolysin family enzymes are also acidic proteolytic enzymes, and the optimum pH range for these enzymes in A. fumigatus was reported as pH 5.5–6.0.35,A. luchuensis and A. niger have seven sedolysin family enzyme genes, whereas A. fumigatus Af 239 and A. oryzae RIB 40 have only four and five genes, respectively. The neutral and alkaline protease genes were not as abundant as the acidic proteases. Three serine endopeptidase (kexin,36 an oryzin37 ortholog, and a putative vacuole enzyme38) genes were found in the A. luchuensis genome, similar to other Aspergillus strains. Among the metalloendopeptidases, there was one thermolysin-type enzyme gene,39 but deuterolysins40 were not found, similar to the A. niger genome. The genes of theses enzyme have been found in A. sojae, A. oryzae,41 and A. fumigatus,42 and even Penicillium.43 As described above, A. luchuensis and A. niger share similar protease genes and black Aspergillus strains might differ genetically from other Aspergillus strains. However, in terms of glutamic peptidase genes,44A. luchuensis appeared to possess both A. niger-type and A. oryzae-type genes. A. niger and A. oryzae possess three glutamic peptidase genes, and A. luchuensis has five genes. The phylogenetic tree of the genes for these enzymes in the three Aspergillus strains is shown in Figure 2. AA1_SCon_006_0020- and AA1_SCon_019_0031-type genes are found in all three Aspergillus strains. A. niger lacks a counterpart of AA1_SCon_039_0035, whereas it is present in A. oryzae. By contrast, genes corresponding to AA1_SCon_011_0044 are found in A. niger but not in A. oryzae. AA1_SCon_006_0811 is an orthologue of AA1_Scon_019_0031. These results might indicate that glutamic peptidase genes have been amplified by gene duplication in Aspergillus strains, but A. niger and A. oryzae possess a reduced number of unnecessary genes, whereas they have been conserved in A. luchuensis. Thus, Aspergillus strains might be divided into A. oryzae and black Aspergillus groups and black Aspergillus might have lost the deuterolysin genes. A. luchuensis might have maintained glutamic peptidase genes that resemble the genes in A. oryzae. Glutamic peptidases are also acidic proteases, so maintaining genes for both types of enzyme might have improved the ability in acidic condition.

Protein N-and O-glycosylationA. luchuensis and other Aspergillus species produce large amounts of extracellular proteins, such as glucoamylase and a-amylase. During the secretion process, the proteins are glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Protein glycosylation is believed to play critical roles in various cell activities, such as quality control in secretory proteins, cell wall integrity, environmental adaptation, and pathogenicity in some pathogenic fungi. These roles are related to the function, protein stability, and appropriate localization of secretory proteins, and antigenicity is modulated by protein glycosylation. Analysis of the A. luchuensis genome found that the genes involved in the protein N- and O-glycosylation are conserved relative to those in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although the N- and O-glycan structures attached to the proteins differ between these two members of Ascomycota.45,46The N-glycan structure in S. cerevisiae is characterized as a high mannose type. Protein N-glycosylation is initiated in the ER by an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex using Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dolichol as a sugar donor. The OST complex comprises at least eight subunits in yeast. The orthologue of the catalytic subunit, Stt2, in the OST complex has been characterized in A. fumigatus.47 All of the genes that encode the seven subunits other than yeast-specific OST5 are conserved in A. luchuensis (Fig. 3). After the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to Asn residues in a polypeptide, three glucose residues and one mannose residue are removed by the actions of the Gls2–Gtb1 complex and Mns1, respectively. This process is crucial for the quality control of secretory proteins in the ER and for the ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins via recognition by lectins. The orthologues of yeast GlS2, GTB1, and MNS1 have been functionally characterized in A. oryzae.48,49 Thus, the genes (AA1_SCon_023_0105, AA1_SCon_007_0165, and AA1_SCon_010_0597) responsible for the trimming of N-glycans in the ER are well conserved in A. luchuensis. Glycoproteins that enter the Golgi apparatus are subjected to further elongation with N-glycans. Yeast glycoproteins localized in the cell wall and the periplasmic space contain a long branched polymer with approximately 200 mannoses and phosphate in the N-glycans. However, the N-glycans in Aspergillus species are Man5-24GlcNac2-N, which are shorter in size than those found in yeast.50,51 The differences in the structure of N-glycans between these fungi are due to the presence of the long a-1,6-mannan and a unique phosphorylation pattern in yeast. The long a-1,6-mannan and phosphate residues in N-glycans are synthesized via the actions of Och1 and Mnn6, respectively (Fig. 3). The A. fumigatus OCH1 orthologue compensates for the defective OCH1 in yeast.52,A. luchuensis also possesses an OCH1 orthologue (AA1_SCon_006_0409), so this fungus may have the ability to elongate N-glycans in the same manner as yeast. Given that A. luchuensis possesses all of the genes involved in the elongation of N-glycans in the same manner as yeast and that the genes are expressed according to microarray analysis (Supplementary Table S3), then it is likely that the degradation of N-glycans by a-mannosidases will yield short N-glycans in Aspergillus species. S. cerevisiae possesses at least two genes, DCW1 and DFG5, encoding putative GPI-anchored a-1,6-mannosidases.53 We found that the A. luchuensis genome contained 11 ORFs with good hits against Dcw1 according to BLASTP searches using S. cerevisiae sequence datasets (Supplementary Table S4). Microarray data showed that all of these genes were expressed in the solid-state culture, koji. Among the 11 putative a-mannosidases, 10 a-mannosidases possessed the predicted signal sequence, thereby implying that these are secretory proteins. Four a-mannosidases, that is, AA1_SCon_019_0007, AA1_SCon_027_0100, AA1_SCon_016_0076, and AA1_SCon_020_0838, possessed a potential GPI-modification site as found in yeast, similar to Dcw1 and Dfg5, whereas no GPI-modification site was predicted in the other seven a-mannosidases. Thus, the localizations and functions of these a-mannosidases may differ from those in yeast, Dcw1 and Dfg5. Experimentally based functional characterizations of these mannosidases will allow us to understand the reason why Aspergillus species contain short N-glycans compared with those in yeast.

The O-glycans comprise Man1-O, Mana1-2Man1-O, Mana1-6Man1-O, Man1-6(Glc1-3)Man1-O, Man1-6(Galp1-3)Man1-O, Man1-6Man1-6Glc1-3Man1-O, and Mana1-2(Mana1-6)Man1-O.54 The O-glycan found in the glycoproteins of S. cerevisiae possesses a linear chain with up to five mannose residues, the structure of which is Mana1-3Mana1-3Mana1-2Mana1-2Man1-O. Protein O-glycosylation is initiated in the ER by the action of the protein O-mannosyltransferase (Pmt) using dolichol phosphate mannose as a sugar donor.55 Seven pmt genes are present in S. cerevisiae, which are classified into three protein subfamilies, i.e., Pmt1, Pmt2, and Pmt4 subfamilies. Each member of the Pmt4 subfamily forms a dimer complex with proteins from the same subfamily, whereas each member of the Pmt1 subfamily forms a dimer complex with Pmt2 subfamily members. The simultaneous disruption of more than three pmt genes yields a lethal phenotype in yeast. However, filamentous fungi only possess three pmt genes from each of the Pmt subfamilies. The three pmt genes characterized in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus play crucial roles in hyphal development, morphology, and asexual conidiation in these fungi.56–60 Our genome analysis demonstrated that A. luchuensis also possesses three pmt genes, among which pmtA has been characterized (Supplementary Table S5).61 The disruption of pmtA in A. awamori (luchuensis) does not affect the extracellular secretion level of glucoamylase, but it has negative effects on the growth rate, cell morphology, and conidia formation. After initial mannosylation by Pmt in the ER, further glycosylation occurs due to the action of sugar transferases in the Golgi apparatus during the secretory process. Multiple a-1,2- and a-1,3-mannosyltransferases have been characterized in yeast, but a sugar transferase responsible for this elongation process has not been characterized in Aspergillus spp. Our genome analysis of A. luchuensis detected three orthologues of yeast a-1,2 mannosyltransferase62 (Fig. 4).

The Galf residues present in pathogenic A. fumigatus are immunogenic in mammals, and they are assumed to be involved in pathogenicity in humans, so the inhibition and detection of this sugar’s biosynthesis might be exploited in the development of chemotherapy and diagnostics related to Aspergillus infections.64 The gfsA gene that encodes galactofuranosyltransferases involved in the addition of Galf to O-mannose-type glycans has been identified in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus.65 We found that A. luchuensis genome possesses three homologues of the A. nidulans gfs (Supplementary Table S5).3.5. Mating-type lociA. luchuensis is considered to be asexual, and it might be heterothallic in the same manner as A. oryzae. In heterothallic ascomycetes, the mating type is determined by the alternative presence of either of two genes called idiomorphs, which occupy the same locus in the chromosome, but that shares no sequence similarity with each other. The MAT1-1 gene encodes a protein with an alpha box domain, and the MAT1-2 gene encodes a protein with a high mobility group (HMG) domain. We found the MAT1-2 HMG gene (AA1_SCon_025_0346) in the A. luchuensis NBRC 4314 genome. To investigate the possibility of breeding A. luchuensis strains by mating, we searched for the opposite mating type gene in 28 strains classified as A. luchuensis by PCR using the primer set: MAT1-1F-An (5'-GCGGCCACTGAACAGTTTCATTGCT-3') and MAT1-1R-An (5'-TGATGGAGTATGCCTTGGCTACGATG-3'). Interestingly, we found no MAT1-1 strains, and all 28 of the A. luchuensis strains that we analyzed had the MAT1-2 mating type gene. Thus, our previous efforts to mate A. luchuensis were unsuccessful because we tried to cross strains with the same mating type. It was also suggested that if we could isolate strains with MAT1-1, this would allow the improvement of A. luchuensis strains by sexual crossing.3.6. Safety and nonproductivity of mycotoxinsThe secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi, especially mycotoxins, are most important from a safety viewpoint. A. niger has been reported to produce two types of mycotoxin, i.e., ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisin B.66,67 Previously, we reported that the synthesis of OTA by A. niger is mediated partly by polyketide synthase, which is encoded by the An15g07920 gene, and we showed that A. luchuensis lacks this gene based on PCR and Southern analyses.1 Interestingly, in the genome of A. niger CBS 513.88, An15g07920 forms a gene cluster with the cytochrome P450 and nonribosomal peptide synthase genes, whereas A. niger ATCC 1015 lacks this gene cluster. Genome sequencing demonstrated A. luchuensis has also lost a 21-kb region of the OTA cluster in a similar manner to both A. niger ATCC 1015 and A. kawachii IFO 4308.3,24 Thus, these results show clearly that A. luchuensis lacks the ability to produce OTA.The fumonisins are a group of polyketide-derived mycotoxins, which were first isolated in 1988 from Fusarium verticillioides.68 In contrast to the OTA gene cluster, the genomes of both A. niger CBS 513.88 and ATCC 1015 include putative homologues of the F. verticillioides fumonisin gene cluster, and the actual production of fumonisin B2 has been confirmed. The fumonisin gene cluster of A. niger contains at least 14 fum genes. We searched the A. luchuensis genome for orthologues of A. niger fumonisin biosynthesis cluster genes using bidirectional best hit analysis. Only the fum1 and fum15 gene products shared high identity with AA1_SCon_021_0823 (68% identity, polyketide synthase) and AA1_SCon_021_0825 (72% identity, cytochrome P450) . The other FUM proteins shared low identities of 20%–43%, and these orthologues were distributed throughout the A. luchuensis genome. Analyses of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters using antiSMASH only predicted that AA1_SCon_021_0823 and AA1_SCon_021_0825 comprised a gene cluster (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that A. luchuensis lacks most of the fum genes and productivity of fumonisin, even if these two gene products are functional. Interestingly, the orthologues of fum1 and fum15 lie next to each other in opposite directions in the A. luchuensis genome, whereas the fum9 gene is located between fum1 and fum15 genes in A. niger. According to this feature, we designed a primer set, i.e., Fum1_cons_primer (5'-GGCGGCATTGAGATCAGCACATTGGA-3') and Fum15_cons_primer (5'-GAAGGTAACCCGCACAGTAACTGCCAGGCC-3'), to amplify a 1.1-kb gene fragment from the A. luchuensis genome as a template and a 6.0-kb fragment from A. niger (Fig. 5B). Using this primer set, all of the A. luchuensis strains had the same 1.1-kb signal, thereby indicating that A. luchuensis has the same genome structure, and it lacks the ability to produce fumonisin (data not shown). Recently, Shimizu et al. reported that disruption of the fum8 gene, which encodes a-oxoamine synthase, resulted in the loss of fumonisin B2 from A. niger, but A. luchuensis appears to lack this gene.69 Susca et al. suggested that fumonisin production was once more widespread among black aspergilli and that nonrandom partial deletion of this cluster has occurred multiple times based on partial fumonisin gene cluster homologues identified in several black Aspergillus species genomes.70Figure 5Open in new tabDownload slide(A) The fumonisin gene cluster in A. niger CBS 513.88 and the genes around fum1 and fum15 homologues in Aspergillus luchuensis NBRC 3414.

We also confirmed that Nakazawa’s a strain was stored as JCM 2261 (IAM 2112)71 and that it belongs to A. luchuensis. JCM 22320 (IAM 2351) was reported by Sakaguchi in 1949, and it is now known that the kuro koji mold that survived World War II is also A. luchuensis.72 In 1975, Sugama isolated two types of kuro koji mold from awamori koji (awamori type and acid-producing saitoi type), and we confirmed that both of these strains belong to A. luchuensis.73 Tukahara reported that ISH1 (awamori kin, a high glycosidase-producing strain) and ISH2 (saitoi kin, a high acid-producing strain), which are the strains used most widely for awamori fermentation at present, are also A. luchuensis according to next-generation sequencing74 Thus, A. luchuensis had been used historically and widely in awamori production, which clearly indicates that A. luchuensis is most appropriate for making awamori. The genome sequence obtained in this study will provide a platform to help understand the important characteristics of A. luchuensis, such as citric acid production. A transformation system and an efficient gene-targeting system for A. luchuensis have already been established.75 We hope that more advanced molecular biological research will be conducted using the kuro koji mold, A. luchuensis.The sequences and annotations reported in this article have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession nos BCWF01000001-BCWF01000044.

IntroductionAs a collection of genetic information, genomes are thought to be sequence redundant.1 Since the first genome sequence was reported in bacteria,2 experimental and theoretical studies3–8 have attempted to determine the minimal sets of genes essential for cellular life and to define what constitutes a minimal genome.9 A number of sound experiments have succeeded in constructing Escherichia coli libraries either of knockout strains, by deleting particular functional genes,10,11 or of a variety of genome sizes, by removing the non-essential genomic sequences.12–14 Recently, thought-provoking experiments involving synthetic genomes harbouring the smallest gene sets and exhibiting high replication efficiency8,15 have further demonstrated that native genomic sequences are redundant in terms of the capacity for life. As a consequence, genetically engineered genomes lacking dispensable sequences are commonly used in both basic science and applied research.16,17Reduced genomes have both advantages and disadvantages regarding cellular functions,18 although few studies have commented on whether the deleted dispensable genomic sequences contribute to biological fitness. Intensive studies have shown that reduced genomes increase productivity in generating gene products,19–21 which is a major advantage in various applications, and reduce the capacity to take up foreign DNA22 as well as mutability,23,24 which are likely to be disadvantageous to evolving living organisms. These results imply that the deletion of the “junk” regions of the genome increases the efficiency of biological processes but decreases cellular plasticity in living organisms.22 Bioinformatic analysis has successfully linked the genome size to growth conditions.25 However, insight into the relation between genome size and growth fitness is lacking. Although genome reduction has been found not to affect the capacity for growth,12–14,26 experimental and theoretical studies of the global effects of genome reduction on cellular life are required.Considering the reduced genomes as growing systems, the accumulated deletion of dispensable genomic sequences is assumed to be associated with growth rate, a common global parameter that represents the overall activity (output of the genomic and metabolic reactions) of a living cell. Such a global effect of bacterial growth has been demonstrated by the correlation between transcriptome and growth fitness27,28 in both adaptation29,30 and evolution.31 However, studies constructing reduced genomes have reported diverse evidence regarding growth. Rough measurements of a series of reduced genomes (constructed from W3110) have not indicated any significant differences in the growth rate on the basis of optical density (OD),14 whereas a closely related study has reported increased cell division time in another reduced genome library (constructed from MG1655)32. In addition, the well-known “clean” genome (MDS42)12 has a growth rate comparable to that of its parent wild type genome (MG1655) in minimal medium,22,33 and no general trend has been observed between genome size and growth in rich medium.26 Whether and how the genome reduction links to the bacterial growth is still in argument, due to the different thinking on growth cost and/or genome evolution. Thus, the biological impact of genome reduction remains to be determined under different conditions in varied point views. Considering these various findings and assumptions, we sought to quantitatively evaluate the relation between cumulatively reduced genomic sequences and the changes in growth under nutritional variation.In the present study, we addressed the question of whether and how the cumulative deletion of dispensable genomic sequences contributes to the population growth of E. coli in varied conditions. We used a previously constructed E. coli library comprising a series of genomes that were reduced in a stepwise manner,14 and easy access to their genetic backgrounds was crucial for the analysis. Evaluation of the contribution of genomic sequences dispensable for bacterial growth was achieved through comprehensive growth assays of these E. coli strains. The results offer a perspective opinion of the relationship between genome size and growth fitness as a growth mode that is potentially involved in genome evolution and is applicable to genome engineering.2. Materials and methods2.1 Strains and mediaA total of 28 E. coli strains with reduced genomes (KHK collection) and the wild type genome W3110 were obtained from the National BioResource Project, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan. The strains, which were initially cultured and stored in complete LB medium (Miller), were inoculated into M63 minimal medium and re-cultured until the optical density (OD600) reached 0.01~0.1, representing the exponential growth phase. The cell culture was subsequently stored in 20 tubes in small aliquots (100 µl per tube) for future use. Escherichia coli culture stocks (newly prepared single tubes) were used once, and the remainder was discarded. The compositions of the three different media, the complete medium (LB), the minimal medium (M63), and the minimal medium supplemented with 20 amino acids (MAA), used in the present study were described previously.342.2 Acquisition of growth curvesThe E. coli culture stocks were completely dissolved and diluted 10- to 100-fold with fresh media in a test tube. Three types of media, LB, MAA, and M63, were used, which represent the rich, supplementary, and poor growth conditions, respectively. The diluted cell mixtures of multiple dilution rates were subsequently loaded into a 96-well plate (Costar) in three to six wells per dilution rate per strain, with 200 µl of diluted cell mixture applied in each well. The 96-well plate was incubated in a plate reader (Epoch2, BioTek) with a rotation rate of 600 rpm at 37 °C. Cell growth was detected at an absorbance of 600 nm, with readings obtained at 30-min or 1-h intervals for 24 to 48 h. The growth curves were obtained for each well (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Repeated tests were performed, which resulted in 11 to 30 growth curves used for further calculations of growth rate and population density for each strain at each growth condition (medium). Growth curves were acquired in three different media: LB, M63 and MAA.2.3 Calculation of exponential growth rate and saturated population densityHere, Ci and Cj represent the two reads of OD600 values at two continuous time points of tj and ti, which were at intervals of either 0.5 or 1 (h) in the present study. Every four to five continuous growth rates (µ) that exhibited the largest mean and the smallest standard deviation was averaged and taken to be the exponential growth rate of this growth curve (Supplementary Fig. S2). The mean of the exponential growth rates resulting from 11 to 30 replicated growth curves was determined as the exponential growth rate (r) of the corresponding strain and used for the correlation analyses (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The population density was calculated directly from the growth curve by averaging five continuous reads at OD600 that exhibited the largest means (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, the mean of the population densities that result from 11 to 30 replicated growth curves was determined as the saturated population density (K) of the corresponding strain and used for the correlation analyses (Supplementary Fig. S3B).2.4 Measurements of cell concentration and sizeThe E. coli culture stocks were inoculated in 3 ml of M63 minimal medium at a 100-fold dilution and were cultured in a bioshaker (Taitec) with a rotation rate of 200 rpm at 37 °C. Each cell culture was temporally sampled for size measurement from the late exponential to stationary phases. The cell size (diameter) and the corresponding cell concentration were measured using a cell counter (Multisizer™ 4 coulter counter, Beckman) equipped with a 20-µm aperture. Every 50 µl of cell culture, a 5- to 10-fold dilution, if required, was mixed with 10 ml of COULTER ISOTON II DILUENT (Beckman) in a 25-ml disposable vial (Accuvette ST, Beckman) for measurement. The distribution of cell sizes, including the mean, medium and standard deviation of the distribution, were acquired automatically at each measurement (30,000~100,000 cells). Repeated experiments (from cell culture to size measurement) were performed for each strain. The average of multiple values of the measured medium was taken to be the representative cell size of the cell population. The stationary cell sizes were determined as the cell size acquired at concentrations >1 × 109 cells/ml, individually. Six to eight measurements during stationary phase were obtained for each strain, and the average of these measurements was applied to the analysis.2.5 Evaluation of growth dynamicsA total of 1,060 growth curves were rescaled to be comparable (Supplementary Fig. S5). For all growth curves, the intervals between the start of growth over the measurement under-limit and the time required to achieve the maximum OD600 value were standardized to a value ranging from 0 to 100. The start of the growth phase was defined as the time when the increase of OD600 was observed in five consecutive reading points. In addition, OD600 values were also standardized to a value ranging from 0 to 1, by dividing each value on a curve by individual maximum OD600 value. The rescaled growth rates were calculated by taking differences between consecutive two reading points on rescaled growth curves, and the timing of the maximal growth rate was regarded as the standardized timing of the maximal growth rate. This value indicates when the cells most grew most efficiently, and comparing distributions of the values between strains provides insights into the differences in growth characteristics.2.6 Multiple linear regression analysisThe data set comprising the growth rate, the length of accumulated deletions, the population size, the angle from ori to dif, and the growth medium was subjected to multiple linear regression analysis. In this data set, only the growth media (M) was a categorical variable (i.e. LB, MAA and M63) and was included in the multiple regression model by dummy coding. Thus, an artificial variable, as a dummy variable (or indicator variable), was created to represent the variation of M (= LB, MAA or M63) and was introduced to the multiple regression analysis. To increase the regression efficiency, regression variable selection was performed on the basis of AIC (Akaike Information Criteria),35 which evaluated the relative quality of regression models for the data set.36 Computational analyses were performed with R,37 and a 3D-plot was created by using the car package.382.7 Organization and graphics of reduced genomesInformation on the deleted genomic sequences (genomic position and deletion ID) was obtained from the website http://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/strain/, which distributed the E. coli strains (KHK collection). The accumulated length of deleted genomic sequences was calculated. The numbers of deleted genes and the corresponding gene categories,39 which is the only gene function classification that covering the complete gene set across the whole E. coli genome (Supplementary Table S2, 100% assigned function), were determined (Supplementary Table S1) and subjected to the correlation analysis, as previously described.30 Graphical representations of the reduced genomes were created using the BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator) tool.403. Results and discussion3.1 Reduced genomes: a stepwise loss of dispensable genomic sequencesAn assortment of E. coli strains with reduced genomes was used to evaluate the contribution of dispensable genomic sequences to cell growth. A total of 29 E. coli strains, assigned as No. 0 for the wild type genome W3110 and Nos. 1 to 28 for the reduced genomes constructed in a stepwise manner from W3110,14 were investigated. Note that the reduction of genome size was in a complete cumulative mode, i.e. the strain No. 2 maintained the deletion in No. 1, and No. 3 remained the deletions in No. 2, and so on, as illustrated (Fig. 1A). According to the patterns of multiple deletions that occurred in the reduced genomes, the length of multiple deletions accumulated in each genome was calculated. The results revealed a gradual increase in the length of deleted genomic sequences from ~48 to 982 kb (Fig. 1B). In addition, the genes located in the deleted regions were clustered according to the gene categories (summarized in Supplementary Table S1) and subjected to enrichment analysis to identify the significant loss of gene function in each strain (reduced genomes), as previously reported.29,30,31 Bimodal tests revealed that the deleted genomic sequences were most significantly enriched in the gene category of phage/IS-related function (h) (Supplementary Fig. S1), thus verifying that the deleted sequences were mostly non-essential. Note that all deleted genes are designated as the accessory genes in the present study, to avoid the debated definitions of essential and non-essential. Whether and how the dispensable genomic sequences contribute to cell growth in both poor and rich conditions were subsequently investigated. Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideReduced genomes.

Repeated measurements of the E. coli strains that were grown under three different nutritional conditions, resulted in 1,060 independent growth curves. The growth rates during exponential phase and the saturated cell densities during stationary phase were manually calculated for each growth curve (Supplementary Fig. S2). A data set of the exponential growth rates and saturated cell densities associated with reduced genomes was acquired (Supplementary Fig. S3). Statistical tests indicated a highly significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the exponential growth rate and the length of cumulatively deleted genomic sequences in all three nutritional conditions (Fig. 2A). Genome reduction-induced growth decreases were clearly detected. In addition, the mode of growth decrease was nutritional dependent. In comparison to a continuous gradual decrease in the poor condition (M63), a stepwise decrease in the rich condition (LB) was detected, close to the finding reported recently.26 The variation in mode of growth decrease reflected the degree of requirement of dispensable genomic sequences for efficient growth.

The left and right panels represent the normalized decease in growth rate and the normalized decease in saturated cell density, respectively. Red, green and blue represent the growth in LB, MAA and M63, respectively.A correlation was also observed between the saturated cell density and accumulated deletions (P < 0.05); namely, an increase in deleted length was correlated with a decrease in cell density (Fig. 2B). The reduced cell density appeared to be attributed to the reduced number of cells; however, the loss of dispensable genomic sequences influenced the cell size at the saturated concentration (Fig. 3). Because the cell density was evaluated through OD measurements, the number or the size of the cells could contribute to the changes in turbidity. Measurement of the saturated culture in M63, in which the most significant decrease in turbidity was observed, revealed that the cumulative deletions triggered the decrease in cell concentration (Fig. 3B) and the increase in cell size (Fig. 3C) at the saturated phase. Nevertheless, a positive correlation between the cell density evaluated by optical measurement and the cell concentration according to the numbers (particles) of cells (Fig. 3A) confirmed the association “between accumulative genomic deletion and population decrease.

Although the dispensable genomic sequences were non-essential for life, the length-dependent changes illustrated the slight but significant contribution of the accumulated loss of these sequences to bacterial growth.3.3 The degree of change in population growth was nutritional dependentHere, Ld, r and K represent the length of the accumulated deletions (kb), the normalized growth rate and the cell density, respectively. The constants a and ß indicate the magnitudes of the decrease in population growth in relation to the length of multiple deletions. In three different media, the slopes of aM63, aMAA and aLB were 5e-4, 1e-4 and 9e-5 per kb, respectively (Fig. 2C, left). The slopes of ßM63, ßMAA and ßLB were 2e-4, 1e-4 and 7e-5 per kb, respectively (Fig. 2C, right). Thus, every 1-kb deletion would cause a 0.05%, 0.01%, and 0.009% fitness decrease and a 0.02%, 0.01%, and 0.007% population reduction in the conditions of M63, MAA, and LB, respectively. Both a and ß exhibited gradual changes in the order of the richness of growth media, thus indicating that the extent of the length-dependent changes in population growth was nutritional dependent. The deleted genomic sequences affected both the growth fitness (r) and the environmental capacity (K), and this effect was more substantial in poor environments.Here, CM and kM represent the medium-dependent population capacity and correlation, respectively. Although a positive correlation between population size and growth fitness could be estimated (kM > 0), significant correlations were identified in the conditions of M63 and LB (P < 0.01) but not MAA (Supplementary Fig. S4). It might because of the relatively low significance in the correlation between the saturated cell density and genome reduction in MAA (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that the nutritionally differentiated bias in the relationships among growth parameters is likely to be related to genomic deletions.3.4 Accumulated deletions also caused correlated changes in growth dynamicsIn addition to the speed (r) and the maximum (K) of population growth, the patterns of growth dynamics were also observed in correlated changes (Fig. 4) evaluated by rescaling the growth curves (Supplementary Fig. S5). The saturated cell density was rescaled in a common unit such that it had an increased effect on the low K and r in the reduced genomes. If the growth dynamics was similar, the rescaling would lead to the overlapped growth curves of all strains despite the variation in the raw growth curves (Supplementary Fig. S5). That is, the time required to achieve the maximal growth rate (t), which was considered a representative parameter of growth dynamics, should be equivalent. However, the analysis resulted in high variation in the timing and the negative correlations between the averaged timing (t) and the deleted length (Ld) in all three media (P < 0.005) (Fig. 4). The accumulative deletion caused the changes in growth patterns; i.e. the time from the growth initiation to the highest growth efficiency was increased, and the time from the maximal growth rate to the population saturation was decreased. Because growth is thought to be controlled by metabolic reactions, the global biochemical reactions achieved the highest efficacy more slowly and shut down more rapidly. These findings implied that the deleted sequences participated in metabolic efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, the qualities of life processes (e.g. growth fitness, metabolic activity) are associated with the quantity of genetic material (i.e. genomic length).

Multiple deletions might disturb the symmetry of genome replication and cause growth changes. To avoid over regression, model selection among the five predictors (Ld, K, M, t, <U+03B8>) according to Akaike Information Criteria35 was applied. The results showed that the most efficient regression (adjusted R2, 0.9818) was achieved by choosing Ld, M and <U+03B8> (Supplementary Table S3). Rejection of K and t from the growth prediction suggested the multicollinearity among K, t and Ld, consistently with the previous discussion (Equations 2~5 and Fig. 5).

Colour planes and spheres represent the predicted and the experimental values, respectively. Residuals between the predicted and the experimental values are represented by the lines from spheres to the corresponding plane.The predicted growth rates were similar to those acquired experimentally (Fig. 4). Notably, the additional introduction of the angle to the regression model improved the prediction accuracy (Supplementary Table S1). However, the direct comparison between the angle and growth changes did not detect any significant correlation (P > 0.1, Supplementary Fig. S6). The slight but positive contribution of <U+03B8> to r appeared to increase the prediction accuracy. Thus, the deterministic factors for growth fitness included genome reduction and growth conditions. Although the mechanism of the predictable growth changes was unclear and the theoretical relation might be strain- or reduction-mode-dependent, the present findings reveal a novel quantitative principle involved in the bacterial genome as a propagating machine.3.6 A hypothesis connecting genome reduction with growth changesGiven that there are dispensable regions in bacterial genomes, harbouring the accessory genes involved in genome evolution,41,42 we propose a hypothesis to explain the correlation between accumulative genomic reduction and gradual growth changes, particularly in severe environments (Fig. 6A). First, the length-dependent changes may be explained by considering genome evolution as a molecular clock.43 Genome evolution should promote an enlarged genome size by incorporating non-essential accessory genes (e.g. horizontal gene transfer, HGT),44,45 which might be disadvantageous for the growth fitness, given the additional cost for the replication and expression of the newly acquired sequences. Nevertheless, the evolutionary selection on genomic sequences was based on growth fitness. The enlarged genome size was subsequently optimized (e.g. mutagenesis) to generate novel genetic interactions for beneficial cooperation from the new sequences (i.e. accessory genes) to achieve the growth recovery (fitness increase). Thus, the wild type genome was the evolutionary consequence representing a balance between the additional cost and the novel cooperation, as well as a balanced distribution of accessory genes in genome. Given that genomic sequence elongation correlates with the evolutionary period (clock), the deletion-length dependent fitness decrease is reasonable. Second, multiple deletions of the evolved genomic sequence in the laboratory clearly disturbed the cooperative accessory networks formed during evolution, thus leading to decreased fitness regardless of the remaining growing capacity. Additional steps for sequence optimization or complete systematic reduction of accessory networks was required to retain the growth fitness of the small genome, thus potentially explaining why the reduced genome MDS42 grew as fast as the wild type genome did in minimal medium.12,22,33 Because MDS42 exhibited a fixed periodicity for efficient growth in the transcriptome33 and the sequence differences from the MG1655 counterpart ranging from single nucleotide substitutions to complete deletions,46 we assumed that either a successful systematic loss of accessory networks or the sequence optimization owing to the serial transfer was achieved.

Gene categories are noted in both full names and abbreviations.A supportive line of evidence was that the gene function correlation analysis did not detect any single gene category that was specifically responsible for the changes in population growth (Fig. 6B). We analysed whether any gene categories specifically contributed to the decrease in growth rate. The gene categories comprising >10 deleted genes in strain No. 28 (independent of the significance evaluated in Supplementary Fig. S1) were subjected to the evaluation. The correlations between the decreasing growth rates from strain No. 1 to 28 (Fig. 2A) and the increasing numbers of deleted genes in each gene categories (Supplementary Table S1, 14 out of 23 gene categories) were evaluated. High significance (P < 0.001) was detected in all 14 gene categories under the conditions of M63 and LB, thus indicating that all gene categories contributed to the growth decrease in both rich and poor nutritional conditions. The addition of 20 amino acids (MAA) decreased the significance of such correlation, thus suggesting that these amino acids compensated for the loss of the genes broadly classified in not only the central gene categories of Enzyme (e), Structural component (s), and Regulator (r), but also the accessory gene categories of Unknown function (o), Phage/IS (h), Pseudogenes (su) and predicted functions (pf, pr). Although a single accessory gene might have an undetectable contribution to the growth (~0.03–0.001%), a cluster of these genes might reach a quantitatively predictive level regardless of the variation in gene categories and/or functional mechanisms. Note that other gene function analyses failed to acquire any significant correlated contribution, which was largely due to the missing functional assignment of the deleted accessory genes (Supplementary Table S2). The broad but not specific correlations between the gene category and the growth rate not only explained the finding of that the growth rate could be predicted on the basis of the accumulatively deleted length alone but also supported the assumption in which evolutionary sequence optimization can build the functional interactions involving accessory genes and thus result in increased fitness.In summary, the accumulative loss of dispensable genomic sequences contributes to bacterial growth in a dose-dependent manner, significantly in poor conditions. The data sets and the theoretical underpinnings suggest a quantitative linkage between genomic sequences and growth fitness and should be valuable in understanding genome evolution and constructing the desired genome for a growing system.We thank the National BioResource Project and the National Institute of Genetics (Shizuoka, Japan) for providing the E. coli strains and our lab members for fruitful discussions.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) no. 26506003 (to BWY) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas no. 26119702 (to BWY) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

IntroductionOil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacquin) is a monoecious species in the family Arecaceae.1 It originates from West Africa and is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. Oil palm does not produce offshoots, and its propagation is by sowing the seeds. Commercial plantation of oil palm commenced on the West African coast and in Southeast Asia. Plantations of oil palm help to provide cooking oil and fuel to many developing countries. There are three major and different forms/varieties in the species E. guineensis: Dura, Pisifera and Tenera.1 The majority of oil palm trees planted for oil production in Asia are the offspring of four Dura trees brought from Africa to Asia in 1848 and a few Pisifera trees imported to Asia from Africa.1 The hybrid Tenera form, generated by crossing the Dura (<U+2640>) and Pisifera (<U+2642>) forms, shows a yield advantage (hybrid vigor) of 25% over the pure Dura form; hence, it is preferred for plantations. It is generally believed that the SHELL gene is the major gene controlling oil yield.2 Conventional breeding and changes in plantation management in the past 60 years have improved quality traits and also elevated the crude palm oil (CPO) yield from 2.0 to 4.1 tons/hectare/year.3 As the estimated potential CPO yield of the crop may be as high as 18 tons of oil per hectare/year,4 there is substantial potential to increase CPO yield. Besides E. guineensis, another palm species, Elaeis oleifera, has been used to produce oil in South and Central America.1,E. oleifera diverged from E. guineensis as long as 51 Myr ago.5 However, its oil yield is much lower than that of E. guineensis while its oil quality is better.1 A natural E. oleifera × E. guineensis hybrid was found in Costa Rica. Palms with a short trunk and short leaves, known as Compact, have been developed by repeated backcrossing of this palm with E. guineensis.6 The improved Compact palm is expected to be commercially exploited in Southeast Asia in the future due to its high oil quality and short trunk.Genetic variation is the basis of genetic improvement. The draft genomes of Pisifera form of the species E. guineensis, and another species E. oleifera oil palm are available.5 The genome size of oil palm is 1.8 Gb.5 The genome sequence of the Dura form in the species E. guineensis has not been reported yet. Considerable efforts have been made to understand the genetic variation in oil palms.7–9 However, information about genome-wide genetic variation is still lacking. The purpose of this study was to obtain a whole genome sequence of an elite Dura palm and genome-wide overview of genetic variation in oil palms including Compact palms. We sequenced the genome of an elite palm Dura from a breeding population and re-sequenced the genomes of 17 palm trees from Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America. The draft genome sequence of Dura is 1.701 Gb, containing 36,015 genes. Re-sequencing additional 17 palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We have mapped over 10,000 SNPs to the linkage map of oil palm. Our data provide a valuable resource to accelerate oil palm genetic improvement and to investigate mechanisms underlying phenotypic variations of important traits (e.g. oil yield and quality, disease resistance) in oil palms.2. Materials and methodsMethods and any associated references are available in Supplementary Materials. Here we only presented the major methods.2.1. Genome sequencing, assembly and quality assessmentHigh-quality genomic DNA was extracted from leaf samples of a Dura elite palm D1 (Supplementary Table S1), from a breeding program of Wilmar International Ltd. Plantation, using plant DNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted DNA was treated with RNase A and proteinase K to remove RNA and protein contamination, respectively, and the DNA further precipitated with ethanol. Illumina short-insert paired-end (size: 300 bp) and long-insert mate-pair (3–5, 10 and 20 kb) libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions. The template DNA fragments were sequenced using the Illumina HighSeq 2500 and Miseq. For Roche 454 sequencing, library construction and sequencing were conducted following the recommendations of Roche.We developed a comprehensive pipeline (Supplementary Fig. S1) and used it to assemble the Dura oil palm genome (Details see Supplementary Materials). The Pisifera palm genome5 was used as a reference genome for the assembly. Our pipeline included five components: (i) de novo assembly, (ii) mis-assembly scaffold identification and correction, (iii) alignment to reference genome, (iv) repeat scaffold identification, and (v) solution of overlapping scaffolds.We evaluated the quality of the genome assembly using three methods, including expressed sequence tag (EST) coverage, completeness of genome and coverage of markers in linkage maps. We checked EST coverage. A total of 41,695 ESTs which were collected from oil palm leaf and mesocarp tissues were used to assess the gene coverage of this draft oil palm genome. ESTs were aligned to the genome by BLAT. Only ESTs with alignments of identity=0.9 were retained. We analysed the completeness of the draft genome of Dura palm. A computational method CEGMA,10 which defined a set of much conserved protein families that occur in a wide range of eukaryotes, was adopted to check the completeness of our draft genome. The completeness of each genome could be measured by the number of conserved proteins defined by the program. The existing marker dataset from oil palm was used to evaluate the quality of our draft genome. In our study, the accuracy of each scaffold and mapping of the scaffolds into real chromosomes were determined by linkage maps. This was done by examining the number of known markers which could be found in our draft genome. We used 256 SSR markers mapped by Billotte et al.11 and 454 SSR markers mapped by ourselves12 to investigate the completeness of the draft genome.2.2. Genome annotation and identification of gene synteny and whole genome duplicationWe annotated repeats, gene and ncRNA using a number of software (details see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). We attempted to identify gene synteny and whole genome duplication. To generate a pair-wise alignment of gene models between oil palm and grape, oil palm and soybean, and oil palm and date palm all predicted gene models were aligned to the respective reference gene models using the software MUMmer.13 The criterion used was that the number of genes in one synteny block should be more than 5.2.3. Re-sequencing the genomes of 17 additional oil palm treesAfter assembling the draft genome for the elite Dura palm tree D1, we also collected samples from oil palm trees from the major plantation area (i.e. Southeast Asia), its place of origin (i.e. Africa) and Central America for re-sequencing. From the collection of oil palms across the world, we selected 13 trees from three forms (i.e. Dura, Pisifera and Tenera) of the species E. guineensis, which included the elite Dura tree D1 used in generating the draft genome (see details in Supplementary Table S1). In addition, we also selected five trees of the Compact palm for re-sequencing, which is a hybrid between the two species E. guineensis, and E. oleifera and expected to be exploited in Southeast Asia in the future. We re-sequenced the genomes of 17 trees using paired-end sequencing using the Illumina HighSeq 2500 as described earlier. The sequencing depth of each whole genome was around 5–8-fold (Supplementary Table S1).2.4. Detection of SNPs and genetic variations in 18 palm treesFor the 18 accessions of oil palm trees we sequenced, SNPs were called in three steps: (i). All reads were aligned to our assembled draft genome using Bowtie14 with the default setting. (ii). The SNPs were then called with SAMtools.15 (iii) And then four thresholds (i.e. Samtool_pileup SNP score =30, Read sequence depth for this allele =10, The minimum distance for adjacent SNPs =10 bp and Only one polymorphism detected at each SNP location) were used to post-filter unreliable SNPs:To explore the various information of SNPs in different groups: Dura, Pisifera, Tenera and Compact, we compared the following information for different groups. (i) Location information for each SNP: intergenic region, UTR, intron, exon, CDS, downstream (length: 5 Kb), upstream (length 5 K). (ii) Coding feature: NON_Synonymous_coding (SNP causing a codon change that produces a different amino acid), Synonymous_coding (SNP causing a codon change that produces the same amino acid). (iii) Codon level: Codon_change (one or many codons are changed), Codon_Insert (one or many codons are inserted), Codon_deletion (one or many codons are deleted), Exon_deleted (a deletion that removes the whole exon), Start_Lost (the start codon is mutated into a non-start codon), Synonymous_start (the start codon is mutated into another start codon), Synonymous_stop (the stop codon is mutated into another stop codon), Stop_lost (the stop codon is mutated into a non-stop codon).To analyse the genetic relationship between different oil palm trees, two methods were used to construct the phylogenic trees. For the first method, SNPs were first used to calculate the genetic distances between different accessions/strains of oil palm.16 Next, a Neighbour-Joining method was used to construct the phylogenetic tree on the basis of the distance matrix, calculated by the software PHYLIP (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). Finally, MEGA417 was used to visualize the phylogenetic tree. For the second method, we used TreeMix18 to infer the population evolution history.We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) following the procedure as reported.19 The eigenvector decomposition of the genotype data was performed by the eigen function in R. The whole program was provided by the SNPrelate package in R.20 After excluding SNPs from individuals that had missing data, the remaining SNPs were used to construct the population structure using the program STRUCTURE.21 The length of the burn-in period and the number of MCMC reps after burn in were set to default value. The number of populations was set from 3 to 7. We estimated FST, pbetween, and pwithin to examine population differentiation using vcftools.152.5. Detection of LD and identification of selection signaturesWe explored haplotype patterns in different oil palm strains using the SNP dataset. Correlation coefficient (r2) of alleles was calculated to measure the LD level in three groups: Dura, Pisifera and Tenera, using Haploview.22 The same parameters as soybean23 were set: -maxdistance 1000 –dprime –minMAF 0.1 –hwcutoff 0.01. The average r2 value was calculated for each length of distance and LD decay figures were drawn by R for different groups of oil palm.We used the rehh24 package in R to identify selection signatures on the oil palm genome. The integrated haplotype Score (iHS) is a measure of the amount of extended haplotype homozygosity at a given SNP along the ancestral allele relative to the derived allele.25 The RSB score measured the difference between two different populations based on iHS scores.263. Results3.1. Sequencing and assembly of the Dura palm genomeWe sequenced the genome of one Dura tree using Illumina HighSeq 2500, Miseq and Roche 454, and obtained 211 Gb raw data. After removing low-quality data, we assembled the genome using 171 Gb high quality sequences (Supplementary Table S2). The assembled draft genome was 1.701 Gb, containing 10,971 scaffolds with an N50 size of 0.76 Mb. The longest scaffold was 22.37 Mb (Table 1). The draft genome sequence covered 94.49% of the oil palm genome based on that the genome size of oil palm is 1.8 Gb.5Statistics of the genome sequence assembly of a Dura oil palmStatistics of the genome sequence assembly of a Dura oil palmWe evaluated the accuracy of the genome assembly by BLASTing the assembled genomic DNA sequence of Dura against the draft genome of Pisifera.5 85.6% of the Dura genome sequences are identical to the Pisifera genome sequences, suggesting that most of our assembled sequences are consistent with the Pisifera genome.We checked the completeness of the draft Dura genome by using three independent approaches. First, we used the public EST database27 to examine the gene coverage of this draft genome. The draft genome had a high coverage (~80%) of protein coding genome regions (Supplementary Table S3). Second, we found that of the 248 highly conserved proteins defined in CEGMA,10 around 87% of them can be found in our draft genome. Third, using DNA markers mapped on published linkage maps of oil palm,11,12 710 SSR markers (Supplementary Fig. S2) were aligned to the draft genome using BWA28 with only one mismatch. About 98% of the total number of available markers could be successfully aligned to our draft genome. Taken together, our data suggest that the draft Dura genome has a relatively high completeness. The missing portions of the Dura palm genome may be highly repetitive and thus difficult to assemble using our sequence dataset and current assembly method.3.2. Annotation of the Dura genomeDe novo and homology-based gene prediction were carried out using repeat masked scaffolds. These two gene sets were then merged to form a comprehensive and non-redundant reference gene set by MAKER2.29 A total of 36,015 gene models were predicted. 75.8% of them predicted protein-coding genes showing significant sequence similarity to known genes deposited in public databases (e.g. NCBI non-redundant database30). The GC content of the protein coding genes was 39.00% whereas that for the assembled draft genome was 36.80%. The average gene length was 3,573 bp (Supplementary Table S4).The species which has the highest gene sequence homology with our Dura sample is grape (Vitis vinifera)31 (Supplementary Fig. S3), a eudicotyledonous crop, followed by another monocotyledonous crop, Oryza sativa.32 This kind of high amino acid sequence similarity with a phylogenetically unrelated plant (the oil palm is monocotyledonous while the grapevine is eudicotyledonous) has also been observed in the date palm33 and in proteins encoded by oil palm ESTs.34 We do not know the exact reasons for this relationship. Sequencing more plant species may give a clear answer about this relationship.In the assembled genome, repetitive sequences accounted for 14.37% (Supplementary Table S5) whereas unassembled repeats and gaps accounted for around 27.81%. Thus, repeat sequences accounted for 42.18% of the draft genome, which is similar to that of the Pisifera genome.5 Among the repetitive sequences, retroelements were most abundant (7.96%), followed by low complexity repeats (3.84%), simple repeats (1.00%) and tandem repeats (0.69%) (Supplementary Table S5). Satellites were least abundant (0.001%).In addition, we identified genes for non-coding RNAs in the Dura palm draft genome (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). A total of 636 genes for tRNAs and 1,182 genes for rRNAs were detected. The number of tRNA genes is similar to the 699 tRNA genes for Arabidopsis35 and 606 for sorghum.36 It is interesting that one tRNA selenocysteine gene was detected in the oil palm genome. This gene was previously only found in maize,37 sorghum36 and bamboo,38 but absent in Oryza sativa,32,Arabidopsis thaliana35 and date palm.33 The specific function of this tRNA needs further investigation. We also identified genes for 199 known miRNA families (Supplementary Table S7).3.3. Diversity and divergence between palms from Southeast Asia and AfricaRe-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs (Table 2). The heterozygosity rate in oil palms was 1.01% (i.e. one SNPs in 99.2 bp), which is higher than that in soybean (0.57%)23 and in date palm (0.47%).33 The genetically improved Dura and Pisifera palms used in producing the hybrid Tenera in Southeast Asia showed the lowest number of SNPs and genetic diversity (Table 2) as compared with the Tenera palms collected in Africa. The total distribution of genome wide diversity was lower for Dura and Pisifera compared with Tenera (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the Dura and Pisifera trees from Southeast Asia contained 1,419 and 341 form-specific SNPs respectively (Fig. 2). The genomic diversity in Compact palms from Central America was lower than that in Tenera from Africa (Table 2 and Fig. 1).

The phylogenetic tree showed that four Dura trees (D1, D2, D3, and D4) from Southeast Asia and two hybrid Tenera trees (T1 and T2) from Africa formed a subclade, whereas the five Compact palms (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) from Central America formed another subclade. The three Pisifera trees (P1, P2, and P3) from Southeast Asia and four hybrid Tenera (T3, T4, T5, and T6) from Africa constituted other subclades. A PCA gave similar results (Fig. 3B). Using the software STRUCTURE,39 with k between 3 and 7, subpopulations were detected among trees from Southeast Asia and Africa (Supplementary Fig. S4). As the average value of Ln likelihood was the highest when K= 4, we presented the results of the analysis at K = 4 (Fig. 3C). We found that several trees showed evidence of admixture, especially the Tenera group (Fig. 3A–C), which is generally in agreement with the fact that Tenera is the hybrid generated by crossing Dura and Pisifera trees. These data indicate that there is substantial genetic differentiation among palms used for breeding and plantations in Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America, and that the Compact palms are quite different from Dura, Pisifera and Tenera, which may be because the Compact palm is the hybrid between two palm species (i.e. E. guineensis and E. oleifera) of palm.6,40Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideAnalysis of the phylogenetic relationship, population structure and LD decay in oil palm trees.

High LD in the oil palm genomeTo obtain an overview of the genome-wide LD patterns in oil palm, we used the software SAMtools15 for LD analysis. In general, Dura, Pisifera, Tenera and Compact palms showed very high LD (Fig. 1D). The average distance over which LD decayed to 50% of its maximum value in oil palm was > 200 kb, which is substantially longer than the distance reported in any other crop (e.g. 75–150 kb in soybean,41 < 1 Kb in maize and rice,32,37 3–4 kb in A. thaliana35). Unlike humans and livestock, agronomic plant species usually show very short LD.35,37,41 Therefore, oil palm may be a good object to study effects of long LD on genome evolution and population structure. In addition, the results of LD analysis showed that the LD patterns in palms from different locations were different. The Dura palms displayed the most LD, followed by Pisifera, Tenera and Compact palms (Fig. 1D). The very high LD in oil palms, especially among trees from Southeast Asia, implies that LD mapping is likely to be practical in oil palms. Therefore, only a small set of SNPs covering the whole genome would be required to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for important traits for marker-assisted selection (MAS). By using the published linkage maps12 and in-silico mapping,42 over 10,000 detected SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Materials) were mapped to 16 linkage groups, supplying a useful resource for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and GWAS for traits.3.5. Signatures of selection, and positive selection on R genes of oil palmAnalysis of Fst revealed that some regions of the genome showed much higher values of Fst than most other regions (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that these regions may contain genes under positive selection during the breeding of palms in different regions. Similarly, we also explored the iHS score across the whole genome (Supplementary Fig. S6) and detected conserved regions in the genomes of palms from different geographical locations, suggesting that these regions may be essential for maintaining the basic biological functions of palms. By comparing the iHS score of Dura with Tenera (Supplementary Fig. S7), and Pisifera with Tenera (Supplementary Fig. S8), across the whole draft genome, some interesting gene candidates were found to be under positive selection, such as the gene for asparagine synthase-like protein in chromosome 5, which has been reported to be related to the height of oil palms.12 Other interesting gene candidates, such as fatty acid desaturase and disease-resistance genes (R genes), were also under positive selection. Special attention should be paid to these genes in future breeding efforts.The genes encoding proteins accounted for around 7% of the oil palm genome. However, only about 2% of the total SNPs were found to be present in these regions. The remaining (~98%) SNPs were found in non-coding regions (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S9). The average Ka/Ks ratio in oil palms was 1.4 (Table 1), which is among the highest out of all plants reported so far (1.31–1.61 in soybean,23 1.2 in rice32 and 0.83 in A. thaliana35). We further analysed gene functional categories using genes whose Ka/Ks ratios were significantly different from the average ratio of all genes in the palm genome. We found that gene families with essential functions (e.g. mRNA translation and maintenance of protein location in the nucleus) tended to have substantially lower substitution ratios (X2 test, P < .01) (Supplementary Fig. S10), which is in agreement with the finding in soybean23 and bacteria.43. In contrast, gene families that function in regulatory processes, such as fatty acid metabolic processes, R genes, and steroid biosynthetic processes, had higher ratios (Supplementary Fig. S11), similar to previous findings in Arabidopsis35 and soybean.23A total of 566 R genes (Supplementary Table S8) were identified from the Dura genome, substantially less than the number of 1,085 in the genome of rice, whose genome size is only 25% of oil palm.32 The average Ka/Ks ratio of R genes was 1.7, much higher than that (1.4) of all genes in the palm genome, suggesting a strong positive selection of R genes in palms. Based on conserved encoded protein domains, these R genes were distributed into 10 different groups (Supplementary Table S8). We found that the CNL, TNL and FLS groups had a higher Ka/Ks ratio than the average ratio of all R genes. Among the 50 genes with the highest Ka/Ks ratio in the sequenced oil palm genomes, 17 were putative R genes and these had an average Ka/Ks ratio of 3.4. DiscussionWe sequenced, assembled and annotated the genome of one elite palm Dura. Evaluation by three independent methods (i.e. EST coverage, genome completeness and linkage map) demonstrated the accuracy and completeness of our draft genome for the Dura tree. Previously published genomes of the Pisifera palms and E. oleifera5 have provided important genetic resources for oil palm breeding. Here, we present the first draft genome of the Dura palm. In comparison to the published draft genome of a Pisifera tree,43 the draft genome of our Dura tree covers more of the palm genome. The draft genome sequence of the Dura tree and its annotations, in combination with the draft genomes of Pisifera and E. oleifera palms, should facilitate further research on oil palm biology. We note, however, that there are still over 10 thousand scaffolds for the draft Dura genome. Filling in the gaps and connecting the scaffolds to make a well-assembled genome is an important task for the future.Genetic variation is the basis of selective breeding for genetic improvement, and is also the safeguard from future challenges (e.g. emerging diseases and climate change). By sequencing 18 palm trees from Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America, we identified over 18 million SNPs, and revealed a low genetic diversity among Dura palms in Southeast Asia. Similarly, in comparison to the Tenera palms from Africa, the Pisifera palms from Southeast Asia contained a lower number of SNPs and genome diversity. These results indicate that the elite Dura and Pisifera palms used in commercial production/breeding in Southeast Asia contain only a part of the genetic variation in oil palms. To broaden the genetic diversity of oil palm in Southeast Asia, it is essential to import germplasm from Africa. Meanwhile, we found that the elite Dura and Pisifera palms used in producing the hybrid Tenera for large scale plantations in Southeast Asia contained a number of form-specific SNPs. It is well known that the average oil yield of oil palms in Southeast Asia is much higher than that in Africa due to the extensive selective breeding for oil yield in Southeast Asia.1 Therefore, these form-specific alleles in the elite Dura and Pisifera palms in Southeast Asia may be useful in improving the production performances of oil palms in Africa. Taken together, our data suggest that exchange of oil palm germplasm could benefit both Southeast Asia and Africa for future improvements of this important oil crop. The Compact palm, a hybrid between E. oleifera and E. guineensis, has the potential to become a new form of palm for plantation in Southeast Asia due to its high oil quality and lower trunk, which makes the harvest easier.1 This study showed that genetic diversity in the Compact palms was lower than that in the Tenera palms.1 Therefore, to ensure sustainability of plantation of the Compact palm, more individuals should be imported from Central America. Genotyping of palms with the identified SNPs could help to identify source materials for import and exchange.Although the average CPO yield of oil palm has already reached 4.1 tons/ha/year, there is still huge room for increase to its estimated maximum yield (18 tons/ha/year).4 The availability of the sequence data and the selection of over 10,000 SNPs covering the 16 linkage groups of the whole Dura palm genome, will facilitate mapping of QTL and GWAS for important traits, thus accelerating genetic improvement in oil palms. The very high LD in oil palms suggests that in oil palms compared with other agronomic crops, MAS could be a better choice whereas positional cloning of genes encoding important traits could be more challenging.Diseases are a major factor in determining yield in oil palm plantations. Diagnosis and prevention or cure of diseases, as well as selection of palms resistant to diseases, have proven to be difficult. To combat diseases, DNA markers could be used to search for disease resistance genes within the E. guineensis genome. We identified 566 R genes in oil palms. The number of R genes in oil palms is less than that in other plants,32,36,37 but they are more variable. We postulate that the extreme diversity and rapid evolution of R genes may compensate for the relative low number of R genes in palm trees in comparison to other plants, and provide a higher capacity to protect them against challenges from diverse pathogens. Further detailed functional characterization of R genes may render them useful in reducing the impact of pathogens on oil palm production.Accession codesShort-read genomic sequence data from this project have been deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan under the accession no.

IntroductionQuinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is an annual herbaceous plant that originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family, which also includes sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.).1,2 The major area of quinoa cultivation ranges from Columbia to central Chile,3,4 and includes altitudes from sea level up to 4,000 m above sea level5 and annual rainfalls of 80 mm to 2,000 mm.1,2,6 Quinoa is therefore well adapted to grow under adverse climatic and soil conditions7 and displays high tolerance to drought,8,9 soil salinity,10,11 and frost.12 Furthermore, quinoa is an exceptional nutritional source of a wide spectrum of minerals (e.g. Ca, Fe, Mg, P, and Zn), vitamins (e.g. A, B1, B2, B9, C, and E), dietary fiber, linolenate, natural antioxidants (e.g. polyphenols), and high-quality protein, containing high levels of essential amino acids, particularly methionine and lysine.13–16 Being gluten-free, quinoa is suitable for consumption by individuals who are allergic or intolerant to wheat.14 Owing to the outstanding nutritional value of quinoa seeds and the great adaptability of quinoa plants to adverse environments, quinoa is considered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to be an important crop with the potential to contribute to food security worldwide.17 Moreover, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA (NASA) deems quinoa as an optimal food source for astronauts on long-term space missions in isolated conditions.18Quinoa has been cultivated in the Andes for several thousand years.2 Although quinoa cultivation was forbidden during the Spanish Conquest of South America in the sixteenth century, quinoa is cultivated in over 50 countries today.2,19 Indeed, several thousand quinoa accessions are stored in germplasm banks.2 Although quinoa is considered to be a predominantly autogamous (i.e. self-pollinated) species, multiple reports indicate that quinoa accessions are genetically heterogeneous due to outcrossing based on carrying two kinds of flowers on the same plant.2,20 Nevertheless, no inbred quinoa accessions have been reported to date, and this is problematic because molecular genetics and biology studies of quinoa rely on the development of an inbred quinoa line.Quinoa is an allotetraploid species (2n = 4x = 36 with a genome size of 1,448 Mbp)21,22 that consists of two distinct genomes, A and B.23 Genetic mapping of quinoa has been conducted using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers,1 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers,1 and array-platform markers.24 However, the most recent quinoa map contains just 511 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites and does not span the entire quinoa genome.24 To obtain a sufficient number of molecular markers to cover the entire genome, the draft genome sequence must be established. This would serve as a reference to identify not only SNPs/SSRs, but also next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based markers, such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers.25Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) have developed powerful NGS techniques to sequence the genomes of all living organisms. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer generates a high number of short reads (<250 bp) with a high quality of base calls. In contrast, the PacBio RS II sequencer produces long reads (average read length, 7 kbp), though its throughput and quality of base calls are lower.26 Recently, long reads have been shown to fill gaps within and between scaffolds assembled by short reads.27 Prompted by the finding that different types of sequencers have been successfully combined for the de novo assembly of genome scaffolds of a heterozygous plant, Primula veris,28 we used two distinct types of sequencers to produce the draft genome sequence of the tetraploid species quinoa.In this study, we established an inbred and standard quinoa accession, Kd, suitable for molecular analyses, and provided the draft genome sequence of the quinoa accession using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB; http://quinoa.kazusa.or.jp), which provides annotations of in silico predicted genes. Furthermore, we utilized comparative genomics and experimental approaches to identify genes in quinoa that are involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsQuinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) seeds had been propagated in a temperature-controlled plant growth room at the Laboratory of Plant Pathology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University in the absence of the other quinoa accessions for over 20 years.29 Then at the Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), to establish an inbred quinoa accession, quinoa seeds have been propagated from a single plant derived from the seeds propagated in Kyoto University. To prevent cross-pollination, all of the inflorescences of these plants grown in JIRCAS were covered with non-woven pollination bags (Rizo, Tsukuba, Japan). The quinoa seeds were sown in a peat moss mix (Jiffy Mix, Sakata Seeds, Yokohama, Japan) in a cell tray and were grown in a growth chamber at 27 °C with a short-day photoperiod (11 h light/13 h darkness). After 14 days, the seedlings were transferred to a standard potting mix (Tsuchitaro, Sumitomo Forestry, Tokyo, Japan) in 20-L plant pots and were grown under ambient light in a temperature-controlled phytotron in JIRCAS with a temperature of 25 ± 5 °C and relative humidity of 55 ± 25%. For NGS analyses, a single plant was selected, and the progeny seeds were harvested.2.2. Evaluation of salt-tolerance in quinoa and ArabidopsisQuinoa seeds (Kd) were sown in the peat moss mix in a cell tray and were grown in a growth chamber at 27 °C with a short-day photoperiod (11 h light/13 h darkness). At 14 days after sowing, the seedlings were transferred to a standard potting mixture (Professional-baido, Daio Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) in 0.16-L plant pots and were further grown under the same conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana (CS60000) seeds were sown on MS agar plates and then were stored at 4 °C in the darkness for 3 days. Then, the seedlings were grown in a growth cabinet (Biotron; NK systems, Japan) at 22 °C with a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/8 h darkness). At 14 days after sowing, the seedlings were transferred to the standard potting mix in 0.16-L plant pots and were grown in a growth chamber at 27 °C with a short-day photoperiod (11 h light/13 h darkness). At 21 days after sowing, the quinoa and the Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 0 mM or 300 mM NaCl. The survival rates were measured at 22 days after the salt treatments. To maintain the concentration (300 mM NaCl corresponds to 2.90 S/m) and the default volume of the salt solution, the electrical conductivities of the salt solutions were measured using an electrical conductivity meter (Laqua DS-71: HORIBA, Kyoto, Japan) every 2 days.2.3. Inoculation of quinoa plantsFor virus inoculation, quinoa plants were grown in potting mix (Tsuchitaro, Sumitomo Forestry, Tokyo, Japan) in a plant growth room at 25 °C with 16 h of illumination per day. Capped full-length RNA transcripts of two bromoviruses, Brome mosaic virus (BMV) and Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan), as described previously.30,31 A mixture of transcripts of viral RNAs 1, 2, and 3 was inoculated mechanically with Carborundum onto the four youngest fully expanded leaves of 5-week-old quinoa plants. The inoculated plants were kept in the growth room and observed for symptom expression.2.4. Extraction and purification of nuclear DNAApproximately 80 g of quinoa leaves was harvested from 52-day-old single plants. Cell lysis and the isolation of nuclei were performed using CelLytic PN Isolation/Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications. Twenty grams of leaves were homogenized in liquid nitrogen, and then the tissue powder was suspended in 800 ml Nuclei Isolation Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Homogenization and suspension were repeated four times. The suspension was passed through a Filter Mesh 100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 1,300 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was resuspended in 15 ml of Wash Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by centrifugation at 2,200 g for 3 min at 4 °C. The wash step was repeated three times. The washed precipitate was resuspended in 10 ml of AP1 Buffer (Qiagen), 40 µl of RNase A solution (Qiagen) was added, and the solution was incubated at 65 °C for 18 min. After centrifugation at 21,500 g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a 50-ml tube. Then, 3.3 ml of Buffer P3 (Qiagen) was added to the tube, which was centrifuged at 21,500 g for 10 min at 4 °C. An equal volume of 2-propanol was added to the supernatant. After gentle mixing, the supernatant was centrifuged at 17,200 g for 3 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was rinsed twice with 70% ethanol. Finally, the resulting dried, pure nuclear DNA was dissolved in 10 ml of Buffer AE (Qiagen).2.5. DNA sequencingLibrary construction and sequencing were performed at Takara Bio. For sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform, a paired-end (PE) library with insert sizes of 185 bp and two mate-pair (MP) libraries with expected insert sizes of 2,700–3,500 bp and of 9,000–11,000 bp (Supplementary Table S1) were constructed from nuclear DNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Inc., CA, USA). These libraries were sequenced using a HiSeq 2500 sequencer. For sequencing by PacBio RS II platform, libraries with expected insert sizes (25,300–28,700 bp) (Supplementary Table S1) were constructed according to the manufacture’s protocol (Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced on 40 single-molecule real-time (SMRT) cells of PacBio RS II.2.6. Amplification and sequencing of RDR1 genomic fragmentsGenomic fragments of CqRDR1A and CqRDR1B from quinoa (Kd), and CpRDR1 of C. pallidicaule were amplified using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio). For amplification of CqRDR1B, two overlapping genomic fragments, named the 5'-half and 3'-half, were separately amplified. The amplified genomic fragments were purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Sequence data were obtained using the ABI PRISM 3130x1 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). To verify the segregation pattern of CqRDR1A and CqRDR1B genes in the F1 progeny of Kd, a co-dominant PCR marker, rdr1-MF2/MR2, was designed. Genomic DNA from 20 self-pollinated F1 progeny was used as PCR templates, and PCR products were analysed on a 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.7. Extraction of total RNA and DNase I treatmentFor RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis, total RNA was extracted from various quinoa organs (Supplementary Table S3), using a phenol-SDS method,32 with minor modifications. Quinoa organs were homogenized with liquid nitrogen, and the tissue powders were suspended in TE-saturated-phenol/RNA extraction buffer (0.2 M Tris, 0.2 M LiCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS) solution (1/1; vol/vol), mixed well, and centrifuged at 21,500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous layer was transferred to phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution followed, vortexed, and then centrifuged at 21,500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The total RNA in the upper aqueous phase was precipitated by adding 1/100 volume of acetic acid and an equal volume of 2-propanol. After incubation at -30 °C for 20 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 21,500 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in nuclease-free water and centrifuged to remove insoluble matter. A quarter volume of 10 M LiCl was added to the supernatant in tubes. The samples were vortexed and incubated at 4 °C for at least 1 h. After centrifuging at 21,500 g for 15 min at 4 °C, the precipitate was rinsed with 2 M LiCl solution and then dissolved in nuclease-free water. The total RNA solution was subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, and then the precipitates were rinsed with 70% ethanol. The dried total RNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water, and the quality was checked using a Bioanalyzer (model 2100; Agilent). Forty micrograms of total RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase I (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After DNase I treatment, the total RNA was purified using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1.0 µg total RNA using the PrimeScript High Fidelity RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio) with oligo-dT (20) primer, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.2.8. RNA sequencingLibrary preparation, sequencing, and assembly were performed at Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). The normalization library was prepared according to Shimizu et al.33 The normalized library was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with a 2× 150-bp read module. Low-quality reads and adapter sequences were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.32.342.9. Estimation of genome sizeFor genome size estimation, PE reads with a k-mer size of 17 were used, as reported previously.35 The k-mer distribution was investigated using Jellyfish 2.1.3.36 The genome size and coverage (i.e. the number of base pairs sequenced as a multiple of the number of base pairs present in the genome) were estimated using the peak at 97 on the k-mer frequency distribution curve (Supplementary Fig. S1) as described previously.352.10. Genome assemblyThe genome was assembled at Takara Bio. The adaptor sequences of Illumina reads were trimmed using cutadapt v1.2.1.37 The trimmed Illumina reads were assembled using ALLPATHS-LG v52488,38 with the setting HAPLOIDIFY= TRUE. PacBio reads of longer than 1,000 bp were used for gap-closing and further scaffolding of the assemblies obtained from the Illumina reads by PBJelly2 v14.1.14 under default settings.27 Sequences homologous to bacterial, fungal, and human (hg19) genome sequences, vector sequences from UniVec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/), chloroplast (Accession number: NC_000932.1) and mitochondrial (Accession number: NC_001284.2) genome sequences from A. thaliana, and the PhiX sequence used for background controlling in Illumina sequencing by BLASTN39 searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10 and length coverage of =10%, were excluded as probable contamination. Finally, scaffolds longer than 300 bp were selected and designated Cqu_r1.0. Repetitive sequences in Cqu_r1.0 were detected using RepeatScout 1.0.5.40 and RepeatMasker 4.0.3 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) as described previously.352.11. Gene prediction and annotationTo analyse the relationship between the transcriptome and the quinoa genome sequences, we mapped a de novo assembly of transcriptome sequences against Cqu_r1.0. De novo assembly was conducted using the software tools Velvet v1.2.10 and Oases v0.2.08.41,42 A multi-kmer approach was applied. In this approach, separate kmers are first assembled (kmers 59, 69, 79, 89) and then the set of assemblies is merged into a single ‘merged’ assembly (kmer 29). The assembled transcripts were clustered based on sequence identity (=99%) using the software CD-HIT-EST v4.6.43 These transcripts were mapped against the genome sequence (Cqu_r1.0) using GMAP v2016-05-01 software44 with the threshold option of =95% identity and =80% coverage.RNA-Seq reads were mapped onto the draft genome sequence (Cqu_r1.0) with TopHat 2.0.12.45 The bam file obtained was used to generate the training set for the gene prediction of BRAKER1 pipeline.46 Using the training set, the genes were predicted by Augustus 3.0.3.47 The RNA-Seq reads were mapped onto the predicted genes, and splicing variants were excluded by RSEM 1.2.15.48 The predicted genes in the quinoa genome together with those in S. oleracea (Spinach-1.0, 21,702 genes), B. vulgaris (RefBeet-1.1, 27,421 genes), Amaranthus hypochondriacus (AhG2s, 30,564 genes), and A. thaliana genomes (TAIR10, 35,386 genes) were clustered using the CD-HIT program43 with the parameters c = 0.4 and aL = 0.4.The predicted genes were subjected to similarity searches against the NCBI NR database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) and amino acid sequences of A. thaliana from TAIR10 (https://www.arabidopsis.org) using BLASTX with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10. The top hit was used to assign the product name. BLAST searches against UniProt (TrEMBL + Swiss-Prot) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-20 were also carried out. A domain search against InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) was conducted using InterProScan49 with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. Finally, genes were classified based on the NCBI euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) database50 by performing BLAST searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E-4. In addition, the genes were mapped onto the KEGG reference pathways by BLAST searches against the KEGG GENES database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-4, length of coverage of 25%, and identity of 50%.Genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were inferred based on a BLAST search against the NCBI NR database and conserved domains were identified based on a search against InterPro and GyDB 2.051 using hmmsearch in HMMER 3.052 with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. Transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) were predicted using tRNAscan-SE v.1.23.53 Ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) were predicted in BLASTN searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10 using A. thaliana 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (Accession number: X52320.1) and 18S rRNA (Accession number: X16077.1) as queries.2.12. Estimation of the pair-wise nucleotide divergence at synonymous site (Ks) between putative homoeologous genesCD-HIT was used to identify putative homoeologous genes. Using the amino acid data set containing 62,512 sequences annotated by BLASTP searches against the NCBI NR database, gene clusters containing two genes (i.e. putative homoeologous genes) were surveyed by the CD-HIT program with the parameters c = 0.9 and aS = 0.5. Paired genes on the same scaffold were not used for further analyses, as they might be tandemly duplicated genes. Alignments of two protein sequences were conducted by BLASTP, and subsequent codon alignment was conducted by PAL2NAL.54 Finally, Ks values were estimated by PAML55 and the frequency of Ks (0 < Ks < 0.5) was plotted.2.13. Phylogenetic analysesAlignments of sequences were carried out using CLUSTALW2.56 The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method,57 and the evolutionary distances were computed using the JTT matrix-based method.583. Results and discussion3.1. A standard quinoa accession Kd for molecular genetic analysesAlthough quinoa is essentially self-pollinating, this species does exhibit genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing.2,20 Quinoa is a gynomonoecious species that has both hermaphrodite and female flowers on the same plant, so that quinoa plants can accept pollen from the other individuals. Heterozygous alleles at a microsatellite locus were observed in 32% of quinoa accessions.20 Thus, reducing the genome complexity by repeated self-pollination is a crucial step for sequencing the genome of the allotetraploid species quinoa.A quinoa line has been propagated in an air-conditioned plant growth room without outcrossing for over 20 years.29 We multiplied seeds derived from this line with special non-woven pollination bags, in which inflorescences had been enclosed during flowering stage to prevent cross-pollination, producing inbred accession Kyoto-d (Kd) seeds. The inbred accession Kd (Fig. 1A–H) is more stable in terms of phenotypic uniformity, which has been evaluated based on the extent of variation in size, colour, and morphological characteristics of seeds, seedlings, and flowers in every generation obtained thus far, than any of the more than 150 accessions collected from research institutes (Fig. 1A; more detailed data will be published elsewhere), indicating that Kd is a suitable standard accession for molecular genetics and biology analyses. Kd seeds are approximately 2 mm in diameter (Fig. 1D). Like other quinoa lines (for example, Bonales-Alatorre et al.59), epidermal bladder cells (salt bladders) are present on the surface of leaves (Fig. 1E and F). Guard cells are also observed on both abaxial and adaxial surface of leaves (Fig. 1G and H). Figure 1Open in new tabDownload slideMorphological characteristics of quinoa (Kd) plants.

These data are consistent with previous findings for quinoa plants subjected to salt tolerance tests,11,59 suggesting that Kd is appropriate for molecular analyses to identify the mechanisms underlying enhanced tolerance of quinoa to abiotic stresses.

In contrast, a closely related and dicot-adapted bromovirus, CCMV, caused just small necrotic local lesions on the inoculated Kd leaves. Interestingly, CCMV was arrested within the lesions and did not spread systemically (Fig. 2E and F). These findings are in accordance with previous reports in the other accessions.63,64 Thus, Kd responds to abiotic and biotic stresses in a manner that is representative of quinoa species, and is therefore suitable for molecular analyses of its great adaptability and susceptibility to a wide range of viruses.3.2. Genome size estimationIn de novo genome assemblies, most scaffolds are in fragmented, and thus it is often difficult to determine the genome size accurately from the total assembly length. As the first step of our quinoa genome project, we estimated the genome size using the frequency distribution curve of 17-mer obtained from Illumina short reads, as successfully reported in previous studies.35,65 The k-mer frequency distribution curve (k-mer =17) using paired-ends (PEs) with a 185-bp insert size is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The highest peak, at a multiplicity of 97, was expected to be a ‘homo-peak’, that contained 17-mers from a homozygous region of the genome.66 Based on the highest peak, the genome size of quinoa was estimated to be 1.5 Gbp, in good agreement with that of 1,448 Mbp from a cytometry analysis.21 It is noteworthy that no peaks around half of the multiplicity of 97 were detected. A previous study indicated that a ‘hetero-peak’, i.e. a peak at half the multiplicity of the homo-peak, is detected in heterozygous species.66 A simulation also indicated that the greater the degree of heterozygosity, the greater the height of the hetero-peak.66 The finding that no distinct hetero-peaks were present in our k-mer analysis implies that the repeated self-pollination of Kd has resulted in a highly homogenized genetic background. The smaller peak at around the doubled multiplicity of the homo-peak (i.e. at around ~200) is of interest, because it may contain k-mers related to allotetraploidy. However, the k-mer curve distribution for the ‘diploid’ genome is known to show a smaller peak at the doubled multiplicity of the homo-peak.67 Thus, the smaller peak at around ~200 in our k-mer analysis may relate to genomic sequences caused by both allotetraploidy and other simple duplications.3.3. Genome assembly of quinoaWe obtained a large amount of quinoa DNA sequence data using Illumina HiSeq 2500 and PacBio RS II platforms (Supplementary Table S1). In total, 290.8 Gbp and 45.8 Gbp of raw data were generated by the HiSeq and PacBio RS II platforms, respectively. The average size of raw reads from PacBio RS II was 10.1 kbp. These Illumina and PacBio sequence data corresponded to 196× and 31× coverage of the quinoa genome, respectively. First, de novo genome assembly was performed using the short reads generated from the HiSeq platform using ALLPATHS-LG. We obtained 110,092 contigs, with a total length of 830.0 Mbp and an N50 size of 14,505 bp (Supplementary Table S4). These contigs were grouped into 36,423 scaffolds, with a total length of 946.6 Mbp and an N50 size of 53,276 bp. Then, using PacBio long reads and PBJelly2 software, gap-closing and further scaffolding of the assembly generated from HiSeq reads were performed. This strategy reduced the gap lengths in the scaffolds generated using short reads, improving the genome assembly.28 After processing with PBJelly2 software, we obtained 24,847 scaffolds, with a total length of 1.1 Gbp and an N50 length of 86,941 bp. The number of observed gaps (number of ‘N’ and ‘Others’) resulted in a 76% reduction of the number observed using only HiSeq data, and the N50 length was 1.6-fold greater than in the assembly before an application of PBJelly2 (Supplementary Table S4). After trimming of two scaffolds that exhibited signs of contamination (identified in a BLAST search), 24,845 scaffolds were designated as the draft genome sequence, Cqu_r1.0 (Table 1). The scaffolds were named ‘Cqu_sc’ followed by a five-digit identifier and the sequence version (e.g. Cqu_sc00001.1). The total length of Cqu_r1.0 was 1.1 Gbp, and the N50 length was 86,941 bp. As with the results of the genome assembly of the heterozygous plant P. veris,28 the length of the assembly for the tetraploid species quinoa was improved by including PacBio long reads. However, the genome coverage rates of the assembly were low both in quinoa (73%) and P. veris (63%). Recently, near-complete genome assembly of a diploid species, Vigna angularis (azuki bean), was achieved using 27.6 Gbp of the PacBio long reads, which corresponds to 51× coverage of the genome size.68 The authors constructed 2,529 scaffolds (N50 = 3.0 Mbp), covering 97.1% of the V. angularis genome. In our analysis of quinoa, we attained a genome coverage of 30×. Given the complexity of the quinoa genome resulting from ploidy and large genome size, a much greater coverage than 51× of the genome size is needed to use the method reported by Sakai et al.68 Attaining a greater genome coverage is our next objective for refining our quinoa assembly. Statistics of the draft genome sequences (Cqu_r1.0)Statistics of the draft genome sequences (Cqu_r1.0)3.4. Gene prediction and annotationTranscriptome sequencing of the normalized cDNA library, which was derived from 12 different tissues of quinoa, produced 14.5 million reads, corresponding to 4.3 Gbp after quality trimming (Supplementary Table S5). We obtained a de novo transcriptome assembly containing 87,877 transcripts (=100 bp). Of these transcripts, we were able to successfully map 71,744 (81.6%) onto Cqu_r1.0, which is higher than the mapping efficiency reported for barley69 (74.9%). Our genome assembly covers much of the transcriptome assembly, suggesting that it represents a suitable framework for gene prediction of C. quinoa. Using these RNA-Seq reads as the training set to predict genes for Augustus 3.0.3, 226,647 CDSs (Cqu_r1.0_cds) consisting of 190.5 Mbp, were obtained (Supplementary Table S6).Genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were inferred according to BLAST searches against the NCBI NR database (Supplementary Table S7). The total length of known repeats was 132.7 Mbp (12.2% of Cqu_r1.0) and Class I LTR elements were frequently found (7.2% of Cqu_r1.0). In this analysis, we identified unique repeats that had not previously been sequenced, and these had a total length of 535.5 Mbp and accounted for 49.2% of Cqu_r1.0. Genes annotated as transposons were tagged ‘TE’ in the sequence name.Based on BLAST searches against the NCBI NR database, the genes were divided into four classes. The first class contains genes that include both a start and stop codon; the second contains genes that include either a start codon or a stop codon, or that lack both a start and stop codon; the third contains genes that include a stop codon in the coding region; and the fourth contains short sequences (encoding < 50 amino acids). The tags based on this classification system and the numbers of genes in each tag are listed in Supplementary Table S8. We found that 150,029 genes in the first and second classes were not related to TEs, and we successfully annotated 62,512 of these 150,029 genes by BLAST searches against the UniProtKB database. Thus, the number of annotated genes (62,512 genes) is roughly twice that predicted in most other plant diploid genomes.70 This appears to be reasonable, since quinoa is a tetraploid species. However, given that a large number of genes (87,517 genes) were not annotated by the BLAST searches against the UniProtKB database, the number of protein-coding genes of quinoa predicted in this study might still be an underestimation. In addition to the protein-coding genes, we identified 2,592 genes for tRNAs, and the number of genes for each tRNA is summarized in Supplementary Table S9. The draft genome sequence (Cqu_r1.0), predicted gene sequences, deduced amino acid sequences, annotations derived from BLAST searches against the NCBI NR and TAIR10 databases, and domains identified in the search against InterPro were included in the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB; http://quinoa.kazusa.or.jp). In addition, local BLAST searches and keyword searches for gene names and their annotations were also implemented in the QGDB.An amino acid sequence similarity search was performed for the predicted proteins encoded by the subset of 62,512 genes using the CD-HIT program with the parameters c = 0.9 and aS = 0.5, and 46,695 of sequence homology clusters were identified. Of these, 9,768 contained two genes; i.e. 19,536 of 62,512 predicted genes were paired. Of the 9,768 pairs, 131 were located on the same scaffold, and might be tandemly duplicated genes. The average of Ks in the remaining 9,637 clusters was 0.08, and the distribution of Ks values peaked at ~0.035 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Considering that the Ks values of these duplicated genes are similar to the previously estimated Ks average between two homoeologous SOS1 genes (Ks = 0.077),71 most of these duplicated genes in a single cluster can be considered as putative homoeologs derived from two genomes. A major challenge in the de novo assembly of polyploids is to differentiate the homoeologous genomes and to assign the genes/scaffolds to each subgenome. In hexaploid wheat, transcriptome assemblies in ancestral diploid species were used to classify the genes predicted from a de novo genome assembly into the A, B, and D genomes.72 This was not possible in quinoa because the donor diploid species of the B-genome has yet to be identified,23 and no genome or transcriptome data of the A-genome species were available. Nevertheless, the fact that we could identify several putative homeologous genes suggests that we were successful in capturing the two subgenomes at least to a certain extent. Genome or transcriptome sequencing of C. standleyanum or other A-genome species, such as C. pallidicaule, will facilitate efforts to assign the predicted genes/scaffolds to the A- or B-genome in quinoa.3.5. Comparative analysis of the quinoa and other Amaranthaceae species gene sequencesThe entire data set of 226,647 genes was mapped onto the KEGG metabolic pathway and classified into the categories under ‘1. Metabolism’ and the numbers of mapped genes in each pathway are summarized in Supplementary Table S10. Briefly, 1,703 genes from quinoa were mapped onto 133 of the 158 categories of metabolic pathway in the KEGG database, whereas 1,748 genes of S. oleracea, 1,753 genes of B. vulgaris, and 1,009 genes of A. hypochondriacus were mapped onto 133, 135, and 124 pathways, respectively. Twenty-six pathways were only associated with genes in the quinoa genome. However, genes with similarity to the quinoa genes on these 26 pathways were identified in S. oleracea, B. vulgaris, or A. hypochondriacus by subsequent BLASTP searches against the NR database (Supplementary Table S11). These would be false positive by the mapping analyses for KEGG metabolic pathways under the parameters with relatively low thresholds (E-value cut-off of 1E-4, length of coverage of 25%, and identity of 50%).The entire data set of 226,647 genes was also annotated by conducting similarity searches using the CD-HIT program (-c:0.4, -aL:0.4; Fig. 3). First, the predicted genes in the quinoa genome were clustered together with 30,564 genes in A. hypochondriacus, 27,421 in B. vulgaris, 21,702 in S. oleracea, and 35,386 in A. thaliana. The 3,393 clusters were common among five species, and 9,534, 4,543, 6,114, 5,805, and 9,996 genes belonged to the common clusters in C. quinoa, A. hypochondriacus, B. vulgaris, S. oleracea, and A. thaliana, respectively. Quinoa has 565 clusters of genes in a section shared only with A. thaliana, which is much less than the 1,224 genes present in sections shared with S. oleracea, 1,498 with B. vulgaris, and 3,215 with A. hypochondriacus in Amaranthaceae (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained in the comparative analysis of the filtered dataset of 62,512 genes of quinoa annotated by performing BLASTP searches against the NR database in NCBI (Supplementary Fig. S3). In the Amaranthaceae family, the genera Chenopodium and Spinacia belong to Chenopoideae, the genus Beta to Betoideae, and the genus Amaranthus to Amaranthoideae.73 The genes, which were selected from a common section (central part in Fig. 3) on condition of a single copy being present in A. hypochondriacus, B. vulgaris, S. oleracea, and A. thaliana and of two copies being present in quinoa, were concatenated. Multiple alignment was carried out for the concatenated genes by ClustalW2,56 and the dendrogram was constructed by the neighbour-joining method (Supplementary Fig. S4). Quinoa and S. oleracea were phylogenetically closely related as expected, confirming that genes obtained from the QGDB were appropriate derivatives of those in the three other Amaranthaceae species. These basically single copy genes might be useful in phylogenetic analyses of core eudicots, as previously proposed for orthologous gene sets in P. veris.28Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideCluster analysis of the predicted gene sequences.

Ten lysine histidine transporter 2 (LHT2) like genes, which are related to amino acid uptake, were detected in the quinoa genome,74,75 but 2, 3, and 1 genes were found in S. oleracea, B. vulgaris, and A. hypochondriacus, respectively (Supplementary Table S12). Some cytochrome P450 genes were also expanded in the quinoa genome. Two of these were annotated as cytochrome P450 71A1 and 76AD1, which play a role in the polyphenol- and betalain-biosynthesis pathway, respectively.76,77 Expansion and subsequent functional differentiation of these genes might be related to quinoa having a high protein content and abundant secondary metabolites.3.6. Genome designed for adaptation to hostile environmentsQuinoa can withstand a variety of abiotic stresses,61,78 including high salinity (Fig. 2A–D). Transporter genes implicated in salt tolerance in quinoa, such as CqSOS1A and CqSOS1B, which are homologs of Arabidopsis SOS1 involved in plasma membrane-localized Na+/H+ transport, have been analysed so far.71 Meanwhile, the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to regulate abiotic stress tolerance.79 Phylogenetic analyses revealed that gene families involved in ABA signalling were substantially expanded in the quinoa genome compared with other Amaranthaceae plant species. For example, the PYR/PYL/RCAR gene family, which encodes a bona fide ABA receptor, plays key roles in ABA signalling. Neighbour-joining analyses of AtPYLs and PYLs from Amaranthaceae species revealed three phylogenetic groups (Supplementary Fig. S5). In each group, we identified subgroups consisting of genes of Amaranthaceae species, including three in group I, two in group II, and three in group III (Supplementary Fig. S5). Six of these subgroups contained two phylogenetically similar genes from C. quinoa and one from each of the other Amaranthaceae species included in the analysis. These pairs of C. quinoa genes are putative homoeologs, thought to have arisen from allotetraploidization. The gene family encoding SnRK2 protein kinases includes core positive regulators of ABA signalling, and similar phylogenetic results were obtained: four of the six subgroups identified contained two genes from C. quinoa and one from each of the other Amaranthaceae species examined (Supplementary Fig. S6). The Ks values between putative homoeologs found in PYLs and SnRK2 ranged from 0 to 0.088 and from 0 to 0.076, respectively (Supplementary Table S13). These findings are roughly consistent with the distribution of Ks values estimated from putative homoeologous gene sets obtained by CD-HIT analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, our sequence results provide an important basis for studies aimed at determining the roles and precise numbers of candidate genes and pathways that regulate tolerance to abiotic stress in allotetraploid quinoa.Quinoa and N. benthamiana have been widely used as diagnostic hosts to identify virus species based on their own characteristic symptoms.62 However, N. benthamiana is usually systemically infected with viruses, whereas quinoa is either locally or systemically infected, as shown in Figure 2E and F. Although mutations in Rdr1, which is involved in antiviral defence, have provided intriguing clues as to the mechanism by which a wide range of viruses can amplify well in N. benthamiana,80,81 it remains unknown why a broad range of viruses can infect quinoa. We therefore analysed the RDR1 genes in quinoa.We identified two RDR1 orthologs in quinoa derived from a predicted gene (Cqu_c21957.1_g001.1) based on QGDB and a truncated gene on a scaffold (Cqu_c12210.1), and named these CqRDR1A and CqRDR1B, respectively. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing revealed that CqRDR1A carries a complete ORF encoding 1,122 amino acids, and that CqRDR1B harbours a 2-bp deletion in the protein-coding region that induces a nonsense mutation (Supplementary Fig. S7), leading to the absence of a large portion of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domain that includes the active site (DxDGD).82 Along with the observation that the RdRP domains are well conserved in angiosperms (Fig. 4), these findings clearly indicate that RdRP function is impaired in CqRDR1B.

Based on a co-dominant marker that distinguishes between two CqRDR1 genes, we confirmed that all 20 tested Kd progeny retained both genes at different loci (Supplementary Fig. S8). Comparison of RDR1 sequences between quinoa and C. pallidicaule indicated that CqRDR1A was derived from the Chenopodium A-genome (Supplementary Fig. S9). In addition, no PCR products were amplified from four C. pallidicaule lines using a B-genome-specific primer pair (data not shown), suggesting that CqRDR1A and CqRDR1B are homoeologs. Although further analyses will be required to reveal the mechanism supporting the susceptibility to a wide variety of viruses, these findings provide insight into the mechanism underlying the response to virus infections in quinoa.4. Conclusion and future perspectivesThe year 2013 was declared the International Year of Quinoa by FAO to heighten public awareness of the nutritional benefits of this durable plant, as part of a sustainable food production effort aimed at food security and nutrition.17 However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity and its genome complexity, due to allotetraploidy. To overcome the former limitation, we established the inbred accession Kd that possesses standard quinoa properties in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. This provides a useful experimental standard material for basic and applied studies of quinoa, which have recently focused on its exceptional nutritional value, tolerance to unfavourable environments, and susceptibility to a broad range of viruses.The allotetraploid nature of quinoa makes it difficult to construct a genome assembly using high-throughput sequencing. To overcome this limitation, we employed a combination of Illumina HiSeq 2500 and PacBio RS II NGSs, which produce short (approximately 200 bp) and long (mean length of 10 kbp) reads, respectively. The long reads were used for gap-closing and for further scaffolding of the assembly obtained from the Illumina short reads to improve the genome assembly, and resulted in a 76% reduction in gaps and a 1.6-fold increase in the N50 length. In our trial usage of the database QGDB, ABA signalling genes and RDR1 were detected, and gene expansion probably caused by tetraploidization was observed in all cases. It should be noted that we were also able to identify putative homoeologous genes in both the clustering and Ks distribution analyses. Thus, although our assembly does not cover the entire genome and still contains large gaps, these findings have clearly demonstrated that the genome database created from the assembly is a useful basis for identifying agronomically important genes. Nevertheless, the length of scaffolds of our assembly could be increased by applying new technologies, such as high-throughput optical mapping,83 which provides long-range genomic information through constructing restriction maps. In addition, a high-density linkage map generated using NGS-based GBS markers with Kd-based recombinant inbred lines (RILs) will also be required to anchor the improved scaffolds to each chromosome to generate pseudomolecules of the 18 chromosomes in quinoa.5.

IntroductionThe last decade has seen an extensive development of ultrasensitive technologies capable of detecting DNA variants present at very low frequencies (~10-4–10-5) in a sample driven mainly by cancer research to better understand tumour development. Additionally, evolutionary biologists and geneticists have invested considerable efforts in measuring mutation frequencies to gain further insights into the process of mutagenesis. Directly measuring rare mutations or sequence variants in a large DNA pool is still quite difficult given the vast excess of background, which has been reduced with special tweaks relying on restriction enzyme digests to reduce the wild-type pool1,2 or the highly selective enzymatic activity of pyrophosphorolysis coupled with polymerization of blocked primers, known as pyrophosphorolysis-activated PCR.3,4Alternative methods to measure ultra-rare sequence variations have been developed using single-molecule amplification approaches that amplify each DNA molecule in its own compartment, which allows to count each mutation since clonal copies of the initial single DNA molecule are produced.5–7 The amplification of single DNA molecules, often referred as dilution PCR, single-molecule PCR (smPCR), or digital PCR (dPCR), has been considerably improved in its throughput by in-house platforms8 for rare mutation detection5,9–13 or DNA methylation analysis,14 but also by commercial platforms available either as chip-based systems (using nanofluidic chips), or droplet-based systems (e.g. droplet digital PCR).15 In fact, over the last years, we have seen an explosion of applications using the nanoliter-sized droplet PCR for the highly precise absolute quantification of nucleic acids, especially for DNA methylation analysis,16 and the highly sensitive detection of cancer mutations17 or fetal DNA.18 and references withinNext-generation sequencing (NGS) can produce billions of reads per sequencing run, and also provides an ideal platform with the appropriate throughput to identify ultra-rare sequence variations. However, a fundamental limitation of this technology has been the high error rates associated with library preparation (involving also PCR), sequencing, and base calling, resulting in error rates of ~1–0.05% with common sequencing instruments like Illumina (reviewed by Kinde et al.19). As a result, different approaches for library preparation have been published to distinguish sequencing or PCR errors from real DNA variants, decreasing error rates to less than 10-5 per base sequenced (depending on the method).19–24 This is achieved by tagging strategies that allow the formation of consensus sequences (also known as read families), each family representing one initial DNA molecule. A true mutation is present in the majority of the reads in a family; whereas PCR and sequencing errors are only present in a subset of reads within a family. Strategies to accomplish this individual tagging include the addition of a random sequence in the amplification primers,19,23 ligation of tag-containing adapters,22 or the hybridization of molecular inversion probes (MIPs),20,24 which contain random tags, followed by extension and ligation, forming a single-stranded circle. Alternatively, in circle sequencing, family members are created by circularization of small DNA fragments followed by rolling circle amplification.21 This rolling circle amplification has the advantage over other conventional PCR methods that it filters out errors introduced in early PCR cycles that are exponentially amplified resulting in artifactual mutations (known as ‘jackpot mutations’).While all these described consensus sequence-based ultrasensitive technologies report extremely low error rates by filtering out PCR and sequencing-associated errors, amplifiable DNA lesions (such as 8-oxoguanine, or deaminated cytosine or 5-methylcytosine) opposite of which the polymerase can insert a wrong base,25 and references within cannot be distinguished with most of these technologies, and therefore, have a profound effect in the sensitivity and the detection limits of the methods. So far, ‘duplex sequencing’ has been shown to be a suitable ultrasensitive NGS method that can filter out amplifiable lesions, in addition to PCR and sequencing errors, by a special tagging strategy.22 Duplex sequencing independently tags each strand of a double-stranded DNA, such that the resulting forward and reverse consensus reads can be traced back to the same initial double-stranded DNA molecule. By comparing the forward and reverse strand of a single initial double-stranded DNA molecule, errors coming from DNA lesions, present in only one strand, can be identified and corrected. However, even duplex sequencing has its limitations due to the high number of reads necessary to obtain the final consensus sequence of one initial DNA molecule. While smaller genomes/targets are affordable, sequencing the whole human genome is very costly and not feasible yet. Additionally, a high amount of starting material is required, which makes the method unsuitable for the analysis of limited material, e.g. in forensics or specific clinical samples.Other sequencing-based methods developed over the last years allow direct sequencing of different lesion types, either by the analysis of alterations in the kinetics of DNA polymerases with single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing,26 or by the introduction and sequencing of an additional unnatural base pair at the lesion sites that can be directly sequenced with the a-hemolysin nanopore system.27 However, considering the high error rates of both these methods and the technical challenge when measuring higher lesion numbers, to date they provide a tool for the direct study of several DNA lesions, but are not well suited for the analysis of ultra-rare sequence variants.Amplifiable template lesions occur frequently during DNA extraction and preparation protocols in which increased oxidation and hydrolytic deamination rates have been associated.28–35 For example, Costello et al.30 reported an increase of G->T transversions that were directly linked to DNA preparation protocols that induced 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, a common product of oxidative DNA damage. This lesion does not only occur during sample preparation, but was also shown to be present in genomic DNA at levels of 10-6, with increased numbers at meiotic recombination sites and regions with a high SNP density.36 The oxidized guanine (8-oxoG) pairs either with cytosine, or more frequently, with adenine during amplification.37,38 Another common form of DNA damage is the deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine (5-meC). The deamination product of cytosine is uracil, which can be easily removed by treating the DNA with a uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), followed by the cleavage of the abasic site by an AP endonuclease resulting in an unamplifiable template.39 However, the deamination of 5-meC forms thymine, a base naturally occurring in DNA, which cannot be easily removed, and is, therefore, a common source of artifacts.This highlights that DNA lesions arising during template preparation are a critical problem, especially for applications requiring ultrasensitive detection, since they often result in false positive mutation calls. Yet, very little is known on how different lesions are amplified and what kind of biases result. In theory, a lesion on one DNA strand would only render about half to a quarter of the PCR or sequencing products with the wrong base. However, this might not be the case and lesions could be an important driver of ‘jackpot’ or artifactual mutations due to amplification biases happening during PCR. More importantly, only very few studies report on sample preparation procedures that can reduce sequencing artifacts, and improve the sensitivity and detection limits of ultrasensitive methods. For this reason, we evaluated in this work the artifact formation of the most common amplifiable DNA lesions (uracil, 8-oxoG, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, and DNA heteroduplexes) with two different PCR-based approaches used in ultrasensitive technologies, smPCR and duplex sequencing. Specifically, we analyzed synthetically produced inserts with DNA lesions at defined positions. Additionally, we also analyzed artifact formation in plasmids and genomic DNA and also tested different sample preparation procedures to reduce specific DNA lesions. Finally, we characterized the efficiency of different DNA repair enzymes in eliminating specific lesions before PCR.2. Materials and methods2.1. DNA sourcesPlasmid and human genomic DNA: A plasmid (HSI_vector) containing a 4187-bp region of the human chromosome 21 was prepared as described in Supplementary methods. Human sperm and blood samples from anonymous donors were collected by informed consent approved by the ethics commission of Upper Austria (Approval: F1-11) at the IVF Landes-Frauen- und Kinderklinik Linz, Austria. Blood DNA was extracted using the PAXgene blood DNA kit (Qiagen), sperm DNA was extracted with the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit, as described previously.40,41 In short, we extracted sperm DNA following instructions of the manufacturer except for the proteinase K digest which was performed overnight at 37 °C. The plasmid (HSI_vector: Supplementary Fig. S1) was extracted with a standard plasmid extraction protocol detailed in Supplementary Methods.Synthetic DNA inserts: We produced six different double-stranded inserts with known DNA lesions by hybridizing synthetic single-stranded DNA fragments (Supplementary Table S1) in different combinations (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S2). The sequence of the synthetic DNA was designed to produce 20 bp single-stranded overhangs at the 3' ends after hybridization to allow the integration of the synthetic fragment in the HSI_vector. Two bases at positions 2540-2541 of the vector were designed to be different from the original HSI_vector sequence. The hybridization was carried out by mixing equal amounts (2–10 µl) of 100 µM of two different single-stranded synthetic DNAs in hybridization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl) and incubating them with the following temperature program: 98 °C for 3 min, with a temperature decrease of 1 °C per min, and storage at 8 °C; the hybridization efficiency was monitored on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. All inserts were synthesized as Ultramers (which provide a lower synthesis error rate compared with standard oligos,42 and for which, the synthesis chemistry provides an improved coupling efficiency above 99.5%), except for the strand with 8-oxoG, which was only available as standard DNA Oligo (both from Integrated DNA Technologies).

Duplex sequencing was performed directly on the inserts 2, 3, 5, and 6.Vector-insert (HSI_insert) DNA constructs: Within the HSI_vector, we substituted a 110 bp fragment with the different synthetic inserts (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The steps involved in the preparation of the vector-insert constructs were modified from the Gibson assembly43 since standard cloning by restriction digests and ligation was too inefficient to exchange the majority of the old inserts by a synthetic one. An overall scheme of the preparation of the HSI_insert constructs is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. The HSI_vector was first linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme XmaI (NEB) to allow better amplification, and 108 molecules (which is the minimal amount of DNA that was amplified successfully) were then amplified with primers (vector linearization) designed such that the PCR product did not contain position 2465-2574 of HSI_vector (site of the synthetic insert) (Supplementary Table S1). Reactions contained 108 molecules HSI_vector, 0.33 ng Escherichia coli DNA, 0.5 µM of each primer, 0.1× SYBR Green I (Invitrogen), 1× Expand Long Range Buffer with MgCl2, and 0.35 U Expand Long Range Enzyme Mix (Roche). The reactions were carried out with an initial heating step of 92 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 92 °C for 10 s, 61 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 8 min. The amplified vector was then purified by using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, followed by resection of ~4 µg vector DNA in 3'–5' direction with 0.29 U/µl T5 Exonuclease in a 35 µl reaction at 37 °C for 15 min. The product was then purified again with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up Kit.After hybridization of the inserts, they were phosphorylated at the 5' end with a T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) (NEB) as follows: 6.02 × 1013 molecules insert were treated with 10 U PNK and 1× T4 Ligase Buffer (containing ATP) in a 10 µl reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The six different inserts were then hybridized to the HSI_vector in separate reactions and extended with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following protocol: 0.185 mM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1× PCR Buffer, 5.36 × 1010 molecules of the vector, and 6.02 × 1011 molecules of each insert, respectively, were mixed in a 12 µl reaction and incubated at 55 °C for 15 min for hybridization, followed by an extension step with 0.6 U Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (activated by incubation at 94 °C for 5 min before addition) at 50 °C for 15 min. After this extension, 2 µl of the reaction were mixed with 20 U Taq DNA Ligase (NEB) and 1× Taq DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer in a 10 µl reaction and incubated at 55 °C for 15 min. The HSI_insert constructs containing different fragments were then digested with XhoI (linearization of the vector for better downstream amplification efficiencies) and DpnI (to remove the original vectors without the synthetic inserts) (both restriction enzymes from NEB).2.2. Template treatments with DNA repair enzymesWe tested Fpg (formamidopyrimidine [fapy]-DNA glycosylase or 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase) and the USER (Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent) enzyme system to reduce the amplification of different DNA lesions. Treatment with Fpg was performed as follows: 5 × 107 copies linearized HSI_vector or 5 × 107 copies linearized HSI_insert_5 construct were treated with 4 U Fpg (NEB) in 1× NEBuffer 1 and 1× BSA in a reaction volume of 50 µl at 37 °C for 1 h. Control reactions were set up without Fpg.Treatments with the USER enzyme were performed on HSI_insert_1 by incubating 2 × 107 copies HSI_insert construct with 1 U USER enzyme (NEB) in 1× Phusion HF Buffer in a reaction volume of 20 µl at 37 °C for 30 min prior to amplification.For duplex sequencing, 10 µl purified, adapter ligated library of insert 3 were incubated with 1 U USER enzyme in 1× NEB CS Buffer in a reaction volume of 20 µl at 37 °C for 1h. As a control, another 10 µl were incubated for the same time without addition of the enzyme. The reactions were then purified with 1.2 volumes Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckmann Coulter), eluted in 20 µl TElow.2.3. Single-molecule PCRFor single-molecule PCR (smPCR) of HSI_insert constructs, PCR was performed with the ‘SMA Inserts’ primers (Supplementary Table S1) in 20 µL reactions containing vector-insert construct DNA (diluted to 0.2 molecules per reaction that rendered on average ~20% smPCR reactions with an amplification product), 0.33 ng E. coli DNA, 0.25 µM of the appropriate forward and reverse primer, 0.16 mM dNTPs, 0.5× EvaGreen (Jena Bioscience), 1× Phusion HF Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 0.1 U Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase. The reactions were carried out with an initial heating step of 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 55 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s.Given that none of the steps during the HSI_insert construction were 100% efficient, we used several control passes to ensure that we are analyzing the HSI_insert construct: (1) we placed our primers such that only an insert ligated within the vector was amplified during smPCR, and (2) amplifiable vectors without the synthetic insert (present at ~10% as circular vectors with the original sequence) were distinguished by a dinucleotide unique to the insert identified by genotyping before sequencing (Supplementary Methods).In selected experiments, Phusion U Hot Start DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for the amplification in otherwise identical reactions in order to test amplification efficiencies in uracil containing templates.For smPCR of human genomic molecules and the HSI_vector DNA, the same PCR conditions were used as described previously for HSI.41 For the amplification of the HSI_vector, equal primers and PCR conditions were used as for the genomic DNA, with only minor differences in the reaction composition: in short, the HSI_vector DNA was diluted to 0.2 molecules on average per reaction to reduce the number of reactions with more than one molecule to less than 2%, based on the Poisson distribution. As carrier DNA, 0.33 ng E. coli or blood DNA per reaction was used when amplifying the HSI_vector. All smPCR reactions were set up in laminar flow hoods to avoid carry-over contamination and no-template controls (NTCs) were included in all experiments.The smPCR amplicons were either analyzed by sequencing or genotyping (Supplementary Methods). Sequencing was performed by standard capillary Sanger sequencing in a 96-well format (by LGC Genomics GmbH), as described previously.41 For the HSI_insert constructs, only the sequencing primer HSInt15-Reg3-fwd was used.41 In some cases, the fidelity of de novo mutations was confirmed by sequencing in reverse direction with the sequencing primer HSInt15-Reg3-2rev. Chromatograms were analyzed with the Mutation Surveyor software44 for new mutations, and outcomes of mismatches and DNA lesions (uracils, 8-oxoG and 5-meC) as described before.412.4. Temperature treatments of DNAIn order to study the effect of temperature on lesion formation, we performed different heating steps (as often used in DNA extraction protocols) or freeze and thaw cycles on HSI_insert_6 or insert 6 and analyzed them with smPCR or duplex sequencing, respectively. For each analysis (smPCR or duplex sequencing), we compared three general treatments: an untreated control, a frozen, and a heated sample. smPCR: A freshly prepared HSI_insert_6 construct (control) was frozen at -20 °C for 24 h (frozen sample). We also used a standard DNA extraction protocol (Gentra Puregene Cell Kit) as used previously for sperm DNA extraction40,41 on 5 × 107 molecules unfrozen, freshly prepared HSI_insert_6, but we included a heating step by performing the proteinase K digest at 65 °C for 2 h and the samples/solutions were mixed by vortexing (heated sample).Duplex sequencing: Prior to the library preparation of insert 6, an aliquot was left untreated (control), a second one was thawed, frozen again at -20 °C for 14 days, and thawed and refrozen two additional times for 24 h freezing steps (frozen sample). The third aliquot was equivalent to the control, but then heated to 65 °C for 3 h in TElow during library preparation after the adapter ligation step to avoid sample denaturation beforehand (heated sample).2.5. Duplex sequencing of insertsWe evaluated artifact formation at lesions by the independent analysis of the forward and reverse strands using single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs), which have a ~100-fold reduced error rate compared with conventional NGS methods.22 Duplex libraries were prepared as described by Kennedy et al.,45 with minor modifications. An aliquot of 3,630 ng double-stranded synthetic DNA inserts (inserts 2, 3, 5, and 6) containing different DNA lesions were end-repaired with the NEBNext End Repair Module (NEB) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, except that the incubation time was elongated to 1 h (1.5 h for insert 5) instead of the suggested 30 min. This adaptation was necessary to blunt the 20 bp 3'-overhangs of the fragments (one 50 bp overhang in insert 5). Libraries were then A-tailed, and the adapter was ligated with 1800 U T4 ligase (NEB) with 20× molar excess at 16 °C for 30 min.Duplex adapters were prepared as described by Kennedy et al.,45 with some minor modifications in the protocol. In brief: T-tailed adapters were prepared by hybridization of the oligos MWS51 and MWS55 (sequences reported by Kennedy et al.45), followed by extension with the Klenow Fragment (3'<U+2192>5' exo-) (NEB) and a restriction digest with TaaI (HypCH4III) at 60 °C for 16 h. Adapters were purified by ethanol precipitation with 2 volumes absolute ethanol and 0.5 volumes 5 M NH4OAc. The different steps of adapter preparation were monitored on a 3% agarose gel (1.5% normal agarose and 1.5% low-melt agarose). One attomole of adapter-ligated DNA was used for the generation of amplified tag families, and the optimal cycle number for amplification was evaluated by real-time PCR, as suggested by Kennedy et al.45 Purifications of DNA between the different steps of library preparation were performed with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckmann Coulter), or ethanol precipitation for the shorter (80 bp) insert 5 (as described for the adapters).The libraries were quantified with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform producing 151 bp paired-end reads (v2 chemistry). Reported results represent one sequencing run; however, the analysis of a second independent sequencing run of the same libraries showed very similar results (Supplementary Fig. S4). Duplex sequencing data were analyzed according to the pipeline published by Kennedy et al.45 with several modifications as described below.To obtain independent sequencing data for the forward and reverse strands, single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) were analyzed instead of duplex consensus sequences (DCSs). The 151 base paired-end reads were trimmed to 126 bases (96 bases for insert 5) with the FASTX-Toolkit before analysis. This trimming was necessary since the inserts had only a length of 110 bp (80 bp for insert 5), to which the duplex adapters were ligated. After trimming, the SSCS bam-files were created with published duplex sequencing analysis protocols.45 An insert-specific reference containing mixed bases at sites differing between forward and reverse strands was used to avoid biases in the preferential strand-specific mapping (as demonstrated for insert 2; Supplementary Table S2). Since the used read-length produced paired-end reads overlapping the whole insert sequence (80 bp for insert 5 and 110 bp for all other inserts), it was possible to merge the SSCSs of both paired-ends during sequence analysis. This allowed to recover sequence information at positions with high error rates (represented with N in one of the paired SSCS reads, when the predominant base was present in less than 70% of the family members) by substituting the N with the correct base derived from the opposite paired-end SSCS read. For this purpose, the reads in the SSCS bam-file were first separated into read 1 and read 2 and further divided into forward- and reverse-mapping reads, allowing the separate analysis of the forward and reverse strands of the initial DNA molecule, using samtools.46,47 Only the reads with both paired-end reads available were used for further analysis. The bam-files were first converted to fastq format using bamtools,48 and only reads with both paired-ends were merged using PEAR.49 After merging, the forward and reverse mapping reads were again separately mapped to the sample-specific reference sequence using BWA50 for the further independent analysis of forward and reverse strands. Alignments were inspected with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).51 The first and the last 15 bases of the inserts (which could represent initially 3' resected ends that were repaired to blunt ends) were not used for analysis since errors in end-repair is a potential source of sequence biases.2.6. Statistical analysisError bars for mutations frequencies were calculated as 95% Poisson confidence intervals (CIs),52,53 the significance of differences between obtained mutations rates was tested with Fisher’s Exact Test.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction and analysis of inserts with different template lesionsIn this work, we evaluated how template lesions can introduce different biases or artifactual mutations with considerable impact on the detection limits in applications measuring extremely rare events. We used two different ultrasensitive methods for this purpose: smPCR and a special application of NGS, known as duplex sequencing.22 In smPCR, we analyzed amplification products of single molecules by Sanger sequencing. In duplex sequencing, each strand of a DNA duplex is tagged and sequenced by NGS, such that the original complementary DNA can be reconstructed.22 In this work, we only used the forward and reverse single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) of the duplex sequences, which was sufficient for filtering out PCR and sequencing errors. Both ultrasensitive methods provide their own advantages: in smPCR, strand-specific amplification biases can be identified via the assessment of one initial molecule at a time; whereas, a higher number of molecules can be inspected with duplex sequencing compared with smPCR.We tested the effect of lesions on three different template types: a vector with synthetic inserts (HSI_insert) or just the synthetic DNA inserts with known lesions, an oxidized plasmid (the exact location of lesion sites was not predefined), and human genomic DNA (template source in a high variety of biological applications). We produced six different inserts with various DNA lesions or heteroduplexes at predefined positions, representing the most common amplifiable lesions arising within cells and during DNA template preparation (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S2). The ~100-bp double-stranded synthetic fragments were ligated either into a plasmid (HSI_insert) for smPCR, or were directly analyzed with duplex sequencing (Fig. 1B). For smPCR, the observed substitution frequency of the HSI_insert (~800 nucleotides that included the ~100 bp insert) was not significantly different between insert and plasmid DNA (3.7 × 10-4 versus 5.9 × 10-4 substitutions/bp, respectively; P value = 0.11, Fisher’s exact test). In comparison, error rates measured by smPCR in human genomic DNA or plasmid DNA directly prepared from bacterial extracts (HSI_ vector) rendered mutation frequencies of the order of ~10-6 and ~10-4, respectively. However, inserts showed a higher frequency of insertions and deletions (1.5 × 10-3 versus 3.8 × 10-5 indels/bp, respectively; P value = 4.4 × 10 -8, Fisher’s exact test). Comparable frequencies of synthesis errors in ultramers were also found previously42 and could be confirmed with duplex sequencing (calculated for the insert 6 control sample) to be 3.9 × 10-4 substitutions/bp and 1.1 × 10-3 indels/bp. These low synthesis errors did not interfere with our measurements of artifact formation from lesions in the inserts.3.2. Guanine oxidation is an important source of artifactual mutationsThe modified base 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, more commonly referred as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), is the oxidation product of guanine and one of the most frequently occurring form of DNA damage. Since 8-oxoG tends to pair with adenine instead of cytosine,37,38 this often leads to sequencing artifacts (G->T or C->A transversions, depending on the strand used as a reference). In this work, we analyzed templates with an 8-oxoG in one strand and a deletion in the complementary strand at the same position (HSI_insert_5 or insert 5; Fig. 1A), which allowed the identification of the amplified strand and to the understanding of how 8-oxoG leads to artifactual mutations.By screening 56 smPCR reactions with single molecules of HSI_insert_5, we observed that 8-oxoG lesions are amplified with the same efficiency as strands without lesions (35 and 31, respectively). This could also be confirmed with duplex sequencing, resulting in similar numbers of forward- and reverse-mapping reads (57,092 and 56,899, respectively). A closer look at the substitution types resulting at 8-oxoG lesions in smPCR showed that the polymerase added an adenine opposite the 8-oxoG in 42.9% of all reactions, resulting in a G->T homogenous chromatogram peak in 25% of all reactions (these amplified only the forward 8-oxoG containing strand) or a or a G/del->T/del (17.9%) heterogeneous chromatogram in the reactions that amplified both the forward and the reverse strand. The polymerase also inserted in rare occasions (1.8%) a guanine opposite the 8-oxoG resulting in a G->C transversion, and only in 5.4% of all reactions the polymerase incorporated a cytosine opposite the 8-oxoG and no nucleotide change was observed (Table 1). When considering reactions in which only the forward strand (with the 8-oxoG lesion) was amplified, substitution frequencies of 56% and 4% of the total number of amplified 8-oxoGs for the G->T and G->C transversion were observed, respectively (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S3). A few samples (12.5%) that also amplified exclusively the 8-oxoG strand rendered two bases at the same position at the 8-oxoG lesion, GT or GC (observed as double peak in the sequencing chromatogram), with one peak being predominant in most samples (reaching ratios of 45:55–22:78), which may be the result of biases occurring later in the PCR cycling.

The percentage of different substitutions observed at the 8-oxoG site is shown for SSCSs in duplex sequencing (57,092 total analyzed reads) and Sanger sequencing reads of smPCR products (25 total analyzed smPCR reactions), detailed numbers are shown in Supplementary Table S3. GC and GT in smPCR represent different nucleotides opposite the 8-oxoG in the heterogeneous peak of the sequencing chromatogram. In duplex sequencing, these are represented as an N, where N represents the presence of more than one nucleotide in the duplex sequencing reads, with the predominant nucleotide being found in less than 70% of the reads.

The 8-oxoG lesion did not result in a substitution only in ~10% of the cases. The few observed G->A substitutions (0.03%) were not significantly different from G->A substitutions at non-oxidized guanines (0.02%; P value = 0.376, Fisher’s exact test) (Supplementary Table S4) and, therefore, most likely represent synthesis errors.3.3. Fpg treatment reduces artifactual mutations caused by oxidized guaninesAfter demonstrating that 8-oxoG is an important source of artifactual mutations, we explored the efficiency of the formamidopyrimidine [fapy]-DNA glycosylase or more commonly referred as 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), an enzyme that cleaves the glycosylic bond of 8-oxoG resulting in an unamplifiable abasic site. Fpg is an enzyme often used to assess oxidative DNA damage (reviewed by Collins et al.54), but to date circle sequencing21 is the only application for which Fpg is included in the library preparation protocol for the analysis of rare sequence variants. Here, we tested the efficiency of Fpg in reducing artifact formation at 8-oxoG lesions. For this purpose, we first analyzed the HSI_insert_5 construct as a control. Our results demonstrate that Fpg can efficiently reduce artifact formation, since in all of the 50 smPCR reactions treated with Fpg, only the reverse strand (without the 8-oxoG) was amplified (Table 1). These results show that artifacts arising in smPCR at 8-oxoG lesions can be efficiently removed with pre-treatments of the DNA with the repair enzyme Fpg.We also examined whether rare 8-oxoG lesions present in larger amounts of DNA (e.g. human genomic DNA or oxidized plasmid DNA spiked with 0.33 ng of carrier DNA per smPCR reaction) are also efficiently removed by Fpg, since genomic DNA is prone to this lesion during DNA extraction or purification.29–32 To address this, we analyzed in total ~9500 smPCRs, each one representing an amplifiable human genome and ~400 smPCR reactions of one oxidized control plasmid (HSI_vector without synthetic insert). An elevated number of G->T and G->GT mutations (observed either as G->T or C->A or G->GT or C->CA, depending on which strand was used as the reference sequence) was observed with an effective mutation frequency of 1.5 × 10-6 and 1.6 × 10-4 in genomic DNA and the oxidized HSI_vector, respectively (Table 2). Fpg treatment completely eliminated G->T/C->A and G->GT/C->CA transversions on the oxidized HSI_vector and the mutation frequency was significantly reduced (P value = 1.8 × 10-5, Fisher’s exact test). Fpg treatments of genomic DNA also showed a significant ~4-fold reduction (P value = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) in G->T/C->A and G->GT/C->CA transversions (Table 2), but given already the low frequencies of this substitution, it is unclear if the remaining transversions in genomic DNA are still due to 8-oxoG lesions, other types of artifacts, or represent rare true mutations in the genome. Enzymatic removal of 8-oxoG analyzed with smPCRSanger sequences of smPCR reactions of the plasmid HSI_vector and human sperm genomic DNA were analyzed for homogeneous G->T or C->A, and heterogeneous G->GT or C->CA mutations. Samples not treated with Fpg and samples treated with Fpg (+enzyme) prior to amplification were analyzed. Mutation frequencies were calculated using the effective sites and both, single (G>T or C>A) and doublet (G>GT or C>CA) sequence chromatogram peaks. Data was obtained from 4,547 smPCR reactions of genomic DNA without and 4,921 with enzyme (Fpg) treatment, and 284 and 96 reactions for plasmid DNA without and with Fpg treatment, respectively. No G > C transversions were observed in this data.Enzymatic removal of 8-oxoG analyzed with smPCRSanger sequences of smPCR reactions of the plasmid HSI_vector and human sperm genomic DNA were analyzed for homogeneous G->T or C->A, and heterogeneous G->GT or C->CA mutations.

No G > C transversions were observed in this data.Although, we showed that Fpg can effectively eliminate rare 8-oxoG products even in larger amounts of DNA like genomic DNA, it is very important to consider that after Fpg treatment only the complementary strand without the 8-oxoG gets amplified, which could introduce other types of biases at nearby amplifiable lesions on the non 8-oxoG containing strand. In order to overcome this issue, instead of Fpg, DNA repair mixes could be used, such as available for formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples (e.g. NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix from NEB) or forensic samples (e.g. PreCR Repair Mix55), which include Fpg and other enzymes for the repair of generated abasic sites generating an amplifiable DNA template. However, this enzymatic repair is not 100% accurate and might also be a source of error.3.4. Amplification of uracil with proofreading polymerasesDeamination of cytosine is another common source of DNA damage often resulting in artifactual mutations, since it produces uracil, a base that pairs with adenine resulting in a C->T substitution. Different proofreading polymerases used in ultrasensitive protocols (e.g. Phusion Hot Start II or KAPA HiFi DNA Polymerase) amplify templates containing uracil very inefficiently. For this reason, we analyzed in this work if and how uracil lesions produce artifactual mutations when using proofreading polymerases. Specifically, we evaluated the amplification of (1) templates containing uracil in both strands, (2) templates containing uracil only in one strand, and (3) uracil containing templates treated with the repair enzyme mix uracil-specific excision reagent (USER) (a mixture of UDG and the DNA glycosylase-lyase Endonuclease VIII).First, we assessed the amplification efficiency of uracil-containing templates (HSI_insert_1, containing uracil in both strands in close proximity) by counting the number of positive smPCR reactions that amplified the HSI_insert_1. The percentage of positive smPCR reactions obtained with Phusion Hot Start II (inhibited by uracils) was compared with the positives obtained with Phusion U, a modified version of the Phusion polymerase designed to efficiently amplify uracils. The numbers of positive reactions obtained with Phusion U were close to the predicted 30.5%, based on the amount of input DNA and Poisson distribution. In comparison, with Phusion Hot Start II, we obtained a ~37.7-fold lower number of positive smPCR reactions, reflecting the lower amplification efficiency of this polymerase for uracil-containing templates (Fig. 3). An analysis of the sequence of the templates that got amplified with Phusion Hot Start II indicated that the uracil was deleted in the majority of these reads may be due to synthesis errors or alternatively due to PCR chimera formation between truncation products leading up to the uracil. One chimera was indeed observed (Supplementary Table S5). We observed a C->T mutation (or G->A) only in one read (11.1% of all successfully sequenced reads), most likely from the amplification of a uracil. This insert was not analyzed with duplex sequencing. Figure 3Open in new tabDownload slideAmplification of uracils with different Phusion polymerases with smPCR.

Error bars represent Poisson 95% CIs.Second, we analyzed the amplification of templates with only one strand containing a uracil lesion (HSI_insert_3 and insert 3), which could be a more likely scenario found in genomic DNA. In addition to a uracil in the forward strand, HSI_insert_3 had a mismatch at position 2487 used to identify the amplified strand. The overall amplification efficiency of this insert in smPCR was approximately the same as for inserts without a uracil. As expected, the majority (89.7%) of the smPCR reactions (29 in total) showed a preferential amplification of the strand without uracil (reverse strand) when using Phusion Hot Start II (Supplementary Table S5). This percentage is comparable to the measured 82.1% obtained with the KAPA HiFi DNA Polymerase for the 34,072 analyzed SSCSs reads in duplex sequencing (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S6). In rare cases, the forward strand containing the uracil was amplified in smPCR and duplex sequencing (~3% and ~18%, respectively). Uracil was sequenced as expected as a T in 50% and in 94.0% of these cases by smPCR or duplex sequencing, respectively. The frequency of this substitution was significantly different from the C->T frequency observed at Cs on the forward strand of insert 3 (Supplementary Table S4). Note that a fraction of amplified forward strands had other nucleotides instead of the uracil present at very low levels (5.9 × 10-5 to 1.5 × 10-3) representing inherent synthesis errors (Supplementary Table S6), as was also reported for the other HSI_inserts.

Based on a total of 34,072 reads for insert_3 (one uracil in the forward strand), 6,096 SSCSs were formed with the strand containing uracil (forward strand) and 27,976 for the strand without the uracil (reverse strand). After USER treatment, a total of 34,636 reads were obtained, of which, 138 and 34,498 formed SSCSs for the forward and reverse strand, respectively.

Error bars represent Poisson 95% CIs.Third, we tested the effect of the enzymatic USER treatment, a DNA enzyme mix commonly used to prevent sequencing errors due to cytosine deamination.56 The USER treatment significantly reduced the amplification of uracil containing templates of HSI_insert_1 by ~56-fold (P < 2.2 × 10-16, Fisher’s exact test) when using Phusion U for the smPCR (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained for USER treatments of insert 3 with duplex sequencing (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S6). USER reduced the percentage of amplified uracil containing strands by more than two orders of magnitude of the total sequences. Artifactual mutations (measured as the percentage of reads with a T at the position of the uracil) were reduced from 94.0% to 10.9% (16.82% to 0.04% of the total reads considering both strands), down to a frequency of 4.35 × 10 -4 equivalent to the inherent synthesis error frequency. For genomic DNA that was amplified with Phusion Hot Start II, mutation frequencies were already so low that significant differences with USER treatments could not be measured (Supplementary Table S7). No C->T transitions were observed for the plasmid (HSI_vector).These data show that the amplification of templates containing uracil using polymerases like Phusion Hot Start II or KAPA HiFi DNA polymerase resulted in a strong biased amplification of the strand without the uracil. This effectively reduced the number of mutational artifacts in smPCR and duplex sequencing resulting from this type of lesion. However, these polymerases alone are not sufficient to completely eliminate artifactual mutations arising from uracil lesions present in one DNA strand. Indeed, approximately one-fifth of all reads were amplified from templates with an initial uracil, leading to a C->T substitution. USER treatments considerably reduced this artifact. It is possible that USER can eliminate additional uracils, but we do not have the power to distinguish artifacts from synthesis errors at these low levels.3.5. Heteroduplexes in double-stranded DNA lead to artifactual mutations due to strand amplification biasA more difficult lesion to detect and remove is the deamination product of 5-methylcytosine. While most DNA lesions result in bases not naturally occurring in the DNA that can be removed by DNA repair enzymes, some lesions cannot be distinguished from native DNA. One example is the deamination product of 5-methylcytosine resulting in thymine which forms a T/G mismatch in double-stranded DNA. Thus, in this work, we also analyzed whether these lesions forming mismatches can be distinguished and filtered out, e.g. using smPCR. For this purpose, we first created the HSI_insert_2 construct that contains three different randomly placed DNA mismatches (A/C, A/G and T/G). If both strands are amplified, then the mismatches should be identifiable downstream in the resulting data (e.g. as a doublet/heterogenous chromatogram peak).Our results show that more than half of all smPCR reactions of HSI_insert_2 (31 reactions in total) show a strand amplification bias, or ‘PCR jackpot’, in which only the forward or the reverse strand was amplified in ~23% and ~26% of the reactions, respectively (Table 3). In all these reactions, the sequencing chromatogram showed a peak of just one nucleotide (homogeneous peak) instead of the expected doublet chromatogram. This strand amplification bias was confirmed by three independent bases in the sequencing read (AAT or GCC for the forward or reverse strand, respectively), making this observation rather unlikely the result of a sequencing error. For those reactions in which both strands were amplified, the amount of rendered smPCR product varied for the different strands, ranging from ratios of 80/20 to 50/50 in the chromatograms for all three different heteroduplexes (Table 3). Summing up the frequency of the forward or the reverse strand, each strand is represented in almost equal proportions. Similar amplification proportions were also obtained with duplex sequencing, with 21,807 reads (48.2%) and 23,396 (51.8%) for the forward strand and the reverse strand, respectively; however, a specific strand amplification bias cannot be accurately measured with duplex sequencing since additional factors during library preparation can also cause an absence of a strand in this method (e.g. incomplete ligation of the duplex adapters). Amplification behavior of different mismatches in double-stranded DNAThe number of smPCR reactions (n) in which only the forward strand, only the reverse strand, or both strands were amplified, is shown for the HSI_insert_2 construct (with three mismatches) and the HSI_insert_4 construct (with one mismatch). The identity of the bases in the sequencing results of the forward strand is inferred from positions 2487 (A/C mismatch), 2498 (A/G mismatch), and 2509 (T/G mismatch) in the HSI_insert_2 construct, and for position 2486 (T/G mismatch) in the HSI_insert_4 construct. Nucleotides in the table represent the sequences after mapping to the forward strand. In one smPCR sequence, a heterozygous deletion of one of the analyzed bases was observed, which most likely represents a synthesis error. Note that HSI_insert_2 was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and HSI_insert_4 by genotyping.Amplification behavior of different mismatches in double-stranded DNAThe number of smPCR reactions (n) in which only the forward strand, only the reverse strand, or both strands were amplified, is shown for the HSI_insert_2 construct (with three mismatches) and the HSI_insert_4 construct (with one mismatch).

Note that HSI_insert_2 was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and HSI_insert_4 by genotyping.When analyzing templates with only one mismatch (HSI_insert_4 construct), which represents the deamination product of a 5-methylcytosine in the context of a CpG site, similar results were obtained suggesting that a strand amplification bias is a common phenomenon in smPCR regardless of the sequence. For this experiment, we screened the amplified strand by genotyping position 2486, which contains the mismatch (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Figs S1 and S2), allowing us to screen a higher number of reactions (78 total reactions). As shown in Table 3, both strands, only the forward, or the reverse strand were amplified in 25.6%, 38.5%, and 35.9% of the cases, respectively. The number of smPCR reactions in which both strands were amplified varies between the HSI_insert_2 and HSI_insert_4 construct (51.6% versus 25.6%); however, this can be due to random sampling since only 31 smPCR reactions were analyzed for the HSI_insert_2 construct (P = 0.1, Fisher’s exact test).3.6. Strand amplification biasis an important source of artifactual mutations in templates with lesionsWe have shown that templates with lesions that are amplified very efficiently by PCR can lead to artifactual mutations. However, so far it was not obvious how lesions in one strand of a double-stranded template could lead to artifactual mutations, especially in applications analyzing the products of single-molecule amplifications such as droplet digital PCR.15 Assuming that both strands of a double-stranded DNA template are amplified with the same efficiency, positions with mismatches or specific amplifiable lesions should appear as reads with more than one nucleotide that can be identified and filtered out. In our smPCR data for the 8-oxoG lesions (HSI_insert_5), both strands (forward and reverse) were amplified only in 17.9% of the smPCR reactions (Table 1). However, in the majority of the cases (82.1%), only one of the both strands was used as a template for amplification, with either the forward (8-oxoG) or the reverse (deletion) strand being amplified in 44.6% or 37.5% of the times, respectively. The reactions that only amplified the strand containing the 8-oxoG lesion resulted in substitutions that could not be differentiated from bona fide G->T or G->C mutations.Interestingly, our smPCR data for the highly oxidized plasmid (HSI_vector) also possibly indicated strand amplification bias. The sequencing reads showed single chromatogram peaks or bona fide G->T substitutions (observed previously in our vector-insert constructs from strand amplification bias). These were as frequent as doublet chromatogram peaks G->GT or C->CA (likely representing the product of the amplification of both strands). Both types of peaks (single and doublet chromatograms) got eliminated with the Fpg treatment (Table 2), suggesting that the bona fide G > T substitution was the result of an 8-oxoG lesion that got likely enriched by a strand amplification bias. Similar results were also observed for smPCR of genomic DNA.A strand amplification bias was observed in at least a third or even a higher proportion of smPCR reactions with synthetic samples for which an equal efficiency in the amplification of forward and reverse strands was expected (HSI_insert_2, 4, 5, and 6). This strand amplification bias would also explain why amplifiable lesions such as mismatches, deamination products of 5-meC or 8-oxoG can result in artifactual mutations, especially if the strand carrying the lesion is exclusively amplified, propagating artifactual mutations by the known ‘PCR jackpot’ effect that cannot be filtered out with standard sequencing set-ups.3.7. Effect of sample storage and preparation on artifactual mutationsDNA extraction and storage can introduce different types of amplifiable DNA lesions leading to false base calls.29–33,57 To analyze these effects, we treated the HSI_insert_6 construct (containing eight 5-methylcytosines, four on each strand, in the context of CpG sites, and two T/G mismatches) with different storage and heating conditions. For this experiment, 5 × 107 molecules of freshly prepared HSI_insert_6 construct were either (1) never frozen (control); (2) frozen at -20 °C for 24 h (frozen); or (3) treated with a standard genomic DNA extraction protocol with a 2 hour incubation at 65 °C (heated) (Materials and Methods section). In total, we analyzed 320 methylated CpG sites with smPCR, but did not observe a deamination event since we did not have the power (with only 320 analyzed 5-meCs) to accurately determine the deamination rate (<3.13 × 10 - 3; Supplementary Table S8). We also analyzed the effect of the different sample storage and preparations on all mutations in general. The lowest number of artifactual mutations was obtained in control molecules (control), and was highest in molecules treated with the DNA extraction protocol including a heating step (heated), with a significant difference between control, and extracted and heated samples in the total number of artifactual mutations (P = 0.03, Fisher’s Exact Test) (Table 4). However, given that the number of analyzed samples by smPCR, and therefore, the number of effective sites per treatment type was low, we performed a similar experiment with duplex sequencing. Effect of sample storage and preparation on the mutation ratesmPCR reactions of the HSI_insert_6 construct were either collected right after construct generation (untreated control), after storage of an aliquot at - 20 °C for 24 h (frozen), or after performance of the DNA extraction protocol on an aliquot (heated) with a 2 h heating step at 65 °C (25, 24, and 29 reactions were analyzed for the different treatments, respectively). Different mutations found in the samples are reported in the table, n gives the number of found mutations, µ is the mutation frequency (n/effective sites for a mutation type) for the different types of observed mutations.Effect of sample storage and preparation on the mutation ratesmPCR reactions of the HSI_insert_6 construct were either collected right after construct generation (untreated control), after storage of an aliquot at - 20 °C for 24 h (frozen), or after performance of the DNA extraction protocol on an aliquot (heated) with a 2 h heating step at 65 °C (25, 24, and 29 reactions were analyzed for the different treatments, respectively). Different mutations found in the samples are reported in the table, n gives the number of found mutations, µ is the mutation frequency (n/effective sites for a mutation type) for the different types of observed mutations.For duplex sequencing, we reanalyzed the formation of artifacts in slightly different treated/stored samples of insert 6: without treatment (control); three freeze-thaw cycles (frozen); heating to 65 °C for 3 h (heated). In total, 51,996, 48,302, and 25,157 5-methylcytosines were obtained for the control, frozen, and heated samples, respectively (only the six 5-methylcytosines located in the middle of insert 6 were used for the analysis to avoid a bias from the end-repair introduced during sequencing-library preparation). The observed deamination frequencies were 8.65 × 10-4, 9.11 × 10-4, 1.07 × 10 - 3 for control, frozen, and heated samples, respectively (45, 44, and 27 total events), with a slightly increased deamination frequency at 5-meC sites rendering C->T artifactual mutations (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S9) and were significantly higher than the inherent synthesis errors. The C->T transitions were significantly higher for methylated Cs compared with non-methylated Cs (~3.7-fold). This represents a higher difference compared with what is reported for hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine and non-methylated Cs in double-stranded DNA (2.2-fold difference in the rate constants),58,59 but could be attributed to the 1,000× faster deamination of 5-meC when heating single-stranded DNA. Considering that a high temperature was used during the hybridization step of our synthetic fragments (when the inserts were single-stranded), the larger difference in deamination products between 5-meC and C is not surprising. Additionally, partial inhibition of amplification by the deamination product of C (uracil) might have an effect on the increased difference. Given that heat plays an important role in the deamination rate, avoidance of extensive heating steps that induce single-stranded DNA during extraction and DNA preparation can decrease the formation of this lesion, especially when the source DNA is highly methylated. Thus, heat should be avoided to reduce the formation of artifactual mutations.

Significance values were estimated using a Fisher’s exact test.We also analyzed with duplex sequencing the effect of sample storage and heat treatment in insert 6 on the formation of other types of artifactual mutations (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S9). Repeated freeze–thaw cycles at -20 °C did not have a significant effect on observed mutation frequencies—neither for the individual substitution types nor for the total number of mutations. Heating the sample to 65 °C (for 3 h), which is a common step during tissue lysis in the extraction of DNA, significantly increased the total frequency of artifactual mutations by ~1.4-fold (P = 4.87 × 10 -7, Fisher’s exact test). When analyzing the individual mutation types separately, only two types of transversions showed a significant difference from the untreated control, with G->T transversions having the most predominant effect (P = 5.04 × 10 -13, Fisher’s exact test) and with C->G transversions being on the border of significance (P = 0.04, Fisher’s exact test). These results show that especially heat (either in combination with DNA extraction or heat treatment alone) has the power to increase artifactual mutations, predominately G->T transversions. Interestingly, the sequence context also played a role in the frequency of the G->T transversion with G in the context of CGG, GGG, or GGT showing a significantly higher transversion frequency in heated samples compared with control or frozen samples (Supplementary Fig. S5).The main type of increased artifactual mutations with heat were G->T transversions (2.4-fold increase compared with the untreated control), which could have resulted from heat-induced ROS formation, as described previously.35 This difference between heated and non-heated samples could be even greater, but not measurable at the error rates of our synthetic templates. Within many commercially available genomic DNA extraction kits, the proteinase K digest or DNA rehydration is performed at elevated temperatures (exact temperatures and incubation times depend on the used kit, sample type, and input sample amount). Just some random examples are the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit from Promega, in which DNA rehydration is recommended at 65 °C for 1 h, the DNA Extraction Kit from Stratagene that includes a pronase digestion at 55 °C for 2 h or 60 °C for 1 h depending on the sample type, or the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit from QIAGEN, in which for DNA extraction from animal tissue heating to 65 °C for 1–8 h is suggested for the proteinase K digest. Additionally, we have to consider that samples are heated not only within the DNA extraction protocol itself. If, for example, a restriction digest is required in an application, protocols often include a heat-inactivation of the enzyme (an incubation at 80 °C for 20 min is suggested for many commercially available restriction enzymes). Finally, PCR itself requires very high initial temperatures above 90 °C. Not all the heating steps can be avoided, but precautions can be taken in experiments to reduce extensive DNA oxidation during sample preparation, which can include the decrease of temperature during cell lysis (proteinase K digestion) and DNA rehydration to 37 °C, with an increase in the incubation time, or the exclusion of an heat inactivation step after a restriction enzyme digest and the use of DNA repair enzymes.4. ConclusionsIn this work, we demonstrated that amplifiable lesions play an important role in increasing the number of artifactual mutations, and have to be considered in ultrasensitive detection technologies such as smPCR sequencing or NGS applications. While duplex sequencing22 can effectively discriminate between template lesions and real mutations, most other ultrasensitive detection methods do not have this power. Even in applications using smPCR, lesions can lead to artifactual mutations due to the strand amplification bias of single DNA strands. Therefore, it is very important to reduce lesion formation by diminishing ROS formation and heating steps, as well as by including treatments with DNA repair enzymes. Moreover, it is critical to estimate the lesion induced artifactual mutation rate in control samples and correct for this value when estimating ‘true’ mutation rates.The authors are grateful to Kristin Eckert and Suzanne Hile for experimental advice regarding establishing duplex sequencing and to Wilfried Guiblet for computational suggestions.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.The supplementary data file contains: Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Figs S1–S5 and Supplementary Tables S1–S9.FundingThis work was supported by the ‘Austrian Science Fund’ (FWF) P25525-B13 to I.T-B., the DOC Fellowship of the Austrian Academy of Sciences 23722 to B.A., the Marshall Plan Scholarship of the Austrian Marshall Plan Foundation 53772424132014 to B.A., and an NIH Grant R01 GM116044 to K.D.M.

IntroductionTaxonomically, brown algae (Phaeophyceae) belong to the Stramenopiles and include multicellular species.1 They are photosynthetic organisms with chloroplasts surrounded by four membranes,2 suggesting that they originated from a symbiotic relationship between two eukaryotes.3 Most brown algae contain the pigment, fucoxanthin, which is responsible for the distinctive greenish-brown color that gives brown algae their common name. Phaeophytes include many types of seaweed in the Northern Hemisphere, and they are important members of marine ecosystems, both because they create habitats for other organisms and because they provide food.4Cladosiphon okamuranus (Chordariales, Phaeophyceae),5 Okinawa mozuku in Japanese, is one of the important edible seaweeds. In Okinawa, C. okamuranus has been cultivated for more than 35 years by several fishermen’s associations, including those in Onna and Chinen Villages. This cultivation history has established several strains of mozuku that have similar morphology and texture. It was reported in the 36th annual report of the Japanese Cabinet Office that approximately 20 kilotons of mozuku (C. okamuranus and Nemacystus decipiens (‘Itomozuku’)) are produced annually, yielding approximately 4 billion Japanese yen in 2006. In addition, C. okamuranus and N. decipiens are sources of fucoidan,6 a sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell-wall matrix of brown algae that has anti-coagulant, anti-thrombin-like, and tumor-suppressant activities.7 Brown algae also produce alginates.8,9Due to their biological significance, genomes of two species of brown algae have been decoded: Ectocarpus siliculosus (Order Ectocarpales10) and Saccharina japonica (Order Laminariales11). The genome size of former is approximately 214 Mbp with 16,256 predicted protein-coding genes, while that of the latter is 545 Mbp with 18,733 predicted protein-coding genes. Several genetic features of the two brown algae have been characterized to understand their biology.10,11 A close phylogenetic relationship between Ectocarpales and Chordariales has been reported.5,12 Given its importance for fisheries, food, and possible pharmaceuticals, we decoded the draft genome of Cladosiphon okamuranus S-strain, (Order Chordariales).2. Materials and methods2.1. Strain and DNA extractionThe S-strain of Cladosiphon okamuranus (‘Shikenjo-kabu’) has been maintained as a stock culture at the Okinawa Prefectural Fisheries Research and Extension Center, Okinawa, Japan. It is cultivated at 22.5° C with a 12-h light-dark cycle in sea water containing 0.5% KW21 (Daiichi Seimo Co., Ltd). The life cycle of C. okamuranus includes both haploid (n) and diploid (2n) generations (Fig. 1). 2n germlings mature into sporophytes that are harvested for market. For DNA extraction, 2n germlings of C. okamuranus were frozen in liquid nitrogen and crushed to powder with a frozen-cell-crusher, Cryo-Press (Microtec Co., Ltd). Genomic DNA was extracted from the powder using an extraction kit, DNA-Suisui-VS (Rizo Co., Ltd).

Genome sequencing and assemblyThe Illumina platform (Miseq and Hiseq 2500) was used for sequencing.13 Libraries were prepared according to slight modifications of protocols provided by the manufacturer. Fragmented genomic DNA was further purified using Blue Pippin (Sage Science). A paired-end library consisting of clones ~720 bp was prepared for the Miseq using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina), and 3-kb and 8-kb mate-pair libraries were prepared for the Hiseq 2500 using a Nextera Mate Pair Sample Prep Kit (Illumina), respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Longer reads were obtained by using more reagent kits for the Hiseq. K-mer counting and estimation of genome size were performed using JELLYFISH 2.2.0 software.14,15Adapter sequences were trimmed from all reads using Trimmomatic-0.30.16 Paired-end reads of high quality (quality value = 20) were assembled de novo using Newbler 2.9 (GS Assembler) to create contigs. Then subsequent scaffolding of the Newbler output was performed using SSPACE 3.0,17 based on Illumina mate-pair information. Gaps inside scaffolds were closed using GapCloser 1.12.18 Diploid sequences of gap-closed scaffolds were merged with Haplomerger-2-20151124.19 CEGMA 2.5 software20 was used to evaluate genome assembly. The mitochondrial genome was generated with the IDBA_UD 1.1.1 assembler.212.3. Transcriptome analysesRNA was isolated from sporophytes (2–5 cm) and 2n germlings (Fig. 1). Total RNA was extracted following the instructions of the manufacturer using DNase and an RNeasy Plant mini kit (QIAGEN). Transcriptome libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit (Illumina). RNAs were sequenced as per the manufacturer’s instructions for the Illumina Hiseq 2500. Only sequences of high quality (quality value = 20) were assembled, using Velvet 1.2.1022 and Oases 0.2.08.232.4. Gene model predictionA set of gene model predictions (C. okamuranus Gene Model ver. 1) was generated using AUGUSTUS 3.2.1.24 AUGUSTUS was trained on the 9120 transcriptome contigs recommended by PASA 2.0.225 for this purpose. Gene models were produced by running AUGUSTUS on a repeat-masked genome, produced with RepeatMasker 4.0.6 (http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/RM/RepeatMasker.html) and refined with PASA.2.5. Transposable elements and repetitive sequencesRepetitive sequences were detected as described previously.26 Tandem repeats were detected using Tandem Repeat Finder (version 4.04),27 and then classified using RepeatModeler-1.1.8 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html). A de novo repeats library was generated with RepeatScout (version 1.0.5).28 Transposons and SINE in the scaffold were identified with CENSOR (version 4.2)29 using Blast searches against the Repbase TE library (version 16.05).302.6. Gene annotation and identificationThree approaches, individually or in combination, were used to annotate protein-coding genes in the C. okamuranus genome. The primary approach for identification of putative C. okamuranus orthologous genes was reciprocal BLAST analysis. This was carried out using mutual best hits of genes of E. siliculosus10 against the C. okamuranus gene models (BLASTP) or the assembly (TBLASTN). A second approach used for genes encoding proteins with one or more specific protein domains, was to screen the models against the Pfam database (Pfam-A.hmm, release 24.0; http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk),31 which contains approximately 11,000 conserved domains using HMMER (hmmer3).32In the case of complex multigene families, a third annotation method was employed; sets of related sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses in order to more precisely determine orthologous relationships between proteins of C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus. For this purpose, amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT33 with default options. Gaps and ambiguous areas were excluded using SeaView version 4.5.334 manually. Based on alignment datasets, phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 5.235 using the best model with 1,000 bootstrap duplications.2.7. Genome browserA genome browser has been established for the assembled genome sequences using the JavaScript-based Genome Browser (JBrowse) 1.11.6.36 The assembled sequence and gene models are accessible at http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/gallery/.2.8 Gene expression analysisRNA-seq reads were aligned to the genome using TopHat-2.0.9,37 while FPKM values were calculated from the aligned results using Cufflinks v2.0.0.38 Gene expression levels were visualized with R 3.2.2 (https://www.r-project.org/) using the pheatmap 1.0.8 package.39,403. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe Illumina Miseq (average library size, 720 bp) generated a total of 9.75 gigabase pairs (Gbp) of paired-end sequence data (read length, 309 ×2 bases) and the Hiseq2500 generated 5.79 Gbp of mate-pair sequence data (read length, 283 ×2 bases); 5.02 Gbp for the 3-kb library (physical coverage, 177×) and 0.78 Gbp for the 8-kb library (physical coverage, 73×), respectively. A total of 15.6 Gbp of sequence data was obtained (Supplementary Table S1). As mentioned below, the genome size of Cladosiphon okamuranus was estimated as approximately 140 Mb (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Total reads of 15.6 Gbp correspond to approximately 100x sequencing coverage of the genome. Comparison of draft genome assemblies of three species of brown algae, Cladosiphon okamuranus (Order Chordariales), Ectocarpus siliculosus (Order Ectocarpales), and Saccharina japonica (Order Laminariales)aThe present study.bCock et al.10cYe et al.11Comparison of draft genome assemblies of three species of brown algae, Cladosiphon okamuranus (Order Chordariales), Ectocarpus siliculosus (Order Ectocarpales), and Saccharina japonica (Order Laminariales)aThe present study.bCock et al.10cYe et al.11Illumina whole-genome, shotgun paired-end reads were assembled de novo with Newbler. The assembler generated 31,858 contigs with an N50 size of 21.7 kb (Table 1). The longest contig was 943.8 kb and approximately 40% of the sequences were covered by contigs >2 kb. Subsequent scaffolding of the 31,858 contigs of Newbler output was performed with SSPACE using Illumina mate-pair sequence information (Supplementary Table S1). Gaps inside scaffolds were closed with GapCloser. As a result, the final assembly contained 732 scaffolds with an N50 size of 536 kb. The total scaffold length reached 170 Mb.Bacterial contaminant scaffolds were identified in the genome of an Ectocarpus siliculosus strain.10 To detect scaffolds of likely bacterial origin, 732 scaffolds were classified into one large group (129.9 Mb containing 541 scaffolds) and seven smaller groups (3.6–8.0 Mb) using MaxBin software,41 which bins assembled microbial scaffolds, based on tetranucleotide frequencies, scaffold coverage levels and marker sequences. Using transcriptome mapping of C. okamuranus (See later) and similarities to Ectocarpus genes, it was confirmed that the large group contained Cladosiphon okamuranus scaffolds. All scaffolds of smaller groups had no mapped transcriptomes that showed exon–intron structures. For 541 scaffolds of C. okamuranus, the number of contigs was 2,774 and the N50 of contigs was 88 kb. The longest scaffold was 2.8 Mbp, and the scaffold N50 was 416 kb (Table 1). Approximately 87% of scaffold sequences were covered with contigs of >20 kb. Chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences were included in scaffold IDs, Cok_S_s60 (599,436 bp) and Cok_S_s1074 (36,249 bp), respectively (data not shown).CEGMA analysis was carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the assembled genome (129.9 Mb). CEGMA reported 91.9% sequences (CEGMA partial) with an average degree of completeness for all sequences of 84.3%. On the other hand, CEGMA completeness values for genome sequences of E. siliculosus and S. japonica are 77.4% and 45.6% (Table 1), respectively, suggesting the assembled genome of C. okamuranus is the highest quality brown algal genome to date.3.2. Genome sizeThe genome size of C. okamuranus was estimated by K-mer analysis (K-mer = 25). The peak appeared around 47 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The estimated genome size was ~140 Mb. The C. okamuranus genome is the smallest phaeophyte genome sequenced to date (Table 1). The genome size of E. siliculosus was estimated to be 214 Mbp while that of S. japonica was 545 Mb (Table 1).10,113.3. GC contentGC content of the C. okamuranus genome was estimated to be ~54% (Supplementary Fig. S1B and Table 1). GC contents for E. siliculosus and S. japonica were 54% and 50%, respectively; thus, the three brown algae are similar in this regard (Table 1).3.4. RNAseq, clustering, and mappingTranscriptomic analysis is essential to determine which genes are expressed by a given organism. RNAs extracted from germlings and sporophytes were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 (read length, 329 ×2 bases from both samples) (Supplementary Table S1). About 44.8 giga nucleotide reads were obtained.An assembly of transcriptome sequences yielded 59,590 contigs (92.8 mega nucleotides (nts)) with an N50 size of 2,231 nts. Of those, 58,095 (97.4%) had a blat alignment (with default settings) to the assembled genome sequences (129.9 Mb). 37,299 of the 59,590 contigs had predicted ORFs from start to stop codons of at least 450 nts. Of these putatively full-length RNA-seq contigs, 36,648 (98.6%) had a blat alignment to assembled scaffolds (129.9 Mb). These data were used to produce gene models for annotation.3.5. Gene modelingAssembled RNAseqs of C. okamuranus, algae EST datasets available on NCBI and putative protein coding loci found with PASA, were incorporated as AUGUSTUS ‘hints.’ The number of gene models was 13,640 (Table 1). This is somewhat smaller than the 16,256 predicted genes of E. siliculosus and the 18,733 of S. japonica, respectively, although this value is comparable. The 12,813 genes of C. okamuranus were supported by mRNA sequences.The average (arithmetic mean) length of C. okamuranus genes that included both exons and introns, was 7,696 bp, and that of exons translated to form proteins (coding sequence) was 2,004 bp. The average lengths of C. okamuranus 5' and 3'UTRs were 911 bp and 459 bp, respectively. Cock et al.10 noted that E. siliculosus genes are intron-rich, with an average number of introns per gene of 6.98 and an average intron length of 704 bp (Table 1). This was the case in the C. okamuranus genome; the average number of introns per gene was 8.26 and the average intron length was 522 bp (Table 1).3.6. Transposable elements and other genomic componentsWe examined the proportion of transposable elements and repetitive elements in the assembled mozuku genome. DNA transposons and retrotransposons apparently account for 0.539% and 2.491% of the C. okamuranus genome, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). DNA transposons included hAT (0.104% of the assembled sequences), EnSpm (0.090%), Helitron (0.084%), PIF-Harbinger (0.056%) and others, while retrotransposons included LTR retrotransposons such as Gypsy (1.096%), Copia (0.752%) and Bel_Pao (0.115%), and non-LTR retrotransposons such as CR1 (0.040%) and I (0.018%). The percentages of LINE (long interspersed nuclear elements) such as L1 (0.123%), Tx1, and Jockey, and SINE (short interspersed nuclear elements) were smaller in the C. okamuranus genome, compared to other brown algal genomes.Including unclassified repeats, 4.1% of the C. okamuranus genome was composed of repetitive sequences (Table 1). This ratio is lower than in the two other brown algae, 22.7% for E. siliculosus and 39% for S. japonica, respectively. It may be that the high frequency of repeated sequences in brown algal genomes is not universal among the Phaeophyceae.3.7. Identification of Cladosiphon okamuranus genesIn order to examine the utility of the assembled genome as a platform for future studies in mozuku biology, we searched for genes in the assembled C. okamuranus genome. By comparing genes found in the E. siliculosus genome,10 we found the corresponding mozuku genes associated with transcription factors, signaling molecules, and enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis and phlorotannin biosynthesis.3.7.1 Transcription factorsTranscription factors play pivotal roles in many biological processes. We examined transcription factors (TFs) by searching conserved protein domains using hmmer3 and the Pfam database (e-value cutoff < e -5). The number of domains that have been identified in transcription factors was determined and compared with those in the E. siliculosus genome. These domains include HSF, Myb, bZIP, Zinc Finger, bHLH, CCAAT-binding, homeobox, AP2-EREBP, Nin-like, TAF, E2F-DP, CBF/NF-Y/archaeal and Sigma-70 r2/r3/r4 (Table 2). Number of transcription factors (TFs) in the brown algae, Cladosiphon okamuranus and Ectocarpus siliculosusaPercentage of the family within the brown algal genome.Number of transcription factors (TFs) in the brown algae, Cladosiphon okamuranus and Ectocarpus siliculosusaPercentage of the family within the brown algal genome.This analysis showed that the C. okamuranus genome contains 214 transcription factor genes (Table 2), fewer than the 260 found in the E. siliculosus genome. However, the ratio of transcription factor genes to total genes was ~1.6% in both genomes. The most abundant TF in both genomes was the Myb family, with 58 and 59 genes in the C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus genomes, respectively. The next most abundant TFs were CBF/NF-Y/archaeal (35), Zinc Finger C2H2-type (23) and Zinc Finger CCCH-type (22). The C. okamuranus genome likely contains three genes for bHLH domains, three for homeobox domains and 17 genes for bZIP domains. The expression level of bZIP genes seems to be similar in germlings and sporophytes, whereas some of CBF/NF-Y/archaeal genes may have different expression levels (Fig. 2A). Expression and function of phaeophyte TF genes should be expressly examined in future studies.

Cock et al.10 specifically analyzed membrane-spanning receptor kinase genes, since receptor kinases have been shown to function in developmental processes in both animals and green plants. They showed that Ectocarpus receptor kinases form a monophyletic clade, as in the case of animals and plants, suggesting that brown algae evolved independently of other taxa. The present domain analysis, using the Pfam database, showed that the C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus genomes contain 286 and 338 genes for protein kinase domains, which are both equivalent to about 2.1% of total genes.Cock et al.10 also identified five genes for stramenopile-lineage-specific receptor kinases in E. siliculosus.10 The C. okamuranus genome likely contains at least two genes for brown algal-specific receptor kinases (Cok_S_s144_12294 and Cok_S_s043_7434), which have orthologous relationships with E. siliculosus genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Three other genes are additional candidates (Cok_S_s126_11689, Cok_S_s097_10483 and Cok_S_s044_7515). All five genes are found on different scaffolds. RNA-seq reads demonstrate that Cok_S_s144_12294 is expressed in both germlings and sporophytes (Fig. 2B).3.7.3. Genes associated with biosynthesis of polysaccharidesGenes encoding enzymes for polysaccharide metabolism in brown algae have been predicted in the E. siliculosus genome.9 Using informatics methods, we investigated gene families for biosynthesis of sulphated fucans and alginates, compounds characteristic of brown algae. Genes encoding enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways are apparently conserved between C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus, although downstream enzymes of the polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways are likely to be expanded in each lineage.3.7.3.1 FucoidansFucoidans are a family of sulfated homo- and heteropolysaccharides of brown algae that include L-fucose residues. The family comprises a broad spectrum of polysaccharides, from compounds with high uronic acid content and very little fucose and sulfate, to almost pure a-l-fucan, in which the dominant monosaccharide is fucose. GDP-mannose and l-fucose are original sources of GDP-fucose, which is then transformed from fucan to sulfated fucan (Fig. 3A). Seven enzymes are likely involved in this pathway (Fig. 3A).

Two enzymatic genes that contain sulphotransferase and hydrolase domains are clustered with a gene (magenta) for a bifunctional enzyme with FK and GHMP-kinase domains. Genes coloured grey encode conserved proteins with RNA-binding domains.Examination of genes for enzymes in both the C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus genomes identified two genes encoding GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and one for GDP-l-fucose synthase (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S3). The presence of a candidate gene (FK-GFPP) for a bifunctional enzyme possessing both l-fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase activities was identified in the C. okamuranus genome (Fig. 3A). These enzyme genes were expressed at germling and sporophyte stages (Fig. 2C). Comparison of the C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus genomes revealed syntenic localization of enzyme genes, suggesting the presence of an enzymatic gene cluster in both species (Fig. 3B). Two other enzymatic genes that contain a sulfotransferase domain and a hydrolase domain are clustered with FK-GFPP. The 3' region of FK-GFPP contains an ankyrin-repeat domain (Fig. 3B).In addition, the C. okamuranus and E. siliculosus genomes contain four genes for fucosyltransferase, and six genes for sulfotransferase, respectively (Fig. 3A). Identification of genes that encode enzymes involved in sulfated fucan biosynthesis suggests that C. okamuranus provides a good source of fucoidans, which should be further characterized in future studies.3.7.3.2. AlginatesAlginates are cell-wall constituents of brown algae. They are chain-forming heteropolysaccharides consisting of blocks of mannuronic acid and glucuronic acid. Composition of the blocks varies by species and by the part of the thallus from which the extraction is made. Enzymes involved in the alginate biosynthetic pathway, including GDP-mannose 6-dehydrogenase (GMD) and mannuronate C5-epimerase (MC5E), have been identified in genomes of E. siliculosus9 and C. okamuranus (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S3). The number of enzymatic genes is comparable in both species. Some of MC5E-coding genes likely have different expression levels in germlings and sporophytes (Fig. 2C). These expression data will be useful for functional analyses of these enzymes.

Examination of the C. okamuranus genome and further molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that the C. okamuranus genome also contains three GMD genes for this key enzyme (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary Table S3). Twenty-four MC5E genes of C. okamuranus have homology to E. siliculosus genes (Supplementary Table S3). Our survey suggests that MC5E genes are independently expanded in each lineage.3.7.3.3. Phlorotannin biosynthesisBrown algal phenols attract considerable attention due to the wide variety of biological activities and potential health benefits of phlorotannins.42,43 Phlorotannins are known only from brown algae and are structural analogs of condensed tannins, such as anthocyanidins and other flavonoid derivatives, a diverse class of metabolites with a vast array of functions in terrestrial plants.44 They probably serve multiple ecological functions in brown algae, such as antifouling substances45 and chemical defenses against herbivory,46 in addition to providing UV protection for intertidal seaweeds.47 Their chemical structures are based on aryl-aryl and/or diaryl ether linkages of phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) units and are rather complex. Polymerization leads to a wide range of molecular masses (10 and 100 kDa).48,49Polyketide synthase (PKS) is a key gene for phlorotannin biosynthesis.50 It has recently been reported that E. siliculosus PKS1 was classified as a Type-III PKS.50 We surveyed PKS genes in the C. okamuranus genome and found two candidate genes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S3). Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that C. okamuranus Cok_S_597_t3 is the ortholog of E. siliculosus PKS1, a key gene in phlorotannin biosynthesis. E. siliculosus has three type III PKS genes. On the other hand, C. okamuranus has only two (PKS1 and PKS2) and has probably lost PKS3. PKS1 and PKS2 are expressed in germlings and sporophytes of C. okamuranus (Fig. 2C). Type III PKS genes of brown algae probably originated with bacteria.

IntroductionNow that the genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, their comprehensive annotation is required to fully understand the functional elements that are encoded therein.1–3 Although the focus of much of this annotation is of longer open reading frames (ORFs), there is growing appreciation that the much less studied small ORFs (sORFs), historically defined as <100 amino acids (aa) in length, may prove to be as widely significant in many biological processes as the larger class.4–16 For example, the tarsal-less (tal) gene in Drosophila, which was previously thought to be a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been found to contain four conserved sORFs encoding three 11-aa and one 32-aa peptides, that are required for embryonic tracheal development and leg morphogenesis.5,13,17 Similarly, a conserved 56-aa peptide encoded by the Toddler gene in zebrafish has been found to function as a mitogen to promote cell migration during gastrulation.18However, what has primarily hindered our appreciation of the extent to which the sORFs are biologically significant is, in fact, their reliable identification, the necessary first step before any detailed functional characterization.19,20 In general, strictly bioinformatic approaches require a large number of experimentally validated ORFs to serve as a training set to enable subsequent de novo prediction, but there are presently not a sufficient number of identified sORFs for this purpose. Alternatively, ORFs can be identified based on conservation alone, but for that, reliable prediction generally requires sequences that encode peptides that are longer than 100-aa.21–26 Direct identification of translated peptides in the cell by proteomic methods is also often highly effective, however these methods are well known to be inefficient at detecting proteins of small size.10,27,28 Thus, it is highly likely that many sORFs have been misclassified as lncRNAs or missed entirely from present annotation.Several attempts have been made to identify sORFs on a genome-wide scale in model organisms such as Drosophila using more targeted bioinformatics approaches.29–32 Yet, while this work suggests that there may be thousands of sORFs translated in these organisms, there is presently a lack of experimental translational verification for the majority of the predictions. Perhaps the most successful experimental method to identify sORFs so far has been deep sequencing of ribosome-associated RNA.10,31–33 However, recent work has suggested that ribosome occupancy alone is insufficient to unequivocally conclude that a potential sORF is indeed translated.34,35 Instead, combining deep sequencing of ribosome-associated RNAs with bioinformatics analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to identify translated sORFs, genome-wide.34–37Of the few well characterized sORFs, a surprisingly large fraction, like tal and Toddler mentioned above, has been found to play vital roles during development.14,16–18,38,39 We thus speculated that there might be a large number of presently unannotated sORFs that perform critical functions during development, and that identifying the complete repertoire of translated sORFs during embryogenesis would prove both a useful strategy to identify a large set of sORFs to aid de novo sORF prediction as well as a necessary resource to understand this fundamental biological process.Thus, to this end, we have performed ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs together with conservation analyses to identify conserved translated sORFs during the first 4 hours of embryogenesis in Drosophila, the period during which control shifts from maternal- to zygotic-encoded transcripts.40 Overall, we have identified 399 sORFs that are translated during early embryogenesis, which substantially increases the number of verified sORFs in Drosophila. Of these, 128 were previously predicted sORFs but lacked experimental support, 22 are located in transcripts previously classified as lncRNAs, and 45 are novel sORFs found on transcripts not previously known to be transcribed. Further, among the sORFs that were previously annotated, we provide the first evidence of translation for sORFs with multiple isoforms. We tested the translational capability of randomly selected sORFs identified here in Drosophila S2R+ cell lines using an eGFP-tagged transfection assay, and found that most (22 out of 23) were highly translated, attesting to the validity of our combined experimental and bioinformatics approach. Thus, with this work, we provide the first comprehensive annotation of sORFs during early Drosophila embryogenesis, which we anticipate will aid our understanding of early development as well as the functions of sORFs in biological processes in general.2. Materials and methods2.1. Drosophila embryo collectionsEarly (0–4 h) Canton S embryos were collected from egg laying dishes. The embryos were then dechorionated by treatment with 50% bleach for 3–5 min and washed thoroughly with phosphate buffer solution (PBS buffer, pH7.4).41 The embryos were then transferred into Eppendorf tubes.2.2. Ribosome material preparationTo obtain the ribosome material, the dechorionated embryos were immediately incubated with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide in PBS for 5 min on ice, then the embryos were homogenized with a plastic pellet pestle in 100 µl of a mild ribosome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5 U/ml RNasin) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The nuclei and whole cells were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the lipid and other membranes were filtered out from the supernatant using a 100 µm sieve mesh. Finally, the cytosolic supernatant was loaded onto 20–50% continuous sucrose density gradients with the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT), followed by ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2.5 h in a SW41 rotor at 4°C (OptimaL-100 XP 2100 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman). Absorbance in each layer of the sucrose density gradient was measured at an optical density of 254 nm using the Piston Gradient Fractionater (BioComp). The RNA components and the amount of ribosomes were determined based on distinct peaks in the polysome profiling. Ribosome material was collected by pooling both the 80S (monosome) and the polysome peaks identified in the profile. The polysome profiling of the material treated with EDTA was obtained as above, except that the cytosolic supernatant was treated with 50 mM EDTA for 5 min on ice before loading onto the sucrose gradient.2.3. Strand-specific RNA-seq library constructionThe ribosome-associated RNA was extracted by adding an equal volume of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) to the ribosome material, followed by chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA concentration was quantified by Nanodrop2000 (Thermo Scientific) and the RNA quality was detected by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation). The method to purify poly-adenylated RNA of ribosome-associated RNA was optimized using the RiboMinus Eukaryote Kit for RNA-Seq (no. A10837-08, Ambion) to delete ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and Dynabeads oligo (dT)25 (no. 61002, Life Technologies) purification to select RNAs with poly-adenylated tails (Supplementary Fig. S1). The strand-specific RNA-seq library of the ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (A10837-08, Ambion). The library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation) to a depth of about 70 M reads per library.2.4. Preparation of total RNA and cytosolic RNATotal RNA was isolated by homogenization of dechorionated embryos, followed by the RNA extraction protocol with Trizol. The total RNA was then treated with DNase I to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. Cytosolic RNA was isolated from the supernatant of the embryo extract before loading onto sucrose gradient. The enrichment of both total RNA and cytosolic RNA for poly-adenylated RNAs was also performed using Dynabeads oligo (dT)25 purification. Both samples were sequenced as the ribosome-associated RNA above.2.5. Transcript assemblyThe ribosome-associated RNA, total RNA, and cytosolic RNA deep sequencing reads were each separately aligned using the TopHat v2.0.9 package.42 We used a built-in strategy of TopHat for a higher mapping rate. Raw data were first mapped to the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome (FlyBase r5.57 release) using the ‘-G’ parameter with other parameters set as default. The read pairs that were not completely mapped were then aligned to the D. melanogaster genome (dm3) for a second run. Only the uniquely aligned and concordant read pairs were used for further analysis. We used Cufflinks v2.2.1 with parameters set as default except using ‘-G’ parameter to assemble transcripts in the ribosome RNA, total RNA, and cytosolic RNA separately,43 and merged the three assembled gtf files and Flybase r5.57 annotation into a comprehensive transcriptome annotation, from which all further analysis was based. The raw read counts were normalized by the FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments) for each transcript based on the Flybase r5.57 gene models. The FPKM values were calculated using the Cufflinks v2.2.1 package with parameters set as default.2.6. Estimation of detectable level of transcriptionA machine learning algorithm described by Ramsköld et al.44 was first used to determine an optimal FPKM cutoff by comparing the expression levels of all annotated genes with that of randomly selected intergenic regions. The intergenic regions were at least 5 kb away from any annotated genes of FlyBase and the length distribution of the selected intergenic regions was the same as the distribution of the annotated exons to avoid a FPKM calculation bias. In this way, we identified a threshold FPKM value of 0.15 (Supplementary Fig. S2). To increase the confidence of the expression, we further required that the read counts be >20 reads. This value was determined based on an analysis of the annotated genes in our data of length between 0.2 and 0.6 kb, assuming that background reads for a gene would follow a geometric distribution.45 Small RNAs (shorter than 200 nt) were excluded because these were not efficiently captured and would be more likely resulting in assembly artifacts. For translation detection, we also required that the transcripts exhibit an expression level of = 0.15 FPKM and = 20 reads in our ribosome-associated RNA data.2.7. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionTotal RNA or ribosome RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNAs with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT)20VN primer. cDNAs were used to amplify the RNA targets by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the internal gene-specific primers and DNA Taq polymerase (no. DR100A, Takara).2.8. Evaluation of translational evidence for annotated sORFsWe considered as evidence of translation for a given annotated sORF as either: (i) the peptide fragment corresponding to the sORF was present in the most-recent proteomic screen (FlyBase r5.57 release); or (ii) the sORF was identified as a translated sORF in a previous ribosome profiling study in Drosophila S2 cells.462.9. Analysis of translated potential by PhyloCSFTo identify conserved translated sORFs, we utilized two annotated datasets to estimate the PhyloCSF threshold, comparing with 11 other Drosophila species: (i) the positive dataset was the annotated sORFs in FlyBase; and (ii) the negative dataset was all the sORFs contained in annotated lincRNAs based on the assumption that all of these sORFs are non-translated. From the histogram of the PhyloCSF score distribution in each set, we found an optimal PhyloCSF score of 50 which could discriminate annotated sORFs from untranslated sORFs (Supplementary Fig. S3). We then used the PhyloCSF package to evaluate the coding potential of ORFs contained in ribosome-associated lncRNAs and novel transcripts with parameters ‘12flies -orf = ATGStop –frames = 3 –minCodons = 10’, which was intended to find all ORFs longer than 10-aa in frame. To avoid any influence of annotated ORFs, we excluded the ORFs which overlapped with annotated ORFs in the same or opposite strand. The multi-alignment file of 12 flies species were downloaded from the Galaxy cloud tool.47–492.10. Identification of embryo specific sORFsFor the annotated sORFs, we compared them directly with the translated sORFs identified in the S2 cell line. Due to the lack information of sORFs in lncRNA and novel transcripts, we manually examined for the presence of at least one read in the S2 ribosome data mapped to the identified sORF regions.2.11. Calculation of arginine frequency of the identified sORFsWe calculated the arginine frequency by counting the number of arginines within all sORFs in each set. For the random control, we determined the expected frequencies of arginine based on that encoded from a random distribution of nucleotides.50 For this calculation we used, as observed frequencies of the four DNA bases in nature, as 0.22 of uracil, 0.303 of adenine, 0.217 of cytosine, and 0.261 of guanine.502.12. eGFP-tagged sORF constructionThe eGFP-tagged sORF vectors were based on the full-length cDNA of the corresponding sORFs. The full-length cDNAs were amplified by gene-specific full-length primers that introduced two different restriction enzyme digestion sites at the two ends. The cDNAs were then cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector, inserting an AvrII enzyme digestion site before the stop codon. The sequence of the eGFP coding regions (CDS) which did not contain start or stop codons of the CDS was amplified-tagged with AvrII digestion sites at the two ends. CDS sequences of eGFP were digested by AvrII and cloned into the AvrII linearized sORF vector in-frame. These eGFP-sORF sequences were excised by double restriction enzyme digestion and directionally cloned into pUAST.2.13. Transfections and immunoblottingS2R+ cells were grown in Schneider’s medium (no. 21720-024, Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (no. 16140-071, Gibco). S2R+ cells were transfected with reconstructed pUAST plasmid using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (no. 06366244001, Roche). After 48 h, proteins were extracted with RIPA Buffer (no. R0278, Sigma) containing protease inhibitor (no. 04693159001, Roche). The cell extract was then run in 12% Bis-Tris gels. Immunoblots were incubated with anti-GFP (1:1,000; no. M048-3, MBL) and then the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 680 donkey anti-mouse lgG (1:1,000; no. A10038, Life Technologies). Controls were incubated with anti-a-tubulin (1:1,000; no. PM054, MBL) and then secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit lgG (1:1000; no. A21076, Life Technologies).2.14. Localization of eGFP-fusion peptideAfter 48 hr post transfection, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and then mounted in antifade mountant with DAPI (no. P36962, Life Technologies). Imaging was acquired using a Nikon A1Si confocal microscope with a CFI Plan Fluor 40 × objective.3. Results and discussion3.1. Ultra-deep sequencing identifies an exhaustive set of ribosome-associated RNAsTo globally identify translated sORFs in the 0–4 h Drosophila embryos, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs isolated using density gradient velocity sedimentation (see Materials and methods) (Fig. 1A).41 Our ribosome profile revealed the presence of ribosomal subunits (40S and 60S) as well as monosomes (80S) and polysomes (Fig. 1B). To verify the identity of this ribosome material, prior to the sucrose gradient separation, we treated the embryo extract with 50 mM EDTA, which is known to dissociate intact ribosomes into their constituent subunits.51,52 As expected, this treatment completely eliminated the peaks of the intact ribosomes in the profile, while the peaks associated with the 40S and 60S subunits increased significantly (Fig. 1C). For our analysis, we collected not only polysomes as is typical with this approach but also monosomes as well, with which some short transcripts are only associated.53,54 Further, we purified only the poly-adenylated RNAs from this ribosome material, since non-poly-adenylated RNAs, a large proportion of the transcriptome, do not likely contain translated ORFs.55 The ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs were converted into cDNA libraries for strand-specific, paired-end 100 base-pair (bp) sequencing with HiSeq 2000.

To enable the calculation of ribosome association efficiency (see below), we also deep sequenced the poly-adenylated RNAs from the total RNA population from the 0-4 hr Drosophila embryos in a similar way as described for the ribosome-associated RNAs. We also deep sequenced the cytosolic RNA from this same embryonic sample to maximize the annotation of the translated transcripts (see ‘Materials and methods’ section). In total, 213.9 M paired-end aligned reads were obtained in the combined dataset, of which 91.7% were uniquely aligned to Dm3, nearly 10-fold higher in depth than previously obtained transcriptomic datasets of this stage.46,56,57 Following a procedure detailed in the Materials and methods, we finally identified 20,614 unique transcripts from 9,582 loci with high confidence in the 0–4 h Drosophila embryo (Supplementary Table S1). Comparing this with the latest release of the Drosophila transcriptome (FlyBase r5.57), we found that 18,613 transcripts (90.3%) are identical to the annotated transcripts, attesting to the high quality of our assembly. We further validated this assembly by randomly selecting a set of 18 of the novel transcripts using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and found that 17 transcripts are indeed detected in the 0–4 h embryo (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S3).From among the 20,614 unique transcripts identified in the combined dataset, we found that 17,166 from 8,803 loci are ribosome-associated (Supplementary Table S1). We directly compared the FPKM values for each transcript in the ribosome RNA data with the corresponding average intensities measured in a previous microarray study of 0–2 h embryos,41 and found a high degree of correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.76). These ribosome-associated transcripts thus represent a large fraction of the Drosophila transcriptome (83.3%). We classified these transcripts into three categories based on the annotation in FlyBase: protein-coding transcripts including novel variant isoforms (16,576), lncRNAs that also include novel variant isoforms (349), and assembled novel transcripts (241). We validated the ribosome association of 35 randomly selected transcripts in the latter two categories with RT-PCR, and found that 34 transcripts could indeed be detected in the 0–4 h embryo (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S3).3.2. Ribosome association provides translational evidence for annotated sORFsThe 16,576 ribosome-associated protein-coding transcripts correspond to 11,092 different ORFs, including 332 sORFs (Supplementary Table S2). Of the latter, inspection of FlyBase revealed that there was prior evidence of translation for only 204 annotated sORFs (Fig. 2A).46 Thus, our data provides the first necessary translational evidence for 128 annotated sORFs, substantially increasing the number of sORFs in Drosophila with evidence of translation. We note that the well-studied functional sORFs in Drosophila, tal and scl, were highly enriched in our ribosome-associated fraction (Fig. 2B), lending further confidence in the quality of our data.

For both the lncRNAs and the novel transcripts, there was a large fraction of the total number of expressed transcripts that were found to be associated to the ribosomes.Much of this previous translational evidence for the annotated sORFs was obtained from Drosophila S2 cells, which are derived from late stage embryos (20–24 h).46,58 Of the 332 sORFs in our data, 148 are not translated in the S2 cell line. Though cultured cells can exhibit phenotypes different from the original cells from which they are derived, these results indicate that a substantial fraction of the sORFs might be translated specifically during defined developmental stages. This comparison also suggests that a detailed characterization of the ribosome-associated RNAs at the other stages of development might uncover evidence for the translation of other sORFs.One advantage of our experimental approach is that we obtain the identity of the full-length of the ribosome-associated transcripts, enabling the detection of specific gene isoforms. Of the 332 different sORFs (corresponding to 313 genes), there were 17 genes with two different sORFs and 1 gene with three different sORFs. In addition, there were 177 genes with more than one annotated isoforms and 86 genes with variant isoforms not previously described. This is, in fact, the first detection of variant isoforms of translated sORFs. For example, with the gene CG40228, we found five isoforms with (in total) 3 different sORFs, including a variant isoform not previously characterized with a unique 5' untranslated region (UTR) that is 19 bp upstream of all other isoforms. Variant isoforms in longer ORFs are usually associated with their highly regulated, differential translation,59,60 and so this observation of variant sORF isoforms suggests that the translational processing of the sORFs may be as complex as that governing their longer counterpart. Ribosome profiling might prove useful in this regard, since a recent study employing this method thoroughly characterized stop codon readthrough in many genes in early Drosophila embryos.613.3. Ribosome-associated RNA sequencing identifies translated sORFs among the lncRNAsTranscripts that do not encode peptides and lack a 100-aa ORF are usually classified as lncRNAs.62,63 Although a number of these transcripts have been found to indeed function in a non-coding capacity,64–67 it remains to be determined whether at least some of these transcripts are misclassified and actually encode sORFs.20,68 In this regard, it is interesting that we have found 349 lncRNA transcripts associated with 264 genes that are associated to ribosomes, which corresponds to 76.9% of the expressed lncRNAs in these early embryos (Fig. 2C), an amount that is consistent with previous findings in different species.69We reasoned that if these lncRNAs actually encode for peptides, then they may be associated to ribosomes to a similar extent as established protein-coding genes. We thus evaluated the degree to which these lncRNAs and the protein-coding genes are associated with ribosomes compared with their total level of expression (their ‘ribosome association efficiency’). We found that, although these ribosome-associated lncRNAs are expressed at a much lower level than the protein-coding genes (Wilcoxon test, P–value < 2.2e-16) (Fig. 3A), their ribosome association efficiency is not significantly different from that of the protein-coding genes (Wilcoxon test, P–value > 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Thus, these apparently lncRNA transcripts are indeed associated to ribosomes to a similar extent as bona fide protein-coding transcripts.

(C) Overall, the length of ORFs contained within these lncRNAs and novel transcripts are, in general, shorter than the annotated sORFs.Although it is likely that many of these transcripts are indeed non-coding,70–72 we reasoned that at least some of these transcripts may encode sORFs and thus examined these transcripts with a bioinformatics approach for potential sORFs. In particular, we first identified ORFs with an ATG start codon and an in-frame stop codon, using the longest ORF for each stop codon. We then discarded those ORFs that encode for peptides smaller than 10-aa or that overlapped annotated ORFs in the same or opposite strand. In this way, we identified 1,784 putative sORFs (median length of 20-aa) and 9 potential long-ORFs in 347 out of the 349 ribosome-associated lncRNAs (Fig. 3C). As a stricter criterion, we examined the conservation at the amino-acid level of these putative sORFs using PhyloCSF, which has been demonstrated to be a highly effective method to identify sORFs.69,70 Using annotated sORFs and lincRNAs to establish rigorous threshold values in this approach (see ‘Materials and methods’ section), we identified 28 ORFs located in 21 ribosome-associated lncRNA genes as conserved translated ORFs. Of these, 22 are sORFs (Supplementary Table S2), including 3 that are poly-cistronic like tal and scl.5,16,17 We note that among these 22 novel sORFs, 64% are not found in the late-stage Drosophila S2 cell line, and thus may be specific for early embryos. The finding of a fair number of ribosome-associated lncRNAs that lack coding potential is intriguing and remains to be resolved. Based on the current understanding, one might speculate that they may play roles in RNA localization, RNA nonsense mediated decay, translational regulation, or they may produce non-canonical proteins that are quickly degraded.71–73 Alternatively, these lncRNAs may encode proteins with non-AUG start codons.74,75. However, one should also not exclude the possibility that a further analysis would yield functions that are not yet known.3.4. Ribosome-associated RNA sequencing identifies translated sORFs in novel transcriptsOf the 350 assembled novel transcripts identified in this study, 241 are associated with the ribosomes (Fig. 2D). Similar to the ribosome-associated lncRNAs, we found that these ribosome-associated novel transcripts are as tightly associated to the ribosomes as the protein-coding genes (Wilcoxon test, P-value > 0.05) (Fig. 3B), although their expression level is much lower than those known to encode for peptides (Wilcoxon test, P-value = 3.638e-12) (Fig. 3A). Examining these transcripts for potential ORFs similarly to the lncRNAs described above, we identified 2,521 putative ORFs, most of which (98.5%) were sORFs (median length of 24-aa) (Fig. 3C). Analysing these putative ORFs in terms of their conservation using PhyloCSF, we identified 66 different conserved translated ORFs contained within 32 of these novel transcripts (Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 45 are sORFs, most (87%) of which were present only in the early embryos and not in the S2 cell line.3.5. Translational validation of identified translated sORFsAs a low frequency of arginine occurrence is a common feature of proteins, and has been used as an indicator of the translational capacity of potential ORFs,46 we compared the arginine usage of our identified translated ORFs with that expected from the aa frequencies associated with randomly distributed nucleotides.50 We indeed found that, like the annotated sORFs, the novel translated ORFs in both the previously identified lncRNAs and in the novel transcripts exhibit a much lower usage of arginine than this random distribution, consistent with the notion that these are indeed translatable sORFs (Fig. 4A).

(B) Schematic of the transfection construct of the eGFP-tagged sORFs. (C–E) Translational validation of CG34136, CR44101 and pncr004:X. For each of the fusions, the number of reads in the ribosome-associated RNA data of the corresponding sORF is shown in the left panel, whereas a typical image from fluorescence microscopy (DAPI: DNA; eGFP: translated sORF) and the results from the Western blot are presented in the middle and right panels, respectively. In each Western DNA, the upper panel is the a-tubulin control detected with an anti-a-tubulin antibody and the molecular weight standard corresponds to 49 kDa. The lower panel in each Western blot is the fused-sORF detected with anti-eGFP and the molecular weight standards refer to 38 kDa (top) and 28 kDa (bottom). The expected molecular weights of the sORFs are 36.6, 30.8, and 30.3 kDa, respectively. Scale bar: 2.5 µm.To provide additional support for this translational capacity, we examined the ability of 23 randomly selected sORFs, including 15 annotated sORFs without evidence for translation, 4 sORFs in lncRNAs, and 4 sORFs in novel transcripts, to be translated in Drosophila S2R+ cells (Supplementary Table S3). We generated eGFP-fusion vectors that contained all of the translation-related elements of the sORF, including the 5'UTR and 3'UTR, together with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) coding sequence (CDS) in-frame following the sORF (Fig. 4B). Thus, translation of this eGFP-tagged sORF would produce an eGFP-fusion protein, for which we examined using Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. Overall, we found that 22 of the 23 candidates were well translated (Fig. 4C–E and Supplementary Fig. S6). Of these, 3 were clearly localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm as observed with eGFP control (Supplementary Fig. S6), while the other 19 were mainly localized in cytoplasm (Fig. 4C–E and Supplementary Fig. S6). Of note though, the cytoplasmic localization did not appear to be the same for all of the fusions, with some enriched in a single, large subsection of the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S6d, e, h, i, s), others with a more punctate distribution scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S6c, f, g, o), and others with a more uniform distribution within the cytoplasm except for punctate locations (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S6f, l, m, n, p, q, t, u). Such a wide range of localizations is thus likely owing to the sORF-encoded peptide and not the eGFP, since the latter is present in all of the fusions (Supplementary Fig. S6b). Taken together, these results indicate that most of the identified translated sORFs could indeed be translated into peptides in vivo.4. ConclusionIn this study, we provide the first genome-wide annotation of the translated sORFs population that is present during the very early stages of Drosophila embryogenesis, thus setting the stage for detailed characterizations of their functions during this fundamental biological process. The 399 sORFs identified here significantly expands the population of known sORFs in this model organism, which we anticipate will aid in future bioinformatics approaches for de novo predictions of sORFs both in Drosophila, as well as in much less well studied organisms, such as humans.10,76 Determining if their translation is indeed as complex as the longer ORFs, or if they form and evolve by mechanisms distinct from their longer counterparts, or indeed if their spectrums of biological functions are as diverse as the longer ORFs will be fascinating to now resolve.5.

IntroductionIn the early 20th century, rapid development in the chemical industry led to the production and wide use of numerous anthropogenic chemicals. Because they are often recalcitrant in the environment and toxic to humans and ecosystems, they have caused serious environmental problems.1–3 Many bacterial strains capable of degrading man-made xenobiotic compounds have been isolated and characterized.4–9 Such strains are thought to have evolved to degrade xenobiotics within relatively short periods. However, with the exception of a few speculative examples, the evolutionary processes of these bacterial strains remain largely unknown.5,10–13 <U+03B3>-Hexachlorocyclohexane (<U+03B3>-HCH; also known as <U+03B3>-BHC or lindane) is a completely man-made chlorinated pesticide that has caused serious environmental problems due to its toxicity and long persistence in upland soils.7,14,15 Only 60 years after the first release of <U+03B3>-HCH into the environment, a number of bacterial strains that aerobically degrade <U+03B3>-HCH have been isolated from geographically distant locations around the world.7 An archetypal <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading strain, Sphingobium japonicum UT26, was isolated from an upland experimental field to which <U+03B3>-HCH had been applied once a year for 12 years, and its aerobic <U+03B3>-HCH degradation pathway (Fig. 1) and genome organization have been intensively studied.16–19 Recently, many draft genome sequences of other HCH (including not only <U+03B3>-HCH but also other HCH isomers) degraders and their related but non-HCH-degrading strains were determined, and their comparative analyses have been published.20,21 These studies provided us some important primary information on the evolution of HCH-degraders with the involvement of plasmids and insertion sequences (ISs). However, the more detailed information (e.g. which and how plasmids/ISs are involved in the evolution of HCH-degraders) remains unclear.

MM-1,22,23,Sphingobium sp. MI1205,24,25 and Sphingobium sp. TKS,26 were determined. On the basis of our comparison of the complete genome sequences of these three strains and UT26, in association with several supporting experimental data, the evolution of <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading bacterial strains is discussed.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditionsStrains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. All sphingomonad (the collective name of Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Sphingopyxis, and their related genera) 27 strains were cultured at 30°C in 1/3LB medium or 1/10W minimal medium.24 If needed, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: tetracycline (Tc) 20 µg/ml, nalidixic acid (Nal) 100 µg/ml, and kanamycin (Km) 50 µg/ml for UT26; Tc 5 µg/ml, Nal 100 µg/ml, gentamycin (Gm) 2 µg/ml, and Km 50 µg/ml for MM-1; Tc 2 µg/ml, Nal 100 µg/ml, and Km 50 µg/ml for TKS; and Tc 2 µg/ml, Nal 100 µg/ml, and Km 50 µg/ml for MI1205. Escherichia coli DH5a for genetic manipulation was grown at 37°C in LB.28 If needed, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: Tc 20 µg/ml, Gm 20 µg/ml, and Km 50 µg/ml. The solid media were prepared by the addition of 1.5% agar.2.2. Construction of plasmids and strainsThe 3.6-kb region containing the MM-1 linKbLbMbNb genes was amplified by PCR using the primer set of MM_linKLMN_F and MM_linKLMN_R (Supplementary Table S2), and the amplified fragment was cloned into a broad-host-range vector, pKS13P,29 under the linA constitutive promoter30 to generate pKSR1020. The whole region of the linFb gene of strain TKS was amplified by PCR using the primer set of TKS_MAR_F_Hind and TKS_MAR_R_Bam (Supplementary Table S2), digested with BamHI and HindIII, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBBR1-MCS231 to generate pBLFb. To disrupt the genomic linFb gene in TKS, an internal part of linFb was amplified by PCR using the primer set of TKS_MAR_single_F_Eco and TKS_MAR_single_R_Hind (Supplementary Table S2), digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEX18Gm.32 The resultant plasmid pEDLFb was introduced into TKS by electroporation to select the Gm-resistant transformants. Subsequent PCR analysis of one such transformant (TKSdLFb) confirmed that its genomic linFb gene was disrupted by reciprocal homologous recombination through the single crossover-mediated integration of pEDLFb (Supplementary Fig. S1).2.3. DNA manipulations and Sanger sequencingEstablished methods were employed for the preparation of plasmids and genomic DNAs, their digestion with restriction endonucleases, ligation, and agarose gel electrophoresis, and the transformation of E. coli cells.28,33 Electroporation of sphingomonad strains was performed as described previously.34 PCR for cloning was performed with KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The Sanger sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 3130xl sequencer and ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Kit (Applied Biosystems).2.4. Genome sequencing and annotation analysesFragment reads of genomic DNA of MM-1, MI1205, and TKS were obtained by the Roche 454 and Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing systems, and were assembled using the Newbler programme (Roche). The GenoFinisher and AceFileViewer programmes were used to finish the sequencing completion.35 More detailed information for these procedures have been published elsewhere.23,25,26 Sequencing gap regions were amplified by PCR using KOD FX (TOYOBO) or Ex Taq (TaKaRa) by using the total DNA of the respective strains as templates, and the resultant DNA fragments were sequenced using primers for PCR amplification. Pulsed-field-gel electrophoresis was also performed as described previously36 to support the whole genome sequencing data of MI1205 and TKS (data not shown). The annotation data of the complete genome sequences were obtained by PGAAP (Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/; 22 August 2016, date last accessed), and was curated with the dedicated software bundled in the GenomeMatcher programme (http://www.ige.tohoku.ac.jp/joho/gmProject/gmhome.html; 22 August 2016, date last accessed)37 as well as by consulting the MiGAP auto-annotation system (Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline, http://www.migap.org/; 22 August 2016, date last accessed).2.5. Computational analyses of sequence dataThe nucleotide and protein sequences were analysed using the Genetyx programme version 13–18 (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Homology searches were performed using the BLAST programmes available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/; 22 August 2016, date last accessed) with the default parameters. Venn diagram was depicted using the result obtained by BLASTClust analysis (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/; 22 August 2016, date last accessed)38 for all predicted open reading frames (ORFs) of the four <U+03B3>-HCH degraders with a parameter set ‘-p T -L .6 -b T -S 60 -a 24’. Comparative analyses of DNA sequences were performed by GenomeMatcher using BLASTN with a parameter set ‘-F F -W 21 -e 0.01’. Conserved motifs and repeat sequences were searched by GenomeMatcher. All neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees shown in this study were constructed using MAFFT programme (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/; 22 August 2016, date last accessed)39 and visualized by NJplot software (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/njplot.html; 22 August 2016, date last accessed).40 Transposable elements were identified by analyses of regions containing putative transposase genes, i.e. mutual BLASTN analysis with a parameter set ‘-F F -W 21 -e 0.01’and searches for inverted and direct repeats using Dot Match mode of GenomeMatcher. For detection of candidate ORFs relevant to metabolisms of aromatic compounds, all ORFs obtained from each genome were BLASTP-searched with parameters ‘-e 1e-5 -b 5 -F F’ and threshold identity =50%, query and reference sequence coverage =50% against an in-house database for the enzymes for degradation of aromatic compounds.412.6. Entrapment of transposable elementspGEN500, an entrapment plasmid vector of transposable elements,42 was introduced into UT26, MM-1, TKS, and MI1205 by electroporation or mating using E. coli S17-1, and the cells carrying pGEN500 were selected on the 1/3LB agar plate containing Tc. The pGEN500-containing strains were thereafter plated on 1/3LB agar containing Tc and 10% sucrose (w/v) at 30°C. The colonies formed on the plates were analysed for their resident pGEN500 derivatives. Such derivatives with enlarged sizes were postulated to be formed by the insertion of endogenous transposable elements in the sacB gene on pGEN500. The insertion event in each derivative was investigated by PCR using the multiple pairs of primers listed in Supplementary Table S2, and the insert was sequenced by the Sanger method.3. Results and discussion3.1. Complete genome sequences of three <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strainsMost of the aerobic <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading bacterial strains that have been critically analysed at the genetic level are sphingomonads that belong to Alphaproteobacteria.7 We have previously published an article describing our detailed analysis of the UT26 genome.18 In this study, the complete genome sequences of three other <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading strains, Sphingomonas sp. MM-1,22,23,Sphingobium sp. MI1205,24,25 and Sphingobium sp. TKS,26 were determined.The basic genome organizations of the four <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading strains isolated from different geographical areas are summarized in Table 1. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that these four <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading strains are phylogenetically diverse among related sphingomonad strains (Fig. 2). All predicted ORFs of these four strains (19,312) were clustered into 10,325 ORF clusters. Figure 3 summarizes the result as a Venn diagram that shows the numbers of shared and unique ORF clusters among the four strains; these four strains each have 1,190–2,346 unique ORF clusters, but share only 1,288 ones. This observation supports the phylogenetic divergence of the four <U+03B3>-HCH degraders. These results also strongly suggest that the four degraders independently acquired <U+03B3>-HCH-degradation ability, and thus it is unlikely that the four strains have been derived from one ancestral <U+03B3>-HCH-degrader.

Similarly, several putative genes for the degradation of aromatic compounds were found in the MM-1, MI1205, and TKS genomes (Supplementary Table S3). The potential of the four <U+03B3>-HCH degraders for the degradation of aromatic compounds was estimated more comprehensively by BLASTP search of all their ORFs against our previously constructed in-house database which consists of enzymes for the degradation of aromatic compounds,41 and the result was summarized in Supplementary Table S4. The numbers of ORFs potentially involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds in the four strains (62, 46, 27, and 25 for TKS, UT26, MI1205, and MM-1, respectively) are much smaller than those in versatile recalcitrant pollutant degraders, Cupriavidus necator JMP134,43,44 and Burkholderia xenovorans LB40045,46 (149 and 135 for JMP134 and LB400, respectively). Especially, those in UT26, MI1205, and MM-1 are even smaller than those in typical metabolically versatile soil bacterial strains Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 1761647–50 and Pseudomonas putida KT244051 (73 and 62 for KT2440 and ATCC 17616, respectively). These results indicate that our sphingomonad strains are ‘specialists’ for <U+03B3>-HCH degradation, but not ‘generalists’ for the degradation of many recalcitrant compounds.3.2. The lin genes for <U+03B3>-HCH utilizationUT26 converts <U+03B3>-HCH to ß-ketoadipate via reactions catalysed by dehydrochlorinase (LinA), haloalkane dehalogenase (LinB), dehydrogenase (LinC), reductive dechlorinase (LinD), ring-cleavage dioxygenase (LinE), and maleylacetate reductase (MAR) (LinF); ß-ketoadipate is thereafter converted to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA by succinyl-CoA:3-oxoadipate CoA transferase (LinGH) and ß-ketoadipyl CoA thiolase (LinJ), respectively (Fig. 1).16,18 In addition to genes for these catabolic enzymes and their regulatory genes (linR for linDE and linI for linGHJ),18,52 the linKLMN genes encoding a putative ABC-transporter system are necessary for the <U+03B3>-HCH utilization in UT26.29 The linA, linB, linC, and linF genes, and the linRED, linGHIJ, and linKLMN clusters are dispersed on the UT26 genome.18 Since the ß-ketoadipate pathway is often used by environmental bacterial strains,53 the lin genes for the conversion of <U+03B3>-HCH to ß-ketoadipate (linA to linF) are peculiar to the <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading pathway. In particular, the linA gene is unique because it does not show significant similarity to any sequences in the databases except for the almost identical (>90% identity) linA genes from other bacterial strains and metagenomes.7,16The MM-1, MI1205, and TKS genomes carry linA, linB, and linC genes and a linRED cluster that are almost identical (>98% identity at the DNA level) to those of UT26 (Table 2). The former two strains additionally carry a linF gene and linGHIJ cluster that are almost identical (>98% identity at the DNA level) to those in UT26, strongly suggesting that <U+03B3>-HCH is degraded in these two strains by the same pathway as in UT26 (Fig. 1). The last strain lacks the linFUT26 and linGHIJUT26 cluster for maleylacetate metabolism (Fig. 1). Although two copies of the truncated version of linF (named linF') (Supplementary Fig. S2) are present in the TKS genome, linF' was assumed not to encode functional MAR, since linF' misses more than one half of the intact linF gene (Supplementary Fig. S2). TKS instead carries another putative gene, designated linFb, on Chr1. Although LinFb showed only 49% identity to LinFUT26 (Table 2), it showed much higher similarity with other known MAR proteins, such as TfdF from Bordetella petrii,54,Achromobacter denifrificans,55,Burkholderia sp. M701 (Acc no. YP_008864525), and Comamonas testosteroni56 (83,78, 78, and 71%, respectively). Interestingly, Sphingobium sp. HDIPO4, a recently isolated HCH degrader, has the identical linFb gene, although its start codon is annotated at a position different from that in TKS. 57 To clarify the LinFb function, its gene in TKS was disrupted (Supplementary Fig. S1). The resultant strain did not grow on a minimal agar plate supplemented with <U+03B3>-HCH as a sole source of carbon and energy, and this growth defect was reversed by the supply of the intact linFb gene (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, the <U+03B3>-HCH utilization defect of UT1023d, a linF mutant of UT26,34 was reversed by the supply of the linFb gene (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrated that the linFb encodes a MAR that is functional for the <U+03B3>-HCH utilization. Although the linGHIJUT26 cluster was not found in the TKS genome, many homologues of linG, linH, and linJ were found (Supplementary Table S5). Among these homologues, one set of linGH homologues is located just downstream of linFb on Chr1TKS (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and only one set of linGHIJ homologues exists as a cluster on Chr2TKS (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Some of these homologues may be functional for the ß-ketoadipate metabolism, and this experimental confirmation is necessary. These results strongly suggested that <U+03B3>-HCH is also degraded in TKS by the same pathway as in UT26 (Fig. 1). lin genes of four <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strainsac, encoding on complementary strand.blinF' and linF"""" are probably pseudogenes.clinEb is homologue of PcpA (96% identity) and partially involved in <U+03B3>-HCH degradation in UT26.34lin genes of four <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strainsac, encoding on complementary strand.blinF' and linF"""" are probably pseudogenes.clinEb is homologue of PcpA (96% identity) and partially involved in <U+03B3>-HCH degradation in UT26.34The linKLMNUT26 homologues have been found in various bacterial strains16,29 and were also found in the MM-1, MI1205, and TKS genomes (Table 2). However, their similarities to linKLMNUT26 are lower (<93% identity at DNA level; Table 2) than in the case of the other lin genes mentioned earlier, and this divergence roughly reflects the phylogenetic relationship of their hosts (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that the linKLMN system is one of the inherent functions necessary for <U+03B3>-HCH utilization in sphingomonads. In particular, the linKLMN homologues of MM-1, which is phylogenetically the most distant strain from UT26 (Fig. 2), show a relatively low similarity with linKLMNUT26 (42–75% identities at the amino acid level; Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5), and they were designated linKbLbMbNb. To confirm their function for <U+03B3>-HCH utilization, we attempted to disrupt the linKbLbMbNb gene cluster in MM-1. However, such an expected disruptant could not be constructed because unknown DNA rearrangements often occurred in MM-1. As an alternative confirmation, a plasmid containing the linKbLbMbNbMM-1 gene cluster was introduced into RE1, a linKLMNUT26 disruptant of UT26.29 The growth of RE1 in 1/3LB medium was inhibited by the addition of <U+03B3>-HCH (Supplementary Fig. S6A),29 and this inhibition was suppressed by the supply of the linKbLbMbNb cluster (Supplementary Fig. S6B) as well as the linKLMNUT26 one (Supplementary Fig. S6C),29 strongly suggesting that the both clusters function in the same way for the <U+03B3>-HCH utilization. These results supported our hypothesis that the linKLMN system is one of the inherent functions necessary for <U+03B3>-HCH utilization in sphingomonads. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that other functional homologue(s) of linKLMN system exist in MM-1.All of the four strains carry almost identical linA to linE genes (designated ‘specific’ lin genes) (Table 2), suggesting they acquired such genes by lateral gene transfer. However, the specific lin genes are dispersed on multiple replicons in the four strains (Table 2). In UT26, linA to linC are located on Chr1, and only the linRED cluster is located on a plasmid. On the other hands, all the specific lin genes are dispersed on multiple plasmids with various combinations in other three strains, although additional copies of linB and linC are also located on Chr1 in TKS (Table 1). Furthermore, replicon types of such plasmids carrying the specific lin genes are various (Table 3). These observations indicate that these four strains did not simply acquire all the specific lin genes at once as a cluster. This contrasts with other aromatic compound-degrading strains, which can acquire a whole set of responsible genes by the conjugative transfer of plasmids and/or integrative and conjugative elements.58–60Classification of sphingomonad plasmids and plasmid-type repliconsaThe representative replicons of each type ones are indicated in bold in the first column.bReplicons having more than one rep genes.cStart codon is differently annotated for the same DNA region.dIdentical with each other.Classification of sphingomonad plasmids and plasmid-type repliconsaThe representative replicons of each type ones are indicated in bold in the first column.bReplicons having more than one rep genes.cStart codon is differently annotated for the same DNA region.dIdentical with each other.Although, in the present study, we only described the overall genetic repertoire of the lin genes for <U+03B3>-HCH utilization, the composition of genes for LinA and LinB variants and their copy numbers and expression levels are important for the degradation performance of host strains toward HCH isomers, since the LinA and LinB variants show different levels of enzymatic activity toward different HCH isomers and their metabolites.7,16,61–64 However, in order to properly discuss this point from a genomic viewpoint, additional fundamental biochemical and experimental data will be needed.3.3. Replication/partition-encoding regions of plasmids and plasmid-type replicons in sphingomonad strainsThe putative replication origins (oriCs) of the main chromosomes (Chr1s) of TKS, MI1205, and MM-1 were, as in the case with Chr1UT26,18 found to be of alphaproteobacterial-chromosome type;65,66 these oriCs were located upstream of the uroprophyrinogen decarboxylase gene (hemE) with multiple DnaA boxes [TT(A/T)TNCACA] (Supplementary Fig. S7).67 On the other hand, as in the case of Chr2UT26, both Chr2TKS and Chr2MI1205 have the plasmid-type replication and active partition systems.18 These three plasmid-type chromosomes and the 21 plasmids in our four strains and the plasmids from other sphingomonads were, on the basis of the similarities of their RepA (DNA replication initiator) proteins, classified into 13 types (Table 3). Although the importance of plasmids in sphingomonads has been recognized,8 no detailed analysis of their fundamental machineries was reported. In addition, RepA proteins of plasmids in sphingomonads show a very low level of similarity to those of well-studied plasmids (e.g. IncP-1, F, IincP-7, and IncP-9 plasmids), and thus we compared only plasmids in sphingomonads in this study. Since the RepA proteins of the 13 types are very divergent, they were further categorized into three major groups, in each of which the RepA proteins exhibit 22–60% identity: (i) the Chr2UT26- and pCHQ1-types (Fig. 4A), (ii) the pUT1-, pISP3-, pTK3_1-, and pTK3_2-types (Fig. 4B), and (iii) the pISP4-, pTK2-, pTK7-, and pTK8-types (Fig. 4C). Based on our BLASTP analysis, the RepA proteins of pNL1, pLB1, and pUT2 did not show similarity to those of any of the other types of plasmids listed in Table 3, although the RepA of pUT2 was similar to those of the IncP-9 family of plasmids.18,Figure 4D schematically shows the organizations of the repA-flanking regions in the 12 representative plasmids (note that pTK3 has three types of repA genes), and many of these regions also carry the putative replication origin (oriV) sequences as well as the putative genes for the active partition systems, each with the putative parS (cis-acting centromeric) sequences, the parB gene encoding the parS-binding protein, and the parA gene encoding the NTPase that is capable of binding the parS-ParB complex.68 The Chr2UT26- and pCHQ1-type plasmids belong to the repABC-type plasmids,69 and putative palindromic parS sequences were found (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Table S6). The Chr2UT26-type plasmids have the parA-parB-repA cluster, and the order of these three genes is conserved in other typical repABC-type plasmids,69 although the RepA proteins from the Chr2UT26-type plasmids are divergent in their sizes and similarities (Table 3 and Fig. 4A). In contrast, the pCHQ1-type plasmids have a repA-parA-parB cluster (Fig. 4D) with nearly identical RepA proteins (Table 3). Other types of plasmids except the pLB1-type were categorized as iteron-type plasmids (Table 3),70,71 and direct repeats (iteron), DnaA box, and parS sequences were found in their repA-flanking regions (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Table S6). Each of the pISP1, Chr1TKS, pTK1, pTK3, pTK4, pMI2, pMI3, and pMI4 replicons appears to carry at least two repA genes, which are of different types (Tables 1 and 3). This observation suggested the frequent occurrence of fusions of ancestral plasmids (see below). Similar mosaic replicons carrying more than one repA gene have been reported in various bacterial strains.72 Interestingly, six pISP4-type plasmids carry identical repA and parA genes, and five of them also have other types of repA genes (Table 3), suggesting a prevalent fusion event of replicons in the pISP4-type plasmids (see below). It is noteworthy that all six pISP4-type plasmids contain the lin genes (Table 3), indicating that this type of plasmid plays an important role in dissemination of the lin genes.

Highly conserved regions of replicons in sphingomonad strainsAlthough multiple members in each of the pCHQ1-, pUT1-, pLB1-, pISP3-, pUT2-, and pISP4-type plasmids have almost identical repA-containing regions, the sizes and gene contents of the plasmid members in each type are diverse (Table 3). Therefore, we compared the overall structures in the six types of plasmids (Fig. 5). The 6.4-kb repA-parA-parB-containing region and the 10-kb repA-parA-containing region are conserved in all members of the pCHQ1- and pUT1-type plasmids, respectively (Fig. 5AB). The 25.5-kb region containing the pLB1-type repA and parB genes is conserved in pMI3 and pTK5 (Fig. 5C). Most of this region is also conserved in pLA2, although the region is divided into two parts and the parB gene is lacking (Fig. 5C). pMI3 is a fusion plasmid of the pLB1- and pISP4-type plasmids because the 9.1-kb repA-parA-containing region commonly conserved in the pISP4-type plasmids (Fig. 5F) is, together with the linC- and linF""-containing region, inserted into the continuous region on pLB1 (Fig. 5C). A part of the 9.1-kb conserved region is also present in pTK4 (Fig. 5B). The 4.5-kb region containing the pISP3-type repA and parA genes is conserved in pTK6 and pMI4 (Fig. 5D). Two 1,645-bp plasmids, pUT2 and pTK9, differ by only 9 bp (Fig. 5E). As mentioned above, all the pISP4-type plasmids except for archetypal pISP4 have, in addition to the common repA gene, other distinct repA genes (Table 3), and probably are fusion plasmids. IS6100 or the Tn3-type transposon is located at the junctions of highly conserved regions of pISP4-type plasmids (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the pISP4-type plasmids are easily fused with other replicons via the transposition of IS6100 and/or the Tn3-type transposon. The repA, parA, and parB genes of the Chr2UT26-type replication machineries were also located on Chr1TKS, pISP1, pMI2, Chr2TKS, pTK1, Chr2MI1205, and pMI1 (Table 3), and the former three replicons carry an almost identical 20.3-kb region that covers the Chr2UT26-type repA, parA, and parB genes (Supplementary Fig. S8). Our findings in this section clearly indicate that the replicons having highly conserved replication/partition genes are distributed among sphingomonad strains with frequent recombination events including replicon fusion.

Genes for conjugal transfer of plasmids in HCH-degrading sphingomonadsThe genes for conjugal transfer consist of those encoding proteins involved in mating pair formation (Mpf) and DNA transfer and replication (Dtr).73 The mpf genes encode proteins that assemble in a large macromolecular structure called the Type IV secretion system (T4SS), whereas the dtr genes encode proteins that bind to the DNA at the origin of transfer region, oriT, forming a structure called a relaxosome. This modular gene organization is shared by most conjugative systems, showing a high degree of gene synteny conservation. Among the sphingomonad plasmids listed in Table 3, conjugal transferability of pCHQ1 and pLB1 has been experimentally confirmed,36,74 and these two plasmids have putative gene clusters for conjugal transfer similar to the vir gene cluster of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid, consisting of genes for Mpf (VirB1 to VirB11) and Dtr (relaxase VirD2 and coupling protein VirD4)( Supplementary Fig. S9A). 17,74 Putative vir gene clusters were also found on pISP0, pTK1, pTK2, pTK5, and pMI3 (Supplementary Fig. S9A), indicating the potential self-transferability of these plasmids. However, the level of similarity of each component to the counterpart of Ti plasmid is relatively low, and only the phylogenetic relationship of the putative cytoplasmic ATPase component (VirB4), which is the essential and most conserved component of T4SS,73 encoded by these clusters is shown (Supplementary Fig. S9B). pCHQ1 has another putative gene cluster for conjugal transfer similar to the tra gene cluster of F plasmid,75 and gene clusters similar to the tra gene cluster were also found on Chr1TKS, pMI1, pMI2, pTK1, and pISP1 (Supplementary Fig. S9C). As in the case with the gene clusters homologous to the vir gene cluster, the level of similarity of each component to its counterpart in F plasmid is relatively low, and only phylogenetic relationship of cytoplasmic ATPase component (TraC: VirB4 homologue in function) encoded by these clusters is shown (Supplementary Fig. S9D). However, traI and traD, which encode the relaxase and coupling protein, respectively, were not found on pCHQ1, and traD and traG, which encode the coupling protein and inner membrane platform component, respectively, are missing on pISP1 (Supplementary Fig. S9C). Further experimental confirmation is necessary to demonstrate the self-transferability of these plasmids having putative gene clusters for conjugal transfer.3.6. Transposable elements in four <U+03B3>-HCH degradersMany putative transposable elements including IS elements and Tn3-type transposons were found in the genomes of the four <U+03B3>-HCH degraders (Supplementary Table S7).18 Although most of the IS elements are present as a single-copy form in the four strains (Supplementary Table S7), IS6100 is, as in the case of UT26, the most abundant element in the MM-1, TKS, and MI1205 genomes (15, 29, and 24 copies, respectively) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S7). This suggests that IS6100 can transpose and increase its copy number in these <U+03B3>-HCH degraders. To investigate the transposition activity of IS6100 and other transposable elements, the IS entrapment methodology using pGEN50042 was applied for the four <U+03B3>-HCH degraders. We conducted several independent analyses for each strain, and detected the successful transposition of IS6100, ISsp1, ISSj02, ISSj12, and Tn6134 in UT26, IS6100, ISSj02, ISTks12, Tn6268, and Tn6269 in TKS, and IS6100, ISsp1, ISMi02, ISMi08, Tn6137, and Tn6274 in MI1205 (Supplementary Table S7). On the other hand, this IS-entrapment system did not work well in MM-1 because of the high-frequency generation of the spontaneous sucrose-resistant mutants without the insertion of transposable elements into the sacB gene on pGEN500 (data not shown).3.7. Inference of the past genome rearrangements via IS6100IS6100 is often located in close proximity to the lin genes in the HCH-degrading strains and the metagenomic sequences from HCH-contaminated sites.76,77 IS6100 with a size of 880 bp is a ‘replicative’ IS element (Supplementary Fig. S10),78 and its transposition without apparent preference of target specificity causes the duplication of IS6100 with an 8-bp duplication of the target sequence. Therefore, the IS6100 transposition can generate three types of DNA rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S11): intra-molecular transposition with a deletion/resolution (intra-replicon 1) or inversion (intra-replicon 2) event, and inter-molecular transposition with a fusion (inter-replicon) event. Our comparison of the regions just upstream and downstream of the 13 copies of IS6100 present on Chr1, Chr2, pCHQ1, and pUT1 of UT26 revealed five pairs of 8-bp sequences (Supplementary Table S8). On the basis of the IS6100 transposition mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S11), the most plausible past events caused by transposition of IS6100 can be inferred (Fig. 6A); it is indicated that not only simple transposition with inversion but also transposition accompanied with the fusion and resolution of replicons must have occurred. In a similar manner, seven, one, and four pairs of 8-bp sequences were found just upstream or downstream of IS6100 in TKS, MM-1, and MI1205, respectively (Supplementary Table S8), and the plausible past events mediated by transposition of IS6100 in these strains are depicted in Figure 6B–D.

Not only the lin genes themselves (Table 2) but also their flanking regions are highly conserved (Fig. 7). Interestingly, such conserved regions are located very close to IS6100 and the distances between the IS6100 copies and the lin genes are varied (Fig. 7). This means that IS6100 is likely to play a crucial ‘editing’ role in the ‘trimming’ of ‘unnecessary regions’ for HCH utilization and the ‘gathering’ of the specific lin genes. At least, it is the most plausible that the transposition of IS6100 led to the diversification of the distribution and organization of the lin genes in the genomes. The distance between IS6100 and linA is the longest in UT26 (Fig. 7A), and the linB gene in UT26 has no IS6100 element in its flanking regions (Fig. 7B). Moreover, IS6100 is located at only one side of linC (Fig. 7C) and the linRED cluster (Fig. 7D) in UT26. These results suggested that UT26 is the closest to the prototype of the <U+03B3>-HCH degrader, at least among the four strains examined in this study.

Conclusions and perspectivesOur comparison of the complete genome sequences of four <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading sphingomonad strains and gathering of experimental data in this study demonstrate or strongly suggest the following points: (i) the gene repertoires and genomic organizations of the four <U+03B3>-HCH-degrading strains, which are phylogenetically dispersed among related sphingomonad strains (Fig. 2), are relatively different from one another (Table 1 and Fig. 3); (ii) all four strains carry almost identical linA to linE genes for the conversion of <U+03B3>-HCH to maleylacetate (Fig. 1 and Table 2); (iii) considerably different genes are used for the metabolism of maleylacetate in TKS (Fig. 1, Table 2, and Supplementary Table S5); (iv) the linKLMN genes for the putative ABC transporter necessary for <U+03B3>-HCH utilization are structurally divergent, and such divergence reflects the phylogenetic relationship of their hosts (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table 2); (v) most of the linA to linJ genes for the catabolic enzymes are located on several replicons whose replication/partition systems are highly conserved among sphingomonad plasmids (Tables 1 and 3); and (vi) the transposition of IS6100 has caused dynamic genome rearrangements including the fusion and resolution of replicons and the diversification of lin-flanking regions in the four strains (Figs. 6 and 7).Based on our results in this study, we propose that these <U+03B3>-HCH-degraders were formed independently in different geographic regions through the recruitment of specific lin genes and genes for the metabolism of maleylacetate into ancestral strains that had the core functions (including the linKLMN-encoded one) of sphingomonads. Multiple plasmids whose replication/partition machineries are highly conserved in sphingomonads might have played important roles in the recruitment of the specific lin genes by their horizontal transfer. In addition, IS6100 likely plays a crucial ‘editing’ role in the distribution and organization of the lin genes in genomes. In the future, our hypothesis may be confirmed in experiments using the four HCH degraders and their related but non-HCH-degrading and/or IS6100-free sphingomonad strains.4.
