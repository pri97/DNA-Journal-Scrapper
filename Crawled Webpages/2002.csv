Target sequences examined are as follows: (i) short repeat: Crossover hot-spot instigator (Chi) sequence, replication termination ( Ter ) sequence, and DnaA binding sequence (DnaA box); (ii) potential stem-loop structure repeats: palindromic unit (PU), boxC sequences, and intergenic repeat unit (IRU); (iii) potential RNA coding repeats: rRNAs, PAIR, TRIP, and QUAD; and (iv) potential protein coding repeats: insertion elements (ISs) and Long Direct Repeats (LDRs). We also examined the distribution of these sequences on leading and lagging strands. We obtained another four statistically significant LDR sequences with more than 187 bp matched to LDR-A near the LDR loci, suggesting that these regions might be used as high recombination hot spots for LDR. Adaptation of individual LDRs to E. coli genome is also discussed on the basis of codon usage.

Analysis of 3477 segregants using several PCR-based marker technologies, including cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence, derived-CAPS, and single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed 1 ORF in a 6-kb candidate interval. Normal-type rice cultivars have an identical sequence in this region, consisting of 3 exons (558, 318, and 291 bp) and 2 introns (105 and 1471 bp). Dee-Geo-Woo-Gen-type sd-1 mutants have a 383-bp deletion from the genome (278-bp deletion from the expressed sequence), from the middle of exon 1 to upstream of exon 2, including a 105-bp intron, resulting in a frame-shift that produces a termination codon after the deletion site.

For comprehensive functional analysis of the KIAA genes, it is necessary to prepare a set of cDNA clones which direct the synthesis of functional KIAA gene products. However, since the KIAA cDNAs were derived from long mRNAs (> 4 kb), it was not expected that all of them were full-length. Thus, as the first step toward preparing these clones, we evaluated the integrity of protein-coding sequences of KIAA cDNA clones through comparison with homologous protein entries in the public database. As a result, 1141 KIAA cDNAs had at least one homologous entry in the database, and 619 of them (54%) were found to be truncated at the 5′ and/or 3′ ends. In this study, 290 KIAA cDNA clones were tailored to be full-length or have considerably longer sequences than the original clones by isolating additional cDNA clones and/or connected parts of additional cDNAs or PCR products of the missing portion to the original cDNA clone. Consequently, 265, 8, and 17 predicted CDSs of KIAA cDNA clones were increased in the amino-, carboxy-, and both terminal sequences, respectively. In addition, 40 cDNA clones were modified to remove spurious interruption of protein-coding sequences. The total length of the resultant extensions at amino- and carboxy-terminals of KIAA gene products reached 97,000 and 7216 amino acid residues, respectively, and various protein domains were found in these extended portions.","We have accumulated information on protein-coding sequences of uncharacterized human genes, which are known as KIAA genes, through cDNA sequencing. For comprehensive functional analysis of the KIAA genes, it is necessary to prepare a set of cDNA clones which direct the synthesis of functional KIAA gene products. However, since the KIAA cDNAs were derived from long mRNAs (> 4 kb), it was not expected that all of them were full-length. Thus, as the first step toward preparing these clones, we evaluated the integrity of protein-coding sequences of KIAA cDNA clones through comparison with homologous protein entries in the public database. As a result, 1141 KIAA cDNAs had at least one homologous entry in the database, and 619 of them (54%) were found to be truncated at the 5′ and/or 3′ ends. In this study, 290 KIAA cDNA clones were tailored to be full-length or have considerably longer sequences than the original clones by isolating additional cDNA clones and/or connected parts of additional cDNAs or PCR products of the missing portion to the original cDNA clone. Consequently, 265, 8, and 17 predicted CDSs of KIAA cDNA clones were increased in the amino-, carboxy-, and both terminal sequences, respectively. In addition, 40 cDNA clones were modified to remove spurious interruption of protein-coding sequences.

These multiple bands appear to be derived from overlapping transcripts from both DNA strands, including non-coding RNAs and antisense RNAs in addition to mRNA. Such mechanisms may increase the transcriptional variation in S. pombe cells. "

RNA from the adult coral that was inhabited by symbiotic dinophytes was subjected to a similar RT-PCR, and a cDNA fragment, named AGfact-p , was found to encode an actin form distinct from LGfact. In an expression study, LGfact transcripts were present at similar levels in asymbiotic larvae and symbiotic adults, indicating that LGfact was expressed by the host. On the other hand, the expression of AGfact-p was detected in adults but not in larvae. Partial cDNA sequences of orthologues of LGfact and AGfact-p were detected in another scleractinian coral, Favites chinensis . A sequence identical to a part of AFcact-p (an AGfact-p orthologue) was amplified from the genomic DNA extracted from asymbiotic larvae of F. chinensis , strongly suggesting that AFcact-p was a coral actin cDNA. Thus, we presume that AGfact-p encodes an adult-specific form of actin in the host. A partial actin-encoding cDNA sequence (named Syact-p ) obtained from Symbiodinium sp. did not exhibit high levels of similarity to the coral actin sequences.
