IntroductionOlive (Olea europaea L.) is an evergreen species that is sensitive to winter chilling temperatures with severe leaf damage at -7°C.1 Olive oil is the major product extracted from olive fruit, and its consumption is steadily growing worldwide. The process of cold acclimation is very complex and involves diverse physiological, metabolic, and developmental changes that are under strict genetic control.2 The identity of the cold-stress sensor in plants is yet unknown.3 Nevertheless, early changes in membrane rigidification leading to certain cytoskeletal rearrangement has been proposed to be a cellular sensor for cold stress,4,5 in addition to metabolic or redox status alterations. Changes in membrane fluidity lead to a transient induction of Ca2+ channels and a raised cytosolic Ca2+ level, which acts as a second messenger in the early sensing of low temperatures.6 Cold acclimation is the result of several processes, such as the synthesis of cryoprotectant molecules and membrane phospholipids, protein stabilization, maintenance of ion homeostasis, and a stress response mainly mediated by the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS).7–9 Cold response involves around 1,000 genes in Arabidopsis, as previously shown by whole transcriptome analyses.10,11 A relevant number of cold-regulated genes encode transcription factors or proteins involved in transcription.12 Among these, C-repeat binding factor (CBF)/dehydration responsive element binding consists of transcriptional activators that provide one of the most important pathways for cold response.13–15 The expression of the CBF genes is induced after an increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ level and is responsible for controlling the expression of a large number of cold-response (COR) proteins.16 The CBFs bind to the low-temperature-responsive DNA-regulatory element termed C-repeat/dehydration-response element13,14 present in the promoters of many COR genes. Nevertheless, the analysis of cold acclimation in the olive drupe and seed has shown an important role of ‘fatty-acid desaturase (FAD)’ genes in cold tolerance and oil quality.17,18 These FAD genes contribute to cold acclimation by increasing the presence of unsaturated fatty acids which produce cell-membrane fluidification and F-actin stabilization.19,20 However, little is known about the gene-expression changes occurring during cold acclimation in this important crop, and no transcriptomic analysis has been conducted to determine the genetic changes induced by cold stress. The aim of this work was to study whole transcriptome changes induced in leaves of olive plants by above-freezing cold stress.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and cold-stress inductionTo induce stress by long-term exposure to low temperature, we used 4-month-old potted olive plants of the cv. Picual. These plants were obtained from a commercial nursery located in Córdoba province, southern Spain. Before being subjected to the low-temperature treatment, they were acclimated at 24°C day light for 3 weeks within the same controlled growth chamber where the cold-stress assay was conducted. Afterwards, we incubated a group of 35 plants under the following environmental conditions: 14-h photoperiod of fluorescent light at 65 µmol m2 s (10°C day/4°C night) for 10 days and constant 76–78% relative humidity. An additional group of 15 plants remained as a control treatment. Time of cold exposure was considered from the moment at which the growth chamber reached the working temperature for the first time in daylight (i.e. 10°C). Aerial tissues were then harvested at 0 h, 24 h, and 10 days (three plants/time point) after the start of the experiment. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until the extraction of total RNA. In order to build an olive transcriptome of diverse biotic and abiotic stresses, mechanical wounding and infection with the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae were also considered. This pathogen is the causal agent of Verticillium wilt of olive, one of the most serious diseases affecting olive cultivation in many areas.21 Therefore, an additional set of nursery-produced ‘Picual’ plants (40) were submitted to root-dip inoculation in a conidia suspension of a V. dahliae isolate representative of the so-called defoliating pathotype, following the procedure detailed in Mercado-Blanco et al.22 with the modification that inoculation time was only 30 min. Non-inoculated plants (40), but manipulated in the same way (control treatment), were used to obtain tissue samples of wounded plants in the absence of the pathogen. Functional genomics analysis of these responses will be published elsewhere, but the complete ‘olive stress transcriptome’ is referred here for the first time.2.2. RNA sample preparation and high-throughput sequencingRNA samples were extracted from the leaves of three replicates of control and the 24-h and 10-day cold-stress-treated plants. Total RNA was extracted using a Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any DNA contamination was removed by DNase I treatment on column (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The RNA quality tests were performed with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an RNA 6000 Pico assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We pooled RNA from each time and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries and sequencing in Illumina HiSeq 1000 sequencer was performed by GeneSystems (Valencia, Spain). Two replicates of each sample were sequenced on different lanes in the flow cell.2.3. Bioinformatic analysisQuality control of sequencing was performed using NGS_QC software.23 After trimming and cleaning, we obtained 149,638,888 paired-end reads of 101 bp length and 35 Phred quality (30.21 Gb). The ABySS-pe 1.3.3 software24,25 was used for de novo assembly in ‘Picasso’ supercomputer (www.scbi.uma.es). The ABySS software was chosen due to memory use and time limits for users in ‘Picasso’ at that moment, since ABySS had previously shown a good balance between memory use, runtime, and integrity of assembled genes.26 The command-line parameters used were abyss-pe k=64 n=10 j=2 name=library1 in=’/library1_R1.fastq library1_R2.fastq’ so that the minimum number of pairs required for building scaffolds was 10. We also included additional read sets corresponding to other stress conditions (Supplementary Data). Firstly, each library was assembled separately, producing a number of scaffolds ranging from 96,268 to 276,359. On average, the N50 length, average length, and maximal length for the 8,090,448 scaffolds obtained were 661, 312, and 8,791 bases, respectively. The mapping analysis with bowtie227 showed that 87.4% of reads on average aligned end to end on those scaffolds (bowtie2 parameters: -D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 22 -i S,1,1.15) and 93.2% aligned locally (-D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.75). Secondly, to collapse all related sequences that could not have done so during the first assembly step, the scaffolds of all libraries were assembled using ABySS single-end (k-mer = 63). Finally, contigs shorter than 200 bases and any sequence with no best hit for a plant but for a different organism were removed from the assembly using BLAST 2.2.20 software28 with a minimum expectation value of 1e-5. Mapping analysis with bowtie2 in the same way as above showed that 65% of reads on average aligned end to end on the final unigenes while 83.5% aligned locally. Other quality parameters for the new transcriptome were calculated by means of NGS_QC for the GC percentage, GenoToolBox (https://github.com/aubombarely/GenoToolBox) for basic stats, and Full-LengtherNext 0.0.8 (FLN) for sequence structure analysis.29Sma3s30,31 with default parameters was used in ‘Picasso’ supercomputer for functional annotation of all unigenes based on the similarity with UniProt-annotated sequences, in particular, using plant taxonomy. The gene-expression study was made with the DNAStar (ArrayStar 4) Qseq software for RNAseq analysis (www.dnastar.com). We undertook mapping using parameters k-mer = 63 and 95% of matches and used the default normalization method of ‘reads per kilobase per million mapped reads', RPKM.32 The gene ontology (GO) terms retrieved by Sma3s were loaded as an annotation file or .annot in the Blast2GO suite V2.7.033,34 to carry out the statistical analysis of GO-term enrichment. Blast2GO has integrated the Gossip package for statistical assessment of differences in GO-term abundance between two sets of sequences.35 This package employs the Fisher's exact test and corrects for multiple testing. We performed a one-tailed Fisher's exact test. The test was made using a false discovery rate (FDR), with a filter value <0.05. Blast2GO returns the GO terms over-represented at a specified significance value.34 The results were saved in a Microsoft Excel datasheet, and charts were generated.2.4. Quantitative real-time–polymerase chain reaction analysisFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA primed with 60 µM of random hexamer primer and Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase, using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT–PCR) was performed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 PCR system with master mix SsoFastTM EvaGreen® Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), in 10 µl of reaction mixture, containing 10 ng of cDNA. Amplifications were performed under the following conditions: initial polymerase activation at 98°C for 30, then 40 cycles at 98°C for 5 s, and at 60°C for 10 s, followed by a melting step from 65 to 95°C. An internal control of constitutive olive actin was used for the normalization of results. The constitutive normalization control was selected after comparing several genes and primer pairs on different olive tissues and found to be the most constant in expression.36 The oligonucleotides used for the amplifications are listed in Supplementary Data. Each PCR reaction was performed three times, and three different trees were analysed at every time of cold exposure.2.5.

Results and discussion3.1. Environmental conditions and stress symptoms of olive plants under low-temperature treatmentOlive ‘Picual’ plants subjected to low temperature displayed clearly visible symptoms of stress 24 h after starting the experiment, compared with control plants (Fig. 1A and B). The vast majority of plants had flaccid leaves, resembling wilting symptoms (Fig. 1C and D). However, 4–5 days after the start of the experiment, plants progressively recovered from these symptoms, and nearly no trace of flaccid or wilted leaves remained at the end of the experiment (10 days of exposure to low temperature) (Fig. 1E and F). This result shows that a sudden fall in temperature, even if this is above 0°C, can trigger clear morphological changes and stress symptoms in olive plants. However, in just a few days most plants were fully recovered and were not distinguishable from the unstressed ones. Low-temperature treatment caused an overproduction of H2O2 accompanied by a down-regulation of SOD isoenzymes, a key enzyme of the ascorbate–glutathione cycle (APX) and an antioxidant NADP-dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH). During long-term cold acclimation at 10 days, a slight recovery of Mn-SOD and NADP-ICDH was detected, indicating that a mechanism of cold acclimation takes place (Supplementary Data). This showed the ability of olive plants to rapidly acclimate to prolonged cold stress.

Transcriptome assembly, functional annotation, and expression analysisThe transcriptome was assembled from a total of 741,674,755 high-quality paired-end reads (149.77 Gb; Supplementary Data). Each sample was separately assembled using the ABySS-pe software with a k-mer = 64. Finally, all samples were re-assembled together with the ABySS single-end using a k-mer = 63. The final transcriptome (OlePic) contains 157,799 unigenes with an N50 length of 700 bases, an average length of 544 bases, a maximal length of 11,114 bases, 46% GC, and 0% undetermined. The distribution by length of the unigenes generated in the assembly is shown in Fig. 2A. The result shows that although OlePic has a higher number of assembled transcripts, the distribution by length is similar to the currently available, most complete olive transcriptome AS8. In addition, OlePic is enriched in longer contigs than AS8 in a similar way as the Mimulus guttatus one, the available plant transcriptome most phylogenetically related to Olive tree.37 On the other hand, mapping analysis with bowtie2 showed that, on average, 65% of original reads aligned with OlePic end to end and 83.5% aligned locally. It can therefore be concluded that the vast majority of the reads sequenced are represented in this new transcriptome. Another common assessment of the quality of the assembled database is provided by the coverage. The minimum k-mer coverage for each unigene was 400 (Fig. 2B), and 88% of contigs were covered for >1,000 k-mer of 63 bases. Regarding cold stress, all reads derived from the cold experiment samples were mapped end to end to the assembly (Fig. 2C). In addition, 73.3% of unigenes were covered for reads obtained in this study (115,644 unigenes). From these unigenes, 82.5% were covered by more than at least 50 reads. The OlePic transcripts’ similarity and transcriptome coverage with olive AS8 transcriptome and other phylogenetically related species (monkey flower,37 tomato,38 grapevine39 and rose gum40) were measured by blastn algorithm from BLAST software at different expectation values (Fig. 3). Consistently with the established phylogenetic relationships, the percentage of cDNA sequences with hits in OlePic was proportional to the different species phylogenetic likelihood.

The cDNA sequences of AS8 and olive-related plant species were mapped to OlePic by using the blastn algorithm from blast/2.2.20 software.The annotation algorithm used, Sma3s, searches with three steps of significance that sequentially retrieve annotations from (i) already existing annotated sequences, (ii) orthologous sequences, and (iii) groups of sequences sharing a statistically significant pattern. Nevertheless, Sma3s retrieved annotations from Uniprot plant database for 48% of the transcriptome (75,772 unigenes).All in all, ABySS reduced the original number of sequences by 99.99%. The percentage of GC was very similar to that of 42.5% reported previously for other olive assemblies.30,41 Unlike these recent studies, our starting material consisted exclusively of short reads. Nevertheless, the average length, integrity of assembled genes, and number of unigenes annotated were improved compared with the currently available, most complete olive transcriptome AS8.30 In addition, analysis of OlePic with FLN comparing with AS8 and M. guttatus (28,282 protein-coding transcripts) indicates a similar structure pattern in OlePic compared with AS8 (Supplementary Data). As expected, FLN found 27,207 M. guttatus transcripts with orthologue of which 18,344 were complete. FLN found 88,034 transcripts with orthologues in OlePic of which 11,436 were complete. This supports the contention that the use of short paired-end data can lead to an efficient assembly of transcriptomes, as previously anticipated.42,43 Furthermore, another mapping analysis with bowtie2 algorithm showed that 69% of AS8 sequences aligned locally in OlePic assembly. Taking into account that AS8 was constructed from different cultivars and more diverse tissues, global results indicate that our assembly is good enough to analyse gene-expression changes in olive tree; and, more importantly, it includes environmental-stress-response transcripts which are crucial for this study. The RNAseq analysis showed 6,309 unigenes differentially expressed with a minimum 8-fold change and 95% significance.3.3. Short-term transient gene-expression changes in response to cold stressThe response of plants to prolonged stress stimuli may involve both transient reactions shortly decaying after the first moments of stress exposure and adaptive changes sustained over time. The result of comparing 0 and 1 day of cold exposure was that 1,694 unigenes were differentially expressed (8-fold change and 95% significance), 1,094 of them were over-expressed, and 600 were repressed after the first 24 h of low-temperature exposure. However, about half of these unigenes (896) returned to normal expression levels after 10 days of low-temperature exposure (890 over-expressed and only 6 repressed). These unigenes represent a group of genes showing a transient response to cold stress (Fig. 4A and B; Supplementary Data). This transient response resulted from the induction of expression for at least the first 24 h of cold stress in almost all genes. However, expression returned to normal levels after prolonged exposure to low temperature.

The GO terms retrieved by Sma3s for 361 sequences from 910 transient unigenes and for 43,696 sequences from 97,532 unigenes expressed in control leaves were loaded in Blast2GO suite V2.7.0 to perform the statistical analysis of GO-term enrichment. Unchecked, the two-tail box was used to analyse only positive enrichment. The test was made choosing a filter cut-off value of FDR < 1e-7. The results are shown in Fig. 5 as the percentage of sequences which annotated for each ‘biological process' GO term for both control leaves and transient COR unigenes. Bars are labelled with their corresponding P-values in the Fisher exact test. Most of the GO terms were parent–child related and involved mainly in lipid polymers, oligosaccharide, and polyamine metabolism (Fig. 5).

Unigenes that annotated for these processes were identified, including GPAT5 (494,160 and 276,135), FAE1 (unigenes 47,056, 481,778, and 497,978), and CER1/WAX2 (unigenes 372,554, 24,079, 312,953, 306,126, 456,548, and 409,294). Here, we report six CER-like genes in olive, all of which respond transiently to cold stress. In addition, 81 unigenes annotated for seven GO terms associated with oligosaccharide metabolism (Fig. 5). Oligosaccharides are ubiquitous in plants and have been associated with freezing tolerance in various species. Four unigenes (362,593, 453,896, 511,359, and 174,049) were associated with the seven GO terms and coded for a stachyose synthase.On the other hand, we observed a transient induction for several unigenes involved in polyamine biosynthesis including arginine decarboxylases (ADC) (unigenes 62,085, 57,082, 612,727, 22,384, 531,518, 266,717, 417,814, 417,815, 416,039, and 494,283), amine oxidase flavin domain-containing protein (unigenes 233,490 and 205,434), and peroxisome polyamine oxidase (unigenes 515,010 and 479,660).Consequently, with most representative ‘biological processes' found, statistically significant GO terms for ‘biological function’ were arginine decarboxylase activity, aldehyde decarbonylase activity, oxidoreductase activity, carbon–carbon lyase activity, oxidoreductase activity, choline kinase activity, inositol 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase activity, and beta-amylase activity. No ‘biological component’ GO term was found for the chosen FDR cut-off.3.4. Early long-term gene expression changes during cold acclimationTogether with the transient response to cold stress, a set of genes showing a sustained response to cold stress for a prolonged time period (10 days) was identified. Thus, 798 unigenes out of the 1,694 with significant 8-fold change between 0 and 1 day under low temperature still remained up-regulated 10 days under cold stress. Therefore, these genes are likely to take part in an adaptive response to low temperature. In this case, 204 unigenes were induced during the cold exposure, whereas 594 were repressed (Fig. 4C and D; Supplementary Data).One important adaptive response to cold is the induction of FADs to regulate the fluidity of the cellular membrane. Indeed, an increase in FAD activity relaxes cellular membrane rigidity.44 In olive, FAD2.2 and FAD7 increased their expression in epi–mesocarp cells during the oleogenic period.17 However, just OeFAD2 transcription increased in both the embryo and the seed coat in cold-acclimated drupes.18,45 We have found in the olive transcriptome unigenes that the code for FAD2.1, FAD2.2, FAD6, FAD7, and two FAD3, one previously described that we have called FAD3.1 and a new one called FAD3.2. The RNAseq analysis has shown that OeFAD2.2 is the only FAD-coding gene that increased its expression in response to cold in ‘Picual’ leaves (Fig. 6A). The OeFAD2.2 was induced shortly after the start of the cold exposure and maintained a high expression level after 10 days of low-temperature treatment (Fig. 6A), even though a general tendency towards a reduction in transcription was observed for most genes (Fig. 7). This could probably be explained as a consequence of a diminished metabolism of the plant. This finding supports the idea that FAD2.2 is the desaturase involved in cold response in olive leaves, in agreement with previous results,17,18,45 suggesting that FAD2.2 is the main desaturase involved in cold response in olive.

We found four unigenes that were induced by cold in a sustained manner while the low temperature persisted. However, three of them decreased their expression between 1 and 10 days of cold exposure but still remained significantly higher than in control plants (Fig. 6B). The four CBF genes were strongly induced between 0 and 1 day of low-temperature exposure. Nevertheless, only OeCBF3 showed a steady increase in its expression after 10 days of cold treatment, suggesting that OeCBF3 might be responsible for inducing COR gene expression, showing a late response to cold stress (Table 1 and Fig. 6B). The sequence similarity between Arabidopsis CBF coding sequences and the OeCBF unigenes did not allow us to identify exact orthologues in the Arabidopsis CBF family. Thus, they were numbered without any correspondence to the Arabidopsis nomenclature (Table 1). This means that the family of CBF genes in olive consists of at least four genes with an unclear correspondence to the Arabidopsis annotation of CBF1, CBF2, or CBF3.

The percentage of sequences that annotated for each ‘biological process' or ‘function’ GO term for both control and early long-term COR unigenes is shown in Fig. 8. No ‘biological component’ GO term was found for the chosen FDR cut-off. These unigenes were enriched in GO terms associated with three processes: regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis, cold acclimation, and development regulation. This result supports the idea that these genes are likely involved in an adaptive response to low temperature.

Twenty unigenes were associated with nitrogen metabolism and 34 with photosynthesis (Supplementary Data). Therefore, our results indicate a down-regulation of photosynthesis and plant growth, and both ‘component’ and ‘function’ GO terms found were consistent with these results.3.5. Late long-term gene-expression changes during cold acclimationPlants respond to stress by global transcriptional changes that can be transient or sustained over time and with early- and late-responsive gene-expression alterations.46 Changes in gene expression in response to cold can be affected by differences in cold sensitivity. For instance, a general up-regulation trend in a chilling-tolerant genotype and an overall repression tendency in a sensitive genotype were found in rice.47 In our study, ‘Picual’ olive plants were subjected to low temperatures to which they can acclimate, and the cold-stress symptoms disappeared after 6 or 7 days of cold exposure (Fig. 1). We found a general trend towards gene repression after a period of 24 h at low temperature (Fig. 7). Thus, at 8-fold change and 95% significance, 4,551 unigenes were down-regulated between days 1 and 10 of low-temperature exposure and only 64 unigenes were over-expressed.We performed the GO-term enrichment analysis as above with the GO terms retrieved by Sma3s for 31 sequences from 64 over-expressed late long-term unigenes using a cut-off value of FDR < 0.01. The percentage of sequences that annotated for each ‘biological process' or ‘function’ GO term for both control leaves and early long-term COR unigenes is shown in Fig. 9. No ‘biological component’ GO term was found for the chosen FDR cut-off. It was observed that the most representative processes were related to organelle fusion, nucleus organization, and DNA integration (Fig. 9). Among 20 sequences associated with organelle fusion and nucleus organization, four Flavin Adenin (FAD)-binding Berberine-like unigenes (unigenes 254,633, 435,666, 525,595, and 313,705) were shared by both processes. Six sequences were associated with DNA integration. They were annotated as Ty3-gypsy subclass, Gag-pol polyprotein, retroelement polyprotein-like, Copia-type polyprotein, and integrase (unigenes 104,981, 285,292, 627,965, 95,624, 510,781, and 36,107). Thus, they are putative transposable elements (TEs, jumping genes).

The ‘biological processes’, ‘functions’, and ‘components’ associated with 2,147 from 4,551 repressed unigenes are shown in Supplementary Data. Results confirmed that unigenes related to photosynthesis and plant growth are inhibited mostly during a late response to cold. Further experimental evidence is required to determine whether AGO-like, bHLH-like, Berberine-like, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons are responsible for this major down-regulation during late cold acclimation in olive tree.3.6. RNAseq validation by Q-RT–PCRThe expression of 20 randomly selected genes was analysed by Q-RT–PCR in nine trees, three for each time of cold exposure. As a result, the pattern of expression observed was very similar between Q-RT–PCR and RNAseq results in 18 of the 20 genes analysed, while for OlePic_t_481778 the induction after 1 day of cold exposure was weaker by Q-RT–PCR than by RNAseq, and for OlePic_t_288134 the pattern was opposite at 10 days of cold exposure (Fig. 10). This result confirms that the expression patterns of mRNA obtained by RNAseq reflect real changes of gene expression. Figure 10.Open in new tabDownload slideAnalysis of mRNA level by Q-RT–PCR.

ConclusionsOlive plants cv. Picual were sensitive to cold stress as observed by morphological and ROS enzymes changes. However, they were also able to fully recover after 5 days of low temperatures, indicating the existence of acclimation mechanisms to cold. A new transcriptome for stressed olive plants was built up and used to analyse the transcriptomic response to cold. We found 6,309 unigenes differentially expressed in response to cold, which were included in three types of responses leading to cold acclimation: a short-term transient response including 890 over-expressed and only 6 repressed unigenes, an early long-term response that consisted in 204 over-expressed and 594 repressed unigenes, and a late long-term response with 4,551 unigenes down-regulated between days 1 and 10 of low temperature exposure, and just 64 unigenes were over-expressed.The results presented here suggest a complex acclimation response to cold in olive leaves with early transient or long-term and late transcriptional responses.FundingThis work was supported by grant AGR-5948 from Junta de Andalucía (Consejería de Economía, Innovación y Ciencia) and Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación.

IntroductionMethylation occurring at the position 5 of cytosine residues in DNA is an epigenetic modification critically involved in the regulation of eukaryotic genomes. Accordingly, the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine residues, or the methylome, has been attracting intense attention from a wide audience in a variety of research disciplines. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the way of interrogating the methylome: it has realized whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or genome-wide methylation analysis at single-base resolution.1,2 The power of WGBS has been well demonstrated by many findings that would never have been achieved with other technologies. Although WGBS represents the gold standard for methylome analysis and is rapidly becoming the method of choice, its cost has remained substantial, thereby preventing it from being widely used for multi-sample comparison of large methylomes including those of mammals.The most popular alternative to WGBS is reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), which efficiently enriches CpG-rich regions through restriction enzyme digestion to reduce the cost of sequencing, while maintaining deep coverage of a subset of CpG sites.3 Notably, RRBS can be applied to a minute amount of input DNA.4 However, it cannot be used to examine particular regions of interest unless they are adequately flanked by the restriction enzyme sites. In this context, the shotgun bisulfite sequencing of subgenomic regions enriched using solution hybridization capture technology, referred to hereafter as targeted methylome sequencing (TMS), is ideal, because it can in principle target any unique genomic region.5–7 However, all of the TMS protocols reported thus far require not only a considerable amount of input DNA (i.e. 3 µg or more), but also a large number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles (i.e. 10–20 cycles), making it difficult to apply TMS to samples of limited quantity.We recently developed a highly efficient protocol for WGBS library construction termed post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT).8 Although it is well known that bisulfite treatment destroys DNA, all of the conventional ligation-based WGBS protocols as well as the tagmentation-based one9 treat adaptor-tagged library DNAs with bisulfite, inevitably leading to a considerable loss of intact sequencing template molecules. To circumvent this bisulfite-induced loss, we proposed the PBAT strategy in which adaptor tagging is performed after bisulfite treatment. This simple trick allowed us to prepare a PCR-free WGBS library from as little as 125 pg of input DNA.8 We routinely achieve a PCR-free, 30-fold coverage of mammalian methylomes from ~30 ng of input DNA. Indeed, PBAT has been applied to mouse WGBS from 400 to 1,000 germinal vesicle-stage oocytes10,11 and a few thousand primordial germ cells,12 notably without any global PCR amplification. More recently, it has even been applied to single-cell genome-wide bisulfite sequencing with the aid of PCR.13As all of the current TMS protocols include bisulfite treatment of adaptor-tagged library DNA, we reasoned that PBAT can improve the efficiency of TMS to develop a low-input protocol (Fig. 1). We have indeed succeeded in the development of a highly efficient TMS method applicable to samples of limited quantity. Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideTwo strategies for TMS.

Materials and methods2.1. Preparation of DNABoth human and mouse genomic DNAs used in the model experiments were purchased from Promega. Genomic DNA from IMR90 primary human lung fibroblasts was a generous gift from Yae Kanai. The indicated amount of genomic DNA was dissolved in 130 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and sheared with Covaris S220 to the indicated size. We used AMPure XP to purify the fragmented DNA as follows. First, the shared DNA (130 µl) was mixed with 1.8× volume (234 µl) of the AMPure XP reagent and stood for 15 min at room temperature. Next, the beads were collected using a magnet stand, and the supernatant was removed. The pelleted beads were then rinsed with 70% ethanol and dried by standing at 37°C for 5 min. Finally, DNA was eluted from the beads to 20 µl of RNase-free water. The eluted DNA solution was dried in a vacuum concentrator and dissolved in 7 µl of RNase-free water.2.2. Target enrichmentEnrichment of targets with liquid-phase hybridization capture was performed using the reagents in SureSelect Human or Mouse Methyl-Seq kit (Agilent). Genomic DNA (7 µl) fragmented and purified as above was supplemented with 3 µl of formamide (Wako, Biochemistry grade) and overlaid with 80 µl of mineral oil (Sigma). The DNA was completely denatured by incubating the tube at 99°C for 10 min, cooled down to 65°C and kept at 65°C for at least 5 min before adding the following reagents. Hybridization buffer was prepared by mixing 7.5, 0.3, 3.0 and 3.0 µl of Hyb#1, #2, #3 and #4, respectively. Capture probe mix was prepared by mixing 5.0, 0.5 and 1.0 µl of capture probe solution, RNase Inhibitor and RNase-free water, respectively. The hybridization buffer and the capture probe mix were individually overlaid with 80 µl of mineral oil and incubated at 65°C for 10 min. These two solutions were then combined and mixed thoroughly by pipetting. The combined solution was transferred to the tube containing the denatured input DNA kept at 65°C as above and mixed thoroughly with the DNA solution by pipetting. The tube was incubated at 65°C for at least 24 h to allow hybridization between the probes and the targets.Fifty microlitres of well-suspended solution of DynaBeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Life Technologies) was taken into a 1.5-ml tube, and the beads were washed 2 times with 200 µl of Binding Buffer. To the pelleted beads, the hybridization reaction supplemented with 200 µl of Binding Buffer was added and mixed well. After incubation with rocking at room temperature for 30 min, the beads were collected using a magnetic stand and washed with 500 µl of Wash Buffer 1. The beads were then subjected to three rounds of washing, each composed of re-suspension in pre-warmed Buffer 2 followed by incubation at 65°C for 10 min. Following thorough removal of washing solutions from the tube, enriched DNA was eluted by incubating the beads in 20 µl of Elution solution at room temperature for 20 min. The eluate was immediately used for bisulfite treatment.2.3. Bisulfite treatmentEZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research) was used for the bisulfite treatment of target-enriched DNA, according to manufacturer's instruction. The enriched DNA solution (20 µl) was directly mixed with 130 µl of CT conversion reagent freshly prepared before use. The mixture was incubated at 64°C for 2.5 h. Note that the incubation step at 98°C for 10 min described in the instruction was omitted, because the target-enriched DNA was already denatured. Following the purification and desulfonation steps, bisulfite-treated DNA was eluted with 20 µl of M-Elution buffer.2.4. PBAT library construction and Illumina sequencingWe used the bisulfite-treated DNA for library preparation according to the PBAT protocol14 (also available from http://crest-ihec.jp/english/epigenome/index.html), except for the primers used in the first- and second-strand synthesis. The primer used for the first-strand synthesis was 5'-ACA CTC TTT CCC TAC ACG ACG CTC TTC CGA TCT WWW WNN NN-3' (W = A or T). The indexed primers used for the second-strand synthesis was 5'-CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT XXX XXX GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GCA GGA AAC AGC TAT GAC WWW WNN NN-3', in which XXX XXX stands for the index sequence of each primer. We sequenced the constructed TMS libraries using Illumina HiSeq2500 as described previously.142.5. Data analysisThe obtained reads were mapped to human and mouse DNA using the hg19 and mm9 assemblies, respectively, analysed and visualized as described previously.83. Results3.1. PBAT to target-enriched DNATo test whether PBAT is applicable to TMS library construction, we applied it to target-enriched DNA prepared using the RNA probes provided in the Agilent SureSelect Mouse Methyl-Seq kit, which are designed to cover mouse genomic regions spanning 109 Mb in total. As PBAT employs random primer extension, it is ideal that the primer hybridizes to the 3'-flanking region of each target region in the input DNA and initiates the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand to fully span the target region. We therefore assumed the size of the input DNA to be critical and first examined its effects on the yield of the library. Starting from 3 µg of input DNA, as recommended by the manufacturer, we prepared DNA fragments with an average length of 180 bp, 400 bp or 2 kb (Supplementary DataA). From these DNA preparations, we enriched the targets by solution hybridization capture and successfully generated PCR-free single-read PBAT libraries, each of which was sufficient for one or more lanes in the HiSeq2500 system (Supplementary DataB). Note that the original Methyl-Seq protocol requires a total of 14 cycles of global PCR amplification when starting from the same amount of input DNA (i.e. 3 µg). As expected, the raw yield of library increased with the size of input DNA (Supplementary DataB). However, the normalized yield by the size of input DNA indicated that the 400-bp DNA fragments were most efficient. In addition, the library generated from the 2-kb DNA fragments contained a substantial number of off-target reads that were mapped near to but not onto the targets (Supplementary DataC). We therefore decided to use input DNA fragmented to a size of 400 bp for further development.3.2. Novel primers for improved yield of indexed TMS librariesIt is highly likely that the users of TMS intend to sequence two or more indexed libraries in a single lane for efficient data collection. Thus, we next attempted to improve the efficiency of the PBAT paired-end/indexed read protocol, because it is 2-fold less sensitive than the single-read protocol.14 While the original PBAT protocol uses a random tetramer sequence (N4) attached to the 3'-end of primers containing Illumina adaptor sequences,8 we found that novel primers containing a semi-random tetramer composed solely of A or T bases immediately upstream of the random tetramer (W4N4; W = A or T) improved the yield of TMS library by ~4-fold, with a marginal effect on the GC bias in target coverage (Supplementary Data). We also found that the addition of formamide to the hybridization capture reaction at a final concentration of 10% improved the reproducibility of the target enrichment step (data not shown). These modifications were critical to perform highly sensitive and robust construction of TMS libraries.3.3. Characterization of low-input PBAT-mediated TMS librariesUsing the protocol optimized as above, we prepared indexed TMS libraries from 3,000 to 10 ng of human and mouse DNA using the human and mouse RNA probe sets obtained from Agilent, respectively (Table 1). The yield of library DNA was nearly linearly correlated with the amount of input DNA (Table 1; Supplementary DataA). The smaller the amount of input DNA, the more evident the adaptor dimers were (Supplementary DataB). We performed the minimum cycles of PCR amplification to obtain sufficient DNA for a single HiSeq2500 lane (Table 1). We then used a half lane to sequence each of the human libraries and mapped the obtained reads to the reference human genome sequence. (Note that we combined the library DNA with the same amount of the PhiX control to compensate the extreme base bias of bisulfite-converted sequences.) The mapping rate was inversely correlated with the amount of input DNA within the range of 3,000 to 30 ng, but it showed a prominent decline when the DNA input was reduced to 10 ng (Table 1). In addition, all of the libraries except the one generated from 10 ng of DNA showed similar statistics regarding the coverage of the targets (Fig. 2A). The methylation levels of CpG sites covered by 20 or more reads were highly consistent among these five libraries (R2 > 0.95, when the window size and the step were 500 and 250 bp, respectively) (Fig. 2B). We inspected the methylation status of imprinted genes and found that the expected 50% methylation level was faithfully recapitulated, even in the library generated from 30 ng of DNA, but not in the library obtained from 10 ng of DNA (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the PBAT-mediated TMS method is reliably applicable to as little as 30 ng of input DNA. Table 1.Summary of library constructionTarget species (Target size)

The green dashed box denoted the ICR of PEG3 (chr.19: 57,351,728 to 57,352,173 in hg19 human reference genome sequence).We also performed Methyl-Seq from the same human genomic DNA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer, except that fewer PCR cycles were used (i.e. 11 cycles instead of 14 cycles), and compared the results with those of PBAT-mediated TMS. While the two data sets showed largely consistent methylation levels (R2 = 0.88) (Fig. 2B), they were distinct in terms of the GC content of the covered targets: Methyl-Seq and PBAT-mediated TMS preferentially covered AT-rich and GC-rich targets, respectively (Supplementary Data). This was presumably because the extensive global PCR step in Methyl-Seq failed to amplify GC-rich regions and because the random priming from the PBAT adaptor primers was rather compromised in AT-rich regions. We also note that the Methyl-Seq data recapitulated the methylation status of imprinted genes less precisely than the PBAT data (Fig. 2C).Having confirmed the high efficiency and consistency of PBAT-mediated TMS, we next compared it with WGBS. We performed TMS using 300 ng of genomic DNA from human IMR90 cells and compared the resulting data with PBAT-mediated WGBS data from the same cell line. The methylation levels of CpG sites covered by 20 or more reads showed an excellent correlation between the two data sets in either the window-based or the nucleotide-based analysis (Fig. 3). These results indicated that TMS can be a reliable alternative to WGBS. Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideConsistency between TMS and WGBS data.

DiscussionWGBS has become the gold standard method in methylomics for its unsurpassed resolution and coverage. However, it is too expensive to be used for analysing multiple samples. Efforts have thus been paid to develop cost-effective alternatives to WGBS, including various TMS methods based on padlock probes, array capture and solution hybridization capture.7 Among these approaches, the last one is highly flexible, but current protocols require a considerable amount of input DNA and are not applicable to samples of limited quantity.5,6 Furthermore, they include extensive global PCR amplification, which may increase the risk of inaccurate estimate of methylation levels, especially when the quantity of input DNA is limited. Therefore, a novel TMS protocol is desirable that requires a much smaller amount of input DNA with far fewer cycles of global PCR amplification than current ones. As the inefficiency of current protocols is likely attributable to bisulfite-induced degradation of target-enriched library DNA (Fig. 1A), we reasoned that the PBAT strategy can circumvent the adverse effect of bisulfite treatment to improve the efficiency of TMS (Fig. 1B).We tested the possibility using the biotinylated RNA probes in the Agilent Methyl-Seq kit designed to cover CpG islands with their shores and shelves, enhancers, promoters, differentially methylated regions and other regulatory elements. Our results demonstrated that PBAT enables TMS from a 100-fold smaller amount of input DNA (i.e. 30 versus 3,000 ng) with considerably fewer cycles of PCR amplification (i.e. 4 versus 11–14 cycles) than the original protocol provided by the manufacturer (Table 1; Fig. 2). It also enables PCR-free TMS, provided that 1 µg of input DNA is available. Furthermore, the coverage statistics and the methylation levels of imprinted genes indicated that the PBAT-mediated protocol has superior coverage and accuracy than the original one (Fig. 2). We also confirmed high consistency between PBAT-mediated TMS and WGBS (Fig. 3), proving that the former can serve as a reliable surrogate for the latter. Although further improvements are necessary to generate high-quality TMS libraries from <30 ng of input DNA and to achieve more even coverage of the targets regardless of their GC contents, the PBAT-mediated protocol significantly outperforms the original Methyl-Seq protocol. It will be also useful for base-resolution analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine when applied to genomic DNA treated with adequate oxidants or enzymes.15,16We also evaluated the cost performance of PBAT-mediated TMS in comparison with those of PBAT-mediated WGBS and RRBS. The TMS is ~10 times less expensive than the WGBS, when the former and the latter use the high output mode of HiSeq to achieve 40-fold coverage of the target regions and the whole genome, respectively. Note that, the deeper the coverage is, the more cost effective the TMS is. While the target regions in the TMS cover only ~2.8% of the human genome, they include approximately one-seventh of the total CpG sites. On the other hand, the TMS costs 4–5 times more but covers only ~1.5 times more CpG sites than RRBS does. Nevertheless, the TMS likely remains highly competitive to RRBS in many instances, since the former covers a much broader range of genomic elements than the latter.Taken together, PBAT significantly enhances the utility of TMS to enable various novel applications, especially those analysing a large number of precious samples. The PBAT-mediated TMS will thus serve as an invaluable tool for epigenomics.5.

IntroductionThe onion (Allium cepa) belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae, containing over 300 species; of which, 70 have been cultivated for 4,700 years or more.1 The onion is one of the major vegetable crops in the world. In 2012, onions were grown in 170 countries with global production of 87 million tons (http://faostat.fao.org/). Onions contain outstanding levels of polyphenols, vitamins, and sulphur-containing compounds, which are responsible for their pungency.2–4 Those compounds also affect various aspects of human health, including support for bone and connective tissues, anti-inflammatory effects, diabetes prevention, digestive tract health, and cancer protection.2 Hence, many traits were developed or are under development for onion breeding, including bulb shape, bulb colour, bulb size, flowering time, pungency, nutritional value, and disease resistance.Despite the importance and significance of Allium species as major vegetable crops with nutritional and medicinal values, poor genomic information is available because of the enormous size of the genome (16.3 Gb).5 Although sequencing technologies have advanced rapidly in terms of higher throughput and longer read lengths, analysis of the complex and huge genome of the onion, a non-model plant, has remained a Herculean task.6,7 Currently, only a few information resources on the onion genome are available, including 511 proteins and 20,159 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in GenBank, and those are insufficient for use in molecular breeding. Therefore, alternative sources of genomic information about the onion are required and have begun to be developed through transcriptome sequencing.5High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful and cost-effective tool to determine the structures of whole genes within genomes8–13 as well as to reveal a variety of biological information.14–18 Furthermore, for non-model organisms, it has been feasible to obtain whole transcripts without prior knowledge of a reference genome using de novo transcriptome analysis.19–23 Recent studies reported, however, that most RNA-Seq sequences and assembled transcripts contain various types of sequences such as introns, transposable elements (TEs), and non-coding RNAs, which are unnecessary information for construction of protein-coding genes.16,24–26 In most cases, gene annotation of de novo transcriptome assemblies is performed using ‘a six-frame translation’ approach without considering non-coding sequences.17,27–33 Large groups of non-coding sequences are therefore fully or partially included in the assembled transcripts, creating a potential barrier to accurate gene annotation. Constructing a precise and refined reference transcriptome is a prerequisite for reliability in further studies.To this end, we generated a high-quality de novo assembly of onion transcriptome containing a large, annotated gene set using a standard gene-prediction pipeline by combining reference mapping and ab initio gene models. By validating the data using pre-existing gene sets, we have provided a reliable reference gene set for future genomic and genetic research on Allium spp. Furthermore, our study provides a useful model of a comprehensive approach to high-quality de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation in non-model species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and cDNA library constructionA short-day type, doubled haploid onion with red bulbs (H6) and a lab-derived inbred line (SP3B) were used for cDNA synthesis and sequencing. Six weeks after planting vernalized bulbs, whole seedlings were harvested and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA of each samples were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and quality of extracted RNAs was inspected with Pico RNA chip and Pico6000 RNA reagent (Agilent Technologies) using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Strand-specific RNA-Seq paired-end libraries (insert size of 300–400 bp) were prepared according to the previous protocol,34 and the constructed libraries were used for transcriptome sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000.2.2. De novo transcriptome assemblyThe raw sequences of the onion transcriptome were processed using an in-house preprocessing pipeline to remove unnecessary sequences for the assembly.35 The preprocessing pipeline consisted of four steps. First, contaminating bacterial sequences were filtered out by mapping the reads to reference bacterial genomes in GenBank using Bowtie2 v2.0.0-beta7 (--local -D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.65).36 Secondly, duplicated short reads were removed. Thirdly, low-quality sequences with quality scores below Q20 were eliminated and sequences over 70 bp were remained using an in-house perl script. Finally, rRNA sequences were filtered out using SortMeRNA v1.9 (default parameter).37 The preprocessed sequences from H6 and SP3B and also a combined library of the sequences from both accessions were assembled using Velvet v1.2.0838 (-ins_length 400 -ins_length_sd 200) and Oases v0.2.0639 with a default parameter. To increase the assembly quality, iterative assemblies were performed to identify the k-mer values that gave the optimal total and average transcript lengths for each library. Thus, the optimal read lengths of 49, 47, and 53 bp were selected for the final assembly of H6, SP3B, and the combined library, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).2.3. Structural and functional annotationStructural gene annotation of the transcriptome was performed using the integrated structural gene annotation pipeline (ISGAP; Fig. 1). First, we used the reference gene annotations of monocot plants including Musa acuminata version 1.0,40Oryza sativa RAP version 7.0,41Phyllostachys heterocycla version 1.0,42Sorghum bicolor version 1.0,43 and Brachypodium distachyon version 1.044 to perform protein alignments using Exonerate v2.2.045 with parameters --percent 30 and --maxintron 50,000 to find gene structures within the assembled transcripts. We then merged the detected gene structures which have same exon–exon junctions and constructed consensus sequences to use as initial gene models in the first step. During that process, we removed gene models that included frame shifts and early stop codons as well as remained one of the gene structures, which derived from a larger amount of evidence proteins and have a higher mapping score than other gene models in same regions. In the second step, partial genes in the initial gene models were extended through additional translation based on fixed frame of each gene model starting from five or three prime end of the partial genes to start or end region of the assembled transcript until translation of start or stop codon. In the third step, we constructed a training set of onion gene models using 2,000 of the complete genes generated by the second process, and we then ran Augustus46 using the training set. After filtering the abnormal gene models from Augustus, the initial gene models were integrated into a new gene model by extending the reference proteins without overlap. In the final step, after filtering the resulting gene models against the NR database in GenBank, we determined the final gene models. Integrated structural gene annotation pipeline (ISGAP).

(A) ISGAP based on reference proteins and ab initio prediction. (B) The six-frame translation method as an independent process.For the final gene models, we extracted representative gene models remaining one of the genes, which have a longest complete form existing both start and stop codon in same locus of assembled transcripts. In case of no complete genes in the locus, we selected a longest partial gene as a representative gene model in the locus. The biological functions of the final gene models were assigned using InterProScan version 5-46,47 the plant proteins in the RefSeq database,48 and the Uniprot database,49 which contains the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases with cut-off values e-value over 1e-5.2.4. Evaluation of the predicted gene setsThe gene models predicted by ISGAP and the six-frame translation were validated by aligning the assembled transcripts to both the onion and the plant proteins of the RefSeq database48 in GenBank using Exonerate v2.2.0.45 To obtain accurate gene regions, we applied strict parameters for both validations (--percent 70 and over 90% mapping coverage). All of the correctly aligned regions that allowed redundancy, except for cases where a frame shift and early stop codon were detected, were compared as independent query sequences to the gene models predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation. The gene models were evaluated based on their ability to represent query sequences considering the matched region, strand, and frame.2.5. Sequence variation between the two accessionsA comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed to detect variation between H6 and SP3B. To detect variation, a reference-guided assembly was conducted by mapping the preprocessed raw SP3B sequence data to the H6 assembly via Bowtie2 v2.0.0-beta736 (default parameter) Samtools v0.1.1850 and SNPeff v3.3h51 (-minC 5 -minQ 20) identified sequence variation and classified type of the variation by region of the assembled transcripts. To find more reliable variants, we extracted the sequence variants with their bi-directional 50-mer flanking sequences and confirmed that the sequence variants were detected in the flanking regions of the SP3B assembly using the in-house perl script.3. Results3.1. Sequencing, assembly, and repeat annotationWe obtained 15.0 and 11.6 Gb of whole-transcriptome sequences from H6 and SP3B by Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 101-bp paired-end reads (Supplementary Table S1). After preprocessing, a total of 10.1 and 7.9 Gb of sequences were remained for H6 and SP3B, respectively, and were used for de novo assembly (Supplementary Table S1). Using the combined library, a total of 203.0 Mb were assembled into 165,179 transcripts (mean length = 1,228.9 bp; N50 = 1,756 bp; Supplementary Table S2). The length distribution of the assembly showed that 76,699 transcripts (76.8% of the total) were longer than 1,000 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the assembly of the H6 and SP3B libraries separately produced 108,450 and 94,051 transcripts with an average length of 1,271.2 and 1,211.8 bp, respectively.To validate the three sets of assembled transcripts, we conducted BLASTN using 20,159 onion ESTs downloaded from GenBank, 18,393 (91.2%) of which were detected among the assembled transcripts from the combined library with 98% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, most (83.4%) of the ESTs were represented among the assembled transcripts with at least 98% sequence identity and 80% coverage. Additionally, we confirmed that most of the ESTs were matched and covered by the assemblies of the H6 and SP3B libraries using the same parameters (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C).Prior to structural gene prediction, we performed repeat masking using a constructed de novo repeat library made from the assembly of the combined library. A total of 38.9 Mb (19.2%) of the transcript sequences were determined to be TE-related repeats, including classified and unclassified repeats (Supplementary Table S3). A recent review reported that highly conserved and multicopy genes such as histone and tubulin can be recognized as repeat sequences during repeat masking.8 To avoid missing conserved protein-coding genes, we masked only the classified TEs including long interspersed nuclear elements, short interspersed nuclear elements, and long terminal repeats (LTRs) in the assembly of the combined library. In the assembly of the H6 and SP3B libraries, classified TEs were also masked to achieve optimal gene prediction for each assembly (Supplementary Table S3).3.2. Structural annotationProtein-coding genes in the transcriptome have mostly been predicted by classical methods such as six-frame translation of transcripts.17,27–33 That approach has been controversial, however, because of intermixed intron regions in the transcriptome. In order to predict more reliable gene sets, we established ISGAP to compare and integrate various gene-prediction approaches (Fig. 1). ISGAP comprises various gene-prediction approaches such as six-frame translation, evidence-based gene models based on protein mapping, ab initio gene prediction, and combined gene models.To structurally annotate the genes in the onion transcriptome, protein alignment of the assembled transcripts was carried out to detect gene structures (Fig. 1A). To extend the gene models extracted from the protein alignments using reference genes, we conducted additional translation for partial genes, which have no start or stop positions (Fig. 1A). Thus, 42,435 gene models containing 26,598 complete genes were generated using reference proteins for further analysis (Supplementary Table S4). After the construction of the training set of Augustus,46 51,092 gene models were predicted by Augustus and used to generate combined gene models with the gene models previously produced by Step 2 in ISGAP. Finally, 54,165 total genes and 20,447 representative protein-coding genes were annotated as a reference gene set of the onion after filtering against the NR database (Fig. 1A and Table 1). For the H6 and SP3B assemblies, we performed gene prediction using the same pipeline (Table 1). Additionally, to compare the gene models from ISGAP, six-frame translation was conducted as an independent step, and 65,645 genes were obtained (Fig. 1B and Table 2). The gene sets predicted by ISGAP showed a longer average length than those predicted by six-frame translation (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S4).

Validation and comparison of the gene models from ISGAP and six-frame translationTo evaluate the gene models predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation, we aligned the onion proteins in GenBank to the assembled transcripts. With over 90% mapping coverage, 398 of 511 (77.9%) of the onion proteins were detected among 1,008 regions in the assembled transcripts (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5). As a result, 348 and 281 genes predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively, covered 351 and 344 (88.2 and 86.4%) of the mapped onion proteins with over 99% query coverage. Moreover, 866 and 746 (85.9 and 74.0%) of the mapped regions were represented by the genes predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively (Supplementary Table S5).

For the black dotted line, the left and right of the histogram represent the numbers of covered query sequences and predicted genes, respectively. (A) Validation of the predicted gene sets using 511 onion proteins. (B) Assessment of the predicted proteins against the plant proteins in the RefSeq database.Although the reference onion proteins matched more of the genes predicted by ISGAP than those predicted by six-frame translation, it was difficult to evaluate whole annotated genes because of the small number of known onion proteins in GenBank. To validate the whole genes in the annotated gene sets intensively, we aligned the assembled transcripts to the plant proteins in the RefSeq database.48 A total of 49,257 RefSeq proteins were discovered among 126,607 regions in the assembled transcripts (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). Similar numbers of proteins were detected with over 99% query coverage in both the ISGAP (45,724) and the six-frame translation (44,448) libraries. The numbers of mapped regions and the corresponding genes were different, however, between the ISGAP and six-frame translation libraries (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). The 8,324 genes predicted by ISGAP covered 114,593 (90.5%) of the mapped regions, whereas the 6,526 genes predicted by six-frame translation covered 93,256 (73.7%) of the mapped regions, suggesting that the number of precisely annotated genes in the ISGAP library was substantially higher than that in the six-frame translation library (Fig. 2).To investigate differences between the gene sets, we selected and assessed all cases except both gene sets covered the same mapped regions in the validation results with 99% query coverage (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S5). For the onion reference proteins, 120 and 35 were represented by 94 and 27 gene annotations determined by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively (Fig. 2A). For the RefSeq proteins, 16,373 and 3,393 were represented by 2,341 and 543 gene annotations determined by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively (Fig. 2B). Although similar numbers of onion and RefSeq proteins were covered by genes from ISGAP and six-frame translation in the whole validation, the genes predicted by ISGAP in the extracted cases covered higher numbers of onion and RefSeq proteins, due to the fact that the same onion and RefSeq proteins were mapped in a different form on multiple transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S4A).3.4. Assessment of multiple exon genes and annotated gene structuresSome of the onion and RefSeq proteins were mapped as genes containing multiple exons (Supplementary Fig. S4A). To validate those genes, including the multiple exons, we identified the cases where the onion and RefSeq proteins were mapped as genes containing multiple exons in both of the validation results (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S5). In the validation using the onion proteins, 92 proteins were mapped onto 124 of the mapped regions (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5). For the proteins with over 99% query coverage, 23 genes predicted by ISGAP were represented by 78 (84.8%) of the onion proteins; however, the genes predicted by six-frame translation were not represented by any of the onion proteins (Fig. 2A). Moreover, 14,450 of the RefSeq proteins were detected among 24,719 of the mapped regions. With the same query coverage, 12,904 (89.3%) of the RefSeq proteins were correctly matched by 1,573 of the genes predicted by ISGAP (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). In contrast, only 6 (0.03%) of the RefSeq proteins were correctly matched by three of the genes predicted by six-frame translation (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). Rarely, the genes were fully matched to other RefSeq proteins mapped as single-exon genes (Supplementary Fig. S4B).Through the evaluation, we discovered miss-annotated genes derived from the six-frame translation. To verify the reasons for the miss-annotation, we examined the detailed structure of each gene model and identified representative cases among the validation results (Fig. 3). We found that the miss-annotations from the six-frame translation were caused by the retention of introns and the translation of the inappropriate region or strand (Fig. 3). For the corresponding regions, ISGAP successfully performed the gene annotations (Fig. 3). Hence, ISGAP could detect and extract accurate exon regions based on the structure of the reference protein and ab initio gene models, whereas six-frame translation could not. Representative cases of well-annotated genes predicted by ISGAP compared with the genes predicted by six-frame translation.

Functional annotation and transcriptomic variation for the construction of genomic resourcesTo date, the repertory of whole genes in the onion is unknown because of the absence of a reference genome. Therefore, we assigned functional information to the onion transcriptome based on the gene set predicted by ISGAP. We performed functional annotation using InterProScan version 5-46,47 containing Pfam, SMART, ProSite, and GO Term analysis. A total of 27,421 genes (50.6% of the total) were assigned functions based on the definitions of their domains (Supplementary Table S6). Among the annotated genes, the protein kinase domain was the most abundant and was detected in 1,283 genes (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the top 20 domains revealed the most actively expressed gene families in the onion (Fig. 4A). Distribution of biological functions and coverage graph for monocot and dicot plants.

The line graph and histogram illustrate the proportions of onion genes and plant proteins in each species, respectively.To provide a more specific functional description of the onion genes, we conducted a BLAST analysis using the Uniprot database. A total of 44,710 onion genes (82.5% of the total) were discovered based on their best alignment with an e-value cut-off of 1e-5 (Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, using the RefSeq database, we performed additional functional annotations for the genes that were unassigned by the Uniprot database, and a total of 50,352 genes (93.0% of the total) were discovered in Uniprot or RefSeq databases and assigned biological functions (Supplementary Table S6). The same functional annotation was performed for the H6 and SP3B gene sets (Supplementary Table S7 and S8).To estimate the coverage of the gene sets, we compared them to the proteins of each plant species in the RefSeq database via BLAST as an alternative approach to matching them with the whole genes of the onion. The predicted onion gene model covered from 60.5 to 68.0% of monocot proteins (Oryza branchyantha, Brachypodium distachyon, and Zea mays) and from 68.1 to 71.3% of dicot proteins (Vitis vinifera, Cucumis sativus, and Solanum lycopersicum) with cut-offs of 80% coverage and e-value of 1e-10 (Fig. 4B).To build up the genomic resources for molecular marker development in the onion, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis to detect sequence variation between H6 and SP3B. We identified a total 50,064 SNPs and 14,016 InDels between H6 and SP3B (Table 3). For efficient marker development, we removed the SNPs and INDELs that did not have conserved flanking sequences in the assembly of SP3B. Consequently, a total 5,502 SNPs within protein-coding sequences and 5,942 SNPs within non-coding sequences were identified (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S9).

DiscussionSince next-generation sequencing technology was developed, a large number of genomes have been sequenced from various organisms. Plants with very large genome sizes have not been fully sequenced because of features of the next-generation sequencing technology based on short reads. Because of the huge genome size of Allium spp., little genomic information has been deposited, creating an obstacle for the construction of an efficient molecular breeding platform. The emergence of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing offers an attractive solution for genomic studies of non-model organisms including the onion. Despite the advantages of transcriptome sequencing in terms of cost savings and reduced computing requirements, non-coding sequences in de novo transcriptomes have disrupted the construction of accurate genomic resources such as protein-coding gene libraries.25 Therefore, in-depth gene prediction for de novo transcriptome assembly is required to construct a fundamental reference gene set as an alternative genomic resource.Typically, the six-frame translation approach has been used to extract protein-coding genes from de novo transcriptome assemblies. Six-frame translation is based, however, on the concept that assembled transcripts are composed of purified coding sequences, despite the presence of non-coding sequences. We generated de novo transcriptome assemblies with annotated gene sets of two onion accessions using ISGAP, an automated pipeline, with intensive validation. We focused our attention on constructing ISGAP to optimize accurate gene prediction for de novo transcriptome assembly with multiple gene-prediction steps (Fig. 1A). As the key steps of ISGAP, protein alignment was integrated to detect accurate exon regions, and an additional translation step was applied to extend the partial genes based on the detected exon regions (Fig. 1A). In addition, gene prediction using Augustus with a training step was integrated to obtain genes for transcript regions without matching reference proteins (Fig. 1A).ISGAP predicted more genes accurately than six-frame translation did (Fig. 2), and it produced more specifically accurate reference genes (Fig. 2). The differences between the gene sets predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation were mainly caused by the existence or non-existence of introns within the assembled transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Due to the retained intron sequences, the correct annotation by six-frame translation was interrupted, leading to miss-annotation or the construction of partial genes. For genes containing multiple exons, ISGAP could recognize the intron sequences and merge the exons by removing the introns, despite the protein-coding genes being broken into at least two exons separated by intron sequences in the assembled transcripts (Fig. 3A and B). Six-frame translation could not correctly annotate the genes containing multiple exons (Figs 2 and 3A and B). In addition, for the single-exon genes, six-frame translation often extracted miss-annotated genes by translation with an inappropriate region or strand (Fig. 3C and D). The protein-coding genes in the transcriptome need to be extracted by the consideration of the gene structure, and ISGAP successfully performed annotation based on reference proteins and ab initio gene models.As shown in Fig. 4B, even if accurate comparison between the genes predicted by ISGAP and the plant proteins was difficult due to phylogenetic distance between the onion and the other plants, over 60% of the genes from each plant species were covered by half of the genes predicted by ISGAP with over 80% query coverage, suggesting that the gene set represented a large portion of the genes in the onion genome, although it was not enough to cover all of the genes in the onion. Nevertheless, transcriptome sequencing is still valuable for non-model organisms, owing to the absence of better alternative resources. The gene set predicted by ISGAP will contribute to the construction of a molecular breeding platform for the onion to boost the development of important traits such as shape, colour, size, pungency, and resistance to diseases. In conclusion, we expect that: (i) our comprehensive approach for accurate gene prediction using de novo transcriptome sequencing will provide a standard method for de novo transcriptome assembly in non-model organisms; (ii) the newly annotated gene set of the onion including various genomic resources such as SNPs and InDels will support molecular breeding and gene cloning in Allium spp.5.

IntroductionMicrosatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats, are tandem repeats of 1–6 bp motifs, which are ubiquitously found in eukaryotic genomes. One of the characteristic features of microsatellites is that they undergo rapid expansion or contraction in repeat number, leading to extensive length polymorphisms.1–5 Replication slippage is considered as the major cause of variation of microsatellite repeats.6–8 Slippage error creates a loop in one of the strands that gives rise to an insertion or a deletion in the subsequent replications, depending on the strand specificity (replicating or template strand) of loop formation. This leads to an increase or decrease of repeat length of the microsatellite. Several models have been proposed that explain the mutation processes of microsatellites.8–11 While the stepwise mutation model12 suggests that change in microsatellite loci occurs by one repeat unit at a time, study13 also shows that differential changes in the repeat number of microsatellites are associated with distinct probability under different mutational processes and demographic histories.It is well known that microsatellite loci are associated with an elevated rate of mutation that leads to abundant sequence polymorphisms of the repeats.14,15 Mutation in specific microsatellite loci often creates imperfect motifs,16 and they are generally referred to as imperfect microsatellites. Studies have shown that intra-allelic variability of microsatellites is significantly associated with selective force that maintains microsatellite loci in genome.17–21 In spite of the known facts that repeat variation of microsatellite loci is critical for their maintenance in the genome and in some cases may have functional consequences,18,22 our understanding of motif imperfection in microsatellites is very limited.11 In this study, we aim at understanding genome-wide patterns of motif mismatches among different insect species (n = 20) with a primary objective of investigating the relationship between microsatellite length and motif mismatches, and its role in genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites across species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencesThe genome sequences of insects investigated in this study include 15 species of order Diptera [12 Drosophilidae species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. grimshawi, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis) and 3 Culicidae species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus], 2 species of Hymenoptera (Nasonia vitripennis and Apis mellifera) and 1 species each of Lepidoptera (Bombyx mori), Coleoptera (Tribolium castaneum) and Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon pisum). Moreover, we also selected a few non-insect species, such as the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and the mammalian genomes of mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo sapiens) for specific comparative analyses. In addition, we analysed chromosome X sequences of 29 inbred lines of D. melanogaster from the DGRP (Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel; http://dgrp.gnets.ncsu.edu/) to investigate population-level sequence variation of imperfect microsatellites.The genome sequences of A. aegypti (AaegL1), A. gambiae (AgamP3) and C. quinquefasciatus (CpipJ1) were downloaded from https://www.vectorbase.org/. The genome sequences of the 12 Drosophila species were obtained from FlyBase (www.flybase.org). The assembly version of most of the 12 Drosophila genomes was r1.3 except D. melanogaster (r5.27), D. pseudoobscura (r2.10) and D. virilis (r1.2). The wasp (Nvit_1.0) and honey bee genome (Amel_2.0) sequences were downloaded from http://hymenopteragenome.org/. The aphid (v2.0), silkworm (v2.0) and beetle genome (tacs_superscaffolds v4.0) were obtained from http://www.aphidbase.com/, ftp://silkdb.org/pub/current/Genome/ and ftp://ftp.bioinformatics.ksu.edu/, respectively. The four non-insect genome sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome server (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/currentGenomes/). The assembly versions were yeast (SacCer_Apr2011), roundworm (WS220/ce10), mouse (GRCm38/mm10) and human (hg19, GRCh37). For the insect species, the names have been abbreviated as the first letter of the genus followed by three letters of the species name throughout the text and illustrations.2.2. Identification of imperfect microsatellitesThe imperfect microsatellites were identified from the genome assemblies using the SciRoKo 3.4 program, employing the approach that implemented fixed penalty motif mismatch criteria.23 The minimum score 15 and mismatch penalty 5 were used as search criteria to identify imperfect microsatellites of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats in each species. We also used slightly different parameters such as a minimum score of 15 and mismatch penalty of 3, and a minimum score of 10 and mismatch penalty of 5 to search microsatellites to investigate whether changes in parameter values affected the results of this study. In none of the searches, more than three consecutive mismatches per locus were allowed to identify the imperfect microsatellites.2.3. Motif mismatches and microsatellite lengthThe number of imperfect microsatellites along with their length and number of mismatches of individual locus, as predicted by SciRoKo, were used for different comparative analyses among the species. The genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites with different length and motif mismatches was chosen for different comparative analyses. First, we targeted microsatellites of length <30 bp for comparison between perfect (no mismatch) and imperfect repeats (each containing exactly one mismatch) in each genome. Here, microsatellites of length 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 bp were identified in genome-wide manner in each species. Note that microsatellites of length <20 bp are not appropriate for this analysis as they are always perfect under our search conditions. Similarly, microsatellites above 25 bp in length may have two mismatches as per our search conditions. Second, we targeted longer microsatellites (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 bp) to compare repeats that have different number (1, 2, 4 or 6) of mismatches. The third comparison was made between microsatellites that were at least 30 bp long and had <3 or =3 mismatches (note that microsatellites <30 bp canno't have more than three mismatches as per our search conditions). Selected non-insect species, such as the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae), the roundworm (C. elegans) and the mammalian genomes of mouse (M. musculus) and human (H. sapiens), were also analysed in genome-wide manner in a similar manner.2.4. Generalized discriminant analysis between perfect and imperfect loci across speciesThe generalized discriminant analysis was performed using the principal coordinates method.24 The variation of frequency of perfect microsatellites and microsatellites that have same number of mismatches across the 20 species were decomposed into the principal coordinates. Then they were tested by permutation to determine if the variation was significant between perfect and imperfect repeats. First, distance matrices were generated separately from the frequency data of both groups of loci across species. They were then decomposed into component eigenvalues by the principal coordinate analysis. The canonical axes scores (position of multivariate points on the canonical axes) were then used to determine correlations between variables, and the statistical significance of the correlation was inferred from permutation procedure implemented in the program named ‘canonical analysis of principal coordinates’ (available at https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~mja/Programs.htm).2.5. Permutational analysis of variance and pair-wise a posteriori comparisonThe permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)25 was used to determine association between the number of mismatches and the length of microsatellites among the 20 species. The Euclidean distance was used as the measure of data variation. The pair-wise a posteriori comparisons were performed between different lengths of microsatellites (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 bp containing 1, 2, 4 or 6 mismatches) among the 20 insect species as well as among the 4 non-insect species using PERMANOVA t-statistic. No data transformation or standardization was done prior to analysis. Unrestricted permutation of the data was allowed to perform the permutation tests (9,999 times) to determine the statistical significance of the analysis. The P-value of <0.05 was considered as the threshold of significance, unless stated otherwise.2.6. Identification and analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms localized within imperfect microsatellitesWe identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are localized within microsatellite loci in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae from the NCBI SNP database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). The microsatellites were partitioned to either as M1 types if the SNP alleles matched to the imperfect motif sequences or as M0 types if SNP alleles did not match to the motif sequences. To determine the significance of association of M0/M1 allelic patterns with variation of motif mismatches of imperfect microsatellites, microsatellites containing either <3 mismatches or =3 mismatches were determined in each species with repeat length being controlled (=30 bp) for each locus. The count data of these four groups of imperfect microsatellites were used in 2 × 2 contingency tests (Yates' chi-square) to determine statistical significance of association between allelic variation and motif imperfection of microsatellites.2.7. Analysis of imperfect microsatellites from DGRP dataTo further investigate the role of mutations in motif mismatches and to estimate the allele age of imperfect microsatellite loci, we analysed genome sequences of D. melanogaster inbred lines from the DGRP data.26 We restricted this analysis only to microsatellite sequences of chromosome X among 29 randomly selected inbred lines. A comprehensive analysis of the microsatellites in the entire DGRP was not an aim of the present study because such a study has been performed earlier.27 Mutations in the microsatellites among the inbred lines were identified by sequence alignment with the reference genome. The imperfect microsatellite data (from DGRP lines) were used as a training dataset to classify the data of imperfect microsatellites generated from the dbSNP by linear regression using Weka Explorer.28The phylogenetic analyses were conducted using D. melanogaster imperfect microsatellite loci from different inbred lines. The sequence of each locus was extended up to 1 kb of both ends of microsatellite and the extended sequences were used to calculate evolutionary distances among the inbred lines using the maximum composite likelihood implemented in MEGA4.29 The neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA4 was used for constructing phylogenetic trees. The total number of mutations, number of polymorphic sites, average number of nucleotide differences and the number of fixed mutations between inbred lines were calculated by using DnaSP v 5.10.30 The allele age of microsatellite SNPs was calculated based on allele frequency and polymorphisms among the inbred lines in the extended sequences of microsatellites by the coalescence method.17 The coalescence times were predicted by using a maximum likelihood approach implemented in the algorithm ‘bdmc21’ (available at http://www.rannala.org/).3. Results3.1. Frequency of imperfect microsatellites in insect genomesThe number of imperfect microsatellites varies among the insect species as given in Table 1. The imperfect repeats account to ~15–46% of all simple sequence repeats identified from the genome sequences of the 20 insect species. The imperfect microsatellites represented <1% of the genome size of most of these insects except few Drosophila species (Fig. 1). The data in Table 1 and Fig. 1 show that species even within the Drosophila genus have extensive variation in the frequency of imperfect microsatellites. It was observed that specific Drosophila species (such as D. mojavensis, D. virilis and D. grimshawi) have a higher amount of imperfect microsatellites than other insects. Moreover, our data show that the imperfect microsatellites are differentially distributed among different chromosomes within the genome (Supplementary Table S1). This was evident in insects where chromosomes have been annotated from genome assemblies. It was observed that chromosome X harbours the highest proportion of imperfect microsatellites in D. melanogaster, a pattern that was also found in D. simulans and D. yakuba. However, this pattern is missing in non-Drosophila insects such as A. gambiae and T. castaneum (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, the proportion of imperfect microsatellites varies differentially among species depending on the motif length of microsatellites (Supplementary Table S2). The di- and trinucleotide repeats are associated with an elevated rate of motif mismatches compared with all other repeat sizes. Moreover, this pattern seems to be a conserved feature across the insect genomes.

Motif mismatches and microsatellite lengthThe mean length of imperfect microsatellites is higher than that of perfect microsatellites in each species (Supplementary Table S3). To understand the relationship between microsatellite length and motif imperfection, we identified microsatellites of different lengths (20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 bp) that either lack mismatch (perfect motifs) or have exactly one mismatch in each locus. The generalized discriminant analysis24 was conducted to determine the significance of variation between perfect and imperfect microsatellites across the genomes. Results of this analysis showed a significant relationship (first squared canonical correlation = 0.9024, P = 0.0001) between perfect and imperfect microsatellites among the species, wherein the imperfect microsatellites of different lengths revealed lower canonical variation than that of the perfect microsatellites in each species (Fig. 2).

The scatter graph on the right shows the canonical variation of frequency of microsatellites of different length for each species. The species are indicated as 1 through 20 on x-axis and the canonical variation is shown in y-axis.Then to know if the extent of motif mismatches is related to microsatellite length, we determined the frequency of microsatellites of different lengths (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 bp) harbouring different numbers of mismatches (1, 2, 4 and 6) in each of 20 species (Supplementary Table S4). The length and mismatch criteria were selected based on the search parameters as described above. The dataset was then used to perform permutational multifactorial analysis of variance of mismatch numbers and length of microsatellites. Results of this analysis showed that both the factors (length and mismatches) have significant association with the variation of genomic frequency of microsatellites among the species (F = 2.6, P = 0.02 for length and F = 45.02, P = 0.001 for mismatch). This suggested that genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites may have an evolutionary link with the extent of sequence heterogeneity of repeat motifs across species. Moreover, it was also observed that genomic frequency of the microsatellites having only one mismatch correlates better with that of loci harbouring two mismatches than loci having four or six mismatches (Table 2). This again supported for a possible link between genomic frequency and extent of motif imperfection of microsatellites. Pearson correlation of frequency of imperfect microsatellites.

The microsatellite lengths are shown in bp in the first column. The frequencies of microsatellites having 1 mismatch are compared with that of microsatellites having 2, 4 or 6 mismatches among the 20 insect species3.3. Motif heterogeneity and genomic abundance of microsatellitesTo further understand the relationship between motif heterogeneity and genomic abundance of microsatellites, we performed the following analyses. First, we calculated the expected number of mismatches in each imperfect microsatellite from the average rate of per-site mismatch (sum of mismatches divided by the sum of loci lengths) in individual genomes. Then for each imperfect microsatellite, the expected number of mismatches (repeat length multiplied with per-site mismatches) was calculated and compared with the observed number of mismatches in the loci. The results of this comparison showed that microsatellites that carry a higher amount of mismatches than expected are significantly related (Spearman r = 0.938, df = 19, P = 0.000001) with microsatellites that carry a lower amount of mismatches than expected across the species (Table 3). The former group of microsatellites consistently showed lower frequency in the genome than the latter group, indicating that genomic frequency of microsatellites is negatively influenced by motif heterogeneity of the repeats. Number of microsatellites where motif mismatches are either higher or lower than the expected values of mismatches in different insect genomesNumber of microsatellites where motif mismatches are either higher or lower than the expected values of mismatches in different insect genomesTo further confirm that genomic abundance of microsatellites is associated with motif mismatches of microsatellites, we performed PERMANOVA25 test among different groups of motif mismatches (1, 2, 4 and 6 mismatches) of microsatellites among species (Supplementary Table S4). The results of this analysis revealed that the relationship between higher mismatches and lower genomic abundance of microsatellites is statistically significant (P = 0.0001). The pair-wise a posteriori comparison between microsatellites of different lengths showed that the significance level of association of genomic abundance varies differentially across the insect species based on the length of microsatellites (Supplementary Table S4). These results clearly suggested that microsatellite abundance in genome is intricately related to sequence imperfection of motifs and the length of the microsatellites across species.We also compared microsatellites by controlling the length and number of motif mismatches of microsatellites across the species. Here, we restricted the comparison among loci that are at least 30 bp in length and have either <3 or =3 mismatches. These length and mismatch criteria were selected based on our search parameters as described in the Materials and methods section. The result of this analysis also revealed that loci that have less than three mismatches are more prevalent in the genome than those with three or more number of mismatches (Supplementary Table S5). This pattern was consistent not only in the insect species, but also in other unrelated species such as yeast, roundworm, mouse and human (Supplementary Table S5).We also wanted to confirm that our observations were not influenced by the search parameters we used to identify the microsatellites. To test that, we used different parameters such as minimum score 15 and mismatch penalty 3 or minimum score of 10 and mismatch penalty 5 to search microsatellites in specific genomes. When data of these searches were used to repeat the analyses described above, we still found that microsatellites with higher mismatches tend to have lower prevalence in the genome (data not shown). This confirmed that the link between sequence imperfection and microsatellite abundance is a robust evolutionary process and is not influenced by the search parameters of microsatellites.3.4. Mutation and imperfection of motif sequencesTo investigate role of mutation in motif imperfection, SNPs localized within microsatellite loci were identified from the dbSNP database (see Materials and methods). Then, we identified loci where motif mismatches corresponded to the alternate alleles of the cognate SNP (Fig. 3). These were referred to as M1 microsatellites. We also found microsatellites where motif mismatches did not correspond to the SNP alleles (Fig. 3). These were referred to as M0 microsatellites. The microsatellites with different numbers of mismatches (=3 or <3 mismatches) and having either M0 or M1 allele patterns were identified in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae (Supplementary Table S6). The number of mismatches (=3 or <3) was particularly chosen as 1) microsatellites <30 bp in length are predominant in both genomes, and 2) loci that are <30 bp have less than three mismatches as per our search conditions. The count data of microsatellites, based on the number of motif mismatches and pattern of allelic variation (M0 or M1), were analysed by Yates' chi-squared test. The result of this analysis revealed significant (<U+03C7>2 = 315.5, P < 0.0001) association between allele sequences of SNPs and mismatch patterns of microsatellites in D. melanogaster. A similar result was observed in A. gambiae where the association was also statistically significant (<U+03C7>2 = 13.6, P = 0.0002). Taken together, these findings show that patterns of allelic changes of microsatellites have a significant role in modulating the number of motif mismatches of imperfect microsatellites.

Insights from population dataWe also analysed sequences of imperfect microsatellites of multiple inbred lines (n = 29) of D. melanogaster (DGRP data) to understand within-species variation of motif sequences of imperfect microsatellite loci. We identified a total of 118,446 imperfect microsatellites from the chromosome X sequences of the 29 inbred lines of D. melanogaster (Supplementary Table S7). Of these, a total of 1,025 loci showed polymorphic microsatellites (Fig. 4). We used the allele sequences and motif mismatch patterns of these 1,025 microsatellites to train the imperfect microsatellites identified from dbSNP data. Linear regression-based data classification of SNP allelic variation (M0 versus M1) and the corresponding motif mismatch patterns of microsatellites were performed using Weka3.6.28 The results of these analyses revealed a significant relationship (P < 0.05) between allele variation and motif mismatches of imperfect microsatellites, and also showed that for accumulation of a single M1 type of mutation, the number of repeat mismatches in the microsatellite decreases by 56%. This further confirmed that pattern of allelic variation plays a major role in motif heterogeneity of microsatellites.

The reference SNP identified in D. melanogaster (dbSNP data) is shown by a downward arrow along with SNP ID and alleles.We also estimated the age of specific alleles of imperfect microsatellites based on the population data (DGRP). First, we identified flanking mutations (within 1 kb on both ends) of microsatellites that were in complete linkage with segregating mutation within the microsatellite (Supplementary Fig. S1). Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis, the extended sequences showed differential genealogical relations among the inbred lines (Fig. 5). We determined the number of fixed mutations, total number of variable sites and the average number of nucleotide differences in the extended sequences of imperfect microsatellites (Supplementary Table S8). Based on the allele frequency of mutations within and the flanking sequences of the imperfect microsatellite, we predicted generation times that might have lapsed since the origin of the mutation in the microsatellite. The maximum likelihood method17 was used for making this prediction from the joint distribution of the number of copies in the population and the coalescence times of the intra-allelic variation. The results revealed that the maximum likelihoods varied between 1,380 and 1,530 generations (Fig. 6). Assuming 36 days as the average generation time of D. melanogaster, it was thus estimated that these alleles might have arisen 136–150 yrs ago.

DiscussionThe results obtained from this study provide insights into sequence imperfection of microsatellite motifs in a genome-wide manner. We chose insect genomes for this investigation as microsatellites have been extensively exploited as molecular markers in ecology and population studies of numerous insect species,31 yet the imperfect microsatellites of insects remain poorly understood. As studies on evolution of microsatellites are gaining renewed attention with the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing and whole-genome sequences,32–39 the present study was initiated as an effort to gain insights into the motif mismatch patterns of microsatellites of insects as well as specific non-insect eukaryotes. In this investigation, imperfect microsatellites were computationally identified from the draft genome sequences of the chosen species by SciRoko.23 Apart from SciRoKo, other computational algorithms such as IMEx, NWISL and Phobos are also available to identify imperfect microsatellites40 (http://ssr.nwisrl.ars.usda.gov/ and www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ecoevo/cm/cm_phobos.htm). However, comparing the efficacy of different algorithms in detecting imperfect microsatellites was not the aim of this study. We analysed each genome using the same tool (SciRoKo) and the same parameters appropriate for data comparison across genomes. The genome-wide search of microsatellites in insect species by SciRoKo revealed that the proportion of microsatellites with imperfect motifs varies from species to species even within the same genus. The 12 Drosophila species clearly represent that pattern (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Earlier study has shown that microsatellite abundance diverges rapidly between Drosophila species, and that considerable variation in the relative abundance of motif size classes exists between species.41 Moreover, differential association of microsatellites with coding sequences of Drosophila genome may impose differential constraint on microsatellite abundance between species. In fact, the number of microsatellites associated with coding sequences varies extensively among the 12 Drosophila genomes as shown from the previous study.36 At the same time, it is possible that the quality of genome assembly may affect identification of microsatellites comprehensively. However, the 20 insect genomes we analysed represented different qualities of genome assemblies of the insect species. Yet, our results showed highly consistent patterns in microsatellite imperfections across species (Supplementary Table S4), indicating that the results of this study are not affected by differences in assembly quality of the genomes.We found that sex chromosomes tend to have elevated frequency of imperfect microsatellites than autosomes in Drosophila species. It is likely that differential association of microsatellites with coding sequences of different chromosomes may impose differential constraint on non-random prevalence of imperfect microsatellites within the genome. These coding repeats may be under differential selection pressure in the genome. It is known that repeats representing amino acid runs in Drosophila are under positive selection.34 Furthermore, in D. melanogaster, the adaptive evolution proceeds more quickly in X than autosomes.42 This is commonly referred to as the faster-X hypothesis. Such X bias adaptive evolution is associated with a number of phenotypic, morphological and behavioural changes in the fly.43 As sex chromosomes in Drosophila have elevated frequency of imperfect microsatellites than autosomes, the possibility of coding microsatellites playing a role in faster X evolution of Drosophila genome canno't be ruled out. Furthermore, our earlier study has shown that the trinucleotide repeats represent the highest fraction of codon repeats in insects.36 From the current study, we also observe that trinucleotide microsatellites show higher variation in motif imperfect than other motif sizes in several insects including D. melanogaster (Supplementary Table S2). It is likely that rapid variation of codon repeats in chromosome X may cause faster adaptive evolution of genes localized in X chromosome than autosomes. However, it is unlikely that such a mechanism is operational in all insect species. This is because no evidence of elevated frequency of imperfect microsatellites in chromosome X compared with autosomes was observed in the non-Drosophila species we investigated.We further observed that microsatellite length and the extent of motif imperfection are significantly associated with the genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites. Previously, it has been shown that longer microsatellites (>15 repeats) are associated with mutational bias that reduces the length of microsatellites.44 Hence, the older mutations are more likely to be deleted from the longer microsatellites, causing a paucity of long microsatellites in the genome. Although the length of microsatellites is known to have a role in the mutational activities of microsatellites,45,46 results from the current investigation show that sequence imperfection of motifs is a key determinant of abundance of imperfect microsatellites in the genome. Such an evolutionary link is not specific to insects, but is also observed in unrelated eukaryotes including yeast, worm and mammals. Consistent with this theory, the perfect microsatellites are found more abundantly than the imperfect microsatellites in each genome (Table 1). Moreover, it is known that mutations in microsatellite alleles shorter than a critical length favour repeat expansion, whereas mutations acting on longer alleles favour contraction of microsatellite repeats.47 The intricacies between length and sequence mismatches may also be critical in maintaining imperfect repeats in the genome.21 This is also indicated from comparison of genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites among insect species based on different lengths of microsatellites (Supplementary Table S4). The posterior t-test P-values were significant for all the pair-wise comparisons among the 20 insect species. We, however, failed to observe such relationships among the non-insect species most probably due to the sample size (only four) used for analysis. Also, the large differences in the genome sequences of these species (worm, yeast, human and mouse) may account for the lack of significant relationships in imperfect microsatellites in the genomes.Recently, many inbred lines of D. melanogaster were sequenced that generated a very useful resource of genetic variation data of fruit fly, and also provided new insights on the faster X hypothesis.26 We used these data to identify imperfect microsatellites in multiple inbred lines. The data were used to classify the reference SNP alleles (dbSNP data) of imperfect microsatellites to understand how mutation affects sequence imperfection in microsatellites. The results of that analysis suggested that there is a significant relationship between motif imperfection and mutational patterns in the microsatellite loci. Our data showed that the extent of motif heterogeneity of imperfect microsatellites is significantly linked to the nature of allelic changes in microsatellites. When a new allele is introduced that differs in sequence from that of existing mismatches in the microsatellite, the extent of sequence heterogeneity increases. On the other hand, when the introduced alleles match to the pre-existing motif mismatches, it does no't affect the motif heterogeneity for which the locus is more likely to be maintained in the genome than a locus where motif heterogeneity builds up by mutation. If mutations continue in a microsatellite wherein the introduced alleles build up motif heterogeneity, over time the locus eventually becomes a non-microsatellite sequence. Our result shows that, depending on the introduced allele sequences, a single mutation can reduce motif mismatches by 56%. It is plausible that this relationship may be instrumental in regulating the overall slippage events of simple sequence repeats in the genome.In D. melanogaster, we further observed that imperfect microsatellites are also localized within specific protein-coding genes (Fig. 5). The microsatellite-associated SNP rs204392359 is localized in the intron of gene stardust (sdt). Similarly, the SNP rs205546548 is localized within a microsatellite in downstream region of gene trf2 (TATA box-binding protein-related factor 2), and the SNP rs204306547 is localized within an intronic microsatellite of the gene CG3655. Furthermore, we estimated that alleles of these microsatellites originated within the last 150 yrs, suggesting that these imperfect microsatellites may be undergoing recent mutations in D. melanogaster. It is possible that these imperfect microsatellite and the associated mutations have a functional role in D. melanogaster, as increasing evidence now suggests that microsatellites are associated with functional and evolutionary roles in eukaryotic genomes.14,48 Moreover, in A. gambiae genome, numerous protein-coding genes harbour mutation in microsatellite sequences within the respective genes (Supplementary Table S9), indicating that motif imperfection of microsatellites may have extensive functional consequences in A. gambiae.In conclusion, the current study is the first detailed investigation of imperfect microsatellites in insect species representing five taxonomic orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera). The results obtained from this investigation provide new insights into the evolution of sequence imperfection in microsatellite loci across genomes. The outcome of this study may have utility in assessing the role of motif imperfection of microsatellites in genome structure and function of insects.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.orgFundingThis work was supported from grants RO1-AI079125-A1, RO1-AI081795 and R21-AI101345 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, USA.

IntroductionGenetic linkage maps are essential for the understanding of genomic levels of organization of inheritance of traits.1 Construction of high-density and high-resolution genetic maps is a key step for fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and marker-assisted selection. In addition, genetic linkage maps are valuable resources for the generation of chromosome-level assembly of whole-genome sequences and for comparative genome analysis.2 In most of the recent whole-genome sequencing cases, whole-genome sequences are generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Short sequence reads are assembled into contigs. Such contigs are generally still relatively short although they vary in sizes from several kilobases to tens of kilobases. Increases in genome sequencing coverage and sequencing libraries can increase the quality of the assembly, allowing the sizes of contigs to be increased. However, NGS methods alone cannot provide the resources to assemble complex genomes at the chromosomal level. Genome sequence assemblies at this level require the assembly of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of contigs.Highly segmented genome assemblies prohibit efficient genome analysis. Therefore, various genome resources have been created to reduce the segmentation of the genome assemblies. One of these resources is the large-insert-based physical maps. Historically, several types of large insert libraries have been used. These include yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs),3 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs),4 and cosmid-based libraries.5 YACs have the largest capacity for cloning the large inserts, but they are relatively unstable; therefore, their use in genome studies has been limited. Cosmid libraries have the smallest capacity for cloning the large inserts; therefore, their use in large insert libraries has also been limited. BACs are the most popular large insert libraries as they are stable and can hold inserts of up to 200 kb. BAC-based physical maps can organize the entire genome into restriction fingerprint-based contigs. Such contigs are similar to the whole-genome sequencing contigs, but they are constructed using overlapping restriction enzyme fingerprints rather than overlapping sequences themselves for the whole-genome sequence assemblies. By analysis of restriction fingerprints of overlapping genomic clones of BAC inserts, the whole genome can be organized into a limited number of contigs, most often in thousands. For instance, the catfish physical maps had 3,307 contigs and 1,891 contigs.6,7 The integrated catfish physical map included over 2,500 contigs (unpublished).Integration of physical maps and whole-genome sequence contigs allows the relationship to be established between the sequence-based contigs and the restriction fingerprint-based contigs, thereby reducing the levels of segmentation of the genome. One of the major applications of genetic linkage map is to integrate physical maps and whole-genome assemblies. Integration of genetic map with physical map is useful for understanding genomes from different dimensions and is essential for comparative genome analysis,8 fine-scale QTL mapping and positional cloning of genes responsible for performance and production traits.9,10 In aquaculture fish species, genetic maps have been constructed in a few species, such as Asian seabass,11 Atlantic salmon,12 half-smooth tongue sole,13 rainbow trout,14 common carp,15 and catfish.2,9,16,17 These maps harbour several hundred to a couple of thousands of markers, with which QTL for agriculturally important performance and production traits can only be mapped in large genomic regions.Integrated maps have been developed in several aquaculture fish species using low-density genetic maps. In Atlantic salmon, in addition to 579 BAC contigs that were integrated into the linkage map using microsatellite markers, identification and mapping of new BAC-anchored single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from BAC-end sequences placed 73 additional BAC contigs to Atlantic salmon linkage groups.18 The second generation of rainbow trout integrated map anchored up to 265 contigs to the genetic map, covering ~11% of the genome.10 In common carp, a total of 463 physical map contigs and 88 single BACs were integrated into the genetic linkage map, which covered 30% of the common carp genome.15 In catfish, 2,030 BAC-end sequence (BES)-derived microsatellites from 1,481 physical map contigs were used for linkage map construction, which anchored 44.8% of the catfish BAC physical map contigs, covering ~52.8% of the genome.9 Apparently, the level of integration is dependent on the density and resolution of the genetic maps.One objective of this study was to construct a high-density and high-resolution genetic linkage map by using a large number of molecular markers, covering the entire genome and a large resource panel for linkage mapping analysis. In addition to this primary goal, a secondary goal was to increase integration of the linkage and physical maps, using markers derived from BECs for genetic linkage analysis. Our previous genetic linkage analysis used mostly microsatellite markers. In spite of their high polymorphism, and low cost of single marker genotyping, an analysis of tens of thousands of microsatellites with a large number of mapping fish is extremely labourious and cost-prohibitive. SNPs overcome these difficulties by providing high efficiency and low-cost, large-scale genotyping. SNPs have become markers of choice because of their abundance, even genomic distribution, and easy adaptation to automation.19 Recent advances in NGS have allowed rapid discovery of genome-wide SNPs in any organism in a cost-effective manner.20 With the availability of large numbers of SNPs, high-density SNP array platform can be developed for high-throughput and efficient genotyping. Alternatively, an NGS-based genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)19–21 is also highly efficient. SNP arrays and GBS have both been used to genotype large-scale SNPs for genetic mapping and association analyses.12,22–28 Compared with GBS, SNP arrays are more cost-effective. In addition, they provide a greater level of genome coverage. For instance, in most cases, the total number of commonly analysed SNPs is limited to several thousands while millions of SNPs can be analysed by using very high-density SNP arrays. In addition, GBS of large resource panels for high-resolution maps is cost-prohibitive.Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, is the primary aquaculture species in the United States. Since the initiation of genome research over two decades ago, several genetic maps have been constructed with different types of molecular markers and various resource families.2,9,16,17 Up to date, the highest density map was developed to contain 2,030 microsatellites and 100 SNPs.9 Although this genetic map has been very useful for genetic and genomic analysis,29,30 marker density in this map was still fairly low and only facilitated integration to the physical map for ~52% of catfish genome. Recently, following efforts to expand catfish genomic resources, we have identified millions of SNPs in channel catfish31,32 and developed high-density SNP arrays,33 which provided the opportunity to develop a high-density and high-resolution SNP-based genetic map. Here we report the construction of genetic linkage map with over 50,000 SNPs in channel catfish, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest density genetic map for any aquaculture species. Along with the high density of markers, the utilization of BAC-associated SNPs also allowed significant increase of the integration of the genetic linkage map with the BAC-based physical map in catfish, allowing over 90% of the catfish genome physical map contigs to be mapped to linkage groups. This genetic map should serve as a valuable framework for validating the reference whole-genome sequences, extensive comparative and functional genomic studies, and fine-scale QTL mapping and association studies in catfish.2. Materials and methods2.1. Resource families and DNA preparationA total of 576 fish, with 192 full-sibling individuals from each of three full-sibling channel catfish families, were used for linkage mapping. The parent and grandparent samples were also obtained. All DNAs for these samples used in this study were provided by USDA-ARS Warmwater Aquaculture Research Unit, which were prepared following the procedures as previously described.172.2. SNP genotypingDNA samples were arranged in 96-well microtitre plates and diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/µl with the final volume of 10 µl. Genotyping was conducted by GeneSeek (Lincoln, NE, USA) using the catfish 250K SNP array.33 Affymetrix CEL files were analysed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software (version 4.0) for quality control analysis and SNP genotype calling using the Affymetrix AxiomGT1 algorithm. Samples passing the quality control (Dish value > 0.85) and SNP call rates threshold (>95%) were retained for analysis. Following genotyping, an R package, SNPolisher, was used to generate the genotyping outputs. The package produced SNP quality control metrics and divided SNPs into several classes based on the quality of genotype calls.33 The polymorphic markers with high resolution of cluster separation (high genotyping quality) were remained for further analysis. The CHP files generated from the Affymetrix Genotyping Console were imported into SNP & Variation Suite (SVS version 7, Golden Helix, Inc.) for further filtering to remove SNPs with missing genotypes >10% and minor allele frequency <5%.2.3. Linkage map constructionOnly SNPs that had high quality of genotype calls and were heterozygous in at least one parent were retained for linkage analysis. Based on segregation patterns, SNPs were categorized into three types: 1 : 2 : 1 type (AB × AB, segregating in both parents), 1 : 1 type (AB × AA or AB × BB, segregating only in female), and 1 : 1 type (AA × AB or BB × AB, segregating only in male). The <U+03C7>2 goodness-of-fit tests were performed to examine the segregation distortion. Markers with significant segregation distortion were excluded (P < 0.001).Linkage maps were initially developed independently for the three mapping families. Sex-specific maps were constructed for each parent using 1 : 1 segregation-type markers only (AB × AA or AB × BB for female map and AA × AB or BB × AB for male map). The markers of segregation type 1 : 2 : 1 (AB × AB) were used to build the sex-averaged map. The LINKMFEX software (version 2.4, http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rdanzman/software.htm) was used to perform linkage analysis for sex-specific markers, and OneMap (R package, version 2.0) was used for linkage analysis of sex-averaged markers. Linkage between markers was examined by estimating logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for recombination fraction (<U+03B8>). A LOD threshold of 8.0 was used, and a maximum <U+03B8> of 0.35 was set to assign markers into linkage groups.For markers falling into ‘zero recombination clusters', only one marker was picked that had the most informative meiosis as the representative marker of each cluster for linkage map construction to reduce the power required for computation of linkage. Genetic maps were constructed using JoinMap software version 4.0 with the regression mapping algorithm.34 The Kosambi mapping function was used to convert the recombination frequencies into map distances (centiMorgans). The positions of markers were determined according to the sequential build-up of the map.35 Briefly, a pair of markers was firstly selected, followed by sequential addition of other markers. The ‘ripple’ was performed each time after adding one marker. The best fitting position of the added markers was searched based on the goodness-of-fit test for the resulting map. When a marker generated a negative map distance or a large ‘jump’ value in goodness-of-fit test, the marker was removed, and map calculation was continued to construct a first-round map. Thereafter, the removed markers were added to the first-round map and again subjected to the goodness-of-fit test to generate an optimum order of markers. For the sex-specific markers, the linkage phases were inferred automatically, while for the markers with 1 : 2 : 1 segregation type (AB × AB), the linkage phase was deduced based on the genotypes of grandparents to assist the map construction.The consensus maps were then established using the MergeMap36 by integrating individual maps from three reference families through shared markers. Lastly, the markers falling into ‘zero recombination clusters’ that were excluded during map construction were anchored to the linkage map, based on the positions of their corresponding representative markers. All genetic linkage maps were drawn using MAPCHART 2.2.372.4. Differences in recombination rates between families and sexesTo investigate sex-specific heterogeneity throughout each linkage group, common marker pairs were used to compare the locus intervals across the male-specific map and female-specific map using contingency G-test.392.5. Integration of linkage map with physical mapTo integrate previously developed physical map40 with the high-density linkage map constructed in the present work, all the mapped SNPs with 70-bp flanking sequences were aligned with BES8,40 and BAC-based physical map contig-specific sequences (PMCSS)41 using BLAST with the E-value cut-off 1E-10, minimal alignment length of 36, and minimal identity of 95%. The relationship of physical map and genetic map was built up based on the SNP-associated BES and PMCSS. The BAC physical map contigs that harboured BAC-derived BES and PMCSS were anchored onto the genetic map based on the SNP positions.3. Results3.1. Selection of SNP markersAs summarized in Table 1, SNP genotypes were obtained from 576 samples of three mapping families (192 samples per family). According to the assessment of genotyping quality and polymorphism in all samples from the three mapping families, genotypes of a total of 121,521 SNPs were used (Table 1). Owing to the low genotype calling rate (<95%), nine individuals were excluded for analysis, including one individual from family 1, three individuals from family 2, and five individuals from family 3. After further filtering to remove SNPs with low calling rate (<97%) and non-Mendelian inheritance (P < 0.001), a total of 18,866 SNPs from family 1, 33,224 SNPs from family 2, and 35,093 SNPs from family 3 were retained for linkage mapping. Taken together, a total of 64,889 SNPs that were informative in at least one of the three mapping families were used. SNPs selected for linkage mappingSNPs selected for linkage mapping3.2. Linkage mappingLinkage maps were first constructed for each of the three families, separately. For all three mapping families, 29 linkage groups (LGs) were obtained, which was consistent with the number of chromosomes of the catfish haploid genome. The consensus genetic linkage maps were obtained by merging separate maps from three mapping families. A total of 31,387 markers with distinct genetic positions (hereafter referred to as unique markers) were placed on the consensus linkage maps, which included 8,644 SNPs from family 1, 13,477 SNPs from family 2, and 14,343 SNPs from family 3 (Table 2). After anchoring the previously excluded markers that fell into ‘zero recombination clusters’ based on the genetic positions of representative markers, a total of 54,342 SNP markers were placed onto the current linkage map (Table 2). SNPs placed on the linkage mapsSNPs placed on the linkage mapsThe sex-specific maps were constructed using markers that were heterozygous in only female or male parent. The female genetic map consisted of 18,444 SNPs including 9,746 unique markers, with a total genetic length of 4,495.1 cM (Table 3; Fig. 1). The marker intervals estimated based on the unique marker positions ranged from 0.37 cM/marker pair in LG12 to 0.7 cM/marker pair in LG18 with the average marker interval of 0.46 cM/marker pair in female genetic map. The male genetic map comprised 15,148 SNPs with 7,250 unique markers and a total genetic length of 2,593.7 cM, which was much shorter than female genetic map. The marker intervals of male genetic map ranged from 0.25 cM/marker pair (LG18) to 0.55 cM/marker pair (LG1), with an average marker interval of 0.36 cM (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be noted that these distances refer to intervals where recombination was detected and of course it should be recognized that in both sexes, the minimum distance observed was 0 cM for completely linked markers. The female- and male-specific maps are illustrated in Figs 1 and 2, respectively. The detailed map information was provided in Supplementary data S1.

The sex-averaged map spanned 3,505.4 cM with an average marker interval of 0.22 cM, ranging from 0.17 cM/marker (LG12) to 0.30 cM/marker (LG18). The genetic map is illustrated in Fig. 3.

Analysis of recombination ratesWithin each linkage group, mild to strong localized specific recombination patterns were observed, whereby recombination rates were usually elevated towards the end and suppressed in the middle of the map (Fig. 4). Clustered markers that fell into ‘zero recombination rate’ were observed in every linkage group, especially in positions close to the centromeres in contrast to the telomeres (Supplementary data S1). The patterns of localized regional recombination rates along each linkage group.The patterns of localized regional recombination rates along each linkage group.There is no significant difference in recombination rate among three mapping families based on the examination with common marker pairs among the three families (see Methods section). In contrast, significant higher recombination rates were observed in a majority of the linkage groups of the female genetic map than that of male genetic map (P < 0.01). Overall, the female genetic map was 1,901.4 cM longer than male genetic map, with an average female-to-male ratio of 1.7 : 1 (Table 3). The ratio varied by linkage groups, ranging from 0.97 : 1 in LG22 to 2.50 : 1 in LG1 (Table 3). The largest differences in recombination rate between the female and male maps were observed in LG1, LG5, LG7, LG18, LG27, and LG29. Across all these linkage groups, the female : male recombination ratios exceeded 2.0. LG22 was unusual in that recombination rates were very similar between the sexes (i.e. 0.97 : 1). Within unique map positions, 504 SNPs were commonly shared between the two sexes, while significantly higher recombination rates were observed in majority of the common locus intervals (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5). Comparison of the recombination rate between female and male. The inter-marker distances (cM) for all pairs of adjacent markers from both female- and male-specific maps were used.

Integration and validation with physical mapThe integration of the genetic map with the BAC-based physical map anchored 2,728 (83%) of the 3,307 physical map contigs (Table 5). Together with the 1,481 (44.8%) physical map contigs that were anchored previously,6 we were able to anchor a total of 2,880 (87.1%) physical map contigs consisting of 28,416 BAC clones (92.9% of total BAC clones). The sizes of anchored physical map contigs varied from 66.0 kb to 2,005.8 kb (Supplementary data S2), with an average size of 301 kb. Together, a total of 867.4 Mb of the physical map was integrated by genetic linkage map that accounted for ~90% of the channel catfish genome (Table 5). Detailed information regarding integration of linkage map and physical map is provided in Supplementary data S2. Integration of channel catfish linkage map with physical mapData obtained from Xu et al.6Data obtained from Ninwichian et al.9Integration of channel catfish linkage map with physical mapData obtained from Xu et al.6Data obtained from Ninwichian et al.9The integration of linkage map and physical map enabled the cross-validation of the quality of the physical map and the genetic map (Table 6). A total of 1,467 physical map contigs containing 2,961 BES-associated SNPs were placed onto linkage maps. With 615 physical map contigs, two or more SNP markers were mapped that allowed the determination of orientation of the physical map contigs along the chromosome. With such contigs, the quality of physical map contigs was assessed based on the mapped markers. An illustration with linkage group 12 is provided in Fig. 6. The vast majority of physical contigs were validated, but a small fraction of physical map contigs was found incorrectly assembled, or the ordering of the SNP markers onto the map was in error.

The linkage group 12 (LG12) was used for the illustration. Vertical bars represent physical map contigs containing at least two SNPs mapped onto the linkage map, and the dot spots indicate physical map contigs with only one SNP.A total of 47 physical map contigs had markers that were mapped in different linkage groups, indicating the potential errors of the physical map assembly or the mapping errors of incorrectly assigned SNPs. These errors could be caused by SNPs falling into duplicated regions of genome. Moreover, of the 2,707 BAC clones with BES-associated SNPs, 238 BAC clones contained at least two BES-associated SNPs. Within this group, 7 BAC clones were mapped onto different LGs, suggesting the misplacement of those SNP markers onto the linkage groups. As an illustration, the integration of sex-averaged linkage map with physical map Contig72 and Contig534 is shown in Fig. 7, presenting the correct and incorrect physical map assembly, respectively. The manual check of the potential assembly or mapping error warrants the correctness of both physical map and linkage map in the next step. Example of validation of physical map using the linkage map.

(A) shows the correct physical map contig using Contig72 as an example; (B) shows the incorrect physical map contig using Contig534 as an example.Physical distances were estimated based on the position of SNP markers within each physical map contig, which allowed for estimation of the ratios of physical distance to genetic distance (Supplementary data S3). On the other hand, recombination frequencies can be calculated for physical map contigs with multiple SNP markers mapped onto the linkage map. With the sex-averaged linkage map, the genetic size of 3,505.4 cM and the physical size of 965,279 kb based on the physical map, we estimated the average genetic size as 3.6 cM per Mb. The ratios observed from the 250 physical map contigs that contained multiple SNPs mapped onto the linkage map ranged from 0 to 2.26 cM per Mb. The markers with higher ratios might indicate the potential loci of recombination hot spots.4. DiscussionIn this work, we constructed a high-density genetic map for channel catfish. This map possesses the highest marker density among all the genetic linkage maps constructed for any aquaculture species. Taking advantage of the catfish 250K SNP array, we were able to efficiently and cost-effectively genotype 250,000 SNPs in the 576 fish from three mapping families (192 fish per family). Such a high-density linkage map should be a valuable resource for analysis and fine-scale QTL mapping in catfish.Although the efficient SNP genotyping technology allowed the construction of high-density linkage map, the high-resolution was yet to be achieved. A large number of markers fell into ‘zero recombination clusters’ where no recombination events occur during meiosis between the markers among the fish used for mapping analysis. These represent closely arrayed adjacent SNP positions, and their ordering is likely best achieved by assessing their order within the aligned physical map contigs. Conversely, it was also observed that genetic recombination rates could be artificially inflated when genotyping errors occur or when markers with large amounts of missing data are included in the analysis.42,43 Similar situations were observed previously in zebrafish during the construction of high-density genetic map. In zebrafish, the genetic sizes of initial map were over 1,000 cM per chromosome. After removal of genotyping errors, the genetic sizes were reduced to around 100 cM.44 To reduce the effect of clustered markers on the map construction and reduce the computing load, we picked one representative anchor marker that had the most informative meiosis from each of these clusters in the linkage map construction. Afterwards, we rejoined the markers within the ‘zero recombination clusters’ that were excluded during the initial mapping steps. This procedure relocated the informative markers onto the linkage maps based on the positions of their representative anchor marker. Such clustered markers are still valuable for the chromosome-scale scaffolding.With the availability of such high-density mapped SNPs, the patterns of marker distribution across chromosomes can be examined. It appears that clustered markers were commonly found in regions around centromeres while less frequently found around the telomeres. This was consistent with observations in various genetic maps previously developed in fish species, such as tilapia,45 medaka,46 rainbow trout,47 Atlantic salmon,12 and catfish.9,16 One potential explanation is that the centromeres contain abundant tandemly repeated, heterochromatic DNA sequences.48 As shown in Fig. 4, the distribution of mapped SNP markers across chromosomes in channel catfish is consistent with the observation of telomere and centromere effects,49 which would result in a higher recombination rate near the telomeres while a lower recombination rate near the centre of the chromosomes. The recombination rates might be positively correlated with GC content, as in human,50 pig,51 chicken,52 rodent,53 and yeast,54 or correlated with some other genomic features such as gene density and the presence of genes determining recombination hotspots. The PRDM9 gene was recently found to determine the recombination hotspots in the mammalian genomes.55–57 Future investigations on recombination landscape warrant the characterization of genomic features, affecting the meiotic recombination in catfish upon the availability of fully assembled genome sequences.The suppression of recombination in males relative to the females observed in channel catfish (averaged female-to-male ratio is 1.7 : 1) was consistent with our previous observation2 as well as many other studies. Recombination rates differ between the two sexes in many organisms where recombination occurs more frequently in the homogametic sex than in the heterogametic sex.50,58 The similar phenomenon was reported in many other fish species such as Atlantic salmon (1.38 : 1), rainbow trout (1.68 : 1), European sea bass (1.60 : 1), Arctic char (1.69 : 1), and silver carp (1.52 : 1).12,14,58–61 Striking recombination differences between the sexes were observed in zebrafish (2.74 : 1)58 and grass carp (2.0 : 1).62 These observations indicated that even closely related fish species differ in genetic sizes and the extent of sexual dimorphism for recombination fraction,50 similarly as in mammals. Although the genetic basis for recombination bias between sexes remains unknown, several theories were proposed to explain this observation. One explanation from selection perspective suggests that selection pressure is stronger in male gametes than in female gametes during the haploid life stage. This difference could lead to male-specific selection to maintain beneficial haplotype to decrease the male recombination rate.58,63 An alternative explanation is that the female recombination rate is higher to compensate for the apparently less stringent checkpoint for achiasmatic chromosomes compared with males.50 In human, cytological studies suggested that sex-specific differences in recombination may derive from chromatin differences established prior to the onset of the recombination pathway.64The high-density and the relatively high-resolution genetic map provides valuable resource for integrating the physical map and whole-genome assemblies. In this study, we anchored the catfish physical map to genetic linkage map through BES and PMCSS that contain SNP markers. With this linkage map of channel catfish, we were able to anchor 87% of the catfish BAC physical map contigs, covering ~92% of the catfish genome. This is a great improvement on map integration compared with our previous efforts that only anchored 44.8% of the catfish BAC physical map contigs accounting for 52.8% of the catfish genome. To our knowledge, this is also the highest percentage of physical maps integration with genetic maps that were obtained in any aquaculture species. The well-integrated map is useful for comprehensive comparative genomic analyses, fine-scale mapping of QTL, and positional cloning for candidate genes.10 Moreover, the integrated map can be used as an important resource for the validation of the catfish whole-genome assembly.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant (No. 2012-67015-19410) from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and partially supported by USDA Aquaculture Research Program Competitive Grant (No. 2014-70007-22395) from USDA NIFA.

IntroductionTrees have unique features that distinguish them from most herbaceous species, including large sizes, long lifespans and woody, perennial growth. Many tree species occur in widely distributed populations that harbour a wealth of diversity.1 Large, diverse tree populations can be exploited for breeding to improve economically important properties. In addition, deciphering the mechanisms by which forest trees have adapted to their changing environments is an intriguing research problem. Tree growth and wood formation are complex dynamic processes that require coordinate regulation of diverse metabolic pathways in the whole plant.2,3 Improving economically important traits in trees by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) will require improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation, particularly for traits with complex genetic architecture, such as wood properties or growth. Research has been hindered by trees' large size, long generation times, and the lack of mutants for reverse genetic approaches.1,4As an alternative approach, recent work has examined complex traits in trees by forward genetic methods, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) and association mapping of genes or alleles underlying quantitative traits.5 Single-marker association studies have identified candidate functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that explain a small proportion of the additive variation (=5% on average) in growth or wood properties, and many of these genes have not been cloned in full length yet.6–10 It is well known that genes do not work in isolation; instead, complex cellular pathways and molecular networks are often involved in phenotypic variation.11 Variation in quantitative traits includes additive, dominant, and epistatic effects that are conferred by multiple variants within interactive genes in different biological pathways.11,12 The complete effects of genetic variation for multiple full-length genes [including promoter, introns, untranslated regions (UTRs), and exons] in related biological pathways remain to be addressed in forest trees. Multi-gene association models take advantage of large numbers of SNPs in population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) with QTL regions harbouring functional loci affecting complex traits.13 Studies using multi-gene association may identify genetic variants that jointly have significant effects but individually make only a small contribution.13,14Our previous studies using single-marker association (i.e. mixed linear models15) have identified sites of SNPs in several candidate genes that located in close proximity to the causal polymorphisms or even the functional variant itself for growth and wood-property traits.16–19 To extend these observations, this study investigates the nature of genetic variance (additive, dominant, and epistatic effects) for 11 full-length candidate genes related to cellulose biosynthesis in 10 quantitative traits, using multi-gene association, as well as haplotype-based association approaches, in a population of 460 unrelated individuals of Populus tomentosa. To verify the most significant associations, we conducted single-marker analysis in a family-based linkage population consisting of 1,200 individuals. Moreover, tissue-specific transcript abundances of these genes provide a better understanding of the multi-gene network, affecting tree growth and lignocellulose biosynthesis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Population materials and phenotypic dataThe discovery population (association population) consisted of 460 24-yr-old unrelated individuals, representing almost the entire natural distribution range of P. tomentosa, i.e. Southern region, Northwestern region, and Northeastern region (30–40°N, 105–125°E). Plants were randomly sampled in 2009 from a collection of 1,047 natural P. tomentosa in Guan Xian County, Shandong Province, China (36°23'N, 115°47'E) and used for the initial multi-gene association (Supplementary Table S1, Du et al.12). In addition, 40 unrelated individuals were randomly selected from this association population and used to identify SNPs.To confirm the association results identified in the discovery population, a validation population (linkage population) consisting of 1,200 hybrid individuals were randomly selected from 5,000 F1 progeny established by controlled crossing between clone ‘YX01’ (Populus alba× Populus glandulosa) as the female and clone ‘LM 50’ (P. tomentosa) as the male. The progeny were planted in 2008 in the Xiao Tangshan horticultural fields, Beijing, China (40°2'N, 115°50'E) using a randomized complete block design with three replications per genotype.Ten growth and wood-property traits were scored for all individuals in the two populations, using at least three replications per genotype. The growth traits were tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and stem volume. The wood-property traits were holocellulose, a-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content (chemical composition), and fibre length, fibre width, and microfibre angle (physical properties) (Supplementary data S1–S2). The detailed sampling and measurement methods, and phenotypic variance for these 10 traits in the two populations were conducted as previously described.17,20 Pearson's correlations for these 10 phenotypic traits were shown in Supplementary data S3.2.2. RNA extraction and cDNAs identificationThirty ramets of 1-yr-old P. tomentosa clone ‘LM50’ were selected and planted at Xiao Tangshan horticultural fields, Beijing, China (40°2'N, 115°50'E). A piece of bark was peeled off from the main stem at ~1.0 m height of 1-yr-old P. tomentosa clone ‘LM50’ using a chisel. The newly formed xylem (~3 mm thick) was first removed from the exposed surface, and then mature xylem was collected by further scraping into the stem at ~2 mm thick; finally, the collected samples were placed into 50-ml Falcon tubes filled with liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at -80°C until RNA extraction.21 Using the Plant Qiagen RNeasy kit, total RNA from the stem xylem tissues was extracted and then reverse transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The stem xylem cDNA library was constructed using the Superscript <U+03BB> System (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA). The detailed procedures for constructing the cDNA library were previously described by Li et al.21 In our study, the cDNA library consisted of 5.0 × 106 pfu with an insert size range of 1.0–4.0 kb. By random end-sequencing of 30,000 cDNA clones and comparison with all sequences in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), we chose 11 cDNAs with high similarities to Arabidopsis or Populus trichocarpa sequences to examine the relationship with lignocellulosic biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S2). All cDNA sequences chosen were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers shown in Supplementary Table S2).2.3. DNA extraction and full-length genomic DNA identificationUsing the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen China, Shanghai), total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh young leaves. For sequencing the full-length genomic DNA sequences, specific primers were designed based on each cDNA sequence. PCR amplification was performed according to Zhang et al.22 All the genomic DNA of candidate genes were obtained by direct sequencing of both strands, using conserved T7 and SP6 primers in the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (version 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and a 4300 DNA Analyzer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Full-length genomic DNA sequences of all 11 candidate genes were isolated by PCR amplification from the P. tomentosa LM50 clone (Supplementary Table S2). Of these, five of these genes were previously reported in single-marker association studies (Supplementary Table S2). Also, these 11 full-length gene sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers shown in Supplementary Table S2).2.4. Tissue-specific expression analysisFresh tissues (root, stem phloem, stem cambium, developing xylem, mature xylem, expanding leaf, expanded leaf, and apex) were sampled from 1-yr-old plants of P. tomentosa (clone LM50). Developing xylem tissues were collected by scraping the thin (~1.0 mm) and partially ligni<U+FB01>ed layer on the exposed xylem surface of main stems at the 1.0 m height of plant, and the liquid stem cambium was collected from the exposed xylem surface as described previously.21 The main root (5 cm in length), expanding leaf (the 2–3rd leaf from the stem top), expanded leaf (the 5–6th leaf), and the final shoot apex (2–3 mm in length) were immediately collected from 1-yr-old P. tomentosa clone ‘LM50’. The extraction of RNA from various fresh tissues and the reverse transcription into cDNA was used for testing of tissues-specific transcript abundance for all 11 candidate genes. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) was performed on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI) using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche). The qPCR program and the real-time amplification reaction were performed as described by Du et al.16 All reactions were performed in triplicate technical and triplicate biological repetitions, respectively. The melting curve was used to check the specificity of the amplified fragments, and all data were analysed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis software 3.1 tool (Bio-Rad, USA), following the manual protocol. The results obtained for the different tissues were standardized to the levels of Actin gene (the internal control). The specific primer pairs were individually designed to target the 3' UTR of each gene, using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) (Supplementary Table S3). Mean value and standard deviation (s.d.) for expression data of all repetitions in each set was determined using SPSS Statistics Version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (Details not shown).To better understand the co-expression interactions among these candidate genes, Pearson's correlations between each pair of genes were determined for all 11 genes, according to their tissue-specific transcript abundances in SPSS Statistics, version 19.0. A structural network representing significant gene–gene correlations was visualized using the NodeXL Excel Template, version 1.0.1.238 (http://nodexl.codeplex.com/).2.5. SNP discovery and genotypingTo identify SNPs, full-length genomic DNA of all 11 candidate genes were sequenced and aligned among 40 unrelated individuals from the association population of P. tomentosa, without considering insertions/deletions (INDELs). All 440 sequences were deposited in GenBank (Supplementary Table S4). Sequence alignments and manual editing were performed as described by Du et al.17 Next, all common SNPs (minor allele frequency =0.05) identified were genotyped using the Beckman Coulter (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) sequencing system.2.6. Nucleotide diversity and LDDiploid sequences were phased into haplotypes with the Phase v. 2.1, using 10,000 iterations of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Model.23 We then used alignments of these 40 phased haplotypes for each gene to estimate the number of segregating sites, nucleotide diversity, neutrality tests, and the pattern of codon usage with DnaSP version 5.10.24 Nucleotide diversity was estimated using the average number of pairwise differences per site (p)25,26 and the number of segregating sites (<U+03B8>w).27 Neutrality test statistics, Tajima's D,28 and Fu and Li's D,29 were calculated using data for the whole population with 10,000 coalescent simulations. The pattern of codon usage was measured using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU).30The squared correlation of allele frequencies (r2)31 between each pair of common SNPs (frequency = 0.05) within candidate genes was calculated with 105 permutations, using TASSEL Ver. 2.0.1 (http://www.maizegenetics.net/). To assess the extent of LD within the sequenced gene regions, the decay of LD with physical distance (base pairs) within each candidate locus and over all candidate genes was estimated in 10,000 permutations of the data by non-linear regression.32 Singletons were excluded in the LD analyses. This analysis was done both within the three climatic regions and for the complete data set.2.7. Association analysisfGWAS, version 2.0 (http://statgen.psu.edu/software/fgwas-soft.html, Li et al.33), in R (http://cran.r-project.org/) was used to conduct multi-SNP association analyses. For each trait, the genotyping data for all common SNPs and their genomic positional information were identified and standardized using PLINK version 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/res.shtml). This software is a Bayesian hierarchical model and use a MCMC algorithm to simultaneously <U+FB01>t and estimate the possible additive and dominant effects associated with all SNPs. The proportion of the phenotypic variance (R2) explained by each particular SNP was estimated in the models. Positive dominance represents that the phenotypic mean value observed within the heterozygous class is higher than the average phenotypic mean across both homozygous classes based on Least Squares Means, whereas negative dominance was opposite (not a recessive lethal). To address the total phenotypic variance accounted for by all trait-associated SNPs on a trait-by-trait basis, we calculated a ‘cumulative R2’ metric. These values were obtained by the difference in R2 between full and reduced models.34 The details were referenced according to McKown et al.35A multifactorial dimensionality reduction (MDR) method36 that was designed specifically for detecting and characterizing non-additive interactions (i.e. epistasis). The ReliefF algorithm was applied to filter all unlinked SNPs (r2 < 0.1 or different genes) to the best five loci for each trait that provide the greatest signal with 100 nearest neighbours. MDR was applied to assess all two-way to five-way models for the five significant filtered SNPs. Finally, an independent assessment of epistasis was performed using entropy-based measures of information gain.37 Specifically, a new measure model of three-way epistasis that adjusts for lower order effects was used to examine high-order non-additive interactions.38All high-LD haplotypes (r2= 0.70, P= 0.001) were estimated for each gene, and their frequencies were determined using HaploView version 4.2 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview.html). Singleton alleles and haplotypes with a frequency <5% were discarded when constructing the haplotypes. Haplotype-based association tests with phenotypic traits were performed using the Haplo.stats package in R,39 and significances of the haplotype associations were identified based on 104 permutation tests. The input consisted of genotype matrices, phenotype matrices, and structure analysis matrices (Q) to correct for population structure.40 In this analysis, the Q matrix was identified according to the optimal subpopulation structure in our association population.41 Corrections for multiple testing of smoothed P-values for all associations were performed using the false discovery rate (FDR) through QVALUE.42 A q-value of 0.10 was considered as the significance threshold.On the basis of significant SNPs identified above, gene sequences were compared between hybrid parents, and SNP markers that segregated in the 1,200 F1 progeny were selected. Inheritance tests of these SNPs were examined in the linkage population by performing a <U+03C7>2 test at 0.01 probability, and SNPs following Mendelian expectations were used in single-marker analysis using PLINK version 1.07. The same FDR method was used to correct for multiple tests.423. Results3.1. Tissue-specific transcript profilingTo provide insights into gene interactions and functions in the biological pathway, we examined transcript accumulation for 11 candidate genes in various tissues and organs of P. tomentosa, including root, stem, and leaf (Fig. 1A). We found that the 11 genes exhibited distinct, but partially overlapping patterns of expression. Most genes were preferentially expressed in the developing xylem and mature xylem, with moderate expression in the cambium region and expanded leaves (Fig. 1A). For example, in the stem of P. tomentosa, Cellulose synthase 7 (PtoCesA7), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase 1 (PtoUGDH1), and S-adenosine-l-homocysteine-hydrolase 1 (PtoSAHH1) transcripts were most abundant in the developing and mature xylems, with moderate abundance in the cambium. PtoCesA7 and PtoUGDH1 were also preferentially expressed in roots (Fig. 1A), whereas PtoCesA3 and UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase 1 (PtoUXS1) were highly expressed in the apex (Fig. 1A). PtoUXS1 were most abundant in expanded leaves. Tissue-specific transcript profiling and a correlation network of 11 candidate genes in Populus tomentosa.

Data were log-transformed before Pearson's correlation.Next, we constructed gene–gene correlation networks using the patterns of tissue-specific expression of these 11 candidate genes and identified 20 positive or negative gene–gene correlations (P = 0.05, Supplementary Table S5) that make up a highly interrelated network (Fig. 1B). Of these gene pairs, PtoCesA3 and Sucrose synthase 1 (PtoSUS1) (P = 0.01, R = -0.938), PtoSAHH1 and PtoSAHH2 (P = 0.01, R = 0.959), and PtoCesA4 and Endo-1,4-ß-glucanase 1 (PtoGH9A1) (P = 0.01, R = 0.952) showed highly significant correlations (Supplementary Table S5).3.2. SNP discovery and nucleotide diversityWe first used a re-sequencing approach to identify SNPs in all 11 candidate genes. By sequencing the 11 full-length genes from 40 unrelated individuals encompassing nearly the entire natural range of P. tomentosa, we identified 2,114 SNPs in the c. 47,300 bp sequenced, with an average density of one SNP per 25 bp. Of these SNPs, c. 44.0% (930) were common sites (frequency = 0.05) (Supplementary Table S4). The SNPs were not evenly distributed, with the number of SNPs per gene ranging from 59 to 388 (average, 192), consistent with varying levels of nucleotide diversity among genes (Supplementary Table S4). Using sequences from the P. trichocarpa reference as an out-group, a survey of the single-base mutation types indicated that C : T changes were the most abundant (38.6%), followed by A : G changes (30.4%), and overall SNPs the ratio of transitions to transversions was 2.23.Within the coding regions of all 11 genes (22,098 bp total sequence), the average non-synonymous nucleotide diversity (dN) was ~5-fold lower than the synonymous nucleotide diversity (dS), and the dN/dS ratio was <1 for all exons, indicating strong purifying selection at non-synonymous sites at these Populus genes.22 To investigate the extent of codon bias in P. tomentosa, we calculated RSCU values for all types of codons and found that the 11 candidate genes show similar patterns of RSCU (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most of the preferred codons end with U, but A and G were also less commonly found in the third position in these genes. Previous studies indicated that codon bias (with C or G ending codons) is expected to be strongest for highly expressed genes.34 Thus, our observation may be consistent with low expressed values for all these genes (Fig. 1A). More work is needed to sort these issues out in P. tomentosa. The values of Fu and Li's D statistical tests were negative for all genes, with four significant departures observed in the whole population (P= 0.05, Supplementary Table S4), revealing an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms in the species-wide samples.3.3. SNP genotyping and LDWe selected a set of 651 common SNPs that met the quality control thresholds and that had genotype frequencies consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (Supplementary data S4). The percentage of successfully genotyped SNPs that were found in non-coding regions of the genes was 75.4%, distributed within introns (45.4%), 5' UTRs (16.9%), and 3' UTRs (13.1%). Remaining SNPs were located in the coding regions, either at synonymous sites (18.5%) or at non-synonymous sites (6.1%).Estimates of r2 values for all pairwise combinations of SNPs were pooled to assess the overall pattern of LD with physical distance (Fig. 2). The non-linear regression shows a clear and rapid decline of LD from 0.60 to 0.10 at a distance of ~1,100 bp in the whole population (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, LD analyses within each geographical climatic region showed a much higher level of LD with the r2 values declining to 0.1 within c. 2,300 bp (Southern and Northeastern regions) and c. 3,400 bp (Northwestern region) (Fig. 2). We found a clear and rapid decline of LD with distance within each gene in the whole population, respectively (r2 = 0.1, within c. 500–1,800 bp, Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that LD does not extend over entire gene in the species. Decay pattern of LD in all Populus tomentosa samples and each climatic region. Decay of LD for all common SNP (minor allele frequency = 5%) sites pooled across all analysed genes. Pairwise correlations between SNPs are plotted against the physical distance between the SNPs in base pairs. The curves describe the non-linear regressions of r2 (Er2) onto the physical distance in base pairs. The details of three climatic regions are shown in Supplementary Table S1.Decay pattern of LD in all Populus tomentosa samples and each climatic region.

The curves describe the non-linear regressions of r2 (Er2) onto the physical distance in base pairs. The details of three climatic regions are shown in Supplementary Table S1.3.4. Multi-SNP association under additive, dominance, and epistasis modelsWe first employed Bayesian hierarchical models, emphasizing multi-SNP additive and dominant effects for each quantitative trait, and uncovered a multitude of genetic associations, including some not previously found by single-marker methods (Supplementary Table S6). Some particular SNP-trait associations detected previously were examined in this case; for example, a non-synonymous substitution in exon3 of PtoCesA4 (PtoCesA4_1914) was shown to be in strong association with a-cellulose.17 We then constructed a structural network to visually represent all 123 associations (P < 0.01) between all 10 growth and wood-property traits and 93 unique SNPs (Fig. 3). The 93 loci were not evenly distributed among all 11 genes, with a range from 1 (PtoBGlu1, ß-1,4-glucosidase) to 19 (PtoUXS1). 37.6% of the 93 loci were distributed in coding regions, and among these, 94.3% of the associations contained a combination of additive and dominant effects (Supplementary Table S6). A structural network that represents all significant associations (P < 0.01) in the association population of Populus tomentosa.

All associations were identified between 10 growth and wood-property traits and 93 unique SNPs from 11 candidate genes using Bayesian hierarchical models. Different colours represent different genes with corresponding SNPs. The number of SNPs identified in each gene is shown in parentheses.We detected 118 significant associations for a total of 92 unique SNPs within 11 genes associated with all 10 traits (Table 1 and Supplementary data S6). Total numbers of identified SNP-trait associations varied across trait categories, and the association numbers of associations for wood chemical compositions, wood physical properties, and growth traits were 40, 38, and 40, respectively. SNP markers explained between 0.5 and 6.6% of the phenotypic variation (average R2 = 2.3%; Supplementary Table S6). Twenty-four of the 92 SNP markers exhibited significant associations with at least two traits (Supplementary Table S6). Although the association result does not indicate which SNPs may be causal, 11 of these 92 unique SNPs represent amino acid replacement (non-synonymous) polymorphisms (Supplementary Table S6). For each trait, the number of significant SNPs ranged from 8 to 16, which captured a small to moderate fraction (17.0–36.0%) of the additive variation when considered jointly (Table 1, Fig. 4). Summary of the additive effect and phenotypic contribution rate (R2) of all significant SNPs for each trait in the Populus tomentosa association populationSee Supplementary Table S6 for further details of these association results under additive models; significance level for association (significance is P = 0.01).Total R2 was calculated according to McKown et al.35Summary of the additive effect and phenotypic contribution rate (R2) of all significant SNPs for each trait in the Populus tomentosa association populationSee Supplementary Table S6 for further details of these association results under additive models; significance level for association (significance is P = 0.01).Total R2 was calculated according to McKown et al.35Low-to-moderate phenotypic contribution rate (R2) explained for growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa.

All SNPs were identified using the Bayesian hierarchical models in fGWAS, version 1.0 (http://statgen.psu.edu/software/fgwas-soft.html) in R (http://cran.r-project.org/).Correspondingly, each trait was associated with variation in at least five candidate genes (Table 1). Furthermore, we identified three genes (PtoCesA4, PtoCesA7, and PtoSAHH2) that were associated to all four wood chemical compositions. (Supplementary Table S6). For wood physical properties, SNP-trait associations were identified for four genes (PtoCesA3, PtoCesA4, PtoSUS1, and PtoUXS1) that were associated with all three traits. In addition, PtoCesA7 and PtoSAHH2 were associated with fibre length and microfibre angle (Supplementary Table S6). Additive models found nine genes with SNPs associated with variation in growth traits; of these, two genes (PtoCesA3 and PtoUXS1) with SNPs associated across all three growth traits, as well as identified with all three wood physical properties (Supplementary Tables S6). At least five SNPs within PtoUXS1 had associations to each growth trait. No significant SNP from PtoUGDH and PtoBGlu1 was associated with growth traits.On the basis of these additive SNPs simultaneously associated to each trait (Supplementary Table S6), we identified phenotypic variation among possible genotype combinations for the same trait and some genotype combinations that may be useful for selection breeding. An example of multi-genotype combinations for lignin is shown in Fig. 5. Eight SNPs from six different genes were significantly associated with lignin content, with two associated SNPs from PtoGH9A1 showing low LD and hence representing independent associations.

(A) These eight allelic variants have significant additive effect with a small proportion of phenotypic variation (R2), ranging from 0.80 to 5.48%.

Of the 92 SNPs, ~95% of the significant SNPs had both additive and dominant effects on all traits within each category (Supplementary Table S6). Many genes were repeatedly associated with multiple traits within/across trait categories, and different SNPs with different effects from the same gene were identified. A number of SNP associations with positive versus negative effect across the three trait categories were 25/16 for wood chemical compositions, 25/12 for wood physical properties, and 22/21 for growth traits (Table 2). When we considered dominant variation per trait by combining the positive and negative types, the total number of significant SNPs varied from 8 to 18, with the total R2 explained ranging from 1.8 to 13.0% (Fig. 4).

Of these, 22 SNPs were located in the coding regions, including 7 non-synonymous and 15 synonymous changes. A number of significant SNPs per gene varied from 1 to 11. For each trait, the number of SNPs ranged from 3 to 10, with total R2 explained ranging from 9.0 to 30.0% (Table 2). For the 49 associations showing negative dominant effects, we identified 44 loci from 10 genes that were significantly associated with 10 traits, with a small R2 explained per locus ranging from 0.6 to 5.4%, respectively. The number of significant SNP within each gene varied from 1 (PtoBGlu1) to 11 (PtoUXS1). A range of 2–8 SNPs with the negative dominant effects was found for each trait, with total variation explained ranging from 4.4% (a-cellulose) to 17.3% (microfibre angle) (Table 2). Ten SNPs from six genes that simultaneously have positive and negative dominant effects for different traits (Supplementary Table S6). For example, the synonymous SNP PtoSAHH2_285 had a negative dominant effect for lignin, while having a positive effect for holocellulose. Table 2 shows detailed descriptions of the genetic parameters for all traits under positive and negative dominant effects.We used the MDR method (http://phg.mc.vanderbilt.edu/Software/MDR) to detect and characterize SNP–SNP epistasis associated with these traits (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). We first applied the ReliefF algorithm to filter all unlinked SNPs (r2 < 0.1 or located in different genes) to identify significant 5 loci per trait. After correcting for multiple testing, we found 42 associations (Q = 0.10) across nine traits. These associations represent 34 unique SNPs from seven genes with main effects varying from 0.1 to 7.5% (Supplementary Table S7). We found that 9 of the 34 unique SNPs observed in the epistasis models also showed significant additive and dominant effects. Using multi-way SNP–SNP interaction models for these filtered SNPs, we identified 58 significant SNP–SNP pairs where the epistatic interactions ranged from -7.0 to 0.9% (Supplementary Table S8). The majority of epistatic effects were found between unlinked loci located in different genes. We also detected epistatic effects among different SNPs within the same gene. For instance, two epistasis pairs consisting of three SNPs within PtoCesA4 were identified for fibre length, all with negative interaction values (Supplementary Table S8).Three-way interaction model provided a combination of three non-synonymous loci (PtoCesA4_1914, PtoGH9A1_1936, and PtoGA20ox_632) from three unique genes, representing a significant epistatic interaction for DBH and stem volume, with three-way epistatic effects of -11.7 and -12.1% (Fig. 6A). Negative epistatic effects suggest redundancy between loci, meaning that these loci provide, in part, the same information for the traits.36 Figure 6B shows the mean values of phenotypic variances among all three genotype combinations. We investigated the nature of epistatic interactions among non-synonymous mutations, contributing to the phenotypic variation, in the three genes, and discovered that most of the variation is captured by combinatorial permutations of allelic variants at three loci (Fig. 6C). We identified the specific combinatorial patterns of amino acid replacements at these three loci, by comparing the expected values of eight combinations with high (H) or low (L) phenotypic values with the observed values of the specific combinatorial patterns (Fig. 6).

In total, we identified 118, 121, and 43 associations consistent with additive, dominant, and epistatic effects, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6–S8). Also, we observed no differences in the magnitudes of additive and dominant effects between three trait categories (Tables 1 and 2). Some genes have extensive complexity in both genetic variation and the resulting phenotype, and numerous SNPs from different genes were associated across these three trait categories, suggesting that tree growth and wood biosynthesis are complex, dynamic processes that require the coordinate regulation of diverse sets of genes.2,3 Notably, our present investigation suggests that CesA members may have additional functional roles in tree growth and development, beyond the direct effects of the cellulose synthase subunits in biosynthesis of the cell wall. CesA members represent an interesting set of candidates for further study in trees.3.5. Validation of association in the linkage populationTo validate the associations identified above, we examined associations in a linkage population. From the 118 unique significant SNPs obtained by multi-SNP and MDR models (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7), we identified 109 common SNP markers that segregated in the 1,200 F1 progeny following Mendelian expectations (P = 0.01, Supplementary data S5). We conducted 1,090 tests for association of these SNP with growth and wood-quality traits (109 SNPs × 10 traits) in the linkage population. After correction for multiple testing errors, we found 61 associations at the threshold of Q = 0.10, representing 38 SNPs from nine genes that show associations with all 10 traits (Supplementary Table S9). These 38 unique SNPs included 5 non-synonymous, 15 synonymous, and 18 non-coding SNPs (Supplementary Table S9). Thirty SNPs were similarly detected by multi-SNP additive and dominance models in the discovery population, and nine loci were shared between the epistasis models and the single-marker analysis (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Most of the significant markers were identified for multiple traits with different genotypic effects; for example, PtoCesA4_1914 is associated with seven traits, and PtoGA20ox_632 with six (Supplementary Table S9). In addition, 28 (46.0%) associations identified in the validation population were similarly detected in the multi-SNP models (Supplementary Tables S6 and S9). For each trait, the number of SNPs ranged from 3 to 9, with marker effects that varied from 2.2 to 13.5% (Supplementary Table S9). Effect sizes for the SNPs analysed using single-marker linkage test were nearly 2-fold higher than effects identified using multi-SNP models (average R2 = 3.8%).Correspondingly, each trait is associated with at least three candidate genes (Supplementary Table S9) using single-marker linkage analysis. With wood chemical composition, we identified two genes (PtoCesA4 and PtoCesA7) that were simultaneously associated with the content of all four polysaccharide traits. In addition, we identified that PtoGH9A1 was significantly associated with hemicellulose and lignin contents, whereas PtoCesA3 was associated with hemicellulose and a-cellulose content (Supplementary Table S9). Among wood physical properties and growth traits, SNP-trait associations identified two genes (PtoCesA4 and PtoGA20Ox) that were associated with all six traits. Furthermore, PtoUXS1 has SNPs associated with both DBH and stem volume traits, as well as two wood physical properties (fibre width and microfibre angle), consistent with the associations under multi-SNP models in our discovery population (Supplementary Tables S6 and S9). No SNPs from PtoUGDH1 and PtoBGlu1 were associated with any of the 10 phenotypic traits.3.6 Haplotype-based association analysisWe identified 138 high-LD blocks (r2 = 0.70, P = 0.001), including 429 common haplotypes (frequency = 5%) from the 11 candidate genes, with block sizes from 2 to 564 bp. The number of common haplotypes per block varied from 2 to 7, with an average of 3.0 (Table 3). The number of LD blocks and common haplotypes per gene varied from 4 to 20 and 15 to 60, respectively (Table 3). Haplotype-based association tests identified a total of 162 common haplotypes from 66 blocks at P = 0.05 (Table 3 and Supplementary data S10). Using multiple test corrections, we found 39 significant blocks from 10 candidate genes, including 90 haplotypes, that associated with nine traits excluding stem volume (139 associations, Q = 0.10); no significant haplotypes were found for PtoSAHH2. The number of blocks and haplotypes for each trait ranged from 2 to 12 and 5 to 33, respectively (Supplementary Table S11).

For example, haplotypes belonging to PtoUXS1 were associated with seven traits. PtoCesA7 had haplotypes that were simultaneously associated with all four chemical composition traits. In addition, PtoUGDH1 with haplotypes were significantly associated with three chemical compositions, excluding a-cellulose content (Supplementary Table S11). PtoUXS1 had haplotypes that were associated with all three wood physical properties. Within the growth trait category, several significant haplotypes were identified within PtoUXS1 and PtoSUS1 that were associated with tree height and DBH. Examination of haplotypes may provide support for the SNP-based association.On the basis of the significant blocks we identified within several genes for each trait (Supplementary Table S11), we identified four exclusive multi-haplotype combinations with numerous genetic variants for three traits—holocellulose, lignin, and tree height (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taking holocellulose content as example, we identified several combinations of multiple haplotypes from two significant blocks in PtoCesA4 and PtoGH9A1, with mean values from 66.725 to 75.321%, consistent with the two genes having significant correlation (P = 0.01, R = 0.952) (Fig. 1B). In addition, eight unique haplotypes from four genes, showing specific (presence/absence) for different climatic regions of the natural population of P. tomentosa, were associated with five traits, respectively (Table 4). For fibre width, two haplotypes (C-A-G and T-A-G) from PtoSUS1 and PtoBGlu1 were exclusively found in the Northwestern region, and were associated with higher fibre width (Supplementary Table S11).

Discussion4.1. Functional interpretations of genetic associationsHere we have used multi-gene association approaches, combining extensive full-length candidate genes from a shared biological pathway and with detailed, replicated phenotypic information from natural populations of P. tomemtosa to uncover numerous loci underlying variation in wood chemical composition, physical properties, and growth traits. We further validated mostly these associations in an independent linkage population. Significant additive, dominant, and epistatic effects were observed for tree growth and lignocellulosic composition. The number of associations we detected is larger, while the average R2 explained individually is lower, than in previous single-marker association for similar traits in the association population.16–19 Supportively, effect sizes for the SNPs analysed in a large size of linkage population (average R2 = 3.8%) were nearly 2-fold higher than effects identified using multi-gene association models, suggesting that pathway-based association analyses across multiple genes may provide higher power to uncover the relatively small individual effects.14,43 Also, it is possible that linkage drag in regions around the candidate genes causes larger R2 values of allelic variants in the linkage population than in the association population. More statistics models for estimating the genetic effect in multiple population backgrounds are needed. Markers found to be associated with traits span both coding and non-coding portions of genes, with a predominance for additive effects and small effect sizes (Tables 1 and 2), suggesting that this best describe the genetic architecture of complex traits in trees.5,44 Low to moderate R2 were captured by fitting all SNPs simultaneously from all 11 candidate genes (Fig. 4), suggesting that we thus far lack sufficient genomic coverage to capture the majority genetic variation. Many genes with significant SNPs for three trait categories were detected, consistent with our expectations of modelling all combined markers from a set of interrelated genes concurrently, instead of using candidate gene-based ‘one-marker-at-a-time’ approach in tree species.45All candidate genes were originally isolated from a xylem cDNA library of P. tomentosa, and a part of the genes was highly up-regulated in xylem tissue (Fig. 1A), indicating that these genes are likely main candidates for participating in secondary cell wall formation. Previous studies have indicated that wood biosynthesis and tree growth require the coordinate regulation of diverse metabolic pathways, and that the genes in these shared pathways are often functional homologs.3,8 This viewpoint agrees with our observation that the number of common genes (i.e. genes that were identified as being significantly associated with a trait at least twice using different association models, including additive effect, dominance, epistasis, and haplotype) affecting each trait varied from 2 to 6 (Table 5). We identified PtoCesA4 and PtoCesA7 as being associated to four wood chemical compositions (Table 5 and Supplementary data S6), consistent with the central role played by CesA7 and CesA4, as subunits of the CesA complex required for proper secondary wall cellulose synthesis as well as other possible functions related to wall function.46,47 The result supports previous association studies by Wegrzyn et al.7 and Du et al.16,17 In addition, we identified two common genes directly related to polysaccharides (PtoCesA4 and PtoUXS1) that were associated simultaneously with all three wood ultrastructure traits (Table 5). UXS is likely ubiquitous among plants and is a target for regulatory control during cell wall biosynthesis,17 which further supports our findings that PtoUXS1 explains a significant amount of R2 of all growth traits (Table 5). However, the mechanism by which specific allelic variation in PtoUXS1 could affect tree cell elongation is not yet apparent. Identification of the common genes significantly related to growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa+: genes that were identified as being significantly associated with a trait at least two times using different models, including additive effect, dominance, epistasis, and haplotype.Identification of the common genes significantly related to growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa+: genes that were identified as being significantly associated with a trait at least two times using different models, including additive effect, dominance, epistasis, and haplotype.Taking a-cellulose content as an example, we identified six common genes significantly related to this trait, specifically PtoBGlu1, PtoCesA3, PtoCesA4, PtoCesA7, PtoGH9A1, and PtoSUS1 (Table 5). When taken together, multi-SNP models explained a small to moderate portions of the variation from both additive and dominant effects (31.7 and 12.2%, respectively). Previous evidence suggest that these six genes may play key roles in cellulose biosynthesis,47–49 supporting these observations. SNPs in PtoSUS1 showed high additive and dominant effects (Supplementary Table S6), and two LD blocks, including five significant haplotypes (Supplementary Table S11), were associated with a-cellulose. In plants, SUS catalyzes a reversible reaction that preferentially converts sucrose into fructose and UDP-glucose. UDP-glucose is the immediate precursor for the synthesis of cellulose.50 Another enzyme involved in cellulose formation during xylem development is ß-glucosidase (BGlu), which hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose, and is a rate-limiting factor during enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.51 Here, we identified two haplotypes and a non-coding SNP in PtoBGlu1 (Supplementary Tables S6 and S11). Furthermore, korrigan cellulase (KOR), an endo-ß-1,4-glucanase, belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9), can hydrolyze the ß-1,4 linkage of the cellulose chain.52PtoGH9A1, an orthologue of KORRIGAN1, contains three haplotypes associated with a-cellulose (Supplementary Table S6), and we also found epistatic interactions for the trait between a non-synonymous SNP (PtoGH9A1_1936) and SNPs in PtoCesA3 and PtoCesA4. These findings were supported by significant correlations in gene expression among these six genes (Fig. 1B).A similar situation was also observed for hemicellulose, the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose, where we identified several haplotypes and eight SNPs from five of the candidate genes (Supplementary Tables S6 and S11). Of these, PtoUGDP1 and PtoUXS1 are key enzymes in hemicellulose biosynthesis.53,54 Five common candidate genes were shared between wood-property and growth traits (Table 5). PtoSAHH2 is associated with hemicellulose, tree height, and stem volume. The observation is consistent with SAHH being a cytokinin-binding protein participating in xylogenesis.46 Interestingly, associations with lignin were found within genes directly or indirectly related to cellulose or xylan biosynthesis, such as PtoUXS1, PtoCesA4, and PtoCesA7 (Table 5). This finding was supported by the strong genetic interrelations between the lignin biosynthetic pathway and polysaccharide biosynthesis.3,55 Applying biological pathway-based association11 to examine many more candidate genes involved in the diverse metabolic pathways of tree is needed in future investigation.The numerous genes that we detected have multiple significant associations across all three trait categories (Tables 1–3, and 5), and the finding was possible to be explained by two hypothesis. On one hand, significant genetic correlations were frequently estimated among multiple related trait fractions or percentages of the whole tree body, especially within each trait category in our present study (Supplementary data S3). On the other hand, this observation may be considered to be an indication of pleiotropy in the broad sense, and the potential pleiotropic loci identified in this study provide novel candidates for explaining phenotypic variation in Populus. Pleiotropic loci span multiple functions and may have effects by acting upstream in signalling pathways that affect many traits or by directly targeting multiple genes for regulation,35 which is consistent with our discoveries that PtoGA20Ox, PtoSAHH1, and PtoSAHH2 are all associated with multiple traits (Tables 1–5). More work should be focused on transcription factors/regulators in future.4.2. Epistasis for growth and wood-property traitsNon-additive interactions between separate mutations (epistasis) can significantly influence the rate and direction of evolutionary change.13 Also, epistasis is an important but often-ignored component of genetic variation in breeding for quantitative traits, due to limited statistical power to detect and estimate epistasis. In our study, we detected and characterized SNP–SNP epistasis associated with the phenotypic traits by using a MDR method (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). The detection of epistasis hence provides necessary information complementary to that gained through single-locus analysis. We observed that 11 of the 34 unique SNPs identified through the MDR analyses were located in coding regions, with the remaining 23 being located in non-coding regions (Supplementary Table S7), supporting the notion that most associations exhibited pervasive epistatic effects and that it involves both non-coding and coding polymorphisms.56We identified three non-synonymous loci from three unique genes with significant epistatic effects for DBH and stem volume (Fig. 6 A–D). The similar epistatic pattern for these two traits may be due to a significant positive phenotypic correlation (Supplementary data S3).20 Also, the observation may be supported by previous studies reporting that examinations of interactions between amino acid mutations in the same/shared proteins underlying variation in a measurable phenotype may best reveal the mechanisms of epistasis.57 Without the expectations of an additive null model, the phenotypic effects of allelic substitutions (L <U+2192> H and H <U+2192> L) at specific combinatorial patterns of amino acid replacements at these three non-synonymous mutations were highly dependent on genetic background.58 We observed two specific combinatorial patterns: first, in the presence of each amino acid type (H for Ser and L for Thr) in PtoGH9A1_1936, the Asn (L) in PtoGA20Ox_632 conferred an increased phenotype value on the Asn (L) background in PtoCesA4_1914, and a decrease on the His (H) background in PtoCesA4_1914 (Fig. 6B and C). Similarly, the L-type amino acid type in PtoCesA4_1914 conferred a decrease on the Ser (H) background in PtoGA20Ox_632 and an increase on the Asn (L) background in PtoGA20Ox_632 (Fig. 6B and C). Second, without consideration of amino acid types present in PtoCesA4_1914, the L-type in PtoGH9A1_1936 conferred an increased phenotype value in the L background in PtoGA20Ox_632 and a decrease on the H background in PtoGA20Ox_632 (Fig. 6B and C). Similarly, the L-type amino acid in PtoGA20Ox_632 conferred a decrease on the H background in PtoGH9A1_1936 and an increase on the L background in PtoGH9A1_1936 (Fig. 6B and C). These findings are examples of sign epistasis58 and suggest the co-selection of epistatic alleles or protein–protein interactions, although the mechanisms for their generation and maintenance are not clear. These observations were supported by the significant positive correlations in gene expression for each pair of these three genes in our tissue-specific transcript profiling (Fig. 1B).4.3. Future perspectives for MAS breedingThe future of tree improvement will depend on the co-selection of favourable alleles for traits of interest and on the application of combination of haplotypes/genotypes in a manner that effectively overcomes the low levels of LD observed in forest trees.59 Also, genomic selection (GS) is expected to cause a paradigm shift in tree breeding by improving the efficiency and speed of the breeding process.45 Therefore, examining the phenotypic differences among combinations of multiple haplotypes/genotypes for a specific trait (Fig. 5 and Supplementary data S3) provides a foundation for dissecting complex traits through multi-gene or GS in trees. Only 63% of SNPs in haplotypes were identified in the multi-SNP models (Supplementary Tables S6 and S11), consistent with previous observations that haplotype-based tests can detect previously unknown QTL and are thus well supported for unraveling the genetic basis of complex traits.59Populus tomentosa is distributed across a wide geographical area of northern China20 and thus can provide a potential source of region-specific haplotypes (Table 4). These region-specific signatures may reflect, as well as affect, strong regional differentiation in these traits. Probably these fixed loci are likely key to understanding geographic adaptation and may also be targeted in region-based breeding.The present work has identified a number of candidate allelic variants that could be exploited to alter key economic traits for industrial applications. However, the direct use of QTL or association information for MAS breeding has not been successful, chiefly because of the difficulty in transferring associations across populations and species of forest trees.45 Future work should focus on replicated sampling for a larger number of broadly representative ecotypes especially across different environments, as well as considering genetic background or genotype × environment interactions.1 Also, joint mapping with association populations and multiple specific biparental crosses is likely to be extremely powerful for improving map resolution and to improve identification of new alleles. The incorporation of more genes (such as gene family members, transcription factors/regulators, transferases, transporters, kinases, and hydrolases) in shared biosynthetic pathways11 would provide a more complete dissection of the effects of genetic variation on growth and lignocellulosic traits. We believe these studies will gradually drive the application of MAS to selection breeding of trees at the early seedling stage.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the State Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2012CB114506), the National ‘863’ Plan Project (No. 2013AA102702), and the 111 Project (No. B13007).

IntroductionMetagenomic research studies genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled an explosion in sequencing with increased throughput and decreased cost,1 which provides opportunities to generate sequence reads from metagenomes effectively covering highly diverse microbial populations, even for genomes with low coverage. An important step in metagenomic analysis is the assembly of multiple genomes from mixed sequence reads of the multiple species that exist in the sample.2 This can present problems, because, in a microbial community, the number of genomes and the coverage of each genome are initially unknown and the coverage distribution is inhomogeneous and potentially skewed.1–8 Another major difficulty is the short length of sequence reads from next-generation sequencers.2Currently, there are several de novo assemblers that attempt to analyse metagenomic data. MAP,4 Genovo5 and Xgenovo8 are used for rather long sequence reads, while MetaVelvet,2 Meta-IDBA,7 IDBA-UD,9 Ray Meta10 and Omega11 are used for short sequence reads. MAP was designed for the sequence reads produced by Sanger (700–1,000 bp) and 454 sequencing technology (200–500 bp). It uses an improved Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) strategy integrating mate pair information.4 Genovo was designed for 454 sequencing data: it is a metagenomic assembler employing a generative probabilistic model.5 Xgenovo is an extension of Genovo incorporating paired-end information.8 MetaVelvet, Meta-IDBA and IDBA-UD use the de Bruijn graph approach. These assemblers are specifically designed for the huge numbers of short reads generated by Illumina-type next-generation sequencers that enable deep sequencing of the inhomogeneous and divergent species in a microbial community. IDBA-UD is an extension of Meta-IDBA dealing with the uneven sequencing depths of different regions of genomes from different species.9 Both MetaVelvet2 and IDBA-UD9 have been shown to produce longer high-quality assemblies than single-genome assemblers, such as Velvet12,13 and SOAPdenovo2.14 Ray Meta is an extension of the Ray assembler for de novo metagenome assembly, which is scalable because it is highly distributed computing.10 Omega is a metagenomic assembler using overlap graph approach. Omega was most recently proposed for rather longer Illumina sequencing data of microbial communities.11MetaVelvet2 is an extension of a single-genome assembly program (assembler), named Velvet.12,13 The fundamental concept used in MetaVelvet is that a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed sequence reads of multiple species is considered to be equivalent to the union of multiple de Bruijn sub-graphs, each of which is constructed from the sequence reads of individual species. The strategy of MetaVelvet is, first, to decompose a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs and, second, to assemble scaffolds from each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph to build an isolated genome.For the graph disconnection task, MetaVelvet identifies nodes shared between two sub-graphs (named chimeric nodes) and disconnects two sub-graphs by splitting the shared nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Chimeric nodes are shared between the genomes of two closely related species and could represent orthologous sequences, conserved sequences (e.g. rRNA sequences) or horizontal transfer sequences. Chimeric nodes need to be split to obtain independent sub-graphs in a metagenomic assembly.Chimeric nodes need to be split to obtain independent sub-graphs in a metagenomic assembly.To identify chimeric nodes, MetaVelvet uses simple heuristics based on coverage difference and paired-end information, which results in low accuracy and low sensitivity. Our primary goal in this study is to improve chimeric node detection and generate longer accurate scaffolds. Such scaffolds can help to extract more information from the reads, leading to the discovery of more genes and better functional annotation.15 To do this, we have developed an assembler called MetaVelvet-SL, which classifies every node in a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads of multiple species into the following four types by employing supervised machine learning.
The first new procedure in MetaVelvet-SL is to develop the model to classify a node at a crossing point between two paths as chimeric or not. In the process of learning the model, 94 features are extracted for each chimeric node candidate, which is a node at a crossing point that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for learning the classification model. If chimeric nodes can be identified correctly, it means that the de Bruijn graph can be disconnected appropriately by splitting the chimeric nodes. The second new procedure in MetaVelvet-SL is that the expected coverage to extract the unique nodes is calculated for each sub-graph. Based on the assumption that each sub-graph represents a single species, the expected coverage per sub-graph can precisely determine the unique nodes of each species, even those with low coverage. This expected coverage calculation per sub-graph replaces the original MetaVelvet strategy of detecting multiple peaks on the histograms of k-mer frequencies and defining each peak as expected coverage.Chimeric node: A node which is shared between the genomes of two closely related species. This node should be split. Chimeric nodes are illustrated in Fig. 1.Repeat node: A repeat node represents a sequence that occurs several times in the genome. Note that, in multiple genome assembly, nodes at a crossing point between two incoming and two outgoing edges are not necessarily repeats. Such nodes are sometimes chimeric nodes.Unique node: A unique node is one which is neither chimeric nor a repeat. The challenge is to determine the unique nodes of each species correctly.Low-coverage node: In metagenomic assembly, all nodes, even those with low coverage, must be examined to account for species with small populations, but low-coverage nodes must be distinguished from nodes generated by sequencing errors.MetaVelvet-SL consists of two main modules: first, the supervised learning module to develop a model for the classification of chimeric nodes and, second, the assembly module. (The technical details are described in the Materials and methods section.) MetaVelvet-SL also provides a couple of tools to allow users to generate their classification model using prior knowledge about the taxonomic profile of the target microbial community. The taxonomic profile can be inferred from sequence reads by using taxonomic profiling methods, such as MetaPhlAn.16 We have developed a pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL. The pipeline automatically generates a classification model only from metagenomic sequence read data. This customized classification model could be well suited to the assembly of the target metagenomes. MetaVelvet-SL also provides a library of pre-trained classification models for several typical environments, such as soil, deep sea, mud, human blood, intestine and mouth.The source code of MetaVelvet-SL, the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL, and the library of classification models for several typical environments are freely available under the GNU General Public License at http://metavelvet.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp.We conducted computational experiments to evaluate the performance of Metavelvet-SL. The assembly performance of Metavelvet-SL was compared with those of MetaVelvet, the state-of-the-art metagenomic assemblers IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega, and a standard single-genome assembler for massive short sequencing reads, SOAPdenovo2. For simulated data sets, first, we conducted experiments using the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL. The taxonomic profile for the training data set was inferred by MetaPhlAn. Second, to measure the performance of MetaVelvet-SL for different degrees of similarity between the training data set and the assembly data set, we conducted experiments using three levels of training data sets from the highest to the lowest similarity (genus, family and order) to the assembly data sets. For all assembly data sets, MetaVelvet-SL with any training data set generated the highest accurate N50 scores and longest maximum length of accurate scaffolds among the assemblers. (The N50 score is a standard statistical measure that evaluates assembly quality. Scaffolds with higher N50 scores are especially beneficial for the identification of protein-coding genes.2) On real data sets of human gut microbial short read data, sequenced as part of the MetaHIT project17 and the Human Microbiome Project Consortium,18 MetaVelvet-SL using models constructed by supervised learning from the taxonomy profile inferred by MetaPhlAn generated longer scaffolds.2. Materials and methodsA de Bruijn graph is a data structure that compactly represents overlaps between short reads. Several de novo methods based on de Bruijn graphs have been proposed to assemble short reads generated from next-generation sequencers for single genomes and metagenomes.2,7,9,12,13 In a de Bruijn graph, a k-mer (word of length k) is assigned to a node, so the size of a de Bruijn graph is independent of the size of the input of reads. The assembly (reconstruction) of the target genome from the de Bruijn graph can be reduced to finding an Eulerian path that is computable in polynomial time.First, we briefly review the Velvet and MetaVelvet assemblers upon which our method is based. Then we describe MetaVelvet-SL, our extension of Velvet to metagenomic assembly, that utilizes supervised learning.2.1. Brief outline of Velvet and MetaVelvetVelvet is slightly different from other de Bruijn-graph-based assemblers in that each node is attached to a twin node that represents a series of k-mers and their reverse complements for reads from both strands. For each input read, Velvet defines an ordered set of overlapping k-mers. The ordered set is cut whenever an overlap with another read begins or ends. For each uninterrupted ordered subset of the original k-mers, a node is created. Velvet has three functions to manipulate the de Bruijn graph: node merging for simplification, removing tips and removing bubbles for error reduction. Velvet has two functions, Pebble and Rock Band, for constructing the scaffold and for repeat resolution using paired-end and long-read information. In these functions, Velvet distinguishes the unique nodes from the repeat nodes based on the node coverage. A repeat node represents a sequence that occurs several times in the genome and can be described as a node at a crossing point between two paths with multiple incoming and outgoing edges. In multiple genome assembly, such nodes are not necessarily repeats since they can sometimes be shared between the genomes of two closely related species and represent orthologous sequences, conserved sequences (such as rRNA sequences) or horizontal transfer sequences.MetaVelvet is an extension of Velvet for the assembly of metagenomes. The fundamental concept used in MetaVelvet is that a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed sequence reads of multiple species is considered to be equivalent to the union of multiple de Bruijn sub-graphs, each of which is constructed from sequence reads of individual species. MetaVelvet has two functions. First, MetaVelvet decomposes a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs. To do this, MetaVelvet calculates the histogram of k-mer frequencies and detects multiple peaks on the histogram, each peak of which would correspond to one species in a microbial community. Then, MetaVelvet classifies every node into one of the peaks to form sub-graphs composed of nodes belonging to the same peak. MetaVelvet identifies shared (chimeric) nodes between two sub-graphs and disconnects the sub-graphs by splitting the shared nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. To distinguish chimeric nodes from repeat nodes, MetaVelvet uses coverage difference and paired-end information. The second function of MetaVelvet builds scaffolds using Velvet's Pebble and Rock Band functions by treating each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph as an isolated species genome.2.2. Extension to MetaVelvet-SLMetaVelvet-SL consists of three major procedures, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Construction of a de Bruijn graph.MetaVelvet-SL constructs a de Bruijn graph from mixed sequence reads of multiple species genomes using Velvet functions.Learning and classification of chimeric nodes.This procedure, first, extracts the chimeric node candidates from the main de Bruijn graph. A chimeric node candidate is defined as a node that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. MetaVelvet-SL utilizes LIBSVM19 to develop a model for classification of chimeric nodes. We used the RBF kernel that is recommended by LIBSVM. Grid search was used to find optimal parameters for the RBF kernel. For the classification, 94 features are extracted for each chimeric node candidate. These features are (Fig. 3): The dinucleotide frequencies in the chimeric node candidate, the two incoming nodes and the two outgoing nodes. Each node has 16 dinucleotide frequencies (AA, AT, AC, AG, TA, … , GG). (16 features × 5 = 80 features).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with higher coverage and the outgoing node with higher coverage (1 feature).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with higher coverage and the outgoing node with lower coverage (1 feature).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with lower coverage and the outgoing node with higher coverage (1 feature).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with lower coverage and the outgoing node with lower coverage (1 feature).The ratio between the coverage of each incoming node and the coverage of the chimeric node candidate (2 features).The ratio between the coverage of each outgoing node and the coverage of the chimeric node candidate (2 features).The coverage of the chimeric node candidate (1 feature).The lengths of contigs attached to the chimeric node candidate, the two incoming nodes and the two outgoing nodes (5 features).There are three defined classes. Classes 1 and 2 are the positive classes, which contain chimeric nodes, while Class 3 is the negative class, containing non-chimeric nodes. Class 1 contains chimeric nodes in which the incoming node of higher coverage and the outgoing node of higher coverage come from a same species, and the incoming node of lower coverage and the outgoing node of lower coverage come from another species. Class 2 contains chimeric nodes in which the incoming node of higher coverage and the outgoing node of lower coverage come from a same species, and the incoming node of lower coverage and the outgoing node of higher coverage come from another species. Classes 1 and 2 are illustrated in Fig. 3.One additional task in MetaVelvet-SL is the preparation of the training sample that is required for learning the classification model. MetaVelvet-SL uses prior knowledge about the taxonomic profile (composition) of the target microbial community to generate the training sample. This taxonomic profile can be inferred from sequence reads by using taxonomic profiling methods, such as MetaPhlAn.16 MetaVelvet-SL has the following functions to generate the training sample. First, by using the taxonomic profile, a set of reference genomes that belong to species that are the same as or are closely related to those in the taxonomy profile are collected from the public genome database. Second, the collected reference genome sequences are used to generate simulated sequence reads, and a de Bruijn graph is constructed from the simulated read data. Third, by aligning each node in the de Bruijn graph to the reference genome sequences, it can be determined to which species genome each node belongs. Fourth, each node at a crossing point between two paths in the de Bruijn graph is labelled as Class 1, 2 or 3, generating the training samples.Final assembly tasks:Metavelvet-SL has five major steps for this procedure. Load the main de Bruijn graph which has been constructed.Extract the chimeric node candidates and classify them based on the model that has been learned. After obtaining the classifications of chimeric node candidates, split the chimeric nodes that are classified as being Class 1 or 2.Decompose the de Bruijn graph into connected sub-graphs.Identify unique nodes. The expected coverage of each sub-graph is calculated to determine the unique nodes based on the formula used to identify a unique node in Velvet.12 This formula is given in the Supplementary data.Perform the scaffolding procedure (Pebble and Rock Band procedures). The scaffolding procedure is iterated for each set of unique nodes from the lowest expected coverage to the highest expected coverage.MetaVelvet-SL system consists of three major procedures: (i) construction of a de Bruijn graph; (ii) classification of chimeric nodes and (iii) final assembly tasks.MetaVelvet-SL system consists of three major procedures: (i) construction of a de Bruijn graph; (ii) classification of chimeric nodes and (iii) final assembly tasks.Chimeric nodes fall into two classes. Nodes of the same colour represent the same species. The number in each node represents the coverage value of the node. A contig sequence is also attached to each node.Chimeric nodes fall into two classes. Nodes of the same colour represent the same species. The number in each node represents the coverage value of the node. A contig sequence is also attached to each node.In the implementation, MetaVelvet-SL consists of two main modules: (i) the supervised learning module to develop a model for the classification of chimeric nodes and (ii) the assembly module. We provide both modules for MetaVelvet-SL's users. Users can infer the taxonomic profile from sequence reads using several well-known accurate taxonomic profiling methods, such as MetaPhlAn.16 Alternatively, users can generate a classification model by using prior knowledge about the taxonomy profile of the target microbial community. In either case, the resulting customized model could be well suited to the assembly of the target metagenomes. MetaVelvet-SL also provides a library of pre-trained classification models for several typical environments, such as soil, deep sea, mud, human blood, intestine and mouth.Like other assemblers, the input for the assembly module is a set of reads from metagenomes. A pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL has been developed which allows users to automatically generate a classification model and then assemble their metagenomic short read data. The source code of MetaVelvet-SL, the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL, and the library of learning models for several typical environments are freely available at http://metavelvet.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp.3. Results and discussionThe results of MetaVelvet-SL were compared with those from the original MetaVelvet (version 1.2.02),2 the last version of other state-of-the-art metagenomic assemblers such as IDBA-UD,9 Ray Meta (version 2.3.1)10 and Omega (version 1.0.2),11 and the single-genome assembler for massive short sequencing reads SOAPdenovo2.14 We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance on simulated data sets and on real metagenomic data sets of human gut microbial short read data.3.1. Simulated data setWe generated simulated metagenomic sequence reads using the most frequently used simulator—the DWGSIM component in the DNAA package (available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dnaa). We generated short reads with a length of 80 bp and used the default Illumina sequencing noise, whose error rate is 1%. The average and standard deviation of the insert size for paired-end reads were set at 500 and 50 bp, respectively.To measure the performance for various taxonomic levels of diversity, we generated four types of assembly data sets from distant to closer taxonomic levels (order, family, genus and species). We selected 20 genomes for each data set and generated short read data sets from the 20 genomes. Since the log-normal distribution has been generally used to model microbial abundance distributions,20 we used the log-normal distribution for species abundance. MetaVelvet-SL requires a training data set for learning the classification model. First, we conducted experiments using the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL. The taxonomic profile for the training data set was inferred by MetaPhlAn. Second, to measure the performance of MetaVelvet-SL for different degrees of similarity between the training data set and the assembly data set, we conducted experiments using three levels of training data sets that contain different reference genomes from the assembly data sets. The three levels of training data sets consist of similarities to the assembly data set, from the highest to the lowest (genus, family and order). The genus-level training data set contains different species but in the same genus from the assembly data set. The family-level training data set contains different genus but in the same family from the assembly data set. The order-level training data set contains different families but in the same order from the assembly data set. The list of selected genomes, the coverage of each genome, the number of reads generated and the length of each reference genome for each training data set and each assembly data set are provided in Supplementary Tables S1–S20.We compared the performance of MetaVelvet-SL with those of MetaVelvet,2 other state-of-the-art superior metagenomic assemblers, IDBA-UD9 with the default parameters for metagenomic assembly, Ray Meta10 with the k-mer size suggested in the Ray Meta paper and Omega11 with the overlap length suggested in the Omega's instruction, and a single-genome assembler, SOAPdenovo214 with the same k-mer size as MetaVelvet and MetaVelvet-SL.We evaluated the assembly performance with Nm50 and three other measurements: the total length, the maximum length and the number of accurate scaffolds (sub-scaffolds not containing any chimeric region). We defined Nm50, the corrected N50 length for metagenomic assembly results. We cut every scaffold at chimeric mis-assembled points into sub-scaffolds so that the sub-scaffolds no longer contain any chimeric region. The usual N50 is defined to indicate the scaffold length such that 50% of the total length of scaffolds lies in scaffolds of this size or larger. Nm50 is N50 length of the sub-scaffolds not containing any chimeric region. Chimeric regions in a scaffold were determined by two steps. First, the best-fit alignments between a scaffold and the set of input reference genomes are calculated using BLAST so that the predicted reference genome for the scaffold can be obtained. Second, if any region in the scaffold is aligned to another reference genome different from the predicted reference genome for the scaffold, the region is determined as a chimeric region. (The technical details are described in the Supplementary data.)The statistics of assembly results are shown in Table 1. The taxonomic profile for the training data set used in MetaVelvet-SL was inferred by MetaPhlAn. For all assembly data sets, MetaVelvet-SL generated higher Nm50 and longer maximum length of scaffolds than MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta, Omega and SOAPdenovo2. The total length of scaffolds is similar among the assemblers. The results showed that MetaVelvet-SL generated longer accurate scaffolds. Statistics of assembly results for simulated data setsAll computations were executed using Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5540 processors (2.53 GHz), with 96-GB physical memory, except for a few cases. Top performances are shown in bold.Statistics of assembly results for simulated data setsAll computations were executed using Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5540 processors (2.53 GHz), with 96-GB physical memory, except for a few cases. Top performances are shown in bold.For all assembly data sets, Ray Meta required the largest computation times, followed by IDBA-UD. The computation times of MetaVelvet-SL increased at low taxonomic levels compared with MetaVelvet. This is mainly because MetaVelvet-SL requires the computation time for learning the classification model and classifying chimeric node candidates the number of which is larger in low taxonomic levels. The genomes become more similar and share more k-mers in low taxonomic levels. Table 2 represents the number of chimeric node candidates in de Bruijn graph constructed from each assembly data set. The species data set has the highest number of chimeric node candidates which is >10 times of the number of chimeric node candidates in the order data set. The number of chimeric node candidates in de Bruijn graph constructed from each assembly data setThe number of chimeric node candidates in de Bruijn graph constructed from each assembly data setThe statistics of assembly of MetaVelvet-SL using different training datasets are shown in Table 3. The models used in MetaVelvet-SL were generated from the taxonomic profiles predicted by MetaPhlAn and three similarity levels of training data sets (genus, family and order) for each assembly data set. There was no significant difference among the assembly results using different training data sets. This result showed that MetaVelvet-SL was robust for the dissimilarity between the training data set and the assembly data set. Statistics of assembly results of MetaVelvet-SL using different training data setsStatistics of assembly results of MetaVelvet-SL using different training data setsSince one of our primary goals in this work is to improve the sensitivity and accuracy for detecting chimeric nodes by supervised learning, we compared the classification capability of chimeric nodes by MetaVelvet-SL and MetaVelvet. The results of the classification are shown in Table 4. We evaluated the sensitivity and the accuracy. Sensitivity is the true positive rate, the percentage of true identified chimeric nodes (positive classes consists of Class 1 and Class 2), while accuracy is the percentage of true results, both true positive (true identified chimeric nodes) and true negative (true identified non-chimeric nodes, consisting of Class 3). As shown in Table 2, all of the assembly data sets have imbalanced classes of chimeric node candidates. Therefore, to avoid inflated performance estimates on imbalanced data sets, we calculated the balanced accuracy too. Balanced accuracy is the average between sensitivity and specificity.21 Specificity is the true negative rate, the percentage of true identified non-chimeric nodes. As shown in Table 4, the balanced accuracy of MetaVelvet-SL, even for the lowest similarity level of training data set (order-level training data set), was higher than MetaVelvet. Classification results for chimeric nodesSen (%) means the percentage of sensitivity; Acc (%) means the percentage of accuracy and BA (%) means the percentage of balanced accuracy.Classification results for chimeric nodesSen (%) means the percentage of sensitivity; Acc (%) means the percentage of accuracy and BA (%) means the percentage of balanced accuracy.3.2. Real data setTo evaluate the performance of MetaVelvet-SL on real metagenomic data, we used human gut microbial data sets. We assembled five human gut microbial data sets: MH0006 (ERS006497), MH0012 (ERS006494) and MH0047 (ERS006592) from the MetaHIT Consortium17 and SRS017227 and SRS018661 from the Human Microbiome Project Consortium.18 Two of the data sets (MH0006 and MH0012) were the deepest and second deepest data sets while another data set, MH0047, is a low-coverage data set.As for the simulated data sets, the real data sets were assembled by MetaVelvet-SL, MetaVelvet,2 IDBA-UD9 with the default parameters for metagenomic assembly, Ray Meta10 with the k-mer size suggested in the Ray Meta paper, Omega11 with the overlap length suggested in the Omega's instruction and SOAPdenovo2.14 The statistics of assembly performances are summarized in Table 5. The classification model for MetaVelvet-SL was obtained by the pipeline using MetaPhlAn to infer the taxonomic profile and then generating the training data set. Assembly results for the real human gut microbial data setsTop performances are shown in bold. MetaVelvet-SL, MetaVelvet and SOAPdenovo2 set the k-mer size at 37 for the MH0006 and MH0047 data sets, 43 for the MH0012 data set and 51 for SRS017227 and SRS018661.Assembly results for the real human gut microbial data setsTop performances are shown in bold.

MetaVelvet-SL outperformed MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta, Omega and SOAPdenovo2 for all data sets in terms of all three of the performance indicators (total length of scaffolds, maximum length of scaffolds and AUC), except for the SRS017227 data sets, SOAPdenovo2 generated slightly longer total length of scaffolds. The identification of chimeric nodes by MetaVelvet-SL using classification models generated from the taxonomic profile inferred by MetaPhlAn is shown in Supplementary Table S21.Comparisons between the taxonomic profile predicted by MetaPhlAn and the taxonomic profile based on assembly results of MetaVelvet-SL using BLAST were accomplished. The NCBI genomic reference sequences were used, which provide stable references, as the database for BLAST searching. The database contains 41,913 organisms as of September 2014 (Release 67). The numbers of species predicted by MetaPhlAn and predicted from the assembly of MetaVelvet-SL are shown in Table 6. The taxonomic profile based on assembly results covered >90% of the taxonomic profile predicted by MetaPhlAn. This result indicated that the assembly capacity of MetaVelvet-SL was high enough to capture the target diverse microbial community. As shown in Table 6, much larger number of species was predicted from assembly results by BLAST than predicted by MetaPhlAn. This is mainly because MetaPhlAn used 2,887 genomes available from the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system, which were much fewer than the number of organisms in the NCBI database used in BLAST searching. The taxonomic profile predicted by MetaPhlAn for each real data set is shown in Supplementary Tables S22–S26, whereas the taxonomy profile predicted from the assembly of MetaVelvet-SL using BLAST is shown in Supplementary Tables S27–S31.

ConclusionExtensive experiments on simulated and real metagenomic data sets showed that MetaVelvet-SL outperformed other metagenomic assemblers MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega as well as a single-genome assembler, SOAPdenovo2.The main strategy in MetaVelvet-SL is to develop a model to classify a candidate node at a crossing point between two incoming and two outgoing edges as a chimeric node or not. We also developed a procedure to identify unique nodes more precisely based on the expected coverage for each sub-graph and considered very low-coverage nodes by determining an appropriate threshold to remove error nodes. Since MetaVelvet-SL needs to learn a model for the classification of chimeric nodes, we have provided a pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL, which can generate a classification model and assemble automatically. MetaVelvet-SL also provides a library of pre-trained classification models for several typical environments such as soil, deep sea, mud, human blood, intestine and mouth.MetaVelvet-SL defines a chimeric node as a node that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. In a de Bruijn graph, in single-genome assembly, a node with multiple incoming and outgoing edges represents a repeat node. In multiple genome assembly, such node is not necessarily a repeat since it is sometimes shared between the genomes of two closely related species and represents orthologous sequences, conserved sequences (such as rRNA sequences) or horizontal transfer sequences. In a de Bruijn graph, nodes having multiple incoming and outgoing edges can be divided into (i) those with two incoming edges and two outgoing edges and (ii) those with higher order connectivity (i.e. more than two incoming edges and more than two outgoing edges). The number of nodes having higher order connectivity is much fewer than the number of nodes having two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. We counted the number of nodes having multiple incoming and outgoing edges in de Bruijn graphs for both simulated data sets and real data sets of human gut microbial short read data. On average, the number of nodes having higher order connectivity is only 1.79% of the number of nodes having two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. The number of nodes for each data set is provided in Supplementary Table S32. Although MetaVelvet-SL defines a candidate for a chimeric node as a node that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges, MetaVelvet-SL outperformed the other metagenomic assemblers MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega, and also a single genome assembler, SOAPdenovo2. We continue to consider the impact of higher order connectivity.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research in Innovative Areas No. 221S0002 and Scientific Research (A) No. 23241066 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

IntroductionTransposable elements (TEs) constitute a significant fraction of plant genomes and are considered to be one of the major forces driving genome evolution. Further, TEs are capable of changing its position in the genome through transposition and so they are called as ‘jumping genes’. Each transposition event generates new variability by creating mutations and altering the genome size of a cell. On the basis of their mode of replication and transposition, the TEs are categorized as Class I and Class II. The Class I includes retrotransposons that produce RNA intermediates which are copied into DNA and then inserted into new locations within the genome while Class II TEs are DNA transposons that move directly by a ‘cut and paste’ mechanism.1 Class I elements are further categorized into two subclasses, namely (i) LTR retrotransposons, flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs), and (2) non-LTR elements which comprise Long-Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) and Short-Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs). Retrotransposons are the most abundant mobile elements found in plant genomes,2 as the replicative mode of retroelement transposition enables the LTR retrotransposon to accrue high copy number. Indeed, in some grasses, LTR retrotransposons represent up to 90% of the genome.2,3 They constitute for >50% of the maize genome,4,5 14% of the Arabidopsis genome6 and up to 90% of the wheat genome.7 Similar to other plants, grass genomes are also rich in repetitive elements derived from retrotransposons which get amplified themselves in the genome through an RNA-mediated retrotransposition process.The wide distribution of TEs in the plant genome, abundance and their variable arrangement pattern among closely related species facilitates their use as informative marker to assess genetic diversity in plant breeding programmes. TEs-based marker system takes advantage of their transpositional activity by which they cause insertions and hence variations; and also, the presence of conserved domains facilitates designing of PCR primers. So far, five classes of TE junction-based markers have been developed which include Repeat Junction Markers (RJMs), Repeat Junction-Junction Markers (RJJMs), Insertion Site-Based Polymorphism (ISBP), Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism (IRAP) and Retrotransposon-Based Insertion Polymorphism (RBIP).8 Among these, RJMs are unique in the sense that cover both TE and gene region and hence can be useful in functional genomic studies. Development and utilization of very few insertional polymorphism-based markers were demonstrated in grass species. Wanjugi et al.9 exploited the unique and abundant TE insertion junction regions identified from diploid Aegilops tauschii to develop genome-specific repeat DNA junction markers (RJMs) for use in hexaploid wheat. Identification of repeat junctions and large-scale development of TE-based marker was also successfully performed in barley.10Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) is a C4 Panicoid grass with smaller genome (~515 Mb), in-breeding and short life cycle.11,12 These attributes along with its genetic close-relatedness to other millets, cereals and several biofuel crops have made foxtail millet a model crop.13,14 The release of draft genome sequence by BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute), China,15 and Joint Genome Institute (JGI) of the Department of Energy, USA,16 had expedited the high-throughput analysis of genome and large-scale development of genomic resources such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs),17,18 EST-derived SSRs19 and intron length polymorphic markers (ILPs).20 Considering the importance of foxtail millet, functional significance of TEs and the necessity of TE-based markers in genotyping applications, this study was performed to identify the different classes of TEs and develop molecular markers by utilizing the sequence information of TEs. Further, the developed resources are made available to the global research community through open access, web-based Foxtail millet Transposable Element-based Marker Database (FmTEMDb; http://59.163.192.83/ltrdb/index.html).2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of full-length retrotransposons and estimation of insertion timeGenomic sequence of foxtail millet was retrieved from Phytozome (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v9.0/Sitalica/), and the full-length retrotransposons were predicted using LTR_FINDER tool (http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/ltr_finder/).21 The same tool was used to identify the Target Site Repeat (TSR), Primer Binding Site (PBS) and Polypurine Tract (PPT), Integrase [IN (core) and IN (c-term)] and RNaseH (RH) region for each predicted retrotransposon. 3' and 5' LTRs were identified based on their start and end (TG and CA, respectively) using in-house Perl script with the following parameters; LTR sequence length is 100–3,500 bp, and maximum distance between LTRs is 10,000 bp.The 3' and 5' LTR sequences of the same Copia- and Gypsy-type retrotransposons were aligned by ClustalW22 using default parameters, and the pairwise sequence divergence was calculated using the Ka/Ks calculator (https://code.google.com/p/kaks-calculator/wiki/KaKs_Calculator). Based on NG parameter model,23 the Ka and Ks, the numbers of synonymous (S) and non-synonymous (N) sites (S + N = n), and the numbers of synonymous (Sd) and non-synonymous (Nd) substitutions (Sd + Nd = m) were estimated. The time of insertion was calculated as described by Tamura et al.242.2. Identification of DNA transposonsDNA transposons were identified by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker) with reference to repeat databases including Maize Transposable Element Database (maize TEDB), TIGR Gramineae Repeats v2.0, TIGR Triticum Repeats v3.0, TIGR Oryza Repeats v3.3, TIGR Hordeum Repeats v3.0, TIGR Sorghum Repeats v3.0 and Triticeae repeat (TREP) sequence database.8 BLAST search was performed in RepeatMasker using default parameters with ‘do not mask simple repeats or low-complex DNA’ option to avoid the regions of low complexity, such as simple tandem repeats, polypurines and AT-rich regions that can lead to spurious matches in database searches.2.3. Insertion of transposons into intronic regions and functional annotation of genes interrupted with TEsThe data of intronic regions were obtained from the gff file of S. italica available in Phytozome. The intronic sequences were further annotated for different classes of transposons, and nested TEs were predicted using RepeatMasker.8 Further, the genes interrupted with retrotransposons were annotated with the BLASTX algorithm using Blast2GO25 under expected value (e-value) of 1.0e-10 and minimal length cut-off value of 33 to exclude hits with minor local alignments. The Blast2GO annotation tool was used to assign the most probable Gene ontology (GO) terms to the genes, and the results were visualized by WEGO tool (Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot).262.4. Transcriptional activation of TEs in various tissues of foxtail milletTo confirm the transcriptional activities of TEs in foxtail millet, the Illumina RNA-HiSeq data of four tissues, namely spica, stem, leaf and root were retrieved from European Nucleotide Archive [SRX128226 (spica); SRX128225 (stem); SRX128224 (leaf); SRX128223 (root)].27 The RNA-seq data were then filtered and mapped onto various classes of TEs using Bowtie 1.0.0 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml). The mapped reads were analysed in all the four tissues of foxtail millet.2.5. Primer designing, PCR amplification and detection of polymorphismsUnique repeat junctions in the foxtail millet TEs were identified by executing both BLASTN search and repeat junction finding algorithm of RJPrimers pipeline v1.0 (http://probes.pw.usda.gov/RJPrimers/). The fully annotated repeat databases chosen for executing BLASTN search and identification of repeat junctions were maize TEDB (1313 sequences), TIGR Gramineae Repeats v2.0 (2,942 sequences), TIGR Triticum Repeats v3.0 (452 sequences), TIGR Oryza Repeats v3.3 (21,807 sequences), TIGR Hordeum Repeats v3.0 (630 sequences), TIGR Sorghum Repeats v3.0 (120 sequences) and TREP sequence database. E-value cut-off was set to 1e-50 for the top hit and 1e-5 was used as maximum for all the hits to reduce the detection of false-positive repeat junctions. Primer3 tool was used for designing primer pairs for the repeat junctions (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/).The primers were further validated in 96 S. italica accessions and 3 wild accessions (one each from Setaria viridis, Setaria sphacelata and Setaria verticillata) (Supplementary Table S1). Genomic DNA was extracted from the lyophilized tissue of young leaves as described by Pandey et al.17 The DNA was quantified using 0.8% agarose gel by comparing with <U+03BB>-HindIII DNA (Fermentas) as marker. The PCR amplification reactions were performed in a 25 µl reaction volume containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 1× Taq buffer, 2 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Promega), 0.5 mM each of the forward and reverse primers and four units of Taq polymerase (Biotools). The PCR reactions were performed in iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) and with one cycle of 3 min at 94°C, 34 cycles of 60 s at 94°C, 60 s at 60°C, 1.30 min at 72°C and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel. The DNA bands were eluted from the gel using Real Genomics Hi Yield Gel/PCR Fragments Extraction Kit (Real Biotech Corporation) and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a competent cells, and the plasmids were isolated from positive clones using AccuPrep Plasmid MiniPrep DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer) following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were sequenced in automated sequencer (3730xI DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) using M13 forward and reverse primers. The sequence information was used to construct multiple sequence alignment using TARGeT-based multiple sequence aligner.282.6. Phylogenetic and Bayesian model-based population structure analysisThe marker profiles of 99 accessions of Setaria species were scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of the amplicon and a binary matrix was generated. Co-migrating bands were assumed to be originated from the same genetic locus. Binary matrix was analysed using the DARwin software v5.0.158.29 Using pairwise similarity matrix of Jaccard's coefficient, the level of genetic diversity among the 99 accessions was calculated and an unweighted neighbour-joining (UNJ) tree was constructed with a bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates.30The existence of a structure was assessed using STRUCTURE 2.3.3 software,31 based on Bayesian model-based cluster analysis. The method used 99 accessions of Setaria to infer the fraction of an individual accession's genetic ancestry that belongs to a population, for a given number of populations (K). The genotype of each individual accession is a function of the allele frequencies in the K populations (clusters) and the proportion of its genotype drawn from each of the K populations (qk). The ‘no admixture model’ was tested, as recommended for dominant loci and a permutation test using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was applied to examine the population structure. For each run, the burn-in time was 2,00,000, and the number of replications was 2,00,000.32 The MCMC chain was run six times, using a correlated allele frequency model (prior mean is 0.01, prior SD = 0.05 and Lambda set at 1.0 in the advance option of the STRUCTURE program). Since it was difficult to choose the ‘correct’ K from the Ln probability of data [Ln P(D)], the <U+0394>K values were estimated as per the procedure suggested by Evanno et al.33 All the calculations pertaining to assignment of optimum K according to Evanno et al.33 were performed using Structure Harvester v0.9.94 software (http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/structureHarvester/). Maximum peak of <U+0394>K was considered as true cluster number.2.7. Comparative mapping of TEs of foxtail millet with related grass speciesThe foxtail millet TE sequences were BLASTN searched against the genomes of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon in Phytozome using default parameters. The hits with >80% similarity were taken, and the orthologues were confirmed by BLAST searching against the respective repeat databases. The comparative physical map was visualized using Circos v0.55 (http://circos.ca).342.8. Database constructionTo facilitate wider usage of these annotated TEs and the respective markers, a web-based open access database was constructed using open source softwares (Apache, PHP and MySQL). The user friendly web interface allows easy access of the TEs and TE-based marker information such as the sequences of forward and reverse primers, its respective length, melting temperature (°C) and the status of wet-lab validation. Further, the CMap feature has been integrated in the database, which enables the user to visualize the physical map of the TEs and TE-based marker (either chromosome-wise or primer types-wise). The CMap interface also allows the user to visualize the comparative map of TEs between foxtail millet chromosomes and chromosomes of sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of Class I TEs in foxtail milletClass I TEs include retrotransposons that transpose via an RNA intermediate.35 Retrotransposons are divided into two major subclasses, namely LTR retrotransposons and the non-LTR retrotransposons, which differ in their structure and transposition cycle. LTRs are further classified into Copia-like and Gypsy-like, whereas non-LTRs are categorized as LINEs and SINEs. In foxtail millet, 2,608 intact full-length LTRs were predicted using LTR_FINDER tool. These LTRs were further analysed for the presence of coding regions such as ‘gag’ that encodes capsid-like protein, ‘pol’ encoding for protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase enzymes, and ‘env’ coding for envelope protein. In addition, the sequences from coding region of some retrotransposons were extracted using in-house Perl script and were confirmed with BLASTX analysis against the non-redundant database of NCBI.Of the 2,608 LTRs, 1,038 were found to be full-length Copia type and 1,570 were full-length Gypsy type (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). In addition, partial or solo Copia-type (10,118) and Gypsy-type (23,293) retrotransposons were also identified (Fig. 1; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). The length of Copia elements ranged from 1.4 to 23.9 kb with a mean of 7,708.36 bp, whereas the length of Gypsy-type LTRs varied from 1.8 to 25.9 kb with a mean of 11,776.3 bp. The full-length LTRs were defined by the presence of two LTRs (5' and 3'; both starts and ends with TG and CA, respectively) flanking the coding regions, and PBS and PPT that vary depending on the TE family, ranging between 20 and 15 bp in length (Supplementary Fig. S2). Both the 3' and 5' LTR sequences of all LTR-type retrotransposons were extracted using in-house Perl script and analysed. The length of 3' LTRs for Copia-type retrotransposons ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 kb with a mean length of 0.99 kb, whereas the length of Gypsy-type retrotransposons varied from 0.1 to 3.46 kb with a mean of 1.14 kb. Similarly, variations in length were also observed in 5' LTRs of both Copia- and Gypsy-type retrotransposons. The length ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 kb with a mean length of 0.99 kb for Copia and 0.1 to 3.48 kb with a mean of 1.14 kb for Gypsy (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Distribution of different classes of TEs across the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet.Distribution of different classes of TEs across the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet.The non-LTRs, distinguished from LTRs by the respective absence of LTRs, were categorized as LINEs and SINEs. A total of 3,653 LINEs and 53 SINEs were identified in foxtail millet genome (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Length of LINEs ranged from 0.1 to 14.0 kb with a mean length of 1.3 kb, while the length of SINEs varied from 0.1 to 1.8 kb with a mean length of 1.5 kb.3.2. Chromosomal distribution of Class I TEs in foxtail milletAll the four subclasses of Class I TEs were evidenced to be distributed in all the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2). A maximum of Copia-type TEs are present in chromosome 8 (~14%; ~3.6 TEs per Mb) and minimum in chromosome 7 (6.5%; ~2 TEs per Mb). Average distribution of Copia-type TE in foxtail millet genome is 2.6 per Mb (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). In case of Gypsy, a maximum of 199 elements were present in chromosome 4 (~13%) and minimum in chromosome 7 (~8%). Maximum density of Gypsy-type TEs was found in chromosome 6 (~5 per Mb) and minimum was observed in chromosome 9 (~3 per Mb) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). Foxtail millet chromosome 9 comprised the maximum number of LINEs (532; 14.5%) and chromosome 2 had the minimum (233; ~5%). The density of LINEs was maximum in chromosome 6 (10.5 per Mb) and minimum in chromosome 2 (~5 per Mb) (Supplementary Table S6). In case of SINEs, maximum of these elements were observed in chromosome 11 (~21%) and minimum in chromosome 7 (~6%) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S7).3.3. Estimation of LTR insertion timeInsertion time of LTRs in the foxtail millet genome was calculated to predict the time taken for the occurrence of each transposition events, which facilitates the movement of LTRs from one position to another in the genome. For Copia-type elements, the distribution of the divergence time ranged from 0.000767 to 3.93273 MYA (million years ago) with a mean value of 1.28 MYA (Supplementary Table S8). The distribution of the divergence time for Gypsy-type retrotransposons was estimated to be in a range of 0.000371–6.7687 MYA with a mean value of 0.82 (Supplementary Table S9). These results are in agreement with the previous studies where the insertion timings are reported in a range of 0.00–6.00 MYA.36–38 In rice, it was reported that 263 LTR-RTs (5%) have insertion dates <14,000 yrs old, which is approximately the time of rice domestication.39–41 Further, the Ka/Ks ratios estimated as >1 signified that LTRs have underwent positive selection. This positive selection at the DNA level could have resulted from the ability of TE sequences to replicate faster than the host genome.3.4. Identification of Class II type TEs and its distribution in foxtail millet genomeA total of 24,386 DNA transposons belonging to Class II type TEs were identified in foxtail millet (Supplementary Table S10). The lengths of these TEs varied from 0.1 to 14.7 kb with a mean length of 0.78 kb. The 22,860 DNA transposons were further classified into 10 subclasses, namely DNA/CMC-EnSpm, DNA/En-Spm, DNA/hAT-Ac, DNA/hAT-Tag1, DNA/hAT-Tip100, DNA/MULE-MuDR, DNA/PIF-Harbinger, DNA/TcMar-Stowaway, RC/Helitron and DNA/Tourist based on similarity search with known TEs reported in other plant species. Of these, DNA/PIF-Harbinger accounts for the highest of Class II type TEs (12,758; ~52%), followed by DNA/CMC-EnSpm (4,979; ~20%). DNA/hAT-Tag1 (31) and DNA/Tourist (28) were found to be least in number, amounting for 0.1% of the Class II TEs identified in foxtail millet (Supplementary Table S10).Chromosomal distribution data of these 24,386 DNA transposons revealed that a maximum of 3,901 were present in chromosome 9 (16%) and minimum in chromosome 2 (1,366; ~28%) (Fig. 1). Higher density of Class II TEs was evidenced in chromosome 5 (~71 per Mb) and lower in chromosome 2 (~28 per Mb) with an average density of 61 DNA transposons per Mb (Supplementary Table S10).3.5. Transcriptional activation of TEs in various tissues of foxtail milletRetrotransposons were found to be transcriptionally active in all the four tissues, namely leaf, root, spica and stem (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables S11–S15). A maximum of Copia-type TEs (~80%) matched with RNA-HiSeq reads which revealed that Copia-type TEs were prevalently expressed in tissues of foxtail millet. Approximately 49% of Gypsy-type retrotransposons matched with RNA-HiSeq reads. Similarly, ~10% LINEs, ~15% SINEs and ~16% DNA transposons matched with the expressed reads (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables S11–S15).

Development of TE-based markersAll the 30,706 identified foxtail millet TEs were searched for potential repeat junctions (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). Based on repeat junction, six types of primers were designed, namely retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP), IRAP, RJM, RJJM, ISBP and retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) (Supplementary Tables S16–S21). Hence, a total of 20,278 primers were successfully designed, of which maximum was the ISBP (7,401; ~36%) followed by RBIP (4,801; ~24%). Only 57 primers could be designed for REMAP (~0.2%). The numbers of IRAP, RJM and RJJM primers were 3,239 (~16%), 4,451 (~22%) and 329 (~2%), respectively (Supplementary Tables S16–S21). Although these markers were expected to include the fragments between the TE sequence on one side and the TE-inserted unique gene sequence on the other, some of the primers were evidenced to show same conformation at different locations in foxtail millet genome. This generation of duplications is due to the RJPrimer tool, using which the TE-based markers were developed.Although primers could not be designed for LINEs and SINEs using Primer3 because of the limitations in their lengths, three RJM primers were manually designed for LINEs by aligning foxtail millet CDS on genomic sequences using GeneSeqer tool.42 In addition, the TE-based forward and reverse primers were BLAST searched with available draft foxtail millet chromosomal pseudomolecule sequences to know their uniqueness/specificity in the foxtail genome. The results indicated that 1,522 (~21%) of ISBP, 1,012 (~21%) of RBIP, 712 (~16%) of RJM, 546 (~17%) of IRAP, 91 (~28%) of RJJM and 8 (~14%) of REMAP were unique.3.7. Amplification and polymorphic potential of TE-based markersA total of 134 RJM primers were selected representing the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet for validation. Initially, all the 134 primer pairs were amplified in 96 accessions of S. italica and 3 wild Setaria (S. viridis, S. sphacelata and S. verticillata) accessions to examine the insertional polymorphism among these accessions (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S22). Of these, 104 (~78%) amplified unique single allele, whereas 30 primers (~22%) amplified more than single allele and was evidenced to be polymorphic. The amplicons showing polymorphism were sequenced and compared with the reference genome available in Phytozome to confirm whether all the sequences of 30 polymorphic primer pairs show complete similarity with amplified sequences (Fig. 4; Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). The relative frequencies of Gene Ontology (GO) hits assigned to the GO functional categories; Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component for Setaria italica genes which were interrupted with transposable elements. ‘DNA TEs’ indicates DNA transposons; ‘LTR’ represents Copia and Gypsy-type retrotransposons and ‘NonLTR’ indicates LINEs and SINEs.The relative frequencies of Gene Ontology (GO) hits assigned to the GO functional categories; Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component for Setaria italica genes which were interrupted with transposable elements. ‘DNA TEs’ indicates DNA transposons; ‘LTR’ represents Copia and Gypsy-type retrotransposons and ‘NonLTR’ indicates LINEs and SINEs.Frequency of transcriptionally active transposable elements present in four tissues of foxtail millet.Frequency of transcriptionally active transposable elements present in four tissues of foxtail millet.3.8. Identification of TEs present in intronic regions and functional annotation of genes interrupted with TEsTEs are reported to play a crucial role in gene evolution by disrupting the genes. Upon getting integrated into the genome, TEs mediate chromosomal rearrangements, leading to accumulation of mutations and ultimately become transpositionally inactive. The presence of TEs was searched in the introns of 45,735 protein-coding genes of foxtail millet. Approximately 12% genes of foxtail millet were found to be integrated with TEs, of which ~0.75% genes had Copia-type retrotransposons, ~1% genes had Gypsy type, ~3% genes had LINEs and ~6% genes were interrupted with DNA transposons (Table 1). LINEs (1,497 interrupted genes) and DNA transposons (830 genes with PIF-Harbinger and 635 genes with TcMar-Stowaway) were observed to be predominantly integrated within genic region. Similar phenomenon of TE insertion in intronic region was also observed in sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium (Fig. 5; Table 1). Further, the patterns of the nested TEs (the insertion of TEs into pre-existing TEs) for all the types of retrotransposons were analysed. A total of 4,927 inserted TEs were found to be inserted within 2,078 host TEs, thus revealing that >1 TE inserted into a single host TE. Of the total inserted TEs, 6.3% (308) was found to be inserted in RC/Helitron, 13.66% (673) in DNA/CMC-EnSpm, 11.26% (555) in DNA/En-Spm, 0.37% (18) in DNA/hAT-Ac, 0.30% (15) in DNA/MULE-MuDR, 0.41% (20) in DNA/TcMar-Stowaway, 3.75% (185) in DNA/PIF-Harbinger, 0.26%, (13) in DNA/Tourist, 0.52% (26) in LINE/L1, 26.91% (1,326) in Copia and 36.28% (1,788) in Gypsy (Supplementary Fig. S8). It has been reported that the movement of TEs in genomes results in the occurrence of nested TEs.43 These nested TEs in foxtail millet genome may negatively influence genome expansion and enrich the diversity of gene expression or regulation.

The analysis revealed that predominant genes were involved in organ development (Fig. 6). Further chromatin regulatory genes containing SET domain gene family and AGO gene family which are the components of RNAi machinery were identified as the genes interrupted with TEs. Three genes namely RJM3, RJM4 and RJM7 that are interrupted with TEs were validated in Setaria species. Of these, RJM7 showed insertion of LINE-type transposons in 21st intron of EIF2ALPHA KINASE gene in S. italica as it acts as Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase (eif2-alpha kinase) in plants (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, there was no insertional signature observed in S. verticillata.

Phylogenetic and Bayesian model-based population structure analysisTo analyse the diversity among diverse germplasm of 99 Setaria accessions, a dendogram was generated from a similarity matrix using NJ clustering method. Unrooted NJ method resolved them into four major subgroups. Group 1 contains the largest number of individuals that were mostly originated from USA, whereas Group 2 comprises the accessions from India. Groups 3 and 4 predominantly comprise accessions from USA and China, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9).The TE-based marker data of 99 accessions of Setaria were also analyzed for the genetic structure. The software was run for the number of fixed subgroups (K) from 2 to 12, and more than three runs were performed for each K (Supplementary Table S23) and <U+0394>K was estimated. Structure Harvester software based on Evanno method has delineated the optimum number of K as 4 (Supplementary Fig. S10; Supplementary Table S24). Similar to Hierarchical analysis, Bayesian model-based cluster analysis revealed that the 99 individuals were clustered into four groups, A–D (K = 4) (Supplementary Fig. S11). These individuals were further classified into the ones with ‘pure’ ancestry (where >80% of their inferred ancestry was derived from only one of the clusters) and ‘mixed ancestry’ or ‘admixtures’ (where >20% of inferred ancestry was derived from more than one cluster). Majority of the accessions (76) belonged to the ‘pure’ ancestry (Supplementary Table S25). The remaining accessions were of ‘mixed’ ancestry. A comparison of the results from Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis with the NJ-based tree revealed considerable congruence. Two out of the four STRUCTURE-based clusters matched with the specific groups of the NJ-based tree. However, Clusters 2 and 3 were the exceptions, where the accessions from NJ-based group were not contributed to correspondence group. By understanding the ISBP due to RJM, analysing the evolutionary aspects is possible using phylogenetic approach. These markers were also proved successful in analysing genetic diversity analysis and construction of physical and genetic linkage maps in wheat.9 The major advantage of RJM is that it indicates the insertion polymorphism where different allelic states (the presence and absence of the transposon insertion) at a locus are revealed.44 Because of this unique advantage, RJMs are used in genetic, physical and radiation mapping studies.93.10. TE-based comparative mapping between foxtail millet and related grass speciesTE-based comparative orthologous relationships between 30,706 foxtail millet TEs and TEs of sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium were analysed (Fig. 7; Supplementary Tables S26–S29). Of the 30,706 TEs, 14,008 (~46%) showed maximum synteny with sorghum, 12,485 (~40%) with maize, 9,634 (~31%) with rice and 1,313 (~4%) with Brachypodium. The data revealed a decrease in the degree of synteny with respect to increase in the phylogenetic distance. Interestingly, TEs mapped in foxtail millet chromosome 9 showed highest synteny with all the four grass species [2,419 (~17%) with sorghum, 2,103 (~17%) with maize, 1,666 (~17%) with rice and 205 (~16%) with Brachypodium] (Fig. 7). Similarly, TEs mapped in chromosome 2 of foxtail millet showed minimum synteny with all the four grasses [777 (~5%) with sorghum, 715 (~6%) with maize, 510 (~5%) with rice and 69 (~5%) with Brachypodium] (Supplementary Tables S26–S29). The wider genetic distances and low syntenic relationships among foxtail millet and other monocot genomes based on TE-based markers could be explained either through low conservation of TEs and/or species-specific transpositions. The independent evolutionary and divergence patterns of TEs have led to evolve unique transposition patterns in diverse crop lineages for generation of species-specific TEs resulting in their low conservation and synteny. This TE-based comparative mapping provides insights on the TEs in sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium and would enable map-based isolation and analysis of TEs in these grass species.

Online web-resource implementation and user interfaceUsing the three-level schema of Apache, PHP and MySQL, open access Foxtail millet Transposable Element-based Marker Database (FmTEMDb; http://59.163.192.83/ltrdb/index.html) was constructed (Fig. 8). The database is a repository of complete TE data along with respective marker information. The details of TEs can be searched using six different search criteria such as TE IDs, type of TE, chromosome, etc. For each TE, the database will provide preliminary information of TE ID, chromosomal location, orientation of the coding strand, subclass (if any) and hyperlinks to retrieve the primers and view the physical map. Under primer details, the database will display the primer type, junction, TE type, TE source, strand orientation, start and end position of primers, melting temperature and GC percentage. The CMap feature of FmTEMDb allows the interactive visualization of physical and comparative map of TEs (Fig. 9). The map could be browsed either by type of TE or chromosome-wise. Further, all the data stored in the database are available for download. Although the database is user friendly, a tutorial is also provided (Supplementary Fig. S12).

ConclusionsTEs are one of the major components of the plant genome, and they are reported to play a crucial role in functional genome diversity and phenotypic variations. Hence, analysing the organization of TEs in the genome would enable the researchers in dissecting the interplay between TEs and nearby gene expression which would enhance understanding the role of TEs in shaping the crop phenotypic diversity. The advent of next-generation sequencing and high-throughput sequence analysis platforms had facilitated the whole-genome sequencing and analysis of important crop plants. With the availability of genome sequence information, it is possible to investigate the organization of TEs in the genome. Further, the polymorphic potential of several types of TEs such as retrotransposons had encouraged the development of TE-based molecular markers that are useful for high-throughput genotyping applications.45 The major cause of genome evolution is because of the TEs, which has generated genetic diversity upon which selection can act. Further, TE transposition is also an important factor for nucleotide-base mutation rate, and thus, TEs serve as potential agents of evolutionary changes. TEs also induce phenotypic changes associated with domestication or diversification of cultivated plants. It also causes gene disruption by creating insertion or deletion in exon or intron region, which could be the major force towards the differential expression and regulation of gene.Foxtail millet is a model crop for studying the genetics and genomics of several millets, cereals and bioenergy grasses.13,14 Hence, identifying the TEs, classifying and analysing its organization, and developing TE-based molecular markers in foxtail millet would serve as an important resource for millets, cereals and bioenergy genomics. Considering this, the present study was performed to identify a total of 30,706 TEs in foxtail millet and is classified into respective classes and subclasses. Further, the TEs present in intronic regions were identified, and functional annotation of respective genes was performed. Using the RNA-sequence data of four tissues, the transcriptional activation of TEs was analysed, and comparative physical mapping of foxtail millet TEs with sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium was performed. From 30,706 TEs, 20,278 markers were developed which belonged to six types. Of these, 134 RJMs were screened in 96 accessions of S. italica and 3 wild Setaria accessions of which 30 showed polymorphism. To provide the developed TE information to the global science community, a web-based, open access database (FmTEMDb; http://59.163.192.83/ltrdb/index.html) was constructed. Promisingly, the TE data of foxtail millet along with the large-scale marker information reported in this study will be a valuable resource for foxtail millet genomic studies including genomic selection, fine mapping and phylogenetic analysis. Further, this would also assist in gaining new insights on the genome structure of this model crop as well as the potential of TEs in genetic variation studies.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe authors' work in this area was supported by the core grant of National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi, India.

IntroductionThe cultivation of olive trees (Olea europaea L.) dates back to ancient times. Mythology ascribes the domestication of this species to a divine will: the cultivation of the tree and the treatment of the drupe were taught to the people of Athens by the goddess Athena. In recent years, olive cultivation has been subjected to a growing interest because of the economic, cultural, and ecological importance of olive trees in the Mediterranean area. This interest has grown even outside the Mediterranean area because of health properties of olive oil, related to its composition of fatty acids and secondary metabolites.1From a genetic point of view, this renewed interest in olive tree cultivation has primarily resulted in data on the large genetic variability occurring within O. europaea and related species.2 Such a large genetic variability can be explained by the prevalent self-incompatibility of olive genotypes, which results in high levels of heterozygosis and DNA polymorphisms. Owing to spontaneous crossings and to the appearance of bud sports over the course of millennia, numerous new genotypes appeared, the best of which were fixed by agamic propagation.3Olea europaea L. has a medium-sized haploid genome of 1.4 Gb,4 whose structure has been long uncharacterized. Concerning the repetitive component of the genome, before 2014 only four tandem repeat sequences had been characterized and localized by cytological hybridization on chromosomes.5–7 In addition, a few putative retrotransposon (RE) fragments were isolated and sequenced.8,9After sequencing the whole genome of some plant species, the knowledge of the structure and organization of plant genomes has been substantially improved, leading to the view that genome evolution of angiosperms has been accompanied—and possibly promoted—by polyploidization events and differential amplification of repetitive DNA.10The repetitive DNA in plants is mainly represented by Class I transposons (REs) that are capable of replicating through a ‘copy and paste’ mechanism and can potentially increase the genome size of their host species in a very short time.11Among REs, elements that contain direct long terminal repeats (LTRs) are predominant in plants. LTR-REs vary in size from a few hundred base pairs to over 10 kb, with LTRs that usually contain the promoter and RNA processing signals.12 Internal to the 5' and 3' LTRs, respectively, are the primer-binding site (PBS) and the polypurine tract (PPT), which provide the signals for reverse transcription of RE transcripts into the cDNA that will be reintegrated into the genome. In autonomous elements, these two sequence sites flank the region that contains ORFs for Gag, a structural protein of the virus-like particles, and for Pol. Pol encodes a polyprotein with protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), RNaseH, and integrase enzyme domains, which are required for the replication and the integration of the elements in the host chromosomes.LTR-REs belong to two major superfamilies, called Gypsy and Copia, differing in the position of the integrase domain within the encoded polyprotein.The occurrence of different RE families, characterized by sequence variability in both the coding, transcribed portion and the LTRs13 has been reported in several genomes. These families were probably generated by the replicative mechanism of LTR-REs, coupled with the error-prone nature of transcription and reverse transcription. RE families have amplified differentially in different lineages within plant genera or even within a single species (for example, in maize) over a time-span of <1 million yrs (MY).14 Similar events have taken place in several cereal species: for example, in the genome of Sorghum bicolor, the insertion of transposable elements and their removal by unequal recombination or by DNA loss resulted in an average RE insertion age of 0.8 MY, with 50% of the detected elements having inserted within the last 500,000 yrs.15 Such processes have also been detected in some dicots, although to a less dramatic extent.11,16,17Recently, next-generation sequencing technologies and different computational procedures have been used to gain a general insight into the composition of the olive genome and its repetitive fraction.18 Illumina and 454 reads from genomic DNA were assembled following different procedures, obtaining >200,000 differently redundant contigs, with a mean length of >1,000 nt. By combining identification and mapping of repeated sequences, it was established that tandem repeats represent a very large portion of the olive genome (~31%), consisting of six main families of different length. The other large redundant class in the olive genome is represented by transposable elements, especially LTR-REs.18The identification and characterization of olive LTR-REs were, however, difficult because of the lack of large sequenced genomic regions. For example, an accurate dating of amplification events of the LTR-RE component requires a comparison of the two LTR sequences from individual, full-length elements.19In the frame of a project aimed to sequence the olive genome, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was produced. A number of BAC clones were pooled and then sequenced using the Illumina procedure. These sequences were assembled and the resulting contigs analysed to identify full-length LTR-REs, allowing the first characterization of such elements in olive, especially in relation to their insertion age.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing of BAC clonesA BAC library from O. europaea cv. Leccino was produced as follows. Cell nuclei were isolated from the youngest leaves of the olive tree following the protocol of Doležel et al.20 Briefly, the leaves were fixed for 20 min at 5°C in 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and immediately afterwards chopped by a razor blade in ice-cold isolation buffer (15 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 130 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM spermine, 1 mM spermidine, 45 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 9.4). The suspension of released nuclei was passed through a 50-µm-pore nylon mesh to remove large tissue and cellular fragments, and was then stained using DAPI (2 µg/ml). Intact nuclei were sorted using flow cytometry and used to prepare high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA.21 HMW DNA of 1.8 million nuclei (~5.4 µg DNA) was used to construct a large insert library cloned in pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) as previously described.22We shotgun-sequenced 12 pools each formed by 384 BACs (corresponding to 12,384-well library plates) for a total of 4,608 clones using the Illumina procedure. DNA from each plate pool was prepared using the Illustra TempliPhi Large Construct V2 kit (Resnova). Each BAC pool was then individually assembled as described below.Paired-end libraries were prepared by using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced in two lanes on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the 12-plex level of multiplexing, producing from 30 to 50 million reads per pool (paired-end 100-nt set-up). The processing of fluorescent images into sequences, base-calling, and quality value calculations was performed using the Illumina data-processing pipeline (version 1.8.2).Illumina reads were then processed to remove adapters using Cutadapt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cutadapt/1.4.2, 12 November 2014, date last accessed),23 with default parameters except -O 10 -n 2 -m 50 and finally paired again using an internally developed Python script. To trim low-quality regions and to remove bacterial contaminants and olive chloroplast sequence, reads were further processed with ERNE-FILTER (http://erne.sourceforge.net, 12 November 2014, date last accessed) using default parameters except–min-size 50 and —errors-rate 25.Illumina reads from each individual BAC pool were assembled using ABySS24 with the following parameters: k = 71, l = 1, aligner = map, b = 1,000,000, P = 0.95, s = 500, n = 10. An internally developed Perl script was used to remove scaffolds shorter than 500 nt.2.2. Identification of full-length LTR-REsAssembled contigs longer than 10,000 nt were surveyed for the identification of full-length LTR-REs based on structural features and sequence similarity to the Olea RE database18 and to public sequence databases (non-redundant nucleotide and protein NCBI databases, RepBase database).Structural features were identified using the LTR-FINDER25 and DOTTER26 software. Alignment boundaries were obtained by adjusting the ends of LTR-pair candidates using the Smith–Waterman algorithm. These boundaries were re-adjusted based on the occurrence of typical LTR-RE features that include the following: being flanked by the dinucleotides TG and CA at 5' and 3' ends, respectively; the presence of a target-site duplication (TSD) of 4–6 nt; a putative 15- to 18-nt PBS, complementary to a tRNA at the end of the putative 5'-LTR; and a 20- to 25-nt PPT just upstream of the 5' end of the 3' LTR.All putative LTR-REs were subsequently annotated by BLASTX and BLASTN against the public non-redundant databases at NCBI, and by RepeatMasker against the RepeatExplorer-based database of olive-repeated sequences.18 To limit false-positive detection, we used a fixed E-value threshold of E < 10-5 for BLASTN and E < 10-10 for BLASTX. The full-length REs that were identified as belonging to Gypsy or Copia superfamilies were then used as a reference database for a further BLASTN search, in order to classify previously unclassified elements.In other analyses, 10,000 nt upstream and downstream of each LTR-RE was subjected, whenever possible, to a BLAST search to identify other sequences (coding and/or non-coding) occurring in proximity of each RE.2.3. Estimation of LTR-RE abundanceTo estimate the redundancy of the LTR-RE set and of the Gypsy and Copia superfamilies, a large set of Illumina whole-genome shotgun reads (total coverage 8.1×)18 was mapped onto all isolated elements, using CLC-BIO Genomic Workbench 6.5.1, with the following parameters: mismatch cost = 1, deletion cost = 1, insertion cost = 1, similarity = 0.9, and length fraction = 0.9. To obtain reads of constant length, all bases exceeding 75 nt were cut. In this analysis, multireads (i.e. those reads that matched multiple distinct sequences) were distributed randomly, and hence, the number of mapped reads to a single sequence would be only an indication of its redundancy. On the other hand, if all sequences of a sequence class are taken together, the total number of mapped reads (in respect to total genomic reads) reveals the effective redundancy of that class.The redundancy level of each single sequence was estimated by mapping the same large set of Illumina whole-genome shotgun reads as above onto each isolated RE, one by one. Redundancy values are reported as the number of mapped reads per kb of sequence length.In other analyses, in order to evaluate the occurrence of solo-LTRs, the same read set was mapped onto each isolated RE one by one, keeping the 5'-LTR and the inter-LTR region separated.2.4. Phylogenetic analysesFull-length LTR-REs were scored for retrotranscriptase, RNAseH, and integrase domains of Gypsy and Copia elements—separately—using TBLASTN against an internally developed library of RE proteins. All sequences of at least 80 amino acids were collected and aligned using CLUSTALW,27 and a tree was generated. The tree was visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/, 12 November 2014, date last accessed).2.5. Insertion age calculation of full-length LTR-REsRE insertion age was estimated comparing the 5'- and 3'-LTRs of each putative RE. The two LTRs of a single RE are identical at the time of insertion because they are copied from the same template.A synonymous substitution rate was calculated comparing 20 protein-coding sequences (longer than 200 nt, putatively nuclear, and unique) of another species belonging to the Oleaceae family, Fraxinus excelsior (The British Ash Tree Genome Project, http://www.ashgenome.org/, 12 November 2014, date last accessed) to orthologous sequences of O. europaea, selected from an available olive transcriptome.28 Rates of synonymous nucleotide substitution for each gene sequence were calculated by the method of Nei and Gojobori29 with the Jukes–Cantor correction as implemented in the DnaSP program.30 As the estimated separation between Olea and Fraxinus is dated to between 40 and 45 MY ago,31 42.5 MY was used for estimating the synonymous nucleotide substitution rate.The two LTRs of each full-length RE were aligned with the ClustalW software,26 indels were eliminated, and the number of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site was calculated using an internally developed pipeline. As proposed by Ma and Bennetzen,32 we used twice the mean number of synonymous substitutions per site per year as the nucleotide substitution rate between LTRs. Based on this rate, the insertion time for each full-length RE was estimated.3. Results3.1. Isolation and annotation of full-length LTR-REsThe BAC library consisted of 44,928 clones with an average insert size of 112 kb. Considering the 1C genome size of O. europaea cv. Leccino (1.49 Gb, determined by DNA flow cytometry; J. Cížková, personal communication), the library should represent 3.3 genome equivalents.We sequenced a total of 4,608 clones in pools of 384 and, after assembly of each individual pool, we selected all contigs longer than 10 kb (275, for a total of 7,653,690 nt). These were scored for the occurrence of putative full-length LTR-REs, searching for structural features and sequence similarities, that is, the occurrence of two relatively intact LTRs, of identified PPT and PBS sites, and of flanking TSDs.A set of 254 putative full-length REs was isolated from 245 over 275 contigs (1 RE from each of 236 contigs and 2 REs from each of 9 contigs). We defined full-length elements based on the occurrence of intact ends, irrespective of whether these elements were potentially functional or contained inactivating mutations in their internal sequence (Table 1). Many sequences showed all distinctive structural features of REs, although in some cases one feature was missing. Mean characteristics of Copia, Gypsy, and unknown putative full-length retroelements identified in the BAC clonesMean characteristics of Copia, Gypsy, and unknown putative full-length retroelements identified in the BAC clonesThe isolated REs covered a total of 1,584,566 nt over 7,653,690 nt, with a mean length of 6226.5 nt. They were classified as Gypsy or Copia according to BLAST searches against NCBI, RepBase,33 and OLEAREP18 databases and to a subsequent BLAST search using the same olive REs as a reference database.The majority of isolated full-length REs belonged to the Copia superfamily (166), followed by the Gypsy superfamily (81, of which 36 contained an integrase chromodomain34). Seven REs were classified as unknown because they lacked distinctive protein-coding sequences suitable for classifying the element. For 222, 171, and 253 elements, the putative TSD, PBS, and PPT were identified, respectively. Seventy-two elements showed all typical protein domains of LTR-REs. The main features of each isolated RE are reported in Supplementary Data S1.Sequences adjacent to isolated REs were also scored for similarity to other genic or non-genic sequences. The occurrence of putative genes and transposon-related sequences is summarized in Table 2. In many cases (99 REs, 38.93%), the isolated full-length REs lied in proximity of gene sequences. Ninety-five REs (37.40%) were close to REs or DNA transposon fragments. Only 16 REs (6.30%) were flanked at both sides by transposon fragments, possibly representing loci with nested elements.

Genomic redundancy of isolated LTR-REsConsidering the percentage of Illumina reads that matched to a class of sequences as an indicator of the proportion of that class in the olive genome, previous experiments18 indicated that LTR-REs account for 38.8% of the olive genome. Using the same set of reads for mapping the 254 REs isolated from BAC clones, we found that they were mapped by 17,107,830 reads, corresponding to 12.3% of the genome, that is, these REs represent around one-third of the RE population in the genome.Mapping results of the different RE superfamilies are summarized in Fig. 1. In a previous work on olive genome,18 the ratio between redundancy of Gypsy and Copia REs was 1.17. In the RE sample described here, the ratio is quite different, amounting to 0.92, indicating that the REs identified in this study do not represent the whole olive RE set. However, it is worth noting that, although Gypsy full-length elements are only 81 versus 166 Copia elements, they are mapped by a number of reads similar to that mapping to the Copia REs. This result confirms that, in the olive genome, the number of Gypsy families is lower than that of Copia, but Gypsy REs are more redundant than Copia REs.18Number of full-length REs identified in this study, separated according to their superfamily. Each bar in the histogram shows the number of Illumina reads that matched to all REs (height) and the number of REs (width) of each superfamily.Number of full-length REs identified in this study, separated according to their superfamily. Each bar in the histogram shows the number of Illumina reads that matched to all REs (height) and the number of REs (width) of each superfamily.The distribution of the number of mapped reads of isolated Gypsy and Copia REs is reported in Fig. 2. Gypsy elements showed a larger mean and distribution around the mean compared with Copia.

The boxes represent the 25–75%, whiskers represent the whole range of values, and lines in the box represent the mean values of the distribution.To estimate the equilibrium between RE replication and RE loss, Illumina reads were mapped onto each full-length LTR-RE, keeping LTR sequences separate from the respective inter-LTR region. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3. Distribution of full-length olive LTR-REs according to the ratio between the number of mapped reads per kb measured separately on LTR and inter-LTR regions.Distribution of full-length olive LTR-REs according to the ratio between the number of mapped reads per kb measured separately on LTR and inter-LTR regions.The ratio between the numbers of mapped reads per kb between the 5'-LTR and the respective inter-LTR DNA sequence ranged from 0.003 to 20.52. If all REs belonging to the same family were intact, that is, composed of two LTRs and one inter-LTR region, the ratio should have been 2. Conservatively, we considered the occurrence of solo-LTRs only for those LTR-REs whose ratio was higher than 2.5. Only a small number of REs showed ratios higher than 2.5 (16 of 254—eight Gypsy, seven Copia, and one unknown element), and only three showed ratios higher than 10.Many LTR-REs showed a ratio lower than 2 (Fig. 3), that is, the inter-LTR region was more represented in the genome than in the LTR. This result suggests the presence of different families that share, at least in part, the inter-LTR region and show a higher level of sequence conservation of the pol protein-coding domains. Interestingly, Fig. 3 suggests that this aspect is especially true for Copia REs.Finally, one Copia and two Gypsy elements showed the highest ratio between the numbers of mapped reads per kb of the LTR and inter-LTRs (Fig. 3), indicating that unequal homologous recombination has particularly affected elements similar to these two REs. The Copia RE shows sequence similarity to Ale retroelements of other species and it is medium redundant. Both Gypsy REs show similarity to chromodomain-containing Res, and the estimated redundancy of the full-length forms of them is very high.3.3. Phylogenetic relationships among isolated LTR-REsPhylogenetic analyses were performed by the neighbour-joining method to evaluate the relationship between isolated LTR-REs. Two phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the transcribed putative retrotranscriptase sequence of 93 Copia and 43 Gypsy REs (Figs 4 and 5). The bootstrap values suggest the occurrence of distinct families, indicated in the figures by different colours.

The letter S indicates two Gypsy REs with an LTR/inter-LTR ratio of >10.The redundancy of each element is also reported in Figs 4 and 5. Within each family, especially for the Gypsy superfamily, different elements often showed similar redundancy. In many cases, the least redundant Copia elements did not cluster in the tree. In contrast, Gypsy unclustered elements were generally highly redundant. It should be noted that 9 of 20 Copia elements with mapped reads/kb >15,000 are reported in the retrotranscriptase tree, all belonging to the same, large cluster. In the other cases, they did not carry the RT-encoding domain. Using other RE protein domains, seven more Copia elements with mapped reads/kb >15,000 resulted in the same cluster (data not shown), indicating that the most redundant elements of this superfamily share some sequence similarity. Four of 20 most redundant REs did not carry protein domains, hence their relationship to the other sequences remained unknown.3.4. Putative insertion dates of LTR-REsIntact retroelements have a built-in molecular clock that is useful for estimating their insertion times, based on sister LTR divergence. In fact, when an RE is inserted into the genome, its LTRs are usually 100% identical. Considering that the retroelement transcription starts from the R region in the 5'-LTR and terminates at the end of the R region in the 3'-LTR (thus including only one copy of each U5 and U3 regions), the combination of single copy U5 and U3 regions with a hybrid R region during reverse transcription into cDNA yields two identical LTRs at both ends, prior to integration.12 Mutations then occur within the two LTRs, and as more time passes since the insertion, the larger the genetic distance between LTRs becomes. Hence, the RE insertion time can be estimated using a nucleotide substitution rate suitable for such elements, which is assumed to be higher than that of gene regions.32We estimated the synonymous substitution rate of genes in O. europaea by comparing orthologous cDNA sequences of O. europaea and F. excelsior (a species belonging to the Oleaceae family, for which a large amount of sequence data are available; Buggs and Sollars, personal communication), that is, 20 coding sequences for a total of 7,282 nt in O. europaea and 6,552 nt in Fraxinus (Supplementary Table S1). The mean number of synonymous substitutions per site (Ks) was 0.077.Based on the separation between the olive and the ash tree, estimated to be ~42.5 MY,31 the resulting synonymous substitution rate is 1.8 × 10-9, which is lower than those reported for herbaceous species, and similar to those of other perennial tree species.17,35 In fact, it is known that the generation time of a species affects its nucleotide substitution rate36 and trees have a much longer generation time than herbaceous species.It was proposed that mutation rates for LTR-REs may be approximately 2-fold higher than synonymous substitution rates for protein-coding genes.32 Consequently, in our calculations of LTR-RE insertion dates, we used a substitution rate per year of 3.6 × 10-9.The sequences of LTR pairs were compared and the putative insertion times were calculated for each full-length LTR-RE. Taking into account the whole set of full-length REs, the nucleotide distance (Ks) between sister LTRs showed a large variation between retroelements, representing a time-span of, at most, 46 MY. The putative mean age of analysed LTR-REs was 17.94 MY (standard error = 0.54 MY). The distribution of full-length LTR-REs according to their putative insertion date is reported in Fig. 6. Distributions of full-length REs identified in this study, according to their estimated insertion ages (MY). Mean insertion dates are reported in parentheses.Distributions of full-length REs identified in this study, according to their estimated insertion ages (MY). Mean insertion dates are reported in parentheses.Analysis of the insertion date profiles provides evidence for a partial overlap among retrotransposition waves of Gypsy and Copia full-length LTR-REs. For example, taking into consideration the last 7 MY, nearly all retrotransposition events involve Copia elements. On the other hand, Gypsy-related elements show a large peak of retrotransposition between 10 and 25 MY ago, in contrast to Copia REs, whose retrotransposition activity is scattered over the last 40 MY.Interestingly, two REs (one Copia and one Gypsy) did not show variations between their LTRs, suggesting that insertion should have occurred between 0 and 1.760 MY ago and between 0 and 0.387 MY ago, respectively, that is, the retrotransposition process could still be active.The relationship between the insertion age of an RE and its redundancy in the genome is shown in Fig. 7, and indicates the intensity of retrotransposition activity in the period in which retrotransposition has occurred, although the case that the insertion time of an element cannot correspond to the period of largest activity of its RE family cannot be ruled out. The relationship between estimated insertion ages (MY) and the redundancy of full-length REs identified in this study.The relationship between estimated insertion ages (MY) and the redundancy of full-length REs identified in this study.Figure 7 suggests that intense retrotransposition waves have occurred, for some RE families of both superfamilies, between 10 and 30 MY ago. One Gypsy and two Copia families may have been especially active between 23 and 29 MY ago.4. DiscussionThe repetitive component of the olive genome amounts to >70%.18 Around 30% of the genome is made of tandem repeat sequences and 40% of transposable elements. Such a genome composition appears to be peculiar to O. europaea. In other species, tandem repeats account for <10% of the genome, with the exception of the genome of cucumber,37 which is composed of ~23% of such sequences, a percentage, however, lower than that measured in the olive genome. In plant species other than olive, transposable elements account for the vast majority of the repetitive component. The partial replacement of REs by tandem repeats in the olive genome prompted us to study the dynamics of LTR-REs in this species.We analysed olive LTR-REs based on sister LTR identification in large contigs obtained assembling Illumina-sequenced BAC pools. By this approach, only putative full-length REs, that is, with two very similar LTRs, were scored. In total, we have isolated 254 full-length LTR-REs that can be added to the already available RE sequences.18The isolated full-length REs and their remnants represent 12.33% of the olive genome and constitute a particular fraction of these sequences. First, the sample of REs may have been biased by the assembly process. Repetitive elements represent the most difficult parts to assemble in any shotgun assembly project and are often under-represented in whole-genome assemblies. We assembled pools of 384 BACs that should on average each comprise 42,000 nt of genomic sequence, corresponding to <3% of the total genome size for olive. This should make the assembly of repetitive elements easier, even though difficulties may remain for high-copy sequences (that are represented in multiple copies within each pool) as well as for elements that have identical LTRs at their ends, where it may have been difficult to assemble a complete element with both LTRs. This may have affected not only the representation of different families and superfamilies, but also our estimation of insertion times of elements, because the REs with identical or nearly identical LTRs may not have been reconstructed as complete elements. Secondly, the method used to isolate full-length REs allowed us to select especially dispersed elements, whereas nested elements were probably under-represented in the sample, and it is known that nested REs constitute a large fraction of the repetitive component in medium- to large-sized genomes, such as those of maize38 or sunflower.16 It is possible that the REs isolated in this work are preferentially located in the gene-rich fraction of the olive genome, as suggested by the large number of protein-coding sequences that were found in the upstream or downstream region of REs. Nevertheless, the selected set of 254 full-length REs constitutes a valuable sample of these sequences, allowing an analysis of RE dynamics in this species.In angiosperms, Gypsy and Copia superfamilies are differently represented in the genome. Different ratios between Gypsy and Copia RE frequencies were reported,39 ranging from 5 : 1 in papaya40 to 1 : 2 in grapevine.41 Analysis of the whole olive genome showed a ratio of 1.17.18 The isolated olive full-length REs showed, on the contrary, a slight prevalence of Copia over Gypsy elements. This could be related to a different accumulation in genic and intergenic regions of the genome between Copia and Gypsy elements. In fact, Copia REs are often scattered on the chromosomes, whereas Gypsy elements preferentially accumulate—in a nested way—in specific chromosomal locations and structures, such as centromeric and pericentromeric regions.42 In this sense, the larger number of isolated Copia REs would be a consequence of the procedure used for RE identification. On the other hand, analysis of RE redundancy clearly showed that isolated full-length Gypsy elements, although at a lower number than Copia, account for a larger fraction of the genome, suggesting that they are more redundant, and confirming the previously reported results.18The occurrence of RE families in the olive genome was established according primarily to sequence similarity of their RT-coding sequences. Although, in many cases, bootstrap values were <50%, the trees suggest the occurrence of a number of RE clusters. It is to be noted that the most redundant elements (both Gypsy and Copia) are clustered, indicating that the corresponding families have been highly active during olive genome evolution.The relatively low frequency of REs in the olive genome could be related to a low rate of retrotransposition, but also to RE loss.43 RE DNA removal is driven in plants by a number of mechanisms, including DNA rearrangements and unequal homologous recombination; solo-LTRs are the main products of such processes.32,44,45Analysing the relative redundancy of LTRs and inter-LTR regions in the same full-length RE allowed us to evaluate the occurrence of solo-LTRs related (i.e. belonging to the same family) to that RE. Solo-LTRs related to the isolated full-length REs were rare: only 16 of 254 REs showed a ratio between the number of mapped reads per kb of LTR and inter-LTR >2.5. The LTR/inter-LTR ratios of Gypsy elements were generally higher than those of Copia. These ratios were especially high for one Copia and two Gypsy elements, sharing sequence similarity with chromodomain-containing and Ale REs of other species, indicating the occurrence of a large number of solo-LTRs for RE families that are related to these full-length elements. However, the presence of REs sharing LTRs but not internal regions cannot be ruled out and could lead to an overestimation of solo-LTR frequencies.If genome size derives from an equilibrium between enlargement (by polyploidization and RE amplification) and reduction (by DNA loss) in olive, the genome size was increased by massive amplification of REs and of tandem repeats.18 This increase was partly counterbalanced by DNA loss, related to both Gypsy and Copia elements, in contrast to other species in which solo-LTRs have been found especially in Copia elements, as, for example, in sunflower.46,47Concerning the amplification of REs, the identification of sister LTRs allowed us, for the first time, to date the insertion of REs in the olive genome, using the method established by SanMiguel et al.19 in maize. Obviously, the estimation of insertion time by the number of mutations in sister LTRs is subject to error, because it assumes that the same mutation rates operate in all retroelements and chromosome positions, while that was not proved to be true in, for example, the genus Oryza.48 However, this method appears as the most suitable to study RE dynamics.Analysis of sister LTR similarity indicates that, in olive, both Gypsy and Copia REs have been active in the same period. Nearly, all the identified full-length elements appear to be mobilized in a time-span of 40 MY (Fig. 4), although it is conceivable that more ancient REs are not easily recognizable because of accumulation of variability between sister LTRs.The mean insertion date of olive Copia full-length REs is lower than that of Gypsy. The insertion date profiles indicate that, during the last 40 MY, Copia and Gypsy REs have both been active, but with different time courses. For example, only one isolated Gypsy full-length RE inserted between 1 and 8 MY ago. Moreover, the percentage of Gypsy REs inserted between 10 and 25 MY ago, and hence, presumably, their retrotransposition activity is by far larger than that of Copia elements. Different amplification histories of these RE superfamilies during the evolution of the host species have been reported in many plant species. De facto analysis of crop genomes in a phylogenetic context reveals scarce congruence in RE content and highlights differences in the success of different RE types.39In contrast to other species, such as maize14 and sunflower,49,50 in which the RE burst is very recent and probably still occurring, in the olive genome the insertion of new REs appears to be decreasing in frequency in the last 8 MY, for both Gypsy and Copia REs. A similar time course of the RE amplification wave was reported in the genome of a gymnosperm, the Norway spruce.35 While our estimates of insertion ages may have been biased against the most recent elements by the assembly process as discussed previously, it is to be considered that all those REs interrupted by other elements (i.e. presumably older than inserted ones) are not included in the sample. The observation of a considerable number of elements inserted >10 MY ago is still valid and represents a clear distinctive feature of the olive genome in comparison with other angiosperm genomes analysed so far.The relationship between insertion time of an element and its redundancy offers further insights into olive RE dynamics. Gypsy and Copia full-length REs inserted between 10 and 30 MY ago are by far the most abundant, while recently inserted elements show low levels of redundancy. This is expected because it is known that lowly redundant elements are more prone to escape RE silencing. The age distribution of REs further suggests a progressive reduction in RE activity from 20 MY ago until now.Dating the amplification process of another major repeat class in the olive genome, the tandem repeats, could clarify if a type of ‘competition’ in the genome colonization has occurred between repeat types during olive evolution.Concerning olive RE transcription, no data are currently available. Ancient LTR-REs are generally inactive or less active than young ones, probably because of the accumulation of mutations determining premature stop codons in the coding portion of the LTR-RE, as observed in rice.51 Moreover, there is also a strong control of RE activity by the host species; it has been established that REs are especially silenced by siRNA.52 It is plausible that the large number of LTR-RE fragments spread throughout the olive genome can produce siRNAs that silence related retroelements.In conclusion, our analyses show many aspects of RE dynamics in the evolution of the olive genome. Some data are similar to those observed in other plant species, but some peculiarities of the olive genome also emerged for this repeat class, besides the extreme redundancy of tandem repeats. All these data support the theory that if RE dynamics are similar, including birth through transposition, silencing and then death by both random mutation and possibly deletion from the genome,53 the factors inducing such dynamics might be different in different RE lineages and possibly related to the ‘ecosystem’ in which the REs interact and compete.54 Hence, according to Venner et al.,55 olive REs can be considered a community of different organisms in the genome, with ‘species’ (corresponding to RE superfamilies) and ‘subspecies’, characterized by different LTR sequences, activity, and evolution history.5.

IntroductionCell-surface polysaccharides play an essential role in the ability of bacteria to survive and persist in the environment and in host organisms.1 The O-antigen polysaccharide constitutes the outermost part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The chemical composition and structure of the O-antigen exhibit high levels of variation even within a single species.2–5 This observation is corroborated by the huge serological variation of somatic O antigens. Currently, the O serogrouping, sometimes combined with H (flagellar) antigens and K (capsular polysaccharide) antigens, is a standard method for subtyping of Escherichia coli strains in taxonomical and epidemiological studies. In particular, identification of strains of the same O serogroup is a prerequisite to start any actions for outbreak investigations and surveillance.Thus far, the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Escherichia and Klebsiella based at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) in Denmark (http://www.ssi.dk/English.aspx) has recognized 184 E. coli O serogroups. It is generally believed that the O serogrouping of E. coli strains provides valuable information for identifying pathogenic clonal groups, especially for public health surveillance. For example, O157 is a leading O serogroup associated with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and is a significant food-borne pathogen worldwide.6,7 Other important EHEC O serogroups include O26, O103, and O111.8 The Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O104:H4 was found responsible for a large human food-borne disease outbreak in Europe, 2011.9 Another notable example is strains of serogroup O25; extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing, multidrug-resistant E. coli O25:H4 has emerged worldwide to cause a wide variety of community and nosocomial infections.10In E. coli, the genes required for O-antigen biosynthesis are clustered at a chromosomal locus flanked by the colanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster (wca genes) and the histidine biosynthesis (his) operon. Generally, the O-antigen biosynthesis genes fall into three classes: (i) the nucleotide sugar biosynthesis genes, (ii) the sugar transferase genes, and (iii) those for O-unit translocation and chain synthesis (wzx/wzy in the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway and wzm/wzt in the Wzm/Wzt-dependent ABC transporter pathway).11 To date, >90 types of O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster (O-AGC) sequences have been determined, with the majority derived from major human and animal pathogens.12 Sequence comparisons of these O-AGCs indicate a great variety of genetic structures. Several studies have provided evidence to show that horizontal transfer and replacement of a part or all of the O-AGC have caused shifts in O serogroups.13–15 Alternatively, point mutations in the glycosyltransferase genes in the O-AGC or acquisition of alternative O-antigen modification genes, which are located outside of the O-AGC, have also been shown to result in structural alterations of O antigen and concomitant change in the serotype of the isolate.16,17Genes or DNA sequences specific for each O serogroup can be used as targets for the identification of O serogroups via molecular approaches, such as PCR-based and hybridization-based methods. Such systems have already been developed by several researchers to target specific O-antigen types.12,18–20 In particular, molecular assays targeting major O serogroups are routinely used in EHEC surveillance for clinical or food sample screening. Considering the range of diseases caused by E. coli strains belonging to many different serogroups, a more comprehensive and detailed O-AGC information for the complete set of E. coli O serogroups is of significant clinical importance for generating a rational molecular typing scheme. This molecular typing scheme, which could be performed in silico directly on sequence data, also offers a mechanism with which to link the ever-expanding genomic data to our extensive epidemiological and biological knowledge of this pathogen, based on O-antigen typing. Moreover, these data will also provide a much better understanding of the complex mechanisms by which a huge diversity in O serogroups have arisen. Here, we present a complete sequence set for the O-AGCs from all 184 E. coli O serogroups, which include recently added serogroups (O182–O187), providing a complete picture of the O-AGC diversity in E. coli.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains, culture condition, and DNA preparationReference strains of all 184 recognized E. coli O serogroups were obtained from SSI (see Supplementary Table S1). Cells were grown to the stationary phase at 37°C in Luria–Bertani medium. Genomic DNA was purified using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.2. O-AGC sequences and comparative analysesOne hundred and eight E. coli O-AGC sequences were determined by Sanger-based capillary sequencing and/or Illumina MiSeq sequencing from PCR products covering O-AGCs (Supplementary Table S1). The O-AGC regions of the reference strains were amplified by PCR using 10 ng of genomic DNA as template with the Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.) by 25 amplification cycles for 10 s at 98°C and for 16 m at 69°C, and with a combination of three forward primers (TATGCCAGCGGCACCAAACG, ATACCGGCGATGAAAGCC, and GCGGGTGGGATTAAGTCTCT) designed on the hisFI genes and two reverse primers (GTGATGCAGGAATCCTCTGT and CCACGCTAATTACGCCATCTT) designed on the wcaM genes, or strain-specific primers designed based on the draft genome sequences determined using the MiSeq system from reference strains. Identification and functional annotation of the CDSs were performed based on the results of homology searches against the public, non-redundant protein database using BLASTP. The sequences reported in this article have been deposited in the GenBank database (accession no. AB811596-AB811624, AB812020-AB812085, and AB972413-AB972425). The other 76 E. coli O-AGC sequences were obtained from public databases. For a list of accession numbers, see Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Phylogenetic analysisMultilocus sequence typing (MLST) was carried out according to the protocol described on the E. coli MLST website (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli), and the phylogenetic relationships of reference strains were analysed based on the concatenated sequences (3,423 bp) of seven housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, and recA) used for MLST. Multiple alignments of DNA and amino acid sequences were constructed by using the CLUSTAL W program.21 Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the neighbour-joining algorithm using the MEGA4 softrware.223. Results3.1. Genetic structures of the O-AGCs from all E. coli O serogroupsOf the 184 known O serogroups, 76 complete O-AGC sequences were obtained from public databases. The sequence of the other 108 O-AGC was determined in this study from E. coli O-serogroup reference strains (Supplementary Table S1). Our analysis of these sequences confirmed several previously observed characteristics of O-AGCs in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. S1). In brief, O-AGCs are located between the wca and his operons. This region contains three housekeeping genes: galF (encoding UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase), gnd (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), and ugd (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase), and most genes for O-antigen biosynthesis in each cluster are directly flanked by galF and gnd/ugd, while gne (UDP-GalNAc-4-epimerase) and wzz (O-antigen chain length determination protein) located immediately outside of the region between galF and gnd/ugd (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The exceptions for this are the O-AGCs for O serogroups O14 and O57, which contain no O-antigen genes at the typical locus. However, it is known that the E. coli O14 reference strain Su4411-41 shows an O rough phenotype and lacks the O-AGC.23 For O57, a further analysis is also required to investigate the presence of O-antigen structure in the LPS of the reference strain. Our data revealed that the O-AGCs located between galF and gnd ranged in size from 4.5 kbp (O155, including four genes) to 19.5 kbp (O108, including 18 genes).Genes required for the deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-sugar biosynthesis pathway (rmlBDAC) to synthesize dTDP-l-rhamnose (dTDP-l-Rha), the precursor of l-Rha, were widely distributed in the O-AGCs (conserved in 56 O-serogroup O-AGCs; see Supplementary Fig. S1). The vioAB operon, for the biosynthesis of dTDP-N-acetylviosamine (dTDP-VioNAc), the precursor of VioNAc, was present in three O-serogroup O-AGCs; the fnlABC operon for the synthesis of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetyl-l-fucosamine (UDP-l-FucNAc), the precursor of l-FucNAc, was in 11 O-serogroup O-AGCs; the fnlA-qnlBC genes for the synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-l-quinovosamine (UDP-l-QuiNAc), the precursor of l-QuiNAc, were in four O-serogroup O-AGCs; the nnaDBCA genes for synthesis of cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminate (CMP–NeuNAc), the precursor of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid), were found in six O-serogroup O-AGCs (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, a gene set comprising seven genes putatively involved in the synthesis of di-N-acetyl-8-epilegionaminic acid (8eLeg5Ac7Ac) were found in three O-serogroup O-AGCs. For at least 49 O serogroups, gene sets for nucleotide sugar biosynthesis were not found in their O-AGCs (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that, in these serogroups, nucleotide sugars required for O-antigen biosynthesis were synthesized by pathways encoded by the genes located outside of the O-AGCs.Each O-AGC contained two to six genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases for synthesizing O-antigen subunits and a total of 611 glycosyltransferase genes identified in all O-AGCs. Pfam analysis revealed that at least 25 types of glycosyltransferase-related domains were found in the 611 glycosyltransferase genes (Supplementary Table S2). ‘Glycosyl transferases group 1’ (PF00534) and ‘Glycosyl transferase family 2’ (PF00535) were the most widely distributed domains, which were found in 216 and 253 genes, respectively. Except for the five genes belonging to ‘Glycosyltransferase family 52’ (PF07922), which were found in five of the six nnaDBCA-containing O-AGCs (O24, O56, O104, O131, and O171), there were no relationships between the type of glycosyltransferase-related domain and the gene set for sugar synthesis in each O-AGC.All O-AGCs carried either wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt gene pairs. Of the 182 O-AGCs (the above-mentioned O14 and O57 were excluded from the 184 clusters analysed in this study), 171 carried the wzx/wzy genes, and the other 11 carried the wzm/wzt genes (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). Detailed sequence comparisons of the wzx/wzy and wzm/wzt genes are described below.3.2. Grouping the O-AGCs by sequenceOn the basis of sequences and genetic structures of the entire O-AGC regions, in addition to 145 unique O-AGCs from different E. coli O serogroups, the O-AGCs from 37 O serogroups could be placed into 16 groups (named Gp1–Gp16) with the members of each group having identical or very similar O-AGC genes (mostly sharing =95% DNA sequence identity) (Fig. 1). This included nine groups with members of different serogroups but which carried identical O-AGC gene sets (Gp1–Gp9) and one group, Gp10, where two strains (O13 and O129) of the three-member group carried an identical O-AGC gene set (sharing 98.3–99.9% DNA sequence identity) (Fig. 1). The reason(s) why they belong to different O serogroups even though they have identical O-AGCs are discussed in the Discussion section. Indels or exchange of one or more genes was also shown to explain the differences between O135 and other members of Gp10 and members Gp11–Gp16, which otherwise carried highly conserved orthologous genes (summarized in Fig. 1). Simple insertions of insertion sequence (IS) elements containing one or two transposase genes were found in three groups without any gene disruption: an IS629 insertion in O18ab of Gp12, ISEc11 in O164 of Gp13, and IS1 in O62 of Gp14. IS element-associated replacement of the right-end portion of the O-AGC had occurred in three groups, Gp14, Gp15, and Gp16, resulting in the replacement (or deletion) of glycosyltransferase gene(s). Exchange of the wzx gene had also occurred in Gp16. These data suggest that IS elements are important drivers for generating O-antigen biosynthesis gene replacement and therefore diversity.

Diversity and specificity of the wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt genes among the E. coli O-AGCsAs previously proposed,12 most wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt orthologues showed high levels of sequence diversity and their sequences were unique to each O-AGC or O-AGC group described above (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). DNA sequence identities of the closest pairs were <70%, except for the O96/O170 pair, the wzx genes of which showed 86% DNA sequence identity. Within the 16 O-AGC groups, the orthologous wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt genes also showed high sequence conservation (=95% DNA sequence identity, but mostly =97% identity), except for Gp16 that shared only the wzy gene (Fig. 2).

Phylogenetic relationships of E. coli O-serogroup reference strainsBased on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of seven housekeeping genes used for MLST, we determined the evolutionary relationships of all E. coli O-serogroup reference strains (Fig. 3). This analysis revealed that the members of five groups sharing the common O-AGCs (Gp8, Gp10, Gp11, Gp14, and Gp15) and two members (O17 and O77) of Gp9 were found in closely related lineages. However, the members of other groups (and three members of Gp9) were found in distinct evolutionary lineages. For example, O20 and O137, both carrying the Gp1 O-AGC, were found in two distinct lineages, each belonging to phylogroups A and E/D, respectively, and five serogroups (O17/O77, O44, O73, and O106) belonging to Gp9 were found in multiple lineages (A, E/D, and B1). Correlation between the Escherichia coli evolutionary lineages and the distribution of O-AGCs. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping genes from all 184 E. coli O-serogroup reference strains. The group names of O-AGCs (Gp1–Gp16) are indicated in the outermost region. Members in groups indicated in green were found to belong to the same or very closely related lineage, whereas members of the groups indicated in blue were found in distinct lineages. The outer circle next to the O serogroup names indicates the distribution of sugar synthesis gene sets identified in each O-AGC. The inner circle indicates the type of O-antigen processing system (wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt). Phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, D, and E) were determined by comparing the sequences of the strains tested with the known sequences from the ECOR collection (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli).Correlation between the Escherichia coli evolutionary lineages and the distribution of O-AGCs.

Additionally, three clonal groups containing five or more reference strains were also identified in phylogroups A (ST34 and ST57) and B1 (ST300) (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic analysis also showed that the types of sugar synthesis gene sets and processing gene sets (wzx/wzy and wzm/wzt) were not limited to a specific lineage (Fig. 3).3.5. Relationships of the E. coli and Shigella O-AGCsShigella and E. coli belong to the same species complex24 and many Shigella O antigens are known to be serologically and genetically identical or very similar to some E. coli O antigens, as summarized by Liu et al.25 In addition to the 21 previously shown relationships, we found two additional O-AGC groups shared by E. coli and Shigella; O38 and Shigella dysenteria type 8 (SD8), and O169/O183 and Shigella boydii type 6/10 (SB6/SB10) (Supplementary Fig. S4). The O183-AGC was highly similar to the S. boydii types 10 cluster (sharing 98.2% DNA sequence identity). In our previous study,26 we provisionally named a novel O serogroup for a group of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains as OSB10, which cross-reacted with S. boydii type 10. Sequence comparisons in this study revealed that OSB10 is not only serologically but also genetically identical to the new serogroup O183 of Gp16.4. DiscussionMuch of what we know about E. coli is defined at some level by O serogroups. To link genomic information to the wealth of data held in public databases, in our collective knowledge, outbreak, and disease reports and elsewhere, we endeavoured to determine whether molecular O-serogroup identification, targeting O-serogroup-specific genes (or unique sequences), was a valuable method to capture this information and maintain this important link. Not only do we show evidence supporting the effectiveness of molecular O-typing, but also we open up the possibility of generating a molecular O-typing scheme and relate O serogroups to the underlying phylogeny of this bacterium.By determining and comparing the sequences of O-AGCs from all known E. coli O serogroups, we newly defined the sequence and gene content of 145 unique O-AGCs and showed that O-AGCs from 37 O serogroups could be placed into 16 groups based on members in each group sharing nearly identical or highly similar O-AGCs. It is clear from these data that many of the grouped O-AGCs (Gp1-16) were found in distinct phylogenetic lineages indicating that these O-AGCs have been spread across this species by horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, several lineages that contained multiple O serogroups, ST10, ST34, ST57, and ST300, show that frequent exchange occurs between and within lineages. ST10 and its close relatives are particularly interesting as one-quarter of E. coli O-serogroup reference strains fell within this clonal group. ST10 and its clonal complex are clinically very important being recently found to include ESBL-producing E. coli from human and animals in Spain,25 Italy and Denmark,26 China,27 and the Netherlands,28 and in various intra-intestinal pathotypes of E. coli, such as enteroaggregative E. coli,27,28 enterotoxigenic E. coli,29,30 and EHEC.31,32 In most cases, the O serogroups of these ST10 or ST10-related strains are unusual compared with the typical O serogroups that represent that pathotype.Acquisition of O-antigen modification genes located on the genomes of serotype-converting bacteriophages or plasmids is also an important strategy for diversifying O-antigen structures. This mechanism has been well investigated in Shigella flexneri.33,34 In E. coli, the O-serogroup conversion by a prophage-like element has been reported for O17 and O44,17 which belong to Gp9 defined in this study. Another possible mechanism to generate the variation of O antigens is the mutations in the genes of the O-AGC as observed for O107 and O117,16 which belong to Gp8. In this case, point mutations in a glycosyltransferase gene are responsible for the alteration of O-antigen structure (and thus that of O serogroup).16 Five O-AGC groups including Gp2, Gp5, Gp7, Gp12, and Gp13 also contained differences in the amino acid sequence of their glycosyltransferases. O serogroup differences in these groups may be generated by the point mutations in glycosyltransferase genes. On the other hand, all glycosyltransferase genes in Gp1, Gp3, Gp4, Gp6, and Gp11; four strains from Gp9 (O17, O44, O73, and O77) and two from Gp10 (O13 and O129) showed 100% amino acid sequence identity. These results suggest that the serological differences between the members of these seven groups have been generated by acquisition of modification genes outside of the O-AGC as shown for O17 and O44 of Gp9.17We believe that the remarkable sequence diversity observed in the wzx/wzy and wzm/wzt O-AGC genes of all known E. coli O serogroups appears to be sufficiently discriminative from one another to make identification of each of the known O serogroups possible. Therefore, our sequence data will serve as a valuable resource for the development of rationally designed molecular methods for O-typing as well as for detecting novel O serogroups.In conclusion, our study provides a complete sequence set of O-AGCs of all known E. coli O serogroups and thus offers a full view on the genetic diversity of O-AGCs of this bacterium. In addition, the results presented suggest that horizontal gene transfer has been involved in the O serogroup diversification in E. coli more frequently and in a more biased or lineage-dependent fashion than previously thought.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Health Labor Sciences Research Grants from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Japan to A.I.

IntroductionData mining of extensive genome-scale databases, such as the Human Epigenome Atlas,1 ENCODE,2 Eukaryotic Promoter Database,3 DBTSS,4 database on CpG islands,5 FANTOM5,6 and many others, cannot be performed without efficient bioinformatic tools. Typically, the researcher is interested in finding correlations between various characteristics distributed over the genome (commonly termed genome tracks). The trends in the close or remote positioning between genomic features may indicate their coordinated action in chromatin packing, recombination, replication, or transcription.7 The features on the genome can be presented as points [e.g. transcription start sites (TSS), DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), contacts between chromosomes], stretches (transposons, exons and introns, CpG islands), or profiles defined throughout the sites (expression profiles, protein-binding profiles). The stretches can be described in terms of their lengths and positions of some characteristic points (starts/centres/ends). The effects related to these two parameters (overlapping and positioning of stretches) should be studied separately. A part of correlational analysis related to the mutual positioning of starts/centres/ends of stretches can also be reduced to the study of point distributions. The processing of profiles is rather complicated. The processing of data from several experiments and data on the background noise results in identifying the maxima in profiles or the significant regions distributed over the genome. Such maxima and regions can further be treated as points and stretches. Therefore, the general assessment of correlations between features of two types always includes an estimation of the closeness between two point sets.Despite the seemingly simple formulation, such analysis remains a challenge.8–10 The distribution of distances between consecutive genome track elements proved to be significantly different from that in the reference random model, with the variations in lengths between consecutive genomic elements being much stronger than the approximately homogeneous distribution of randomly positioned elements (see Results). In this sense, the distribution of genome track elements may be called inhomogeneous. The strong inhomogeneity in the distribution of genomic features over the genome, which is inherent to most genetic data, hampers statistical analysis. The application of simple and standardized methods, such as correlation functions, needs the coarse graining of data over 10–100 kb bins11 and smears the resolution of correlations. The proper approach should be based on the relevant statistical criteria. The developed analytical criteria and respective packages ought to be robust against the spatial inhomogeneity of feature distribution.Among the available packages, the Genomic HyperBrowser12,13 is based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the assessment of the statistical significance of correlations between genome tracks of two types, whereas GenometriCorr14 uses the combination of statistically grounded analytical criteria with a permutation test. The application of simulations generally needs at least two rounds of simulations with an enhanced number of realizations to prove the statistical convergence of a method and is rather time consuming. The simulations are difficult to implement for the study of large genome-scale data sets. In contrast to packages based on the simulations, packages based on the analytical criteria (i.e. on the mathematical expressions derived in advance) do not need a large number of trial realizations for assessment of statistical significance and, therefore, save a lot of computational time.Primarily, we were interested in the applications of available packages to the particular correlations between DSBs and epigenetic features. We began by testing available packages. In a random independent set of points, the position of each point does not depend on the positions of other random points or on the positions of points of any other (random or not) set. Thus, if at least one of two sets is random and independent, correlations between the two sets should be absent. Testing of both packages, Genomic HyperBrowser and GenometriCorr, for the absence of correlations between a random independent set and a strongly inhomogeneous, non-random genomic set revealed that the packages may indicate artificial correlations in this case. Moreover, as both packages do not suggest a measure for assessment of intrinsic inhomogeneity, the attribution between a random set and a non-random inhomogeneous set is not known a priori. If the true attribution was permuted, the correct assessment of correlations actually failed in both packages. The failure is perhaps related to problems in statistical assessment. Note that our remarks are concerned only with the particular options in the Genomic HyperBrowser and GenometriCorr corresponding to the study of correlations between two point sets. Therefore, we were prompted to develop an original statistical algorithm and package, the Genome Track Analyzer, based on this algorithm. Our package is freely available at http://ancorr.eimb.ru/. The usage of the analytical criteria permits the rapid processing of large-scale data. We tried to formulate our resulting analytical criteria in terms of Gaussian z-statistics that is familiar to most researchers.The testing of available packages and the study of particular examples proved that the assessment of genome track inhomogeneity and the robustness of the algorithm against inhomogeneity are crucial for the correct analysis of correlations between genome tracks. In this article, we present the quantitative measure for inhomogeneity of genome tracks, robust statistical criteria, and an algorithm for the analysis of correlations between two genome tracks, and we compare the different packages. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our package to the study of particular correlations between different genetic and epigenetic features related to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Among our particular applications, the correlations between CpG islands and TSS are well studied and serve in our work mainly as an additional test, whereas the correlations between TSS on the forward and reverse strands in eukaryotic genomes, as well as the correlations between DSBs and H3K4me3 marks in the Homo sapiens genome, can be considered as original. The correlations between protein-binding profiles for Drosophila melanogaster were likely not studied using the similar statistical methods. They reflect the mutual dependence between features that was established experimentally. The correlations between particular genomic tracks obtained with the Genomic HyperBrowser and GenometriCorr were compared with that obtained using our package.2. Materials and methodsIn this section, we describe the basic theory and the main algorithm. The genome tracks proved to be often inhomogeneous and strongly different from quasi-homogeneous random distributions. We present the quantitative criteria for assessment of genome track inhomogeneity. The algorithm developed in this article is robust against inhomogeneity effects. It is implied that, after preprocessing (Preprocessing of input genetic data), the genetic data will correspond to the set of points that divides the genome (or a genome region) under study into a set of fragments.2.1. Reference model2.2. Assessment of genome track inhomogeneity2.3. Ordering of genomic features2.4. Preprocessing of input genetic dataIf the input genetic data correspond to the particular sites, e.g. sites of DSBs, TSS, etc., they are commonly used without additional preprocessing. If needed, preliminary clustering of points can be performed.The stretches, such as CpG islands, transposons, etc., are replaced by points in the starts/centres/ends of the stretches. The overlapping of stretches is permissible. The mean distance between consecutive reference points should be much longer than the characteristic length of stretches.2.5. AlgorithmThe analysis shows that most genetic data are strongly inhomogeneous, i.e. the variations in lengths corresponding to genome tracks are stronger than that corresponding to the random division of the genome in the same number of fragments (Assessment of genome track inhomogeneity). Therefore, the criteria and algorithm for assessment of mutual correlations between two genome tracks should be robust against inhomogeneity of corresponding length distributions. The algorithm presented below satisfies this requirement.The subsequences (A)k or (B)k (k = 3) are discarded, because they cannot be associated with the neighbouring points of the other type. The subsequences AABB or BBAA are also discarded.This leaves us only two fundamental types of subsequences: ABA and BAB. All other possible sequences under consideration are their combinations. Our algorithm processes the entire sequence of points, splitting it into fundamental subsequences ABA and BAB from left to right. In the process of splitting, consequent fundamental subsequences can have only one common border letter, and they cannot overlap by two or more letters. For example, ABABA is split into ABA and ABA.In the subsequence BAB, the pair of the nearest neighbours is determined relative to the A point and corresponds to the minimum of two lengths in the combinations BA and AB, whereas in the subsequence ABA the pair of the nearest neighbours is determined relative to the B point and corresponds to the minimum of two lengths in the combinations AB and BA.3. Results3.1. Tests and comparison of different packagesThe distribution of genome tracks over the genome is often strongly inhomogeneous. As a typical example, we chose the exons on the forward and reverse strands of 23 human chromosomes (the Y-chromosome was discarded due to insufficient data). Both the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and entropy criteria revealed strong inhomogeneity of this set (Supplementary data S1). The positions of points in any random set are independent of that of exons and should be uncorrelated with them. This test was used to verify the predictions in different packages. For a particular MC realization, the P-value characterizing the significance of correlations between exons and a random set was calculated for each chromosome separately. The correlations were assumed to be significant if P < 0.05. Then, we calculated the observed fraction of events with predicted P < 0.05 per 100 MC realizations (false discovery rate, FDR). As neither Genomic HyperBrowser12,13 nor GeometriCorr14 suggests the criteria for the comparison of the inhomogeneity of two sets, we performed the blind computations in which the attribution of two sets was unknown.Statistical analysis of correlations between genome tracks with Genomic HyperBrowser was performed to test the hypothesis: point–point located nearby? The correlations in this package were assessed via MC simulations, in which one of the sets was preserved, whereas the other was replaced by MC samples. The maximal number of MC samples was 1,000. To create single-line commands suitable for batch processing, we used Perl scripts written by ourselves. GenometriCorr used the combination of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for the normalized lengths together with a permutation test for distances between the points of two sets. In GenometriCorr, the user should manually set the extreme 5'- and 3'-ends of the data range to define the limits of the chromosome region under study for correct correlations. This option is called ‘mapping’ and is turned off by default. For setting mapping, we used an R script written by ourselves. The number of permutations for the assessment of absolute distance P-value was 1,000. For our package, we used the united Gaussian criterion (23) with attribution of sets by the entropy z criterion (10). The results are compared in Table 1. FDR for the tests on the absence of correlations between exons in human chromosomes and random setsAll tests were performed with predicted P-values <0.05. The expected mean value and standard deviation for FDR per 100 MC realizations should be 0.05 ± 0.005.FDR, false discovery rate; MC, Monte Carlo; KS, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.FDR for the tests on the absence of correlations between exons in human chromosomes and random setsAll tests were performed with predicted P-values <0.05. The expected mean value and standard deviation for FDR per 100 MC realizations should be 0.05 ± 0.005.FDR, false discovery rate; MC, Monte Carlo; KS, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.The results in Table 1 reveal strong dependence of the FDR on the attribution of sets. If exon positions are preserved, while the random set is MC randomized, the Genomic HyperBrowser provides the FDR about five times higher than the expected rate. GenometriCorr provides the correct rate for the relative distance KS P-value and the correspondence exons—reference, random—query, whereas the usage of the absolute distance P-value provides the FDR ~2-fold higher than the expected rate at the same correspondence. The permutation in set attribution (i.e. the random set is preserved, while exon positions are MC randomized for the Genomic HyperBrowser and random—reference, exons—query for GenometriCorr) leads to the complete failure of the correlation prediction in both packages. This proves that the preliminary assessment of randomness/inhomogeneity is crucial for the correct statistical predictions.The computation time needed for one random realization in Genomic HyperBrowser was 1 h 35 min, in GenometriCorr 52 min, and in Genome Track Analyzer 9 s. This time included the duration of loading and processing of input data, direct computations, and processing of output data. In particular, for our package, the time needed for the loading and processing of input data was 8 s, and the processing of output data needed 1 s, whereas the direct computations took only 0.01 s.3.2. Correlations between CpG islands and TSSThe software package was applied to the analysis of particular genetic problems. The first one concerned the correlations between CpG islands and transcription start sites.5,22–24 The positions and overlapping of CpG islands with TSS affect gene expression in eukaryotes. The data on CpG islands on human chromosomes were taken from URL http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/CGI/,5 whereas the data on TSS were taken from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (http://epd.vital-it.ch/H. Sapiens hg19 version EPDnew 003).3 Our method supported the strong correlations between CpG islands and TSS with clear preceding ordering between 5'-ends of CpG islands and TSS. The study also showed overlap between CpG island and the nearest TSS (Supplementary data S2).3.3. Correlations between TSS on the forward and reverse strandsAdditionally, we found significant correlations between TSS on the forward and reverse strands of D. melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, H. sapiens, and Danio rerio (zebrafish) genomes. The positions of TSS on the reverse strand were projected to the forward strand. The detailed results are presented for D. melanogaster and H. sapiens. In Table 2, we included only the chromosomes in which the number of nearest neighbours exceeded 50 to ensure the applicability of Gaussian statistics. These data show clear positional and ordering correlations for the significant fraction of the TSS on two strands. Implying that expression regulation factors are upstream of TSS, the bias in projected TSS on the reverse strand preceding neighbouring TSS on the forward strand indicates that some regulatory elements such as CpG islands, enhancers, silencers, etc., may be common. Such a mode of regulation expression has, in fact, been experimentally established.25–27 The statistical significance of these correlations versus the counterpart random model proves the positive selection of such a mode of expression regulation during evolution. The fraction of the nearest neighbours for TSS turned out to be less than the theoretical prediction for the random sets with the same fractions of points [Equation (26)] for the H. sapiens genome and rather close to the theoretical prediction for the D. melanogaster genome (Table 2). The histograms for the relative and absolute lengths between neighbouring TSS, scattering plot, and the list of the top nearest TSS on the reverse and forward strands are summarized in Supplementary data S3. The histograms for both H. sapiens and D. melanogaster genomes show the length distributions peaked at the small distances between neighboring TSS in accordance with significant positional correlations. The histograms for the absolute lengths revealed a sharp drop at the distances exceeding the characteristic nucleosome length of ~200 bp. Though the absolute and relative lengths between neighbouring TSS were significantly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficients exceeded 0.7, P < 0.001), only the criteria formulated in terms of relative lengths proved to be robust against the inhomogeneity of genome tracks. The distribution of the nearest neighbouring TSS on the forward and reverse strands across particular chromosomes of the H. sapiens genome is shown in Fig. 1a, which was drawn with the Integrated Genome Browser.28 The distributions of the TSS pairs across all chromosomes of the H. sapiens genome listed in Table 2 can be found in Supplementary data S4. Correlations between transcription start sites on the forward and reverse strandsThe positions of TSS on the reverse strand were projected to the forward strand. z and zP are calculated by Equations (23) and (11) and characterize the positional and ordering correlations between TSS, respectively. The 1% significance thresholds for |z| and |zP| in the case of random correlations correspond to 2.58, while 5% significance thresholds correspond to 1.96. The positive values of zP indicate that projected TSS on the reverse strand precede TSS on the forward strand. The corresponding P-values were calculated using Gaussian statistics. The data were filtered by the number of pairs of the nearest neighbours (NN) exceeding 50 to ensure the applicability of Gaussian statistics.Correlations between transcription start sites on the forward and reverse strandsThe positions of TSS on the reverse strand were projected to the forward strand. z and zP are calculated by Equations (23) and (11) and characterize the positional and ordering correlations between TSS, respectively.

The data on binding sites for TF associated with genes were taken from http://www.genecards.org.The analysis of some nearest TSS duplets revealed that they correspond to rather short intergenic regions between pairs of closely located genes that reside on different strands. They may have mutual enhancers or bidirectional promoters, and thus should correspond to genes with coordinated expression. The particular examples are shown in Fig. 1b. Currently, we are analysing these gene pairs to determine the role of this type of genome organization for coordinated regulation of genes in the human genome.3.4. Correlations between protein-binding profilesThe second problem concerned the relationships between profiles characterizing DNA binding with proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and H3me3K27 marks in the chromosomes of D. melanogaster. E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc belong to the polycomb group (PcG) of proteins, which are important for maintaining the transcriptional repression of homeotic genes.29–32 The corresponding processed and aggregated profiles were obtained by Schwartz et al.29 and were taken from EMBL ArrayExpress accession E-MEXP-535.33 The profiles were preliminarily filtered by the cut-off threshold mean + 2 SD and clustered with a distance in the range 50–500 nt with steps of 50 nt (Preprocessing of input genetic data). The data before and after preprocessing with a clustering distance of 50 nt are shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding z-ratios [Equation (23)] indicate strong correlations between binding profiles for the PcG proteins and for H3me3K27 marks (Fig. 2b). The correlations strongly depend on the clustering distance (Fig. 2c and Supplementary data S5). As the characteristic binding region for the PcG proteins is ~50 nt,34 the clustering distance of 50 nt may be considered as optimal in this example. The cut-off threshold affects the number of nearest neighbours, but it retains the mode of correlations at a given clustering distance. These observations are in accordance with the data on the coordinate action of the E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc proteins, and the H3me3K27 marks in the silencing mechanisms for D. melanogaster.29,30(a) The binding profiles for proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and for H3me3K27 histone marks over chromosome 3R of Drosophila melanogaster.

The input data after preprocessing are shown below initial profiles. (b) z-ratios [Equation (23)] characterizing pairwise positional correlations between profiles for proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and for the H3me3K27 mark in the different chromosomes of D. melanogaster.

The positive values of zcorr reflect a trend towards shorter distances between profiles relative to the reference model (or correlations), whereas the negative values of zcorr reflect a trend towards longer distances between profiles (or anticorrelations).(a) The binding profiles for proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and for H3me3K27 histone marks over chromosome 3R of Drosophila melanogaster.

The positive values of zcorr reflect a trend towards shorter distances between profiles relative to the reference model (or correlations), whereas the negative values of zcorr reflect a trend towards longer distances between profiles (or anticorrelations).3.5. Correlations between DSBs and histone marksFinally, we studied the relationships between DSBs and histone mark H3K4me3 in human chromosomes. DSBs induced by physical, chemical, or genetic agents provide important information about the large-scale organization of chromatin and may potentially be related to genomic stability, including translocations, deletions, or amplifications.35–37 H3K4me3 is a well-known, promoter-specific histone modification that is associated with transcription and active genes. Recently, it was demonstrated that this epigenetic mark selectively directs global TFIID recruitment to active genes, some of which are p53 targets.38 The data on nucleotide-resolved DSBs were submitted to GEO with accession number GSE53811. DSBs were preliminarily preprocessed: DSBs mapped below 5% and above 95% of coverage were cut-off; the remaining DSBs were clustered within a distance of 1 kb (Preprocessing of input genetic data). Such a clustering distance provides the distribution of lengths between consecutive DSBs, which is similar to that observed in gel electrophoresis.35,36 The profiles for histone marks were taken from ENCODE accession wgEncodeEH000953 in the pre-aligned format BAM and were then processed with MACS2.21 The MACS2 peak-caller was used with the option ‘callpeak’ for identifying significant regions (treated like stretches in our package). Then, the correlations of corresponding midpoints of stretches with DSBs were studied with our package. The summary of correlations is shown in Fig. 3 and reveals clear positional correlations between these features. Such correlations support the hypothesis regarding the relationships between DSBs and coordinated gene expression.35,36(a) The distributions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and H3K4me3 histone marks over human chromosome 7. The distributions of DSBs and histone marks were coarse-grained over bins of 100 kb, i.e. the heights in these distributions correspond to the number of points in the bins of 100 kb. Both sets were preprocessed as described in the main text. The distribution of cytobands across chromosome 7 is shown above the length scale. (b) z-ratios [Equation (23)] characterizing pairwise positional correlations between distributions of DSBs and H3K4me3 in the human chromosomes. The correlations for the Y-chromosome are not shown due to poor statistics. The numbers below the chromosome nomenclature correspond to that of the nearest neighbours. The horizontal broken lines for z-ratios correspond to 5% (z = 1.96) and 1% (z = 2.58) significance thresholds for random correlations.(a) The distributions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and H3K4me3 histone marks over human chromosome 7.

The comparison showed that the detected correlations appeared to be significant in all three packages (with minor divergence depending on the package and method). The significance of correlations in all packages indicates that they are real, non-artificial correlations. Generally, the coincidence of the correlation significance obtained with the different packages may depend on the particular chosen example (see Tests and comparison of different packages).4. DiscussionOur study proves that the proper treatment of inhomogeneity inherent to genome tracks is essential for the correct assessment of correlations between genome tracks. We tried a series of algorithms, including our variants and those suggested by others,12–14 and found that none of the algorithms that used absolute length scales satisfied the test for the absence of correlations between a random independent set and a strongly inhomogeneous non-random set (Tests and comparison of different packages and Table 1). The choice of the relative lengths with local normalization turned out to be crucial for the absence of correlations between a strongly inhomogeneous set and a random one. The significant inhomogeneity inherent to genome tracks and strong variations in characteristic lengths may be related to the large-scale chromatin organization (see Ref. 17 for discussion and further references).All z-criteria (10), (11), and (23) used in our package are based on the central limit theorem. The variations in the vicinity |z| = 2.7 proved to be approximately Gaussian for the random sets. The application of Gaussian criteria implies that the number of pairs of nearest neighbours, K, should be sufficiently large. The convergence can be assessed by the parameter 1/K<U+2060>. We determined that 50–100 representatives or more are sufficient for Gaussian approximation in the corresponding z-criteria. For the small sets, the statistical scattering becomes large and the deviations from Gaussian statistics may be significant. As the tails of distributions for z-ratios are non-Gaussian, we used the coarse-grained scale for the presentation of significance for output z-values: |z| < 1.8, insignificant; 1.8< |z| <1.96, fuzzy; 1.96< |z| <2.58, significant; and |z| > 2.58, highly significant. In the visual presentation of the software, all grades are marked by different colours.Our analytical criteria proved to be robust against the inhomogeneous distribution of lengths corresponding to genome tracks, which is typical of genetic problems. The analytical criteria significantly shorten the time of computational analysis and permit the study of larger data sets in comparison with MC simulations (Tests and comparison of different packages). Note that the analysis of large output data arrays needs the application of extreme value statistics for the assessment of their statistical significance. For example, in the case of random correlations, ~5% of output z-values can exceed the threshold |z| >1.96. Generally, the distribution of the large output array of z-values can be compared with Gaussian distribution by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion.A similar approach can be applied to the study of distributions of nucleotide content or DNA physico-chemical characteristics over the genome. In the latter case, these parameters should, initially, be coarse-grained over a window of length W. The distribution of parameters over consecutive non-overlapping windows can further be treated in line with profile preprocessing (Preprocessing of input genetic data). If needed, the continuous criteria used in our package can be replaced by their corresponding discrete counterparts.17 In the next step, we will include the more detailed analysis of correlations between stretches that are characterized by both the positions of the stretch centres and the overlap of stretches. To conclude, the Genome Track Analyzer provides an efficient tool for the study of correlations between genome features with useful applications to many genetic problems. The study of correlations between genome tracks may shed light on the intricate regulation networks in the different organisms.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Russian Fund of Basic Research (grant number 14-04-01638) and a grant from the Molecular and Cellular Biology Program of the Russian Academy of Sciences.The authors are grateful to A.

IntroductionNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the characterization and comparison of whole genomes for a growing list of plant species.1–5 This same technology is being used to speed up and facilitate the breeding of crop plants.3,6–8 NGS also has the potential to enable new approaches to domesticate crops.9 One species targeted for domestication is Thlaspi arvense (field pennycress, pennycress herein). Pennycress is a member of the Brassicaceae in the tribe Thlaspideae native to Eastern Europe.10,11 Pennycress plants are diploid, propagate largely via self-fertilization, and have a 1C DNA content of 539 Mb.12 Naturalized populations are distributed worldwide, including North America, South America, and Australia.10,11 Previous molecular studies showed that the original Thlaspi genus was polyphylogenic, and several members of the Thlaspi genus were kept in a monophylogenic Thlaspideae tribe.13Thlaspi caerulescens, which is a well-studied heavy metal accumulator,14,15 was moved to the genus Noccaea during this reorganization.13,16 Two members of the original Thlaspi genus, Thlaspi ceratocarpum and Thlaspi alliaceum (roadside pennycress), are in the Thlaspideae along with Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and Peltaria alliacea (garlic cress) and several other species. The Brassicaceae are divided into three lineages, and the members of the Thlaspideae are in lineage II, which includes the Brassica genus, but not Arabidopsis (lineage I).17 Similar to Brassica napus and Brassica rapa, pennycress produces seeds with high oil content (30% by weight).18Field pennycress is being developed as a new winter cover crop and biodiesel feedstock for the Midwestern United States that can be seeded into standing corn.9,19–21 As a winter annual, pennycress germinates in the fall and overwinters as a vegetative rosette. It exhibits extreme winter hardiness, surviving the harsh winters that are common to the Canadian Plains and Midwestern United States.10 Pennycress flowers and matures early in the spring, producing up to 1,300 kg/hectare of seed that can be harvested in time for planting an additional summer annual crop of soybeans.9,22 The oils found in pennycress seed are suitable for biodiesel production,21 and the remaining seed meal is high in protein that could serve as an additional revenue source for farmers.11 As a winter cover, pennycress would provide important ecosystem services. In much of the Midwest, the ground lies barren from late fall until early summer, which can increase nutrient runoff and soil erosion.23 The addition of a fall-planted pennycress cover crop should reduce nutrient leaching and erosion, which would help sustain current farming practices. In the United States alone, over 16 million hectares currently used in the corn to soybean rotation could be used for pennycress production without displacing current food production systems.20,24As a weedy species, there are many challenges that will need to be addressed in order to convert pennycress into a new crop species.9 Pennycress already has many natural attributes such as the high seed yield and oil content described above. However, earlier maturing varieties are needed to ensure that pennycress can be harvested early, allowing for full-season soybean production. Seed dormancy also is an issue,25,26 as is common in many weed species; we have observed highly variable germination rates in preliminary field trials. Pennycress oil and protein meal are not currently suitable for animal or human consumption.27 Making pennycress seeds edible would add value to the crop. In addition, the fatty acids contained in the oil are adequate for conversion to biodiesel, but can be further optimized.18,21 It is unclear whether traditional breeding programmes can address these concerns, as there may be insufficient natural variation in wild populations.Arabidopsis thaliana has been used as a key organism to address questions concerning plant development for the past 30 yrs.28 Arabidopsis research has resulted in an understanding of many plant developmental processes, such as the control of time to flower, of seed maturation, and of seed oil synthesis.29–31 During the course of these studies, many mutations have been identified in Arabidopsis that confer what can be considered agronomically desirable phenotypes.9 The function of pennycress genes can be predicted on the basis of their similarity to genes with known function in Arabidopsis.9 With this information, it should be possible to identify mutations that confer desirable traits in pennycress using mutation-based breeding tools such as TILLING,32 DeTILLING,33 and CRISPR-Cas.34 To enable the use of these technologies and to take advantage of the information derived from research on Arabidopsis and other Brassica species, a genomic sequence is needed for pennycress.To generate a draft genome for pennycress, a natural population of plants was isolated from a roadside near Coates, Minnesota called MN106. Little is known about natural pennycress populations at the genome sequence level. In this report, we have examined this population at the genome level using several different NGS strategies to de novo assemble a draft genome. This assembly captures the vast majority of pennycress gene space as predicted by comparison with other Brassica species. The draft genome detailing the pennycress gene space has allowed the function of pennycress genes to be predicted on the basis of their similarity to genes with known function in Arabidopsis. In addition, the analysis revealed that even in mixed natural populations, the selfing mode of reproduction maintains individual plants in a highly homozygous state.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThlaspi arvense line MN106 has been previously described and originates from Coates, MN.19 Seed from a MN106 bulk planting was germinated on moist Berger BM2 germination mix (Berger Inc., www.berger.ca), stratified at 4°C for 7 days, and grown in climate-controlled growth chambers at the University of Minnesota (21°C, 16 h/8 h day/night cycles at 100 µmol/m2/s PAR). Individual plants were transplanted to 4-inch pots 2 weeks after germination. Six-week-old plants with established rosettes were vernalized at 4°C for 30 days in the dark. After vernalization, plants were returned to growth chambers. In all, nine plants were selected for DNA extraction. After tissue harvest, the same nine plants were maintained, and seeds were individually collected from each plant.2.2. Genomic DNA isolation and DNA sequencingTo enrich the total amount of nuclear DNA sequenced, nuclei were purified from young leaf tissue using a series of density gradient centrifugation steps using an adapted protocol.35 The full protocol for genomic DNA isolation is listed in the Supplementary Methods. Illumina sequencing (100 bp paired-end library run on Illumina HiSeq 2000, 250 bp paired-end library run on Illumina MiSeq, 50 bp long-jump mate pair libraries run on Illumina HiSeq 2000) was completed at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio RSII) sequencing was completed at the Mayo Clinic Molecular Biology Core (Rochester, MN). All raw sequencing files have been submitted to NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRP033211. FASTQ files from all sequencing runs were imported and subjected to quality control using the Sequencing QC Report tool in CLC Genomics Workbench Version 6.5 (CLC Bio, www.clcbio.com). Details on DNA sequencing library preparation and quality control parameters are described in the Supplementary Methods.2.3. Genome assembly, scaffolding, and annotationThe pennycress draft genome was assembled and annotated using two desktop computers built specifically for this purpose. The components and specifications of these computers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Genome sequencing reads were trimmed and de novo assembled in CLC Genomics Workbench Version 6.5 (CLC Bio, www.clcbio.com). The CLC assembler has previously been used in assembling complex plant genomes, such as the barley (Hordeum vulgare)36 and rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)37 genome projects. Additionally, the CLC assembler has a low Random Access Memory (RAM) requirement, opposed to other popular de Bruijn graph assemblers that can require hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. Initial assembled scaffolds over 1000 bp from the CLC assembly were scaffolded using SSPACE,38 and remaining gaps were filled using GAPFILLER.39 The genome assembly was annotated using the MAKER pipeline.40 A full description of assembly and annotation parameters is available in Supplementary Methods.2.4. Comparative genomicsComparative studies on the structural arrangement and synteny of the pennycress genome assembly were performed using SynMap (www.genomeevolution.org/CoGe/). To examine the synteny between the Eutrema salsugineum and Thlaspi arvense genomes, seven pseudochromosome sequences were constructed by concatenating the corresponding genomic scaffolds.1Thlaspi arvense genomic scaffolds >75 kb in length were compared with the seven E. salsugineum pseudochromosomes using a Syntenic Path Assembly in SynMap (DAGChainer – Relative Gene order, -D = 20, -A = 5, skip random/unknown chromosomes). BLASTp comparisons of the 27,390 predicted pennycress peptides were performed in CLC Genomics Workbench using the predicted peptide databases for A. thaliana,41Arabidopsis lyrata,42B. rapa,43Capsella rubella,5 and E. salsugineum1 using the following BLAST parameters: Expectation Value = 10, Word Size = 7, Filter Low Complexity = Yes, Protein Matrix = BLOSUM62, Gap Existence = 11, Gap Extension = 1. Peptide sequences for A. thaliana were obtained from ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Proteins/TAIR10_protein_lists/TAIR10_pep_20101214. Sequences for the remaining species were obtained from Phytozome (www.phytozome.net). BLASTn analyses of the previously published pennycress transcriptome19 against the genome assembly were performed using the following parameters: Match Cost = 2, Mismatch Cost = 3, Gap Existence = 2, Gap Extension = 2, Expectation Value = 10, Filter Low Complexity = Yes, Maximum Number of Hits = 15.2.5. Read mapping and variant detection for cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker designTrimmed and filtered sequencing reads from the Illumina HiSeq 2000 100 bp paired-end experiment were re-mapped to the genome assembly to identify potential heterozygosity or variation in the MN106 accession sequenced. Reads were mapped to the assembly in CLC Genomics Workbench using the ‘Map Reads to Reference’ tool (masking mode = no masking, mismatch cost = 3, insertion cost = 3, deletion cost = 3, length fraction = 0.95, similarity fraction = 0.95, global alignment = no, auto detect paired distances = yes, non-specific match handling = map randomly) and variants called using the Probabilistic Variant Detection tool (ignore non-specific matches = yes, ignore broken pairs = yes, minimum coverage = 10, variant probability = 90, require both forward and reverse reads = no, maximum expected variants = 2, ignore quality scores = no). Sites declared as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were manually examined to identify cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers in which one variant was a member of a six base recognition site for a DNA restriction endonuclease, and the other variant resulted in the loss of the restriction site. Four sites were identified, and primers were designed to amplify these regions for CAPS analysis (Supplementary Table S4). As a control, the primers were designed to flank both a CAPS site and a conserved restriction site that would be cleaved in both variants. DNA was isolated using the Mag-Bind EZ Plant DNA Kit (Omega BioTek, www.omegabiotek.com). Polymerase chain reactions were performed using Q5 High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, www.neb.com) with these DNA extracts and the corresponding CAPS primers to confirm the potential variants.2.6. Comparative analysis of genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism and transportA. thaliana, B. rapa, and Brassica oleraceae genes previously identified to be involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, breakdown, and transport were derived from a previous study.4 Alignments of predicted peptide sequences for each gene were performed in CLC Genomics Workbench using the Create Alignment tool (Gap open cost = 10, Gap extension cost = 1, End gap cost = Free, Alignment mode = Very accurate). Neighbour Joining trees were created in CLC Genomics Workbench (Protein distance measure = Jukes-Cantor, Perform bootstrap analysis = Yes, Replicates = 100). To examine expression levels of predicted gene models, Illumina RNAseq reads from the previously published transcriptome assembly19 were trimmed and filtered (Illumina TruSeq Trim Adaptor 3, Ambiguous Trim = Yes, Ambiguous Limit = 2, Quality Trim = Yes, Quality Limit = 0.05, Also search on reversed sequence = Yes, Remove 5' terminal nucleotides = Yes, Number of 5' terminal nucleotides to remove = 10, Remove 3' terminal nucleotides = no, Save broken pairs = Yes), and mapped to the annotated draft genome (Mapping Type = Map to gene regions only, Maximum number of hits for a read = 10, Strand Specific = Both, Count paired read as two = Yes, Expression Value = RPKM, Reference type = Genome annotated with genes and transcripts, Global alignment = no, Auto detect paired distances = Yes, Similarity fraction = 0.8, Length Fraction = 0.8, Mismatch cost = 2, Insertion cost = 3, Deletion cost = 3).3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyPennycress is a diploid species with a haploid number of seven chromosomes and a genome size of 539 Mb.12 In order to isolate a sufficient quantity of nuclear DNA for the various sequencing libraries used, nuclear DNA was isolated from nine plants derived from an MN106 isolate that had been maintained in the lab for several generations. This DNA was sequenced using both the Illumina and PacBio platforms, generating over 47 Gb of sequencing data representing over 87× coverage of the predicted genome size (Table 1). Illumina HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq reads were de novo assembled using the de Bruijn graph-based CLC Genomics Workbench assembler. PacBio reads were not used to create the de Bruijn graph, but instead they were only used to resolve ambiguities during the graph building stage. Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation statisticsSummary statistics for DNA sequencing libraries, genome assembly and scaffolding, and genome annotation.Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation statisticsSummary statistics for DNA sequencing libraries, genome assembly and scaffolding, and genome annotation.The initial CLC assembly resulted in 206,726 initial scaffolds =200 bp, encompassing 392,190,998 bp. Of this assembly, initial scaffolds over 1,000 bp (n = 50,064, 322,949,692 bp total length) were further joined using long-insert Illumina mate pair reads in SSPACE, and remaining gaps were filled using GAPFILLER. This analysis resulted in the formation of 6,768 final scaffolds that encompass over 343 Mb with an average scaffold length of 50,681 bp and N50 value of 140,815 bp (Table 1). Over 60% of the assembled scaffolds are over 10,000 bp long, with 902 scaffolds over 100,000 bp and 9 scaffolds over 1,000,000 bp (Supplementary Table S2). The longest 3,000 scaffolds represented over 85% of the assembly length (Supplementary Fig. S1). The 156,662 small scaffolds (<1000 bp) from the initial CLC assembly that were excluded from the final scaffolding and gap-filling manipulations encompassed 69,241,306 bp (Supplementary Table 2). These small initial scaffolds were excluded from further analyses as they likely represent sequences from repetitive regions of the genome, which are difficult to assemble and were unlikely to contribute to gene identification efforts. These small initial scaffolds represent a significant portion (12.8%) of the predicted genome size. With the addition of the initial small scaffolds, the total assembled length of the draft genome presented here is 412,253,695 bp, 76.5% of the predicted pennycress genome size of 539 Mb.As the draft genome is incomplete (<80% of the predicted genome size) and fragmented, developing a more complete and contiguous assembly will be important for both plant improvement efforts and answering basic questions about the genomics and evolution of pennycress. However, the reported contig N50 of 21 kb is well within the norm of other recently reported genome assemblies based on Illumina reads such as those for Aquilaria agallocha—14.6 kb,44Sesamum indium—52.2 kb,2Citrullus lantus—26.4 kb,45 and Cicer arietinum—23.54 kb.6 The sequence of contigs directly reflects the sequenced gene space, which is especially important for a species like pennycress where this information enables one to identify genes of interest whose manipulation via either overexpression or knockdown can be predicted to confer agronomically desirable phenotypes.3.2. Genome annotation with MAKERGenome annotation using the MAKER pipeline40 annotated 27,390 predicted protein-coding genes with an average total length of 2,195 bp, average coding sequence length of 1,238 bp, and an average of 5.541 exons/gene (Supplementary Dataset S2). More than 89% of the predicted gene models are supported by at least 5 RNA sequencing (RNAseq) reads from the previously published de novo transcriptome assembly, while 1452 gene models (5.3%) lack RNAseq read support (Supplementary Dataset S2). Over 85% of the predicted peptides (23,538) have at least one highly significant BLASTp hit (e < 1 × 10-5 and >70% positive percent) to an A. thaliana (TAIR10) predicted peptide (Table 1). Another 1,876 predicted peptides (6.8%) show a significant hit (e < 1 × 10-5), but at a lower positive percent value (>60%). Only 173 predicted peptides lacking an A.thaliana BLASTp hit were found (Expectation value >10) (Supplementary Dataset S2). BLASTn analyses of the 33,873 de novo assembled contigs from the pennycress transcriptome19 against the draft genome indicate a high level of completeness of the predicted gene space. Over 88% of transcripts (30,053) had BLASTn hits (=95% identity and e = 1 × 10-5) in the genome, while 95.8% of assembled transcripts (32,458) had a significant hit (e = 1 × 10-5) but at a lower percent identity threshold (>75%) (Supplementary Dataset S3). Only 167 transcriptome contigs lacked a BLASTn hit in the genome. (Expectation value >10) A separate BLASTn analysis of these 167 transcripts against the genomes of A. thaliana,41A. lyrata,42B. rapa,43C. rubella,5 and E. salsugineum1 revealed that 40 transcripts lacked any match to these five species, while the remaining 127 consisted of low quality and short hits, likely indicative of misassembled sequences from the de novo assembled transcriptome (Supplementary Dataset S4). The repetitive DNA content of the final pennycress genome scaffolds was assessed by RepeatMasker.46 It was found that repetitive elements constituted 24% of the draft genome. This analysis identified 78,812 retroelements encompassing >71 Mb of the assembly, consisting mainly of Gypsy/DIRS1-type, long-terminal repeats (60.3 Mb). 12,382 DNA transposons representing >5 Mb of the draft genome were also found, including hobo-Activator (0.8 Mb) and Tourist/Harbinger (0.9 Mb) type elements (Supplementary Table S3). Both the raw sequencing reads and assembled sequences have been submitted to NCBI, which has been supplemented by a pennycress genome database containing a JBrowse genome browser,47 BLAST database, and data repository available at pennycress.umn.edu.3.3. Comparative genomics of the pennycress genome assemblyOf the sequenced Brassicaceae genomes, pennycress is most closely related to E. salsugineum, which possesses a much smaller genome (241 Mb), but the same karyotype (n = 7).1,48 To evaluate the relative completeness of the genome assembly, we used a syntenic path assembly comparison of the pennycress assembly to the E. salsugineum reference genome.1 Pennycress genomic scaffolds >75 kb long, representing 241 Mb (>70%) of the assembly were compared with the 241 Mb reference genome of E. salsugineum. Large portions of the seven E. salsugineum pseudochromosomes possess a high degree of synteny with the pennycress assembly, indicative of the close evolutionary relationship between these two species, as well as a high level of completeness of conserved regions in the pennycress genome (Fig. 1A).

BLASTp analyses of the 27,390 predicted pennycress peptides against five separate databases containing these five Brassicaceae species revealed that over 23,000 of the pennycress peptides had highly similar hits in all five species, with E. salsugineum possessing the highest proportion (>89%) of highly similar predicted peptides (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Dataset S5). Similarly, in a BLASTp analysis of the pennycress predicted peptides against a single database containing all five Brassicaceae species, 15,414 predicted pennycress peptides had highly similar (e = 1 × 10-5 and =70% hit length) hits to E. salsugineum (Supplementary Dataset S6). An additional 8,965 predicted peptides had highly similar hits to B. rapa, A. lyrata, A. thaliana, and C. rubella, while 2,903 BLASTp hits fell outside of these parameters, and 108 of the predicted pennycress peptides lacked a BLASTp hit (Fig. 1C).3.4. Evaluation of zygosity in the sequenced populationThe draft genome was constructed using DNA isolated from nine plants that were several generations removed from a single population first identified in Coates, MN. A variant detection analysis was performed to assess the degree of homozygosity among the individual plants used for sequencing (see Materials and Methods for parameters used in this analysis). We detected 131,906 SNPs, which is ~1 SNP per 2.6 kb. Given the high level of sequencing coverage and stringent quality control, it is unlikely that the predicted SNPs were solely due to sequencing errors. We developed three hypotheses to explain the SNPs. First, these SNPs represent inappropriately assembled duplicated regions of the pennycress genome. In this analysis, if the first hypothesis were true and the declared SNPs were artificial, then we would not expect any differences between the nine different plants. Second, the SNPs may represent evidence of heterozygosity throughout the genome that would occur if the plants were prone to a high degree of outcrossing. If the second hypothesis were true, then we would expect that the nine plants would segregate at ~1 : 1 : 2 for the homozygosity of the presence or absence of a SNP or would be heterozygous with one chromatid containing the site and the other lacking the site, respectively. Third, distinct highly homozygous populations made up the original collection of plants used to isolate DNA that was sequenced. In this case, the genomes of any individual in the population would be expected to be largely homozygous at any particular locus.CAPS49 analysis using DNA isolated from progeny of the individual plants that were used to generate the draft genome was performed to distinguish between these three hypotheses. Primer sequences used to amplify regions used in the CAPS analysis shown in Fig. 2A are listed in Supplementary Table S4. Individuals were shown to either distinctly contain or lack the variant at four restriction enzyme sites, which eliminated the first hypothesis that these SNPs represented divergence in paralogous genes or misassembly of duplicated regions. Furthermore, none of the samples showed evidence of heterozygosity. Plants 3, 5, and 7 lacked the cut sites at the polymorphic regions, and plants 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 were homozygous for the cut sites (Fig. 2B). This supports the third hypothesis that the original MN106 population contained at least two distinct, highly homogenous populations. The fact that three individuals lacked all the cut sites and six individuals contained all the cut sites is likely due to the fact that at every CAPS locus, one prominent variant was detected in the variant detection analysis. Loci with the prominent variant that contained the six base restriction site were chosen for the CAPS analysis.

All scale bars equal 1 mm.Based on previous analyses, a high degree of homozygosity among wild pennycress individuals was not unexpected, as the cleistogamous development of pennycress flowers (pollination occurring inside a closed flower) minimizes outcrossing (Fig. 2C).11 These findings will aid pennycress breeding programmes, as progeny from crosses will be expected to readily self-pollinate with minimal need for isolation. In addition, the analysis provides an extra level of validation by showing that a subset of the identified SNPs are real and not created by sequencing or assembly errors. These SNPs have the potential to be used in breeding and geographical studies, and are available in Supplementary Dataset S7. These results suggest that the original MN106 population consists of at least two distinct haplotypes on the basis of the CAPS analysis. This suggests that even in mixed populations, the selfing nature of pennycress reduces heterozygosity. This is an important finding, as it will facilitate the isolation and generation of highly inbred populations.3.5. Analysis of genes involved in glucosinolate metabolismTo explore the functionality of our assembly, we determined how well the predicted gene space accounted for genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis. Glucosinolates (GSLs) are a diverse class of secondary metabolites common throughout the Brassicaceae that are important for plant/pathogen and plant/herbivore interactions.50 The underlying genetic mechanisms controlling the biosynthesis, transport, and breakdown of GSLs within the Brassicaceae have largely been dissected, with many of the genes responsible for this process having been characterized.51 Upon biosynthesis of the core glucosinolate structure (derived from one of several amino acids), GSLs generally lack bioactivity until plant tissue is damaged, leading to the hydrolysis of the GSL structure to one of several by-products. This breakdown process is mediated by enzymes called myrosinases, resulting in an unstable aglycone.51 The diversification of the final glucosinolate breakdown by-product is mediated by several classes of specifier proteins.52Historically, pennycress has been characterized by its unique ‘garlic-like’ aroma that has been attributed to high levels of allylthiocyanate,53 which is a major hydrolysis by-product of the major GSL in above-ground pennycress tissues: allylglucosinolate.54 The high level of GSLs in pennycress gives rise to another common name of the species, stinkweed.11 The high level of GSLs and GSL by-products in pennycress is of significant agronomic and economic interest. Animal feed containing pennycress seed has traditionally been considered undesirable due to the high levels of GSLs in pennycress.11 However, after seed is pressed for oil, the remaining seed meal remains high in protein55,56 and presents a potential new source of billions of kilograms per year of high protein meal. If varieties with low GSL levels in seed can be developed, there is a potential for using defatted pennycress meal as an animal feed supplement.BLASTp analyses were used to identify putative orthologues to known glucosinolate genes in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Dataset S2). Genes involved in the GSL core biosynthesis and breakdown pathway were derived from A. thaliana, B. rapa, and B. oleraceae.4 Putative orthologues were identified for GSL biosynthesis from methionine and tryptophan (Fig. 3A), along with several putative myrosinases (thioglucoside glucohydrolase—TGGs and atypical myrosinases—PEN2 and PEN3). Potential orthologues to several interesting specifier proteins were also identified (Fig. 3A—top). To obtain a semi-quantitative estimate of these predicted genes, RNAseq reads from the previously described transcriptome were used to obtain rough expression values for each gene model (Supplementary Dataset S1). As these RNAseq reads represent a global library representing various tissues, this analysis provides an initial probe into the pennycress genes potentially responsible for the unique glucosinolate composition of pennycress. For example, two putative myrosinases (Ta16900 and Ta16899) represent the 120th and 129th most highly expressed gene models, respectively (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Dataset S1). A modified vacuole phenotype1 (MVP1)-like pennycress gene was also identified (Ta16960—Fig. 3A). MVP1 in Arabidopsis interacts with the myrosinase TGG2 to modulate myrosinase activity.57Analysis of genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism and transport. (A) Overview of glucosinolate biosynthesis core structure (top) via methionine and tryptophan and breakdown (bottom) and corresponding orthologues in the pennycress genome pathway derived from Liu et al.4 Expression values (RPKM, in parentheses) are shown for each putative orthologues derived from the global RNAseq reads previously described.19 (B–G) Neighbour joining trees of TGG1/TGG2, MVP1, ESP, ESM1, GTR1, and GTR2-like predicted peptides (100 bootstrap replicates) from pennycress (identified in this study), Brassica rapa, and Brassica oleraceae.4Analysis of genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism and transport.

For example, epithiospecifier modifier1 (ESM1) in Arabidopsis represses the formation of nitriles and favours isothiocyanate production.58 An ESM1-like pennycress gene, Ta16274 (Fig. 3A), was among the top 200 expressed genes models and could explain the high levels of isothiocyanate in pennycress.54 Additionally, another potential hydrolysis product of GSLs, epithionitriles, can only be formed from GSLs possessing terminal double bonds in their side chain (allylglucosinolate, for example). As allylglucosinolate represents over 90% of GSLs in above-ground tissue,54 this ESM1-like pennycress gene could represent a key GSL specifier protein also responsible for epithionitrile production.The evolution of the identified specifier proteins was also examined. It has been previously reported that GSL-related genes commonly exist in tandemly duplicated regions of the genome within the Brassicaceae.4,59 The predicted peptides of A. thaliana TGG1 (Fig. 3B), MVP1 (Fig. 3C), ESP (Fig. 3D), ESM1 (Fig. 3E), GTR1 (Fig. 3F), and GTR2 (Fig. 3G) and corresponding orthologues in pennycress, B. rapa, and B. oleraceae were compared to determine sequence similarity and retention of tandemly duplicated regions throughout the genome. We identified three putative pennycress myrosinases with high sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis myrosinases TGG1 (AT5G26000) (Fig. 3B), with an additional predicted peptide (Ta16899) being more similar to B. oleraceae TGG2-like peptides (Bol9025706 and Bol017328). Only a single MVP1-like pennycress predicted peptide was identified in the draft genome (Fig. 3C). Three orthologous predicted peptides for AtESP (AT1G54040) were identified (Fig. 3D). The previously described TaTFP,54 which was cloned from a cDNA library, had a top BLASTp hit to Ta16961. However, the Ta16961 predicted peptide is nearly twice as long as the TaTFP predicted peptide (NCBI Accession JN244735) and appears to indicate either the TaTFP cDNA represented a unique splice variant or an erroneous splice site prediction from the annotation pipeline. An adjacent gene model, Ta16962, also had high similarity to TaTFP (Fig. 3D). Two tandem ESM1-like genes were also identified, similar to the tandemly duplicated orthologues in B. rapa (Bra027358 and Bra027359) and B. oleraceae (Bol005066 and Bol005067) (Fig. 3E).Several orthologues to important GSL transport genes were also identified. The GSL transporters glucosinolate transporter (GTR) 1 and 2 have been shown to serve as major transporters responsible for the loading of GSLs into developing seeds in Arabidopsis, and loss-of-function mutations in these genes result in significantly reduced levels of GSLs in seeds.60,61 The identification of putative GTR1 and GTR2 orthologues (Fig. 3F) represents important targets for improvement in our ongoing breeding programme.3.6. Identification of predicted orthologues of Arabidopsis genes that confer desirable phenotypes when mutatedThere are several important traits that will need to be addressed during the domestication process to make pennycress a viable crop, such as reducing seed dormancy and increasing rates of flowering. In Arabidopsis, complete or partial loss of function mutations in a number of genes can confer agronomically desirable traits such as increased seed size, improved seed oil composition, earlier flowering and reduced seed dormancy, seed glucosinolate content, and seed pod shatter (Table 2). Here we show that predicted orthologues of these genes are present in our draft assembly (Table 2). While this is not an exhaustive list of potential gene targets, this represents a number of well-characterized genes responsible for controlling these phenotypes. Mutations in these genes in Arabidopsis can confer what would be considered agronomically desirable phenotypes. For example, pennycress GTR1- and GTR2-predicted orthologues are highly conserved at the predicted peptide level (88.5 and 94.8% positive match, respectively). Additionally, identifying natural or induced mutations in key regulatory genes like DOG162,63 could lead to reduced levels of seed dormancy in pennycress. Similarly, developing winter annual lines that flower and mature rapidly in the spring should be possible through targeting genes involved in the vernalization and photoperiodic flowering time pathways, such as FLC and FRI19 (Table 2; Supplementary Dataset S8). The development of rapidly maturing lines will be particularly important in the upper Midwestern United States, as the shorter spring growing seasons at northern latitudes could limit the widespread adaptation of pennycress as a winter cover crop. By targeting specific important agronomic traits, and the underlying genetic mechanisms controlling these traits through the approaches mentioned above, we are poised to rapidly convert a wild weed species into a new highly valuable and sustainable winter oilseed crop.

The future of genomics-based pennycress improvementWhile the annotated draft genome for pennycress presented in this report will provide new tools for the domestication of a new winter oilseed crop, there is still much work to be done to develop a broad base of genomic resources for pennycress. For example, the creation of a complete, anchored reference genome is needed. The increasing length and quality of DNA sequencing reads from third-generation (single molecule—PacBio or Oxford Nanopore) sequencing technologies and new library preparation techniques such as Illumina TruSeq Synthetic Long-Reads (LRseq, formerly Moleculo)64 will allow for the de novo assembly of highly contiguous yet complex genomes. Combined with our ongoing development of a high-density genetic map using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq),65,66 the anchoring and ordering of a highly contiguous genome assembly to the genetic linkage map should be on the immediate horizon to produce a complete reference genome for pennycress. With a completed pennycress genome, the phylogenetic resolution of the Brassicaceae expanded lineage 2 can be improved, including providing tools for the phylogenetic resolution of Thlaspi species,67 and answering questions on pennycress genome structure. The draft pennycress genome presented here will enable the development of a genomics-based breeding programme. In addition, the identification of the gene space will allow the use of techniques such as mutation breeding, TILLING of ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized populations, DeTILLING of fast neutron-mutagenized populations, and genomic selection. The use of precise genome editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs should also be on the horizon, as pennycress can be transformed using the Agrobacterium-mediated vacuum infiltration floral dip method (John Sedbrook, personal communication). Pennycress has the potential to be planted on over 16 million hectares in the United States alone and produce over 22 billion litres of oil suitable as a biodiesel feedstock.20,21,24 The successful domestication of pennycress has the potential to benefit farmers and the environment, provide a new source of biofuel, and reduce greenhouse gases associated with global climate change. The genomics-based domestication of pennycress represents an exciting example of the development of a new crop species.Conflict of interest statementAny opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the US National Science Foundation.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was funded by the UMN Institute on the Environment, UMN CBS, and UMN College of Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Sciences, the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station, a DOE/USDA Plant Feedstock Genomics for Bioenergy program grant to MDM (USDA 2014-67009-22305), and by US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships to K.M.D. (00006595) and J.D.F.

IntroductionRice, commonly known to be salt sensitive,1 is greatly affected by soil salinity.2 Salinity affects rice growth in varying degree at all stages starting from germination through maturation.3–6 Excess salts adversely affect all major metabolic activities in rice, and cause overall decline in germination and seedling growth,4–7 leading ultimately to reduced growth and diminished grain yield. The reduction in major yield components including tiller numbers in plant and spikelet numbers per panicle has been reported to be the major cause of yield loss (27–50%) in rice cultivars during early reproductive panicle initiation stage under salinity stress.5,8,9 Millions of hectares in the humid regions of South and Southeast Asia are technically suited for rice production but are left uncultivated or are grown with very low yields because of salinity and problem soils. Salt-affected soils in arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, Africa and South America cause considerable agronomic problems. In Asia, 12 million ha of land area is thought to be salinity affected with India having >50% salinity affected area. Considerable variation for different yield contributing agronomic traits has been observed in diverse rice genotypes under salinity stress.10,11 Therefore, to maximize productivity of rice under saline soils, there is an urgent need to look for discovery of genes imparting salt tolerance and their introduction in salt-sensitive rice cultivars.12The dissection of salt tolerance traits has been carried out by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping approach using bi-parental populations. These studies have led to identification of both major and minor QTLs for various traits on different rice chromosomes.13–22 For example, Koyama et al.13 identified 11 QTLs for Na+ and K+ content related to salinity stress tolerance. Bonilla et al.14 mapped Saltol locus linked to major QTLs for Na+ and K+ uptake and Na+/K+ ratio on chromosome 1 explaining 64.3% phenotypic variance. Lin et al.15 mapped QTLs for root and shoot Na+/K+ concentration and transport on five rice chromosomes. Ammar et al.16 reported 25 QTLs for salt ion concentrations (Na+, K+ and Cl- measured in the leaf tissues at the reproductive stage) on rice chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 8. Pandit et al.17 reported eight QTLs for salt ion concentrations on rice chromosomes 1, 8 and 12, and Cheng et al.23 reported 12 QTLs for salt ion concentrations on rice chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 11, respectively. Most of these QTL mapping studies have used diverse indica and japonica intercross bi-parental mapping population to correlate with different measures of salinity stress tolerance and mapped hundreds of QTLs on 12 rice chromosomes. Many of these QTLs are specific to populations used for QTL mapping, since in bi-parental mapping populations, discovery of QTLs is limited by the germplasm used and therefore, use of a divergent set of germplasm resource is a prerequisite for identification of most of the agriculturally relevant loci. Association mapping that is based on genotyping of diverse germplasm set is an attractive approach for identification and mapping of such QTLs in plants.24–29 New statistical methods have been developed to analyse structured core/mini-core germplasm collections,30–32 and these methods have been efficiently applied to plants for candidate gene-based and genome-wide association mapping studies.33–35 Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has great potential for identifying valuable natural variations in trait-associated loci, as well as allelic variations in candidate genes underlying quantitative and complex traits, including those related to growth, development, stress tolerance and nutritional quality. Some previous studies in rice have been conducted to dissect genetic architecture of complex traits through GWAS.36,37 An extra advantage of the GWAS design for rice is the homozygous nature of most rice varieties, which makes it possible to employ a ‘genotype or sequence once and phenotype many times over’ strategy, whereby once the lines are genomically characterized, the genetic data can be reused many times over across different phenotypes and environments.37 GWAS thus has tremendous significance for identification of genes particularly for complex quantitative traits in rice. However, limited studies have been carried out in rice to identify genes/QTLs for abiotic stress tolerance using GWAS. This includes identification and mapping of genes/QTLs for aluminium stress tolerance28 using a genotyping array of 44,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)37 scanned in 383 diverse rice association panel. More recently, employing candidate gene-based association mapping approach, 11 SNPs mined in five known cloned salt-tolerance genes through EcoTILLING have been shown to be associated with salinity tolerance (Na+/K+ ratio equilibrium) in rice.38 However, there is no such report till now on identification of genes particularly for reproductive stage salinity tolerance using GWAS in rice.In the current assignment, we performed GWAS for identification of potential genes associated with salinity stress tolerance in rice by correlating the genotyping information obtained by using an SNP chip based on 6,000 stress-responsive genes with the phenotypic expression of 220 diverse rice (Oryza sativa) accessions for 14 morphological, biochemical (Na+ and K+ content) and agronomic traits.2. Materials and methods2.1. Phenotypic evaluation of germplasmThe experiment comprised of 220 rice accessions, which were obtained from various national and international institutes to assess the performance in normal and high saline stress conditions (Supplementary Table S1). These genotypes were evaluated in randomized complete block design with two replications under two environments, viz., normal (ECiw ~1.0 dS/m) and high salinity stress (ECiw ~10 dS/m) in micro plots at the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, India. This experimental site is situated at 29.43°N latitude and 76.58°N longitude and 245 m above the sea level. The 35-day-old seedlings from wet bed nurseries were transplanted using two seedlings per hill at a spacing of 15 × 20 cm. Basal fertilizers for the main crop were 120-60-60 kg of NPK/ha. The recommended agronomic practices were followed to get healthy and good crop. Twenty-one days after transplanting, salinity stress was imposed using 7 NaCl : 1 Na2SO4: 2 CaCl2 on equivalent basis. Salinity was recorded once in a week and maintained at desired level (ECiw ~10 dS/m) throughout the cropping season. Randomly five plants were tagged for each genotype in each replication, and phenotypic data were recorded for all traits. The response of the genotypes to salt stress was expressed using the stress susceptibility index (SSI) calculated according to Fischer and Maurer39 using the following formula: SSI = (1 - Ys/Yp)/D, where Ys = mean performance of a genotype under stress; Yp = mean performance of the same genotype without stress; D (stress intensity) = 1 - (mean Ys of all genotypes/mean Yp of all genotypes).2.2. Designing of SNP chip for high-throughput genotypingThe genotyping array used in our study was designed by selecting SNPs from differentially expressed transcripts in indica rice genotypes. For this, two rice genotypes, i.e. Nagina22 and CSR30 were grown, respectively, under drought and salt stress, and the whole transcriptome was sequenced (unpublished results). A set of 6,500 transcripts, differentially expressed in both genotypes and 8,884 non-transposable elements-related annotated rice genes (MSU, version 6.1) distributed over 12 rice chromosomes, were selected, and these gene sequences from whole-genome sequencing data of six contrasting rice genotypes (unpublished) generated using Next Generation ABI-SOLiD platform were co-aligned. One SNP from each of the selected gene was identified from these co-aligned sequences and from previously reported genome-wide Perlegen re-sequencing information among 20 rice varieties.40 The identified 15,384 genic SNPs were further mapped physically (bp) on 12 rice chromosomes (Pseudomolecule 6.1). Finally, 6,000 SNPs were selected for array designing, which were distributed at physical interval of <100 kb on 12 rice chromosomes. The physical distance (kb) between SNP loci varied from 16 kb in chromosome 3 to 98 kb in chromosome 11 with an average of 51 kb (Fig. 1). The 6,000 SNP chip array included 2,456 SNPs from the previously reported genome-wide Perlegen re-sequencing data, and remaining 3,544 SNPs were identified from our transcriptome sequencing data. Functional annotation of 6,000 SNPs carrying stress-related rice genes (Fig. 2) revealed maximum correspondence to abiotic stress-responsive genes (73.5%) followed by biotic stress-related genes (16.3%), unknown expressed genes (6%) and minimum correspondence to hypothetical proteins (4%). The SNPs from abiotic stress-related genes were associated mostly with metabolism and protection (26%) followed by zinc finger, Myb, Zip, heat shock, ethylene response element-activator protein-2 (AP-2) and dehydration-responsive element-binding transcription factors (15%). Of these 6,000 SNPs, 5,246 had satisfactory custom design score amenable for multiplexing and development of high-throughput assay in Illumina Infinium platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and this 5,246 SNP array was used for genotyping of 220 rice accessions.

Genomic DNA isolation and array hybridizationGenomic DNA was extracted from pooled young green leaf tissue from five plants of each accession following cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method described by Doyle and Doyle.41 DNA was quantified using NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Concentrations were adjusted to a minimum of 50 ng/µl, and 4 µl aliquots were used for the Illumina Infinium® genotyping assay. Approximately 200 ng of unlabelled rice genomic DNA was used for hybridization. The customized array, employing exclusively Illumina Infinium® II design probes and dual color channel assays (Infinium HD Assay Ultra, Illumina), was used for genotyping, following the manufacturer’s recommendations.2.4. SNP genotype callingSNP genotyping data were analysed using Genome Studio V2010.1 (Illumina Inc.). SNP genotypes were called using genotyping module integrated in the software where individual SNP is viewed as GenoPlots. Data quality was rapidly confirmed with internal controls and other QC functions such as GenTrain and GenCall scores.42 After calling the data automatically, the SNPs were re-scored and checked for their presence in a canonical cluster to get a GenTrain score >0.7. We removed the samples from analysis that had call rates <0.89 and the SNPs with norm R values <0.2. Initially, using these criteria, 220 accessions and 4,929 SNPs with valid and robust genotyping data were selected for association analysis.2.5. Population structureTo estimate the number of subgroups in the panel, both principal components analysis (PCA) and STRUCTURE 2.3.4 program were used.33–35 Only those SNPs, having both missing data <20% and minor allele frequency (MAF) = 5%, were included for STRUCTURE program. For PCA analysis, genomic association and prediction integrated tool (GAPIT)43 was used. The final number of principal components (PCs) that adequately explain population structure was determined through scree plot generated by GAPIT. The Efficient Mixed-Model Association (EMMA)44 was used to correct for confounding effects due to subpopulation structure and relatedness between individuals. Genetic divergence among subpopulations was detected through net nucleotide distance estimated by STRUCTURE.2.6. Estimation of LD decay in riceGenome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed among the 220 accessions (association panel) and subpopulations (determined by population structure) by pairwise comparisons among the 4,191 SNP markers (with MAF > 0.02) using r2, the correlation in frequency among pairs of alleles across a pair of SNP loci. For all pairs of SNPs, r2 was calculated using the --r2 --ld-window-kb 2,000 --ld-window 99999 --ld-window-r2 0 command in PLINK.45 The command was used to calculate LD association among SNP pairs to a distance of 2,000 kb. After excluding SNPs with MAF < 0.02, we obtained 4,191 (~85%) SNPs across the O. sativa panel. For these high-quality SNPs, missing genotypes were imputed using fastPHASE.46 Within each subpopulation, we calculated r2 for all pairs of SNPs. For LD decay analysis, 2,000 kb LD region covered between SNP pairs was classified into bins of 20 kb, and r2 values were plotted against distance in kb. To graphically view the LD (r2) between SNP pairs in the entire panel, LD was calculated between 50 subsequent SNPs using sliding window option of Analysis by Association, Evolution, and Linkage (TASSEL 3.0) software.47 The Solid Spine of LD algorithm48 was also used to graphically find out the regions with minimum D' value of 0.8, as suggested by Duggal et al.492.7. Genome-wide association analysisFor association analysis of our data set (4,929 SNP genotyping and phenotyping information of 220 accessions), GAPIT was used that involves EMMA (executed by R package) and CMLM (compressed mixed linear model)/P3D (population parameters previously defined) interfaces to conduct GWAS, and predicts genomic regions associated with traits. For CMLM, the relatedness matrix, measured as the genetic similarity between individuals and IBS (identical by state) values, was used to estimate random effects. The kinship matrix (K) estimated from SNP genotyping data was used jointly with population structure (Q value) to improve statistical power of association. For fixed effects, PCs through PCA analysis and Q-matrix through STRUCTURE were used as covariates for association analysis. Scree plot of PCA analysis suggested first three components as most informative, which were used as covariate matrix in K + P (kinship + PCA) model. For K + Q (kinship + Q-matrix) model, a file generated through run K = 3 in STRUCTURE program was used as covariate matrix. The critical P-values for assessing the significance of SNPs were calculated based on a false discovery rate (FDR) separately for each trait,50 which was found to be highly stringent. An FDR cut-off of 0.05 was used for determining significance.3. Results3.1. Success of genotyping arrayThe array designed with 5,246 SNPs in our study was successfully used to genotype all the 220 rice accessions. The data generated through Illumina Infinium platform were loaded in Genome Studio software where, after cluster refinement with optimum GenTrain (>0.7) and GenCall score (>0.3), 4,929 polymorphic SNPs (~94%) were identified. After excluding the SNPs with MAF < 0.02, finally, 4,191 (~80%) high-quality SNPs genotyped across 220 rice accessions were utilized for GWA mapping.3.2. Genetic structure of rice accessionsUsing PCA, most of the genetic variation (66%) in the accessions was explained by first two PCs. Based on 4,191 SNPs, the first PC explained almost 52% of genetic variation, whereas PC II explained 14%. The scree plot generated through GAPIT recommended the first three components as informative, where descent changes gradually (Fig. 3A). When we plotted the first two components against each other, three subpopulations were identified. A total of 130 accessions were clustered as a single large subpopulation (I) (Fig. 3B). For inferring the most likely number of populations among 220 accessions in STRUCTURE, the transformation method51 was used, and similar to PCA, three subpopulations were identified (Fig. 3C). Forty-four per cent of the accessions (97/220) did not show any admixture, 46% accessions (101/220) showed up to 20% admixture, while the remaining 10% (22/220) were found to be highly admixed.

(A) Scree plot from GAPIT showing the selection of PCs for association study. (B) PCA plot of first two components. (C) Bayesian clustering of 220 rice accessions using STRUCTURE program.We examined allele sharing across the accessions by calculating IBS coefficients among all pairs of accessions. Most of the admixture was shared between accessions of Subpopulations II and III in IBS sharing heatmap (Supplementary Fig. S1). Except some of the accessions from Panvel, Raigarh, India, the mean IBS sharing was the highest between the other accessions from this region (0.96), and they were placed in a group of accessions from Haryana and IARI, New Delhi, with little IBS sharing. The second highest IBS sharing (0.86) subgroup was found in the Subpopulation III, having all accessions from Kerala, India. The allele frequency divergence among the three putative subpopulations was found maximum between the Subpopulations I and III followed by II and III. The lowest differentiation was between the Subpopulations I and II. Genetic diversity, measured as the average distances (expected heterozygosity) between individuals in the same cluster, was found low in all the clusters (0.18).3.3. Patterns of LD in association panelThe LD decay rate was measured as the chromosomal distance (kb) at which the average pairwise correlation coefficient (r2) dropped to half its maximum value.36 The binned r2 values were mapped against the physical distance (kb) across the genome. Overall, the LD for SNPs at 20 kb distance from each other was 0.50 (r2), which decayed to its half value (~0.25) at around 300 kb. However, further decay in r2 was found very slow and paralleled at 0.15 up to 2 Mb (Fig. 4). Out of total pairwise LD events, only 14% pairs showed r2 above 0.5. When LD was calculated population-wise, the maximum average (r2 < 0.70) was observed for Subpopulation I, which was maintained at r2 > 0.21 up to 2 Mb. The average LD for Subpopulation III was observed comparatively low (0.44), and decayed half to its initial value at 240 kb. The average minimum LD was also found very low (0.12) for Subpopulation III. The maximum and minimum LD for Subpopulation II were 0.50 and 0.15, respectively. PLINK was also used to calculate chromosome-wise LD between SNP pairs, which was found maximum (0.40) for chromosomes 3 and 7, and minimum (r2 < 0.23) for chromosome 11. Except chromosomes 8, 10 and 11, all other chromosomes showed LD above 0.30. On an average, 84 kb distance was observed between SNP pairs before applying MAF < 0.02, which increased to 95 kb after correcting for MAF. The average maximum distance (~125 kb) was observed for chromosomes 8 and 12 while minimum distance (~69 kb) was observed for chromosome 3. When LD heatmap generated through TASSEL was studied, the regions of high LD with significant P-values were found to be interspersed between the low LD regions throughout the genome. Comparison of LD patterns and LD decay in the whole panel and subgroups. The whole genome r2 values from PLINK are first sorted considering distance, and then divided into 100 blocks of 20 kb. The r2 values in each block are averaged and plotted against the genetic distance for different subgroups.Comparison of LD patterns and LD decay in the whole panel and subgroups.

Phenotypic variation among accessions for salinity tolerance traitsFrequency distributions of traits observed under normal and salt stress among the 220 accessions are presented in the Supplementary Figs S2a and b, respectively. Some of the traits such as yield were the cumulative outcome of its component traits as determined by correlation and path analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). The simple correlation coefficients were found positive for yield and its component traits such as productive tillers, filled grains, seed weight and spikelet fertility under normal and stress condition. Under stress condition, yield was found negatively correlated with Na+ content (-0.24) and Na+/K+ ratio (-0.22), while it was positive with K+ content. Na+ content was found negatively correlated with K+ content (-0.12). Under stress, Na+/K+ ratio was found in positive correlation with Na+ content (0.75) while negatively correlated with K+ content (-0.48), as expected. The spikelet fertility was also negatively correlated with Na+ content (-0.22) and Na+/K+ ratio (-0.23) while positively correlated with K+ content (0.13) under stress. In contrast, all the susceptibility indices were found positively correlated with Na+ content and Na+/K+ ratio while negatively correlated with K+ content. Grain weight also showed high correlation with grain length, but its association with grain width was found low but positive. The traits observed under normal and stress conditions were found independent of each other except for grain length. The ratio of filled grains/unfilled grains reduced maximally under salt stress in the third largest subpopulation. The average Na+ content and Na+/K+ ratio were the highest in the Subpopulation II at normal condition, but it was maintained low in the population after salt stress. The drop in yield under salt stress was observed comparatively more in the largest subpopulation as spikelet fertility was found minimum (50%) in this population under stress condition. Spikelet fertility was found to be 56 and 57% for Subpopulations I and II, respectively. Overall, under control condition, the spikelet fertility varied from 62 to 99%, while under salt stress, it decreased and varied from 1 to 95%. The average grain length was found maximum in Subpopulation III under both normal and salinity conditions. The canonical correlation coefficients were found high for phenotypic traits under salt stress conditions compared with normal condition. For instance, the canonical correlation in stress category was estimated 0.81 between productive tillers and yield, while it was only 0.29 under normal condition. The heritability calculated for each trait among accessions ranged from 0.61 to 0.89 with an average of 0.72. The heritability for the flowering time was observed to be low. A significant level of phenotypic variation thus was recorded among the accessions used in the study for salinity response.3.5. GWASAll the 220 rice accessions in our study were phenotyped for 12 agronomic traits, and two assays of Na+ and K+ accumulation were also conducted. Using 4,191 SNPs, GAPIT produced association signals for various traits under control as well as stress condition. The association signals were more in number and potent under stress condition. SNPs were considered significant only after adjusting for multiple testing at 0.05 threshold level. The associated loci in this study for different traits were interspersed on all the chromosomes. Using the CMLM approach, we successfully identified both known associations (for example, enrichment in a priori candidate genes and previously reported QTLs from rice) as well as new candidate loci in the rice genome. The results of our genome-wide association scans are summarized in Supplementary Figs S4–11 where we showed the SNP trait associations discovered in the association panel using CMLM approaches.Under control condition, 2, 9 and 7 SNPs were significantly associated with unfilled grains, percent spikelet fertility and plant height, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). For unfilled grains, both of the significant signals were located on chromosome 9 (10154727 and 10223755). All the top SNPs from this region were found in high LD. For percent spikelet fertility, out of nine significant SNPs, four were detected on chromosome 2, one on chromosome 5 (6251237), two on chromosome 7 (22665019 and 22725607) and the remaining two on chromosome 9 (10154727 and 10223755). However, association peaks were detected only on chromosomes 2, 7 and 9 while chromosome 5 SNP was reported significant without any associated SNPs. Some of the results regarding unfilled grains and spikelet fertility were found identical, as both the significant SNPs from chromosome 9 for unfilled grains were also found significant for spikelet fertility. A GWAS peak on chromosome 3 between the coordinates, 14123489 and 14156542 for unfilled grains, was also detected for spikelet fertility, but in both the cases, the top SNP (P = 0.081) from this peak was found below the FDR-adjusted P-value. For plant height, seven SNPs on chromosome 4 covering a region of 2 Mb (8559661–12215278) were found significant with same level of FDR correction (0.011) and phenotypic variation (15%) explained by each SNP in the block. The region was found as a large LD region having high r2 with significant P-values.Compared with control condition, the number of significant SNPs increased for stress condition. Under stress condition, the significant signals were detected for yield/plant, filled grains, productive tillers, spikelet fertility, spikelet fertility SSI, Na+ content and Na+/K+ ratio. Except for Na+ content and Na+/K+ ratio, most of the significant signals were common for different traits observed under stress condition. In total, 44 SNPs were found significant for these traits except Na+/K+ ratio for which most of the signals were different. For Na+/K+ ratio, five GWAS peaks containing 20 SNPs were recorded on chromosomes 1, 4, 6 and 7 (Supplementary Table S2). Twelve of the 20 SNPs were located on chromosome 1, on or near the Saltol, a known and highly investigated region for salinity tolerance in rice. Significant association signals on chromosome 4 for Na+/K+ ratio comprised five SNPs, originating from two GWAS peaks located on two distant regions. From the first peak, three SNPs (4: 13497584, 13649124 and 14014367) achieved the FDR threshold level (P< 0.039) while two (4: 34164920 and 34292214) achieved threshold level (P < 0.040) from second peak. The locations of these GWAS peaks were tracked between the coordinates 13.4–14.0 and 34.1–34.5 Mb, respectively. Another GWAS peak was reported at one end of chromosome 6, and two SNPs (6: 902913 and 1460570) from this peak were found significant (FDR-adjusted P < 0.046). The fifth GWAS peak was observed from chromosome 7; however, a single SNP (7:19655274) from this region achieved FDR-adjusted threshold level (P = 0.026). When top SNPs from this region were arranged, the origin of the peak was tracked between the coordinates, 19655274 and 25919115. Only one SNP located on chromosome 1 (41550991) was found significant (FDR-adjusted P = 0.002) for Na+ content under stress. None of the SNPs showed significant peaks for K+ concentration under stress condition.Out of total 44 SNPs for various traits observed under salinity, 27 were found common for all the traits. Individually, 32, 35, 33, 37 and 37 SNPs were, respectively, associated with filled grains, productive tillers, yield/plant, percent spikelet fertility under stress and percent spikelet fertility SSI (Supplementary Table S3). Excluding common ones, only 2, 2, 1 and 3 SNPs were found uniquely associated for productive tillers, filled grains, yield/plant under stress and percent spikelet fertility under stress, respectively. In our study, association peaks were observed on all the chromosomes. However, single SNP associations, one each on chromosome 6 and 8, were observed significant. A significant SNP (29212927) on chromosome 4 was found common for all the five above-discussed traits, whereas another SNP (16517190) from the same chromosome was observed only for productive tillers. An SNP (23127237) on chromosome 11 was also found significant only for productive tillers. Two SNPs (10654854 and 41550991) on chromosome 1 and one SNP (29212927) on chromosome 4 were found common for above-discussed traits as well as for Na+/K+ ratio under stress. The peak significant SNPs from chromosome 10 for all these traits were distributed between the coordinates 5864939 and 14809695. All the association signals for percent spikelet fertility and spikelet fertility stress suceptibility index (SFSSI) were found identical.The LD heatmap generated by TASSEL across the whole genome showed that SNPs, which are in association with different salt indices, were found in LD blocks of various r2 intensities. Some of the SNPs were found in large LD blocks of high and significant r2 values. Most of the SNPs were found in small LD blocks containing 2–10 SNPs. However, three SNPs, two from chromosome 2 (6651494 and 22253258) and one from chromosome 8 (5109310), were not found in LD with other SNPs. The average r2 values for all the three SNPs were found below the background level (r2 < 0.2).3.6. Phenotypic variance explained by the significant SNPsFor plant height under control condition, seven SNPs in a cluster on chromosome 4 (8559661–12215278) were found significant and each of the seven significant SNPs explained almost 15% of the phenotypic variation. SNPs found significant for spikelet fertility under control condition explained on an average 5% of the phenotypic variation where both the SNPs on chromosome 7 contributed maximum 6% variation. A graph summarizing the QTL regions associated with all traits, as well as the percent of the phenotypic variation explained by significant SNPs for each trait, is provided in Fig. 5. For Na+/K+ ratio under stress condition, the minimum effect locus contributed 6% while its maximum effect locus contributed 12% to the phenotypic variation with an average of 9%. Among the traits tagged under stress condition, the maximum average phenotypic variation was explained for productive tillers (15%), followed by yield/plant (12%). For SFSSI, 37 significant SNPs explained on an average 11% of the phenotypic variation. Summary of percentage of variance explained by significant loci in the study.

DiscussionSalinity is a serious constraint to rice productivity, and due to a lack of enough improved salinity-tolerant rice varieties, most of the regions affected by salinity are left barren. To improve rice productivity in such areas, we need to identify a number of novel genes and alleles associated with such complex quantitative salinity tolerance traits in diverse rice accessions that are well adapted to changing climatic conditions and pyramid them. Several earlier studies have led to identification of QTLs for salinity tolerance in rice using bi-parental mapping populations, which, due to low resolution, scan only limited number of recombination events, and do not allow identification of many evolutionarily valid and robust QTLs for salinity stress. An alternate and complementary approach is GWAS that takes advantage of historical recombination events, which have accumulated over thousands of generations in historical populations and thus enable high-resolution mapping for identification of possible target genomic regions for complex quantitative traits in rice.36,37 The sample size of 220 rice accessions is much smaller than used in human GWAS studies, where sample sizes often exceed 10,000 individuals, but is larger or similar to the number of accessions used in GWAS in Arabidopsis thaliana,25,52,53O. sativa,36Zea mays54,55 and Medicago truncatula56 in which phenotypic data could be collected in common environments on replicated genotypes. The differences in genetic balance (homozygosity in self-pollinated species or inbreds of cross-pollinated species against heterozygosity in humans) and the use of germplasm resources including landraces, improved and obsolete varieties, make GWAS work for such crop species even with a small panel size.The 5,246 SNP array designed for Illumina Infinium assay was efficient enough to rapidly genotype SNP loci in 220 rice accessions with high precision and success rate. The estimated SNP genotyping success rate (~94%) and missing genotype information (~5%) were comparable to that documented previously using Illumina GoldenGate assay in rice,57,58 Affymatrix custom array (44K)37 and with a recently developed Illumina Infinium RiceSNP50 array.59 This suggests the reliability and utility of the SNP chip array for high-throughput SNP genotyping in rice using Infinium assay. About 67% of the SNPs in the array were annotated as ‘coding’ SNPs and the remaining in the 5'UTRs (33%) as ‘regulatory’ SNPs. SNPs within genic regions have greater potential to affect gene function and are usually more informative.59 Also, the enrichment of array with plenty of such genic SNPs is worthwhile in genome-wide studies focussed to map genes for biotic/abiotic stress tolerance.So far, ~70 salt tolerance QTLs had been located in rice using bi-parental mapping populations,60,61 but fine mapping and narrowing down reports are limited. Only, Saltol QTL region14 has been inspected widely, and three genes (SKC1, SalT and pectinesterase) are annotated and functionally characterized in this region.62,63 The Na+/K+ ratio is an important ion balancing parameter for salt tolerance in rice, and our GWA mapping results identified this important region as a dense GWAS peak covering the Saltol region, which helps control K+ homeostasis under salinity.62 Previous studies claimed that Saltol controls salinity only at seedling stage and suggested that tolerance at seedling and reproductive stages is regulated by a different set of genes and QTLs.11 However, in our study, where all the traits were measured at reproductive stage, the Saltol region was mapped with a set of highly significant SNPs on chromosome 1. In our study, the results for Na+/K+ ratio were found more important than other traits as all the significant SNPs for this trait were found in complete LD. The results of mixed model considering Na+/K+ ratio are shown in Figs 6 and 7. The significant SNPs detected on chromosome 1 on or near the Saltol region were novel in our study and were not reported earlier from the three known genes of Saltol. All the 12 SNPs were scattered between the coordinates 9.6 and 14.5 Mb, and the top one was located at 12.8 Mb. The top hit from this region was from the coordinate 1:12854366 (LOC_Os01g22900; neutral/alkaline invertase), the other one was from the coordinate 1:12831995 (LOC_Os01g22870; expressed protein). Two significant SNPs (1: 11608731 and 12054948) from this region were between the two Saltol specific genes (SKC1 and pectinesterase). The region was found with the most prominent GWAS peak in the study with very high LD (average r2 = 0.56). Its relevance for salt tolerance in seedling stage has already been explored, and it has been widely used for introgression into a wide range of recipient elite cultivars. The mapping of novel functional allelic variants detected in the genes underlying Saltol QTL in current study at reproductive stage is a significant finding, which once validated can effectively be utilized in rice breeding programs to enhance salt tolerance.

The alongside colour-coded graphs are representing MAF, P-value and r2 of significant SNPs from the respective chromosomes.For Na+/K+ ratio, chromosome 4 was also found important, and two different regions on this chromosome were mapped for the trait. SNPs on this chromosome showing significant associations were found in an LD block. This LD block is situated near a QTL region for Na+ concentration and Na+/K+ ratio, found by Koyama et al.13 However, this region has not yet been fine mapped. We investigated all the locus ID spanning this LD block with available GEO data set (GSM159265) for salinity tolerance and found that three genes, i.e. LOC_Os04g23550, LOC_Os04g23580 and LOC_Os04g24110, were significantly up-regulated under salt stress with fold change value of 3.6, 9.26 and 3.12, respectively, in salt-tolerant rice variety Agami. Another association peak located at the end of this chromosome with two top SNPs (34164920 and 34292214) explaining equal phenotypic variation at the same significance level showed very high LD with surrounding 13 SNPs covering a distance of 1.2 Mb. Two QTLs for salt tolerance and potassium concentration were mapped just prior to this region, respectively, by Lin et al.20 and Cai and Morishima.64 Investigation of available GEO data set (GSM159265) of the entire locus from this region identified four genes, i.e. LOC_Os04g57760, 57800, 57810 and 57850 with 7.50-, 2.10-, 4.24- and 3.90-fold change in expression, respectively.For Na+/K+ ratio, the most significant SNP (6:1460570; LOC_Os6g03700) from an association peak located at one end of the chromosome 6 was surrounded by two dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (LOC_Os6g03670 and LOC_Os6g03750) and two calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) proteins. All these proteins, including the significant one of our study, are located between the coordinates, 1435857 and 1478931, covering only 43 kb region. Out of these proteins, OsDREB1C (LOC_Os6g03670) is known and characterized for salinity stress tolerance in Arabidopsis65 and in rice.66 This region also carried the QTL for Na+ ion concentration proposed by Koyama et al.13A single SNP (19655274) identified on chromosome 7 in this panel is in the gene, LOC_Os07g32880 (ATP synthase gamma chain, putative, expressed). When top SNPs from this region of Manhattan plot (<0.01 simple P-value) were ordered, the region was tracked between the coordinates, 18204319 and 21821714. This region was not mapped with earlier known QTLs for salinity-related parameters such as Na+ content or for Na+/K+ ratio; however, a cluster of QTLs for yield-related components under salt stress was identified in this region by Mohammadi et al.67For sodium content, the only significant SNP (FDR-adjusted P = 0.002) was reported from chromosome 1: 41550991 (LOC_Os01g71240) in the gene calcium-transporting ATPase, plasma membrane type. Though the role of such plant Ca2+ATPases in salinity stress68,69 is known, its significant association with Na+ content observed in the study needs enrichment of the region with SNPs and further LD mapping studies.When the traits such as yield/plant, productive tillers, filled grains, percent spikelet fertility and SFSSI observed under stress were employed for association mapping, typically same set of SNPs hit all these parameters with little difference in P-value. A very high canonical correlation was observed among all these traits under stress, which probably led to co-localization of GWAS peaks containing the same set of SNPs. Association signals were not detected as dense GWAS peaks for these traits. All these traits are very critical for reproductive stage and showed greater variability with very high range correlations under stress. Susceptibility indices were computed for yield and its related traits, of which we found associations only for SFSSI and not for yield. Similarly, Pandit et al.17 detected QTL (qSSISFH8.1) on chromosome 8 only for SFSSI and not for seed weight SSI and yield SSI. One of our significant SNPs (chr8: 5109310) for SFSSI overlapped the QTL, qSSISFH8.1, which harboured another QTL (qNaSH8.1) for straw sodium content under high salinity. This SNP also overlapped with a region for high salt concentration discovered by Islam et al.70 An SNP (chr5: 766912), significant for all the traits under stress, was found in the region of a QTL (qNar/Kr5) for Na+/K+ ratio in root discovered by Ahamdi and Fotokian.18 Two significant SNPs (7:2453894 and 7:22268862) were detected near qSNC7 and qSDS7 discovered by Lin et al.15 Another QTL (qRNC9) for root Na+ concentration was overlapped by two SNPs on chromosome 9 (16503353 and 17002144). An SNP on chromosome 9 (6030743) showed significant signal within the range of qSNC9/qSKC9 QTL for shoot Na+ and K+ concentration discovered by Wang et al.71 All the SNPs that showed significant association on chromosome 10 (5864939–14809695) were found between the markers aligned with a QTL discovered by Islam et al.70 for high salt tolerance. At reproductive stage, finding a number of regions underlying salinity stress in current panel of rice indicates complexity of genetic architecture of this trait, which cannot be unravelled by a single GWAS study or analysis method. To provide concrete evidence that they do affect the trait, the significantly associated genomic regions in the study can further be explored to find causal variants.Apart from SNPs that had association with known QTLs for salinity tolerance, there were also a few SNPs, which hit specific genes that were known or functionally characterized for salt stress. A significant SNP on chromosome 1 (40514883) for filled grain under stress was found near two functionally characterized genes namely OsNAC6/SNAC2 for drought, salt and cold tolerance in rice during seedling development.72,73 Another SNP on chromosome 1 (7304902) showed significant signals near a salt stress related root protein (RS1/LOC_Os01g13210), functionally annotated for its role in salt resistance, and located 50 kb away from the tagged SNP.74 The tagged SNP and the subsequent region through RS1 gene were found in high LD range in our study. An SNP on chromosome 9 (16503353) that showed significant association for productive tillers under stress was found 100 kb apart from a known gene, Osdg1 (delayed seed germination) for salinity tolerance. Other SNPs, which were identified as significant, might have their direct role in salt tolerance, or alternatively, it may be that these SNPs are in LD with genes that are yet to be identified and arrayed on the chip used. The region across the tagged locus is critical to the size of the target region, but it is still unclear which r2 threshold should be set in defining LD structure, as the causal SNP potentially could be in LD with the associated SNP at an r2 of 0.2 or even less.75 Finding association in or near such candidate genes although highlights the importance of the candidate gene-based chip, such single-variant trait associations need enrichment of these genomic regions either with more SNPs or complete re-sequencing to avoid spurious associations. The use of lower density chip might be a factor in restricting amplification of these GWAS peaks. The involvement of larger panel coupled with higher density of SNPs would not only improve the stringency of GWAS peaks identified but also detect new QTLs of minor effects, which have been completely skipped in this study.The current SNP array also generated association signals for phenotypic traits plant height, unfilled grains and spikelet fertility under normal growth conditions. Dozens of genes and QTLs regulating plant height in rice have been identified previously. Mixed model approach in our study detected strong signals of a cluster of seven significant SNPs within the range of Fh4-1, on chromosome 4, a known QTL for plant height. For spikelet fertility, five SNPs were found significant; however, the phenotypic variance explained by them was found below 7%. Signals for spikelet fertility were found very strong on chromosomes 2, 7 and 9. Significant SNPs on chromosome 2 overlapped with a known QTL (qSS2) for spikelet sterility under control that was identified by Li et al.76 However, these SNPs were not detected from peak region of qSS2 QTL, rather overlapped with end of the QTL region. Top SNPs on chromosome 7 were also found close to a known QTL for spikelet fertility under natural environment, earlier identified by He and Xu.77 However, significant SNPs detected on chromosome 9 did not overlap with any earlier known QTL for spikelet fertility and also found significant for unfilled grains. All the GWAS peaks for spikelet fertility from the novel regions in current set of association panel can be good candidates for further mapping and functional characterization.In genome-wide association studies, SNP-trait association depends on the phenotypic variance in the population explained by the SNP. Recent GWAS in plants have explained a much greater proportion of the phenotypic variation, and the assumption that common genetic variation explains common phenotypic variation holds.78 In the current set of data, the phenotypic variance explained individually by SNPs for different traits with or without salinity stress was in complete concordance with earlier studies on plants such as rice37 and spring wheat.79 Its wider range (5–20%) for most of the traits under stress as well as without stress at reproductive stage entails genome-wide significance and high statistical power of current panel of 220 rice accessions.44 Previous GWA studies on Arabidopsis confirmed that for some of the traits, meaningful results can be obtained even with <100 accessions.25 In our study, for most of the traits, the variation was captured by a single SNP or with a few SNPs from a particular genomic region due to medium density SNP array, unlike the 44K array37 and ~3.6 million SNPs used earlier27 where there is strong possibility of dense GWAS peaks due to a very high LD between adjacent genotyped SNPs. However, an earlier study conducted to evaluate the extent of LD within different subgroups of rice suggested that a modest number of SNPs across the genome may be sufficient for undertaking genome-wide LD mapping studies in rice.805. ConclusionGenotyping of 220 indica rice genotypes using a custom-designed 6K genic SNP array successfully detected SNPs associated with a number of phenotypic traits at reproductive stage under salinity stress. The indica diversity panel selected in the study to unveil the genomic regions relevant for salinity tolerance was found diverse to the extent that SNP-trait associations were stronger under salinity compared with control treatment. The novel functional allelic variants within the genes underlying Saltol, a major QTL, known to control salinity tolerance at seedling stage are also identified. This finding helps us to delineate alleles in the genes harbouring one of the most important Saltol QTLs at the reproductive stage as against the earlier views that different gene networks are responsible for conferring salinity tolerance at seedling and reproductive stages. Identification of Saltol and other stress-related genomic regions in the study indicates precise evaluation of the phenotypic traits under salinity stress as well as the potential of the SNP array in detecting associations. Besides Saltol, we found some other GWAS peaks with small to moderate effects, which suggest that salinity is a complex trait and controlled by many genetic loci. The novel SNPs identified here are attractive candidates for functional characterization studies that could further enrich our understanding on genetic architecture of salinity stress tolerance in rice.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was carried out under the project ‘Bioprospecting of genes and allele mining for abiotic stress tolerance’, funded by National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), Indian Council for Agricultural Research, New Delhi.

This map can be used for molecular marker-assisted selection in cotton.1. IntroductionAmong the four cultivated species (two diploids, Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium arboreum, and two allotetraploids, Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense) of cotton, upland cotton (G. hirsutum, 2n = 4x = 52, genome size ˜2.5 Gb) is widely cultivated in the world and accounts for ~95% of worldwide cotton production.1 However, the narrow genetic background of upland cotton has resulted in inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variability, and the improvement of cotton yield was slow using conventional cultivar breeding programmes. The development of molecular marker technology provides an opportunity for the construction of a genetic linkage map. A high-density genetic map creates a better platform for researching the structure of an organism's genome, for dissecting traits of interest, for fine mapping of QTLs, and for map-based cloning.2There are 19,074 publicly available SSRs (genomic SSRs and EST-SSRs), 3,541 RFLPs, 2,146 AFLPs, and 1,018 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the CottonGen database (http://www.cottongen.org/), and most of them have been used to construct interspecific and intraspecific genetic maps. However, due to the narrow genetic diversity of upland cotton, the polymorphism of molecular markers between intraspecific hybrids of upland cotton is low. To date, due to the number of markers and the genome coverage, upland cotton genetic maps are inferior to interspecific maps.3–6 The development of more polymorphic markers is thus needed.SNPs are single-base variations, including transitions, transversions, and insertions/deletions (InDels). SNPs are the most abundant type of molecular genetic markers in the genome, can be found in coding and non-coding regions,7 and are used for genetic map construction, genetic diversity analysis, QTL mapping, and marker-assisted selection breeding.8 The rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has facilitated genome-wide SNP discovery, and studies of NGS-derived SNPs have been reported in diploid and complex polyploid plants such as common bean,8 rice,9 and sorghum.10 The application of NGS-derived SNPs in cotton was rare. Byers et al.11 detected a larger number of SNPs generated from the GR-RSC libraries by using the Roche 454 pyrosequencing platform, in which 11,834 SNPs were found in 6,469 contigs between two G. hirsutum, Acala Maxxa and TX2094. As one of several methods that are based on NGS platforms to develop markers,12 restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) obtains sequences of restriction enzyme digestion tags using Illumina sequencing.13 This technology can greatly reduce the complexity of genomes, can identify abundant genetic markers quickly in an entire genome of some species with and without a reference genome, and also combines the advantages of low cost and high throughput.14 Bus et al.15 detected >20,000 SNPs and 125 InDels from >113,000 RAD clusters of Brassica napus, and about one-third of the RAD clusters were mapped on the reference sequence of Brassica rapa. The RAD-seq has been used to generate large numbers of SNPs for many species recently.15–17 This method can be applied in upland cotton to explore and develop more genetic markers to promote genome research in this species.In this study, two RAD libraries using two mapping parents of upland cotton were constructed. The objectives were to (i) develop molecular markers based on parental RAD sequencing, (ii) enrich a high-density G. hirsutum genetic map using these molecular markers, (iii) detect new QTLs associated with yield components and fibre quality traits, and (iv) assess the homology of G. hirsutum to the A2 and D5 genomes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and field trait data collectionGossypium hirsutum acc. DH962 and G. hirsutum cv. Jimian5 served as the parents of an F2 mapping population.3 This mapping population was used to screen for polymorphisms and to construct a genetic map.The traits of F2 individuals were represented by the average values of F2:3 lines.18 The traits included the number of bolls per plant (BN), seed cotton weight per boll (SCW), lint weight per boll (LW), lint percentage (LP), lint index (LI), seed index (SI), fibre length (FL, mm), fibre strength (FS, cN/tex), fibre length uniformity ratio (FU), fibre elongation (FE), and fibre micronaire (MV).2.2. RAD library preparation and sequencingFresh young leaf tissue from the two parents was used to extract the genomic DNA using a Plant Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Each of the two DNA samples was processed into RAD libraries in a manner similar to that reported by Baird et al.14 Briefly, genomic DNA was digested for 60 min at 37°C in a 50 µl reaction with 20 units (U) of EcoRI (New England Biolabs, NEB), and then the samples were heat inactivated at 65°C for 20 min. Then 2.5 µl of 100 nM P1 adapter, a modified Illumina adapter (Illumina, Inc.), was added to each sample along with 1 µl of 10 mM ATP (Promega), 1 µl of 10× NEB Buffer 4, 1 µl of 1,000 U of T4 DNA ligase (Enzymatics, Inc.), and 5 µl H2O, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were again heat inactivated for 20 min at 65°C, pooled, and randomly sheared with a Bioruptor (Diagenode) to an average size of 500 bp. Samples were then separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose, 0.5× TBE gel, and DNA fragments from 300 to 700 bp were isolated using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). End blunting enzymes (Enzymatics, Inc.) were used to polish the dsDNA ends. The samples were repurified using a MinElute column (Qiagen). Then 15 U of Exo-Klenow (Enzymatics, Inc.) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37°C to generate 3' adenine overhangs. The samples were purified, and 1 µl of 10 µM P2 adapter, a divergent modified Solexa adapter (Illumina, Inc.), was ligated to these DNA fragments at 18°C. The samples were again purified as above and eluted in 50 µl. The eluate was quantified using a Qubit fluorimeter, and 20 ng of this product was used in PCR amplification with 20 µl Phusion MasterMix (NEB), 5 µl of 10 µM modified Solexa Amplification primer mix (Illumina, Inc.), and up to 100 µl H2O. Phusion PCR settings were copied from the product guidelines, and the samples were processed for a total of 18 cycles. Samples were gel purified, and excised DNA ranged from 300 to 700 bp in size. It was diluted to 1 nM.The two RAD libraries were run on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) in Shenzhen. Illumina/Solexa protocols were followed for a 2 × 50 base paired-end (PE) sequencing run.2.3. Sequence analysis and de novo assemblyRaw reads of the two materials were filtered to remove reads with the following conditions: >2% N calls, polyA structures, adapter contamination, base (quality scores = 5) number accounts for 50% of the reads in PE libraries. A FASTX Toolkit Updated (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) was used to filter the PE reads further, and then the sequences were assembled using a Velvet sequence assembler (version 1.0.18).19 This system was with a hash length of 31 bp and a minimum contig size of 200 bp, with other parameters set to default values.CAP320 was used to identify sequences in common between the mapping parents, with the overlap length cut-off set at 80 bp and overlap percent cut-off set at 95. The resulting non-redundant data set (Gh-D-J; Gossypium hirsutum-DH962-Jimian5) included singletons from ‘DH962’ and ‘Jimian5’ and common contigs derived from both parents' assembled contigs.2.4. Sequence annotationA BLASTX search was performed against the TAIR10 protein databases (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) with an E-value cut-off of 1e-15 for the sequences of the Gh-D-J data set. The annotated sequences were assigned functions based on Arabidopsis GO SLIM (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Ontologies/Gene_Ontology/) and then mapped to higher level categories (plant GO slim) using GOSlim Viewer21 according to the three principal GO categories: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process.222.5. Mining of SSRs, InDels, and SNPs and primer designAn overall workflow of marker discovery and analysis performed in this study is shown in Fig. 1. Overall workflow of marker discovery and analysis.Overall workflow of marker discovery and analysis.The contigs of two parents were screened for SSR motifs using the microsatellite (MISA) searching tool (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/) implemented in PERL. The parameter settings were as follows: the minimum repeat unit was defined as seven repeats for dinucleotide motifs, five repeats for tri-motifs, four repeats for tetra-motifs, and three repeats for penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octa-motifs. The maximum number of interrupting bases in a compound microsatellite was set to 500.BWA (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/) was used to map the RAD sequencing reads of DH962 sample to the assembled contigs of Jimian5 and map the RAD sequencing reads of Jimian5 sample to the assembled contigs of DH962. The mapping results were transformed into bam format with SAMtool v0.1.19.23 Then the bam files were sorted, and duplicates were removed using SAMtool v0.1.19. Finally, GATK software was used to call InDels.24SOAPaligner v2.21 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapaligner.html) software was used to map the RAD sequencing reads of DH962 to the assembled contigs of Jimian5 and map the RAD sequencing reads of Jimian5 to the assembled contigs of DH962, run with a maximum mismatch of 2 bp. The mapping results, shown as RAD SE reads, were used to identify SNPs using SOAPsnp.25For all SNPs and InDels mined, sites were considered as homozygous when the minor allele frequency was below 0.10, heterozygous when the minor allele frequency was above 0.25, and unknown when the minor allele frequency was between 0.10 and 0.25.The contigs containing markers were used to design primers, employing the Primer3 program (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/). The primer length was set between 18 and 24 nucleotides with an optimum size of 20 bp; the optimum annealing temperature was 57°C; the GC content was set between 40 and 60% with an optimum GC content of 50%; and the predicted PCR products ranged from 100 to 500 bp. If the distance between two or more markers was <500 bp in a region, primers were for both ends of that region. However, the predicted PCR product was shorter than 800 bp in this study.2.6. Remove the redundancy of SSRsA total of 13 Mb of sequence data (genomic SSRs and EST-SSRs) were collected from all the SSR markers of the CottonGen database and used to assess the novelty of these SSR sequences. Among the collected markers, some were assembled by several ESTs using the Phrap program (http://www.phrap.org/index.html). Because most of the collected markers were from ESTs, and RAD sequences were genomic, it was necessary to remove the redundant sequences accurately. This was accomplished as follows: (i) the sequences between the SSR primers were extracted from RAD sequences; (ii) the SSRs in extracted sequences were shielded using RepeatMask (http://www.repeatmasker.org/) program; (iii) the remaining of sequences, which lacked SSRs, were BLAST against the collected markers; if the matched bases numbered =50, the SSR primers were considered to be redundant.2.7. Marker redundancy check between DH962 and Jimian5Among markers between DH962 and Jimian5, some were located on the same location or homologous location. We used the immediate flanking sequences (=20 bp on both sides) of Jimian5 markers to BLAST the immediate flanking sequences (=20 bp on both sides) of DH962 markers with an E-value cut-off of 1e-5 (Fig. 2). Comparative analysis of the flanking sequences of markers of DH962 and Jimian5.Comparative analysis of the flanking sequences of markers of DH962 and Jimian5.Finally, the remaining markers with primers were given the prefix HAU (indicating Huazhong Agricultural University) and synthesized by Beijing Tianyi Huiyuan Life Science and Technology, Inc. (Wuhan, China).2.8. Homology of the upland cotton to the A2 and D5 genomesFor further analysis of the homology of the two sub-genomes of upland cotton to the A2 and D5 genomes, a BLASTN search was performed against the diploid A2 genome of Gossypium arboretum and D5 genome of Gossypium raimondii (http://www.phytozome.net/cotton.php) with an E-value cut-off of 1e-10 for the sequences of primers on the upland cotton genetic map in this study.2.9. Marker genotypingIn addition to the primers developed in this study, a total of 1,869 markers were also chosen according to the criteria published by Wang26 and an interspecific BC1 genetic map from this lab.27 A total of 4,878 SSRs (3,479 HAU, 699 NAU, 700 Gh) were obtained from previous studies.28–34 PCR amplifications of primers and silver staining were performed as described by Lin et al.3 PCR products of all the primer pairs were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel3 or 8% native polyacrylamide gels using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technology.26 The SSCP technology workflow was as follows: PCR products were run on 8% native polyacrylamide gels (1:29, bis to acrylamide). The gels were exposed to electrophoresis at a constant 15 W at 25°C for 3.5–4 h. After electrophoresis, the DNA fragments were visualized by silver staining. The silver staining protocol was the same as the SSR protocol.2.10. Linkage map construction and QTL analysisA <U+03C7>2 test was performed to determine whether the genotypic frequencies at each locus deviated from the expected 1 : 2 : 1 or 3 : 1 segregation ratio in the F2 population. The polymorphic loci were integrated into the F2 linkage map using JoinMap V3.0.35 The logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold was 4.0, and the maximum recombination fraction was 0.4. Genetic map distances in centiMorgans (cM) were calculated using the Kosambi mapping function. The resulting linkage map was drawn using MapChart V2.2 software.36 Linkage groups were assigned to chromosomes on the basis of a BC1 linkage map,27 an F2 linkage map,3 and marker mapping information on the CottonGen database.QTLs were identified using Windows QTL Cartographer 2.5 (http://statgen.ncsu.edu/qtlcart/WQTLCart.htm) by composite interval mapping (CIM). The statistical significance of the LOD threshold value was determined by running a permutation procedure 1,000 times for all traits. QTL nomenclature was adapted using the method proposed by McCouch et al.373. Results3.1. RAD sequencing and de novo contig assemblyA total of 62.46 million and 61.27 million raw reads were produced from the DH962 and Jimian5 RAD libraries, respectively. After quality filtering, 5.15 and 5.18 Gb of clean reads were obtained from DH962 and Jimian5 RAD libraries, the GC contents were 34.00 and 34.17%, and the Q scores >20 were 97.84 and 97.94%, respectively.Initial de novo assembly produced ˜55.27 Mb of DH962 genome sequence distributed over 178,157 individual contigs. Contig lengths ranged from 200 to 3,195 bp with an average length of 310 bp, and the lengths of most contigs were between 200 and 800 bp. The clean reads of Jimian5 were assembled into a ˜57.06 Mb genome sequence distributed over 181,422 individual contigs. Contig lengths ranged from 200 to 2,355 bp with an average length of 316 bp, and the lengths of most contigs were between 200 and 800 bp.The Gh-D-J data set consisted of 251,816 sequences totalling ˜85.76 Mb (mean length 340 bp, Fig. 3), of which 105,264 (38.14 Mb) sequences were shared (Table 1). The repetitive elements in the sequences, Gh-D-J, were evaluated using the RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/). The relative number of repetitive elements on the contigs was 4.76%, which is similar to results from PE RAD-seq studies in other plant genomes.17,38 The major classes of repetitive DNA elements belonged to Gypsy/DIRS1 and Ty1/Copia long-terminal repeat (LTR) retroelement families and simple repeats (Fig. 4). The GC dinucleotide content for Gh-D-J was ~34.72%, which is similar to that of both Arabidopsis thaliana39and Theobroma cacao.39,40Summary statistics of the RAD tag sequencing via illumina (DH962, Jimian5)Summary statistics of the RAD tag sequencing via illumina (DH962, Jimian5)Sequence length distribution of the Gh-D-J data set.Sequence length distribution of the Gh-D-J data set.The representation of known repetitive elements in Gossypium hirsutum RAD sequences.The representation of known repetitive elements in Gossypium hirsutum RAD sequences.3.2. GO categorizationIn all, 15,535 (6.17%) sequences of the Gh-D-J data set were significantly matched to 7,719 A. thaliana genes (Supplementary Table S1). The annotated Gh-D-J sequences were further functionally classified using a plant-specific GO slim (Fig. 5). Of the Gh-D-J sequences, 41,222 GO terms were categorized under biological process, 19,406 under cellular component, and 13,899 under molecular function. Fibre development is a very important process in cotton. Then 58 contigs were identified as being related to the MYB family, 10 contigs were found to be related to expansin biosynthesis, and 27 contigs were found to be related to the ethylene response. A total of 60 contigs were related to cell wall and cellulose biogenesis, 17 of which were related to cellulose synthase (CESA) genes (16 were required in expanding primary walls, and 1 was required in the thickening of secondary walls), 11 to the cellulose synthase protein family, and 32 to cellulose synthase-like (CSL) genes.

The three GO categories are cellular component, molecular function, and biological process.The research and discovery of pest- and disease-resistant genes is also important. A total of 46 contigs were found to be related to nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domains using GO analysis, 15 contigs were found to be related to the coiled-coil (CC)-NBS-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family, 12 contigs were related to the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-NBS family, and 19 contigs were related to the TIR-NBS-LRR family.3.3. Characterization and identification of SSRs in the two RAD librariesA total of 5,158 SSRs (containing 244 compound SSRs) and 5,461 SSRs (containing 246 compound SSRs) were identified within contig sequences of DH962 and Jimian5, respectively, with an average frequency of 1/10.58 kb (Table 2). In the two RAD libraries, the most abundant type of repeat motifs was pentanucleotide repeat (Table 2). The frequencies of motif types were similar (Table 2), with AT/TA as the most frequent repeat, followed by AAAAT/ATTTT, AAT/ATT, AAAT/ATTT, AAG/CTT, and AAAAG/CTTTT in descending order (Table 2). Summary of SSRs identified from two librariesSummary of SSRs identified from two librariesAfter redundancies and duplications were removed, 1,399 non-redundant SSRs remained in both DH962 and Jimian5. These were located on the same location or homologous location. Among the 1,399 SSRs (Supplementary Table S2a), there were 67 SSRs (Supplementary Table S2b) that were different in the number of motifs between DH962 and Jimian5, which were in silico polymorphic. A comparison of the SSR sequences of DH962 and Jimian5 showed 598 (Supplementary Table S2c) non-redundant SSRs in DH962 only and 658 (Supplementary Table S2d) non-redundant SSR in Jimian5 only. Finally, 1,323 SSR primer pairs (67 + 598 + 658) were used to screen for polymorphisms (Fig. 1).3.4. Characterization and identification of InDels and SNPs in the two RAD librariesInDel calling showed there to be 3,558 InDels after mapping DH962 reads to Jimian5 assembled contigs (D/J-I) and 3,240 InDels after mapping Jimian5 reads to DH962 assembled contigs (J/D-I). The called results that conformed to any one of the conditions {MQ0 = 4 [[MQ0/(1.0 * DP)] > 0.1]; MQ < 30.0; QUAL < 50; DP < 5} were removed. After filtering, the mapping of D/J-I included 3,119 InDels, and the mapping of J/D-I included 2,869 InDels. The frequency of InDels was 1/18.46 kb. Among the 3,119 InDels of D/J-I, 1,355 were insertions and 1,764 were deletions, with the average length of the InDels being 1.4 bp (Fig. 6a). Among the 2,869 InDels of J/D-I, 1,301 were insertions, and 1,568 were deletions. The average length of the InDels was 1.3 bp (Fig. 6a). After BLAST of the flanking sequences of InDels, 1,686 InDels were found to appear only in D/J-I (Supplementary Table S3a), and 1,477 InDels appeared only in J/D-I (Supplementary Table S3b), with 675 InDels appearing in both (Supplementary Table S3c). Among the 675 sites, there were 121 sites between DH962 and Jimian5 that were homozygous and polymorphic (Supplementary Table S3d). A total of 3,838 InDel primer pairs were obtained (Fig. 1).

When screened with a coverage depth = 8, 9,048 SNPs remained in D/J-S, and 8,090 SNPs remained in J/D-S. The frequency of SNPs was 1/6.55 Kb, and the transition/transversion ratio of all the SNPs was 1.76. Of the 9,048 SNPs in D/J-S, the observed SNP transition/transversion ratio was 1.71 (Fig. 6b), and most SNPs were identified between 50 and 350 bp of the start of each contig. Of the 8,090 SNPs in J/D-S, the observed SNP transition/transversion ratio was 1.82, and most SNPs were identified between 50 and 300 bp from the start of each contig.After BLAST the flanking sequences of SNPs, 4,314 SNPs were found to appear only in D/J-S (Supplementary Table S4a), and 3,836 SNPs appeared only in J/D-S (Supplementary Table S4b), with 1,216 SNPs being found in both (Supplementary Table S4c). Of the 1,216 sites, there were 441 sites that were homozygous and polymorphic between DH962 and Jimian5 (Supplementary Table S4d). Finally, a total of 9,366 SNP primer pairs were obtained (Fig. 1).3.5. In silico mapping of the marker contigsA total of 14,433 contigs containing markers were used to analyse the distribution of the markers on the A2 and D5 genomes. We used all of the 14,433 contigs to BLAST with the sequences of the A2 and D5 genomes, and 14,103 (97.71%) contigs were matched (Fig. 7). Of the 14,103 contigs, 6,995 were matched on the 13 chromosomes of the A2 genome, and 7,108 were matched on the 13 chromosomes of the D5 genome. The hits were found in an essentially uniform distribution on every chromosome, except there were slightly fewer on the Ga2 and Ga5 of the A2 genome and on Gr3 and Gr12 of the D5 genome.

Validation of the SSR, InDel, and SNP markersAll of the 1,323 SSRs were screened for polymorphisms between DH962 and Jimian5. After being genotyped on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, 1,304 (98.56%) were amplified successfully, and 66 SSRs showed polymorphism. The remaining 1,257 SSRs were subjected to SSCP analysis on 8% native polyacrylamide gels, and 17 SSRs showed polymorphisms. A total of 83 SSRs showed polymorphisms (6.27%). Among the 67 SSRs that were polymorphic between DH962 and Jimian5 by bioinformatic analysis, 12 (17.91%) showed polymorphisms.Of the 3,838 InDels and 9,366 SNPs, 121 InDels and 441 SNPs, which were in silico polymorphic between two parents, were selected to detect polymorphisms between DH962 and Jimian5 by SSCP analysis. Thirty-one InDels (25.62%) were polymorphic and revealed 33 polymorphic loci, and 49 SNPs (11.11%) were polymorphic.The polymorphisms of the 1,323 SSRs, 121 InDels, and 441 SNPs between G. hirsutum cv. Emian22 and G. barbadense acc. 3–79, the mapping parents of our interspecific population,41 were also screened. A total of 610 SSRs (46.11%) (437 were genotyped on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and 173 were analysed by SSCP), 46 InDels (38.02%), and 127 SNPs (28.80%) were found to be polymorphic.3.7. Genetic linkage map constructionA total of 3,479 HAU, 699 NAU, and 700 Gh SSR primer pairs obtained from previous studies28–34 were screened for polymorphism in DH962 and Jimian5, and 173 (3.55%) showed polymorphisms, revealing 178 polymorphic loci. Additionally, 1,869 markers from the current interspecific BC1 genetic maps27 and Wang et al.26 were screened for polymorphism in DH962 and Jimian5, and 187 showed polymorphisms, revealing 192 polymorphic loci. Adding the 165 polymorphic loci obtained from this study and the previously published 506 loci,3 a total of 1,041 loci were used for linkage analysis. Finally, 1,013 loci were mapped on 50 linkage groups with 41 linkage groups assigned to 23 chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1). The total length of the linkage map was 3,004.71 cM, with a mean distance of 2.97 cM between adjacent markers.Among the 535 loci obtained in this study, 99 loci deviated from an expected 1 : 2 : 1 or 3 : 1 segregation ratio (P = 0.05), and 8 loci were found to not be mapped. Seven segregation distortion regions were found on four chromosomes, with many segregation distortion loci found on LG1/Chr9 or 23, LG5/Chr7, and LG6/Chr25.3.8. QTLs for yield components and fibre quality traitsFor yield components, 21 QTLs were detected and mapped on seven chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1), and explained from 9.80 to 16.62% of the phenotypic variation (PV), with LOD scores ranging from 4.22 to 7.83 (Supplementary Table S5). There were 2 QTLs for BN, 2 for SCW, 6 for LW, 5 for SI, 2 for LP, 4 for LI, and 18 were newly found QTLs (Supplementary Table S5).A total of 12 QTLs for fibre quality were distributed on six chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1), and explained 7.59–37.09% of the PV, with LOD scores ranging from 4.04 to 9.57 (Supplementary Table S5). Of the 12 QTLs, 3 QTLs were for FL, 2 QTLs for FS, 2 QTLs for FE, 5 QTLs for MV, and 9 QTLs were novel (Supplementary Table S5).3.9. Homology analysis between upland cotton and the A2 and D5 genomesThe sequences of 562 markers (the sequences of SRAPs were not available) mapped on chromosomes of the upland cotton genetic map in this study were used to BLASTN with the diploid A2 genome of G. arboretum and the D5 genome of G. raimondii, using an E-value cut-off of 1e-10. After analysis, the homology and collinearity between the AT genome and the A2 genome were high, except for Chr2 and Ga2, Chr5 and Ga10, and Chr10 and Ga9 (Fig. 8a; Supplementary Table S6a). In the current study, four unassembled scaffolds of the A2 genome were anchored by our map. HAU-DJ-S078 matched on scaffold7300, NAU2687 on scaffold3678, HAU-DJ-S168 on scaffold1365, and NBRI_HQ527767 on scaffold4507. Results showed that the homology and collinearity between the DT genome and the D5 genome were high on every chromosome (Fig. 8b; Supplementary Table S6b).

DiscussionUntil this study, there was no reference genome available for the allotetraploid cotton. The lack of genome sequences resulted in slow genome research progress in allotetraploid cotton, especially G. hirsutum. As the most important cultivated cotton, genome research of G. hirsutum is particularly urgent. In this study, the assembly produced 251,816 contigs, an amount that was too high, indicating that EcoRI restriction sites were abundant on the genome of G. hirsutum. There were more contigs for G. hirsutum than for other plants in an assembly analysis of PE RAD-seq studies.17,38,42 The sequencing depth, the assembly method, the high ploidy, and the heterozygosity of G. hirsutum, the large genome, and the high homology between the AT genome and the DT genome may all have contributed to larger numbers of assembled contigs.There are many challenges for RAD-seq read assembly. Repetitive sequences are nearly indistinguishable in the context of a short sequence read. Short overlaps are easily pieced together in whole-genome assembly, even though short reads have a high error rate.43 When assembling the reads with Velvet,19 the user should choose parameters such as hash length and expected coverage. During assembly, a median value for each parameter is chosen, and the assembly therefore is less optimal in those regions that differ from that median. Velvet can also be reconfigured to use longer hash length than the default maximum of 31, but this requires hundreds of gigabytes of memory, which is a problem for whole-genome shotgun assembly of complex genomes such as allotetraploid cotton.In this study, 10.33 Gb of clean reads of G. hirsutum were obtained from a pair of mapping parents using RAD-seq, and the GC contents of the two RAD libraries for DH962 and Jimian5 were 34.00 and 34.17%, respectively. The data sizes from the two materials were similar, and GC content was consistent with results from PE RAD-seq studies in other plant genomes.17 After identifying the sequences in common between the mapping parents using the CAP3 program20 (using the parameters of an overlap length cut-off of 80 bp and an overlap percent cut-off of 95), a Gh-D-J data set of ˜85.76 Mb was obtained. This indicated that the sequences from two genotypes represented ~3.43% of the tetraploid cotton genome. So far, comparative sequencing of such a large part of the G. hirsutum genome has not been performed in two genotypes. These genome sequences will provide significant information for the molecular breeding project and genome research of G. hirsutum.Fibre development has always been a major focus for cotton genome studies and breeders. In this study, 58 contigs were associated with the MYB family, 10 contigs with the expansin family, and 27 contigs with the ethylene response. The MYB family, expansin family, and ethylene biosynthesis are highly related to the initiation and elongation of cotton fibre cells.44,45 Another 17 contigs were found to be related to cellulose synthase (CESA) genes and 32 to cellulose synthase-like (CSL) genes. In the study by Yoo and Wendel,46CESA and CSL genes were shown to be expressed specifically during primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis of G. hirsutum. The genes found in the current study would be very useful for research of cotton fibre cell development. We also found 46 contigs that were related to NBS domains. In studies of the G. arboretum (A2) genome and the G. raimondii (D5) genome,47,48 NBS domains may be related with a Verticillium wilt resistance gene, so the discovery of NBS domains in the G. hirsutum genome is significant for research into Verticillium wilt resistance of G. hirsutum.The two plant materials, DH962 and Jimian5, had quite different characteristics in yield and fibre quality traits,3 which were suitable for mapping population establishment. To develop genetic markers efficiently, the genomes of the two parents were sequenced. The number of hits was slightly less on Ga2 and Ga5 of the A2 genome (two shorter chromosomes)48 and on Gr3 and Gr12 of the D5 genome than on other chromosomes (two shorter chromosomes)47 (Fig. 6). The markers obtained here were uniformly distributed on every chromosome, and the quality of data from the RAD-seq was high and representative. The conditions were suitable for effective marker development.Comparing the genome sequences of the two parents, a total of 17,138 SNPs were found in the two RAD libraries, and the transition/transversion ratio of all of the SNPs was 1.76. This result was consistent with other studies using RAD-seq.17,38 Byers et al.11 found 11,834 SNPs between two G. hirsutum varieties (Acala Maxxa and TX2094) from the GR-RSC libraries using the Roche 454 pyrosequencing platform. In the study by Srivastava et al.,49 a total of 1,440 expressed SSRs and 2,608 SNPs were identified from the transcriptome of two genotypes of G. hirsutum using the Roche 454 pyrosequencing platform. Because of the low levels of genetic diversity in upland cotton, there were very few polymorphisms between intraspecific strains of upland cotton. Analysis of upland cotton data involved some challenges: (i) upland cotton is an allotetraploid, which leads to the existence of lots of homologous sequences, (ii) a big complex genome structure (˜2.5 Gb), with too many repeat sequences, and (iii) lack of a reference genome. Here, 9,366 SNPs and 3,838 InDels suitable for further analysis were observed. Another 1,323 SSRs were also identified. All of the 14,527 markers were used for genome research, construction of a genetic map, and to explain the origin and evolution of cotton further. In this research, the number of detected SNPs was more than that found by Byers et al.11 and Srivastava et al.49 Until now, research related to SNP identification and genome structure in cotton has been far more superficial than in other major crops. Next-generation RAD sequencing was used here to detect SNPs in G. hirsutum. Results demonstrated that RAD-seq is an effective and economic method for SNP detection in G. hirsutum.After validation by the parents, DH962 and Jimian5, the polymorphism rate of SSRs was found to be 6.27%. In previous studies,3,6,50 polymorphism rates of SSRs were ~2.5–3.5%, and the rate of polymorphism markers from previous studies28–34 was 3.55% in the current study. In this study, markers were developed based on parental RAD-seq methodology, and the rate of polymorphism of SSRs was double that of previous studies. The rate of polymorphism of InDels and SNPs developed using the same method was 25.62 and 11.11%, respectively. These results indicated that this method of analysis could effectively and cost-effectively improve the detection of polymorphisms, and that these polymorphisms could be used as references for later marker development. In this study, 2× sequencing depth and 2 genotypes were used to develop markers. As the amount of sequencing material and depth increased, more data and more markers became available. At the same time, the limitations of bioinformatic tools and of genotyping technology can influence these results. To confirm universality and compatibility, all of the primer pairs were also screened between G. hirsutum cv. Emian22 and G. barbadense acc. 3-79, and revealed additional polymorphisms. The current approach was found to be effective with SSRs, InDels, and SNPs, and the polymorphic markers could be used to enrich the genetic map for further analysis.41 The calculated polymorphism rate in this study indicated that the application of InDels and SNPs could be more effective than SSRs in intraspecific population studies of upland cotton, and the use of markers found to be more effective in interspecific populations than in intraspecific populations. Owing to the narrow genetic base in upland cotton, the differences among upland cotton genome sequences may be mainly single-base deletions, insertions, and mutations. This phenomenon led to high polymorphism, so larger scale development of InDels and SNPs will be very informative in studying the molecular and quantitative genetics of cotton.In this study, 535 polymorphic loci were identified, and a genetic map of upland cotton containing 1,013 loci was constructed. This map was one of two maps composed of >1,000 markers in upland cotton.5 The more saturated map provided a better platform to provide insight into and to analyse the complex cotton genome. We used the new map for mapping QTLs for yield components, 21 QTLs were detected and mapped on seven chromosomes, and 12 QTLs related to fibre quality were distributed on six chromosomes. In a previous work by Lin et al.,18 nine QTLs were detected for yield traits and five for fibre quality traits. Six QTLs were found on the adjacent area of the previous study, and another eight QTLs were detected, but the LOD value was decreased. Another 27 new QTLs were detected. The QTL qFL-c10 was detected in the Lin et al.18 study and in the present study, and had a high LOD value, with >35% of the PV explained. This QTL may be a major loci controlling fibre length. Eight QTLs for LW and SI were found from 47.7 to 56.88 cM on LG17/Chr8 and explained 9.80–14.09% of the PV (Supplementary Table S5). As this region may be a hotspot for LW and SI, we will structure a permanent intraspecific population to verify the stability of these QTLs. As map density increased, the efficiency of QTL detection also increased considerably. The more saturated map can facilitate whole-genome sequencing, fine mapping of QTLs, and map-based cloning, and therefore a better understanding of cotton genome structure and improvement of cotton breeding.The current results revealed that the homology and collinearity between AT and A2 and DT and D5 were high on every chromosome except for Chr2 and Ga2, Chr5 and Ga10, and Chr10 and Ga9. In previous reports,41,51 there was considerable homology and collinearity between the DT of the allotetraploid cotton and the D5 genome. The current study is consistent with this result. In the AT genome, some exchanges occurred between Ga10 and Ga12 and this phenomenon as observed in previous studies.41,51 At the same time, some fragments of Ga13 had introgressed into Gh10, and some fragments of Ga1 and Ga5 had introgressed into Gh2. This information provides an important reference for the sequence assembly of upland cotton and helps to better understand the origin and evolution of polyploidization and genomic integration studies in cotton. Because the genome data size of A2 is double that of D5, more errors would occur during assembly. High-density genetic linkage maps are often used to anchor scaffolds or contigs generated by whole-genome sequencing to chromosomes.47,48 Chen et al.52 assigned 44 unassembled scaffolds to diploid B. rapa chromosomes using the high-density genetic map of the allotetraploid B. napus. In this study, four unassembled scaffolds were anchored by the map produced here. The high homology and collinearity on these corresponding chromosomes between the AT and A2 genomes indicated that the current results were appropriate for the refinement of A2 genome sequences. To prevent problems in the future, more markers are needed to enrich the genetic map to improve research into cotton genome structure.5.

IntroductionJapanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), one of the most desirable and highly priced marine fish species, is widely cultured along the coast of Northeast Asian countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.1 In addition to a booming Chinese market, >60,000 tons of Japanese flounder were artificially produced in Japan and Korea in 2013,2 making P. olivaceus one of the most important species in stock enhancement programs in these countries. As a result of long-term, high-intensity stocking and resource management, however, farmed Japanese flounder have depressed immune systems that enhance individual susceptibility to microbial infections.3 To increase profitability and sustainability while maintaining genetic variability in the cultured stock, the development of genetic breeding programs, such as marker- and gene-assisted selection, is urgently required. These approaches involve selection of genomic loci or genes related to the economic trait of interest using genetic maps constructed by molecular markers.4An accurate genetic linkage map is therefore foundational to genetic breeding of a species.5 To date, linkage maps have been constructed for at least 28 fish species; in addition, economically important traits have been mapped using these maps in over 13 fish species, including tilapia, rainbow trout, channel catfish, Atlantic salmon, common carp, and Asian seabass.6 Following the construction of the first generation of Japanese flounder genetic maps based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers by Coimbra et al.7 and SSRs alone by Kang et al.,8 the second generation of linkage maps has been developed with various types of molecular markers, such as SSRs and a few single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, either alone or in combination.9,10 Such efforts have resulted in the identification of several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease resistance and growth in Japanese flounder. For instance, a single major genetic locus associated with lymphocystis disease resistance has been detected11 and its candidate gene tlr2 identified,12 making the development of a lymphocystis disease-resistant strain of Japanese flounder possible by marker-assisted selection.13 In addition, four QTLs for growth rate are clustered on genetic linkage group (LG) 14, suggesting that these major loci contributing to growth trait variation are potentially useful for marker-assisted selection in future genetic breeding programs of Japanese flounder.10 Although previous genetic maps of Japanese flounder have been successfully used to map QTLs for a few economic traits, the number of commonly available markers, restricted to hundreds to a few thousand, makes it difficult to carry out fine-scale mapping to shrink the genomic regions tightly associated with important traits. A genetic map of much higher resolution is thus urgently needed for Japanese flounder.A high-resolution genetic linkage map is also an excellent tool for genome map construction, which in turn allows direct comparison of chromosomal organization and evolution.14 For instance, Caenorhabditis briggsae chromosomes reconstructed by SNP-based genetic mapping were compared with the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. An almost complete conservation of synteny was observed, with many cases of perfect 1:1 orthologues found between these two distantly related species.14 In addition, construction of a dense gene-based map of the butterfly species Bicyclus anynana enabled broad-coverage analysis of synteny with the lepidopteran reference genome; this analysis suggested strong conservation of gene assignments to chromosomes and numerous large- and small-scale chromosomal rearrangements.15 The application of genetic mapping allows genome-level analysis to be extended to non-model species, conferring an advantage in the comparative analysis of chromosomal organization and evolution.With the emergence of next-generation (massively parallel) sequencing and associated technological genotyping advancements such as reduced representation library sequencing techniques,16 SNP markers, representing the most abundant source of variation in the genome, have become widely used for high-resolution genetic map construction; they are also applied for measurement of genetic diversity and investigation of population structure.17 As a reliable, high-throughput, affordable method to reduce genomic complexity, restriction-site associated DNA tag sequencing (RAD-seq) has been particularly attractive for SNP discovery and genotyping.18 RAD-seq technology has been successfully applied in the construction of genetic maps for various species, such as stickleback,19 rainbow trout,20 eggplant,21 barley,22 chickpea,23 guppy,24 and lupin.25 Furthermore, the discovery that replicate parallel phenotypic evolution may be occurring in stickleback on a genome-wide scale26 as well as the detection of population admixture and improved identification of hybrid and non-hybridized individuals using RAD-seq20 suggest that this technique is applicable to population genomics and phylogeography.Despite the availability of two generations of genetic maps, the large-scale discovery and utilization of SNPs, the most promising markers for providing sufficiently dense genetic maps,23 has not been carried out in Japanese flounder. In the present study, we consequently performed a large-scale identification of genome-wide SNPs derived from RAD-seq of a Japanese flounder mapping population containing 2 parents and 216 offspring. We then used the results to construct a high-density (third generation) SNP-based map. We also successfully detected QTLs for Vibrio anguillarum disease resistance and their related genes in Japanese flounder. Finally, we used our SNP-based genetic map in conjunction with the P. olivaceus Genome Sequencing Project (PoGSP) database, which is to be published in the near future. In particular, the map was used to facilitate the anchoring and orienting of scaffolds generated by whole genome sequence data assembly and for chromosomal-level comparative analysis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mapping populationTwenty-four full-sib families of Japanese flounder were bred by Haiyang Yellow Sea Fisheries Co. (Yantai, China) in 2010.27 All 216 offspring of one of the families, with an average length of 12.61 ± 1.40 cm and average weight of 18.85 ± 6.28 g, were challenged through intraperitoneal injection with a 0.2-ml bacterial suspension of ~7.16 × 105 colony-forming units (CFU) of V. anguillarum. Another 20 individuals were injected with 1× phosphate-buffered saline as a control. The median lethal concentration had been determined in our laboratory previously.28 The offspring were kept in three 0.28-m3 tanks supplied with fresh seawater at 18 ± 0.5°C. This challenge experiment was performed once and lasted for ~1 week. Mortality was recorded every 3 h based on the appearance of dead fish (Supplementary Table S1). Genomic DNA was isolated from the fins of the parental fish and 216 offspring using traditional phenol–chloroform extraction in combination with RNase treatment and stored at -20°C.10 Before construction of RAD-seq libraries, all DNA samples were quantified using a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), and their concentrations were adjusted to 50 ng/µl using Tris–EDTA buffer.2.2. RAD library construction and sequencingRAD-seq libraries were constructed using a protocol adapted from Baird et al.19 Briefly, 250 ng of genomic DNA from each of 218 library individuals was digested separately with 20 units of PstI and then heat inactivated at 65°C. Various P1 adapters, each with a unique 4–8 bp molecular-identifying sequence (MID), were then ligated to designated individuals, which were then pooled in groups of 24 individuals and randomly sheared to DNA fragments. Sheared DNA was purified, eluted, and separated using gel electrophoresis, and a DNA fraction corresponding to 300–700 bp was excised and purified. After end repair, purification, and elution, dATP overhangs were added to the DNA fraction. A paired-end P2 adapter containing T overhangs was ligated to 20 µl of sheared, size-selected, P1-ligated, and pooled DNA template with a specific adapter. The ligated material was then purified, eluted, and subjected to PCR enrichment. Sequencing of the RAD products from the 218 individuals was performed on a HiSeq2000 next-generation sequencing platform. Sequencing data for each individual were then extracted according to the specific MID.2.3. SNP discovery and genotypingWe first filtered out Illumina short reads lacking sample-specific MIDs and expected restriction enzyme motifs. All the short reads from each of the samples were then clustered into tag reads on the basis of sequence similarity (allowing one mismatch at most between any two reads within each tag read cluster, with clusters having <2 or >100 reads discarded).29 Tag reads from the two parents were compared and filtered to remove monomorphic DNA sequences, leaving only the tag reads with SNPs. SNPs were selected according to the following criteria: (i) alleles with a minimum coverage of five reads and a score >20 (P > 0.05) were selected; (ii) the base at the SNP site was unique (if at a homozygous locus) or bimorphic (if at a heterozygous locus, with the minor base represented by at least three reads); and (iii) the ratio of the two kinds of bases (major to minor) at a heterozygous locus ranged from 1 to 5. Regions containing these putative SNPs were used as reference SNP regions. The clean tag reads of offspring individuals were then aligned to reference SNP regions, with genotypes of individuals determined by reference to the parental genotypes. Filtering of reads and SNP selection were performed following previously described algorithms29,30 as implemented using custom scripts (available from the authors upon request).2.4. Genetic map constructionA pseudo-testcross population was used to construct the linkage map. For the linkage analysis, RAD-based SNPs were first tested against the expected segregation ratio. Two SNP alleles heterozygous with respect to the two parents were expected to segregate in a 1:2:1 ratio, whereas a pair of SNP alleles, one heterozygous and the other homozygous, were expected to segregate in a 1:1 ratio. To construct a genetic map, markers showing significant segregation distortion (P < 0.01, <U+03C7>2 test) were removed. The remaining SNPs were then used to construct the genetic map with the recently developed software package Lep-MAP.31 The genotype data were first filtered manually to remove obvious Mendelian errors from the offspring. LG assignments were then obtained using the separate chromosomes module with a logarithm of odds (LOD) score limit of 10. The marker order was obtained using the order markers module of Lep-MAP. Because this module uses only paternally informative markers in the ordering, a second genotype data file was constructed by swapping the parents of the original data. An integrated map was constructed by using both genotype files as input, with paternal and maternal maps generated by using only one input file. To speed up the computation, constant rates for genotype errors and recombinations were used. Finally, the marker positions and error parameters were established by order markers module.2.5. QTL mapping for V. anguillarum disease resistanceQTL analyses were conducted with the WinQTLCart2.5 software program using the composite interval mapping (CIM) method.32 The CIM analysis was run using Model 6 with four parameters for forward and backward stepwise regression, a 10-cM window size, five control markers, and a 1-cM step size. The LOD threshold value was determined on the basis of 1,000 permutations at a whole genome-wide significance level of P < 0.05. The location of each QTL was determined according to its LOD peak location and surrounding region. Other QTL reference values, including phenotypic variation and a positive or negative additive effect for V. anguillarum disease resistance, were also calculated by WinQTLCart2.5. Candidate genes for V. anguillarum disease resistance were identified by mapping the corresponding tags of SNPs in QTL regions to the scaffold assembly followed by retrieval of the corresponding gene ID from the gene annotation file.2.6. Genome scaffold assembly and genome syntenyWe used the high-resolution RAD-based SNP genetic map and BLASTN (E-value < 1 × 10-5, identity =95%, and alignment rate >50%) to map reads containing SNPs with less than two mismatches to PoGSP-derived scaffolds. To reduce the complexity of scaffolds anchored to hundreds of SNP markers, a tag SNP was selected from each scaffold with multiple SNPs. The position and orientation of scaffolds were ordered and assembled onto 24 pseudo-chromosomes corresponding to the 24 LGs based on genetic distances between SNPs. Scaffolds with only one SNP marker could be anchored but not oriented because of the lack of markers. We then used the Japanese flounder reference gene set generated from the PoGSP database along with medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) gene sequences from Ensembl (release 57). After filtering short genes (coding sequence <150 bp), we chose the transcripts with the longest coding sequences to represent each gene and then identified reciprocal best-matching orthologous genes between Japanese flounder and the other fish using BLASTP (E-value = 1 × 10-10). Syntenic regions defined by the top hits of the homology search were plotted using an in-house script.3. Results3.1. RAD-seq library construction and sequencingA total of 218 RAD-seq libraries from 2 parents and their 216 offspring were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform to generate 3.91 billion raw reads. After data trimming, 3.52 billion reads, comprising ~149.87 Gb of sequencing data, were individually partitioned into RAD tags according to their MIDs. Finally, female and male parental data sets, containing respectively 22.93 million filtered reads (comprising 947.96 Mb of data with a GC% of 47.02) and 17.7 million filtered reads (comprising 796.52 Mb of data with a GC% of 47.21), were correspondingly partitioned into 6,294,857 and 4,843,594 RAD tags. From the 216 offspring, a total of 3.48 billion filtered reads (average of 16.12 million) corresponding to 148,128.63 Mb of data (average of 685.78 Mb) were produced and divided into 939,770,718 RAD tags (ranging from 1,627,621 to 8,329,563 with an average of 4,350,790) for individual SNP discovery (Supplementary Table S1).3.2. SNP discovery and genotypingAfter stringent selection according to the above-described method, RAD tags from each individual were clustered and compared. RAD tags containing SNPs of the two parents were identified using a custom k-mer matching algorithm that excluded exact sequence matches (monomorphic loci) per 41-bp sequence. A panel of 13,362 high-fidelity SNPs with fixed genotypes in both parents was identified using these criteria described under ‘Material and methods’, and alleles for each marker were assigned to their respective parental donor. Using an in-house script, these SNPs were then analysed using genotyping data across the 216 offspring and classified into three categories: maternal heterozygous (6,741 SNPs), paternal heterozygous (4,128 SNPs), and heterozygous in both (2,493 SNPs). All 13,362 SNPs and their flanking sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.3.3. High-resolution genetic map constructionA high-resolution RAD-based SNP genetic map of Japanese flounder based on a pseudo-testcross population was first constructed using Lep-MAP. A total of 12,712 segregating SNPs (95.14%) were successfully classified into 24 LGs (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The paternal map contained 8,784 SNPs with a total genetic distance of 2,561.17 cM; the length of each LG ranged from 19.53 cM (LG8) to 145.08 cM (LG19), with an average genetic length of 106.72 cM (Supplementary Fig. S1). The corresponding maternal map consisted of 6,343 SNPs representing a total length of 2,356.86 cM and ranging from 0.6 cM (LG8) to 187.33 cM (LG1) (Supplementary Fig. S2). More interestingly, LG8 was the smallest LG on both maternal (0.6 cM) and paternal maps (19.53 cM). LG8 on the maternal map contained only 3 SNPs heterozygous in both parents; on the paternal map, LG8 included 135 paternal heterozygous SNPs and 3 SNPs heterozygous in both parents. The resulting integrated map consisted of 24 LGs including 12,712 SNPs, which corresponded to 7,430 effective loci. The total map length was 3,497.29 cM, with an average inter-locus distance of 0.47 cM; the genetic length of each LG ranged from 21.64 cM (LG8) to 221.14 cM (LG20), with an average inter-locus distance of 0.37–0.75 cM. LG1 was the densest, having 495 effective loci with an average density of 0.42 cM, whereas LG8 had the least number of effective loci (only 59). On average, each LG contained 310 effective loci spanning 145.72 cM (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Locus names and SNP positions on the 24 LGs of the integrated genetic map are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

Genetic map details are given in Supplementary Table S3.3.4. Vibrio anguillarum disease resistance-associated QTLs and related genesIn total, 10 significant QTLs for V. anguillarum disease resistance were distributed on LG6, LG19, and LG21 of Japanese flounder (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Most of these QTLs were clustered together on their respective LGs. One major cluster containing six QTLs (qVA-1, qVA-2, qVA-3, qVA-4, qVA-5, and qVA-6) was detected between the narrow positions of 89.8–108.7 cM on LG6. Among them, qVA-2 located at 95.9–99.3 cM had the highest LOD value, 5, and correspondingly had the highest contribution to phenotypic variation, 8.38%. The other QTLs on LG6 were detected at positions 89.8–90.8, 100.7–102.5, 104.1–105.0, 105.0–105.4, and 107.8–108.7 cM, with LOD values of 3.0–3.6 and contributions to phenotypic variation of 5.1–7.59% (Supplementary Fig. S3). On LG21, another cluster situated within a short region (98.7–101.3 cM) consisted of three QTLs (qVA-8, qVA-9, and qVA-10) with a LOD value of 3.3–3.7 and was able to explain 6.06–6.56% of the phenotypic variation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Finally, qVA-7 containing a single SNP was centred around 115.6 cM on LG 19; it had a LOD value of 15.8 and explained 1.19% of the phenotypic variation. Although these 10 QTLs explained >59.25% of the total phenotypic variation, no major loci (explaining >20% of the total variation) were detected. The fact that these loci do not independently have higher contributions to such a complicated trait is not unexpected. Several genes related to V. anguillarum disease resistance were identified from the higher density map based on the Japanese flounder genome assembly. As shown in Supplementary Table S4, 218 genes were identified from the QTL regions, 12 of which were immune-related genes (tap1, rftn1, satb1, cd40, cd69, aicda, mtss1, ccr4, azi2, mrc1, nod1, and tgfbr2) functioning as key factors in different immune-gene signalling pathways or as antigen receptors. Interestingly, tap1 and satb1 act as molecular organizers for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I,33 while cd40 and cd69 are accessory molecules of MHC class II34 directly involved in V. anguillarum disease resistance in Japanese flounder.

Genome assembly and syntenyThe high-resolution genetic map was used in the present study for genome scaffold assembly. Among the 12,712 SNPs on the high-resolution map, 12,463 were successfully used to anchor 246 scaffolds representing 522.99 Mb to create a genome map of Japanese flounder. In total, we constructed 24 pseudo-chromosomes based on the LGs; each chromosome comprised an average of 21.79 Mb (10 scaffolds), corresponding to a mean linkage distance of 145.72 cM and suggesting a physical/genetic distance ratio of 149.53 Kb/cM. Among the LGs, LG7 holding 13 scaffolds corresponded to the largest chromosome (29.55 Mb) and represented 95.78% of the entire assembly, whereas the smallest LGs contained 8 scaffolds representing 67.85% of the assembly (16.36 Mb) (Table 1). In addition, 219 scaffolds covering 520.44 Mb were oriented by assigning multiple genetically separated markers located on each scaffold. The orientation of 27 scaffolds covering 2.55 Mb could not be determined, because only single markers were present on those scaffolds.Following genome map construction, we compared the chromosomal orders of protein-coding genes of Japanese flounder on each scaffold with their counterparts in medaka and zebrafish. A total of 6,768 1:1 best orthologues between Japanese flounder and zebrafish were identified. As shown in Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. 3, 7 of the 24 chromosomes of flounder (Po. 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 22) were in relatively conserved synteny with zebrafish chromosomes Dr. 12, 16, 3, 2, 14, 9, 24, 15, and 19 respectively. Many of the flounder chromosomes were found to have syntenic blocks with more than one chromosome of zebrafish and vice versa. An example of the multi-syntenic correspondence between zebrafish and flounder genomes is that of Po. 20, which exhibited one of the highest degrees of synteny: Po. 20 had 519 hits on zebrafish chromosomes, most of which (171, 142, and 136) were located on Dr. 05, 10, and 21, respectively. Similarly, Dr. 06 was found to be highly syntenic with Po. 01, 05, and 24, whereas Po. 01, 05, and 24 were in synteny with Dr. 11, 01, and 22, respectively. With respect to flounder–medaka genome synteny, the alignment of 6,463 orthologues on the 24 flounder chromosomes revealed an obvious syntenic relationship with the 24 corresponding chromosomes of medaka. Except for some chromosomes with minor multi-chromosome hits (<50 genes), the results of this comparison suggest that flounder is more closely related to medaka than to zebrafish (Fig. 3).

High-resolution genetic map construction using RAD-based SNPsGenetic maps constructed using molecular markers are important for genomic and genetic analyses of individual species. SNPs are particularly attractive for genetic map construction, because they represent the most common type of DNA polymorphism in the genome and are amenable to high-throughput genotyping.17 In the present study, ~950 million RAD tags were generated from 2 Japanese flounder parents and 216 offspring individuals. We discovered 13,362 novel SNPs evenly distributed throughout the entire Japanese flounder genome, providing thereby a large number of genetic variation resources for future genome selection and genome-wide association studies. Among the identified SNPs, 12,712 SNPs were successfully genotyped and assigned to 24 LGs corresponding to the 24 chromosome pairs of the Japanese flounder genome. The total length of the resulting map was 3,497.29 cM, with an average marker spacing of 0.47 cM. Four genetic maps of Japanese flounder have been previously constructed using various markers,7–10 but those maps are characterized by relatively larger genetic intervals and/or non-uniform marker distributions. The most recent genetic map10 containing 1,487 SSRs with an average interval of 1.22 cM was formerly the densest reported flatfish linkage map and worthy of acclaim. However, whole genome-level analyses such as genome-wide association studies were still not practical using this map because of the limits imposed by the types of markers and their associated genotyping methods.23 The denser SNP-based genetic map constructed in this study thus has greatly expanded application. It represents a considerable improvement over previous flounder genetic linkage maps based on SSR and AFLP markers.Most LGs on our genetic map were considered to be saturated with an even distribution of three types of SNPs, namely, maternal heterozygous, paternal heterozygous, and double heterozygous SNPs; a few LGs, such as LG8, LG9, LG11, LG18, LG19, were not, however, revealing a complex genome containing regions enriched in repeat sequences and transposable elements.35 Interestingly, LG8 encompassed the smallest genetic distance, contained only paternal and double heterozygous markers, and corresponded to the smallest physical distance (11.1 Mb). The fact that LG8 on the maternal map had only markers heterozygous in both parents whereas the group on the paternal map had only paternal heterozygous and double heterozygous markers suggests specific suppression of homologous recombination in this LG. Similar phenomena have been documented in other species having recently evolved sex chromosomes with large pseudoautosomal regions.36,37 To overcome this complication, additional markers must be developed and a larger mapping population is required to increase the density of the linkage map.The Lep-MAP program used in this study offers several advantages over JoinMap,38 currently the most popular linkage-mapping software package. Lep-MAP, unlike JoinMAP, is suitable for use with tens of thousands of markers. Furthermore, Lep-MAP is faster on large data sets, requires no manual input, and handles genotyping errors better because it estimates genotyping error rates for each marker. Since its development in 2013, Lep-MAP has thus been heavily used for genetic map construction, such as for the high-resolution genetic map of Glanville fritillary.39 Finally, the RAD-seq technique is proving to be a highly valuable tool for SNP discovery and genotyping followed by genetic map construction and has currently been applied to various species. The success of RAD-seq is owing to advances in next-generation technologies, which reduce the cost of DNA sequencing. Genotyping by sequencing is therefore expected to become increasingly popular for high-throughput genotyping, genetic map construction, and genome analysis.404.2. V. anguillarum disease resistance-related QTLs and associated genesThe generated high-resolution genetic map allowed us to perform QTL fine mapping for an economically important trait of Japanese flounder. In the present study, 10 QTLs associated with V. anguillarum disease resistance were found to be distributed on three LGs (LG6, LG19, and LG21). Interestingly, most of the QTLs were concentrated within a narrow region (cluster) on the LGs. Six QTLs were clustered together (89.8–108.7 cM) on LG6 corresponding to assembly scaffolds, scaffold196 (1.08 Mb), scaffold103 (1.06 Mb), scaffold31 (4.39 Mb), and scaffold36 (11.37 Mb), and three were found in another cluster (98.7–101.3 cM) on LG21, corresponding to scaffold190 (0.97 Mb) and scaffold70 (2.59 Mb). The quite small genetic and physical distances among QTLs in certain clusters suggest that the individual clusters are highly effective QTLs. One exception is qVA-7 on LG19. Even though it had the largest LOD value (15.8), qVA-7 contained only one SNP located in a physical gap between two scaffolds, indicating that it may be a false-positive QTL or, alternatively, the result of an error arising during genetic map construction due to segregation distortion. In addition, the smallest significant QTL (other than qVA-7) explained 5.1% of the phenotypic variation, whereas the maximum contribution was only 8.38%, reflecting the complexity of this polygenically controlled disease trait in Japanese flounder. Although the possibility exists that additional disease-controlling QTLs are present, the positive QTLs detected in this study, taken together, explained 58.06% of the total disease resistance variation, suggesting that these two QTL clusters play major roles. On the other hand, the results of our QTL analysis are not consistent with a previous report that the major QTL for V. anguillarum disease resistance is located on LG11 (LG7 in that study) in Japanese flounder.41 In the previous study, two V. anguillarum disease resistance-associated polymorphic SSR markers were selected using bulked segregant analysis and then directly anchored onto LG11. The QTLs were finally identified by genotyping of 22 SSRs of LG11 in an F1 population.41 Because the QTL detection analysis was restricted to a specific LG at the very start, other potential QTLs may have been missed. The other possible explanation for the observed discrepancy is that it was the inevitable result of using a different family under different environmental conditions, just as repeated analysis of the same family treated by two successive challenges would result in lower repeatability for QTL detection for such a complex quantitative trait.42,43 To enhance the accuracy of QTL detection, results from multiple full-sib families should be integrated in the future.To identify potential candidate genes, we compared the detected QTLs with the scaffold assembly and annotation of the Japanese flounder reference genome. A total of 12 immune-related genes were discovered, corresponding to the multi-population QTL region. The fact that four of these genes (tap1, satb1, cd40, and cd69) are associated with V. anguillarum disease resistance in Japanese flounder is unsurprising, as they are involved in the molecular function of the MHC class-dependent pathway of antigen presentation. Extensive studies have shown that MHC class I and II molecules play a pivotal role in immune defence systems, because they allow T cells to distinguish self from non-self.44 In particular, investigations of allelic polymorphism and the pattern of evolution in MHC genes in Japanese flounder have indicated an association between MHC genes and V. anguillarum disease resistance.28,45–47 These latter results also support the quality of our RAD data, because a key issue for QTL detection and associated gene analysis, given adequate genome coverage, is marker quality.4.3. Comparative genome analysisNext-generation sequencing technology has enabled generation of draft genomes for individual species as well as rapid development of comparative analyses among multiple genomes based on chromosomal-assembly levels.48 Nevertheless, the large amount of repetitive DNA sequences and high heterozygosity levels in most species, especially marine species, has hindered assembly accuracy and also prevented direct assembly into chromosomal performance.49 Consequently, a high-quality genetic map is an appropriate way to anchor scaffolds onto chromosomes. In this study, 24 pseudo-chromosomes of Japanese flounder were constructed by anchoring 246 scaffolds totaling 522.99 Mb, accounting for 95.78% of assembly sequences, using a high-resolution SNP genetic map. Such a high level of chromosomal-level genome map integrity is due to the SNPs, which were abundantly distributed across the genome by using the highest-throughput genotyping technique available.17 The constructed pseudo-chromosomes of Japanese flounder provide a basic foundation to carry out extensive comparative genomics. In the present study, we performed an in silico analysis of orthologous gene pairs, because genes are evolutionarily conserved relative to intergenic regions.50 From a general point of view, the orthologues (6,768) of flounder-medaka were more abundant than the orthologues (6,463) of flounder–zebrafish, reflecting the relatively closer phylogenetic relationship of medaka and flounder.51 Looking more closely at evolutionary relationships based on the chromosomal segments, multi-syntenic correspondences were exhibited between flounder and zebrafish, whereas almost all flounder and medaka chromosomes had a 1:1 correspondence. This difference in synteny directly reflects that the flounder have a phylogenetic closeness to medaka than to zebrafish and also suggests that a much larger number of evolutionarily significant events, such as fusion, breakage, and translocation, have occurred in the zebrafish lineage. The medaka–flounder comparative analysis uncovered little evidence of such inter-chromosomal rearrangements in the medaka lineage despite the difference in chromosome numbers among those fish species (zebrafish has 25 chromosomes, whereas flounder and medaka have 24).52–54 Furthermore, we inferred the occurrence of many intra-chromosomal events that have interrupted syntenic linkage blocks both between flounder and medaka and between flounder and zebrafish; these interruptions may have been the result of gene loss or divergence after duplication, which can contribute to deviations from synteny.55 Most teleost species have experienced three rounds of whole-genome duplication. Thousands of duplicated genes remaining after divergence of teleost species have subsequently undergone non-reciprocal loss, pseudogenization, or sub-functionalization, and may be associated with unequal microsynteny in flounder and zebrafish.56,57 From a different perspective, most chromosomal regions among the three analysed teleost species generally had a conserved syntenic relationship. This observation not only supports the marker ordering on the map but also facilitates the functional inference of genes in flounder and further benefits the analysis of genome evolution and comparative genomics.In conclusion, we used RAD-seq technology for large-scale identification of SNPs that were then successfully used for high-throughput genotyping and construction of a high-resolution genetic map of Japanese flounder. The developed genetic map is the most comprehensive genetic map to date for this species. Through SNP mapping analysis, we identified 9 positive QTLs for V. anguillarum disease resistance that will be of interest to achieve breeding goals for Japanese flounder. We also anchored the genome scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes and further identified complex syntenic relationships among flounder, medaka, and zebrafish by comparative genomic analysis. The large numbers of generated SNPs and the dense genetic map, coupled with future re-sequencing of multiple breeding families, should not only lay a foundation for chromosomal-level analysis of the flounder genome but should also provide an excellent resource for future molecular breeding efforts such as genome selection.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at http://www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was supported by grants from State 863 High-Technology R&D Project (2012AA10A408), National Nature Science Foundation of China (31461163005), JSPS RONPAKU (Dissertation PhD) Program for C.S., and Taishan Scholar Project Fund of Shandong of China.

The results presented here are expected to contribute to the progress of genomic and genetic studies of I. trifida, as well as studies of the sweet potato and the genus Ipomoea in general.1. IntroductionIpomoea is the largest genus in the family Convolvulaceae, which consists of 600–700 species.1 Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is the only species in the genus Ipomoea that is widely cultivated and consumed as a crop around the world. It has a complex genome structure, with hexaploidy (2N = 6x = 90), and a large genome size (4.8–5.3 pg/2C nucleus).2 The complex nature of the sweet potato genome has obstructed genetic studies on agronomically important characteristics such as self- and cross-incompatibility,3 and thus, the progress in genetics and genomics in this species lags far behind that in other important crop species.I. trifida (H. B. K.) G. Don., a wild relative of sweet potato distributed around the Caribbean Sea, forms a polyploidy complex ranging from diploid (2N = 2x = 30) to hexaploid (2N = 6x = 90).4I. trifida and sweet potato are closely related, because they are cross-compatible.5–7 Molecular genetic8–11 and cytogenetic12 data also support the close relationship of these two species. The discussion of polyploidization process in sweet potato is not complete; however, Shiotani and Kawase5 suggested that sweet potato is an autohexaploid derived from diploid I. trifida based on cytogenetic analysis of a series of interspecific hybrids between sweet potato and I. trifida. In addition, molecular genetic data from simple sequence repeats (SSRs), non-coding chloroplast and nuclear ITS sequences implied an autohexaploid origin of sweet potato from an ancestor it shares with I. trifida.11Because of its cross-compatibility, status as the closest wild relative, and varied polyploidy, I. trifida is considered as a model species of sweet potato and is therefore used for genetic, physiological, and cytological analyses. In particular, the self-incompatibility system has often been studied in I. trifida, with the goal of achieving random crossing in sweet potato breeding in the future.13–16 However, limited genetic and genomic resources have been developed in I. trifida. An amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based linkage map for this species was first developed by Nakayama et al.17 The nucleotide sequences available to date (November 2014) in GenBank include 1,407 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and 642 nucleotide or genome survey sequences.With the advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, de novo whole-genome sequencing is no longer limited to a few plant species: to date, the whole-genome sequences of >50 plant species have been published.18 Under these circumstances, plant scientists are further focussing on variations in genomes, with the goal of understanding the overall genome structure of a variety of germplasms with different characteristics of individual species. Whole-genome re-sequencing of multiple lines has been performed in several plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana,19 rice,20 and maize.21The accumulating information on the genome structures of plant germplasms has led to our interest in the ‘pan-genome concept’,22 which was first proposed by Tettelin et al.23 in reference to the Streptococcus agalactiae genome. The pan-genome consists of a core genome that is present in all strains, and a dispensable genome composed of partially shared and strain-specific DNA sequences. Analyses of plant genomes based on a pan-genome perspective have already been performed in a few plant species to better understand the process of evolution and to accelerate the breeding process.24,25 In addition, investigation of structural variations (SVs), defined as genomic variations in the size range above 1 kb, using the NGS technology has also become more widespread in plant genomics.26 Genome sequencing by NGS can be straightforwardly adapted to validation of SVs, especially copy number variations (CNVs) and presence–absence variations. Detection of SVs throughout the genome, along with base-level variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is expected to contribute to our understanding of phenotypic variation in species.I. trifida generally exhibits severe self-incompatibility and maintains heterozygosity within an accession. However, self-fertile lines were recently discovered by Kowyama et al.13 and Nakayama et al.17 Using one such self-fertile line, we developed a single descendant selfed line (S11), named Mx23Hm, which is the progeny of a paternal line (Mx23-4) of a population used for construction of the first linkage map in I. trifida.17 In this study, we performed de novo whole-genome sequencing for Mx23Hm using the Illumina sequencing platform. Whole-genome sequencing was also carried out for another I. trifida line, 0431-1, which exhibits heterozygosity and was used as the maternal line for the first linkage map. The independently assembled genomic sequences of both lines were classified as either ‘core candidates' (common to the two lines) or ‘line specific’. CNVs and SNPs in the two assembled sequences were also investigated to understand genome-wide variation in I. trifida. This is the first report of de novo whole-genome sequencing in the genus Ipomoea, and the results are expected to contribute to genomic and genetic analysis of I. trifida, as well as of sweet potato and the genus Ipomoea in general.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsTwo lines of diploid I. trifida, Mx23Hm and 0431-1, were subjected to genome sequencing. Mx23Hm is a single descendant selfed line (S11) derived from the self-compatible experimental line Mx23-4, which was introduced from Mexico to Japan in 1961 and deposited in the Ipomoea collection of NARO/KARC. 0431-1 is a self-incompatible experimental line obtained by crosses between several diploid I. trifida lines introduced from Mexico and Colombia in 1973 and 1980, respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) or a modified CTAB method.27 DNA quantitation and quality checks were performed using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively.Reduction of heterozygosity in the selfed descendants of Mx23-4 (S1, S7, and S10 generation) was monitored using 14 SSR markers that identified heterozygous alleles in the S1 plants. The 14 SSR markers were selected from 85 sweet potato EST-derived SSR markers developed at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (unpublished). The primer sequences of the 14 SSR markers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Genomic DNA was extracted from eight descent lines of each generation. Amplification of SSR markers was performed using a modified touchdown PCR protocol28 in 20 µl reaction mixtures containing 20 ng of DNA, 200 µM dNTPs, 1 µM of each primer, 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 1× Taq polymerase buffer. Five microlitres of each PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis on a MultiNA MCE-202 system (SHIMADZU Biotech, Tokyo).2.2. Genome sequencing and genome size estimationPaired-end (PE) and mate-pair (MP) libraries were prepared using total cellular DNA from Mx23Hm and 0431-1. The PE libraries of both lines and the MP library of Mx23Hm were constructed according to the instruction provided by Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). A modified protocol proposed by Nieuwerburgh et al.29 was employed for MP library preparation for 0431-1. The read length was 101 bases, and the expected insert size ranged from 0.3 to 20 kb (Supplementary Table S2). Sequence analyses were carried out on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.The obtained reads were subjected to quality control as follows. Bases with quality scores <10 were filtered out by PRINSEQ 0.20.4.30 Adaptor sequences in the reads were trimmed using fastx_clipper of the FASTX-Toolkit 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit). After trimming, reads including N nucleotides, or with lengths <100 bases, were excluded. The genome size of I. trifida was estimated based on the k-mer frequency of the sequence reads (k = 17) using Jellyfish ver. 2.1.1.312.3. Sequence assemblyTwo programs, SOAPdenovo2 r22332 and Platanus ver.1.2.1,33 were adopted for assembly of the Illumina PE reads. For SOAPdenovo2 r223, k-mer sizes from 41 to 95 were examined using default parameters, and the optimal k-mer size was selected from the N50 length in each k-mer size. The gaps on the scaffolds in each line were closed with the PE reads using GapCloser 1.10 (P = 31) (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html). The resultant sequences were then subjected to further scaffolding with the MP reads using SSPACE2.0 with the parameters (-k 3 -x 0).34 Potential contaminating sequences in the assembled scaffolds were detected and removed using BLASTN35 searches against the chloroplast genome sequence of potato (Solanum tuberosum; accession number: NC_008096.2), the mitochondrial sequence of A. thaliana (accession number: NC_001284.2), bacteria, fungi, and human genome sequences registered in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and vector sequences from UniVec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10 and length coverage of =10%. The resultant scaffolds longer than 300 bases in length were selected and designated ITR_r1.0 for Mx23Hm and ITRk_r1.0 for 0431-1.Assembly of the Illumina reads using Platanus was carried out for construction of the contigs and scaffolds. The gaps on the scaffolds were closed using a gap-closing program in Platanus. Authenticity of the assembled sequences was confirmed by comparing with the BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) contigs derived from haplotype S1 self-incompatibility (S-) locus of I. trifida36 registered in NCBI using a NUCmer program37 followed by a two-dimensional dot plot analysis. The accession numbers of these BAC contigs were AY448010.1 (82,054 bases), AY448011.1 (9,363 bases), AY448012.1 (31,590 bases), AY448013.1 (87,724 bases), AY448014.1 (7,191 bases), AY448015.1 (39,512 bases), and AY448016.1 (55,205 bases).36Core candidate and line-specific sequences were classified using LAST38 ver. 490 with a score of 272 corresponding to an E-value cut-off of 1E-100. Repetitive sequences were detected using RepeatScount 1.0.539 and RepeatMasker 3.30 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) as described by Hirakawa et al.40 SSR motifs were identified using the SciRoKo software41 in the ‘MISA’ mode with default parameters. The minimum numbers of SSR repeats for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotides adopted for identification were 14, 7, 5, 4, 4, and 4, respectively.2.4. Gene prediction and annotationTransfer RNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.2342 with default parameters, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were predicted by BLAST searches with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10. The A. thaliana 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (accession number: X52320.1) and 18S rRNA (accession number: X16077.1) were used as query sequences.Protein-encoding sequences in the assembled genomic sequences were predicted by Augustus 2.743 and geneid44 programs using the A. thaliana training set under the default parameters. The training set of tomato genes provided by Augustus 2.7 was also examined for comparison. Reciprocal best-hit analysis was performed to compare the results of the prediction by using A. thaliana and tomato training sets. Genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were detected by BLASTP searches against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with an E-value cut-off of 1E-10, and InterProScan45 searches against the InterPro database46 with an E-value cut-off of 1.0.The putative genes of I. trifida were clustered by using the CD-hit program47 with the unigene sets of potato (http://potato.plantbiology.msu.edu/index.shtml) (S. tuberosum, PGSC DM v3.4, 56,218 genes), cassava (http://www.phytozome.net/cassava.php) (Manihot esculenta, v4.1, 34,151 genes), and A. thaliana (http://www.arabidopsis.org) (TAIR10, 35,386 genes) with the parameters c = 0.4 and aS = 0.4. Genes in the plant species described above were classified into the plant gene ontology (GO) slim categories,48 and the ‘euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups' (KOG) categories49 and then mapped onto the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) reference pathways50 as described by Hirakawa et al.39 Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences was performed for starch synthase homologues predicted in ITR_r1.0 using ClustalX,51 and a genetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining algorithm of MEGA6.522.5. SNP discovery and CNVs analysisThe trimmed PE reads for Mx23Hm and 0431-1 described above were independently mapped onto ITR_r1.0 using Bowtie 2 2.2.34 (parameter maxins = 1000).53 To eliminate possible alignment errors, the results with the following SAM Flags were employed: 83, 99, 147, and 163 for PE reads that were mapped on the same contig with correct read orientation and insert size, and 65, 81, 97, 113, 129, 145, 161, and 177 for PE reads that were mapped on unique positions of different contigs.SNP candidates were called using samtools mpileup ver. 11.19 (parameters: -Duf -d 1000000),54 followed by filtration using VCFtools ver. 1.1.1955 and in-house Perl scripts according to the following criteria: (i) Bases at the SNP loci in Mx23Hm should exactly match the bases of ITR_r1.0 (to avoid false-positive SNP detection caused by sequencing or assembling error); (ii) all non-insertion or deletion mutations should not be included; (iii) quality scores of the SNP sites should be >200; and (iv) SNPs should not be located in repetitive sequences. SNP effects on the functions of putative genes in ITR_r1.0 were predicted using SnpEff ver. 4.0e (parameters: -no-downstream, -no-upstream).56 The I. trifida database for SNP annotation in SnpEff was constructed using the gff file generated by Augustus 3.0.2. CNVs were analysed using CNV-seq ver. 0.2.7 (parameters: -genome-size 239146348).573. Results3.1. Establishment of a selfed line, Mx23HmMx23-4, the parental line of Mx23Hm, exhibited less heterozygosity than 0431-1 in a previous study of linkage map construction.17 To obtain a highly homozygous descendant of Mx23-4, we performed successive selfing by the single seed descent method until generation S11. No heterozygous alleles were observed in any of the S7 and S10 descendants at 14 SSR loci that exhibited polymorphism in S1 generation (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Significant differences were not observed among the various generations in regard to morphology or fertility, except slightly smaller corolla size and seed weight in generations S7–S10 (data not shown). One of the S11 descendants was named Mx23Hm and subjected to genome sequencing, along with the heterozygous line 0431-1.3.2. Genome sequencing and genome size estimationThe total numbers of Illumina reads obtained from Mx23Hm was 1,322,328,000, while that from 0431-1 was 2,698,276,042 (Supplementary Table S2). After trimming, 9–11% of PE reads and 38–45% of MP reads were excluded from further analysis. The total lengths of trimmed PE and MP reads in Mx23Hm were 64.5 and 33.9 Gb, respectively, and those in 0431-1 were 80.3 and 108.9 Gb, respectively.Distributions of the number of distinct k-mers (k = 17) with the given multiplicity values reflected differences in heterozygosity between the two lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). One large and one very small peak were observed in Mx23Hm; the large peak with multiplicity of 105 was employed for genome size estimation. In contrast, two distinct peaks were observed in 0431-1; the higher peak with multiplicity of 62 was considered to represent heterozygous sequences, and the lower peak with multiplicity of 125 was employed for genome size estimation. The estimated genome sizes were 515.8 Mb (Mx23Hm) and 539.9 Mb (0431-1).3.3. Assembly of the Mx23Hm and 0431-1 genomesAssembly of the Illumina reads described in the Section 3.2 was carried out using the two computer programs based on different algorithms, SOAPdenovo2 r223 and Platanus ver. 1.2.1, as described in Materials and Methods. The results are summarized in Supplementary Table S3. The total lengths of the assembled sequences generated by SOAPdenovo2 r223 were longer than those generated by Platanus after gap closing (columns G, K versus O, S in Supplementary Table S3) and were closer to the estimated genome sizes described above (columns G, K, O and S in Supplementary Table S3). Considering that the purpose of this study is to survey as much genomic regions as possible to assign core candidates and line-specific sequences in the I. trifida genome, SOAPdenovo2 r223 was chosen for the following analyses.The Mx23Hm PE reads, which had a total length of 64.5 Gb, were assembled by using SOAPdenovo2 r223 and GapCloser 1.10. The 740,762 generated scaffolds were subjected to further scaffolding by using SSPACE2.0 with the MP reads having expected insert sizes of 3 and 10 kb, followed by the exclusion of contaminated DNA sequences such as those derived from bacterial, fungal, and human genomes. The resultant number of scaffolds was 559,634, totalling 584.7 Mb in length. The sequences shorter than 300 bases were considered insignificant, because they were likely to be derived from repetitive or low-quality sequences, and therefore, such sequences were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 77,400 sequences were designated as ITR_r1.0, the total length of which was 512,990,885 bases, including 175,412,753 Ns. The GC% and N50 length were 35.6% and 42,586 bases, respectively (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). Statistics of the assembled genome sequences for Mx23Hm and 0431-1Statistics of the assembled genome sequences for Mx23Hm and 0431-1In 0431-1, a total of 1,578,945 scaffolds generated by the assembly of 80.3 Gb PE reads were subjected to further scaffolding with MP reads, generating 1,578,945 scaffolds (Supplementary Table S3). After the removal of contaminated sequences and sequences shorter than 300 bases, a total of 181,194 sequences comprising 712,155,587 bases with 228,286,152 Ns were finally obtained, which were collectively designated as ITRk_r1.0 (Table 1). The GC% and N50 length were 36.0% and 36,283 bases, respectively.The assembled sequences were then classified into ‘core candidates' and ‘line-specific’ sequences using the LAST program. The total lengths of core candidates were 239.6 Mb (Mx23Hm) and 353.5 Mb (0431-1), whereas those of line-specific sequences were 273.4 Mb (Mx23Hm) and 358.6 Mb (0431-1) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4). In both assembled sequences, most of the N bases were classified as line-specific sequences: the N% of Mx23Hm and 0431-1 was 64.2 and 63.6%, respectively. Total lengths of core candidates and line-specific sequences of ITR_r1.0 (Mx23Hm) and ITRk_r1.0 (0431-1).Total lengths of core candidates and line-specific sequences of ITR_r1.0 (Mx23Hm) and ITRk_r1.0 (0431-1).Authenticity of the assembled genomic sequences was examined by comparison with the registered BAC contig sequences in NCBI derived from the genome of I. trifida. Six out of seven BAC contigs tested showed sequence similarity to the assembled Mx23Hm and 0431-1 genomic sequences (Supplementary Fig. S3). Despite some inconsistency possibly due to improper assembly or structural changes of the genomes among varieties, long stretches of linear dot plots were observed for these regions, indicating high degree of reliability of the assembled sequences. Multiple linear plots were often observed in 0431-1, which may reflect higher heterozygosity of the genome of this line.3.4. Repetitive sequencesThe total lengths of repetitive sequences were 142.7 Mb (Mx23Hm) and 230.8 Mb (0431-1) (Supplementary Table S5). Unique repeats were abundant in both genomes, constituting 76.0% (Mx23Hm) and 78.9% (0431-1) of all repeats. Of the known types of repeats, Class I LTR elements were observed most frequently, followed by low-complexity repeats. Percentages of the repetitive in the assembled sequences (excluding N) sequences accounted for 27.7 and 30.9% of the core candidate, and 80.6 and 96.9% of the line-specific sequences in Mx23Hm and 0431-1, respectively. The repeat masked sequences of the assembled genomic sequences were constructed and designated as ITR_r1.0_masked (Mx23Hm) and ITRk_r1.0_masked (0431-1). The numbers of total bases (A, T, G, and C) of the constructed repeat masked sequences were 192,898,192 bases (Mx23Hm) and 254,160,527 bases (0431-1, Supplementary Table S6). The numbers of total bases in core candidates were 155,039,354 bases (Mx23Hm) and 205,173,148 bases, while those in line specific were 37,858,838 bases (Mx23Hm) and 48,987,379 bases (0431-1).The total numbers of SSRs identified in the assembled genome sequences were 108,397 (Mx23Hm) and 95,138 (0431-1) (Supplementary Table S7). The average frequency of SSRs was 20.9/100 kb in Mx23Hm, while that in 0431-1 was 13.1/100 kb. SSRs were more frequently observed in introns than in exons. Di-nucleotide motifs were more frequently observed than tri-nucleotide motifs in Mx23Hm (54,631 di-nucleotides and 34,619 tri-nucleotides), whereas a small difference was observed in the numbers of di- and tri-nucleotide motifs in 0431-1 (36,941 di-nucleotide and 35,489 tri-nucleotide).3.5. RNA-encoding genesA total of 2,089 and 3,168 putative genes for transfer RNAs (tRNAs) were identified in the assembled genomic sequences of Mx23Hm and 0431-1, respectively (Supplementary Table S8). Larger numbers of tRNA-encoding genes were identified in the core candidate sequences (1,335 in Mx23Hm and 2,006 in 0431-1) than in the line-specific sequences (754 in Mx23Hm and 1,162 in 0431-1). The total numbers of partial rRNA-encoding genes predicted in Mx23Hm and 0431-1 were 476 (5.8S: 12; 18S: 223; and 25S: 241) and 299 (5.8S: 16; 18S: 148; and 25S: 135), respectively (Supplementary Table S9). The numbers of rRNA-encoding genes identified in the core candidates (65 in Mx23Hm and 76 in 0431-1) were less than those in line-specific sequences (411 in Mx23Hm and 223 in 0431-1).3.6. Prediction of protein-encoding genes and annotationTwo computer programs, Augustus and geneid, and two gene training sets, one derived from A. thaliana and the other from tomato, were used for de novo gene prediction. Augustus predicted 62,403 protein-encoding genes in the assembled genomic sequences of Mx23Hm using the A. thaliana training set, while geneid predicted 104,524 genes with the same training set (Supplementary Table S10). If only genes capable of encoding proteins of equal to or longer than 100 amino acid residues were taken into account, however, Augustus and geneid predicted similar number of genes, 50,689 and 50,515, respectively. When these two gene sets were compared, 26,364 genes (52.1% of the total predicted genes) were common to the both programs, and 1,274 (2.5%) and 1,956 (3.9%) genes were specific to Augustus and geneid, respectively, indicating that the two programs predicted similar sets of genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). Gene prediction by Augustus using the two different gene training sets resulted in generation of similar number of genes, 62,403 (A. thaliana) and 59,182 (tomato) (Supplementary Table S11). Putting these results together, we adopted the gene sets predicted by Augustus using the A. thaliana training set for further analyses.An N50 length of the 62,403 protein-encoding genes predicted in Mx23Hm was 1,536 bases, and totalled 62,468,431 bases in length (Supplementary Table S12). A larger number of genes (109,449) was predicted in 0431-1 with a total length of 82,228,566 bases, and an N50 length was 1,230 bases. The predicted genes were classified as intrinsic genes or TEs (Supplementary Table S13); the percentages of intrinsic and partial genes (76%) and TEs (18–19%) were almost identical between the two assembled genomic sequences. The ratio of full-length intrinsic genes was higher in Mx23Hm, reflecting the higher quality of the assembled sequences. The numbers of the sum of intrinsic and partial genes were 47,511 with a total length of 44,591,152 bases for Mx23Hm, while that for 0431-1 was 83,366 with a total length of 58,192,632 bases (Supplementary Table S12). Sets of intrinsic and partial genes were designated as ITR_r1.0_cds_ip (Mx23Hm) and ITRk_r1.0_cds_ip (0431-1). The total numbers of predicted genes in core candidate and line-specific sequences were 11,823 and 50,580, respectively, in Mx23Hm, and 28,831 and 80,618, respectively, in 0431-1 (Supplementary Table S12). The percentages of intrinsic and partial genes in core candidate sequences (82–83%) were slightly higher than that in line-specific sequences (74–75%) (Supplementary Table S13).The intrinsic and partial genes were subjected to clustering with a total of 57,354 predicted genes containing 35,386 genes in A. thaliana as a dicot model and 56,218 genes in potato and 34,151 genes in cassava as tuber crops by similarity searches using the CD-hit program. Of the putative I. trifida genes, 15,184 (Mx23Hm) and 26,243 (0431-1) could be clustered with predicted genes identified in other species, whereas the remaining 5,849 (Mx23Hm) and 15,020 (0431-1) were not clustered and therefore considered as I. trifida-specific genes (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables S14 and S15).

The black and white numbers in parenthesis represent the numbers of non-clustered sequences and sequences clustered with other species, respectively. The green, purple, orange, aqua, and red numbers in parenthesis represent the total numbers of putative genes subjected to clustering.The intrinsic genes were classified based on GO slim analysis together with those of A. thaliana, potato, and cassava. The numbers of genes classified into the molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC), and biological process (BP) categories are summarized in Supplementary Fig. S5. In parallel, a total of 28,208 (Mx23Hm) and 49,610 (0431-1) putative genes were classified into KOG functional categories along with the predicted genes of A. thaliana (33,630 genes), potato (41,952 genes), and cassava (31,668 genes) (Supplementary Fig. S6). In the ‘Metabolism’ category, the number of classified genes in 0431-1 was higher than that in Mx23Hm.Mapping of the genes for intrinsic proteins in I. trifida onto the KEGG metabolic pathways was carried out along with mapping of the genes in other plant species, including A. thaliana (13,154 genes), potato (14,318 genes), and cassava (14,251 genes). In the pathways categorized ‘1. Metabolism’ in the KEGG database, a total of 2,794 (Mx23Hm) and 2,444 (0431-1) putative genes were mapped onto 1,750 and 1,547 enzymes listed in the KEGG GENES database, which were involved in 138 and 137 metabolic pathways, respectively (Supplementary Table S16). The pathways present only in Mx23Hm in I. trifida were ‘mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis' and ‘non-ribosomal peptide structures', whereas ‘biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids' was present only in 0431-1.3.7. Genes involved in starch biosynthesisStarch biosynthesis is catalyzed by several enzymes including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthase (SS), branching enzyme (BE), and isoamylase (ISA). Similarity searches and phylogenetic analyses of genes encoding these enzymes in ITR_r1.0 (Mx23Hm) identified several potential homologues, which are summarized in Supplementary Table S17. For AGPase, seven and three homologues potentially encoding the large and the small subunits, respectively, were detected in Mx23Hm. Two homologues for the large subunit were located at the ends of scaffolds and were likely to be partial. For SS, nine putative homologues were found in Mx23Hm. Phylogenetic analysis using the known isoforms of plant SS suggested that Itr_sc000002.1_g00061.1 and Itr_sc000727.1_g00009.1 are homologues of the genes for soluble starch synthase II (SS II) (Supplementary Fig. S7). For BE and ISA, three homologues of each were detected in Mx23Hm.3.8. SNP discovery and CNV analysisOf the 596 M (Mx23Hm) and 484 M (0431-1) trimmed PE reads, 88.8 and 65.7%, respectively, were successfully mapped onto the assembled genome of Mx23Hm (ITR_r1.0). The mean depth of the mapped reads was 103.2 in Mx23Hm, covering 66.1% of the assembled genome, while the read depth in 0431-1 was 62.0, covering 60.8% of the assembled genome. Inspection of the sequence alignments in both lines detected a total of 7,970,056 variant candidates among the two lines. Of these candidates, 5,086,488 loci were selected according to Criteria 1 and 2 in the Materials and Methods. Further selection by application of Criterion 3 resulted in 2,089,076 candidates as a high-quality SNP set. Finally, 1,464,173 loci, including 596,211 heterozygotes and 867,962 homozygotes, were selected as highly confident SNP candidates by removing the repetitive sequences (Criterion 4). The SNP density was 1 SNP/231 bases in ITR_r1.0 (Ns were excluded), and the transition/transversion ratio was 1.45 (865,368 transitions and 598,805 transversions).The effects of SNPs on gene functions were predicted using SnpEff, which groups SNPs into four categories (high-impact, moderate, modifier, and low) based on the positions of SNPs in the genome sequences. Among the 1,464,173 SNP candidates, 3,894 (0.3%) were classified as high-impact SNPs, including ‘splice acceptor and donor variants', ‘loss of the start codon’, or ‘gain/loss of the stop codon’. Another 137,786 loci (9.4%) were classified as ‘moderate effects' (missense variants), 1,037,197 (70.8%) as ‘modifiers' (e.g. variants in intergenic regions and intron), and 257,795 (17.6%) as ‘low-impact’ (e.g. synonymous variants) (Supplementary Fig. S8). The remaining 27,501 loci (1.9%) were not assigned to any categories.CNVs in the genomes of Mx23Hm and 0431-1 were detected using the CNV-seq program. CNVs between Mx23Hm and 0431-1 longer than 50 kb in length were identified on 2,095 scaffolds. The numbers of detected CNVs varied in accordance with the threshold values of the log2 ratio (log-transformed ratio of the number of mapped reads in 0431-1 to the number in Mx23Hm) and CNV sizes. For example, 54 CNVs with a mean length of 12,444 bases were identified under the stringent condition (log2 ratio >10 and CNV size >10,000 bases) (Supplementary Fig. S9). Under a more relaxed condition (i.e. log2 ratio of >1 and CNV size >1,000 bases), 16,682 CNVs with a mean length of 1,918 bases were detected. Under both stringent and relaxed conditions, the CNVs occupied 671,974 bases (0.3%) and 44,892,563 bases (18.8%), respectively, of the total length of the 2,095 contigs (239,146,348 bases). The mean absolute values of log2 ratios in the core candidate and line-specific sequences were 0.63 and 1.72, respectively, indicating that CNVs were significantly enriched in the line-specific regions relative to the core candidate regions of the genomes (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S10).

DiscussionThe genome size of I. trifida was estimated to be 515.8–539.9 Mb by analysis of the multiplicity of k-mers of the Illumina sequencing reads. This size was smaller than the predicted values of 737–814 Mb, which were based on a previous report of DNA content in the hexaploid sweet potato (4.8–5.3 pg/2C).2 The k-mer analysis also supported that 0431-1 is highly heterozygous, whereas Mx23Hm is homozygous, which is consistent with the results of polymorphic analysis using 14 SSR markers.The total length of ITR_r1.0 (513 Mb) for Mx23Hm corresponded well to the genome size estimated by multiplicity of k-mers, whereas the total length of ITRk_r1.0 (712 Mb) for 0431-1 was larger than the estimated value, probably due to unassembled heterozygous sequences. Moreover, the N50 of ITR_r1.0 was longer than that of ITRk_r1.0 despite the fact that fewer MP reads were used. These results may reflect the difficulty in sequence assembly of heterozygous genomes. The N50 value of 36.3–42.6 kb of the assembled sequences in this study is long enough to serve as a basis for a primary survey of the I. trifida genome. However, additional effort would be necessary to reduce the proportion of the N base, which currently occupies 34% (Mx23Hm) and 32% (0431-1) of the assembled genomic sequences.When the N bases were excluded from the assembled sequences, the content of the repetitive sequences was calculated to be 42.3–47.7% of the entire I. trifida genomes, which is lower than the contents in other plant species such as Lotus japonicus (56.8%),58 potato (64.2%),59 and tomato (68.3%).60 While the length of the assembled sequences of 0431-1 (712 Mb) was longer than that of Mx23Hm (513 Mb), the number of di-nucleotide SSRs of 0431-1 (36,941) was, for example, fewer than that of Mx23Hm (54,631). The distribution of numbers of repetitions indicated that the lengths of the SSRs identified in 0431-1 were shorter than those in Mx23Hm (Supplementary Fig. S11). It is likely that the shorter lengths of the scaffolds in 0431-1 hampered the success of detection of SSRs with long lengths.The assembled sequences were classified into two categories, ‘core candidate’ and ‘line-specific’ sequences. In this study, we expected to investigate the genome structures of three haplotypes of I. trifida, one from Mx23Hm and two from the highly heterozygous 0431-1, to identify sequence variations. We adopted the term ‘core candidate’ rather than ‘core’ to refer to the conserved regions in the genomes, because three haplotypes may not be sufficient. The total length of core candidate sequences in 0431-1 was longer than those in Mx23Hm. Multiple core sequences in 0431-1 corresponded to single sequences in Mx23Hm (Supplementary Fig. S12), suggesting that the longer core candidate sequences in 0431-1 reflected the high heterozygosity in the 0431-1 genome. The total lengths of line-specific sequences were 273.4 Mb in Mx23Hm and 358.7 Mb in 0431-1, and 64% of these sequences were occupied by the N bases. When these Ns were excluded from the calculation, the ratios of the line-specific sequences to the whole-genome sequences fell to 29% in Mx23Hm and 27% in 0431-1, being rich in repetitive sequences and rRNA-encoding genes (Supplementary Tables S5 and S9).A total of 62,403 and 109,449 protein-encoding genes were predicted in the assembled genomic sequences of Mx23Hm and 0431-1, respectively. It is likely that the larger number of predicted genes in 0431-1 might reflect the high heterozygosity of this line. We focussed on genes involved in starch biosynthesis, namely AGPase, BE, ISA, and SS that catalyze starch biosynthesis, because starch is a nutritionally and industrially important component in the storage roots of sweet potato. AGPase catalyzes the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to ADP-glucose, which is subsequently used by SS as a substrate for elongation of the a-1,4 glucan chain. BE and ISA play roles in amylopectin biosynthesis though the generation (BE) or degradation (ISA) of a-1,6 branches. For AGPase, a total of 10 homologues were identified in ITR_r1.0. Of these homologues, two of the large subunit were located on the ends of scaffolds and were likely to be partial. For BE and ISA, three homologues of each were detected in ITR_r1.0. These include the sequences for isoforms that have not been reported from sweet potato so far. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that two homologues (Itr_sc000002.1_g00061.1 and Itr_sc000727.1_g00009.1) of SSII genes are present in I. trifida, in contrast to potato and Arabidopsis, in which only a single SSII gene is present. Of these, Itr_sc000727.1_g00009.1 is likely to be an orthologue of the previously identified SSII gene of sweet potato.61 In addition, a highly similar sequence of Itr_sc000002.1_g00061.1 was found in the NCBI Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) of sweet potato, suggesting the presence of an orthologue in the sweet potato genome. The three SSII isoforms in rice have different tissue specificity.62 Therefore, it is possible that the two homologues of SSII in I. trifida and sweet potato have distinct functions in different tissues.Genomic variation can be surveyed by SNP and CNV analyses. Among three haplotypes in the two assembled genomes, we discovered a total of 1,464,173 SNP candidates. Of these SNPs, 596,211 were heterozygotes while 867,962 were homozygotes in the 0431-1 genome, suggesting that 59.3% (867,962/1,464,173) of SNP alleles were homozygotes in the heterozygous line. When the Ns were excluded from the estimation, the mean frequencies of SNPs between the two assembled genomes were 1 SNP per 231 bases (Mx23Hm) and 331 bases (0431-1). Of these SNPs, 3,894 were predicted to have high impacts on gene function. In particular, one, two, and one high-impact SNPs were predicted in the putative genes encoding AGPase, SS, and BE, respectively (Supplementary Table S17). CNVs were discovered in from 0.3 to 18.8% of the genome regions, depending on the different thresholds. Though the number of CNVs was less than that of SNPs, the discovered CNVs may have greater potential to disrupt gene functions due to gene deletions, frame-shift mutations, and alternating gene expressions.This is the first report of a whole-genome survey for a plant belonging to the genus Ipomoea. Within this genus, sweet potato is the most important species in terms of industrial applicability. However, genome analysis of this species has been hindered by its hexaploid characteristics. The sequence information of the diploid genome would therefore be a useful resource for investigation of the genomes of related polyploid species. Whole-genome sequences of the closest wild relatives have been performed prior to genomic characterization of several important polyploid crop species such as cotton,63 banana,64 and strawberry.65 These studies suggested that the construction of pseudomolecules along individual chromosomes of the diploid genomes would be necessary to fully utilize the obtained information. For this purpose, development of high-density linkage maps of the I. trifida genome is the next crucial step.5.

The successful localization of weeping trait strongly indicates that the high-density map constructed using SLAF markers is a worthy reference for mapping important traits for woody plants.1. IntroductionHigh-density linkage maps are exceptionally valuable tools in many genetic and genomic applications, especially for fine-scale mapping and map-based cloning of trait-controlled genes. A key prerequisite for constructing a high-density linkage map is the availability of plenty genetic markers, which has been feasible due to the advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for large-scale marker discovery.Reduced representation genome sequencing (RRGS) is a rapid and cost-effective strategy for massive SNP discovery and genotyping.1–4 Various methods of RRGS have been developed along with the spread of NGS technology.5–8 SLAF-seq is a recently developed approach based on RRGS and high-throughput pair-end sequencing. It has been applied in many species for genetic map construction.9–11 With barcode multiplexed sequencing, large populations with massive loci can be genotyped simultaneously. Besides, a pre-designed scheme can optimize marker efficiency, and stringent genotyping procedure can ensure the accuracy of genotypes.Mei (Japanese apricot) is a popular ornamental plant widely cultivated in the entire East Asia and, as an important member of genus Prunus, plays a pivotal role in systematic studies of the Rosaceae.12 It owned many prominent ornamental features, such as colourful corollas, pleasant fragrance and weeping habit.13 Weeping trees characterized by soft, pendant branches are used worldwide as landscape plants due to their graceful and intriguing forms. Meanwhile, being a specific tree architecture, weeping trait has received increasing attention during the past years.14–16 In the peach, a set of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were developed in an F2 population, and the Pl was located preliminarily on the second linkage group at comparatively large distances (11.4 and 17.2 cM) between two RAPD markers.17 Subsequently, the simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker CPPCT029 was found to co-segregate with Pl in peach.18 However, RAPD markers are difficult to transfer to other mapping population. Besides, the located region of Pl was just an estimate and no candidate genes had been detected.In the current study, a high-density linkage map of mei was constructed by applying SLAF-seq method and HighMap linkage mapping strategy for the first time. To test the utility of this map, fine-scale mapping of weeping trait was conducted. Gene annotation results suggest the accuracy of the localization. It is for the first time that weeping trait was fine-mapped, which gives a typical example for further QTL fine mapping of important traits in perennial woody plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mapping populationThe pedigree used for QTL mapping was generated by the female ‘LiuBan’ (upright type) from QingDao, China (36.20169°N, 120.4162°E) and the male ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’ (weeping type) from WuHan, China (30.54526°N, 114.39511°E), which were selected based on their phenotypic divergence in tree architecture, flower shape and colourful corollas (Supplementary Fig. S1). In spring 2013, a clonally replicated plantation of this entire pedigree was established in a randomized complete block design with three replicates and two tree plots at Hangzhou, China (30.566389°N, 119.879582°E).2.2. SLAF library construction and high-throughput sequencingAn improved SLAF-seq strategy was utilized in our experiment. Firstly, reference genome of mei was used to design marker discovery experiments by simulating in silico the number of markers produced by different enzymes. Next, a SLAF pilot experiment was performed, and the SLAF library was conducted in accordance using the pre-designed scheme. For the mei F1 population, two enzymes (HaeIII and Hpy166II, New England Biolabs, NEB, USA) were used to digest the genomic DNA. A single nucleotide (A) overhang was added subsequently to the digested fragments using Klenow Fragment (3' <U+2192> 5' exo-) (NEB) and dATP at 37°C. Duplex tag-labelled sequencing adapters (PAGE-purified, Life Technologies, USA) were then ligated to the A-tailed fragments using T4 DNA ligase. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using diluted restriction-ligation DNA samples, dNTP, Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and PCR primers (Forward primer: 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA-3', reverse primer: 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACG-3') (PAGE-purified, Life Technologies). PCR products were then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and pooled. Pooled samples were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments ranging from 214 to 294 base pairs (with indexes and adaptors) in size were excised and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gel-purified products were then diluted. And pair-end sequencing (each end 100 bp) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.2.3. Sequence data grouping and genotypingSLAF marker identification and genotyping were performed using procedures described by Sun et al.10 Briefly, low-quality reads (quality score <20e) were filtered out and then raw reads were sorted to each progeny according to duplex barcode sequences. After the barcodes and the terminal 5-bp positions were trimmed from each high-quality reads, clean reads from the same sample were mapped onto the mei genome sequence using SOAP software.19 Sequences mapping to the same position with over 95% identity were defined as one SLAF locus.11 Allele tags of each SLAF locus were then detected according to parental reads with sequence depth >20-fold and >30% integrity in the offspring. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected according to the allele tags and SLAFs with >3 SNPs were filtered out firstly. For diploid species, one SLAF locus can contain no more than four allele tags, so SLAF loci with more than four alleles were defined as repetitive SLAFs and discarded subsequently. Only SLAFs with two to four alleles were identified as polymorphic and considered potential markers. All polymorphism SLAFs loci were genotyped with consistency in the parental and offspring SNP loci. The marker code of the polymorphic SLAFs was analysed according to the population type CP (cross pollinators), which consist of five segregation types (ab × cd, ef × eg, hk × hk, lm × ll, nn × np). The segregation type ‘abxcd’ represents that the two alleles of one marker are different in both parents.Genotype scoring was then performed using a Bayesian approach to further ensure the genotyping quality.10 Briefly, a posteriori conditional probability was calculated using the coverage of each allele and the number of SNPs. Then, genotyping quality score translated from the probability was used to select qualified markers for subsequent analysis, which was a dynamic optimization process.10 When the average genotype quality scores of all SLAF markers reached the cut-off value, we ceased this process. After that, high-quality SLAF markers for the genetic mapping were filtered by the following criteria. First, average sequence depths should be >7-fold in each progeny and >80-fold in the parents. Second, markers with >30% missing data were filtered. Third, the <U+03C7>2 test was performed to examine the segregation distortion. Markers with significant segregation distortion were initially excluded from the map construction and were then added later as accessory markers.2.4. Linkage map constructionMarker loci were partitioned primarily into linkage groups (LGs) based on their locations on mei genome. Next, the modified logarithm of odds (MLOD) scores between markers were calculated to further confirm the robustness of markers for each LGs. Markers with MLOD scores <5 were filtered prior to ordering. To ensure efficient construction of the high-density and high-quality map, a newly developed HighMap strategy was utilized to order the SLAF markers and correct genotyping errors within LGs.20 Firstly, recombinant frequencies and LOD scores were calculated by two-point analysis, which were applied to infer linkage phases. Then, enhanced gibbs sampling, spatial sampling and simulated annealing algorithms (GSS) were combined to conduct an iterative process of marker ordering.21,22 Briefly, in the first stage of the ordering procedure, SLAF markers were selected using spatial sampling. One marker was taken randomly in a priority order of pseudo-testcross, and markers with a recombination frequency smaller than a given sampling radius are excluded from the marker set. Subsequently, simulated annealing was applied to searching for the best map order. Summation of adjacent recombination fractions was calculated as illustrated by Liu et al.20 The annealing system continued until, in a number of successive steps, the newly generated map order is rejected. Blocked Gibbs sampling was employed to estimate multipoint recombination frequencies of the parents after the optimal map order of sample markers was obtained.20 The updated recombination frequencies were used to integrate the two parental maps, which optimize the map order in the next cycle of simulated annealing. Once a stable map order was obtained after 3–4 cycles, we turned to the next map building round. A subset of currently unmapped markers was selected and added to the previous sample with decreased sample radius. The mapping algorithm repeats until all the markers were mapped appropriately. The error correction strategy of SMOOTH was then conducted according to parental contribution of genotypes,23 and a k-nearest neighbor algorithm was applied to impute missing genotypes.24 Skewed markers were then added into this map by applying a multipoint method of maximum likelihood.25The sex-specific maps were constructed using markers that were heterozygous in female or male parent, while the consensus map was established by integrating the parental maps through the anchor markers (markers that were heterozygous in both parents).22 For anchor markers, map distances were calculated as the averages over the two parental distances. The remaining markers segregating in only one of the parents were placed on the consensus map by interpolation or extrapolation according to the relative position between the flanking anchor markers on the relevant parental map. Map distances were then estimated using the Kosambi mapping function.262.5. Marker-trait association analysisFirstly, QTL analysis was performed using the R/QTL package.27 A binary option was used to detect the weeping QTL. The significance thresholds were determined using 1,000 permutations. Results from the interval mapping analysis were used to construct the QTLs, and their positions were used in a default model.For the Mutmap-like strategy, high-quality SLAF markers from each individual were first divided into two pools, weeping and upright, according to the phenotypic segregation of the F1 population. To examine the relative genotype contribution from each parent, the difference in SLAF allele frequencies between the weeping and upright pools was evaluated using SNP-index-like methods28 and, hereafter, will be referred to as the SLAF-index. The difference in proportions [<U+0394>(SLAF-index)] of one genotype in the weeping pool was compared with the upright pool. The proportion of one genotype derived from the male parent (Mg) corresponding to the two parental genotypes (Ng) was defined as the SLAF-index. If the proportion of Mg in Ng was equal in the two pools, then the <U+0394>(SLAF-index) was equal to 0. A <U+0394>(SLAF-index) equal to 1 suggests that one genotype almost entirely belongs to the weeping pool, indicating that the associate SLAF markers are linked closely to the weeping trait. Accordingly, the <U+0394>(SLAF-index) was calculated for all high-quality SLAF markers between parents, which was then used as an important indicator of the relationship between marker and weeping trait.Then, the weeping trait was considered a marker (marker0), with parents' genotype being nnxnp. Accordingly, we got the genotype of each individual based on their phenotype (‘weeping’ is ‘nn’, while ‘upright’ is ‘np’). Recombination rates between marker 0 and markers of other genotypes were then calculated.2.6. Candidate gene selection and annotationWe initially detected the genes in the causal region according to the functional annotation of the mei genome (http://prunusmumegenome.bjfu.edu.cn). The gene annotation list was then screened for polymorphism at the amino acid level between the resequenced ‘LiuBan’ genome and ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’ genome (unpublished data). Genes showing at least one change at the amino acid level were considered candidates. For a more detailed functional annotation, the candidates were compared with the NR protein sequences available at UniProt database using the BLASTX algorithm, with an E-value threshold of 10-01. The associated hits were then searched for their respective Gene Ontology (GO) terms at www.geneontology.org.293. Results3.1. SLAF sequencing and genotypingBased on the results of SLAF pilot experiment, HaeIII and Hpy166II were used for SLAF libraries construction. In total, 472.66 M pair-end reads were obtained for both parents and 387 progeny, with each descendant sharing an average of 1.11 M reads. The raw data of SLAF-seq have all been deposited in NCBI SRA database under project accession PRJNA273338. Among them, the sequence depth of parents had more impact on alleles calling, since they were the basis for genotyping for each marker. The parents obtained 43.09 M reads, a rate of 9.31%, which was higher than average. A total of 230,584 SLAF loci were detected after reads clustering. The average sequence depths of these SLAFs were 35.15-fold for parents and 4.00-fold for each individual. The extreme depths of the locus-specific sequences suggested the accuracy of the SLAF marker discovery. Repetitive SLAFs were then disregarded, and polymorphic SLAFs accounted for 40.35% of all SLAFs (Table 1). All polymorphic SLAFs were then genotyped separately for both parents and all individuals. SLAF-seq data summary for mei F1 populationNo: number; SLAF: specific length amplified fragment.SLAF-seq data summary for mei F1 populationNo: number; SLAF: specific length amplified fragment.Sequencing depth alone cannot ensure the genotyping quality; thus, genotyping quality scores (details see methods) were used to select qualified markers. The worst low-quality marker was discarded during each cycle. This dynamic process was repeated until the average genotype quality score of all SLAF markers reached the cut-off value of 30. Finally, 9,412 SLAFs were defined as high-quality SLAF markers with over 80-fold parental sequence depth, over 7-fold progeny sequence depth and >70% integrity among the F1 population.3.2. High-density linkage map constructionThe 9,412 high-quality markers were distributed into eight LGs according to their locations on mei genome and the MLOD scores with other markers (at least one MLOD score >5). A total of 8,007 markers containing skewed markers (segregation and genotype sequence data are listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were used to construct the final linkage map (Fig. 1). The information of all markers on the map is organized in Supplementary Table S3, which includes marker names, LGs, genetic position and physical location in mei genome. Following linkage analysis, coverage of the markers was 155.77-fold in the male parent, 98.21-fold in the female parent and 8.18-fold in each F1 individual (on average). The integrity of each marker among the 387 F1 individuals was also a key parameter to control map quality. All markers on the map demonstrated 96% integrity (on average). The final map was 1,550.62 cM in length with an average distance of 0.195 cM between adjacent markers. As shown in Table 2, the largest LG was LG2, with 1,722 SLAF markers and a 0.15-cM marker interval, while LG6 was the smallest with 698 SLAF markers and a 0.20-cM marker interval (Supplementary Fig. S2). The uneven length of LGs is identical with the karyotypic parameters of mei chromosomes,30 and the distribution of SLAF markers on LGs is shown in Fig. 2. The largest gap was 24.13 cM in LG1, followed by 12.79 cM in LG6. 3.50% skewed markers with P < 0.05 and 4.98% with P < 0.01 have been identified on the final map. Here, we defined an area containing four skewed markers as segregation distortion regions (SDRs), and one SDR was detected in LG2, while three other SDRs were located in LG6. These SDRs may be related with preferential selection and will not affect the accuracy of the genetic map.31Basic characteristics of mei linkage groupsLG: linkage group; SDR: segregation distortion region; cM: centiMorgan.Basic characteristics of mei linkage groupsLG: linkage group; SDR: segregation distortion region; cM: centiMorgan.Numbers of each marker segregation type on the linkage map of mei.

Comparative analysis of the high-density linkage mapTo evaluate the quality of the genetic map, we firstly mapped the SLAF markers to the mei genome. An excellent collinearity between physical distances and genetic distances of all SLAF markers in eight LGs is presented in Fig. 3. All consecutive curves generated from the eight LGs indicate two facts: the mei genome was sufficiently covered with SLAF markers, and SLAF markers were placed accurately within each LG. Most parts of these curves represent a falling trend, suggesting that their genetic and physical positions follow an identical order. Meanwhile, two possible recombination hotspots can be observed intuitively on pseudo-chromosome 1 and pseudo-chromosome 4, and the relative positions in each LG can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S2.

The x-axis scales genetic distance of mei LGs accordingly, while the y-axis represents the position of mei peseudo-chromosomes. SLAF markers in these LGs are plotted as dots on the Figure.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Macro-collinearity was revealed by aligning the SLAF markers on the mei high-density map to the peach genome sequence. Using 90% identity as the standard, 6,837 SLAF markers were mapped onto the peach genome (Supplementary Fig. S3). LG1 and LG6 appeared to have adverse orientations with the peach chromosomes (Ch6 and Ch8), which were nominal since, there was no stringent direction of the markers during linkage mapping. LG5 was syntenic to two peach chromosomes, Ch2 and Ch4, suggesting that fission or translocation events have occurred between the two Prunus species.3.4. Inheritance mode of weeping trait of meiAs a prerequisite to mapping the loci responsible for weeping, the inheritance of the weeping trait was evaluated. In this study, two F1 segregation populations were obtained, of which the parents differed remarkably in tree architecture (upright cultivar × weeping cultivar). Of the 320 genotypes in the ‘LiuBanDan’ × ‘ShuangBi’ population, 143 were classified as weeping and 177 as upright. A <U+03C7>2 test indicated that the growth habit segregation fit the expected ratio of 1 : 1. In the ‘LiuBan’ × ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’ mapping population (387 individuals), the growth habits of 165 and 222 trees were ranked as weeping (W) and upright (U), respectively (Table 3). The growth habit segregation in this population was slightly distorted from the expected 1(W) : 1(U) ratio due to an excess of uprights. Meanwhile, diverse branching habit that determined different tree architecture of weeping progeny was observed. Combined with former molecular basis of weeping trait, we suggested that weeping trait of mei may be controlled by a major gene together with one or more modifiers to account for a deficiency of weeping seedlings in the ‘LiuBan’ × ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’ population. Segregation ratios of progenies with weeping and upright shape in mei F1 populationsCross combinations: LB × FT: ‘LiuBan’ × ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’; LBD × SB: ‘LiuBanDan’ × ‘ShuangBi’.Segregation ratios of progenies with weeping and upright shape in mei F1 populationsCross combinations: LB × FT: ‘LiuBan’ × ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’; LBD × SB: ‘LiuBanDan’ × ‘ShuangBi’.3.5. Fine mapping of loci conferring weeping traitFirst, QTL analysis was performed using R/qtl based on the high-density genetic map and phenotypic separation among progeny.27 Threshold of significance (P = 0.05) for each marker after 1,000 permutation was set to 4.35, which resulted in the identification of a single locus at 71.88 cM on pseudo-chromosome 7 (Fig. 4). On the linkage map, three markers (marker353041, marker437413 and marker321918) located at 71.88 cM. The LOD scores on pseudo-chromosome 7 were much higher than those on other pseudo-chromosomes, with the LOD score of the strongest QTL peak (peak LOD score = 87.65) being the highest. This phenomenon suggested that the locus on pseudo-chromosome 7 was strongly associated with weeping trait. However, the 95% confidence intervals for the QTL position were 4.80–87.65 cM, almost covered the whole pseudo-chromosome 7. To conduct finer mapping of the loci controlling weeping trait, a Mutmap-like strategy was initially applied to identify polymorphisms of the SLAF markers. Mutmap was developed on the basis of bulked segregation analysis (BSA) by calculating a parameter (SNP-index) to judge the contribution of an allele to the mutant phenotype.28 Here, we considered weeping as the mutant trait and calculated <U+0394>(SLAF-index) for each SLAF marker on the genome. The relationship between <U+0394>(SLAF-index) and SLAF position on the genome was graphically represented (Fig. 5). As expected, <U+0394>(SLAF-index) values were distributed randomly around 0 for most of the genome, with the exception of pseudo-chromosome 7. An obvious peak was observed when the <U+0394>(SLAF-index) threshold was set to 0.85. Five markers (marker334902, marker430976, marker446598, marker431969 and marker348136) above the threshold value with an average <U+0394>(SLAF-index) equal to 0.9 were considered to be tightly linked markers to the weeping trait, and ranged from 69.63 to 75.52 cM on LG7. The above results strongly suggested that a major locus controlling the weeping trait was located on pseudo-chromosome 7 of mei. Thus, we assumed that weeping trait was a completely monogenetic trait to further confirm this localization. On this basis, we considered weeping trait as a marker (marker0) and calculated the recombination rate of marker0 with other markers. Eventually, the locus conferring weeping trait was determined to be located between two markers, whose recombination rate with marker0 was the lowest in LG7. The two flanking markers were positioned at 76.83 cM (marker315769) and 82.99 cM (marker418421), respectively. R/QTL analysis of weeping trait.

In total, 10 markers were considered to be tightly linked to weeping trait. Based on the positions of the SLAF markers on the fully sequence genome of mei, the candidate genomic region for weeping trait was located at 10.54–11.68 Mb on pseudo-chromosome 7 of mei (Fig. 6A).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.6. Annotated genes within the candidate regionThe interval of the candidate region is 1.14 Mb in length and contains 159 predicted protein encoding genes. Genes within the candidate region were then detected based on annotation of the mei genome (http://prunusmumegenome.bjfu.edu.cn./). All 159 predicted genes were first screened for predicted amino acid polymorphisms between the ‘LiuBan’ and ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’ alleles according to their whole-genome resequencing data. This selection resulted in 69 genes. Among them, 19 could not be annotated using the known annotation databases. A complete list of the remaining 50 genes is provided in Supplementary Table S4.Some of the genes are conspicuous. Nine were obviously associated with tension wood (TW) formation and development, which are related with weeping trait. Two members of the cellulose synthase-like (CSL) family, Pm024150 and Pm024152, are important for cell wall development and growth.32 Pm024254 that encodes endo-beta-1,4-glucanase is believed to function in cell wall changes associated with diverse growth processes and cell elongation.33,34 Two predicted genes (Pm024195 and Pm024255) have been suggested to be involved in cell wall formation and assembly.35,36 Auxin-induced protein 5NG4-like (Pm024277), a positive regulator of auxin metabolism, may be involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis.37 Also, genes involved in lignin biosynthesis that affect fibre development may result in TW abnormalities.38 Pm024278 is a probable cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 1, which catalyzes the final specific step for lignin monomer production,39 while Pm024136 is predicted to be involved in xylan metabolism. NAC domain-containing protein 43 (Pm024277) may regulate the secondary cell wall lignification of tissues.40Weeping trait may be controlled by a regulatory gene causing differential expression of the downstream network.41 Our annotation analysis revealed nine genes that may regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level or post-transcriptional level. 26S proteasome (Pm024160) deserves close attention, since it may play an important role in balancing cell expansion with cell proliferation during shoot development.42 Twenty-one Protein NLP6 (Pm024165) is an uncharacterized transcription factor, while 22 Protein NLP7 (Pm024166) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of nitrate assimilation and nitrate signal transduction.43 BHLH155 (Pm024214) is a transcription factor that may regulate root development, while growth-regulating factor 8 (Pm024257) may act as a transcriptional activator that plays a role in the regulation of cell expansion in meristem tissues.44 Four genes (Pm024270, Pm024271, Pm024275 and Pm024123) with significant function variation in the ‘LiuBan’ and ‘FenTaiChuiZhi’ genome were predicted to be DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB1, a structure to promote translocation of Pol II, which serves as a platform for the assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing.45In addition, some genes are related to enzymatic activities. Among these genes, Pm024200 corresponds to the tightly linked marker437413 and is suggested to participate in coenzyme transport and metabolism. It has been suggested that ethylene promotes cell elongation in cotton.38 Pm024219, which encodes serine/threonine-protein kinase WNK8, and Pm024247, which encodes subtilisin-like protease (precursor), may both contribute to cell elongation, since a conformational change in the serine/threonine protein kinase activates the downstream signalling of ethylene.38 N6-adenosine-methyltransferase MT-A70-like (Pm024237), which methylates adenosine residues of some mRNAs, may also play a role in the efficiency of mRNA splicing, transport or translation.4. Discussion4.1. Characteristics of SLAF-seq strategy for large-scale marker developmentThe SLAF-seq strategy, a combination of locus-specific amplification and high-throughput sequencing, is an effective method for large-scale SNP discovery and genotyping, which has been applied successfully in various species.9–11Compared with conventional methods of marker development, the SLAF-seq method owned some unique superiority. First, since copy number uniformity among fragments can reduce bias sequencing result, a pre-designed scheme was conducted to ensure the density, uniformity and efficiency of marker development. The well-assembled reference genome of mei was analysed beforehand, considering the information on genomic GC content, repeat conditions and genetic characteristics. After that, a pilot experiment was performed to check the reduced representation library features in targeted length range (214–294 bp), which was supposed to include fragments with similar amplification features on the gel. When non-specific amplified bands appeared, the pre-design step would be repeated. SLAF markers were designed such that an even distribution throughout the genome was established and repeats were avoided. Second, sequence depth together with the genotyping quality scores enhanced the genotyping accuracy. Since lower coverage per locus always lead to a lower confidence in each genotype call and each newly discovered marker,46 sequencing depth is an important consideration in sequencing-based genotyping. It is suggested that 6-fold is a minimal sequencing depth for each individual when SLAF-seq strategy is used.10 A sequencing depth of over 80-fold for parents and over 7-fold for progenies of our study can provide sufficiently high genotyping accuracy. Sequencing depth alone cannot ensure the genotyping quality; thus, genotyping quality scores were used to detect suspicious markers. In this study, suspicious marker was discarded during each cycle of the dynamic process, until the average genotype quality score of all SLAF markers reached the cut-off value of 30. Third, successive stringent principles were used for high-quality SLAF marker selection. All these features mentioned above make the SLAF-seq strategy an effective new tool for large-scale genotyping and rapidly markers development.This study provides the first marker development on large scale for mei; in total, 9,412 high-quality SLAF markers were developed, and 8,007 polymorphic markers were finally identified for genetic linkage map construction. The integrity and accuracy of the SLAF markers were high, while the quality and quantity of them also met the requirements for construction of a high-quality and high-density genetic map. It is for the first time that SLAF-seq strategy was successfully applied in developing markers in ornamental woody plants.4.2. The densest genetic map of meiThe genetic map in this study was the first mei genetic map constructed using over 8,000 SLAF markers developed from SLAF-seq strategy. The earliest genetic map was of the Chinese mei cultivars ‘Fenban’ and ‘Kouzi’, using 144 SSR markers.47 Later, by applying the RAD-seq strategy, 779 SNP markers were developed for the same mapping population, which were then used in anchoring and orienting scaffolds for mei genome assembly.48 However, the resolutions of these maps and the sizes of the mapping populations were not enough for fine-scare QTL localization. In this study, the linkage map contained 8,007 markers, a marker density that has, to our knowledge, never been reached for mei and even any other species of Prunus.12,49 This linkage map covered nearly the whole genome with a resolution of 0.195 cM.To increase the quantity of markers and genomic coverage on the final genetic map, skewed markers were not discarded. In total, 8.5% skewed markers were inserted in the genetic map at the last step. Marker distortion may be caused by preferential selection or gametic/zygotic selection,31,50,51 which always resulted in higher genetic variance.52 It is reported that skewed markers can be applied for QTL mapping without detrimental effect and can be beneficial if used properly, as areas containing skewed markers may be recombination hotspots for specific traits.25,53Besides, a HighMap strategy (the development of HighMap software is under way) was utilized to construct the high-density genetic map in this study. By exploiting an iterative ordering and error correction strategy as well as optimized GSS algorithm, HighMap was efficient for constructing linkage maps using markers developed from NGS. First, the marker order and the map distance were relatively accurate for data with genotyping errors, since an error correction strategy was performed. Second, HighMap greatly curbed the genetic map distance, while the iterative ordering strategy ensured an accurate marker order.20 The excellent collinearity between physical distance and genetic distance of all SLAF markers in eight LGs strongly indicates the high quality of our map. Meanwhile, high macro-collinearity is also observed among the SLAF markers of our map and the peach genome, which is identical with former researches.47,48The mapping population should segregate for flower shape, corolla colour and cold tolerance, since the parents of the F1 population show obvious differences in these traits (Supplementary Fig. S1). As the mei whole-genome sequence has been released,48 it can be used in combination with our map for fine-scale mapping of genes related to important ornamental traits, since the sequences of each marker is available and genes around the marker are easy to obtain. As the species of Prunus are closely related, this high-quality and high-density genetic map will also accelerate the molecular breeding for perennial woody plants in Prunus.4.3. Location of locus conferring weeping trait utilizing the high-density mapPrevious studies have suggested that the weeping trait was controlled by a single recessive gene both in peach and mulberry.14,16,54–57 However, Tu et al. suggested that weeping trait in Castanea mollissima was controlled by a major recessive gene together with some modifier genes. Although self-cross of a weeping parent yielded 1(W) : 3(U) ratio of the progeny, different branching drooping degrees were observed among the weeping offspring.58 In terms of our mapping population, the segregation ratio was slightly distorted from the expected ratio, while no skewed markers had been detected around the flanking regions of the weeping locus. Besides, the branching drooping degree of the progeny was also diverse. The inheritance pattern of mei was similar to C. mollissima. Thus, we supposed that weeping trait of mei was controlled by a major recessive gene together with some modifier genes account for an excess of upright seedlings.Because of the complexity of tree architecture, it is difficult to define a methodology for describing branching habit in an accurate quantitative way on tree descendants. However, the distinction between the weeping and upright forms of the mei progeny was sharply clear according to their branching directions.13 Thus, the progeny were scored quantitatively according to their phenotypes, and QTL analysis was then performed to map loci conferring weeping trait. According to the confidence intervals analysis, the candidate region almost covered the whole pseudo-chromosome 7. Then a Mutmap-like strategy was performed to fine map the weeping loci. The results of the two methods both suggested that the major locus controlling weeping trait was located on mei pseudo-chromosome 7. To confirm this conclusion, an extreme linkage analysis was conducted considering weeping trait as a complete recessive monogenetic trait. And the supposed weeping gene was also located on mei pseudo-chromosome 7. The results of these three methods can be mutual authentication and supplement, which could increase the reliability of the candidate locus of weeping trait.Since the use of more highly annotated genomic databases could narrow down the selection of plausible candidate genes, it was worthwhile to determine the function of the candidate genes in the causal region. Combining the whole-genome resequencing data of the parents with the highly annotated genomic databases, we successfully narrowed down the number of plausible candidates to 69. However, due to the poor genetic background of weeping trait, it was difficult to determine the weeping controlling gene directly. Nine candidate structural genes and enzymes were predicted to be involved in cell wall and cellulose synthesis/degradation. These genes were supposed to be linked with weeping trait, since TW contains higher cellulose content and lower lignin, which may cause the drooping phenomenon.38,59 Besides, nine genes were predicted to be related to transcriptional regulation, which were preferred for further experimental verification. In total, 18 candidates were considered as the most plausible genes of weeping in the casual region (Fig. 6B). The annotation results also confirm that the localization of weeping locus is precise which suggested the high quality of our genetic map.In summary, the present study demonstrates that SLAF-seq strategy is a powerful method for marker discovery and high-density linkage map construction, and our study resulted in the densest linkage map for mei. Comparative analysis and fine-scale mapping of the weeping trait suggest the high quality of this genetic map. A locus conferring weeping trait was detected on a 1.14-Mb interval on pseudo-chromosome 7 of mei for the first time, which is important for a better understanding of genetic mechanism of weeping trait. The precise localization of weeping trait strongly indicates that the high-density genetic map should contribute to the breeding of important ornamental traits in mei, along with the genus prunus.Conflict of Interest statementThe authors declared that they have no competing interests.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant No. 2011AA100207), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (No. BLYJ201407) and Special Fund for Beijing Common Construction Project.

IntroductionChickpea is among the most important food legumes of the world. To meet the dietary protein demand of the fast increasing global population, it is vital to raise the world-wide chickpea production and seed/pod yield potential. The seed size/100-seed weight, one of the most crucial seed and pod yield-contributing trait, has always been a trait of consumer preference and trade, besides an important component of domestication and adaptation in chickpea.1,2 The enhanced productivity in chickpea can be effectively achieved by developing its high-yielding (increased seed size/weight) durable stress-tolerant improved varieties. Most of these yield-contributing (seed size/weight) and stress tolerance traits targeted for chickpea genetic enhancement are complex and quantitative in nature and governed by multiple major and/or minor genes/QTLs (quantitative trait loci). Identification and fine mapping/map-based cloning of genes underlying QTLs controlling important agronomic traits have been established as the most effective approach for quantitative dissection of these complex traits in crop plants, including chickpea. Significant efforts have been made towards identifying the QTLs associated with diverse yield component and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance traits [including flowering and maturation time, plant growth habit, plant height, seed size/100-seed weight, double podding, seed/pod number per plant and harvest index, nodulation, disease resistance (Fusarium wilt, Ascochyta blight and Botrytis gray mold), and salinity and drought tolerance (root traits)] in chickpea.3–27 However, only limited number of these QTLs alongside the QTLs regulating seed weight, nodulation, drought tolerance, and Fusarium wilt and Ascochyta blight resistance traits have been fine mapped till date and subsequently utilized for marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea.23,24,26–29 To drive the fine mapping of trait-regulating QTLs, the large-scale genotyping of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and prior discovered single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in individuals of inter-/intra-specific mapping populations employing multiple high-throughput genotyping assays are found to be fairly suitable in chickpea.30–32,24 This includes SSR markers-based genotyping assay like fluorescent dye-labelled automated fragment analyzer and array-based genotyping platforms, including Illumina GoldenGate/Infinium and Competitive Allele Specific PCR (KASPar) assays and MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) mass array for large-scale genotyping of SNP markers. However, in chickpea with low marker genetic polymorphism, these approaches demand huge cost, labour, time and resources for detecting polymorphic markers between the parents of mapping populations and also sample-by-sample low-throughput genotyping of limited number of markers in a larger set of mapping individuals. Interestingly, the fine mapping of trait-associated QTLs has now become simpler and easy to accomplish with advent of a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) assay that demonstrated its efficacy by simultaneous discovery and genotyping of SNPs in mapping individuals at a genome-wide scale.33–41 The need of extensive bioinformatics analysis and suitable computational genomics tools in SNP imputation and scanning of high-quality and non-erroneous SNP genotyping information, particularly from individuals of advanced generation mapping populations could restrain the use of GBS assay for molecular mapping of QTLs in preliminary populations of chickpea. Henceforth, efforts should be made to develop an alternative genome-wide strategy that involves less cost, time and labour for high-resolution QTL identification in chickpea.In this perspective, a high-throughput genome-wide QTL-seq strategy that employs NGS technology for whole-genome resequencing of two DNA bulks of progeny from a segregating mapping population with extremely contrasting phenotypic trait values seems quite pertinent. Since its inception, this has become the most popular approach for quick identification of high-resolution robust and major QTLs controlling qualitative and quantitative traits in crop plants.42 Quite recently, this strategy when employed in preliminary F2 and advanced generation recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations successfully identified major genes underlying QTLs associated with seedling vigour and blast resistance in rice and flowering time in cucumber.42,43 The wider applicability and added advantages of QTL-seq over other traditional QTL mapping strategies available in diverse plant species have been truly realized.42,43 Henceforth, its usage in rapid genome-wide scanning and fine mapping of major genes underlying robust QTLs in a large chickpea genome with narrow genetic base assumes relevance. This could eventually accelerate the genomics-assisted breeding as well as genetic improvement of chickpea with optimal use of resources.As a proof of concept, the present study for the first time made an effort to implement a genome-wide NGS-based high-throughput QTL-seq approach in an intra-specific (desi) F4 mapping population (ICC 7184 × ICC 15061) for identifying a major genomic region harbouring the robust QTL associated with 100-seed weight in chickpea. The QTL-seq-derived major seed weight QTL was further validated by SNP and SSR marker-based classical QTL mapping. The integration of QTL-seq and traditional QTL mapping with differential expression profiling delineated a potential candidate gene at the major QTL interval regulating seed weight in chickpea. Mining of novel allelic variants and analysis of natural allelic diversity in this seed weight-associated potential gene across diverse cultivated and wild genotypes gave deeper insight into the complex seed weight trait evolution during chickpea domestication.2. Materials and methods2.1. Phenotyping of mapping population for agronomic traitsAn intra-specific 221 F4 mapping population (ICC 7184 × ICC 15061) derived from low (desi cv. ICC 7184 with 100-seed weight 8.9 g) and high (desi cv. ICC 15061 with 30.1 g) seed weight landraces was developed by single seed descent method. The mapping individuals and parental genotypes were grown (following a-design field plot method) for three consecutive years (2010–13) with at least two replications during the crop growing season at two diverse geographical locations of India. The mapping individuals along with parental genotypes were phenotyped individually for 100-seed weight (SW). The SW (g) was estimated by considering the average weight (g) of 100-matured seeds at 10% moisture content by selecting 10–12 representative plants from each mapping individuals. The diverse statistical attributes, including coefficient of variation (CV), broad-sense heritability (H2), frequency distribution, correlation coefficient and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of SW in mapping population, were analysed using SPSS v17.0 (http://www.spss.com/statistics) and following the methods of Kujur et al.20,212.2. NGS-based whole-genome sequencing and QTL-seq analysisFor QTL-seq study, 10 of each low and high seed weight homozygous mapping individuals representing two extreme ends of SW normal frequency distribution curve were screened based on the preliminary clues obtained from our conventional QTL mapping study. The homozygous genetic constitution of these individuals for either of the low and high seed weight trait was assured in QTL mapping through their multi-location/years replicated field phenotyping as well as genotyping of genome-wide well-distributed 96 SSR markers.20,21 The high-quality genomic DNA isolated from fresh leaves of these homozygous mapping individuals was quantified (Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, Life Technologies, USA) to equal concentration. The isolated genomic DNA from 10 of each low and high seed weight homozygous mapping individuals were pooled together with an equal ratio (amount) to constitute LSB (low seed weight bulk) and HSB (high seed weight bulk), respectively. About 5–10 µg of DNA isolated from two bulked samples and two parental genotypes were used to construct pair-end sequencing libraries (100-bp read length). These libraries were sequenced individually using HiSeq2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) NGS platform. The FASTQ raw sequence reads with a minimum phred Q-score of 30 across >95% of nucleotide sequences were considered as high quality. These sequences were further rechecked for their quality using FASTQC v0.10.1. The filtered high-quality sequences obtained from two bulks and parental genotypes were aligned and mapped on to the reference desi (ICC 495844) chickpea genome using Burrows-Wheeler alignment tool (BWA) with default parameters.45 The high-quality SNPs (minimum sequence read depth: 10 with SNP base quality =20) were discovered using SAM tools46 and following the detail procedures of Lu et al.43 and Takagi et al.42A well-documented QTL-seq approach relying on the estimation of SNP-index and <U+0394> (SNP-index) (following the recommended parameters of Abe et al.47; Takagi et al.42; Lu et al.43) were used to identify candidate genomic region(s) harbouring the major QTL(s) associated with seed weight in chickpea. In our study, <U+0394> (SNP-index) was measured based on subtraction of SNP-index (proportion of sequence reads supported the SNPs which are altogether different from the reference desi genome sequences) between LSW and HSW bulks. The SNP-index was measured as ‘0’ and ‘1’, when entire short sequence reads contained genomic fragments derived from ICC 7184 and ICC 15061, respectively. An average distribution of <U+0394> (SNP-index) of SNPs physically mapped across eight desi chromosomes was estimated in a given genomic interval by using sliding window approach with 5 Mb window size and 10 kb increment. The <U+0394> (SNP-index) of LSB and HSB and their corresponding SNP-index within the specified window size were plotted in a graph to generate SNP-index plots. To improve the accuracy of QTL identification through QTL-seq, we estimated the statistical confidence intervals of <U+0394> (SNP-index) with a given read depth under the null hypothesis of no QTLs, following the detail procedures of Takagi et al.42 and Lu et al.432.3. High-throughput genotyping of SNP and SSR markers in an intra-specific mapping populationTo validate the major SW QTL identified by QTL-seq, the traditional QTL mapping by selecting the SNP and SSR markers (physically mapped on desi chromosome 1 in which major QTL was identified through QTL-seq) showing polymorphism between parental genotypes (ICC 7184 and ICC 15061) was performed. A selected 192 SNPs (physically mapped on desi chromosome 1) differentiating ICC 7184 and ICC 15061 were used for their validation and high-throughput genotyping in 192 representative mapping individuals and parental genotypes using Illumina GoldenGate assay. The custom oligo pool assay (OPA) designing, custom Sentrix Array Matrix (SAM) synthesis and GoldenGate SNP genotyping assays (including allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, and multiplexed primer extension and ligation reaction) were performed using the genomic DNA of mapping individuals and parental genotypes (following the standard manufacturer's protocol of Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA with minor modifications).31,48 The hybridization of fluorescent dye-labelled PCR products onto a decoded SAM was performed using Illumina BeadArray Express Reader. The Illumina GenomeStudio Genotyping software V2011.1 was used for normalization of intensity data and assigning cluster positions of each SNP. To assign valid genotypes at each SNP locus and for measuring the reliability of SNP detection based on distribution of genotypic classes, minimum GenCall and GenTrain cut-off scores of 0.3 were used. The cluster separation score provided by GenCall software module for 192 mapping individuals and parental genotypes was optimized manually based on degree of separation between homozygous and heterozygous clusters as normalized <U+03B8> value [(2/p) Tan-1 (Cy5/Cy3)] in each SNP locus.Moreover, 48 previously reported genomic SSR markers49–51 (physically/genetically mapped on chromosome 1) showing polymorphism between parents of mapping population were selected. The synthesized SSR markers (normal and/or fluorescent dye-labelled) were PCR amplified in the genomic DNA of 192 selected mapping individuals and parental genotypes using touchdown thermal cycling profiling and standard PCR constituents20,52 and resolved on 3.5% metaphor agarose gel and automated fragment analyzer. For automated fragment analysis, the amplified FAM-labelled PCR products along with ABI GeneScan-600 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems, IL, USA) were resolved in automated 96 capillary ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer. The electropherogram containing trace files were analysed (as per Kujur et al.20) using GeneMapper V4.0.2.4. Traditional QTL mappingThe SNP and SSR marker genotyping data showing goodness of fit to the expected Mendelian 1:1 segregation ratio were used for linkage analysis using JoinMap 4.1 (http://www.kyazma.nl/index.php/mc.JoinMap) at higher LOD (logarithm of odds) threshold (>5.0) with Kosambi mapping function. The markers integrated into linkage group (LG) based on their centiMorgan (cM) genetic distance were designated corresponding to genetic/physical positions of markers (anchor SSR markers) mapped on the chromosome as reported by previous studies.49,50,53–56 The QTL mapping was performed by integrating the genotyping data of markers mapped on LG of intra-specific genetic map with multi-location/years replicated SW field phenotyping data of 192 mapping individuals. The composite interval mapping function of QTL Cartographer v2.557 and multiple QTL model (MQM mapping) of MapQTL v6.158 at significant (P = 0.05) LOD threshold score of =4.0 (1,000 permutations) were used to estimate the phenotypic variation explained (PVE, R2%) by the QTLs and their additive effect on SW trait.2.5. Differential gene expression profilingTo infer the gene regulation patterns during seed development, differential expression profiling using the genes annotated at the major genomic interval underlying a robust SW QTL (identified by both QTL-seq and traditional QTL mapping) was performed. The RNA isolated from different vegetative (leaf) and reproductive (seed) tissues and two seed developmental stages20,21,24 of low and high seed weight homozygous mapping individuals (used in QTL-seq analysis) and parental genotypes was amplified using the gene-specific primers via semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays (following Kujur et al.20).2.6. Allele mining and natural allelic diversity in a seed weight-regulating candidate geneFor mining the novel alleles and determining the natural allelic diversity, one SW-associated candidate gene validated by QTL-seq, traditional QTL mapping and differential expression profiling was targeted. The fragments covering the entire coding and non-coding sequence components (including 2 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream regulatory region) of this gene were amplified using the genomic DNA of 94 cultivated and wild chickpea genotypes (belonging to primary, secondary and tertiary gene pools59) along with mapping parents and individuals constituting the LSB and HSB. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced, and SNPs were mined within the gene following Kujur et al.20,21 To estimate the average pair-wise nucleotide diversity (<U+03B8>p) and Watterson's estimator of segregating sites (<U+03B8><U+03C9>), the SNP genotyping data were analysed with MEGA v5.060 and TASSEL v3.0 (http://www.maizegenetics.net).3. Results3.1. Genetic inheritance pattern of seed weight in an intra-specific chickpea mapping populationANOVA indicated a significant difference of SW (7.0–34.9 g with 26–29% CV and 85–88% H2) in 221 F4 individuals and parental genotypes of an intra-specific mapping population (ICC 7184 × ICC 15061) across 3 yrs (2010–13) (Table 1). The continuous variation as well as normal frequency distribution of SW in mapping individuals and parental genotypes was apparent (Fig. 1). We observed a bi-directional transgressive segregation of SW beyond that of parental genotypes in the mapping population. All these collectively inferred the quantitative genetic inheritance pattern of SW in our developed mapping population of chickpea.

Identification and mapping of a major QTL governing seed weight using QTL-seqThe NGS-based high-throughput whole-genome resequencing of two parental genotypes as well as LSB and HSB of an intra-specific mapping population generated ~61–65 millions of 100-bp high-quality short sequence reads covering 91–93% of reference desi genome. The comparative genome sequence analyses of these parental and bulk samples identified 118,321 high-quality SNPs (with read depth =10 and SNP base quality =20). The SNP-index of individual SNP differentiating the ICC 7184 and LSB from ICC 15061 and HSB was estimated. The average SNP-index across a 5 Mb genomic interval was measured individually in LSB and HSB using a 10-kb sliding window approach and plotted against all eight chromosomes of desi reference genome (Fig. 2). The <U+0394> (SNP-index) was calculated by integrating the SNP-index information of LSB and HSB, and plotted against the genomic positions (Mb) of desi genome. Following the principle of SNP-index estimation in QTL-seq analysis,42,43 a major genomic region (836,859 to 872,247 bp) on chromosome 1 displaying an average SNP-index of higher than 0.9 in HSB and lower than 0.1 in LSB was identified (Fig. 2). The detailed analysis of this target genomic region indicated that the low and high seed weight mapping individuals constituting the LSB and HSB contained most of the SNP alleles from ICC 7184 and ICC 15061, respectively. Moreover, one major genomic region [CaSNP8 (836,859 bp) to CaSNP10 (872,247 bp)] harbouring a SW QTL identified on chromosome 1 had <U+0394> (SNP-index) value significantly different from 0 at 99% significance level (Figs 2 and 3A and B). These findings by QTL-seq confirmed the presence of a major QTL (designated as CaqSW1.1) regulating SW at the 35 kb [836,859 (CaSNP8) to 872,247 (CaSNP10) bp] genomic interval on chromosome 1 of chickpea (Fig. 3A and B). All the SNPs localized at the target SW QTL (CaqSW1.1) interval (identified by QTL-seq) with expected allelic discrimination were further validated through resequencing of PCR amplicons amplified from the mapping individuals constituting the LSB and HSB, including parental genotypes. SNP-index graphs depicting the HSB (high seed weight bulk), LSW (low seed weight bulk) and <U+0394> (SNP-index) graphs generated from QTL-seq study. The X-axis denotes the physical positions (Mb) of eight desi chickpea chromosomes. The Y-axis represents the SNP-index, which is estimated according to 5 Mb physical interval with a 10 kb sliding window. Using the statistical confidence intervals under null hypothesis of no QTL (P < 0.05) as per Takagi et al.,42 the <U+0394> (SNP-index) was plotted. One candidate major genomic interval (836,859–872,247 bp) (marked by asterisk) harbouring a robust SW QTL (CaqSW1.1) was defined using the criteria of SNP-index near to 1 and 0 in HSB and LSB, respectively, and the confidence value of <U+0394> (SNP-index) above 0.5 (at significance level P < 0.05).

Validation of QTL-seq-derived seed weight QTL through traditional QTL mappingTo check the accuracy of a major SW QTL identified by QTL-seq, the traditional QTL mapping was performed. For this, the genotyping data of 95 markers (including 87 SNPs and 8 genomic SSR anchor markers mapped on a high-density intra-specific genetic map of LG/chromosome 1) showing polymorphism between parental genotypes as well as LSB and HSB was integrated with multi-location/years replicated field phenotyping data of 192 F4 mapping individuals (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. 3C). The interval mapping and composite interval mapping-based classical QTL analysis identified and mapped one major genomic region [CaSNP7 (3.7 cM) to CaSNP12 (5.5 cM)] harbouring a significant robust (LOD: 19.7) SW QTL (CaqSW1.1) (covered by seven SNP and SSR markers) on chickpea chromosome 1 (Fig. 3C). The integration of genetic linkage and physical map information of chickpea genome revealed correspondence of 1.8 cM SW QTL (CaqSW1.1) interval with 1,366,372 bp [CaSNP7 (5,380,861 bp) to CaSNP12 (1,904,458 bp)] genomic region on chromosome 1. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained (R2) by CaqSW1.1 QTL was 47.6%. The identified CaqSW1.1 QTL exhibiting consistent phenotypic expression, including major effect on SW trait variation across three geographical locations as well as years/seasons in field, was considered as ‘robust QTL’ as per Saxena et al.24 The positive additive gene effect of this QTL for increasing seed weight with effective allelic contribution from high seed weight genotype ICC 15061 was evident. In addition, one genomic region [CaSNP50 (52.6 cM) to CaSNP55 (60.2 cM)] underlying a robust SW QTL (CaqSW1.2) (8.7% R2 at LOD 5.4) covered with four SSR and SNP markers was identified and mapped on chromosome 1. This 7.6 cM target QTL interval showing positive additive effect corresponded to 139,393 bp [CaSNP50 (5,537,208 bp) to CaSNP55 (5,676,601 bp)] genomic region on chromosome 1.3.4. Delineation of a candidate gene at the major seed weight QTL interval by integrating QTL-seq and classical QTL mapping with differential expression profilingThe correspondence of QTL-seq outcomes with classical QTL mapping inferred that one narrow 0.6 cM [3.9 (CaSNP8) to 4.5 (CaSNP10) cM] robust QTL (CaqSW1.1) interval harbouring a 35 kb major genomic region [836,859 (CaSNP8) to 872,247 (CaSNP10) kb] on chromosome 1 was associated with 100-seed weight in chickpea (Fig. 3C). The structural and functional annotation of this CaqSW1.1 QTL region with desi genome annotation database identified six protein-coding candidate genes (Fig. 3D). Remarkably, one SNP locus (CaSNP8: G/A) in the coding region of constitutive photomorphogenic9 (COP9) signalosome complex subunit 8 (CSN8) gene showing tight linkage with a major SW robust QTL (CaqSW1.1) (based on single marker analysis of traditional QTL mapping) was considered as one of the potential candidate regulating seed weight in chickpea.To delineate the potential candidate gene regulating seed weight in chickpea, differential expression profiling of six genes annotated at the 35 kb major genomic region underlying a CaqSW1.1 QTL was performed. The RNA isolated from leaves and two seed developmental stages of low and high seed weight representative homozygous mapping individuals and parental genotypes was amplified with the six gene-based primers using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT–PCR assays (Fig. 4A). One SNP (G/A)-carrying CSN8 gene of these, at CaqSW1.1 QTL interval, exhibited seed-specific expression (compared with leaves) as well as pronounced up-regulation (>7-folds) in high seed weight parental genotype (ICC 15061) and homozygous mapping individuals during seed development (Fig. 4B). However, this gene was down-regulated (>3-folds) in seed developmental stages of low seed weight parental genotype (ICC 7184) and homozygous mapping individuals. These findings indicate that a CSN8 gene localized at the major SW QTL interval (CaqSW1.1) could be a potential candidate regulating seed weight in chickpea.

Mining of novel allelic variants for understanding the natural allelic diversity in a seed weight-regulating geneTo infer the natural allelic diversity (functional molecular diversity), one SW-governing CSN8 gene validated by QTL-seq, classical QTL mapping and expression profiling was selected. The cloned fragments amplified from entire coding and non-coding regions (including 2 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream regulatory regions) of this 6,741 bp gene were sequenced among 94 cultivated and wild chickpea genotypes (encompassing primary, secondary and tertiary gene pools) along with mapping parents and individuals constituting the LSB and HSB (Fig. 5A). This analysis identified eight SNPs of which seven SNPs (five upstream and downstream regulatory and two coding SNPs) were polymorphic exclusively among the genotypes belonging to wild species. The remaining one coding SNP (G/A) tightly linked to a major CaqSW1.1 QTL exhibited differentiation specifically among the cultivated desi and kabuli genotypes. This coding SNP further discriminated low seed weight mapping parental genotypes and all individuals of LSB from the high seed weight mapping parents and HSB individuals. A higher nucleotide diversity of SNPs discovered from a SW-associated CSN8 gene in the wild species/accessions (mean <U+03B8>p: 0.31 and <U+03B8><U+03C9>: 0.28) compared with cultivated species/accessions (0.12 and 0.10) was evident.

DiscussionThe present study identified and mapped one major genomic region harbouring a robust 100-seed weight QTL (CaqSW1.1) on chromosome 1 using an intra-specific desi chickpea mapping population via whole-genome NGS-based high-throughput QTL-seq approach. This QTL-seq (based on SNP-index)-derived SW QTL (CaqSW1.1) was further validated by SNP and SSR marker-based traditional QTL mapping (at higher LOD >19). This suggests the validity and robustness of QTL-seq as a strategy for quick and efficient scanning of major QTL at a genome-wide scale in chickpea. The advantages of QTL-seq vis-a-vis other available traditional QTL mapping approaches (involving near-isogenic and recombinant inbred lines, Tuinstra et al.61; Monforte and Tanksley62; Loudet et al.63) to identify major QTLs governing seedling vigour, blast resistance and flowering time in crop plants (including rice and cucumber) for instance, have been recently reported.40,41 Moreover, our study ascertained the wider applicability of QTL-seq approach both in preliminary as well as much advanced generation mapping populations (RILs) by identifying a major seed weight-regulatory QTL in an intra-specific F4 mapping population of chickpea. The narrowing down of 1.8 cM CaqSW1.1 major QTL interval [CaSNP7 (3.7 cM) to CaSNP12 (5.5 cM)] identified by classical QTL mapping into 0.6 cM seed weight-associated QTL region [CaSNP8 (3.9 cM) to -CaSNP10 (4.5 cM)] through QTL-seq was evident. This reflects the potential of QTL-seq over traditional QTL analysis for high-resolution genome mapping and subsequent fine mapping of target candidate genomic region harbouring a major trait-associated QTL. The underlying reason could be the NGS-based high-throughput genome-wide SNP scan between parental genotypes and individuals selected under study with contrasting phenotypes (low and high seed weight) of an intra-specific mapping population. A much closer examination of SNP-index and <U+0394> (SNP-index) among parental genotypes as well as individuals constituting the HSB and LSB at major CaqSW1.1 QTL indicated minor contribution of ~20% low seed weight alleles in high seed weight parental genotypes and mapping individuals. This is in line with transgressive segregation and quantitative genetic inheritance pattern of 100-seed weight observed in the intra-specific mapping population under study. The detection of another minor (<10% R2 at LOD 5.4) SW QTL (CaqSW1.2) in chromosome 1 through traditional QTL mapping infers the possible shortcoming of QTL-seq approach to identify minor QTLs explaining low phenotypic variation specifically for quantitative agronomic traits. Further large-scale validation of these identified major (CaqSW1.1) and minor (CaqSW1.2) SW QTLs in diverse genetic background and/or through fine mapping/positional cloning is essential prior to their implementation in genomics-assisted breeding of chickpea for higher seed weight and yield.The integration of QTL-seq with traditional QTL mapping (combining QTL-linked/flanking marker genetic and physical mapping information) narrowed down the 1.37 Mb [CaSNP7 (5,380,861 bp) to CaSNP12 (1,904,458 bp) containing 177 genes] major seed weight QTL region (CaqSW1.1) into a 35 kb physical interval [CaSNP8 (836,859 bp) to CaSNP10 (872,247 bp) carrying six genes] on chromosome 1, which explained ~47.6% of the phenotypic variation of 100-seed weight. The differential expression profiling of six protein-coding genes annotated at this target genomic region further delimited the 35 kb physical interval into a coding SNP (G/A)-carrying potential CSN8 gene. The seed-specific expression as well as pronounced differential up-/down-regulation of this candidate gene in high and low seed weight parental genotypes and homozygous mapping individuals during seed development was apparent. However, we could not find any SNPs in the 2 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream regulatory regions of a SW-associated CSN gene that showed differentiation among the cultivated desi and kabuli genotypes, including mapping parents and individuals of LSB and HSB. Therefore, speculating any possible correlation between regulatory sequence polymorphism and molecular mechanism underlying differential transcript accumulation of CSN gene during seed development especially in cultivated chickpea requires further experimentation. The sequence variant analysis targeting beyond the 2 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream regulatory regions of CSN gene may provide additional clues regarding its differential regulation during seed development in chickpea. The functional relevance of coding gene-derived SNPs for regulating diverse agronomic traits, including seed (grain) size/weight, have been well demonstrated in rice and chickpea.64–67,20,21 These findings collectively inferred that a combinatorial approach of QTL-seq, traditional QTL mapping and differential gene expression profiling have the potential to delineate one coding SNP (G/A)-carrying CSN8 candidate gene at a major QTL interval regulating seed weight in chickpea. The implication of integrated genomic approach (combining genetic and association mapping with transcript profiling) to delineate potential candidate genes harbouring major trait-associated QTLs has been well documented in chickpea.20,21,24,68 The non-congruence of two SW QTLs (CaqSW1.1 and CaSW1.2) identified in our study with that of previously reported known SW QTLs2,7,20,21,24,25,68–71 (comparing genetic/physical positions of these QTLs-linked/flanking markers mapped on diverse intra-/inter-specific linkage maps) was observed. This suggests the population-specific genetic inheritance pattern of our identified novel QTLs regulating seed weight in chickpea. Henceforth, our proposed integrated strategy can be employed for rapid identification of major potential genes, QTLs and alleles associated with qualitative as well as quantitative traits in diverse crop plants. The novel allelic variants mined from the diverse coding and non-coding sequence components of one seed weight-associated CSN8 gene revealed a dramatic reduction of natural allelic diversity in cultivated species/genotypes in contrast to wild species/genotypes encompassing primary, secondary and tertiary gene pools. In spite of higher allelic diversity in wild species/genotypes, one seed weight-associated locus (G/A) in CSN8 gene was completely absent from all the wild genotypes. However, this potential seed weight-regulating gene locus was present in all the desi and kabuli genotypes of cultivated species. This clearly reflects the possible effect of strong artificial and/or natural selection pressure on this seed weight gene locus during chickpea domestication. Further analysis involving all the natural allelic variants mined and potential locus targeted by natural and/or artificial selection in a SW-governing gene is required to gain a deeper insight into the complex seed weight trait evolution in chickpea. This will further assist us to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying fixation of such complex quantitative trait in domesticated chickpea that are adapted to diverse agro-climatic conditions.The COP9 signalosome complex subunit 8 (CSN8) chickpea gene homolog having 83% amino acid sequence conservation with Arabidopsis thaliana gene (At4g14110) (Fig. 5B) is known to be a major factor controlling growth and development in multiple plant species, including Arabidopsis.72–76 This evolutionary conserved multi-protein gene complex is said to be involved in regulation of various E3 ubiquitin ligases and auxin response-mediated developmental pathways in crop plants.72,73 However, functional validation and a detailed molecular characterization of this gene are required to understand its definite role in seed weight regulation in chickpea. Therefore, a major seed weight-regulating CSN gene identified at the robust QTL interval by integrating QTL-seq and classical QTL mapping with differential expression profiling, once functionally validated could be utilized as a potential candidate for marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea for enhancing its seed weight as well as yield.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe authors acknowledge the financial support for this research study provided by a research grant from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India (102/IFD/SAN/2161/2013-14).

IntroductionWith the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), we have seen a surge of discovery of millions of genetic variants, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from different species. Characterization of these variants with the goal to delineate those with potential functional implications (pfVars) is often challenging, especially in the absence of comprehensive annotation of genomes for functional elements. Today for some model species, e.g. chicken, the genomes are well annotated for protein-coding regions. As a consequence, our ability to characterize coding variants is much more mature. Additionally, many methods are available to predict the effects of amino acid (AA)-altering variants on protein functions by using evolutionary and biochemical information.1–4 These resources have allowed extensive study of the effects of protein-coding variants on disease and other traits.5 The protein-coding regions, however, occupy only a small portion of the genome (~1.5%) while the rest is non-coding.6 In spite of this, biological research on non-coding mutations has been limited partly due to the difficulty in interpreting their effects and partly due to the poor annotation of most genomes for functional non-coding elements (fNCEs). The situation, however, is improving rapidly. For instance, a great deal of insight on fNCEs has been generated by the human ENCODE project.7 The importance of non-coding variants is further highlighted from the evidence gathered from meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies, which found that 88% of the trait-associated mutations are non-coding.8 Complex traits, in particular, are overwhelmingly associated with non-coding mutations, suggesting that these mutations have primarily regulatory roles.9 Some predictive models have been developed to assess the effects of SNPs on secondary structures of RNAs, as structural characteristics are often crucial for the functioning of various non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and cis-regulatory elements in mRNAs.10–13Due to scarcity of information on functional elements, particularly the fNCEs, researchers have often adopted evolutionary analyses as a means to locating these elements in genomes, in which, regions conserved across species are assumed to be under purifying selection and functionally important.14,15 Mutations within such regions are therefore considered deleterious.4 Although these approaches are able to identify regions under purifying selection, they are not suitable for detecting regions evolving rapidly16 that are subject to recent positive selections. A number of approaches based on allele frequency spectra and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure have been proposed for detecting signatures of positive selection by looking for regions exhibiting local fixation, unusually long LD and/or population differentiation that appear in a non-neutral manner compared with the rest of the genome.17,18The aim of the present study was to characterize millions of SNPs detected from the chicken genome in a large NGS project with the goal to identify pfVars. A number of complementary approaches were used to delineate pfVars from both coding and non-coding regions: (i) annotation of the variants against known genes, (ii) predicting effects of the AA-altering variants on protein function, (iii) predicting effects of variants on the secondary structures of mRNAs and ncRNAs, (iv) finding variants that coincided with most conserved elements and (v) detecting regions of local fixation as putative signatures of recent positive selection and considering the fixed pfVars within these as sources of candidate causal mutations of various phenotypes. Since chicken is a major farm animal and an important model organism for genetic and genomic studies, detection and characterization of genetic variants, especially the pfVars, have major incentives for and implications in both research and breeding.2. Materials and methods2.1. Resequencing of chicken samplesDetails about the sequenced samples, method of sequencing and alignment of sequence reads to reference genome can be found in a previous study by Kranis et al.19 In brief, 243 chickens were sequenced and these originated from 24 lines: four commercial broilers (B1–B4), six commercial white egg layers (WEL 1–6), five commercial brown egg layers (BEL 1–5), eight experimental inbred layers (I1–8) and one unselected layer line (RI-J). For 23 lines, DNAs from 10–15 individuals were pooled for creating the libraries, whereas for a single line (WEL6) three individuals were sequenced separately. Sequencing was performed on Illumina GAIIx platform using a paired-end protocol and the sequencing reads were mapped to the reference genome using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA)20 v0.5.7 using default setting.2.2. Variant callingVariant calling was performed using the ‘mpilup’ function of Samtools21 (v0.1.18) package. The minimum thresholds for base and map qualities were set to Phred-based scores of 20. Following the initial calling of SNPs, filtrations were performed using the criteria: (i) SNP quality (SNPQ) =40, (ii) coverage at SNP position =5 and = mean line coverage ± 3SD (Standard deviation), (iii) evidence of alternative (ALT) allele supported by at least two reads: one on forward strand and one on reverse, and (iv) distance between adjacent markers is >1 base. Regions with too high density of SNPs (>10 SNPs/50 bases) were excluded. The coordinates of the SNPs reported in this paper are on the latest chicken reference genome build, Gallus_gallus_4. Further details on variant calling are provided in Supplementary Information. All the filtered SNPs have been submitted to the dbSNP with the Handle ID ‘DWBURT’.2.3. Estimation of false discovery ratesFalse discovery rates (FDRs) of variant calls for the present study were estimated by calling SNPs from Sanger sequencing of 25 random genomic regions and comparing those with SNPs detected from the NGS data from the same regions (further details in Supplementary Information). For each region, only the part that had good-quality Sanger sequence in each individual was used for FDR estimation, and as a result, the lengths of the sequences spanned between 150 and 500 bp.Based on the comparison of variants from Sanger and NGS data, a SNP was called true positive (TP) when it was detected by both the method, a false positive (FP) when it was detected only by NGS and a false negative (FN) when it was detected only by Sanger. Any sequenced bases that were not called as SNPs by either of the two methods were considered to be true negatives (TNs). Based on these, sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) was defined as the proportion of actual SNPs that were detected by NGS and was calculated as: TP/(TP + FN). Specificity was defined as the proportion of actual non-SNPs not detected as SNPs by NGS and calculated as: TN/(TN + FP). FP and FN rates were calculated as (1-specificity) and (1-sensitivity), respectively. The proportion of FP SNPs in the NGS data at different filtration criteria was calculated as: FP/(total NGS SNPs retained by the criteria).2.4. Functional annotation and characterization of SNPsThe 15 million SNPs were annotated against the chicken gene database from ENSEMBL (release 71) and most conserved element (MCE) database from UCSC using the software package ANNOVAR (version July 06, 2012).22 The MCEs on chicken genome were predicted by PhastCons package by aligning the genomes of six distant species, namely, human, mouse, rat, oppssum, X. tropicalis and zebrafish to chicken genome.23 To annotate against the MCEs, the co-ordinates of the SNPs were first converted to Gallus_gallus_3 genome build as the MCEs are mapped onto this build.The effects of non-synonymous SNPs on protein function were predicted based on evolutionary conservation using the SIFT (jcvi-sift 1.03)1,2 and PROVEAN (v1.1.3)3 packages. SIFT prediction depends on the degree of conservation at individual AA positions, assuming that functionally important positions have been conserved over evolutionary timescale. Using multiple alignment of homologous but distantly related peptide sequences, SIFT calculates normalized probabilities (SIFT score) of observing all possible AA residues at a position. If the SIFT score of an altered AA is below certain threshold, the variant is considered evolutionary intolerant (INTOL) while above the threshold the variants are considered tolerant (TOL). In contrast, PROVEAN computes an unbiased averaged delta alignment score from multiple alignments of homologous but distantly related peptides as a metric to predict the effects of coding mutations. Below certain threshold of delta score, the variant is declared INTOL. For the present study, SIFT was run using locally generated peptide alignments consisting of sequences from the UniRef90 non-redundant peptide database and predicted sequences from additional 47 bird genomes recently generated by BGI. Sequences were filtered to remove those peptides with over 90% sequence identity to a representative sample using the CD-HIT package and then aligned using Muscle (v.3.8.31). Default scores (<0.05 for SIFT score and >3.25 for conservation score) were used to classify the SNPs as either evolutionary intolerant (INTOL) or tolerant (TOL). PROVEAN was run with the default parameters on the NCBI non-redundant protein database. CD-HIT package was used to remove redundancy and Muscle package was used to generate the alignment. Default threshold (-2.28) of the delta score—defined as the change in alignment score due to introduction of a mutation—was used to differentiate INTOL variants from TOLs.The effects of SNPs on the secondary structures of mRNAs and ncRNAs were predicted using RNAsnp12,24 package. Predictions were performed using two Modes (1 and 2) using default parameters as detailed in the package. The Mode 1 calculates the base-pair probabilities of the wild-type and mutant RNA sequences using a ‘global folding’ algorithm and computes the structural difference between wild and mutant types using Euclidian distance or Pearson's correlation co-efficient for all sequence intervals or local regions. As outputs, the interval with maximum base pairing distance (d_max) or minimum correlation co-efficient (r_min) is reported along with the corresponding P-values. The Mode 2, on the other hand, uses a ‘local folding’ algorithm to calculate base pairing probabilities and is designed to predict the effects of SNPs on large RNA sequences. In a two-step process, this mode first calculates the structural difference using Euclidian distance for all sequence intervals of fixed window length. In the second step, the interval with maximum base pair distance and the corresponding P-value is reported. The P-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hotchberg (B–H) method.25Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPAs) were performed for the genes harbouring potentially deleterious sets of SNPs to gain insight into the biological pathways that are affected. For these analyses, the genes with target group of SNPs were set as up-regulated molecules against the rest of the chicken genes. B–H multiple testing correction was performed and pathways were considered to be enriched with target molecules only when they remained significant (at P = 0.05) after the correction.Allele frequency of each SNP was estimated based on the proportion of good-quality reads supporting the alternative or non-reference allele. Mean frequencies of individual variants were calculated based on the frequency estimates from the populations where the SNP was detected.2.5. Selection signature analysisHere <U+2211>nMAJ and <U+2211>nMIN are the sum of major and minor allele counts within a window, respectively. Only windows with >10 SNPs were analysed. BEDTools v2.17.0 was used for creating and intersecting the windows with SNP data, and Hp calculation was performed using custom scripts. The Hp calculation was performed within each commercial broiler (B1–B4), BEL (BEL1–BEL5) and WEL (WEL1–WEL5) lines where pooled samples were sequenced. Significance cut-offs for the Hp values were decided empirically based on chromosome-wise permutation analysis following the methods described by Churchill and Doerge27 and Qanbari et al.28 for individual lines. For the permutation tests, the allele count data were shuffled for 10,000 times within chromosomes, but the SNP positions were kept fixed.3. Results and discussions3.1. Detection of SNPs and FDRsInitial calling of variants using the criteria of base quality =20 and map quality =20 detected ~48 million putative SNPs, which were either segregating or fixed for a non-reference or alternative allele within a line. Upon filtration based on several criteria viz. minimum SNPQ, acceptable coverage, number of reads supporting the alternative allele, inter-marker gap and removal of regions with too high density of variants—over 15 million (n = 15,310,407) high-quality SNPs were retained. These formed the basis of subsequent analyses described in this paper. About 48% of the 15 million SNPs are common with known variants in dbSNP (build140) which currently contains ~8.9 million SNPs for chicken.The filtered variants were distributed in the genome with an average density of 15 SNPs (± 9.54) per kb or 1 SNP per every 68 bases, although the number of variants in each 1 kb window varied widely ranging from 0 to 112. The number of SNPs detected from each line varied between 3.6 and 5 million. The proportions of segregating variants within lines varied widely ranging from 8 to 77%. For inbred lines, this proportion was particularly low with an average of 21% while the corresponding averages for the commercial lines were ~74% for broilers, 53% for WELs and 48% for BELs. The smaller proportion of segregating SNPs in the inbred lines was expected as these lines have been developed through many generations of close-mating.Even though stringent filtration criteria are often applied to minimize the FPs from NGS data, uncertainties in variant calling may still persist due to alignment errors, inaccurate base calling and insufficient coverage. FDRs for the present study were, therefore, estimated by comparing SNP calls from Sanger Sequence of 25 random regions with that from NGS for the same regions. In total, 97 SNPs were detected from Sanger sequencing of the 11,801 bases while the number of NGS variants from these regions varied depending on the stringency of filtration criteria used (Supplementary Table S1). Before filtration, there were 200 NGS SNPs including all the 97 SNPs detected by Sanger. The Fig. 1a and b compare the FDRs of two filtration methods: (i) using only the SNPQ as filtration criterion and (ii) using SNPQ in combination with the criterion of support of alternative allele by at least two reads—one on the forward strand and one on the reverse strand. Figure 1a shows the trade-off between the FPRs and TPRs for the NGS data using Sanger sequencing as the gold standard. It emphasizes several points. First, the TPRs were very high for NGS although not perfect when high-quality scores were imposed. Second, the FPRs were small in relation to the number of sequenced bases and reduced as higher quality scores were imposed. Third, filtration using Method2 was more effective than Method1 in reducing the FPR. Comparison of two methods of filtration on false discovery rates (FDRs) of SNP call.

It shows that when the criterion of support of alternative allele by at least one forward- and one reverse-stranded reads alone was applied without any filtration on SNPQ (i.e. when SNPQ = 0), the error rate dropped drastically from 51 to 26%. At SNPQ = 40, imposing this criterion reduced the error rate from 13 to 3% but at the same time increased the FNR (Supplementary Table S1). This error rate of 3% in detecting SNPs from NGS data is comparable to the rates reported in other studies such as 4.5% reported for chicken26 and 2.6% for turkey.29Prediction of FNR, however, is more difficult as it may be affected by a range of factors such as missing regions in the genome assembly where variant calling was not possible, extent of repeat regions in the genome, presence of regions that are difficult to sequence due to their biochemical properties and attempt to reduce FPs resulting from alignment artefact due to presence of indels or duplicated regions. As a consequence, even though the above analysis estimated FNR to be only 2% with Method 2 (Supplementary Table S1), the actual rate is expected to be much higher. Since the goal of the present study was to characterize a set of high-quality SNPs by minimizing the FPs, the application of stringent criteria was justified even with some compromise on the FNR.3.2. Coding and non-coding variantsOnly 2.2% of the 15 million SNPs was predicted to be within protein-coding regions and 1.2% as AA-altering (non-synonymous and stop-gain/loss) when annotated against the ENSEMBL gene database for chicken. The rest of the SNPs were classified as non-coding (Table 1). Apart from the AA-altering variants, the other potentially functional categories included: variants with the potential to disrupt splicing events (0.09%); variants in 3'and 5' UTRs with the potential to regulate protein translation (1.3%); those within 1 kb up- or downstream of transcription start or end sites with possible roles on transcriptional regulation (2.8%); and finally, the SNPs belonging to ncRNAs (0.02%). In addition to the ENSEMBL gene database, all the SNPs were checked against 1,608 ncRNA transcripts, which have recently been characterized.30 A total of 2,062 (0.01%) variants fell within these transcripts: 131 in CD-snoRNAs, 155 in HACA-snoRNAs, 1,073 in microRNAs, 241 in regulatory regions, 82 in tRNAs, and the remaining 380 were in unclassified transcripts. Some of these ncRNA variants (n = 284) were previously annotated to be within protein-coding genes (exonic, UTR and intronic categories) when the ENSEMBL database was used. Major proportions of these SNPs with dual annotation were enriched for three ncRNA categories: regulatory region (34% of the 284), microRNA (27%) and tRNA (14%) types. Such overlaps could be due to potential difficulty in distinguishing ncRNA from mRNA or might truly reflect regions having dual functions as both non-coding and coding.31SNPs belonging to different annotation categoriesaThe percentages are in relation to 15 million SNPs.bAAF refers to Alternative allele frequency.cThe percentages are in relation to the number of SNPs within the annotation category.SNPs belonging to different annotation categoriesaThe percentages are in relation to 15 million SNPs.bAAF refers to Alternative allele frequency.cThe percentages are in relation to the number of SNPs within the annotation category.The AA-altering SNPs (n = 183,320) were detected from 13,286 genes representing 74% of the known genes in chicken. Their density in terms of length of coding sequence varied widely across the genes ranging from 1 SNP per 19 bases to 1 per 731 kb (mean 1 SNP per 5.5 kb). A high degree of correlation (r = 0.75, P<0.001), however, was observed between the densities of AA-altering and synonymous mutations. This correlation combined with the large variation in the densities of coding SNPs indicate that some genes are more prone to accumulate variants either due to differential mutation rates or uneven selection pressure.32 IPA demonstrated that the genes with high density of AA-altering variants (>10 SNPs/kb coding sequence) were significantly enriched in nine biological pathways (P = 0.05 after correction for multiple testing). These pathways were associated with a DNA replication, recombination and repair, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and amino acids, and cancer (Supplementary Table S2). It is difficult to explain why certain genes within important pathways harbour high density of AA-altering variants. One explanation is that not all of these variants were predicted to have radical effect on the function of the genes, and when harmful, they were generally present at low frequencies; these aspects have been further explored in the next two sections. Closer inspection of these genes further reveals that majority of these (~70%) have one or more paralogs in the genome, indicating that the loss of function of the genes due to deleterious variants may partly be rescued by their paralogous genes. There were, however, 20 genes that showed extreme SNP density (=50 SNPs/kb coding sequence). While these genes may represent regions with rapid mutation rates, it is possible that the high variant density in these genes is actually a result of error in the reference genome assembly and/or error in mapping of sequence reads due to high level of duplications. Eleven of these 20 genes had no paralog in the genome and may represent assembly errors. The other 9 genes had one or more paralogs, as many as 58, and the high SNP density may be a result of mapping errors.3.3. Negative impact of non-synonymous substitutions on protein functionEven though non-synonymous SNPs change amino acid sequence within a protein, the effects are not always harmful or radical on protein function. Using SIFT, 23% of the non-synonymous variants (n = 41,980) were predicted as ‘intolerant’ (INTOL) having radical effect and 51% were predicted ‘tolerant’ (TOL) (Supplementary Fig. S1a). The remaining 26% did not have any predictions either due to lack of sufficient aligned sequences or poor confidence in predictions. Contrary to this, PROVEAN provided predictions for >98% of the SNPs and much higher proportion of the variants (45%; n = 82,564) were predicted as INTOL (Supplementary Fig. S1b). This can be attributed to two factors. First, PROVEAN takes into account the sequence context of a variant rather than only individual amino acid position.3 Second, in the absence of homologous peptides, PROVEAN can still perform analysis by comparing the alignment of the query sequence to itself before and after the introduction of the mutation, which is not possible with SIFT. Together 49% of the non-synonymous SNPs (n = 88,655) were predicted INTOL by at least one of the algorithms while only 20% (n = 35,889) were predicted as INTOL by both.IPA analysis of genes harbouring INTOL non-synonymous SNPs from broiler, WEL and BEL groups suggested many pathways (n = 162–211 after multiple testing correction), especially signalling pathways (87–92%), to be significantly enriched for these variants (See the Supplementary Table S3 for the top five pathways from each group). Most of the INTOL variants were found to have low frequency and were detected from few lines only (Supplementary Fig. S2), thereby limiting their harmful effect (see next section for further information on allele frequency). This can explain how important pathways could harbour INTOL variants. IPA analysis on inbred lines found only two pathways as significant of which the ‘Role of BRCA1 in DNA Damage Response’ was found highly significant (P < 0.001; with 20 of the 71 genes passing the cut-off criteria). This pathway consists of genes encoding for tumour suppressors and DNA damage repair proteins. Since, the inbred lines have been bred for experimental purposes for susceptibility/resistance to different viral pathogens, such as Marek's Disease Virus (MDV), Avian Leucosis Virus (ALV) and Lymphoid Leucosis Virus (LLV), it is likely that these genes within these pathways are candidates for explaining the susceptibility/resistance towards these pathogens.3.4. Effects of SNPs on RNA secondary structureThe functions of many ncRNAs and cis-regulatory elements in mRNAs often rely on their distinctive secondary structures.12 Previous studies have shown that mutations within untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNA transcripts can alter the structures of cis-acting regulatory elements that reside within these regions and thereby affect the translational and transcriptional efficiency and stability of mRNAs.33,34 Even apparently silent synonymous mutations have been shown to affect mRNA folding and stability, altering protein translation.35 Therefore, in the present study, the putative effects of all UTR, synonymous, non-synonymous and ncRNA variants on the secondary structures of RNAs were investigated using the RNAsnp package.About 9% (n = 19,296) of the UTR, 11% (n = 19,603) of the non-synonymous, 8% (n = 12,001) of synonymous and 7% (n = 218) of the ncRNA variants were predicted to affect RNA secondary structure by at least one of the parameters and models used (P = 0.05 before correcting for multiple testing) (Supplementary Table S4). Although after correcting for multiple testing, only 15 variants (4 UTR3', 7 ncRNA and 4 non-synonymous) remained significant (P = 0.05), the other variants, however, can still be considered suggestive and be used for shortlisting candidate functional variants. These variants including the suggestive ones were located within 12,296 protein-coding genes and 176 ncRNA transcripts.3.5. SNPs within evolutionary conserved elementsGenomic regions conserved across distantly related species are assumed to be under purifying selection, and hence variants within these regions are likely to be harmful. The 15 million SNPs were annotated against the 950,084 known ‘most conserved elements’ (MCEs; UCSC23), covering 6.5% of the genome and with their sizes varying from 1 base to 4.3 kb (median 43 bases).About 3.5% (n = 537,966) of the 15 million variants fell within only 2.5% of the MCEs, while the rest of the conserved elements were devoid of any SNPs. The density of variants within MCEs was 8 SNPs/kb, which was much lower compared with the genome-wide density of 15 SNPs/kb, supporting their conserved nature. Major proportions of the MCE variants belonged to intronic (38%), exonic (33%) and intergenic (23%) categories while the remaining 5% fell within other categories such as UTR (2.2%), up/downstream (1.8%) and splicing (0.9%) and ncRNA (0.1%). Among the MCE-exonic variants, 51% (n = 91,789) were AA altering and majority of these (n = 60,016) were predicted as INTOL as was expected due to the evolutionary conserved nature of these regions.3.6. Allele frequency distributions of SNPs in different annotation categoriesFrequency distributions of non-reference or alternative alleles (AAF) of pfVar categories were compared with those of potential neutral variants to investigate differences in their patterns (Figs 2 and 3, Table 1). This revealed a number of aspects. First, except in the Inbred group, in commercial chickens the non-synonymous, stop-gain/loss and splicing variants were heavily skewed to the left, i.e. fell within lower frequency bins compared with other SNP categories. About 50–61% of the AA-altering and splicing variants had AAF = 0.3, whereas synonymous, intronic and intergenic variants, which are largely assumed to be neutral, showed more or less even distributions across the frequency bins (Figs 2 and 3). The overall mean frequency for AA-altering and splicing variants was 0.35 (SD: 0.22) compared with 0.58 (SD: 0.25) for synonymous or 0.63 (SD: 0.24) for intergenic and intronic variants (t-test, P < 0.001). Apart from the AA-altering and splicing variants, ncRNA SNPs also showed a left skew in all commercial groups with ~33–37% belonging to frequency bins =0.3. (a–d) Frequency distributions of alternative alleles of SNPs from protein-coding regions. X-axis represents the allele frequency (ranges from 0 to 1) and Y-axis represents percentage of SNPs within a category. For the broiler, brown egg layer (BEL) and white egg layer (WEL) groups, the Y-axis is scaled from 0 to 25 (in percentage), and for Inbred group, the Y-axis is scaled from 0 to 50 (in percentage).(a–d) Frequency distributions of alternative alleles of SNPs from protein-coding regions.

This pattern provides confirmation to the assumption that INTOLs are more deleterious than the TOLs, but this does not equate the TOL variants with the neutral ones. Rather the left-skewed distributions of both TOL and INTOL variants indicate that non-synonymous SNPs in general are selected against.Third, comparison of frequency distribution of SNPs within MCE and non-MCE revealed that only those MCE-SNPs belonging to AA-altering, splicing or ncRNA categories had a marked difference in the allele frequency distribution compared with non-MCE categories with the former group clustering around lower frequency bins (AAF = 0.30) (Supplementary Fig. S3a–d). MCE-SNPs belonging to other annotation categories such as intergenic, intronic, etc. all showed the same pattern of frequency distributions as of neutral categories.Fourth, within the inbred group, all types of variants, irrespective of their categories, showed very high level of fixation. However, the number of AA-altering and splicing variants in inbred lines were much fewer compared with those from commercial groups (Figs 2 and 3). Especially, the number of non-syonymous INTOL variants in inbred lines was 8–11 times less than those in commercial groups. This observation indicates that the negative selection has prevented highly deleterious mutations from reaching fixation in the inbred lines and the existing INTOL variants are possibly not severely harmful under the environmental conditions these birds are raised.Finally, Figs 2 and 3 reveal that there were no SNPs within low-frequency bin (=0.05). This result was expected due to a number of reasons. First of all, the allele frequency in the present study was calculated only based on 10–15 individuals per line. This meant that estimated frequency within line could not be below 0.03–0.05. Second, the sequencing of pooled DNA (Pool-seq) is known to be extremely prone to losing rare and low-frequency variants when performed at a low depth of sequencing coverage.36,37 In the present study, the sequence coverage was 8–17X, which was often lower than the number of individuals per pool (10–15) and the corresponding number of chromosomes (20–30) that needed to be sampled. This was compounded by the use of various filtration parameters such as quality scores, minimum coverage and the evidence of non-reference allele in both forward and reverse strands, which resulted in the loss of many true SNPs, especially from low-frequency categories. Cutler and Jensen37 predicted that filtering SNPs from Pool-seq data with a Phred quality score of 20 (predicted error rate 1%) would lead to the loss of 29% of the variants when the coverage is between 11 and 50X, and majority of these variants will be rare and of low frequency. They also showed that if the error rate was very low (e.g. 0.1%) and only a small number of samples were pooled (e.g. 10 samples) that would require sequencing to a depth of 300X to detect all the variants including the rare ones.The proportions of pfVars that appeared in multiple lines (>10 lines) at high frequencies (>0.9) were investigated as these might represent variants with adaptive advantage (Table 1). Alternatively, this is also possible that these variants are only moderately deleterious or neutral and have increased in frequency through genetic drift or by hitchhiking with linked variants under positive selection. A very small proportions (0.5–2%) of stop-gain/loss, INTOL and splicing variants were detected from multiple lines at high frequency, while for categories like synonymous, intergenic, intronic, up/downstream and UTR, the corresponding proportions were much higher, above 7% (Table 1). This agrees with the general expectation that the former group of variants are selected against due to their potential harmful effects. Since stop-gain variants result in the premature termination of proteins, they were further investigated which revealed that in most cases (85%) they were located: (i) in genes that have other paralogs in the genome, which might minimize their impact (64%); (ii) in uncharacterized hypothetical genes for which no functions are yet known and these genes may be prediction artefacts (25%); (iii) near the end of coding sequence thus allowing the translation of at least 90% of the length of the protein retaining most of its functionality (16%) or at the very beginning of the protein (12%) (Supplementary Fig. S4). A similar observation was reported by Ng et al.38 Yet there were a few stop-gain variants that did not conform to any of these rules, yet were detected at very high frequencies (>0.9) from multiple lines (>10). These included three stop-gain mutations from the genes: C1ORF101 (Chr3_34083273), CCDC60 (Chr15_9679384) and GLOD4 (Chr19_6926808). Their relative position within the respective proteins (calculated by dividing the position of the variant with the protein length) varied from 0.33 to 0.67. These variants may therefore have some selective advantage in domesticated chicken lines. Similarly, over 80% of the INTOL variants detected from multiple lines at high frequencies were located within genes with one or more paralogs or in novel genes with unknown function as discussed above.Over 14% (n = 2,248,437) of the 15 million SNPs were private to individual lines. Of these, only 12.5% SNPs were fixed or nearly fixed. Although much smaller proportions of private fixed variants belonged to AA-altering and splicing categories (Table 1), these could be important for the lines in question.3.7. SNPs within regions of selection signatureOne of the signatures of positive selection is that it creates regions of local fixation compared with the overall pattern of diversity in the entire genome—a phenomenon known as a ‘selective sweep’.17 The regions of local fixation were investigated by calculating pooled heterozygosities (Hp) in sliding windows using the SNP data for individual broiler, BEL and WEL lines. Since only the windows with >10 SNPs were analysed, the number of analysable windows varied from 44,237 to 45,378 per line (Supplementary Table S5). The average Hp values varied not only among the lines (0.22–0.36) but also among chromosomes (0.16–0.43), which is likely due to the wide variation in recombination rates among chromosomes.39 Therefore, in deciding the threshold Hps for detecting putative selective sweep (pSS) regions, chromosome-specific permutation analysis was performed within each line. Proportion of the windows with fixation signal varied considerably across the lines ranging from 0.7 to 9.8% at P < 0.001 while with relaxed thresholds (at P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), the number increased considerably.Differentiating the signatures generated by true selective sweep is challenging, because similar effects might be left on the genome by demographic events and population structure.17 While the permutation test improves the confidence in detecting pSS, comparison of the signals across populations can further confirm the results and minimize the incidence of false signals from the confounding effects of demographic events.18 Therefore, in the following sections, we focus only on the common windows that passed critical Hps (at P < 0.05) in all the lines within a group (broiler, BEL or WEL) or across groups. Sex chromosomes were excluded from analyses to avoid interpretational problems as the lines were differentially consisted of either male or female samples.Common signals were detected only from 143 widows in broilers, 163 in BEL and 49 in WEL. Many of these windows were adjacent or overlapping and hence were joined to obtain non-overlapping regions that resulted in 60 discrete pSS regions for broiler, 66 for BEL and 25 for WEL (Supplementary Fig. S5). The relatively lower number of shared regions in the WEL group was due to a single line—WEL5, which elicited very few fixation signals (only 4% windows compared with ~14% in other WEL lines). This is due to the fact the WEL5 had higher level of fixation relative to other lines and as a result had low critical Hps from the chromosome-wise permutation analyses causing very few windows to elicit selective sweep signal. If WEL5 is excluded from the comparison, 208 windows and 100 non-overlapping pSS regions are found to be shared among the other four WEL lines. Across different groups, we discovered only seven windows shared between broilers and BELs, five between BEL and WEL (excluding WEL5) and only one shared between broiler and WEL (Supplementary Fig. S5).As a proof that our approach could detect sweep regions, our results were compared with previous studies. This demonstrated that many of the genes that were partly or fully covered within our pSS regions had also been detected by other studies. Some notable genes among these are the following: BCDO2 (ß-carotene oxygenase 2) that has been found associated with yellow skin in domestic chickens;40TSHR (thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor) playing important roles in regulation of metabolic functions and reproduction in commercial chickens;26IGF1(insulin-like growth factor-1) and HNF4G (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 gamma) which are candidates for growth;26,41PMCH (pro-melanin concentrating hormone) that plays important role in regulating appetite and metabolic functions;26,42INSR (insulin receptor), which affects growth traits with a central role in insulin signalling;26 and NELL1(NEL-like 1) gene, potentially associated with skeletal integrity in broiler.41 Moreover, over 91% of the pSS regions also overlapped with one or more QTLs (in chicken QTLdb) associated with production, behavioural- and health-related traits such as body weight, growth performance, meat quantity and qualities, fat content, egg production and qualities, feather pecking and antibody response to various pathogens. This provided further support in favour of predicted selection pressure on these regions.The pSS regions harboured a large number of variants (6K–12K depending on groups), either fixed or segregating. While it is expected that the variants directly under selection will be fixed or be at high frequency (AAF > 0.9), the other functionally active segregating variants within the pSS regions may be selectively advantageous or deleterious and will exert their effects quantitatively on the associated phenotype. About 38–56% of the variants in pSS regions were fixed in different groups. Many of the fixed variants, however, are likely to be neutral which might have reached fixation through hitchhiking just by being closely linked to causal mutations. Therefore, we decided to focus mainly on the pfVars viz. AA-altering, splicing, RNA structure-altering, MCE variants or those in ncRNAs. This resulted in 4,679 variants from all the pSS regions of which only 17% (n = 815) were fixed in at least one chicken group and 2% (n = 106) were fixed across the groups (Supplementary Fig. S6). We hypothesized that if a window elicited selection signal from more than one group and if variants therein were present ubiquitously and were fixed across the groups, this most likely represented old selection—possibly associated with traits that promote high production rates or better performance as a result of commercialization of the chicken or are relevant to adaptation in domesticated situations. On the other hand, if a pSS region was detected within a single group and variants were fixed only within that group, it was probably associated with group-specific traits. The major findings are discussed in the following sections.3.7.1. Ubiquitously present pfVars in the BCDO2 gene are candidates for yellow skin traitYellow skin colour is a ubiquitous feature in all Western commercial chicken.40 It has been postulated that in chicken the trait is expressed due to the presence of one or more cis-acting and tissue-specific regulatory variants that inhibit(s) the expression of the BCDO2 gene, which otherwise is responsible for degradation of carotenoid. In a previous study, Eriksson et al.40 suggested a minimum haplotype of 23.8 kb on chromosome 24 to be shared across diverse domesticated chicken breeds with yellow skin, and this haplotype is expected to harbour the causal mutation for the trait.In the present study, the 40-kb window (Chr24:6120000–6160000) that covered the minimum haplotype of yellow skin trait elicited fixation signals in all the broiler and BEL lines. Within the WEL group, however, only two of the five lines produced signal for this window and as a result it was not detected as a common pSS region from the WEL group. Closer inspection of the variants within the window revealed that there were several pfVars (n = 13), of which seven were located directly within the yellow skin haplotype and were completely fixed across all the commercial lines including the WELs (Supplementary Fig. S6). All of these variants are located either within the BCD02 gene or nearby this gene and hence can be considered as candidate causal mutations. These include: 1 intergenic-MCE, 3 intronic-MCE, 2 non-synonymous TOL and 1 UTR5' SNP that was suggestively RNA structure altering. In spite of complete fixation of these variants, the failure to detect a signal for the region from certain WEL lines suggests that the sweep region is smaller than the 40-kb window size used in this study, which is consistent with the size of shared haplotype (23.8 kb). Erriksson et al.40 speculated that the causal mutation(s) of the yellow skin trait will be within evolutionary conserved region(s) and will be regulatory in nature. Considering these, the variants within MCEs appear to be the most likely candidates.3.7.2. Ubiquitously present non-synonymous SNPs in the TSHR gene are potential causal mutations of a known sweep locusTwo recent studies have, respectively, detected and validated a strong signature of selection overlapping the TSHR gene.26,43 Although the first study speculated the gene to be associated with domestication in chicken, the later study found a more recent origin of this signature and concluded that the TSHR mutation was neither a pre-requisite nor a critical factor in domestication process; instead it is most probably related to the improvement of chickens that began during the industrial revolution. Although the causal mutation(s) within this region and its phenotypic effects are yet to be established, the biological significance of the TSHR gene on the regulation of metabolic activities and reproduction, particularly in extending the mating season, is well known.44,45 Rubin et al.26 detected a non-synonymous variation within the TSHR gene that they suspected was the causal mutation.The present study also detected a strong signal covering part of the TSHR gene from the analyses of broilers and BEL lines. Within the WEL group, four of the five lines were significant for the same TSHR window but due to failure in getting signal from a single line, it was not ultimately picked up as a common signal. About 62% (n = 221) of the variants within the gene had average frequency >0.90 suggesting a very strong selection pressure. There were only two fixed pfVars in this region though (Supplementary Fig. S6): a non-synonymous TOL mutation and a non-synonymous INTOL SNP, the same variant that had also been detected by Rubin et al.26 This INTOL variant also coincided with an MCE. Both the variants were completely fixed in all the commercial lines except in a single WEL line, although in this line the variants prevailed at high frequency (0.6–0.8). These variants were also fixed in non-commercial lines such as RI-J and inbred lines. These could therefore be the candidate causal mutations.3.7.3. The putative sweep regions show enrichment of non-coding mutations within higher frequency classesPlotting the ratio of the number of non-coding and coding variants against allele frequency reveals that there is a significant enrichment of non-coding mutations at higher frequencies compared with coding variants (P < 0.001 in <U+03C7>2 test) (Fig. 4). This is expected as non-synonymous, splicing or stop-gain/loss variants can have radical impacts on the translated protein, whereas the functional non-coding variants may be much more tolerated due their regulatory roles on gene expression.9 This is consistent with the observations from various genome-wide association studies that revealed that majority of the genetic variants associated with complex traits lie within non-coding regions of the genome.8,9Ratio of non-coding putatively functional variants (pfVars) with AA altering and splicing types at different allele frequency bins within selective sweep regions. The non-coding pfVars included intergenic, intronic, UTR and down/upstream variants from most conserved elements, variants located within known ncRNAs and variants that were predicted to alter RNA secondary structure. The graph indicates that high-frequency variants are enriched with non-coding types. BR, BEL and WEL refer to broiler, brown egg layer and white egg layer groups, respectively.Ratio of non-coding putatively functional variants (pfVars) with AA altering and splicing types at different allele frequency bins within selective sweep regions. The non-coding pfVars included intergenic, intronic, UTR and down/upstream variants from most conserved elements, variants located within known ncRNAs and variants that were predicted to alter RNA secondary structure. The graph indicates that high-frequency variants are enriched with non-coding types. BR, BEL and WEL refer to broiler, brown egg layer and white egg layer groups, respectively.Between 37 and 45% of the pSS regions across all the groups were completely devoid of genes and coincided entirely with intergenic regions and 54–70% of all the pSS regions showed fixation of only non-coding variants including intergenic, intronic, up/downstream and UTR SNPs. For instance, some of the genes found within the pSS regions were particularly enriched for fixed intronic pfVars (Supplementary Fig. S6) and most of these genes have previously been detected in other selection signature studies26,41 as well, thereby strengthening their likelihood to be within true sweep regions. It is possible that these intronic variants exert their effects through regulation or disruption of transcriptional activities, splicing efficiency of their host genes or expression of alternative transcripts.46Overlaying the known QTLs with the pSS regions reveals that the regions harbouring only non-coding fixed pfVars overlapped with QTLs of complex traits. For example, a large number of pSS regions detected in our study overlapped with QTLs for bone traits such as bone strength, bone-mineral content, bone-density, etc., suggesting a multi-gene hypothesis for regulation of these traits. Most of these pSS regions also coincided with QTLs for other traits as well, which further indicates possible pleiotropic effects of the same genes on multiple traits.47,48 Only one of the pSS regions (B-R47 in Supplementary Fig. S5) from broiler lines, however, overlapped with only bone-related QTL(s) viz. Tibia width47 and mineral density in femur bone,48 thereby allowing its closer inspection. Both the QTLs, however, were detected with only suggestive significance and as a result their effect size is expected to be small, which is an indication of involvement of regulatory causal variant(s). This pSS region overlaps with the PAPPA2 (Pappalysin 2) gene. The protein encoded by this gene cleaves the IGFBP-5 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5), which is an important stimulator of bone formation.49 Among all the variants detected from and around this gene, only non-coding SNPs reached fixation including 46 intronic, 2 upstream and 37 intergenic variants. Only one of the fixed intronic variant (Chr8:6817157) coincided with an MCE. This particular variant was found to be fixed in all the broiler and WEL lines and also in two of the five BEL lines. It is possible that this is a functional variant with a regulatory role.3.7.4. Evolutionary intolerant non-synonymous SNPs prevailing at high frequencies may confer adaptive advantageFrom the pSS regions, 11 non-synonymous INTOL variants were detected that reached fixation in one or more groups. Apart from the one INTOL SNP from the TSHR gene that has been discussed above, the other 10 variants were detected from the following genes: GCNT3 (n = 2), PLA2R1 (n = 1), FOXI1 (n = 1), ZNF507 (n = 1), ADAMTS7 (n = 1) and ENSGALG00000023731 (novel chicken gene; n = 4). Even though the pSS regions overlapping these genes were detected from specific groups (either BEL or WEL), a number of these INTOL (n = 5) variants prevailed ubiquitously at high frequency or at complete fixation in all or most of the lines irrespective of groups. Some of the variants also coincided with MCEs. Their high frequency implies that even though evolutionary intolerant, these variants possibly confer important adaptive advantages. Classic examples of genetic defects being selected as adaptive advantage includes the prevalence of certain blood-related disorders in malaria-infected regions as a means to confer resistance to the latter disease50 and the increase in frequency of the risk allele of diabetes mellitus during food scarcity in the past.51 It is, however, also possible that the fixed INTOL variants detected in the present study are not actually beneficial but have been hitchhiked to fixation with linked causal mutation.52Exploring the functions of the above genes harbouring the INTOL variants reveals that they perform a variety of functions which may be related to commercially important traits in chicken. The GCNT3 (glucosaminyl N-acetyl transferase 3, Mucin Type) gene, for instance, plays an important role in the immune system through the synthesis of mucins in mucus-secretary epithelial tissues.53 Mucin hyper-secretion can be a common response to many pathogenic infections and cancers.54 The proteins encoded by the PLA2R1 (phospholipase A2 receptor 1) gene exert various effects in different tissues including inducement of cell proliferation and production of lipid mediators by serving as a receptor of phospholipase.55 The region harbouring this gene overlapped with QTLs associated with several traits most notably for fat deposition, body weights and egg production performance. The FOXI1 (Forkhead box I1) gene codes for a transcription factor that in human is involved in the physiology of several organs viz. inner ear, testis and kidney.56 A recent study in human has detected a sweep region covering this gene and predicted that positive selection of the FOXI1 gene imparts adaptive advantage in kidney-mediated water-electrolyte homeostasis in African population in response to climatic condition.57 The pSS region covering this gene, in our study, overlapped with QTL(s) for growth, age-at-first egg and fear-related behaviour. The functions of the ZNF507 and ENSGALG00000023731 genes are not yet well studied, although ZNF507 possibly plays role in transcriptional regulations affecting multiple functions.58 The possible effect of the ADAMTS7 gene and the fixed pfVars therein is discussed in the following section.3.7.5 Broiler or layer-specific variantsAbout 12% (n = 94) of the pfVars detected from various pSS regions (Supplementary Fig. S6) were fixed exclusively in broilers while they were either undetected or segregating in layer groups indicating their possible association with broiler-related traits. Almost one-third (n = 28) of these variants resided within the largest broiler pSS region (B-R09 in Supplementary Fig. S5) on chromosome1 and represented genes: PARPBP, PMCH, NUP37, CCDC53, GNPTAB, SYCP3 and CHPT1. This region also harboured the IGF1 gene, which has known effect on growth, but the single pfVar from this gene (an intronic-MCE variant) was prevalent not only in broilers but also in layers in the present study. All these genes from B-R09 region were also detected within sweep regions in previous studies analysing commercial broiler lines.26,41The rest of the broiler-specific SNPs were either intergenic or belonged to a few genes, namely, ROBO2, AMMECR1, BMPR1B, SPRED1, MEIS2, ARFGEF2, USE-1 and MYO9B. The MYO9B (Myosin IXB) gene is interesting as, in human, variants within this gene have been found associated with inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and coeliac disease.59,60 In our study, the pSS region (B-R60 in Supplementary Fig. S5) harbouring this gene coincided with QTLs associated with antibody responses to Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis, and growth. We detected one broiler-specific non-synonymous TOL SNP and several other ubiquitously present intronic-MCE variants from this gene. Based on the information from human studies, we speculate that this gene might have roles in triggering antibody responses to E. coli and Salmonella in chicken. Moreover, being a myosin encoding gene, the broiler-specific variant(s) within this may also affect muscle growth.A number of layer-specific variants were also discovered—some of which were fixed exclusively in either BEL or WEL lines while the rest were fixed in both the layer groups. The variants fixed in both the layer groups (n = 20) came from nine genes only. Since direct effects of most of these genes are yet to be established, we investigated the overlapping QTLs to establish potential association of these genes with layer-related traits. For instance, a number of pfVars were detected from the gene ADAMTS7 (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 7) including one non-synonymous INTOL mutation. We speculate that the variants within this gene may be associated with egg-shell strength in chicken as one member of the ADAMTS gene family (ADAMTS1) has previously been shown to be up-regulated in the uterus of hens laying hard-shelled eggs compared with those laying soft-shelled eggs.61 The region harbouring the ADAMTS7 gene overlapped with QTLs for several traits including two for egg-shell strength and stiffness.62 Nevertheless, since the members of this gene family are known to perform a variety of physiological roles by encoding enzymes with protease activities, the ADAMTS7 genes may have wider effects on multiple traits.63The genes, DOCK2 (dedicator of cytokinesis 2) and GFPT2 (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2), were detected from two pSS regions on Chromosome13 and coincided with QTL(s) associated with age-at-first egg and body weight.64 Both the genes contained several layer-specific and some ubiquitous variants. Since age-at-sexual- maturation is correlated to body weight, these genes possibly have pleiotropic effects on these traits, with the fixed pfVars probably conferring later maturity in layers.A number of genes with BEL-specific variants on chromosome 6 coincided with a QTL suggestively associated with egg shell colours65 and these include: FRMPD2 (containing 1 stop-gain, 2 non-syonymous TOL and 11 intronic-MCE-SNPs), HIF1AN (1 intronic-MCE variant), MYPN (1 non-syonymous TOL SNP) and ATOH7 (2 RNA structure-altering SNPs). The brown colour of egg shell derives from a major pigment called protoporphyrin, which is secreted from the surface epithelial cells of the uterus and is deposited onto the shell.66 The shell colouration can be affected by a number of mechanisms that control either the production or precipitation of the protoporphyrin.67 One recent study has suggested that the brown and white egg layers are not dissimilar in the protoporphyrin content, but it is the control mechanism affecting the secretion and deposition of the pigment that causes the difference in egg colour.66 Although no direct evidence was found in the extant literature linking any of the above genes with egg shell colour, but the FRMPD2 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 2) appeared to be a strong candidate as a regulator of protoporphyrin precipitation. This is because it encodes a peripheral membrane protein that binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn plays important role in membrane trafficking.68,69 This gene, can therefore, play a regulatory role in the secretion and deposition of protoporphyrin on egg shell.4. Concluding remarksThis paper reports the discovery and characterization of over 15 million SNPs from the chicken genome with the goal to delineate those with potential functional consequences—either having adaptive advantage or deleterious effect. To our knowledge, this is so far the largest study of its kind on chicken not only because a huge number of variants have been detected but also because a large number of populations and individuals that have been screened. Moreover, a number of complementary approaches were adopted to identify putatively functional variants from both coding and non-coding part of the genome. By investigating local fixation in the genome, this study has also detected a number of putative sweep regions and candidate casual variants therein. This analysis has confirmed a number of previously known sweep regions such as those involving the BCDO2 gene for yellow skin colour and the TSHR gene and has identified novel regions, e.g. those potentially associated with bone strength and morphology, antibody response to E. coli and Salmonella, egg-shell colour and shell strength.In spite of the discovery of millions of SNPs, the present study failed to capture the rare and low-frequency variants (AAF < 0.05)—a major limitation of adopting Pool-seq approach with low coverage. Low-frequency variants typically represent recent mutations and are often private to specific populations. Their detection requires screening of hundreds of individuals from each population, which was beyond the scope of the present study. Unlike in human, where discovery of rare disease-causing variants has medical significance, for farm animals it is unlikely to be a priority, unless a common disease is caused by many rare variants as proposed by ‘rare allele model’.70 Instead, for farm animals the priority is to improve commercially important traits through selective breeding and unless a disease is common enough it is unlikely to be a major focus in breeding programmes. Therefore, we argue that even though, low-frequency variants could not be characterized in the present study, it is the common variants that would have major application in breeding programmes of chicken.Although the present study made efforts to characterize as many non-coding pfVars as possible using various approaches—viz. finding variants within conserved loci and known ncRNAs, predicting their effects on RNA structure and characterizing high-frequency variants within putative sweep regions—still the effort fell short due to incomplete annotation of chicken genome for functional non-coding elements. Knowledge of these elements, however, is rapidly improving due to advancements in transcriptome profiling (e.g. RNA-seq) and our predictive abilities of their functions through in silico analyses. Better characterization of these variants will therefore be possible in near future.In conclusion, it is expected that by providing a large catalogue of variants in general and potentially functional variants in particular, this study will have major implications in breeding programmes and future research in chicken in the areas of genomic selection, genome-wide association studies, fine mapping of QTL, haplotype mapping and locating candidate causal variants.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was funded by a BBSRC/DEFRA LINK grant.

This first genomic characterization of B. papendorfii provides the basis for further studies on its biology, pathogenicity and medicinal potential.1. IntroductionBipolaris is a large genus of dematiaceous hyphomycetes belonging to the order Pleosporales in the class Dothideomycetes.1 It is closely related to two other genera, Cochliobolus and Curvularia. The taxonomy of these three genera has caused confusion for many mycologists as their sexual and asexual states have undergone several nomenclatural changes.2 Manamgoda et al.3 showed that Cochliobolus species can be separated broadly into two subgroups, one with Bipolaris species and another with Curvularia species. Although Bipolaris and Curvularia share many morphological similarities including the same teleomorph of Cochliobolus, some species demonstrate intermediate morphology and some Bipolaris species cluster phylogenetically with Curvularia species instead of with other Bipolaris species.3Bipolaris species have been frequently isolated from soil, plant debri, as well as living plants on which they may exist as saprophytes or phytopathogens. The fungal genus Bipolaris has a asexual state named Cochliobolus are notorious for causing devastating disease epidemics of crop plants such as maize, oat, wheat, rice and sorghum,4–6 leading to problems of starvation, malnutrition and world economic crisis.4,5 Some plant pathogens such as Bipolaris australiensis, Bipolaris hawaiiensis and Bipolaris spicifera occasionally cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans,7 manifesting as allergic or chronic, superficial or deep-seated, localized or disseminated infections.8Bipolaris papendorfii has received little attention, compared with other virulent species that are pathogenic in food crops and humans. It is a rare opportunistic pathogen that has been reported in only three cases of keratitis.8 Like other plant pathogenic Bipolaris species, it causes corn leaf spot,9 but the underlying pathogenic mechanism is totally unclear. More interestingly, a recent report described two bioactive compounds, hamigerone and radicinol, from B. papendorfii that exhibited anti-proliferative activity in various cancer cells.10 Both of these compounds also activated the apoptosis pathway by regulating the expression of BCL-2, caspase 3 and p53.10The development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) has provided massive genomic nucleotide sequence data for the study of microbes. Although there are whole genome sequence data for several Cochliobolus species in international databases,6 the whole genome sequence of B. papendorfii has not yet been determined. The genetic fundamental and basic biology of this fungus are largely unknown. In this study, we report the de novo draft genome sequence of B. papendorfii UM 226 that was isolated from the skin scraping of a patient with dermatomycosis. The draft genome was generated by a hybrid assembly of Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies to improve genome assembly. To our knowledge, this report is the first detailed description of the B. papendorfii genome. It should provide useful information on the biology, pathogenicity and medicinal potential of this fungus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics statementThe isolate used in this study was obtained from an archived fungal collection. All labels on the source sample have been erased with the exception of sample type and clinical diagnosis. Thus, there is no information traceable back to the patient from whom the isolate was obtained. As such, this genomic study is exempt from ethical approval in our teaching hospital. (http://www.ummc.edu.my/view/content.php?ID=VGxSWlBRPT0=).2.2. Fungal isolateUM 226 was isolated from the skin scraping of a patient with suspected dermatomycosis in the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The isolate was processed according to the laboratory's standard operating procedures (SOP)11 with direct wet mount microscopy followed by inoculation on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) for incubation at 30°C up to 7 days, with alternate day examination for fungal growth. Macroscopic examination was carried out to observe colonial characteristics, including color, texture and topography. Tease mount and slide culture were performed to identify the arrangement of conidia and conidiophores. The isolate was viewed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine wall ornamentation and fine surface features of fungal conidia.2.3. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysisThe internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) and large subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene (LSU) were used as targets for molecular identification of the fungal isolate. Total DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing were performed as described previously.11 The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Annealing temperatures used to amplify ITS, SSU and LSU genes were 58, 52 and 46°C, respectively. The sequenced data were subjected to BLASTn search against the non-redundant (nr) NCBI-nucleotide database for fungal identification. Unique ITS, SSU and LSU sequences from the isolate, together with an additional 145 species of Cochliobolus, Bipolaris and Curvularia and an outgroup strain of Alternaria brassicicola (Supplementary Table S2) were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignments of collected ITS, LSU and SSU sequences were generated using M-Coffee.12 Individual alignments were concatenated for Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis partitioned by gene. Bayesian tree analyses were performed using MrBayes v3.2.113 with reversible jump MCMC averaging over the entire general time reversible (GTR) rates and gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity for all subsets of partitioned scheme. A total of 5,000,000 generations were run with a sampling frequency of 100, and diagnostics were calculated for every 1,000 generations. The first 12,500 trees were discarded with burn-in setting of 25%. Convergence was assessed with a standard deviation of split frequencies below 0.01, no obvious trend for the plot of the generation versus the log probability of the data, and the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) close to 1.0 for all parameters.2.4. Genomic DNA extractionGenomic DNA was extracted from fresh fungal mycelia in accordance with the protocol of Moslem et al.14 with slight modification. Briefly, mycelia were scraped off from the agar surface and crushed into fine powder with liquid nitrogen. One gram of crushed fungal powder was suspended in 6 ml of DNA extraction buffer [200 mM Tris–HCl, (pH 8.5), 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 0.6% (w/v) SDS] in a 50-ml centrifuge tube and incubated at 65°C for 10 min. Next, 1.4 ml of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.3) was added to the mixture and followed by incubation at 80°C for 20 min. The tube was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was transferred into a new 50-ml centrifuge tube. Genomic DNA was then precipitated with equal volume of 100% (v/v) isopropanol. Genomic DNA was washed from the pellet by adding 500 µl of ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol and finally dissolved in nuclease-free distilled water. The purified genomic DNA was treated with RNAase at 37°C for overnight. Then, the mixture was incubated at 65°C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 28,433 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The quantity and quality of the extracted genomic DNA were determined using NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).2.5. Genome sequencing and de novo hybrid assemblyIllumina library was prepared using TruSeq v3 Reagent Kits (Illumina). UM 226 genomic DNA was sheared into smaller fragments by Covaris S/E210 or Bioruptor. The 500-bp fragments were purified though gel electrophoresis, which then selectively enriched and amplified by PCR. Next, qualified sequencing library were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer (Illumina) with 2 × 90 bp paired-end mode.PacBio RS sequencing was performed using the PacBio RS II system (Pacific Biosciences). UM 226 genomic DNA was used for 10-kb library preparation using PacBio DNA Template Prep Kit 2.0 (3–10 kb). SMRTbell templates were then annealed using PacBio DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P4. Three SMRT cells were used for sequencing with MagBead standard Seq v2 collection protocol using 180-min movies.Genome assembly was performed using the hybrid approach using ECtools15 with Illumina contigs and PacBio long reads. Illumina short reads were first pre-processed trimming bases with a Phred quality below Qv20 from the 3' end of the reads, retaining reads = 50 bp and reads with 40% bases having Qv =20 were filtered out using FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). The pre-processed reads were corrected using Quake software16 with 16-mer setting. Corrected reads were then assembled into preliminary contigs using Velvet version 1.2.0715 with k-mer setting = 57, scaffolding = no, insert_length = 462 and ins_length_sd = 60.ECTools then utilize velvet assembled contigs with length =500 bp to correct errors of the PacBio long reads. Error corrected long reads were then assembled using Celera assembler.17 Both ECTools and Celebra assembly were performed according to the software instruction with default parameters setting. Celera assembled contigs smaller than 10 kb were discarded, and Quiver was used to polish the remaining contigs. The assembly was imported into SMRT analysis software version 2.1.1 through SMRT portal interface as the reference, and three SMRT cells data generated were aligned to the genome using the RS_Resequencing protocol iteratively. Through the polishing steps, low-quality contigs with low coverage information from Quiver output were discarded from the final assembly.2.6. Gene prediction and annotationProtein coding sequences of B. papendorfii UM 226 were predicted using GeneMark-ES version 2.3e.18 Annotation of coding sequences for UM 226 was completed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches against the NCBI nr protein and SwissProt databases. Gene Ontology and KEGG metabolic pathways matches were carried out using local BLAST2GO tools.19 Protein classifications were performed by EuKaryotic Orthologous Group (KOG).20 The total number of predicted proteins involved in post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (KOG annotation for other Cochliobolus species) was obtained from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) website, http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/. Protein domain families were matched to Pfam database using InterProScan 5.21 Individual rRNA and tRNA sequences were identified using RNAmmer v1.222 and tRNAscan-SE v1.3.1,23 respectively. Putative transposable elements were identified using Transposon-PSI (http://transposonpsi.sourceforge.net).Carbohydrate-Active enzymes (CAZymes) were functionally annotated by submitting the predicted protein models to the databases of automated Carbohydrate-active enzyme ANnotation (dbCAN).24 Small secreted proteins were identified by the prediction of cleavage sites and signal peptide/non-signal peptide using SignalP version 4.125 after discarding proteins with transmembrane domains that were determined by TMHMM version 2.0.26 However, one transmembrane domain located at in the N-terminal 40 amino acids is allowed, because the domain is responsible to the secretion signal. Genomic mapping of fungal secondary metabolite clusters was performed using web-based SMURF (Secondary Metabolite Unknown Regions Finder) (www.jcvi.org/smurf/).27 Amino acid sequences with e-value threshold =1e-5, alignment length over 70% of its own length and over 50% match identity were selected and assigned as the annotation of predicted genes.2.7. Orthologous genes and comparative genomic analysisThe protein sequences of all current publicly available Cochliobolus genomes (Cochliobolus heterostrophus C5,6,28,29C. heterostrophus C4,4,30,31C. carbonum 26-R-13,6,29C. victoriae FI3,6,29C. miyabeanus ATCC 44560,6,29C. sativus ND90Pr4,30,31 and C. lunatus m11829) were used to determine the orthologous genes in B. papendorfii UM 226. The genome sequences of the seven Cochliobolus species were downloaded from JGI. The OrthoMCL version 2.0232 was used in the analysis of protein sequences clustering (=33 amino acids) for B. papendorfii UM 226 and the seven genome references by all-against-all BLASTp searches of all proteins. The reciprocal best hits from distinct genomes were identified as orthologous genes.2.8. Phylogenomic analysisA phylogenomic tree was built using all proteome clusters of the seven Cochliobolus species generated from comparative analysis. The tree is rooted with A. brassicicola ATCC 96836 as outgroup. A total of 6,051 single-copy orthologous genes containing one member in each species was subjected to individual sequence alignments using ClustalW version 2.0.33 All spurious sequences or poorly aligned regions were discarded with trimAL (with –gt 0.5). The filtered multiple alignments were then concatenated into a superalignment with 2,991,675 characters. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was run using MrBayes v3.2.1 with mixed amino acid model, gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites. The MCMC was run using a sampling frequency of 100 for 100,000 generations with a burn-in setting of 25%.2.9. Prediction of secondary structure and homology modellingPSIPRED v3.330 was used to predict the secondary structure of the LysM domains. Three-dimensional structural models of the LysM domains were generated using SWISS-MODEL server.31 Amino acid sequence alignment between UM226_683 domains and Ecp6 was performed using ClustalW version 2.0. The template used in this modelling was selected from template identification function in the SWISS-MODEL program. In this study, a Cladosporium fulvum LysM effector Ecp6 (Protein Data Bank entry 4b8v)34 was selected as the template. The predicted models were stored as a PDB output file, and the structures were visualized by Swiss-PdbViewer 4.0.1.35 The quality of the protein model generated was validated by using the PROCHECK program as described previously.362.10. Mating type locus identification and phylogenetic analysisMAT1-2 mating type regions immediately 5 kb upstream and downstream were retrieved from the sequenced genome using Artemis v12.0 sequence viewer.37 Bayesian tree analysis was carried out by using a procedure similar to ribosomal molecular identification with 500,000 generations run. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MAT1-2 nucleotide sequences from B. papendorfii UM 226, together with additional nine species of Cochliobolus and Bipolaris. The tree is rooted with Alternaria alternata as outgroup.3. Results and discussion3.1. Morphological and molecular identificationThe B. papendorfii UM 226 colonies on SDA were fast growing, velvety and compact with abundant short aerial mycelium (Fig. 1a). The surface of the colonies was initially grayish white to olivaceous green and becomes black with a raised grayish periphery after being cultured for 7 days (Fig. 1a). It had a black-green coloration on the reverse side (Fig. 1b). The diameter of the colony was 60 mm after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. Microscopic morphology demonstrated simple or flexuose branched, pale to medium brown conidiophores (up to 200 µm long, 4–9 µm wide) with zig-zag rachis bearing conidium in a sympodial pattern (Fig. 1c). Conidiogenous nodes were verruculose, distinct, swollen and up to 5 µm wide (Fig. 1d). The conidia (24–40 × 10–20 µm) were curved, kidney shaped or obpyriform (Fig. 1c). The conidia had three pseudoseptates with the widest at the second cell from the base. SEM observation demonstrated typical, roughed, zig-zag conidiophores with several conidia (Fig. 1e). Unlike other Bipolaris spp. that have typical smooth walled conidia,8 the SEM microphotograph of the UM 226 conidia showed that they were verrucose walled with thickenings at places of pseudosepta (Fig. 1e). On the basis of these characteristics, the UM 226 clinical isolate was found to be morphologically related to B. papendorfii.8Colonial characteristic and microscopic morphology of Bipolaris papendorfii UM 226.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The preliminary morphological identification of the UM 226 isolate was confirmed by PCR amplification of the ITS, SSU and LSU gene regions, which yielded specific amplicons of ~540 (ITS), 1,200 (SSU) and 900 bp (LSU), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). The sequenced data were used to construct a phylogram using combined gene analysis with the additional 145 ex-type strains of Cochliobolus, Bipolaris and Curvularia spp. (Fig. 2). As previously noted,2 the phylogenetic tree analysis separated the Curvularia, Bipolaris and Cochliobolus species into two major, well-supported groups: Groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the combined dataset of the three loci revealed that 59 species were clustered in Group 1 and 87 species were clustered in Group 2. Group 1 consisted of Bipolaris and Cochliobolus spp. while Group 2 comprised species of Curvularia, Bipolaris and Cochliobolus. All the plant pathogenic and economically important fungi are identified in genus Bipolaris, which were grouped into Group 1.2 The Bipolaris species that clustered in Group 2 (Fig. 2). Multilocus phylogenetic analysis revealed that UM 226 was clustered together with B. papendorfii strain CMON22 in Group 2 (Fig. 2). Based on the morphological examination and multigene phylogeny, the isolate was identified as B. papendorfii. Bayesian phylogram generated based on combined genes of ITS, SSU and LSU sequenced data.

Genome features of B. papendorfii UM 226In this study, Illumina HiSeq 2000 and PacBio sequencing technologies were used to produce hybrid genome assembly for B. papendorfii UM 226. The total assembly size of B. papendorfii UM 226 genome is 33.4 Mb. The sequencing reads were assembled into 374 contigs with an N50 contig size of 146,099 kb. Hybrid assembly of B. papendorfii UM 226 showed a lower number of contigs and a higher N50 value (Table 1). Summary of the sequence statistics is presented in Table 1. The genome had an average G + C content of 50.65%. Genome statistics of Bipolaris papendorfii UM 226Genome statistics of Bipolaris papendorfii UM 2263.3. Transposable elementsTransposable elements (TEs), also known as jumping genes, were important in the variability, gene structure and evolution of the genome. Recently, Santana et al.38 demonstrated that C. heterostrophus race O genome (~36 Mb) harbours 5.9% of TEs. Here, our bioinformatics prediction revealed that 2.49% (831,552 bp) of the assembled genome of B. papendorfii UM 226 consisted of TEs (Table 2). The transposable elements of Class I, retrotransposons comprised 2.31% of the genome, whereas Class II transposable elements, DNA transposons comprised only 0.19% of the genome. LINE (Long Interspersed Nuclear Element)- and LTR (Long Terminal Repeat)-type retrotransposons are mostly presented in the fungal genomes.39,40 Gypsy and Copia elements are the LTR superfamilies that widely distributed in these genomes. As previously noted,38 Gypsy elements were identified to be located upstream of the PKS1, OXI1 and LAM1 genes, downstream of PKS2 gene as well as between the RED2 and RED3 genes in the C. heterostrophus race O genome; Copia element was located downstream of the TOX9 gene in the genome. In this study, our analysis showed that 0.24, 0.67 and 0.29% of the sequenced B. papendorfii UM 226 genome, estimated 33.4 Mb, consists of LINE, gypsy and TY1_Copia, respectively. However, the locations of these TEs in the genome remain unknown at this stage of knowledge. The most predominant TE families, both in terms of number of copies and element size, are DDE_1 transposases (Table 2). The DDE_1 transposases contain a functional domain to mediate DNA-binding, protein–protein interaction and ‘cut-and-paste’ activities.41 The DDE domain has been identified in all eukaryotic cut-and-paste TEs, suggesting their common evolutionary origin.42Putative transposable elements in the genome sequence of Bipolaris papendorfii UM 226Putative transposable elements in the genome sequence of Bipolaris papendorfii UM 2263.4. Gene predictionOur pipeline showed that there are 128 tRNAs, 12 5S rRNA, 3 18S rRNA and 3 28S rRNA in the genomic sequence. In addition, the B. papendorfii UM 226 genome revealed a total of 11,015 putative coding DNA sequences (CDS) with an average gene length of 1,425 bp. Gene density of protein coding genes is 3.29 genes/10 kb. The genome size of B. papendorfii UM 226, number of predicted genes and gene density are comparable to the previously sequenced Cochliobolus species genomes (Supplementary Table S3). On average, there are 2.95 exons per gene. A total of 10,708, 6,963 and 8,283 gene-coding sequences are homologous to currently available proteins in the NCBI nr, SwissProt and InterPro databases with 7,759 hypothetical proteins identified based on the top hit of the BLAST result against NCBI nr database. The large amount of hypothetical proteins in the genome indicated the uniqueness of B. papendorfii isolate.To further characterize the predicted proteins, the genome was mapped to KOG and KEGG databases. All the proteins were ascribed to 26 different functional groups based on KOG classification (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S4). Apart from the poorly characterized categories: categories [R] General functions prediction only, [S] Function unknown and [X] Unnamed protein, the top five KOG groups they were annotated in were [O] Post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (512 genes), [T] Signal transduction mechanisms (396 genes), [I] Lipid transport and metabolism (382 genes), [C] Energy production and conversion (344 genes) and [Q] Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (334 genes) (Fig. 3a). Like other Cochliobolus species [C. heterostrophus C4 (560 copies), C. heterostrophus C5 (608 copies), C. victoriae F13 (597 copies), C. sativus ND90Pr (585 copies), C. carbonum 26-R-13 (597 copies), C. lunatus m118 (587 copies)] that have been previously sequenced by JGI, the majority of the genes in B. papendorfii UM 226 genome was involved in post-translational modifications (Fig. 3a). Post-translational modifications of proteins regulate a wide variety of basic cellular functions in fungi, such as cellular growth, adaptive and developmental processes.43 Autophagy plays a vital role in cellular growth, degradation as well as cell survival in filamentous fungi, especially in starvation condition.44 Interestingly, we identified 103 putative serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in autophagy from the KOG group O (Supplementary Table S4). Moreover, various fungal cell surface proteins post-translationally modified in fungi are involved in fungal virulence.43 To gain insight into the gene functions, we managed to assign 3,074 predicted proteins to their orthologous genes in the KEGG database. At the first glance, there were 1,125 predicted proteins of B. papendorfii UM 226 involved in metabolic pathways in the KEGG database (Supplementary Table S5). The top five categories in KEGG metabolic pathway are carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism (Fig 3b). There are 293 unique reactions corresponding to carbohydrate metabolism. This result suggests that there are enriched carbohydrate mechanisms such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and citrate cycle (TCA cycle), that can facilitate the use of diverse substrates of B. papendorfii UM 226 in exposure to various carbohydrate sources in the environment.

The CAZymes familyAll types of CAZymes, especially plant cell wall degrading enzymes, are commonly produced by fungal plant pathogens to penetrate the rigid barrier of the plant cell wall.45 Most of the fungal CAZymes were known to degrade plant cell wall materials to obtain carbon source for fungal growth as well as for penetration and infection of their host plants.45 As B. papendorfii has been reported to cause corn infection,9 the B. papendorfii UM 226 genome was mapped to the CAZy database to determine the presence of CAZyme-coding homologous genes. A total of 728 putative CAZyme-coding homologous genes were determined in the genome. This comprises 122 with auxiliary activities (AA), 69 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), 150 carbohydrate esterases (CE), 266 glycoside hydrolases (GH), 104 glycosyl transferases (GT) and 17 polysaccharide lyases (PL) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S6). The number of GH, GT and PL family candidates identified are comparable to the several reported in several studies for necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic Cochliobolus species.28,45 The number of GHs in C. heterostrophus C4, C. heterostrophus C5 and C. sativus ND90Pr are 276, 292 and 272, respectively; the number of GTs in C. heterostrophus C4, C. heterostrophus C5 and C. sativus ND90Pr are 96, 103 and 99, respectively; the number of PLs in C. heterostrophus C4, C. heterostrophus C5 and C. sativus ND90Pr are 15, 15 and 15, respectively.28,44 Interestingly, the B. papendorfii UM 226 genome contains a higher number of CE-coding gene homologs (150 copies) compared with that of the reported Cochliobolus species, such as C. heterostrophus C4 (46 copies), C. heterostrophus C5 (49 copies) and C. sativus ND90Pr (47 copies).28,45 Our findings revealed that the fungus has 12 of the 16 CE families, with family CE2, CE6, CE11 and CE13 missing. The high number of CE1 (42 copies) and CE10 (57 copies) indicated that B. papendorfii UM 226 might produce many putative plant degrading enzymes containing carboxylesterase and endo-1,4-ß-xylanase activities, respectively.45 CE1 and CE10 members were reported to have a wide range of substrate specificities. CE1 and CE10 are hemicellulose-targeting CEs.46,47 In this study, we identified seven copies of putative endo-1,4-ß-xylanases, which are responsible to degrade the 1,4-glycosidic bond and thus depolymerize the xylan polymer (a major carbohydrate component of hemicellulose) into its monomer constituents (Supplementary Table S6).48 Our result also demonstrated a high number of GH and AA genes, postulating the ability of our fungal isolate to degrade lignocellulose, which is a main structural constituent of non-woody or woody plants. A total of 16 putative ligninolytic genes: multicopper oxidase (6 copies) and heme peroxidase (10 copies) were identified in this work.49,50 Multicopper oxidases and heme peroxidases involved in lignin degradation by oxidizing lignin subunits using molecular oxygen (electron acceptor) and extracellular hydrogen peroxide (co-substrate), respectively.48,49 Collectively, B. papendorfii UM 226 possesses a wide array of CAZymes that are involved in the degradation of the complex carbohydrates in the plant cell walls.

Comparative genomics of B. papendorfii UM 226 and other Cochliobolus speciesIn this work, we selected seven publicly available Cochliobolus species genomes and an A. brassicicola genome for rooting the phylogenomic tree (Fig. 5). A total of 101,438 proteins were clustered into 14,296 orthologous clusters with 6,051 single-copy orthologous genes determined. It should be noted that B. papendorfii UM 226 was tightly clustered with C. lunatus m118. Among the 14,296 gene family clusters, 222 gene families were conserved between B. papendorfii UM 226 and C. lunatus m118. In agreement with the multilocus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2), these data showed a close evolutionary relationship between B. papendorfii UM 226 and Curvularia species, which are separated from all plant pathogenic Cochliobolus (anamorph Bipolaris) species (Fig. 5).

Number at the node referring to Bayesian posterior probability. The tree is rooted with Alternaria brassicicola ATCC 96836 as outgroup.Whole proteome alignment of the B. papendorfii UM 226 and the seven Cochliobolus gene contents indicated that B. papendorfii UM 226 contained 37 gene family clusters composed of 83 unique genes. All of these unique genes encode for hypothetical proteins or unknown proteins with no apparent homologs to the currently existing gene sequences deposited in NCBI nr and SwissProt databases. Protein domain analysis revealed that seven of the family clusters were related to resistance-associated proteins, retrotransposon, peptidoglycan-binding function, hydrolytic functions, aspartic peptidase and DNA-binding function (Table 3). Among them, particular attention was paid to a hypothetical protein (UM226_638) with multiple lysin motifs (LysMs) domains. Based on the CAZyme annotation, UM226_638 hypothetical protein belongs to the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM50) of CAZyme which is involved in the degradation of chitin or peptidoglycan. Fungal LysM effectors had been shown to have chitin-binding affinity to perturb chitin-induced immunity from their host plant.51 A novel virulence factor with LysM domains, known as Ecp6 effector, was well characterized from the tomato pathogenic fungus C. fulvum.52 The presence of LysM domains in Ecp6 effector was postulated to protect fungal cell walls from plant chitinases hydrolysis by competing with host receptors for chitin.52 As previously noted,52 the LysMs-containing UM226_638 protein belongs to type A fungal LysM protein (PF01467) and contains three LysM domains. Many of the type A LysM proteins play an important role in infection process.53 For convenient description hereafter, these three domains were assigned as LysM domain I (75–118 amino acids), LysM domain II (338–384 amino acids) and LysM domain III (454–502 amino acids) (Fig. 6a). Unlike C. fulvum secreted Ecp6,38,39 we found that the UM226_638 protein do not have a signal peptide for secretion. Thus, UM226_638 protein might not be a secreted protein. Moreover, secondary structure prediction showed that only LysM domain II and domain III have a ßaaß secondary structure (Fig. 6b). On the contrary, LysM domain I composed of three a-helices and a ß-sheet (Fig. 6b).

The N- and C-terminal ends are labelled.Tertiary structures of the LysM domain II and LysM domain III were then generated by using the SWISS-MODEL server based on the experimentally solved structural homolog. As previously reported,38,39 the three-dimensional structural prediction showed that the domains comprised two a-helices packed on the same side of the anti-parallel two ß-sheets (Fig. 6c, panel 1 and 2). The molecular surface of the third LysM domain of UM226_638 was computed (Fig. 6c, panel 3). In consistent with the structural homology of C. fulvum Ecp6,52 a shallow groove was observed in the LysM domain III that provides a binding site for chitin oligomers. Accuracy of the domain models generated was verified by PROCHECK program, a protein structure validation program (data not shown). The stereochemical parameters were all indicated to be within the acceptable limit, and it can serve as a good hypothetical domain structures for further functional study. Taken together, the putative unique LysMs-containing UM226_638 protein might be a fungal avirulence protein that involved in fungal virulence on its host.3.7. Sexual reproductionSexual reproduction is well characterized for most of the known Cochliobolus species.29 In Cochliobolus species, a single mating type locus (MAT) was important to regulate sexual development and production of sexual spores.54 The coexistence of heterothallic and homothallic species are common in the genus of Cochliobolus. Thus, sexual Cochliobolus species can be either heterothallic fungi that require two strains of opposite mating type to participate in the sexual process (MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 gene) or homothallic fungi that carry both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genes.29 In this study, we successfully identified a putative MAT1-2 (UM226_825) gene but no MAT1-1 gene in the UM 226 genome. UM226_825 shared a homology (81% identical) and domain architecture (DNA domain of the high mobility group, HMG domain) with the MAT-2 from Curvularia ellisii. The structural organization of 12 kb at the B. papendorfii UM 226 MAT1-2 region was examined (Fig. 7a). As previously described,6,54 three other putative genes have been identified adjacent to the MAT1-2: (i) a ß-glucosidase homolog gene (3' flank of MAT1-2), (ii) a homolog of a yeast gene (ORF1) with unknown function (5' flank of MAT1-2) and (iii) a GTPase-activating homolog gene (5' flank of MAT1-2) (Fig. 7a). However, these genes were not involved in sexual reproduction.54 Turgeon et al.54 showed that the MAT1-2 gene evolved at a faster rate than other nucleotide sequences in the genome of Cochliobolus species. In this study, a phylogenetic tree was built to reveal evolutionary relationships between B. papendorfii and other related species (Fig. 7b). MAT1-2 genes from three homothallic fungi and six heterothallic fungi were included in the analysis (Supplementary Table S7). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the MAT1-2 genes can be divided into two groups, which agree well with the tree previously discussed (Fig. 2). B. papendorfii MAT1-2 is tightly clustered together with the MAT1-2 of heterothallic C. ellisii, which are separated from another group that consisted of virulent plant pathogens. The close relationship of asexual B. papendorfii to the sexual C. ellisii suggests that B. papendorfii can also be reproduced sexually in field. MAT1-2 gene of Bipolaris papendorfii UM 226.

They are the source of medicinal biologically active compounds. They are also notorious mycotoxins that cause diseases on plants, animals and humans. Armed with the knowledge that secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes often occur in clusters with a key backbone gene.55 In this study, we used SMURF prediction to annotate potential gene cluster backbone enzymes in the B. papendorfii UM 226 genome. There are 32 gene clusters encoding core enzymes, including 19 genes encoding polyketide synthase (PKS) or PKS-like, 11 genes encoding non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) or NRPS-like, a gene encoding polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid (PKS-NRPS) and a gene encoding dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS), that are important for the biosynthesis of melanin, bioactive compounds and mycotoxins. The only DMATS gene identified in B. papendorfii UM 226 is UM226_1500 (48% identical), which is often involved in the first committed step of ergot alkaloids biosynthesis.56 Ergot alkaloids are mycotoxins but also important natural pharmaceuticals for human use.57Like most Cochliobolus plant pathogens reported,6B. papendorfii UM 226 is enriched with multidomain NRPS encoding genes (NPS) and PKS genes. NPS2 (UM226_2338, 74% identical), NPS6 (UM226_3398, 87% identical), NPS4 (UM226_5568, 82% identical) and NPS10 (UM226_3258, 93% identical) orthologous genes found in B. papendorfii UM 226 were reported to be conserved across all Cochliobolus species.29 NPS2, NPS6, NPS4 and NPS10 harbour multiple domains, including AMP-binding domain, condensation domain, phosphopantetheine-binding domain and amino acid adenylation domain. NPS2 is likely responsible for the synthesis of siderophore and intracellular iron storage.28 All of the reported Cochliobolus pathogens are necrotrophs, which produce Host Selective Toxins (HSTs) to infect cereal crops.58 Like C. carbonum (Bipolaris zeicola), B. papendorfii has been reported to cause Corn Leaf Spot disease.9 Thus, it is not surprising that B. papendorfii UM 226 contains genes encoding HST. Interestingly, UM226_5568 shared a homology (69% identical) with the HC-toxin synthetase from Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (strain Pt-1C-BFP). As noted previously,6 the NPS4 encoded by UM226_5568 might be responsible for producing HC-toxin. In addition, four putative HC-toxin efflux carrier TOXAs were identified in the genome, including UM226_2212 (77% identical), UM226_5722 (74% identical), UM226_9947 (55% identical) and UM226_6817 (50% identical). These putative HC-toxin efflux carrier TOXAs have a potential role in self-protection against secreted HC-toxin.Melanin production, a hallmark of dematiaceous fungi, is responsible for the protection of the fungi from UV irradiation, high temperatures as well as oxidants.59PKS18, encoding a PKS for melanin biosynthesis, is conserved in all Cochliobolus plant pathogens.29 However, this PKS18 gene was not identified in B. papendorfii UM 226, implying that that there must be other genes, such as PKS1 (UM226_1411, 93% identical), PKS2 (UM226_3388, 84% identical), PKS4 (UM226_8230, 79% identical), PKS7 (UM226_6241, 65% identical), PKS9 (UM226_7130, 77% identical) and PKS11 (UM226_7830, 85% identical) that can be responsible for melanin biosynthesis. Among these, PKS1 (UM226_1411), BRN1 (UM226_1408, 98%) and transcription factor CMR1 (UM226_1409, 84%) are located in a close group, and their mutual orientation is the same as found in C. heterostrophus and A. brassicicola.60 Moreover, two important melanin biosynthetic genes, scytalone dehydratases (SCD1), UM226_59, (98% identical) and UM226_7826 (65% identical), were identified. PKS1, BRN1 and SCD1 are the key enzymes involved in the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) biosynthesis pathway for the melanin biosynthesis.60 Transcription factor CMR1 plays an important role to control BRN1 and SCD1 genes expression during melanin production.61 Eliahu et al.60 indicated that the expression of CMR1 is regulated by two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) known as Mps1 and Chk1 for normal pigmentation; both enzymes were found in our genome. Two Mps1 (UM226_10400, 95% identical and UM226_10401, 93% identical) and two Chk1 (UM226_10509, 87% identical and UM226_10016, 50% identical) were identified. Overall, these findings suggested that like most of the dematiaceous fungi, melanin is biosynthesized via the DHN-melanin pathway, which is mediated by the transcription factor CMR1 and two signaling components, Mps1 and Chk1.Terpenoids, also referred to as isoprenoids, are a diverse and the largest group of natural bioactive compounds. Many terpenoids such as the anticancer drug paclitaxel and the antimalarial drug Artemisinin are well recognized for human disease therapy.62 In this study, we identified 10 core enzymes involved in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S8). The enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase are encoded by two and four copies of the genes, respectively. The remaining eight enzymes are encoded by single-copy genes. Taken together, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in B. papendorfii UM 226 might occur mainly through the MVA pathway.Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), a purine alkaloid, which is one of the world's most popular psychoactive drug in pharmaceuticals, with an estimated consumption of 120,000 tons worldwide per year.63 Caffeine is a large environmental concern because of the production of millions tons of caffeine-containing waste products every year. There are few publication about microorganisms capable of caffeine degradation have been isolated from different environments.64,65 Sauer et al.66 indicated that caffeine was degraded by cytochrome P450 enzymes in yeast, postulating that the catabolic pathway might be more similar to that in animals. In this work, we searched the B. papendorfii UM226 genome for potential genes involved in caffeine metabolism. Two cytochrome P450 enzymes (UM226_867, 78% identical and UM226_7104, 39% identical) were identified in the genome based on the KEGG metabolic pathway analysis. In addition, we also found two cytochrome P450 2E1 (UM226_1044, 81% identical and UM226_4157, 79% identical) that catalyze caffeine metabolism via N-demethylation pathway in human liver cells. The production of methylxanthines during the course of caffeine degradation can be further converted to the methyluric acids by xanthine oxidase.64 In this work, two xanthine oxidases (UM226_7607, 92% identical and UM226_7880, 86% identical) were found in the B. papendorfii UM 226 genome. Moreover, we also identified an uricase (UM226_10622, 83% identical) that might responsible to convert free xanthine into simpler compounds.64 This suggests that B. papendorfii UM 226 may be a potential caffeine-resistant strain of fungus.In this study, we successfully generated a high-quality draft genome sequence of B. papendorfii UM 226 using hybrid assembly of Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies. This is the first genome assembly of B. papendorfii, which allows us to carry out phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that B. papendorfii UM 226 tightly clustered with C. lunatus m118, which is consistent with the multilocus phylogenetic analysis. However, at this stage of knowledge, the long standing confusion in the taxonomic grouping of Bipolaris, Curvularia and Cochliobolus remains unsolved. In this work, we identified a unique gene encoding LysM-containing protein. The LysM-containing protein has three LysM domains which are predicted to bind chitin to perturb chitin-induced immunity from the host. Furthermore, B. papendorfii UM226 are enriched with putative DMAT, PKS and NRPS encoding genes. The presence of these key enzymes will serve as a landmark for future discovery of bioactive molecules as well as mycotoxins. We hope that the dissection of the B. papendorfii UM226 genome sequence and in-depth analysis of the genome content will help to decipher its basic biology and provide a valuable platform for future fungal research.4.

IntroductionNatural antisense transcripts (NATs) are endogenous transcripts that can form double-stranded RNAs with other transcripts according to the base complementary rule. They can be grouped into two categories: cis-NATs and trans-NATs, based on whether they work on cis or trans. Cis-NATs are transcribed from the same genomic locus as their sense transcripts but from the opposite DNA strand, and display perfect sequence complementarity. Whereas, trans-NATs are transcribed from separate genomic loci and typically form partial complementarity.1 Moreover, cis-NATs can be categorized into four subtypes: head-to-head (divergent), tail-to-tail (convergent), fully containing overlap (enclosed) and nearby (nearby head-to-head and nearby tail-to-tail) depending upon their relative orientation and degree of overlap.2Various techniques and methods have been applied to identify NATs from transcriptome data. However, different methods and criteria to scrutinize the data get different results. A review by Werner and Berdal3 indicated that ~22, 15 and 15% genes could form NATs in human, mouse and fly, respectively. But these values are increased to 40.7, 40.9 and 25.6% in a report of Zhang et al.4 The rice and Arabidopsis genome have around 6 and 9% NAT genes.3 Wang et al.5 detected 1,340 potential cis-NAT pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana, including 957 cis-NAT pairs that were certified by massive parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) expression data. However, in this paper, a genome-wide method was used to identify NATs comprehensively, and it was found that 7,962 (23.9%) genes of A. thaliana could form NAT pairs, including 4,080 cis-NAT pairs and 2,491 trans-NAT pairs.NATs have been proposed to play important roles, especially in regulating the expression of their target genes at several levels, including transcription,6 mRNA processing, splicing,7 RNA stability,8 cellular transport and translational regulation.9 Nowadays, more and more studies have focused on the role of plants NATs in post-transcription regulation. For example, Borsani et al.10 demonstrated that the pair of cis-NAT SRO5 and P5CDH has an antagonistic function in the regulation of salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. The overlapping region of this NAT pair can produce a 24 nucleotides (nt) siRNA, which could cause post-transcriptional silencing of P5CDH through cleavage. The fragment of cleaved P5CDH could then be used by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to produce secondary dsRNA, which is subsequently processed by DCL1 to generate the secondary 21nt siRNA, which can also target P5CDH. Endogenous siRNAs from NATs are referred to as ‘natural antisense transcript siRNAs’ (NAT-siRNAs). In plants, the specific siRNAs that derived from the cleavage of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed by the overlapping region of the cis-NATs (termed as ‘cis-NAT-siRNAs’) have functional roles in environmental stress responses10,11 and in double fertilization.12 SiRNAs are more likely to be generated from cis-NAT genes than from non-NAT genes.13 The density of siRNAs in overlapping regions of cis-NAT pairs is greater than in non-overlapping regions.13Chromatin is divided into different functional regions by epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. All of these chromatin marks have a substantial effect on chromatin structure and gene function. There are a variety of histone modification types, such as methylation and acetylation. Different histone modifications have distinct distribution and distinct functions. H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are known as euchromatic marks and are often abundant in highly expressed genes.14 H3K4me3 accumulate in the promoters and 5' genic regions,14 while H3K36me3 accumulate across the transcribed region.15,16 H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are major silencing mechanisms in plants.17 H3K9me2 is enriched in both the promoter and gene body, which has been found in a limited number of repressed genes in Arabidopsis,18 while H3K27me3 prefers to mark across transcribed regions which is associated with tissue-specific and developmentally regulated genes.15,17,18 Methylation can occur at any cytosine in plants: CG, CHG and CHH (where H = A, C or T). Genes are usually methylated within the promoters (so-called ‘promoter-methylated’), or within the transcribed regions away from the 3' and 5' end (so-called ‘body-methylated’).19 Promoter-methylation is usually linked to transcriptional silencing, whereas body-methylation prefers exons and likely plays an effect on exon definition during splicing.20 Growing evidence shows that NATs are involved in epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation21 and histone modification.22 For example, CDKN1A, an antisense transcript of a tumour suppressor gene, can recruit histone-modifying complexes, which induces H3K27me3 to target the promoter region of the sense transcript.23 Furthermore, Conley and Jordan24 found that cis-NATs’ expression are regulated epigenetically in human genome by analysing the chromatin environment of cis-NATs’ promoters. In Arabidopsis, two transcripts, COOLAIR and COLDAIR, are related with FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which encodes a floral repressor in vernalization.25,26NATs are involved in complex regulatory networks. Nowadays, most NATs research focuses on protein-coding genes (PCs), which typically lead to cis-NATs. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transposon elements genes (TEs) or pseudogenes should also be taken into consideration. These genome elements have been considered as genomic rubbish, but it is increasingly apparent that they have many roles in organism development. Here, we used a genome-wide method to discover cis- and trans-NATs of A. thaliana, and analysed their multiple aspects, such as expression relationships, production of siRNA and epigenetic patterns.2. Materials and methods2.1. LncRNA prediction and transcriptome analysisWe reanalysed seven RNA-sequencing data sets (total of 18 samples, including four tissues: seedling, leaf, flower and root) for transcriptome reconstruction and lncRNA prediction (Supplementary Table S1). Reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) first using Tophat,27 and then the resulting alignment files were used to assemble transcripts. Their expression levels (FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments) were calculated using Cufflinks.28 The assembled transcripts were merged together using the Cuffmerge software. The merged assembly transcripts provide a uniform basis for calculating transcript expression in each condition27 and the transcript class code. If the class code of transcript is ‘u’, ‘x’ or ‘i’, which means the transcript is intergenic sequence, antisense of known gene or intronic sequence, we took it to be a lncRNA candidate. The CPAT software29 was used to assess coding potential of candidate lncRNAs. A candidate was retained if it satisfied: (i) the length should be more than 200 nucleotides; (ii) the maximum ORF length should be no longer than 120 amino acids and (iii) the coding probability cut-off value by CPAT should be <0.365. Furthermore, the transcript which is homologous with any annotated transcript in TAIR10 or with FPKM < 2 in any sample would be removed. Genomic features of these lncRNAs, such as locus and sequences, were obtained using custom Perl scripts.2.2. NATs identificationWe assumed that cis-NAT pairs are complementary on the same locus and trans-NAT pairs are complementary but from different loci, in the same way as in our previous study.2 The predicted lncRNAs were complementary to annotated genes in TAIR10 was used as reference of genes. If two transcripts overlap in the genome, they will be selected as putative cis-NAT pairs. For cis-NATs, they can be grouped into five categories: divergent (head-to-head overlap), convergent (tail-to-tail overlap), containing (full overlap), nearby head-to-head and nearby tail-to-tail according to their relative orientation and degree of overlap. Trans-NATs were identified by the following operations. Blast+30 was applied to search for potential complementary of NAT transcripts pairs. DINAMelt31 was used to verify whether the pairs could melt into RNA-RNA duplexes in the complementary regions. If the pairing region of two transcripts identified by DINAMelt matches with the Blast search, and if any bubble in the predicted pairing region is no longer than 10% of the region, they would be considered as trans-NAT pairs.2.3. NAT-siRNAs detection and enrichment in overlapping regionsThe enrichment of small RNAs in the overlapping regions of NATs was examined as following: first, for each NAT pair, we have counted the number (No) of NAT-siRNAs from our smRNA library mapping to the overlapping region, and the number (Ng) of siRNAs matching with the non-overlapping regions of two genes. If the length of the overlapping region is Lo, and the sum of the lengths of the non-overlapping regions of two genes is Lg, then the density of siRNA loci in the overlapping region is No/Lo, and the density of the non-overlapping regions of the two genes is Ng/Lg. For each data set described in this study, we have computed the average densities of siRNA that spawned from NAT genes in the overlapping regions (Ao) and non-overlapping regions (Ag). The ratio Ao/Ag was considered as the enrichment score (R), and a one-tail paired two-sample t-test was performed to test the significance of this enrichment.Forty smRNA-sequencing data sets collected from GEO were used to identify NAT-siRNAs. After removing the reads that match to fRNADB,32 such as rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA or miRNA (but preserving tRNA) from the raw data, the filtered sequences were mapped to Arabidopsis genome sequences using bowtie.33 Then, the smRNA uniquely mapped onto the genome and the length of which is between 18nt and 28nt was selected to constitute our smRNA library. From this library, the smRNA that could be mapped to the overlapping region of a single NAT pair and be discovered in at least three data sets was considered as a NAT-siRNA. We discovered 5,385 NAT-siRNAs, of which 1,548 appeared in three tissues, and 945 and 142 specifically appearing only in seedling and flower, respectively.2.4. Epigenetic analysis of NAT genes and non-NAT genesIn order to explore the difference of histone modification patterns between NAT genes and non-NAT genes, we downloaded the normalized data sets of ChIP-chip data,34 including H2Bub, H3K27me3, H3K27me1, H3K4me3, H4K4me2 and H3K36me3.The normalized data were analysed using the MultichipmixHMM method.35 Following MultichipmixHMM analysis, neighbouring enriched tiles were joined into domains, with allowing a maximal gap of 200 nucleotides. Only domains of at least 400 nucleotides were considered for further analysis. We acquired genomic locations of these domains using custom Perl scripts.To investigate the patterns of DNA methylation on NAT genes and non-NAT genes, we obtained ChIP-seq data sets from GEO. Based on the genome-wide DNA methylation sites, we calculated the absolute methylation level36 of cis-NAT genes, trans-NAT genes and non-NAT genes at CG, CHG and CHH sites, respectively.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome-wide identification of NATs in A. thalianaRecent studies have shown that lncRNAs may act as cognate antisense transcripts of other genes26,37 which may have roles in regulating gene expression via chromatin-dependent functions. In order to comprehensively identify Arabidopsis NATs, we first determined 1,138 lncRNAs, which were complementary to annotated genes in TAIR10. We predicted 6,571 NAT pairs (Table 1), including 4,080 cis-NAT pairs and 2,491 trans-NAT pairs. Of these 4,080 cis-NAT pairs, 1,269 are of types ‘nearby head-to-head’ or ‘nearby tail-to-tail’. Although these are two accepted types of cis-NAT, their action mechanism is unknown. We focused our analysis on the other types of cis-NATs: convergent; containing and divergent; as well as all trans-NATs. Among all transcripts, 7,962 (23.9%) NAT genes from annotated genes (TAIR10) formed NAT pairs and 828 (72.8%) lncRNAs took part in NAT pairs. We discovered that most genes of trans-NATs are non-protein-coding genes (NPC) (66.2%), while the genes that are taking part in cis-NATs are mostly PCs (79.4%). This indicates that PCs prefer to form cis- pair rather than trans-, while NPCs have the opposite preference. To demonstrate this feature, the distribution of NAT genes along chromosomes was plotted. From Fig. 1A, we can see that most trans-NAT pairs are located in the centriole, where many NPCs are located, thus, showing that NPCs are more likely to be part of trans-NATs than of cis-NATs. The smRNAs are found across the whole chromosomes with a lower level in the centriole and terminals. Whereas NAT-siRNAs derived from specific regions have a high level at some trans-NATs regions. We supposed that NAT-siRNAs were derived from not only cis-NAT pairs but also from trans-NAT pairs.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.A NAT network was constructed based on the observed relationships between NAT-genes so as to determine whether any genes are involved in several NAT pairs. Figure 1B shows the subnetworks of the NAT-network, in which the node number is more than 10. From the NAT-network, we found that many transcripts have more than one partners and are involved in several NAT pairs. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted for each subnetwork, but only the tRNA-hub subnetwork is found to have significant enrichment in GO terms. That may be because most large subnetworks were constructed by NPCs, which are not annotated by GO. It was observed that the biggest subnetwork contains 445 (91.2%) NPCs and most of them could form trans-NATs, indicating that NPCs are not only more likely to form trans-NAT pairs with other NPC genes but also they have more than one partner. In contrast, PCs always have only one partner to form a cis-NAT pair and PCs were hardly ever within a wider subnetwork. The NAT network suggests that the expression of genes may be influenced by other genes in a common network. There are many star-nets of the subnetworks, which suggest that the hub of the net can be matched with many genes to produce NAT pairs. Strikingly, the hubs of stat-nets mostly are tRNA-genes, as previously reported by Zhou in Oryza sativa.38 Maybe some tRNAs participate in regulation though double-stranded structures; however, this needs more deep studies.We counted the numbers of overlapping position types in PC NAT-genes to explore which parts of genes are found to overlap. Figure 1C illustrates the positions of PC NAT-genes prefer to form overlaps in the following trend: 3'-UTR > 5'-UTR > across the coding sequence, which is similar to the former observation13 that NAT-siRNAs predominantly appear in non-coding regions.3.2. siRNA derived from NATTo discover if NATs prefer to derive small RNA, we collected 40 small RNA sequencing data sets and obtained a total of more than 100 million raw sequencing reads. After removing the sequencing reads matched to miRNAs, snoRNAs and other small RNAs from fRNADB,32 the remaining reads were mapped to the chromosome sequences using bowtie.33 Unique sequences with length between 18nt and 28nt were selected for further analysis.To evaluate whether small RNAs are enriched in the overlapping region rather than non-overlapping region of NATs, we computed the significance of enrichment by t-test. The results are shown in Table 2 (all are shown in Supplementary Table S2 sheet of small RNA enrichment). We calculated the enrichment score and found there was no significant siRNA enrichment in the overlapping region. However, it is significant that siRNA enrichment in the overlapping region was larger than in non-overlapping region which is consistent with Zhang's discovery.13 Furthermore, the NATs were classified into three subtypes: PC/PC, PC/NPC and NPC/NPC, according to the transcript coding potential, both in cis- and trans- NATs. To explore if different NATs exhibit inequable raising small RNA, the siRNA density in the overlapping and non-overlapping region of each NAT subtype was calculated. Surprisingly, the enrichment scores of NPC/NPC in cis-NATs and PC/PC in trans-NATs were large and with significant P-values, which means small RNAs are enriched in NPC/NPC pairwise in cis-NATs and PC/PC pairwise in trans-NATs. So we could conclude that the NPC/NPC pairs in cis-NATs and PC/PC pairs in trans-NATs prefer to produce small RNAs.

The observation suggested that NAT-siRNAs are associated with specific tissues. Furthermore, we tested the length distribution of NAT-siRNAs (Fig. 1D), and found that most NAT-siRNAs are mainly 21 and 24 nucleotides.To investigate which type of NAT prefers to produce NAT-siRNAs, we calculated the number of siRNAs in each of the NAT pair subtype. From PC genes, 1,720 NAT-siRNAs were generated and 3,665 were from NPC genes. Some transcripts might have more than one partner, which means some NAT-siRNAs may be derived from different NAT pair subtypes. We call this type of NAT-siRNA ‘nonunique NAT-siRNA’. Whereas ‘unique NAT-siRNA’ means the NAT-siRNA-derived gene only formed one NAT pairwise. We classified the subtype more clearly into: PC–NPC, PC–PC, NPC–PC and NPC–NPC. The first transcript in the pairwise type is the one that could produce NAT-siRNA, and the second transcript is partner of the first accordingly. The numbers of unique NAT-siRNAs raised from different subtypes in cis-NATs are: PC–PC, 366; PC–NPC, 137; NPC–PC, 329 and NPC–NPC, 2,428, meanwhile in trans-NATs are: PC–PC, 418; PC–NPC, 421; NPC–PC, 216 and NPC–NPC, 525. This shows that cis-NAT-siRNAs mostly originated from NPCs, whereas transNAT-siRNAs mostly originated from PCs. Moreover, most cis-NAT-siRNAs from NPCs are 21nt and a large number of transNAT-siRNAs from PCs are 24nt (Supplementary Fig. S1).3.3. The expression of NAT-siRNAsDiverse Dicer-like enzymes (DCLs) may take part in RNA silencing pathways, such as DCL1, DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4 within plants. DCL1 mainly associates with the production of miRNA and endogenous tasiRNA. DCL2 generates siRNAs from NATs. DCL3 generates siRNA that act as a guide for subsequent chromatin modifications, while DCL4 takes part in inverted-repeat (IR) transgenes silencing.39,40 The functions of DCLs are not only specialized and compartmentalized but are also complementary to each other. DCL2 and DCL4 are important in antiviral defence. DCL2 affects alternative processing of siRNA precursors in the absence of DCL4.41 The biogenesis of NAT-siRNA is dependent on DCL1, DCL2 and RDR6.10,11 Furthermore, Zhang et al.13 found that the accumulation of NAT-siRNAs required DCL1, DCL3 and RDR2, although they only verified a few NAT-siRNAs, we supposed there should be other feature of NAT-siRNAs’ biogenesis and function.The profile of NAT-siRNAs suggests that their biogenesis might be through different pathways (Fig. 2A). The sample of the greatest accumulation of NAT-siRNA is rdr2, which implies that generation of most NAT-siRNA is RDR2-independent. The length and NAT type in each mutant sample of NAT-siRNAs were further analysed (Fig. 2C). In the rdr2 sample, most expressed NAT-siRNAs are 21nt and the containing type (cis type). However, in the rdr6 sample, most are 24nt and trans type. These results indicated that 21nt NAT-siRNA could be RDR2-independent and 24nt could be RDR6-independent. We concluded that the biogenesis of 21nt NAT-siRNA is by RDR6 and DCL1 or DCL2 pathways and of 24nt NAT-siRNA is by RDR2 and DCL3 pathways. Expression of NAT-siRNAs.

(D) Reads per million of NAT-siRNAs in mutant samples. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The expression patterns of 21nt and 24nt transNAT-siRNAs were investigated in the small RNA-sequencing data sets of ddm1, rdr6 and ddm1 rdr6 (Fig. 2D). We calculated the RPM (reads per million) in each sample. 21nt transNAT-siRNAs accumulated significantly compared with the 24nt transNAT-siRNAs, in ddm1. Furthermore, fewer 21nt transNAT-siRNAs were found in rdr6 and ddm1 rdr6. Thus, the generation of 21nt transNAT-siRNAs depends on RDR6 and rises in epigenetically activated ddm1 mutant. This indicates that 21nt NAT-siRNAs generated from trans-NATs are important in repressing the expression of TE, especially in epigenetically activated situations.The expression analysis of the NAT-siRNAs was studied in four different condition data sets (Fig. 2B). Compared with the expression of NAT-siRNAs in control data set, more specific NAT-siRNAs were expressed under cold environment. Here, also some common NAT-siRNAs appeared in four data sets (Supplementary Fig. S2). By comparing the common NAT-siRNAs and specific NAT-siRNAs, we found that the percentages of trans-NATs and 24nt NAT-siRNAs increased in specific conditions, which is presumably because trans-NATs and 24nt NAT-siRNAs play a major role in stress responses. These results indicate that NATs, especially trans-NATs, have important function in response to environmental pressures.3.4. Histone modifications among NAT genesIn order to understand the relationship between histone modifications and NAT genes, we have analysed the distributions of six chromatin modifications (H2Bub, H3K27me3, H3K27me1, H3K4me3, H4K4me2 and H3K36me3) along cis-NAT genes, trans-NAT genes and non-NAT genes. According to the enriched domains definition (Materials and methods section), domains were discovered for each chromatin mark, and then average enrichment levels were calculated within and around genes for all marks. Values are higher within the transcribed region for all the six histone modifications and typically lower in either upstream or downstream regions (Fig. 3A). H3K4me3, H3K4me2 and H3K36me3 accumulated in the transcribed region, and tilted slightly to the 5'-terminal promoter side, especially H3K4me3. In contrast, H2Bub, H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 prefer to mark across transcribed regions, and are higher towards the centre. However, distribution patterns vary for different marks, which are in agreement with previous reports.15–17,42–44 Furthermore, these chromatin modifications exhibit preferential association with NATs. Figure 3A shows that active marks are more enriched in cis-NAT genes, and illustrates the following enrichment trend: cis-NAT > non-NAT > trans-NAT genes. However, H3K27me1 is mostly enriched in trans-NAT genes, and a bit higher enriched in non-NAT genes than in cis-NAT genes. H3K27me3 is mainly enriched in non-NAT genes, with a similar degree of enrichment in cis-NAT and trans-NAT genes which are smaller than in non-NAT genes.

G1, G2 are euchromatic and heterochromatic marks, same as above. NON refers to genes are not marked by above six histone modifications.This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To investigate whether the chromatin environment of NAT genes differs from non-NAT genes, the epigenetic modifications between them were compared. According to the association with transcriptional activities, six histone modifications could be divided into two groups. Group 1 (G1) includes the following four histone modifications: H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and H2Bub, which are known as euchromatic marks and often are related with active genes.15,44,45 H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 make up the group 2 (G2), which are often known as heterochromatic marks or associated with silenced regions.34,43 Our analysis indicates that there are clear differences between the chromatin states for cis-NAT, trans-NAT and non-NAT genes (Fig. 3B): cis-NAT genes tend to be targeted by histone marks from G1, whereas trans-NAT genes are mostly marked by histone modifications from G2. One possible explanation for the differential histone modification patterns among these three gene groups is that they have a different percentage of transposon element genes. The majority of TEs are inactive, and there is a steady epigenetic modification state that maintains the TEs silence.46 TEs are mostly targeted by regressive marks, rather than active marks. We tested this assumption by calculating the percentage of TEs in three gene groups. As expected, the trans-NAT gene group has the largest proportion of TEs (36.5%, 653 of 1,788), and the largest proportion of other NPC genes (29.7%, 531 of 1,788). Although a similar proportion of PCs was observed for cis-NAT and non-NAT gene groups (79.4 and 81.2%, respectively), there are more TEs and less lncRNAs in the non-NAT gene group (12.0%, 3,083 of 25,671 and 1.2%, 310 of 25,671, respectively) than in the cis-NAT gene group (2.7%, 205 of 7,473 and 11.0%, 821 of 7,473, respectively). Compared with the chromatin status of TEs from cis-NAT, trans-NAT and non-NAT gene group (Fig. 3C), TEs from the trans-NAT and non-NAT gene groups are hardly targeted by marks from G1. But in the cis-NAT gene group, more than 35% TEs are marked by histone modifications from G1. All these results indicate that although TEs in the cis-NAT gene group are few, they are more likely to be targeted by G1 than those within the trans-NAT genes group.To check the assumption that NAT gene pairs share common histone modification patterns, all NAT pairs were divided into 10 groups according to the modification of each gene in the pairwise (Fig. 3D). To further compare the epigenetic patterns between NAT pairs and randomized pairs in each group, two sets genes were randomly selected as the control sets from non-NAT genes, which have the same gene number with the cis-NATs and trans-NATs groups. The random selections were performed 10 000 times and the average percentage of each set in each group was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3D, there are different percentages between cis-NAT pairs and trans-NAT pairs in each group. Cis-NAT pairs are mostly marked by group G1_G1, and trans-NAT pairs are marked by G2_G2, which indicate the two genes share a common histone modification pattern. Regarding to cis-NAT pairs, 67.7% (1,904 of 2,811) are marked by G1_G1, which is greater than the percentage of randomized pairs; however, only 3.2% (89 of 2,811) are marked by G2_G2, which is less than the percentage of randomized pairs. Among the 1,904 cis-NAT pairs, marked by activated modification G1_G1, 1,141 (70.6%, 1,141 of 1,616) are convergent pairs, 267 (69.5%, 267 of 384) are divergent pairs and 496 (61.2%, 496 of 811) are containing pairs. This indicates that different types of cis-NAT pair show no difference in their epigenetic patterns, and most of them are targeted by active modification marks. In contrast, almost half of (1,239 of 2,491) trans-NAT pairs are targeted by G2_G2 and just 8.0% (199 of 2,491) pairs are targeted by G1_G1; 2.6% (66 of 2,491) of trans-NAT pairs are marked by oppositely functional epigenetic marks, G1_G2.3.5. DNA methylation among NAT genesMethylation of cytosine in nuclear DNA is a common form of epigenetic modifications that has been reported to exist in mammals and plants. To analyse the relationship of DNA methylation between NAT genes, absolute methylation levels were calculated within and around genes at CG, CHG and CHH sites from six methylation data sets. As shown in Fig. 4A, the DNA methylation level in trans-NAT genes is higher than that in cis-NAT genes, indicating DNA methylation, as a repression mark, is more enriched in trans-NAT genes and less enriched in cis-NAT genes. As expected, TEs from the cis-NAT gene group had the lowest level of methylation compared with those TEs from the trans-NAT and non-NAT gene group (Supplementary Fig. S3).

The absolutely methylation levels are plotted in 5'-UTR and transcribed region of cis-NAT genes, trans-NAT genes and non-NAT genes, in six samples respectively.

The TEs are located closely to the genes whose functions are important for the relevant tissue type. The hypomethylation of TEs promoted the expression of the surrounding genes, suggesting TEs may be responsible for wiring tissue-specific regulatory networks.47 We searched the genes around (2 kb) TEs from the cis-NAT gene group and obtained 114 functional annotations from the GO (Supplementary Table S1). According to the function annotation, 12 of the genes adjacent to TEs are involved in response to stresses, such as virus, bacteria and salt. This indicates that those TEs, which are marked by histone modifications from G1 and are less methylated, may play an important role in systemic resistance.To explore if the two genes from NAT pair have more similar DNA methylation pattern than two randomly selected non-NAT genes, we compared the distance of DNA methylation levels between a NAT pair and a randomized non-NAT pair. We used one minus Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, i.e. DmC = 1 – r, to define the distance of DNA methylation, specifically the distance of DNA methylation at CG, CHG and CHH sites associated in promoter and transcribed regions, respectively. A smaller value of DmC indicates a greater similarity of DNA methylation pattern between sense and antisense gene of a NAT gene pair. Randomized pairs were selected from 27 910 non-NAT genes (including lncRNAs) with 10 000 repeats. As expected, we discovered that these six measures show a higher similarity degree of DNA methylation between cis-NAT gene pairs than that of randomized non-NAT gene pairs (Wilcoxon's rank-sum test: P < 0.05 for all cases). For trans-NAT gene pairs, similar results hold (Wilcoxon's rank-sum test: P < 0.05 for five cases), except at CHH sites, where trans-NAT gene pairs and randomized pairs show no difference in their DNA methylation distance.We also compared the DNA methylation distance between cis-NAT pair genes and trans-NAT pair genes. As shown in Fig. 4B, trans-NAT pairs have a much greater DNA methylation distance in transcribed regions than cis-NAT pairs. Whereas in 5'-promoter regions, cis-NAT pairs have a larger methylation distance between sense and antisense gene in CG and CHG except in CHH.3.6. Expression network of NAT genesMany sense–antisense genes show correlated expression. For example, some cis-NATs can regulate the transcript abundance of their complement by triggering the biogenesis of natural antisense siRNA which subsequently guides transcript cleavage.48 Chen et al.49 found that cis-NAT gene pairs tend to be coexpressed or inversely expressed more frequently than expected, and they are conserved through evolution. In order to explore comprehensively the correlation between two genes of a cis-NAT pair or a trans-NAT pair, a NAT expression network was constructed. We used dsRNA-sequencing data sets to determine whether NAT pairs formed double-stranded structures in vivo. We counted the average reads that mapped in the overlapping region and also upstream and downstream of this region, then found the dsRNA reads were enriched at overlapping region with significant P-values (Supplementary Fig. S4). This indicates that NATs forming double-stranded structure in vivo are widespread. One thousand eight hundred and twelve NAT pairs were detected to appear in dsRNA-sequencing data sets. The reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) of a gene's expression was counted from the 15 RNA-sequencing data sets. Genes occurring in less than three data sets were removed. Then, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the expressions of two genes in a NAT pair was calculated. To show the network clearly, we focused on pairs with correlation |PCC| > 0.8 to construct a network of NAT pairs’ expression (Fig. 5). In this work, the coexpression of NATs is more common than expected. Many TEs are organized into subnetworks and most PC has coexpression relationship with just one partner. The expression network of NAT-genes. The network was constructed by the NAT pairs with expression correlation |PCC| = 0.8. The solid and dash edge shows cis- and trans- type of the pair.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Since many of the NAT genes have an expression correlation and they also have a natural structure relationship, we supposed there might be some regulatory mechanisms shared. To discovery if this is true, we mapped the features of NATs to the expression network. And we focused on the regulation features of NAT-siRNA silencing and epigenetic modifications. We identified coexpressed NAT gene pairs that have the potential to produce NAT-siRNA as well as the coexpressed NAT gene pairs that have a strong epigenetic modification relationship (the absolute value of their PCC of modification pattern similarity is larger than 0.8). Incorporating the feature into the NAT expression network (Fig. 5), we found that most coexpressed NATs have closely related epigenetic modifications. This suggests that some NATs influence each other through their epigenetic modifications and not only through endogenous NAT-siRNAs.3.7. ConclusionWe have made a genome-wide analysis of NATs in A. thaliana. To form NAT pairs, 23.9% of genes of Arabidopsis in TAIR10 and 72.8% of unannotated lncRNA were discovered, which indicated that most lncRNA prefer to form double-stranded structures. That may be a mechanism by which lncRNAs regulate other transcripts. We predicted 6,571 NAT pairs including 4,080 cis-NAT pairs and 2,491 trans-NAT pairs. From the predicted NAT pairs, we found not only lncRNAs take part in forming NATs but also TE transcripts. The non-coding transcripts prefer to form trans-NAT and PC transcripts prefer to form cis-NAT. PC transcripts often only have a single partner to form a pair of NAT; however, NPC have more than one partner and can form several NAT pairs, which leads to a regulatory network. That is a new view about NATs and it indicates different types of genes may have a special function.One accepted mechanism of NAT regulation is that the antisense transcript could produce siRNA to repress sense transcript expression. By comparing the small RNA density in different regions of the genes, we have shown that small RNA enrichment is significant in the overlapping region of cis-NAT pair formed by two non-coding protein transcripts and in the overlapping region of trans-NAT pair formed by both coding protein transcripts. Furthermore, these two types of NATs also typically generate NAT-siRNAs. We detected the genome-wide prevalence of NAT-siRNAs and discovered that the lengths of NAT-siRNAs are mainly 21nt and 24nt. Most 21nt NAT-siRNAs are derived from cis-NATs, whereas most 24nt NAT-siNRAs are from trans-NATs. Based on the NAT-siRNA profiles investigated from smRNA sequencing data sets, 21nt NAT-siRNAs were detected to been processed by DCL1 and/or DCL2, RDR6 and 24nt NAT-siRNAs were found to been processed by DCL3, RDR2. Furthermore, 21nt transNAT-siRNAs have a role in repressing transcripts expression in an epigenetically activated situation. Moreover, 24nt NAT-siRNAs were more likely expressed under stress conditions.The analysis results of epigenetic modifications show the two genes in a NAT pair have similar histone modifications. cis-NAT genes are the most likely to be enriched with active marks, followed by non-NAT and then trans-NAT genes. However, heterochromatic marks such as H3K27me1 are enriched in trans-NAT genes, even though H3K27me1 is mainly found in non-NAT genes. To explain this observation, we analysed TEs in NATs. Although cis-NATs contain less TEs than trans-NATs, the percentage of TEs which are targeted by euchromatic histone marks in cis-NATs is much more than in trans-. We do not know the specific mechanism by which NAT formation influences the modification of TEs or by which specific TEs tends to favour the cis-NAT formation, but there are some relations. We also discovered the two genes of NAT pair have similar DNA methylation profiles in the promoter and translated region, with the cis-NAT gene pairs more similar than trans-NAT gene pairs. Eventually, the methylation levels of CG, CHG and CHH in trans-NAT all are higher than in cis-NAT.All the analyses illustrate NAT as a natural formed molecular has important regulation functions both at transcriptional level and at post-transcriptional level. A regulatory network was constructed to illustrate the relationship between NAT genes expression and the potentially regulatory relationship. This indicates the regulation of expression between NATs may be through NAT-siRNA interference and/or epigenetic effects. We hope this study could expand the current views of NATs in plants, and will inspire more research efforts on the detailed regulatory mechanisms of NATs.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (No. 31371328, 31450110068), National Science and Technology Project of China (No. 2009DFA32030); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China; Sino-Germany Cooperation on Agricultural Science and Technology, Germany; and Henry Lester Trust, UK.

IntroductionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for recycling of the cellular cytoplasmic contents or breaking down damaged materials in a cell, which plays essential roles in the remobilization of cytoplasmic components during nutrient starvation conditions.1 Identification of genes regulating autophagy in 1990s opened up the possibility to understand the molecular mechanism underlying autophagy and to explore the potential roles of autophagy in different physiological processes.2 In the past two decades, a series of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) required for autophagy have been characterized in yeast and mammals, and several important roles of autophagy in various developmental events, such as adaptation to starvation, regulation of metabolism, differentiation of cell types, clearance of damaged organelles, suppression of tumour, have been discovered.2,3 In addition, analyses of the networks of autophagy-related proteins revealed a canonical molecular pathway regulating the process of autophagy in yeast and mammals.4Although remarkable progresses have been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagic pathways in yeast and mammals, molecular mechanisms and potential roles of autophagy in plants are still largely unknown. Recently, a great effort has been put on relevant studies and made it an energetic field. On the basis of sequence similarity to ATGs required for autophagy in yeast and mammals, a set of ATGs have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana5,6 and Oryza sativa,7 respectively, and several roles of autophagy in plant development have been elucidated, e.g. leaf starch degeneration,8 tracheary element differentiation,9 hypertensive cell death,10 senescence,11,12 stress responses,13 life span extension,14 maintenance of peroxisomal quality,15–17 and anther development.18 In addition, core molecular machinery of autophagy was approved to be conserved among plants, yeast and mammals.4,6 However, the overall and specific roles of autophagy under normal and stress conditions, and their regulatory pathway underlying autophagy in plants, are still largely unknown.Nicotiana tabacum, a traditional model plant, is assumed to originate from a hybridization event between ancestors of Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis ~200,000 yrs ago.19 It is considered to be an ideal model plant for the study of autophagy in the processes of plant development and in the response to various severe environmental factors.20–22 However, only a few ATGs have been identified in tobacco. To facilitate our understanding of the roles of autophagy in plant development and molecular mechanism underlying it, it is essential to identify ATGs in tobacco. A systematic survey of ATGs in draft genomes of N. tabacum and expression sequence tags deposited in NCBI was performed, and comprehensive analyses of the expression patterns of ATGs under both normal and stress conditions were also carried out to gain insights into their putative roles in plant development under normal and in plant response to ill-suited environments.2. Methods and materials2.1. Plant materialsNicotiana tabacum L. cv. Petite Havana SR1 plants were grown under 16 h/8 h light/dark cycles, at 25°C in greenhouse.2.2. Identification ATGs in tobaccoTo identify ATGs based on the draft genomes of N. tabacum,23 the program tBlastn using autophagy-related protein sequences in A. thaliana and O. sativa was performed in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The DNA fragments and EST sequences related to ATGs were collected, respectively. Sequence assembling and open reading frame (ORF) analysis of each contig were performed using ContigExpress and OMEGA, respectively. After ORF analysis, BLASTP analysis with intact or partial deduced protein sequences of each contig was performed. The contigs corresponding to autophagy-related protein sequences based on the returning information were selected as candidates for further study.2.3. Isolation of full-length cDNA of each ATG in tobaccoAfter ORF and BLASTP analyses of each contig, full-length cDNA of ATG candidates was obtained through an electronic cloning method or a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach. Total RNA isolated from anthers and leaves was used as a template to synthesize first-strand cDNA with the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech), and all reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. And then, full-length cDNA of each ATG was further confirmed through RT-PCR with specific primers at the 5' and 3' end, respectively.2.4. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysisTo analyse the relationships of autophagy-related genes identified in N. tabacum with that in A. thaliana and O. sativa, a multiple sequence alignment of ATG protein sequences was conducted with Clustal X ver. 1.81 program using the default multiple alignment parameters. The tree was constructed with MEGA 5.1 software using a maximum parsimony method.2.5. RNA isolation and RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from leaf, root, stem, anther and pollen using TRI Reagent Solution (Ambion), and total RNA of seeds at different stages were extracted with RNAqueous™ (Ambion). All total RNA were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) and cDNA were synthesized using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa) under the condition recommended by the manufacturer procedure. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out in a 50-µl PCR mixture containing 5 µl of 10× Ex Taq buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.2 µM of primers, 1.2 U of Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and cDNA prepared from different tissues. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control for normalization of cDNA prepared from different tissues. Detailed PCR conditions are described as follows: initial step for denaturation at 94°C for 2 min; then 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at Tm -5°C for 30 s; extension at 72°C for 1 min and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted for expression pattern analysis according to the previous procedure.242.6. Different stress treatments for tobacco seedlingsFor different stress treatments, tobacco seeds were germinated in modified MS medium at 28°C for 2 weeks. Two-week-old seedlings were then transferred to different conditions for stress treatment. For carbon starvation, 2-week-old seedlings were transferred into modified MS medium without sucrose for 4, 16, 24 and 48 h, respectively. For nitrogen starvation, 2-week-old seedlings were transferred into nitrogen-free MS medium, in which NH4NO3 and KNO3 were replaced by KCl. For salt treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were transferred into modified MS medium containing 250 mM NaCl for 4 h. For cold treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were cultured in modified MS medium in 4°C for 4 h. For drought treatment, seedlings were kept in filter paper for 4 h at 28°C. For dark treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were kept in dark for 48 h at 28°C. For hormone treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were transferred into modified MS medium containing 1 µM naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 5 µM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 25 µM abscisic acid (ABA) or 5 µM gibberellic acid (GA3), 500 µM salicylic acid (SA) and 500 µM jasmonic acid (JA), for 24 h, respectively. For heavy metal treatment, 2-week-old seedlings were transferred into modified MS medium containing 40 µM CdCl2, 40 µM NiSO4, 40 µM ZnCl2, 20 µM CuSO4 or 100 µM MnCl4 for 24 h, respectively.3. Results3.1. Collection and identification of ATGs in tobaccoTo identify ATGs in tobacco, the tBlastn program using different autophagy-related protein sequences from A. thaliana and O. sativa was performed. Returned sequences related to ATGs were collected and assembled using ContigExpress, and redundant sequences were omitted manually. Then, a total of 30 individual contigs related to ATGs in tobacco were obtained. Full-length cDNA of them were obtained through an electronic cloning method or a RACE technique, and were further confirmed through RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. The detailed information of each gene was described in Table 1. To confirm that the 30 putative ATG homologues in tobacco are indeed ATGs, the deduced ATG protein sequences were analysed in the Pfam database and their sequence similarities to known ATG proteins in A. thaliana were analysed. The returned information of each ATG in the Pfam database were listed in Table 1, suggesting that all 30 ATGs in tobacco could be considered as true ATGs. Phylogenetically, each ATG protein sequence exhibits high similarities to their homologue in A. thaliana (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). However, several ATG groups (ATG1, ATG8, ATG10 and ATG18) in A. thaliana and N. tabacum were separated by ATGs in O. sativa in the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating the diversification of ATG evolution in different ATG groups. Generally, predicated 30 ATGs in tobacco could be divided into 12 different ATG groups and 4 relatives, and among them, the following groups comprise multiple isoforms: ATG1, ATG8, ATG13, ATG18 and VTI12. The composition of domains in each subgroup is similar with two exceptions (ATG1 and ATG18). ATG1c shows a similar serine/threonine-protein kinase domain at N-terminal to that of ATG1a and b, but lacks the C-terminal structure as shown in ATG1a and b (Fig. 2). A similar phenomenon was also observed in the ATG18 group. Two different subgroups could be divided according to the C-terminal structure. They show a similar N-terminal structure, but lacking of a C-terminal BCAS3 domain in ATG18d, ATG18e and ATG18f (Fig. 2). The composition of conserved domain in other groups is similar to that in Arabidopsis, indicating that the core machinery of autophagy is conserved in different angiosperms.

Interestingly, all of them show a universal expression pattern in the eight tissues tested. These data suggest that all predicted ATGs are exactly existed in tobacco and autophagy may play a house-keeping role in the process of plant development.

Expression profile of NtATGs under normal growth environmentsThere are growing evidences, suggesting that autophagy plays critical roles in the processes of plant development under normal conditions such as leaf starch degradation,8 root cell growth,25 rubisco degradation during leaf senescence,26 programmed cell death (PCD) of suspensor in somatic embryos of Picea abies,27 and maintenance of peroxisomal quality.15–17 To explore their potential roles in the processes of plant development, it is essential to study their expression pattern under normal growth conditions. RT-qPCR experiments were thus carried out, based on the cDNA from different tissues including leaf, stem, root, petal, sepal, anther, pollen, pistil, ovule and seeds at different developmental stages. The relative expression level of each ATG in different tissues was detected and compared with each other. Heat map analysis based on the relative expression level of each ATG was also performed, and an overview of the expression profile of ATGs in tobacco is presented in Fig. 4. Each ATG in tobacco exhibits a relatively broad expression pattern, which differ from the expression pattern of ATGs in O. sativa.7 Some tissue specifically expressed ATGs, such as OsATG1b and OsATG8d, have been identified.7 In contrast to that in O. sativa, the transcripts of each ATG in tobacco could be detected in all tissues tested, indicating a universal role of autophagy in the process of plant development. However, majority of ATGs show a relatively higher expression level in pollen/anther compared with that in other tissues tested. And, four homologues of ATG8 (NtATG8a, NtATG8b, NtATG8d and NtATG8e) show a relatively high expression level among all ATGs tested, which was thought to be required for autophagosome formation and reliable markers for the induction and progression of autophagy. Whereas four ATG18 group members (NtATG18a, NtATG18b, NtATG18c and NtATG18e) in ATG9 recycling complex show a relatively low expression level among all ATGs tested.

Scale bar represents fold change (log2 value).Another striking characteristic of the expression profile is the temporal variations of ATGs during the process of seed formation. Three expression characteristics of ATGs could be observed in the whole process of seed development. The first is that the expression level of majority ATGs decreased upon fertilization with a few exceptions (ATG8b, ATG9, ATG18d, ATG20 and NtVPS34). The second is that the expression levels of most ATGs are relatively stable during embryogenesis (seeds at 4–14 days after pollination). The third is that the expression peak of ATGs was found at the stage of seed maturation (Fig. 5). All these data suggest that autophagy may function at different developmental stages during the process of seed formation. Dynamic changes in NtATGs during the process of seed development.

Expression pattern analysis of NtATGs under nitrogen and carbon starvationAutophagy is thought to function in protein breakdown and recycling of amino acids for survival in response to nutrient starvation, which is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Some ATGs in plants have been approved to participate in regulating nutrient recycling under starvation conditions.28 To explore the potential roles of NtATGs during starvation conditions, their relative expression levels were investigated in seedlings that were treated in the condition of carbon and nitrogen starvation, respectively. To analyse the relative expression levels of NtATGs under carbon and nitrogen starvation, seedlings after treated for 4, 16, 24 and 48 h were collected, respectively. The expression levels of NtATGs in the plants were quantified and compared with the control to uncover the key ATGs involved in response to the starvation (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Our analysis showed that 17 NtATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG2, NtATG5, NtATG6, NtATG9, NtATG13a, NtATG13b, NtATG13c, NtATG18a, NtATG18b, NtATG18c, NtATG18d, NtATG18e, NtATG18f, NtVPS15, NtVPS34 and NtTOR) were up-regulated (>2-fold expression change) and 1 NtATG (NtATG8d) was down-regulated (>2-fold expression change) in seedlings after carbon starvation 24 h. In addition, nine NtATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG2, NtATG9, NtATG13c, NtATG18a, NtATG18c, NtATG18e, NtVPS15 and NtVPS34) show dramatically changed expression (>8-fold expression change).

Relative expression levels of each ATG in seedlings under sucrose and nitrogen starvation were normalized to GAPDH (AJ133422), Polyubiquitin (GQ281244), Actin (GQ281246) and Elongation factor 1a (AF120093). The expression level of each ATG was calculated and compared with that in seedlings under normal growth conditions.

Scale bar represents fold change (log2 value).The duration of starvation treatment for the expression level changes is another focus in our study. The relative expression levels of all NtATGs in seedlings show no visible change after 4- and 16-h carbon starvation treatment. However, the relative expression levels of most NtATGs in seedlings increased dramatically after 24-h carbon starvation treatment and with a little further decrease in seedlings after 48-h treatment, indicating that the response of autophagy to starvation signals usually occurs after 16- to 24-h starvation treatment. More interestingly, all NtATGs show a similar response pattern under nitrogen starvation with that in carbon starvation treatment, indicating a common response mechanism to carbon and nitrogen starvation stresses.3.4. Differential expression of NtATGs in response to stress treatmentsTo gain insights into the potential roles of NtATGs in response to various stress treatments, their expression dynamics were investigated through RT-qPCR in tobacco seedlings subjected to dark, cold, drought and salt treatments. Generally, all of the NtATGs, except NtVTI12b in tobacco, are responsive to different stress treatments, and the relative expression levels of them changed significantly upon different stresses (Fig. 7 and Table 2). However, the response of NtATGs to different stresses varied significantly. Only six ATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG2, NtATG13c, NtATG18a, NtATG18c and NtVPS34) were commonly up-regulated by all the four different stress treatments, indicating a common role these NtATGs in dark, cold, drought and salt stresses. Whereas the expression of some NtATGs (NtATG3, NtATG4, NtATG6, NtATG8e, NtATG18b, NtATG18e and NtTOR) were responsive to some specific stress. Expression profile of NtATGs in seedlings under dark, cold, drought and salt stresses. Relative expression levels of each ATG in seedlings under dark, cold, drought and salt stresses were normalized to GAPDH (AJ133422), Polyubiquitin (GQ281244), Actin (GQ281246) and Elongation factor 1a (AF120093).

Blue box indicates the lower transcriptional level of ATGs, whereas red box indicates the higher expression level of ATGs. Scale bar represents fold change (log2 value).In response to dark treatment, the expression level of 19 NtATGs shows significantly changes. Most of them (NtATG1a, NtATG1c, NtATG2, NtATG8a, NtATG8b, NtATG8d, NtATG13a, NtATG13b, NtATG13c, NtATG18a, NtATG18c, NtATG18f, NtATG20, NtVTI12a, NtVPS15 and NtVPS34) are up-regulated in seedlings under dark conditions (>2-fold expression change) and three ATGs (NtATG5, NtATG9 and NtATG18d) were down-regulated (>2-fold expression change). Among them, only six NtATGs (NtATG1c, NtATG8a, NtATG8b, NtATG8d, NtATG20 and NtVTI12a) and two NtATGs (NtATG5 and NtATG9) were specifically up-regulated and down-regulated by dark treatment, respectively. Unlike dark treatment, a larger number of NtATGs (NtATG1b, NtATG1c, NtATG3, NtATG4, NtATG6, NtATG8a, NtATG8b, NtATG8d, NtATG8e, NtATG10, NtATG18b, NtATG18d, NtATG20 and NtVTI12a) were down-regulated by cold stress (>2-fold expression change). For drought treatment, a relatively small number of ATGs (11 of 30 ATGs) show their response to drought stress (seven ATGs up-regulation and four ATGs down-regulation). For salt treatment, 14 NtATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG2, NtATG5, NtATG9, NtATG13a, NtATG13b, NtATG13c, NtATG18a, NtATG18c, NtATG18e, NtATG18f, NtVPS15, NtVPS34 and NtTOR) and 3 NtATGs (NtATG1b, NtATG10 and NtVTI12a) were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively.3.5. Differential expression of NtATGs in response to heavy metal stressHeavy metals are major environmental pollutants, which are highly reactive and toxic to living cells. Correspondingly, organisms have adapted to multiple heavy metal stresses by developing various response mechanisms. In human haematopoietic stem cells, autophagy has been approved to be implicated in the response to Cd2+ stress.29 However, the role of autophagy in response to heavy metal stress in plants still remains unknown. To survey the putative roles of autophagy in plant response to heavy metal stress, it is a prerequisite to extensively analyse their expression dynamics in response to different heavy metal stresses. Thus, the relative expression levels of 30 ATGs were analysed in seedlings treated with five different heavy metals including Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Mn2+ with a comparison to that in untreated seedlings (Fig. 8 and Table 2). Expression profile analysis data showed that the expression of 18 ATGs in seedlings are regulated by at least one heavy metal (>2-fold expression change), and the expression levels of other 12 ATGs (NtATG1b, NtATG3, NtATG4, NtATG6, NtATG8c, NtATG8d, NtATG8e, NtATG10, NtATG18b, NtATG20, NtVTI12a and NtVTI12b) show no visible changes. Among the 18 heavy metal-responsive ATGs, the expression levels of 11 ATGs are commonly up-regulated with 7 exceptions (NtATG1c, NtATG5, NtATG8a, NtATG8b, NtATG13a, NtATG18d and NtATG8e) in seedlings after treated with five different heavy metals, indicating a common mechanism of ATGs in the response to different heavy metal treatments. Interestingly, the expression of ATGs is more sensitive to Zn2+ treatment than to other heavy metals. However, how these heavy metals regulate autophagy remains to be elucidated in the further studies. Expression profile of NtATGs in seedlings under heavy metal stresses. Relative expression levels of each ATG in seedlings under heavy metal stresses were normalized to GAPDH (AJ133422), Polyubiquitin (GQ281244), Actin (GQ281246) and Elongation factor 1a (AF120093). The expression level of each ATG was calculated and compared with that in seedlings under normal growth conditions.

Differential expression of NtATGs in response to plant hormone treatmentPlant hormones are a group of small signal molecules that exert powerful effects on a variety of developmental processes such as embryogenesis,30 root development,31 PCD32 and many other aspects of plant development by ‘regulating gene’ expression. In a recent report, SA signalling pathway was shown to be required for early senescence in atg mutant.12 However, the relationship between plant hormones and autophagy is still largely unknown. To test whether plant hormones could regulate the expression pattern of ATGs, the responses of NtATGs to different plant hormones were analysed in the present study. The relative expression levels of each ATG under six different hormone treatments including NAA, 2,4-D, ABA, GA3, SA and JA were investigated by RT-qPCR, and heat map analysis was conducted based on the relative expression level of each ATG. The data revealed that the expression levels of several ATGs in seedlings changed significantly when treated with different plant hormones. Notably, different ‘hormones’ have ‘diverse effects on the regulation of’ ATG ‘expression’ (Fig. 9 and Table 2). After GA3 treatment, the ‘expression levels of nine’ ATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG5, NtATG13b, NtATG18a, NtATG18c, NtATG18d, NtATG18e, NtVPS15 and NtVPS34) in seedlings were down-regulated significantly (>2-fold expression change). However, the expression levels of ATGs were usually up-regulated with a few exceptions in seedlings by other five hormones tested. After NAA treatment, the expression levels of six ATGs (NtATG2, NtATG5, NtATG9, NtATG13c, NtATG18f and NtVPS34) showed a significant increase (>2-fold expression change). The expression levels of five ATGs (NtATG2, NtATG5, NtATG9, NtATG13c and NtVPS34) and four ATGs (NtATG2, NtATG9, NtATG13c and NtVPS34) were increased significantly (>2-fold expression change) after 2, 4-D and ABA treatments, respectively. In addition, 4 ATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG18a, NtATG18c and NtATG18e) and 11 ATGs (NtATG1a, NtATG2, NtATG9, NtATG13b, NtATG13c, NtATG18a, NtATG18b, NtATG18c, NtATG18e, NtVPS15 and NtVPS34) were up-regulated (>2-fold expression change) by SA and JA, respectively. That is to say, these five plant hormones (NAA, 2,4-D, ABA, SA and JA) usually exert opposite effects on the regulation of ATG expression compared with GA3, implying that they may have common mechanism on regulating autophagy occurrences in the process of plant development, but differ from that of GA3.

Relative expression levels of each ATG in seedlings under different hormone treatments were normalized to GAPDH (AJ133422), Polyubiquitin (GQ281244), Actin (GQ281246) and Elongation factor 1a (AF120093). The expression level of each ATG was calculated and compared with that in seedlings under normal growth conditions.

DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation process among yeast, mammals and plants.4,6 A set of genes involved in this process are called ATGs and has been extensively studied in yeast and mammals. More than 30 ATGs have been identified until now, and analyses of them unveiled multiple roles of autophagy and diverse aspects of molecular mechanism underlying it.3 On the basis of sequence similarity to autophagy-related proteins in yeast and mammals, 39 ATGs belonging to 20 different groups in A. thaliana5,6 and 33 ATGs belonging to 13 different groups in O. sativa7 were identified, respectively, suggesting the core components of autophagy are conserved among different species. In addition, these ATGs could be divided into four major functional groups including ATG1 kinase complex group, ATG9 recycling complex, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) complex and ubiquitin-like conjugation system. However, the roles of them in plant development and in response to dynamic environment, as well as conservation of autophagy between monocotyledon and dicotyledon, are still largely unknown.Nicotiana tabacum has been used as an ideal model plant for the study of autophagy in plants for many years.20–22 However, only a few ATGs have been identified up to now in tobacco. To facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanism regulating autophagy, it is necessary to identify all the ATGs in tobacco genome. Thus, in the present study, 30 ATGs belonging to 16 different classes according to the sequence similarity to ATGs of A. thaliana have been identified. No homologues of ATG7 and ATG12 have been identified in the present study based on the draft genomic sequences of N. tabacum deposited in NCBI, and no EST sequences covering ATG7 and ATG12 were found according to available data. Most of the ATGs (ATG2, ATG3, ATG4, ATG5, ATG6, ATG9, ATG10, ATG20, VPS15 and VPS34) comprise single member. Only a few of them (ATG1, ATG8, ATG13, ATG18 and VTI12) contain multiple members, ranging from two to six in different groups (Table 1). However, majority of ATGs in O. sativa have multiple isoforms with four exceptions (ATG5, ATG7, ATG12 and ATG16), indicating that plants may have species-specific mechanism regulating autophagy. In N. tabacum, the compositions of domain within each class are similar with two exceptions (ATG1 and ATG18), suggesting possible functional redundancy of different members in the same group. ATG1c shows a similar serine/threonine-protein kinase domain at N-terminal with 1a and 1b, but lacks a similar C-terminal structure that in ATG1a and 1b. Meanwhile, all members in the ATG18 group show a similar N-terminal structure, but lacking of a C-terminal BCAS3 domain in ATG18d, ATG18e and ATG18f, suggesting the functional divergence of different members in the same class. In a recent work, two different members in the Cysteine Proteases ATG4 group (AtAtg4a and AtAtg4b) of A. thaliana were approved to selectively cleavage different AtAtg8 substrates. AtAtg4a is more active when processing substrates AtAtg8a, AtAtg8c, AtAtg8d and AtAtg8i better than AtAtg4b in vitro, but displays similar levels with AtAtg4b when processing other AtAtg8 substrates,33 suggesting the function divergence of ATGs in the same group. In the present study, we found that the responses of ATGs in the same group to different environmental signals are distinct. Hence, the conserved and specific functions of ATGs in the same group need to be elucidated in the further study.During past decades, autophagy has been shown to play roles in the adaption of plant to different stresses, including nutrient starvation, oxidative stress, drought, salt and other abiotic stresses in plants.6 Among them, nitrogen deficiency, starvation and darkness stress in relation to autophagy were most extensively explored, and have been used as model systems for the study of plant autophagy.34 It was reported that autophagy could be induced by nutrient starvation and is critical for nutrient remobilization.35 The relative expression levels of some ATGs were increased significantly under the condition of nutrient starvation. In A. thaliana, the transcriptional levels of ATGs in the ATG8 conjugation pathway were transiently unregulated in a co-ordinated manner by starvation.36 In O. sativa, the expression levels of ATGs were also reported to be induced by starvation stresses.7 However, not all ATGs in the ATG8 conjugation pathway were synergistically unregulated in O. sativa. In the present study, the responses of 30 ATGs in tobacco to carbon and nitrogen starvation were also investigated. Surprisingly, none of ATGs in the ATG8 conjugation pathway was induced by carbon and nitrogen starvation. However, we found that ATGs in ATG1 kinase, ATG9 recycling and PI3K complex were coordinately unregulated by both carbon and nitrogen starvation, e.g. ATG13s in ATG1 complex and ATG18s in ATG9 complex and three members of PI3K complex, which play critical roles in the initial stages of autophagy. Early study in A. thaliana showed that eight ATG18 genes were differentially expressed in response to different growth conditions, and only ATG18a was induced by both sucrose and nitrogen starvation, which is likely required for autophagosome formation.11 However, six members of ATG18 gene are commonly unregulated by both carbon and nitrogen starvation in N. tabacum, introducing a possibility that different members of ATG18 may cooperate in starvation induced autophagy. In addition, the responses of ATGs to different stresses including starvation, cold, drought, salt and heavy metals were also detected and compared with one another. We found that several ATGs (ATG1a, ATG2, ATG13c, ATG18a, ATG18c and VPS34) are commonly up-regulated by all abiotic stresses tested. Interestingly, all these ATGs also belong to ATG1 kinase, ATG9 recycling and PI3K complex, which suggested that a central role of ATG1 kinase, ATG9 recycling and PI3K complex as an effector in plant response to different stresses. In contrast, we also found that several ATGs are responsive only to specific stress in the present study. Interestingly, the conserved autophagy machinery could play its role in responses to different stresses, whereas several ATGs only response to specific stresses. This seems contradictory and remains a question with great interesting for further study. Two possible mechanisms might explain this phenomenon. The first is that the transcription of each ATG in different conditions may be controlled by a set of different transcriptional factors, which show different responses to various stress conditions. Another possibility is that external signals could regulate the autophagy via regulating the partners of ATGs, rather than regulate ATG expression itself. In a recent report, an ATG3-interacting protein cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPCs) has been identified, and the interaction between them was affected by ROS, which was reported to have the ability to induce autophagy.37 In this case, ATGs may not directly response to some stresses.Plant hormones, as the major regulators in the different processes of plant development, have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of PCD.38 Two different classes of PCD, vacuolar cell death and necrosis, could be distinguished according to morphological characteristics.39 Necrosis usually occurs under abiotic stresses, whereas vacuolar cell death, an autophagy-like process, is common during the processes of plant development.39 Four major phytohormones, including SA, JA, GA3 and ABA, have been reported as PCD-signal regulators. SA has been approved as a well-known mediator in hypersensitive cell death,40 and JA usually functions in biotic stress-induced PCD.41–43 However, the links of plant hormones to autophagy-like vacuolar cell death remain to be elucidated. There are a few reports, indicating that GA3 and ABA were involved in the regulation of vacuolar cell death.38 In addition, the relationship between phytohormones and autophagy is also largely unknown. There are only some pioneer researches related to the relationship between phytohormones and autophagy. For example, autophagy was approved to be involved in the response to ABA.44 In a recent report, SA signalling pathway was also shown to be required for early senescence in atg mutant.12 In the present study, the responses of ATGs to ABA and SA were analysed first. The expression levels of several ATGs increased in seedlings after treatment by ABA and SA, respectively. However, no ATG gene responded to both ABA and SA synchronously, suggesting that ABA and SA regulate autophagy via different mechanisms. In addition, the responses of ATGs to other four phytohormones including NAA, 2, 4-D, GA3 and JA were comprehensively studied and compared with one another. The data implied that some ATGs are response to phytohormones and most of them are regulated by NAA, 2, 4-D and ABA, implying a common role of autophagy in the response to different phytohormones. The exact role of autophagy in plant response to phytohormones and the linkage between autophagy and phytohormone signals are worthy to be elucidated in the further works.On the other hand, there are growing evidences indicating additional crucial roles of autophagy in plant development under normal conditions, including leaf starch degradation,8 lifespan extension,14 vacuolar cell death of embryo suspensor,27 lipid metabolism regulation, anther development18 and maintenance of peroxisomal quality.15–17 In the present study, expression profile analysis of ATGs in tobacco shows that the transcripts of all ATGs could be detected in all tissues tested, but the transcriptional levels of ATGs vary among different tissues especially in the processes of seed formation, which have not yet been analysed in both O. sativa and A. thaliana. The expression profile analysis results implied that autophagy has more extensive roles than we thought in plant development under normal conditions, particularly in seed development. However, clear roles of autophagy in seed development are largely unknown up to date. There are only two examples implying the role of autophagy in embryo development. In P. abies, autophagy has been reported to be necessary for vacuolar cell death of embryo suspensor, which is essential for normal embryogenesis. Silencing of ATG5 or ATG6 abrogates normal suspensor formation and consequent embryo development.27 Autophagy has also been reported to have a role in microspore embryogenesis.45 Electron microscopy observation and dansylcadaverine staining revealed that autophagy exclusively occurs in embryogenic microspores, but not in other microspore-derived structures.45 Hence, the exact roles of autophagy in seed formation including embryogenesis, endosperm development and seed coat development are worthy to be elucidated in the further study.In addition, our expression profile analysis of ATGs in tobacco revealed that a relatively higher expression level of most ATGs in pollen/anther compared with that in other tissues tested, suggesting a potential role of autophagy in male gametophyte development. It was reported that AtATG6, one of the components of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex, has been approved to be essential for pollen germination.46–48 Two other members of the PtdIns3K complex, VPS1549 and VPS34,50 were also shown to be important for pollen germination in A. thaliana. However, ATG6, VPS15 and VPS34 commonly exist in two separate complexes that regulate either autophagy or the vacuolar protein sorting pathway. In addition, the knockout mutants of other ATG genes in A. thaliana are fertile and display normal life cycle, indicating that the defects in pollen germination of ATG6, VPS15 and VPS34 are likely not attributing to the deficiency of autophagic activity in pollen. However, the contribution of autophagy to plant developmental processes may vary among different species. In P. abies, autophagy has been reported to be necessary for vacuolar cell death of embryo suspensor.27 In addition, ATG7-knockout mutant with defects in autophagy and sporophytic male sterility has also been identified in rice.18 Hence, the comparison of the roles of autophagy in different systems might be a charming work for understanding molecular mechanism underlying autophagy.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31400171 and 31270362).

IntroductionDomestication of pigs originated from local wild boar populations in Europe and Asia circa 10,000 yrs ago1 and occurred independently from wild boar subspecies in Europe and Asia.2 There are hundreds of domestic pig breeds available across the world, and pigs have served as one of the most important sources of animal protein for humans. Since the last century, traditional selective breeding has contributed significantly to the genetic improvement of economically important traits in pigs. For example, substantial improvements were achieved in pigs per sow per year (annually +0.25) and the feed conversion ratio (annually -0.009 to -0.070 kg of the dry matter intake per live mass gain kg) during recent decades.3,4 Furthermore, some pig breeds have been used as mammalian model animals for the biomedical research because of their physiological and anatomical similarities to humans, and for developing several swine lines, including highly inbred miniature pig breeds.5,6 However, most of the achievements were made in European origin breeds, whereas, there are fewer systematic genetic improvement programs for diverse Asian local breeds.There are two types of Korean indigenous pigs currently registered with the worldwide Domestic Animal Diversity Information System of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: Chookjin Chamdon and Jeju native pig.7 However, they are generally termed as the Korean native pig because of their same origin until the middle of the last century. Korean native pigs are known for their peculiar characteristics including higher intramuscular fat contents and chewy texture, which are appealing palatability factors to Korean pork consumers. However, they also have poorer productivities, such as lower growth rates and litters per sow per year than typical imported breeds, such as Duroc and Yorkshire.8,9 Since the beginning of the last century, the native breeds have been endangered, especially because of the extensive crossbreeding with economically promising imported breeds. To conserve the native genetic resource, recent efforts have been made by the National Institute of Animal Science (NIAS) in Korea to restore and manage the Korean native population.10 The Korean native pig is genetically more closely related to other Asian native pigs than to most European origin pigs.11 Kim et al.12 further showed that it might have a distinct genetic distance even from some Chinese native pig breeds.The completion of the swine sequencing project has resulted in many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being identified throughout the genome.1 The recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to further cataloguing of SNPs by resequencing of diverse pig breeds or multiple animals in comparison with the reference sequence assembly. Furthermore, the SNPs derived from NGS have been used successfully to dissect genomic characteristics of pigs. For example, Rubin et al. revealed significant signatures of selection in pig genomes by scanning whole genomes using SNPs.13 In addition, three Berkshire pigs were resequenced recently to explore their genetic relationship with 38 pig genomes obtained from the public database, providing useful information on the breed's origin and domestication.14In this study, we present whole-genome sequencing analyses of 55 pigs of five breeds, including Korean wild boar, Korean native, Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire. Substantial numbers of SNPs were identified across the genome using the Swine reference assembly (Sus scrofa 10.2). SNP sets derived from the whole-genome sequencing were used to explore genomic characteristics among the diverse pig breeds and to detect genomic regions potentially implicated in the strong selective breeding applied to the pig populations in this study.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sampling and DNA extractionWe sequenced 55 animals from five pig breeds, including 10 Korean wild boars, 10 Korean native pigs (4 boars and 6 sows), 6 Duroc pigs (3 boars and 3 sows), 14 Landrace pigs (7 boars and 7 sows), and 15 Yorkshire pigs (7 boars and 8 sows) for this study (Table 1). The Korean native pigs were accessed at the Swine Science Division, NIAS, Rural Development Administration (RDA), Suwon; and the Subtropical Animal Experiment Station in NIAS, RDA, Jeju. The Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire pig samples were collected at the NIAS and Sunjin Co., Ltd in Korea. The Korean wild boars were captured in either Gyeonggi or Gyeongsangnam Provinces in South Korea, sampling five animals from each province, respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples in EDTA using a Wizard Genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The genomic DNA of the Korean wild boars was extracted from meat samples. The quality and quantity of the DNA were evaluated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA) and gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was checked using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen, USA). The National Institute of Animal Science's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee reviewed and approved the study protocol and standard operating procedures (No. 2009-077, C-grade).

Library construction and sequencingDNA libraries were constructed to have insert sizes of ~300 bp, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (paired-end 101-bp reads) and Illumina GA IIx platform (paired-end 100-bp reads). We generated 24,932,652,290 reads (2,518 Gb) from 55 samples. Each sample was sequenced to have over >34 Gb initial reads to produce a minimum of 10-fold genomic coverage.2.3. Mapping, SNP calling, and annotationThe sequenced reads were mapped to the Swine reference genome assembly (Sscrofa10.2) using Burrows Wheeler Aligner version 0.5.9 with default options.15 The genome sequence was downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/susScr3/bigZips/susScr3.fa.gz). We also screened the unmapped reads and the reads that were aligned to unplaced scaffolds. Of the aligned reads, removal of polymerase chain reaction duplicates and re-synchronization of the mate information were performed using MarkDuplicates and FixMateInformation in the Picard software package version 1.48 (http://picard.sourceforge.net/), respectively. Local alignment around indels was performed to the duplication-removed reads using RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner in the Genome Analysis Toolkit16 (GATK; version 1.0.5974). Furthermore, basepair quality scores were recalibrated using CountCovariates and TableRecalibration in the GATK.16 Multi-sample SNP genotyping was performed to identify SNPs using UnifiedGenotyper in GATK. To reduce the false discovery rate, the filtering steps followed these criteria: QUAL < 30.0, QD < 2.0, MQ < 40.0, FS > 60.0, HaplotypeScore > 13.0, MQRankSum < -12.5, and ReadPosRankSum < -8.0. All the filtered SNPs were annotated to belong to 12 functional categories (Table 2) using an SNP annotation tool, snpEff and snpSift version 3.6c,17,18 and the Ensembl Sus scrofa gene set version 75 (Sscrofa10.2.75). For the gene set, the canonical genes were applied to the annotation with the ‘-canon’ option in the snpEff program. Non-synonymous SNPs that had a SIFT score <0.05 were classified as potentially damaging variants. SIFT scores for the Sus scrofa gene set were downloaded from SIFT 4G (SIFT Databases for Genomes; http://sift-dna.org).

Phylogeny and admixture analysisTo perform phylogenetic and admixture analyses, haplotypes of all the animals in this study were inferred by an imputation tool, BEAGLE, version 3.3.2.19 The phased haplotypes based on the SNPs were used to conduct phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was generated using neighbour-joining tree estimation with pairwise distance, and Kimura's two-parameter distance method implemented in Analysis of Phylogenetic and Evolution (version 3.0.6) in R language.20 The tree was plotted using MEGA5,21 and the population structures were accessed by admixture analysis using the STRUCTURE version 2.3.4, which is based on the maximum likelihood method.22 We used different values of K (number of putative ancestral clusters of allelic similarity) and an admixture model with a correlated allele frequency to assign the K clusters.23 A 30,000 burn-in period of Chain Monte Carlo searches followed by 20,000 replicate runs were performed at each K from 2 to 5. The result was then plotted using DISTRUCT version 1.1.24 The pairwise similarity between each animal was computed by the number of the same SNP genotypes divided by the total number of SNPs. The order of the 55 animals for the STRUCTURE plot and the similarity matrix followed the same order used in the phylogenetic tree.2.5. Identification of selective sweepsTo identify putative selective sweeps, we searched genomic regions with higher degrees of fixation, following the method by Rubin et al.13,25 The number of major and minor allele sequence reads were counted at each of the identified SNP in each breed. We filtered the SNP positions whose minor allele frequency was <0.05. We then scanned the genome using 50% overlapping windows of 150 kb in size, which was successfully adopted in the previous pig resequencing study.25 Among the 150 kb windows, we excluded windows with fewer than 10 of the number of heterozygous SNPs in each breed. Briefly, the Pooled heterozygosity (Hp) was initially computed by an equation: 2*sum_maj*sum_min/(sum_maj+ sum_min),2 where sum_maj and sum_min are the sum of major and minor allele frequency at the given 150 kb window, using the numbers of reference and alternative allele sequence reads observed in each of the breeds. The ZHp score was calculated from Z transformation of the Hp score as described by Rubin et al.13,252.6. Validation of SNPs by genotyping chip arrayTo validate the accuracy of SNP calling from whole-genome sequencing of five pig breeds, we genotyped five animals per each breed using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 v2 Genotyping BeadChip. Of the 64,232 SNP probes in the chip, we selected 44,903 probes that were successfully located on the autosomal and sex chromosomes. The reference allele of a chip SNP was set to the allele that is equal to the base at the reference genome, Sus scrofa 10.2. The genotype concordance was measured for each animal by the number of concordant genotypes between the SNP chip and the whole-genome sequencing derived SNPs divided by the total number of the SNP probes. The method was referred from GATK online documentation for VariantEval (http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/48/using-varianteval).2.7. Data accessAll SNPs detected in this study have been submitted to the NCBI dbSNP with the accession numbers: ss1754731760–ss1774855430.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and read mappingWe extracted genomic DNA from 55 pigs of five breeds including Korean wild boar (KWB), Korean native (KNP), Duroc (DUR), Landrace (LAN), and Yorkshire (YOR). Approximately 24.9 billion reads were generated by short-read sequencing technology including the Illumina GA IIx and HiSeq 2000 sequencing platforms. This equated to ~2.52 terabases and 897-fold coverage compared with the expected genome size of the Swine reference genome (Sscrofa 10.2; size ~2.8 Gb). To detect high-quality SNPs from all the samples, we sequenced at least 34 Gb for each of the samples. Of the 55 sequenced animals, the least amount of sequence reads was 12.1-fold for the ‘DUR5’ individual. After mapping the reads to the reference genome, we removed erroneous sequence reads that were caused by potential polymerase chain reaction duplication (17.5%). This yielded ~16.6 billion reads (1,673.1 Gb), covering 99.2% of the reference assembly at an average of 11.7-fold coverage across the covered region (Table 1). There was no outstanding coverage bias observed on any specific chromosome within each of the animals.3.2. SNP detectionWe identified a total of 20,123,573 SNPs throughout the genomes from all the 55 sequenced pigs of the five breeds in this study. The number of SNPs in each breed population varied from 6.6 to 14.0 million; the least number of the SNP set was observed in DUR, while the most values were found in KWB (Table 2). This was as expected, because the DUR was the breed used to construct the Sscrofa 10.2 reference assembly, and the KWB is the most genetically distant of the pig breeds in this study.1,25 In addition, we do not rule out the possibility that parts of the SNPs could be caused by the within-population variation in this study. Of the total SNPs, ~25.5% were found to be novel, as assessed by the dbSNP build 137 (Fig. 1a). Correspondingly, KWB showed the highest percentage of novel SNPs (24.9%) compared with the other four breeds (16.4, 13.6, 16.7, and 16.1% for KNP, DUR, LAN, and YOR, respectively). These values indicated that many SNPs remain to be identified by further sequencing efforts, although numerous SNPs have accumulated since the recent completion of the swine sequencing project. The quality of the detected SNPs was examined by calculating the transition-to-transversion ratio (Ti/Tv) for each SNP (Table 2) as well as experimental validation performing a concordance test. The Ti/Tv ratio has been used as an indicator of potential sequencing errors, and it has been empirically approximated to around 2.1 and 2.2 in recent resequencing studies in Humans and cattle, respectively.26–28 Following the previous studies, Ti/Tv ratios for most of the pigs are in accordance with the values observed in the Human and cattle, with no outstanding values (KWB: 1.97, KNP: 1.92, DUR: 1.91, LAN: 1.93, YOR: 1.92). Furthermore, we genotyped a part of the same individuals sequenced in this study, using the Illumina PorcineSNP60K BeadChip to perform a concordance test between the SNP panel genotype and SNPs derived from this study. A total of 44,903 SNPs were used for the concordance test to show high concordance rates (98.8–99.4%), which is reliable enough for further investigations (Supplementary Table S1). These results well suggested that most of the SNPs identified in this study were reasonably accurate. Overview of the identified SNPs.

SNP annotation and gene of interestAll the detected SNPs were annotated functionally using Ensembl gene annotation and dbSNP databases, assigning them to 12 functional classes. In agreement with previous studies, most of the SNPs were located in intergenic and intron regions (74.1 and 24.6% respectively), while fewer SNPs (1.3%) resided within exonic region, including exonic, splice sites, and untranslated regions (Fig. 1b and Table 2). Among the genic SNPs, we identified a substantial number (35,458) of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in a total of 9,904 genes, which could be associated with traits of interest in pigs (Supplementary Table S2). To prioritize the nsSNPs, all the nsSNPs were further assigned a SIFT score to classify the effects of each nsSNP on phenotypic functions, based on the amino acid conservation.29 According to the typical interpretation of the score, a score of =0.05 classifies an nsSNP as ‘damaging’ and a score of >0.05 corresponds to ‘tolerant’. There were 6,849 damaging and 27,215 tolerant nsSNPs in our data (Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, we extracted nsSNP sets that did not overlap among the breeds in this study (breed-specific nsSNP) and identified 126, 26, 11, 10, and 8 for KWB, KNP, DUR, LAN, and YOR, respectively (Supplementary Table S3).Of the breed-specific nsSNP, we identified several interesting nsSNPs that may be implicated with economically important traits in the pig. For example, a YOR-specific novel nsSNP (SIFT score: 0.03; 6,916,234 bp on chromosome 2) was located in the phospholipase C, beta 3 gene (PLCB3). PLCB3 is involved in the mammalian oocyte at fertilization, spermatozoa activation, and embryonic lethality in sea urchin and mouse studies.30–32 Notably, the Yorkshire (YOR) has been widely used as a maternal line breed, particularly for its large litter size; thus, the SNP in PLCB3 is a candidate SNP to account for genetic variation in the reproduction trait, whose genetic effects have been difficult to predict. Little is known about which genes affect litter size, which has a low heritability and is a highly appreciated trait in the pig industry.33,34 A homozygous SNP was found in all 10 KWB individuals sequenced in this study (GG against the A reference allele). Interestingly, the same pattern was observed in the European wild boar samples, while the G allele frequency is around 33% in the Asian wild boars in a recent independent study (Dr Martien Groenen, personal communication). The gene affected by the SNP has homology to Neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family, member 4 (NXPE4). Members of the NXPE family are neuropeptides that potentially signal via alpha-neurexins.35 It could be hypothesized that the NXPE4 homolog is involved in neurological mechanisms associated with temperament or fear, whose genetic mechanisms are poorly understood in pigs. Although it is beyond the scope of this study to conclude how each of the genes are affected by the nsSNPs, the many damaging nsSNPs identified provide ample information to identify promising candidates for further studies to dissect genetic mechanisms of diverse traits in pigs.3.4. Phylogenetic and admixture analysisTo examine the population structure and genetic relationships of the five breeds, we carried out multiple analyses, including phylogenetic analysis by neighbour-joining estimation, similarity estimation by comparison of genotypes, and admixture analysis using the STRUCTURE program. All five breeds were consistently separated by those three methods, as expected. The wild boar (KWB) was mostly distinguished from the four domesticated breeds (KNP, DUR, LAN, and YOR), and a clear genetic distance was also observed within the domesticated breeds with the respect to each breed (Fig. 2a). The result was further supported by the similarity matrix, which showed genotyping similarity of <41% between all the KWBs and the domesticated breed individuals. KWB appears to be genetically closer to KNP than any other breed, as shown in both the phylogenetic tree and similarity matrix. The similarity level between KWB and KNP varied from 38.8 to 41%, while that between KWB and the other three breeds was 36.7–38.9%. We observed the maximum value of the genotyping similarity (~70%) across the domestic breeds, while the minimum values within each breed were >70%, except for the KNP (minimum value = 68.1%). In the STRUCTURE analysis, we found the best-fit value of K as 5 to estimate the most likely number of genetic clusters, which corresponded to the number of breeds used in the study. While observing obvious genetic differentiation among the breeds, LAN and YOR have partially shared genetic differentiation signals; YOR shared 4–12.5% of LAN and LAN shared 8.3–31.5% of the YOR. Interestingly, among the 10 KNP individuals, six animals (Chookjin Chamdon, KNP Nos. 1–6) appeared to be genetically distant from the other four KNPs (Jeju native pig, KNP Nos. 7–10) that share other breed populations (11.3–14.6, 12.8–17.3, and 11.4–13.3% for DUR, LAN, and YOR, respectively). The result was found consistently in the phylogenetic tree, similarity matrix, and STRUCTURE analyses in this study. KNPs can be classified as two subgroups with respect to their geographical location in Korea, and they have been bred separately for ~50 yrs. Despite their same origin until the last century, this result may imply that the Chookjin Chamdon and Jeju native have discernable genetic differences that may be caused by their geographical isolation and different environments. In addition, we did not rule out the possibility that the native breed may have been affected by unrecorded crossbreeding with imported breeds before the systematic management of the native genetic resources.

Selective sweep analysisThe whole genomes were scanned to identify genomic regions with excess homozygosity as indicative of a signature of selection in each breed. By applying 50% overlapping windows of 150 kb in size, 32,651 windows were used in the genome scanning. All the detected SNPs in each breed were used to calculate the ZHp. Altogether, 236, 472, 1,568, 383, and 363 windows were removed that had fewer than 10 SNPs in KWB, KNP, DUR, LAN, and YOR, respectively. In each breed, the ZHp values varied from -4.83 to 2.73, -3.19 to 1.58, -2.57 to 1.45, -3.60 to 2.07, and -3.54 to 1.98 (Supplementary Figure S1), and we observed 1,277, 1,219, 656, 759, and 904 windows with ZHp values lower than -2 for KWB, KNP, DUR, LAN, and YOR, respectively (Supplementary Table S4–S8). An extremely low ZHp score is indicative of a selective sweep; therefore, we further accessed windows having low ZHp scores. Thus, we located several convincing loci that are potentially implicated with the selection applied on each breed. For example, the Claudin-1 (CLDN1) gene is located on chromosome 13 (Position: 136,971,662–136,987,446 bp), and windows including the gene (bin#: 1,815 and 1,826) exhibited a putative signature of selection in both LAN (ZHp = -1.81 and -2.96) and YOR (ZHp = -2.64 and -2.53) pigs (Supplementary Table S5 and S6). The CLDN1 genomic region was further examined by accessing pooled heterozygosity (Hp) calculated from each allele of the 142 SNPs that were identified in the region (Fig. 3c). Given that Hp scores of 0 and 0.5 indicate complete homozygosity and heterozygosity, respectively, three breeds other than the LAN and YOR showed distinctively lower homozygosity at the CLDN1. The CLDN1 is a dominant tight junction protein that plays a role in invasion activity during metastasis, and its biological functions are known to maintain pregnancy and facilitate conceptus attachment.36,37 Note that, of the five breeds in this study, both LAN and YOR are outstanding maternal line breeds, with superior reproduction traits. In addition, a recent report showed that the Claudin family members are expressed more abundantly in Yorkshire pigs, as assessed using the porcine Affymetrix-Chip, suggesting that it may be implicated with successful conceptus attachment in this breed.38Z-scores of pooled heterozygosity (ZHp) overlapping the CLDN1 gene region.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.As another example, we found a signature of selection for a locus on Chromosome 9 (window #1296), which includes the twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 gene (TWIST1). The genomic region showed a distinctly lower ZHp of -3.02 in KNP (Supplementary Table S5) compared with the other four breed populations (0.78, -1.17, 0.85, and 0.53 for KWB, DUR, LAN, and YOR, respectively). TWIST1 is implicated in cell lineage differentiation and is associated with breast cancer and Saethre–Chotzen syndrome in humans.39,40 Furthermore, its expression was low in obese subjects and increased after weight loss, suggesting a prospective role in obesity.41,42 Despite its lower growth rate and litter size, KNP is known to have the higher intramuscular fat content (marbling) than typical imported breeds. The marbling is an important palatability factor appealing to many Korean pork consumers; however, limited numbers of genes have been identified to account for genetic variations in the trait in KNP. These examples show the potential of our analysis to identify candidate genes to dissect genetic mechanisms implicated in economically important traits in diverse pig breeds (Fig. 4).

ConclusionsHere, we present extensive whole-genome resequencing analyses for 55 pigs of five breeds: Korean wild boar, Korean native, Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire. This study had two main findings. First, we identified a significant number of SNPs across the genomes (~20.1 million), of which substantial numbers were novel. Furthermore, we located numerous nsSNPs using a deep annotation process, which could be candidate genetic markers for predicting genetic variations in traits of interest. Second, multiple methodologies were applied to the detected SNPs to dissect genomic features of the pig breeds, revealing obvious signals of genetic differentiation among the breeds. Furthermore, the whole genomes were scanned to detect signatures of selection by accessing excess homozygosity throughout the genome. We observed many higher homozygosity regions, which are unevenly distributed across the genome. The results allowed us to retrieve several interesting genomic regions that may be associated with economically important traits in pigs.Authors’ contributionJ.W.C., W.H.C., and K.T.L. wrote the article.

IntroductionCirculating tumour DNA (ctDNA), which is the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from dying cancer cells to the blood, is an emerging topic in cancer research. Several proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that ctDNA could be used as a biomarker to monitor tumour burdens1 or acquired drug resistance.2–4 From a biological viewpoint, ctDNA is regarded as a carrier that brings the genetic information of solid tumours to peripheral blood. The use of ctDNA is expected to facilitate the analysis of genetic tumour heterogeneity,5 such as the evolution of cancer cells during the disease course, because of the difficulty in sampling recurrent or metastatic tissues. On average, cfDNA is fragmented to a size of 170 bp,6 and its half-life is estimated to be 16.5 min.7 One millilitre of blood contains the cfDNA from one to several thousand genomes. The rare mutations resulting from cancer cells must be detected in the vast amount of DNA from normal cells and quantitated.Although various techniques have been used to detect ctDNA, digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR)8 and related technologies, particularly massively parallel DNA sequencers, are becoming the method of choice. In the case of massively parallel sequencers, the high read error rate of the current technologies is a major problem. Sequencing multiple sites or genomic regions dramatically increases the number of false positives, which is one of the reasons why current ctDNA assays tend to restrict their target to one or a few mutation sites.6,9,10 Another problem is the global amplification step during the template preparation for massively parallel sequencing. The final sequence reads do not represent the original DNA population, and the number of reads usually exceeds the number of target DNA molecules. Consequently, the quantitation of mutation alleles may be affected.These problems can be solved using barcode sequences.11,12 Labelling DNA fragments with barcode sequences, typically N10–15, provides discrimination between the reads from individual molecules, thus enabling grouping of the reads from each molecule. Constructing a consensus of reads leads to both high-fidelity DNA sequencing and the capability to count the number of sequenced molecules. The main problem is the read errors that are introduced into barcode sequences, which can affect the basic principle of labelling each molecule with a single unique barcode. This problem has been recognized, and small collections of barcode sequences have been designed to detect and exclude erroneous sequences.13,14 However, this approach requires each barcode sequence to be individually manufactured. Therefore, it cannot accommodate large numbers of sequences.As a first attempt, we focused on cancer-related genes that are frequently mutated, that is TP53 and KRAS, and we developed a system for de novo detection and absolute quantitation of mutations in plasma cfDNA. This system consists of the following two steps:
We named the collection of final consensus reads as ‘non-overlapping integrated reads (NOIR)’. The performance of the sequencing system, named the NOIR sequencing system, was demonstrated using plasma cfDNA from patients with gastric or lung cancer.A novel target sequencing method that adds barcode sequences by adaptor ligation. This method uses linear amplification to eliminate the errors introduced during the early cycles of PCR.The monitoring and removal of erroneous barcode tags. This process involves the identification of individual molecules that have been sequenced and for which the number of mutations has been absolutely quantitated.2. Materials and methods2.1. DNA samplesWe used Megapool Reference male DNA (Kreatech Biotechnology, Amsterdam, Netherlands), which is a pool of DNA from 100 normal Caucasian males, for technical development. The genomic DNA of leucocytes from normal individuals and the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma cell line, which has an R280W mutation in the TP53 gene,15 was extracted using a standard phenol/chloroform protocol. Patients with activating EGFR mutations in lung cancer tissues were recruited at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.16 A gastric cancer patient was recruited at Osaka University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients recruited to this study. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases and Osaka University Hospital.Plasma was prepared via centrifugation of 4–5 ml of EDTA-treated blood at 800 g for 10 min at room temperature. The plasma was transferred to a fresh tube and re-centrifuged at 15,100 g for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the upper plasma was transferred to a fresh tube. The centrifuged liquid samples were frozen at -80°C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from 1.5 to 2.0 ml of a liquid sample using the QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For several samples, the DNA concentration was determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, CA, USA).2.2. Target regions, adaptors and region-specific primersWe designed adaptors and primers to analyse the genomic regions that code for the DNA-binding domain of TP53 and for the mutation hotspots of KRAS and CTNNB1 (Supplementary Tables S1–S3).2.3. Library construction with linear amplification of the barcoded strandsGenomic DNA (5–40 ng) or cfDNA (from ~1 ml of whole blood) was digested using multiple restriction enzymes [Set1: AlwNI and Alw26I; Set2: EarI and NcoI; SetKC: EarI and NmuCI (FastDigest enzymes, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA); Supplementary Table S1]. The ligation of adaptors with N12 barcode sequence tags was performed using Escherichia coli DNA ligase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The ligation products were purified twice with a 1.2× volume of AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Linear amplification of the purified products was performed with a region-specific primer mixture (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) and Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) by 10 thermal cycles. The purified linear amplification products were amplified with the PGM/Proton primers (Supplementary Table S2) and Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Life Technologies). The amplification products were purified with AMPureXP beads or agarose gel electrophoresis with a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Further details and library construction for experiments with double strand labeling are provided in Supplementary Methods.2.4. Massively parallel sequencingFor the Ion Torrent sequencing system, we prepared sequencing templates (emulsion PCR and bead-enrichment) from sequencing libraries using an Ion PI Template OT2 200 Kit v2 or v3 (Life Technologies) and an Ion OneTouch system (Ion OneTouch Instrument and Ion OneTouch ES, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prepared templates were sequenced using an Ion PI Sequencing 200 Kit v2 or v3 and the Proton sequencer (Life Technologies). Torrent Suite 4.0 or 4.2 (Life Technologies) was used to convert the raw signals into base calls and to extract the FASTQ files of the sequencing reads. Sequencing data from the Illumina system were generated using a MiSeq system (Illumina, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the FASTQ files of single-end reads were extracted.2.5. Data analysisReads in FASTQ format were divided using 5-bp indices for individual assignments. Sequences between the 5-bp indexes and spacer sequences were obtained as barcode tags. When the total length of the spacer and the following sequence was >70 bases, the reads were aligned to target sequences (spacer + target region) with bwa (version 0.6.2) using the bwasw mode for aligning long reads17 and the parameter setting ‘-b5 -q2 -r1 -z10’. Reads with long unmapped ends (>10% of the total read length) were discarded.Barcode tags from mapped reads were analysed in each target region. Although we designed 12-bp barcode tags, we obtained tags that were not 12-bp in length due to insertion/deletion errors that were detected during sequencing. We discarded tags that were <9 bp. To recover the maximum number of reads, 11- and 13-bp tags that only differed from a 12-bp tag by the insertion or deletion of a single base were grouped with the corresponding 12-bp tag. For example, ‘TGCATGATACG’ and ‘TGCATGGATTACG’ were combined with the barcode group ‘TGCATGATTACG’.Reads with the same barcode sequences were grouped together, and the barcode tags were assigned into 2-read bins according to the number of reads per tag. Then, the proportion of 12-bp tags in each bin was calculated, and the value (proportion) for each bin was averaged using the 11 bins around that bin. We defined the minimum bin as that with an average proportion of 90% or greater, and we set this value as the threshold for removing erroneous barcode tags. These processes were performed using an in-house Perl script.After the removal of erroneous tags that had fewer reads than the threshold, the reads from tags with the same barcode were combined using samtools (version 0.1.18),18 and consensus sequences were created using VarScan (v2.2.11).19 If >50 reads were obtained, the longest 50 reads were analysed. If >80% of reads had an alternative base at a position, we assigned a variant. A set of consensus sequences was converted to a FASTQ file, and we assigned ‘57’ as a quality score for all bases. A FASTQ file was aligned to the sequences of target regions as described above, and the generated mapping data were processed to obtain the per base coverage (pileup files) using samtools. Subsequently, we summarized the base counts for each base position.The sequence error rate was calculated by dividing the number of non-reference sequenced bases by the number of all sequenced bases in the target regions. When using barcode tags, consensus sequences of multiple reads from individual molecules were analysed. Reads before constructing consensus were used for deep sequencing. A common SNP site (dbSNP number: rs1800372) was not considered for calculation.3. Results3.1. Target sequencing method that adds barcode sequences by adaptor ligationBarcode sequences can be attached to genomic DNA and transcriptomes by adaptor ligation.11 For target or amplicon sequencing, barcode sequences are embedded in PCR primers.12 Schmitt et al.20 proposed a method to label both strands of a sequence with the same barcode sequence to detect the base changes that occur in only one strand. This method can only be used for adaptors, and it cannot be applied to barcode primers.The addition of an adaptor to a restriction enzyme site and the subsequent PCR amplification with an adaptor-primer and a single gene-specific primer constitute a robust technique that our group has extensively applied to genomic DNA21 and RNA.22,23 We have used this method for target sequencing with barcodes. Restriction enzymes with five-, four- or three-base protruding ends can be used with this method and are listed in Supplementary Table S5. The listed collection of enzymes covers most of the human genome. We used E. coli DNA ligase, which enables the sequence-specific ligation of cohesive ends generated by type IIS restriction enzymes.24 The adaptor sequence that was used includes 5 bases for indexing individuals and N12 for indexing molecules (distinguishing up to 1.7 × 107 molecules). We used two versions of the method (Fig. 1A). The first version involves linear amplification of the barcoded strand and subsequent PCR amplification. Linear amplification is expected to minimize errors in the first round of PCR. The second version employs replacement synthesis of the complementary strand to label both strands with the same barcode. For subsequent analysis, we primarily used the first version of the method with an Ion Proton sequencer. We chose the DNA-binding domain of TP53, which is covered by seven regions, as a target sequence (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1). Construction of barcoded libraries.

Monitoring and removing erroneous barcode tags in the Ion Torrent systemWe sequenced four of the seven regions using genomic DNA with masses ranging from 5 to 40 ng. An example of the relationship between the number of barcode sequence tags and the number of reads grouped by the same barcode sequence tag (reads per tag) is shown in Fig. 2A. In this experiment, the input DNA corresponded to ~10,000 copies of the genome, but the total number of tags was >400,000. The majority of these tags had a small number of reads, including single reads. However, the corresponding number of reads occupied only a small fraction of the total reads obtained (Fig. 2B). This phenomenon was observed in previous studies.11,12,25Monitoring the errors in the barcode sequence tags and absolute quantitation of target molecules. Results from Ion Proton sequencer data.

(F) Correlation between the number of molecules and the amount of input DNA after removal of the erroneous tags.Insertion/deletion errors occupy the majority (>90%) of sequencing errors in the output sequences from the Ion Torrent PGM/Proton.26,27 Consequently, the tags generated by read errors can be monitored using the tag size. The observed fractions of tags were grouped by size and are shown in Fig. 2C. Non-12-bp tags, that is erroneous tags, occupied the majority of tags with low numbers of reads per tag, and the fraction of 12-bp tags gradually increased as the number of reads per tag increased. This dynamic suggests that erroneous tags accumulate in the low read number fraction and can be removed by setting an appropriate threshold. To recover the maximum number of reads, we grouped the 11-bp and 13-bp tags that matched 12-bp tags with the exception of a single inserted or deleted base with their matching 12-bp tags. Then, we plotted the fraction of 12-bp tags against the number of reads (Fig. 2D). The minimum bin, where the average of the proportion of 12-bp tags in the nearest 11 bins was >90%, was defined as the threshold for removing erroneous tags. The fraction of 12-bp tags obtained exceeded 95% of the recovered fraction, and little improvement was observed when using more stringent thresholds. This threshold successfully separated the two peaks observed in Supplementary Figure S2A. The chosen thresholds varied depending on factors such as the total number of reads and the targeted regions: from 11 to 249 (data points of Fig. 2E) and from 57 to 485 (Fig. 2F). Through this process, 10–20% of the total reads were discarded (Supplementary Figure S2B).We could not estimate the number of removed error-free tags by counting 12-bp tags, because the 12-bp tags in the fraction with a small number of reads contained sequences of the original size due to multiple insertion/deletion errors. Because the right peak (Fig. 2A) represented the peak of the distribution of the error-free tags, we removed the fraction corresponding to the tail of the distribution. When M is defined as the threshold value, the number of error-free tags between 0 and M should not exceed the number of tags between M and 2*M. From the number of 12-bp tags between M and 2*M, the estimated maximum for the removed error-free tags was 5–10% of the total error-free tags.The number of targeted molecules can be measured using exhaustive sequencing. The number of tags obtained reached saturation at 500,000 reads (Fig. 2E). A linear relationship between the estimated number of target molecules and the amount of input DNA was observed, and the correlation coefficient was calculated to be >0.98 (Fig. 2F). Approximately 40% of the input DNA was recovered, except for TK103D, which exhibited 15% recovery. This calculation was based on the number of sequenced molecules. The difference in ligation efficiency among ligation sites is a likely cause of recovery variation.There was a good linearity between the mutant-to-normal allele ratios of the artificial DNA mixtures and those deduced using the above procedure (Supplementary Figure S3).Previous studies employed arbitrary criteria for removing tags with a small number of reads, such as the removal of tags with a single read. After applying a criterion to remove 1- or 2-read tags, a considerable fraction of erroneous tags remained, and the number of tags exceeded the number of target molecules estimated from the amount of input DNA. The number of tags increased with the addition of reads and did not reach saturation (Supplementary Figure S4), suggesting the generation of new erroneous tags.3.3. Monitoring and removing erroneous barcode tags in the Illumina systemThe read error profile of Illumina sequencers is different from that of Ion Torrent PGM/Proton sequencers. When using Illumina systems, substitution errors dominate.26,27 However, the observed distribution pattern of barcode tags was the same with both sequencing systems (Supplementary Figure S5A). To accommodate Illumina sequencers, we used ‘BDHVBDHVBDHVBDH’ as an error-detecting barcode. Here, each base position lacks one of the four bases, and the appearance of that missing base indicates a read error. We can estimate the total number of erroneous tags by multiplying the number of tags with missing bases by three (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Figure S5C). We then determined the threshold for removing erroneous tags from the distribution of error-free tags, as described above. The results obtained with Illumina sequencers were similar to those obtained using Ion Proton sequencers: 10% of the reads were removed (Supplementary Figure S5B); the values of the threshold varied from 15 to 65 (data points of Fig. 3B); the number of tags was saturated with exhaustive sequencing (Supplementary Figure S5D), but it increased continuously with the use of an arbitrary threshold (Supplementary Figure S5E); and linearity was observed between the estimated number of target molecules and the amount of input DNA (Fig. 3B).

Increased accuracy from building a consensus of reads from individual moleculesThe use of barcode tags enables high-fidelity sequencing by grouping and constructing a consensus of multiple sequences generated from a single molecule. The accuracy of this method is shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figure S6. The error rates using barcode tags overlapped with a 95% confidence interval due to the small number of non-reference bases. Although we compared the results of using DNA polymerases with different proofreading functions (Q5 DNA polymerase from NEB and Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity from Life Technologies) for the PCR amplification step of library construction, there was no significant difference when using barcode tags (Fig. 4). The second version of the barcoding method, which involved labelling both strands with the same barcode sequence, did not improve the accuracy compared with that of the single strand labelling (Fig. 4). For the first version, we used linear amplification cycles prior to PCR, which minimized the errors obtained in the early PCR cycles. This may explain why the second version of the barcoding method did not offer advantages over the single strand labelling method. Sequencing error rates for the target regions.

Analysis of plasma cfDNA from a gastric cancer patientWe tested the NOIR sequencing system by monitoring the disease progression of a gastric cancer patient (73-yr-old male). The clinical characteristics of this patient were as follows: distal gastrectomy for a 65-mm tumour with multiple lymph node metastases; positive intraoperative peritoneal cytology; emergence of multiple liver metastases in spite of post-operative S-1 chemotherapy. This patient's primary tumour carried a mutation in TP53 (c.747G > C), and we used TK103U (Fig. 1) to measure the level of the mutation at five different time points during the progression of the disease (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Table S6). The ctDNA level represented by the TP53 mutation was zero or low during the early period of the disease and increased during the later period when the disease had progressed. In contrast, the level of cfDNA had no significant changes. Except for the above mutation, there were no base changes in any of the consensus reads. Dynamics of ctDNA during the disease progression of a gastric cancer patient revealed using the NOIR sequencing system. (A) The levels of the TP53 mutant fraction in the cell-free DNA, that is ctDNA (%), and the number of total and mutation-positive molecules at various time points after the patient was operated on are displayed.

With the criterion of variant detection proposed by Couraud et al.,28 >20 positions were erroneously identified as variants.3.6. Mutation screening in lung cancerWe performed a model screening experiment using cfDNA from lung cancer patients. The samples were originally collected for a clinical study of EGFR mutations, for which the statuses of the biopsy samples were available. We used KRAS (a 73-bp region) and CTNNB1 (a 63-bp region) for the target genes. KRAS has a hotspot region in codons 12 and 13. In lung cancer, the KRAS and EGFR mutations are exclusive and rarely co-exist in the same patients. Unlike KRAS and EGFR, CTNNB1 mutations are infrequent in lung cancer.29KRAS hot spot mutations should appear only in EGFR mutation-negative lung cancer, and no mutations should be found in samples from normal individuals.The number of samples was 11 of EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer, 19 of EGFR mutation-negative lung cancer, 11 of leucocyte DNA from normal individuals and 7 of cfDNA from normal individuals. There was no significant loss of template molecules with these two genes during the assay process. The results are shown in Fig. 6A and B, and the corresponding data are provided in Supplementary Tables S7 and S8. Among the nine variant-positive cases in the KRAS experiment, eight were EGFR mutation-negative lung cancers that had substitutions in codon 12, and one was an EGFR mutation-positive case in which the substitutions were non-synonymous and located outside of the hotspot region. All cases with base changes in the hotspot region (codon 12) were judged as variant-positive. Among the three variant-positive cases in the CTNNB1 experiment, two cases were EGFR mutation-negative, and the base changes were a non-synonymous mutation and a synonymous mutation. One variant-positive case showed normal leucocyte DNA; this is the sole false-positive case. Because redundancy in sequenced molecules was removed, we can discriminate experimental errors and true mutations from distribution patterns of base changes. Base changes in this case were regarded as experimental errors, because all eight base changes were located at different base positions. In contrast, base changes in all other variant-positive cases were accumulated at a single base position. The results agreed well with previous knowledge of the mutations. Because KRAS mutations have been found in 25% of lung cancers,30 the above results suggest that most of the KRAS mutation-positive lung cancers were likely to be detected using plasma cfDNA.

The P-value of five and seven normal samples in the KRAS and CTNNB1 experiments was less than the threshold, and judged as variant-positive. For deep sequencing, less stringent threshold was required to eliminate these false positives.4. DiscussionBy using the NOIR sequencing system, we successfully eliminated false positives and could detect de novo and quantitate the mutations in plasma cfDNA. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to further evaluate the system in prospective clinical studies.The current system is designed for KRAS and the hotspot region of TP53, which cover up to 50% of the cancer population, but the system can easily be extended to include other genes, such as PI3KCA, PTEN and EGFR. Our standard assay protocol uses plasma cfDNA from 1 ml of whole blood for a single reaction,16 and this system can process 2–4 DNA fragments that are ~100 bp long in a single reaction. Thus, standard blood sampling (5–10 ml) can cover a genomic region of 1–4 kb. Application of multiplex nested PCR may increase the number of target genes beyond this limitation. Moreover, the principle may be applied to exome sequencing. It is important to note that the NOIR sequencing system still introduces sequencing errors. As the size of the target regions increases, the false positives will increase. Accurate evaluation of the probability of false positives is important.In the NOIR sequencing system, the barcode technology plays the most important role. The principle for our absolute quantitation can be applied to other systems such as RNA-seq. Deakin et al.31 examined read errors within libraries of small numbers of barcode sequences. Their analysis revealed that the erroneous barcode tags localized in the fraction containing tags with small numbers of reads, and few of these tags were found in the fraction with large numbers of reads. Although the complexity of the barcode sequences was low, the results agreed well with those obtained in our study. Additionally, two or three barcode tags out of 100 were reported to be lost during PCR. The loss was likely sufficiently small to not introduce a bias that would affect the practical application of the barcode technology.A possible alternative to the NOIR sequencing system is Safe-SeqS,12 which uses a barcode (unique identifier) for rare mutation detection. Its error rate is similar to ours, but a direct comparison may not be valid due to the different sequencing platforms and experimental conditions. The current version of Safe-SeqS uses two or four PCR cycles for barcode addition and does not satisfy the basic principle of labelling each molecule with a single unique barcode. Safe-SeqS does not measure the errors that are introduced into barcode sequences either. Thus, absolute quantitation is not possible, and the final consensus reads are redundant. This redundancy would reduce the statistical power of the mutation detection.Other deep sequencing approaches had higher error rates. Background frequencies of non-reference reads in Tam-Seq were ~0.1%,32 because using Q30 reads. Narayan et al.33 employed overlapping paired-end reads to reduce miscalls. They could reduce the miscall frequency to 0.014%, which was still significantly higher than those obtained with the barcode technologies.ctDNA has two unique features that clinical parameters do not have. One is that ctDNA carries genetic information from malignant tumours, and this information can be obtained through peripheral blood sampling. Another feature is that ctDNA is released from dying cancer cells, and its level reflects tumour burden and/or effects of anti-cancer drugs. Absolute quantitation of ctDNA would provide accurate information on the ctDNA dynamics to guide patient treatment.5.

IntroductionThe beans of Theobroma cacao, prized worldwide for their cocoa solids and cocoa butter that serve as the defining ingredient of chocolate, are now commercially produced in over 50 countries,1 including tropical regions of Central and South America, Asia and Africa. Although the species was initially domesticated from wild ancestors in Central America and Mexico,2–4 modern efforts to improve cacao were initiated in the early 1900s,5 with the classification of cacao germplasm into three major morphological/geographic groups: Criollo, Forastero and Trinitario. Only since the advent of molecular marker technology, however, has modern molecular breeding become possible for cacao. Using the precision afforded by such molecular markers, Motamayor et al.6 more accurately classified cacao germplasm into 10 major genetic clusters: Marañon, Curaray, Criollo, Iquitos, Nanay, Contamana, Amelonado, Purús, Nacional and Guiana. The tremendous genetic diversity extant within the cacao species represents a key resource for the improvement of flavour, yield and disease resistance. Moreover, breeders can exploit the heterosis that occurs in crosses between trees of different genetic groups to improve production.7Crop improvement programs rely on the accurate characterization of genetic resources (germplasm) for breeding and propagation. Historically, germplasm collections were curated based on morphology and the agronomic characteristics of individual clones.8,9 More recently, however, efforts have been underway to assess, describe and characterize cacao collections based on population structure, genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships using molecular markers.6,10–12 In addition to assisting in the curation of existing cacao germplasm collections, a key goal of an integrated cacao genetics program is to use molecular markers to select for improved varieties and maintain these in breeding programs.11,13–19Although simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have served as genetic markers in most cacao studies to date,6,11,20,21 SSR data can exhibit platform-to-platform variation, which complicates the sharing of genotype data among different research groups.22 The recent sequencing of two cacao genomes (Criollo B97-61/B223 and Matina 1-624) has substantially increased the number of resources available to cacao researchers for the identification of novel molecular markers. The most abundant marker type is the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The use of SNPs has revolutionized genetic research in many species, including cacao.25–28 SNPs are detected by aligning and comparing sequence data from genetically diverse individuals.29–31 In cacao, ~1,300 SNPs have been discovered and used for comparative genomic studies, production of consensus genetic maps, marker-assisted breeding and for curation of germplasm collections.22,32–36The ease of use and abundance of SNPs make them particularly well suited for generating saturated linkage maps. SNP-based linkage maps have been built for a variety of tree crops, including cacao.22,24,35,37 In the present study, we describe the discovery of hundreds of thousands of SNPs using next-generation sequencing, laying the foundation for future genetic mapping studies. We present results from the design and use of a 6k Illumina Infinium SNP array and demonstrate that the array is useful for the generation of a saturated genetic linkage map and the differentiation of two closely related cacao accessions.2. Methods2.1. Plant materialThe 16 cacao accessions making up the diversity panel used here for SNP discovery (Fig. 1) represent the 10 distinct genetic clusters of cacao identified by Motamayor et al.6 All plant tissues were collected at the USDA-ARS SHRS germplasm collection in Miami except EBC-148, which was from the Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza (CATIE), Turrialba, Costa Rica. Mature pistil tissue from unpollinated flowers of UF273 Type I was also collected at CATIE. Tissue samples from CATIE were placed into RNAlater (Life Technologies, NY, USA) for stable shipment prior to RNA extraction. RNA samples were used for transcript sequencing and SNP calling. SNP discovery and filtering for the selection of 6,000 SNPs for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array. Variants identified by alignment to an early Matina reference transcriptome. Standard filtering was applied to provide confidence in the existence of the variants. SNP Filter was applied to retain only biallelic SNP variants, referred to as the Original SNP Report. As a measure of added confidence, only those SNPs for which at least two accessions displayed the variant allele and two accessions displayed the reference allele were kept (Selected Filtered SNPs). Additional loci filtering was applied to reduce the number of selected SNPs down to the targeted final filtered SNPs, which were included on the Cacao6kSNP array.SNP discovery and filtering for the selection of 6,000 SNPs for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array.

Additional loci filtering was applied to reduce the number of selected SNPs down to the targeted final filtered SNPs, which were included on the Cacao6kSNP array.A total of 1,152 cacao DNA samples were collected and submitted to Illumina for genotyping. These samples consisted of trees from the USDA cacao collection in Miami, including 9 of the 16 accessions from the diversity panel described above. Also included were five separate F1 mapping populations: Pound 7 × UF273 Type I (181 trees, CATIE Type 1), Pound 7 × UF273 Type II (68 trees, CATIE Type 2), KA2-101 × K82 and reciprocal (340 trees, PNG) and TSH1188 × CCN51 (498 trees, MCCS). The remaining 56 samples represent duplicated controls (36 samples) and select germplasm lines (20 samples). Leaves from the CATIE Type 1 and Type 2 populations were collected in CATIE, samples from PNG 1 and PNG 8 came from the Cacao and Coconut Institute in Papua New Guinea and the MCCS population came from the Mars Center for Cacao Science in Brazil.2.2. RNA extraction for SNP discoveryFollowing a modified form of the method described by Chang et al.,38 RNA was extracted from leaf tissue for all cacao accessions in the diversity panel, with the exception of UF273 Type I, for which pistil tissue was used. A total of 1 g of leaf tissue (excluding the mid-rib) was collected from each tree and placed immediately in liquid nitrogen, then ground to a fine powder and homogenized in 15 ml of 65°C extraction buffer39 using a PRO200 Homogenizer with a 10 × 115 mm generator (PRO Scientific, Inc., CT, USA). Pistil tissue was first dissected from mature, unopened flowers in RNAlater with a scalpel and dissecting microscope. Approximately 20 dissected pistils were ground in liquid nitrogen, homogenized and then treated identically as leaf samples. All samples were extracted twice with equal volumes chloroform (1 min homogenization with the PRO200 Homogenizer and 30 min centrifugation at 10,500 × g). One-third volume of 8 M LiCl was then added, the sample mixed and the RNA precipitated overnight or over the weekend at 0°C (in an ice water bath in a 4°C refrigerator). The RNA pellet was obtained via centrifugation at 10,500 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was then processed with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The clean RNA was treated with DNase by adding 100 µl water, 20 µl DNase buffer and 4 µl DNase I (Roche, IN, USA) and incubating for 30 min. RNA was extracted with 180 µl phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol (25 : 24 : 1) with centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Next, 20 µl 3M NaOAc and 600 µl 100% ethanol were added to the supernatant and left to precipitate overnight at -80°C. The pellet was obtained via centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and then rinsed with 500 µl 80% EtOH. The dried pellet was resuspended in 50 µl RNase-free water.2.3. DNA extraction for genotypingPurification of genomic DNA from T. cacao is difficult and not standardized for use in automated DNA extraction pipelines because of the high concentrations of carbohydrates, polyphenolic compounds and other secondary metabolites that oxidize nucleic acids. Here, ~300 mg of tissue was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen and immediately put in 1 ml of an inert wash buffer containing final concentrations of 100 mM Hepes, 0.1% PVP 40 (w/v) and 4% 2-mercapto-ethanol in 1.2 ml centrifuge tubes. The tubes were vortexed on a medium setting for 5 min and centrifuged at 8,400 × g for 5 min, decanted and washed 4–6 more times until the supernatant was no longer viscous. After the final wash, the pellet was suspended in nuclei extraction buffer (15% sucrose, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 50 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 500 mM NaCl) by vortexing. The solution was incubated at 50°C for 15 min, mixing gently every 2 min and then centrifuged at 8,400 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pelleted plant material resuspended in 450 µl of 20 mM Tris–HCl with 10 mM EDTA. Next, 80 µl of 10% SDS was added, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 70°C. Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and then mixed with 300 µl of 7.5 M NH4OAc (stored at -20°C) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at top speed for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous layer was transferred to a clean 1.2-ml tube, combined with an equal amount of isopropanol, and centrifuged at top speed for 15 min at 4°C. The DNA pellet was washed two times with ice-cold 70% ETOH and resuspended in 100 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl.2.4. Creation of the transcriptome reference sequenceTotal leaf RNA of Matina 1-6 (800 ng) was used for a library preparation optimized for Roche/454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing described previously (NCBI SRX17296524,40). High-quality sequence reads (1,510,557) were trimmed and assembled using Newbler v2.0 into 29,787 contigs of average length 725 (SD = 558).242.5. SNP discovery in the diversity panelThe Matina 1-6 leaf transcriptome assembly was used as a reference sequence for SNP discovery among the members of a diversity panel that contains 16 accessions. mRNA isolated from each accession was used in double-stranded Illumina libraries after two rounds of oligo dT selection from total RNA. Three hundred base-pair library fragments were agarose gel purified, amplified by PCR and quality assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina GAII to 54 nt length using protocols of the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequence reads are deposited in the short read archive (SRA) of NCBI under BioProject PRJNA51633 (Accession no. SRX278177 and SRX278006).Sequence variants were identified by aligning the Illumina reads to the Matina 1-6 leaf transcriptome using the Alpheus analysis pipeline detailed by Miller et al.41 In brief, paired-end reads were aligned to the reference using the GSNAP aligner configured to allow up to 5% mismatch across the paired read considered as a whole. The data were filtered to reduce false positives. Only variants within reads that aligned uniquely to the reference were considered. Unique mapping ranged among accessions of the diversity panel from ~20 to 45% of total reads (Supplementary Figure S1). Sequence read data quality and depth standards (Fig. 1, standard filter) required the variant to be present in at least two reads covering the base position, present in at least 20% of the total number of reads covering the variant, and to possess a sequence quality score of Q20 or higher. A variant report was generated from the Alpheus output, with SNPs named with respect to individual Matina 1-6 transcriptome contigs.2.6. Selection of sequences for genotyping arrayAdditional filtering was applied to the variants in a stepwise manner to optimize selection and further reduce markers to the number appropriate for the array. Only bi-allelic SNPs were retained after sequence quality and depth filtering: all insertion/deletions (indels) and multi-allelic polymorphisms were excluded. The Original SNP Report contained ~340 K sequences after these exclusions (Fig. 1). The next major filtering step considered data of the diversity panel as a whole. Here, SNPs were retained only if the reference (Matina 1-6) allele appeared in two accessions and the alternative allele also appeared in two accessions. This filtering step provided selection confidence against potential artifacts of single RNA samples and resulted in the list of 48,408 termed Selected Filtered SNPs (Fig. 1). Each potential marker was evaluated on the basis of its internal sequence with each sequence subjected to review of their expected performance in the Illumina Infinium technology. First, all markers in the Selected Filtered SNP set were submitted to Illumina and assigned an Assay Design Tool score. This score predicts the success of an SNP assay on the array by taking into account the GC content and sequence adjacent to the SNP site and assigning a value from zero to one. Only SNPs with an Illumina Infinium Assay Design Tool score >0.9 were included in the Final Filtered SNPs.Furthermore, minor allele frequency (MAF) was calculated for each locus. Markers with a MAF >0.2 were selected for the Final Filtered set. Sequences surrounding the SNPs were screened for the presence of intron–exon junctions using BLASTn on a preliminary Matina 1-6 genome assembly24 and any containing a putative junction site was removed. Because the array was to be used on multiple mapping populations, SNPs heterozygous in at least one, but not all, diversity panel accessions were selected for inclusion on the array. As the Infinium array uses a primer extension bead-based array for genotyping, the number of markers that can be included depends on the bead type of each marker, which in turn is dependent on the nucleotides being assayed. Markers that distinguish A/T or C/G alleles require two beads. To increase the number of loci represented, only single bead-type SNPs (A/C, A/G, T/C, T/G) were chosen for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array. Finally, when possible, two SNPs per transcript were selected in an effort to ensure locus representation should one marker fail.2.7. SNP evaluation and linkage mappingData generated from all 1,152 samples were analysed with GenomeStudio (Illumina), and genotypes were called using a GenCall threshold of 0.15. Additionally, to serve as a quality control for genotype calling, only markers with GenTrain and GenCall 10% scores above 0.4 and 0.2, respectively, were included for data analysis. The data were exported and separated into populations, with germplasm and diversity panel accessions (grouped per genetic affinity) comprising their own ‘populations'. For genetic mapping, the markers present in each dataset were reduced so that only SNPs showing segregation in one or both of the parental lines remained.Pair-wise Identity by descent (IBD) values were estimated with PLINK v1.0742 with 5,149 SNPs for two mapping populations: CATIE Type 1 (Pound 7 × UF273 Type I) and CATIE Type 2 (Pound 7 × UF273 Type II), with 180 and 69 progenies, respectively. The total number of pair-wise calculations including the three parents (Pound 7, UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II) is 31,626. A pedigree file was used to allow PLINK to relate the two populations correctly. Assignments of ‘parent-offspring’, ‘full-sibling’, ‘half-sibs’ (i.e. CATIE Type 1 versus CATIE Type 2 progenies) and ‘other-related’ (i.e. mother/father) were assigned. The IBD distribution was plotted with R.43A conservative estimation of the number of SNP loci needed to differentiate related cacao accessions (i.e. determine off-types) was performed. The genotyping error rate was calculated from five replicated DNA samples of Pound 7, UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II included on the Cacao6kSNP array. The genotyping error rate was small for all three parents, with UF273 Type II samples exhibiting the highest number of non-concordant genotypes with 14 out of 5,149 (0.00272). To be conservative, we rounded the calculated genotyping error rate of 0.00272 to 0.01 mistypes per locus, and the probability of differentiating any two cacao accessions was determined from the binomial distribution. As direct siblings are likely to share many alleles, the probability of detecting an off-type between any two pair of individuals was defined as the probability of observing more genotype differences between them than expected with a genotyping error rate of 0.01. We calculated this probability for different numbers of SNPs sampled and for three different levels of relatedness (i.e. expected number of genotype differences). The proportion of differing loci between the closely related accessions UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II (0.162) was used as a reference point likely to be encountered in practical situations. Additionally, proportion values, or levels of relatedness, of 0.1 and 0.3 were also included to indicate the number of SNP loci that might be needed to differentiate more or less related accessions.A genetic linkage map was constructed using the CATIE Type 2 mapping population. This population resulted from the cross of Pound 7 × UF273 Type II and consists of 68 individual trees. The initial mapping dataset included 2,857 SNPs that demonstrated segregation in the population. To generate the linkage map, the JoinMap 4.1 software (Kyazma, the Netherlands) was used by first converting the raw genotype data into the JoinMap format using the parental genotypes to define the segregation type and then assigning the appropriate allele code based upon the genotype data.44 Markers with a significant amount of segregation distortion (15 SNPs) and with >10% missing data (11 SNPs) were removed from the linkage mapping analysis. Marker grouping was selected with a recombination frequency of 0.1 or higher, resulting in the formation of 10 linkage groups (one for each chromosome of cacao). Mapping itself was performed using maximum likelihood analysis. The fit and stress values, a measure of linkage strength, of the markers on each linkage group were examined, and any markers with a value >7 were removed. The linkage mapping was re-iterated until all markers had values <7. The small size of the CATIE Type 2 population contributed to a large number of markers with high fit and stress values. In total, 242 SNPs were removed due to fit and stress values above the stated threshold, resulting in a final linkage map consisting of 68 individuals with 2,589 SNPs.3. Results and discussion3.1. Filtering and SNP statisticsAmong the transcriptome reference sequences built for Matina 1-6 genome annotation efforts,24 a Matina 1-6 leaf transcriptome assembly was used for the SNP discovery described here. This transcriptome represented ~22 Mb of sequence in 29,787 isotigs.40 Paired-end Illumina GAII reads for 16 highly diverse cacao accessions were obtained and mapped as described (SRA BioProject PRJNA51633). Supplementary Fig. S1 summarizes the read coverage against the transcriptome assembly for each accession used for SNP calling. Unique mapped reads (red) were used to call SNPs. The repetitive (green) reads had at least one end of the read-pair map to multiple places within the transcriptome, whereas the unmapped (blue) reads failed to map under the described thresholds (Supplementary Fig. S1). For each accession, the average number of reads per final filtered SNP selected for the Cacao6kSNP array ranged from 13 to 67 reads per SNP (Supplementary Fig. S1).The original SNP report identified 339,330 SNPs, which were reduced to 48,408 selected filtered SNPs, and finally to 6,000 SNPs selected for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array (Fig. 1). Figure 2 plots the location along the cacao genome of the selected filtered (middle ring) and the final filtered (inner ring) SNPs. Originally designed to be broadly applicable to various germplasm collections and mapping populations, our filtering methods favoured high-quality SNPs with large minor allele frequencies across the set, rather than SNPs specific to any one genotype. Although rare SNPs may identify a specific genetic background or unusual phenotype in germplasm collections, they are likely to be homozygous and hence unmappable in mapping populations. When possible, redundancy of marker usefulness among genotypes was preferred. The inclusion of two SNPs per contig that met all the filtering criteria was a measure of precaution against failed genotyping at any one locus. This precaution was unnecessary as 5,149 of the 5,388 successfully synthesized beads (96%) yielded reliable genotype data. Location of SNP sets along the Matina 1-6 genome.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research onlineIn the final filtered set, 4,632 contigs were represented on the Cacao6kSNP array by 6,000 loci. This represents an average of 1.3 SNPs/contig. Because an early transcriptome assembly was used to identify SNPs, many of these contigs were later collapsed into one another during the gene model prediction and annotation stage of genome assembly.24 The final number of gene models represented by the selected SNPs was determined and shows a slight reduction to 4,305 gene models (1.4 SNPs/gene model on average). The gene models represented on the Cacao6kSNP array display a cross-section of cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes as determined via GOslim annotation (Fig. 3). This diversity in the types of genes represented suggests that the SNPs selected for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array are likely to have broad impacts on plant physiology, making them desirable for general marker-trait association analysis. Large proportions of genes involved in protein (13%) and nucleotide (10%) binding are represented, along with those with transferase (9%) and hydrolase (8%) activities. The largest biological processes represented include metabolic, cellular and protein metabolism. Of immediate interest to cacao breeding efforts are the SNPs present in gene models involved in stress and abiotic or biotic response (4%) and those linked to developmental processes (2%).

SNP array evaluationOf the 6,000 SNPs submitted for inclusion on the bead array, 5,388 were successfully synthesized. Failing to produce genotype data for any sample, 171 SNPs were removed before analysis. Removing markers with low GenTrain (<0.4) and GenCall 10% (<0.2) scores resulted in a final set of 5,149 SNPs. The Cacao6kSNP array was originally run with 1,152 DNA samples (including duplicated controls), but seven DNA samples failed completely. In total, 5,149 SNPs were genotyped in 1,145 DNA samples for a total of 5,895,605 data points. Only 6,171 of these data points provided no definitive genotype representing 0.1% missing data within the total analysed dataset. The submitted Cacao6kSNP represented 6,912,000 potential data, of which 85% provided useful genotype data.3.3. Comparison of allele calls from chip array and sequencingA cursory survey was performed to compare the initial sequencing-based SNP calls from RNAseq with the genotype data generated from the Cacao6kSNP array. Nine accessions present in both datasets were examined for differences in allele calls (Table 1). Concordance between genotypes can be found along the diagonal for each accession and ranged from 86 to 99% across the nine accessions compared (Table 1). Overall, 39,399 data points were compared and found to be 93% concordant (36,724 data points). The majority of non-concordance events observed for any particular accession appear to represent differences in the sensitivity of heterozygous allele detection, that is, when one dataset called a marker heterozygous and the other set called the same marker homozygous. Homozygous changes, or those for which the sequencing reads called one homozygous allele and the array called homozygous for the other allele, were much less common. In total, 1,916 SNPs generated differing genotype calls between the Cacao6kSNP array and RNAseq data. This number was striking and represents variation for 37% of the total SNPs genotyped. A closer examination of the differences was performed. The number of non-concordant markers was calculated and sorted based on the number of accessions showing discrepancies for that particular SNP (Table 2). This analysis revealed that the bulk (1,433) of the identified non-concordant SNPs differed within a single accession and that 97% (1,383) of the differences observed were heterozygous changes. Visual inspection of these SNPs in GenomeStudio displayed three well-defined clusters for the majority of the markers. Additionally, for discrepant SNPs in the parents of the CATIE mapping population, Pound 7 and UF273, Mendelian segregation was used to infer the correct genotype of the parent. For all instances when either parent was the only accession displaying discrepancies between the Cacao6kSNP array and RNAseq, segregation of the CATIE mapping populations supported the genotype value obtained by the Cacao6kSNP array. In contrast, non-congruent SNPs with three or more accessions showing differences display a larger proportion of opposing homozygotes (24–100%), and the number of discrepant markers dropped to only 136 SNPs for this whole subset (Table 2). When SNPs with three or more non-concordant accessions were examined in GenomeStudio, over half showed poor or single cluster formation, indicating issues with the Cacao6kSNP data for these SNPs. Those displaying three well-defined clusters had less than six sequencing reads for the discrepant accessions. Although experiments specifically designed to assess the accuracy of the chip array versus short read sequencing calls are still required, from our data, it appears as though the majority of non-concordant markers are the result of improper allele calls from the use of sequencing reads, based on the strong cluster formation, segregation data and small number of discrepant accessions affected by these SNPs. These issues are possibly the result of low read coverage or strand (allele) bias at the mismatched SNP causing heterozygotes to be misidentified as homozygotes. However, the less common SNPs with the opposing homozygous alleles are more likely issues with the chip array, as evidenced by the increase in poor cluster formation for these SNPs.

Complete SNP dataset comparison among selected genotypesTo assess the utility of the Cacao6kSNP array data in distinguishing among accessions, representative accessions of the two sequenced genomes (Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13) known to belong to divergent genetic groups6 were compared. Both accessions showed extreme homozygosity across 5,117 SNPs, with only two and six heterozygotes identified in Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13, respectively, resulting in 99.8% homozygosity. This finding is consistent with previous analyses using microsatellite markers23,24 and was helpful in the generation of the respective genome assemblies. Despite their high levels of homozygosity, these accessions share only a meager 38% of their alleles (1,936 out of 5,117). A list of the markers with differing alleles between Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13 can be found in Supplementary Table S1. This allelic divergence is perhaps due to geographic isolation and differing evolutionary paths. In terms of cacao breeding, an examination of the differences between these accessions may identify alleles specific for particular traits of interest. Criollo is often preferred by the fine flavour chocolate producers but tends to suffer from poor yields,45,46 whereas Matina, an Amelonado type, one of the most grown genetic groups, is higher yielding and makes up a large proportion of bulk chocolate. A better understanding of the genetic differences between these two clones may provide insight into the mechanism and control of the traits that make each desirable to cacao growers and producers.Two other genotypes, this time closely related: UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II, were also examined. These two accessions, respectively, serve as the fathers for the CATIE Type 1 and CATIE Type 2 populations generated at CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica.47 Originally intended to be a single F1 population from the cross of Pound 7 × UF273, five cloned trees of UF273 were used as parents. After the F1 population was planted, it was discovered that one tree out of the five UF273 trees used as a pollen donor was genetically distinct from the other four clones (UF273 Type I) and was henceforth referred to as UF273 Type II. An SSR analysis of 180 markers revealed variation in UF273 Type II alleles for 22 markers (12%), with most often one allele differing at the locus.47 A comparison of UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II was performed using 5,123 successful genotypes from the Cacao6kSNP array. UF273 Type I shows 60% homozygousity (3,101 out of 5,123 markers) and UF273 Type II only slightly more at 64% (3,276 out of 5,123). Further distinguishing themselves from the Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13 accessions, UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II share 84% identity (4,294 markers) and 99% of their alleles, having only eight opposing homozygous SNPs out of the 5,123 markers compared. The high proportion of shared alleles between these two accessions suggests a close genetic relationship. IBD values of all pair-wise comparisons for both the CATIE Type 1 and Type 2 mapping populations were determined and are summarized in Fig. 4. A pair-wise IBD value of 0.92 was determined for UF273 Type I versus UF273 Type II, indicating that it is a first-degree (full-sib) relationship (Fig. 4). There are only two cases where the IBD is as high, or higher, than those of the UF273 accessions. Two full-sibs from the CATIE Type 1 population also share an IBD of 0.92, and another comparison shows an IBD of 1 (genetically identical), which can be attributed to a field error. The UF273 Type I and Type II accessions are so similar that they have often been lumped together as few genetic differences between the two were previously observed.47 However, this pooling often creates problems for cacao breeders as progeny generated from crosses with these accessions has been shown to segregate differently for multiple traits (Dr Wilbert Phillips, personal communication). The availability of SNPs to easily distinguish these accessions from one another would serve to reassure breeding efforts utilizing one or both. A total of 827 markers differentiating UF273 Type I and Type II accessions were reported and can be found in Supplementary Table S2.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research onlineThe first-order relationship between UF273 Type I and Type II provides an opportunity to examine the number of SNP markers needed to successfully differentiate between two closely related accessions, a task that is often essential in cacao breeding programs. Using a number of randomly selected loci genotyped in the Cacao6kSNP array as a pool of markers, we determined the probability of successfully differentiating accessions with 10%, 16.2% (as observed with UF273 Type I and Type II) and 30% genetic variation (Fig. 5). A confidence threshold of 95%, taking into account the genotyping error rate, was used to identify different accessions. Serving as a measure of relatedness, the proportion of loci that were different between the first-order related UF273 accessions (0.162) was used as a reference point as differentiation between two full-sibs is likely to be a practical situation encountered in breeding programs. Proportion values of 0.1 and 0.3 were also included to show how the results might change with more or less genetically related accessions as described in the Materials and Methods. For the example of UF273 Type I and Type II, 24 loci are required to confidently distinguish one accession from another, whereas for accessions displaying only 10% variation, 30 loci would be required (Fig. 5). These values are consistent with those identified in bovine systems and in other cacao studies,28,36 which reported that ~40 SNP loci are required to differentiate genetically distinct individuals. The number of loci required to distinguish related accessions can be genotyped easily using modern SNP genotyping systems (Fluidigm, Sequenome, Golden Gate, etc.) and will be of value for marker-assisted selection breeding programs.

Linkage mappingIn preparation for genetic linkage mapping with the Cacao6kSNP data, SNPs displaying segregation within the different mapping populations were separated from the uninformative loci. Segregating SNPs, or those where one or both parents are heterozygous, can be used to generate linkage maps in these F1 populations. The number of segregating SNPs within and between mapping populations is shown as a Venn diagram (Fig. 6). The total number of segregating SNPs ranges from 2,543 to 3,563, which is ~10 times as many markers as in the composite SSR map created by Brown et al.48 and 2 to 3 times the number of markers in the composite map generated by Allegre et al.35 A number of SNPs specific to each of the mapping populations were identified (Fig. 6). Furthermore, 260 loci segregate in CATIE Type 2 but do not segregate in CATIE Type 1. Additionally, CATIE Type 1 has 346 segregating markers that do not segregate in the Type 2 population (Fig. 6). These population-specific SNPs may prove instrumental in determining associations with traits specific to one population. Conversely, the 956 SNPs held in common across all populations can be used as anchor markers in a composite linkage map. Placement of the markers of this set will provide higher overall precision than use of markers from any one individual map.35,47Supplementary Table S3 lists all SNPs present on the Cacao6kSNP array, any population they segregate within, their positions on the Matina 1-6 genome, nearby SNPs presented by Allegre et al.35 as well as transcript sequences flanking each SNP.

Overlapping rectangles indicate markers shared between those populations. Numbers within rectangles represent the number of markers that can be mapped within those population(s).A genetic linkage map of the CATIE Type 2 population (Pound 7 × UF273 Type II) was generated with 68 individuals and 2,589 SNP markers (Fig. 7), producing a map of 1,268 cM total length. Ten linkage groups corresponding to the 10 chromosomes of cacao were identified, and linkage group designation was assigned by comparing mapped markers to the chromosomes of the Matina 1-6 genome assembly using the convention defined by Lanaud.24,49 Linkage mapping generally relies on large numbers of individuals within the population to identify recombination events, which are used to order markers along the map. Although quite small for linkage map generation, this population is typical of many cacao mapping populations, which are often studied in regions where resources are limited. Combined with the large land requirements of tree breeding and the need to maintain trees for many years, cacao mapping populations seldom have more than a hundred individuals, although a few exceptions exist at larger cacao research stations. The substantial increase in the number of markers should help to identify recombination events that may not be noticed with fewer markers. The genetic map generated for the CATIE Type 2 population serves as a proof of concept that larger numbers of markers can help, but not completely overcome, a limited number of individuals. A summary of the linkage map is presented in Table 3, as is the composite linkage map generated by Allegre et al. for comparison.35Summary of CATIE type 2 linkage map generated with SNPs (top) and the composite Allegre35 linkage map generated with SNPs (bottom)Summary of CATIE type 2 linkage map generated with SNPs (top) and the composite Allegre35 linkage map generated with SNPs (bottom)Linkage map of the Pound 7 × UF273 Type II mapping population.

Markers are depicted as black lines with their position (cM) reported to the left. Linkage group designation is indicated across the top, markers are identified as horizontal lines and cM position is indicated along the left.Compared with a composite map generated with 1,240 SNPs (Table 3), the total length of all linkage groups was longer. The CATIE Type 2 map has a largest gap length between markers of 14 cM on LG05 and an average longest gap length of 7.5 cM across all linkage groups. In comparison, the Allegre composite SNP map has a 7.6 cM gap (LG02) and an average longest gap length of 4.3 cM.35 Despite the increased number of SNPs on the CATIE Type 2 map, the gap size did not decrease. The redundancy in SNP selection for the Cacao6kSNP array is the most likely reason for this observation. Although more SNPs were present, they co-located (i.e. had the same cM position) along the map. In the CATIE Type 2 linkage map (Fig. 7), ~1,600 SNPs were co-located. If these SNPs were selected from additional transcripts, fewer co-locating markers, and thus smaller gaps, would be expected. Additionally, the identification of SNPs from the transcriptome limited marker positions to the gene space. As a result, gene-rich regions may contain an abundance of markers. In the future, to better distribute SNPs across each linkage group, it will be beneficial to represent more transcripts or non-transcribed SNPs, perhaps evenly positioned across the chromosome, rather than to prioritize marker redundancy.The generation of a composite map increases the effective number of individuals within the mapping population, improving the chance of observing recombination events. The smaller size of the CATIE Type 2 population reduces the number of observed recombinations, causing markers to co-locate and generating gaps between clumps of markers. The uncertainty introduced by ordering co-located markers can also result in somewhat larger linkage groups. An estimate of base- pairs per cM was calculated for each map, first using the length of each sequenced genome separately and then averaging the resulting values together; the error presented represents the standard deviation (Table 3). An average size was used, because Matina has one of the larger cacao genome sizes, whereas Criollo has one of the smaller genome sizes.24 The CATIE Type 2 map, at 2 SNPs/cM, generated an average size of 216,420 bp/cM, whereas the Allegre composite map, with 1.7 SNPs/cM, predicted 365,656 bp/cM.Under ideal conditions, SNPs with fit and stress values (a statistical measure of whether a locus fits well between its neighbours; lower values represent a better fit) over 2 are removed from the map. To generate this map, 242 SNPs with a fit and stress value over 7 were removed; this relatively high number of markers is due to the limited number of individuals in the population, which reduces the strength of the linkages. When data from the Cacao6kSNP array is used to map a much larger population, the increased number of individuals in that population contributes to significantly improve fit and stress values for the mapped SNPs, further emphasizing that for linkage mapping, additional markers cannot completely overcome a lack of individuals. Despite this issue, the markers on the CATIE Type 2 linkage map show strong co-linearity to both the Matina 1-6 v1.1 and Criollo v1 genome assemblies (Fig. 8). Marker positions of the linkage map were compared with the genomic positions of both assembled cacao genomes. Marker sequences for the 2,589 SNPs included on the CATIE Type 2 linkage map were blasted to each assembled genome to determine marker position, and all of the linkage groups that contain a mapped marker are displayed with identical markers connected by grey lines (Fig. 8). Eleven linkage groups are presented for the Criollo v1 assembly as some markers were found on Tc00, a scaffold used to hold sequences that could not be placed on the original Criollo v1 assembly.45 As such, the increased number of markers on this new linkage map may have helped to anchor additional regions of the Criollo v1 assembly (Tc00) onto the 10 chromosomes.

Marker positions are depicted as grey lines and show marker position either by linkage mapping (CATIE Type 2) or blasting 121-mers containing the SNP to the genomic assemblies of Criollo23 or Matina.24 Tc00 contains unanchored sequences in the Criollo assembly.

This demonstrates the advantages of a more saturated genetic map in genome assembly.Comparison of SNP marker positions.

ConclusionsWe have identified nearly 400,000 SNP markers across a cross-section of the cacao transcriptome diversity and from these constructed a Cacao6kSNP array. With this ‘chocolate chip’, 5,149 markers provided genotype data for 1,152 samples, including five mapping populations. A linkage map with 2,589 SNPs was generated for the smallest of these mapping populations. The data generated from this chip have allowed the comparison of important cacao genotypes. Additionally, we determined a minimum number of SNP markers required to distinguish closely related accessions, with the aim of helping further cacao breeding efforts. Future QTL and association studies using these larger SNP datasets promise to identify markers that can be utilized in marker-assisted selection breeding programs throughout the world to help ensure a ready supply of chocolate.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis project was part of the Matina 1-6 cacao sequencing project, and was funded by MARS, Inc.

IntroductionAlterations in gene expression patterns are the regulatory basis for phenotypic plasticity: one single genome may produce quite different phenotypes, thus representing an important mechanism to adapt for alternating environmental conditions including morphological, physiological and behavioural changes.1 Similarly, differentiation processes in developmental stages of multicellular organisms allow one single genotype to differentiate into distinct tissues, representing the regulation of gene expression patterns in the meaning of phenotypic plasticity: epigenetic mechanisms have the aim to fix these gene expression patterns rather than to allow subsequent flexibility.2Among the diverse mechanisms regulating alterations in gene expression during phenotypic variation, one can distinguish mechanisms that evolved as a fast reaction to stresses, e.g. the heat-shock response, and adaptations to long-term changes in environments, e.g. such as temperature and food availability. The molecular regulation of the heat-shock proteins (HSPs) represents a tightly controlled transcriptional activation of molecular chaperones that assist proper folding of proteins.3 Usually, this transcriptional activation of HSPs occurs in minutes and only for a few minutes, thus being a rapid, programmed and reversible response to stress.Although it is clear that short-time stress response and long-term phenotypic plasticity are key players for survival during short-time and long-term environmental changes, a general understanding of the complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms controlling phenotypic plasticity as a response to environmental changes is still missing.4 Only few studies addressed the extent of phenotypic plasticity based on genome-wide transcriptomic profiling in response to altered environments.Adaptation to different environmental temperatures represents one of the most important stress responses of organisms. As ectothermic species may use any environmental heat source to regulate their body temperature thus optimizing their metabolism, some organisms are poikilothermic, meaning that their body temperature is equal to the ambient environmental temperature which challenges the cellular metabolism to work properly in a huge range of temperatures. Depending on the level of temperature variation, adaptation processes have to control survival critical functions like efficient metabolic turnover. In the past, much attention was spend on the composition of membrane lipids during cold adaptation and heat-shocks,5 but only few studies investigated transcriptomic changes to identify general metabolic pathways altered during temperature adaptation processes.Paramecia are unicellular model organisms belonging to the ciliate clade. These are distributed all over the world in all climate areas. However, a single population may have to cope with drastic temperature alterations: on the one hand, these cells are so small that they cannot prevent poikilothermy by increasing body mass/volume ratio, and on the other hand, their natural ecosystem of small ponds undergoes drastic short-time temperature alterations. It is not surprising that paramecia in laboratory cultures can easily be cultivated at a broad temperature range from 4°C to 32°C. Therefore, Paramecium represents an excellent model to investigate mechanisms of temperature adaptation, and this ciliate has been subject of several studies investigating heat-shock response of individual genes,6–8 but a genome-wide analysis is still missing.This unicellular model organism has become even more attractive for the characterization of phenotypic plasticity as several epigenetic mechanisms have been described that allow differentiation of lineages into different cell states, which are reminiscent of developmental differentiation processes in multicellular organisms. One prominent example concerns the expression of the mating-type system,9 and similarly, but not by the same mechanisms, the antigenic system was described to be epigenetically controlled a long time ago.10 Recent studies indicate that the antigenic system is regulated by complex mechanisms involving small RNAs and dynamic chromatin alterations11,12 (see Cheaib et al., in preparation): Paramecium displays mutually exclusive expression of variable surface antigen genes similar to the phenomenon of antigenic variation in pathogens.13 Serotypes, meaning exclusive expression of one antigen gene of the surface antigen gene (SAg) multigene family, are initially triggered by different environmental conditions, e.g. temperature and food availability.14 They are stabilized by mechanisms similar to epigenetic differentiation processes, which are under control of an RNAi mechanism likely involved in transcriptional silencing.11 It was shown that a telomere position effect (TPE) is required for SAg regulation, suggesting that spreading of telomeric heterochromatin is involved in RNAi-mediated silencing.12 Differentiation into distinct serotypes therefore represents an epigenetically controlled manifestation of gene expression patterns, which interestingly can also be passed on to sexual progeny. In contrast to mating-type determination, serotype switches can occur anytime without the need for sexual recombination. Hence, they represent an important example of epigenetically controlled and heritable transcriptomic variations of a single genotype.13To understand the processes of long-term and shocked temperature adaptations in the context of serotype expression, we analysed the transcriptome information of serotype pure cultures to see to which extent the transcriptome becomes altered during temperature adaptation and how this is related to the epigenetically controlled SAg multigene family. We furthermore analysed the subtelomeres of SAg containing chromosomes to characterize a possible heterochromatic spreading from telomeric repeats by transcriptomic analysis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Paramecium culture conditions, serotype analysis and heat-shocksParamecium tetraurelia strain 51 and d4-2 were grown in wheat grass powder (WGP, Pines International Co., Lawrence, KS, USA) infusion medium bacterized with Klebsiella pneumoniae supplemented with 0.8 µg/ml ß-sitosterol, unless otherwise stated (serotype 51A, 51H of strain 51) and 1 : 1 diluted with Volvic® mineral water (serotype 51D, 51B of strain d4-2). To stabilize/trigger respective serotypes, different cultivation temperatures were chosen: 51A at 31°C, 51B at 24°C/6°C, 51D at 24°C and 51H at 14°C. Serotype expression was verified by immobilization with specific antibodies (1 : 100) (rabbit a-51A/-51B/-51D/-51H) in depression slides. Only serotype-pure cultures (refers to 100% immobilization) were used for further analysis. For heat-shock experiments, serotype-51D cultures were harvested, washed in Volvic® mineral water and exposed to 39°C for 20 min.8 51B cells were selected out of a 51D culture by immobilization with a-51D serum (1 : 100). Individual survived cells were transferred to fresh WGP-medium bacterized with K. pneumoniae after washing in Volvic® mineral water. One hundred per cent serotype 51B expressing cultures were cultivated at 24°C. They were then split, and the counterpart was cultivated at 14°C for 1 day before transfer to 6°C.2.2. RNA isolation, cDNA library creation, Illumina sequencingA total of 150,000 P. tetraurelia cells per sample were harvested, washed in Volvic® mineral water and incubated for 20 min at the respective temperature in non-nutrient medium to reduce bacterial occurrence in food vacuoles. Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent® (Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany). After DNAse I (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) digestion and subsequent purification with acid phenol, RNA integrity was verified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Poly-A enrichment (NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module) out of 1 µg total RNA and library preparation (NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina) were carried out according to manufacturer's recommendation using 11 PCR cycles of library enrichment. Multiplexed libraries were 100 nt paired-end sequenced with an average of 14 Mio reads per sample on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Reads were demultiplexed with bcl2fastq (v1.8.4) and trimmed for adaptor contamination and low-quality bases with the cutadapt (v1.4.1)15 wrapper trim_galore (v0.3.3). All raw data were deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) under study accession no. PRJEB9464.2.3. Annotation of HSP70 isoforms and phylogenetic reconstructionHSP70 candidates were identified by a proteome-wide search against the Pfam library of hidden Markov models.16 Hits were extracted for PF00012 (HSP70) using an E-value threshold of 3.6E-23. Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW, and neighbour-joining trees were calculated with MEGA617 with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, based on the Poisson model and after complete deletion of gaps.2.4. RNA-seq expression analysisWe quantified gene expression levels using the Sailfish algorithm.18 Briefly, Sailfish uses transcript sequences to build a kmer index over all annotated transcript sequences. RNA-seq reads are decomposed into kmers and projected onto kmers of transcripts; then expression levels of all transcripts are deconvoluted. Finally, transcript expression levels of the same gene are summarized to give a gene expression estimate. As a normalized expression metric for plots, we used Reads per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) reported by Saillfish. We used Sailfish version 0.6.2 with the following command lines:sailfish index -t <ref_transcripts> -o <out_dir> -k 20 for building transcriptome index file andsailfish quant -i indexfile -l ‘T = PE : O =><:S = AS’ -1 sample_R1.fastq -2 R2.fastq -o Sample1 for strand-specific quantification of read files. We downloaded the P. tetraurelia cDNA file from the Ensembl protists database release 26 (assembly version GCA_000165425). The quantification was done for 39,635 genes.After gene expression quantification, differential gene expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 version 319 in R. Following the DESeq2 guidelines, absolute read counts per gene as obtained from Sailfish were normalized between samples to account for differences in sequencing depth. Linear models to assess DE status were fit for each gene with DESeq2 using a negative binomial distribution. After multiple testing correction,20 genes with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01 were considered as differentially expressed.2.5. Transcriptome expression landscape visualization and analysisTo visualize and compare the transcriptome expression landscape for the different conditions, we applied a self-organizing map (SOM) approach using the oposSOM package.21 An SOM is a machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction, which transfers a high-dimensional data matrix (expression of all genes across different samples) to a lower dimension.The oposSOM package decomposes the data into clusters of correlated sets of genes, called metagenes, which are arranged in a fix order (here we use a lattice with dimension 20 by 20). The expression of a metagene represents the average expression of all genes in the cluster. Metagene expression values in the individual samples provide mosaic pictures visualizing condition specific over- and under-expression in terms of characteristic colour-coded textures, which allows the direct comparison of the expression of individual samples in a simple and intuitive way.TPM scale expression levels were log-transformed as pre-processing step for training the SOM. After training, we had sample-specific transcriptome expression landscapes as well over- and under-expressed hot spots for every sample. Sample-specific transcriptome landscapes represent the expression level of the metagenes at the respective sample while preserving the topological order of the metagenes in high dimension. Metagenes are grouped into co-regulated hot spots of similar up- or down-regulation using the following criteria: if <U+0394>e > MaxEXP * 0.9, where <U+0394>e is the expression level of the metagene under consideration and MaxEXP denotes the maximum expression of all metagenes, then the metagene is classified as over expressed. Analogously if <U+0394>e < MinEXP * 0.9, where MinEXP denotes the minimal expression of all metagenes, the metagene is classified as under-expressed. Metagenes with the same classification that group together in the SOM are called a regulated spot.Hierarchical clustering (average linkage mode) of expression values was conducted using R, heatmap2 function. We used two different setups for the creation. The first was based on Euclidean distance computation, which measures the distance between all entries in the expression vectors. The second was based on 1-Pearson correlation, which measures if genes follow similar trends independent of their differences in expression values. In all cases, no scaling was used.2.6. Gene ontology enrichmentThe gene ontology (GO) term association file has been created by processing the parameciumDB.gff3 file, downloaded from the ParameciumDB database.22 Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for every pairwise condition were divided into up- and down-regulated genes. We conducted GO enrichment analysis using Ontologizer (version 2.1) software using the Parent-Child-Union method for each set of up- or down-regulated genes in each pairwise comparison.233. Results and discussion3.1. Experimental designIt was the aim of this study to characterize gene expression patterns following epigenetically stabilized serotype expression in P. tetraurelia. We therefore analysed the transcriptomes of four different serotype pure cultures (51A, 51B, 51D, 51H) and furthermore characterized transcriptome alteration during cold adaptation, starvation and heat-shocks to compare epigenetically controlled gene expression patterns to short-time adaptation processes.All experiments were started with serotypically pure cultures, meaning that 100% of cells expressed one single surface antigen obviously by 100% immobilization to a specific antiserum.In this study, we analysed seven distinct conditions, three biological replicates each (Fig. 1): Serotype 51A expressing cultures cultivated at 31°C for >6 months (A.31).Serotype 51D expressing cultures cultivated at 24°C for >6 months (D.24).Serotype 51H expressing cultures cultivated at 14°C for >6 months (H.14).Three aliquots of the D.24 cultures subjected to a 20 min heat-shock at 39°C (D.HS).Three cultures (B.24) were grown from 51B expressing individuals, which were selected from the D.24 cultures by immobilization with anti-51D serum. Surviving individuals were subjected to autogamy and further cultivated at 24°C for 3 weeks.Three aliquots of the 51B cultures that were gradually adapted for lower temperatures (starting at 24°C, slow cool down to 14°C within 24 h, slow cool down to 6°C in 24 h) and then cultivated 3 weeks with permanent food supply at 6°C (B.6).Three aliquots of the D.24 cultures were subjected to autogamy and subsequently starved at 24°C for 3 weeks (D.starv).The experimental design and transcriptional landscape of individual cultures. The transcriptional landscape of analysed cultures is illustrated as a 3D heatmap of grouped genes. On the left side, the actual serotype is shown, meaning the surface antigen to which antiserum 100% of the cultures showed positive immobilization reaction at the time of RNA isolation. On the right side, the individual cultivation temperature is indicated (except the heat-shock cultures that were cultured at 24°C and were transferred to 39°C only for 20 min).The experimental design and transcriptional landscape of individual cultures.

On the right side, the individual cultivation temperature is indicated (except the heat-shock cultures that were cultured at 24°C and were transferred to 39°C only for 20 min).Replicate experiments are denoted with numeric suffixes, for example, the three replicate cultures of B.6 are denoted B.6-1, B.6-2 and B.6-3. As serotypes are expressed throughout the life cycle and usually in most individuals of a population, all cultures analysed in this study represent vegetatively growing non-synchronous cultures, thus representing individuals of different cellular age.To ensure that transcriptome differences do not result from activation of genes specifically activated during sexual recombination (autogamy), all cultures were checked for fragmented nuclei by DAPI staining prior to RNA isolation. In addition, Supplementary Fig. S1 shows gene expression profiles of different (early, intermediate, late induced) autogamy-related genes showing no significant activation in any culture.3.2. Analysis of DEGsAs P. tetraurelia had at least three whole-genome duplications, there are a number of genes that appear in more than one highly similar copy in the genome.24 This complicates gene expression estimates as reads may map to more than one location in the genome, potentially biasing estimates of non-expressed genomic copies of a gene. We used the Sailfish algorithm,18 which uses a global approach to optimize read placements on genes, to avoid false-positive expression signals of silent genes. We did a qualitative investigation by looking at the two highly similar genes SAg 51D and 51J (92.2% sequence identity) that we had previously measured with qPCR.12 Whereas the 51D gene has the highest expression in D serotype cultures, the 51J gene is silent, despite the highly similar sequence, and the same pattern is observed for the Sailfish estimates and with qPCR.After quantifying all gene expression values in the samples, we used a dimensionality reduction approach with SOMs to compare the expression landscapes between different conditions and their replicates (see Section 2). Figure 1 shows the transcriptional landscapes of all analysed cultures in 3D heatmaps. As expected, individual replicates are highly similar over the complete landscape, but may differ for smaller, individual gene groups, as seen for cultures A.31-3 and B.24-3. We decided to proceed the subsequent analysis also with these samples rather than to omit them as they represent biological fluctuations that cannot be neglected, but we are aware that some DEGs may become masked in the subsequent analyses merging all three replicates.At first glance, a similar but not identical landscape can be observed in the maps of the two cold-adapted experiments cultured at 6°C and 14°C (B.6 and H.14). More surprisingly, the serotype pure B.24 and D.24 cultures show entirely different patterns although cultivated under identical environmental conditions. In contrast, the heat-shocked and the starved cultures still show similarity to their origin, the D.24 samples. To describe the relationship between the individual cultures and conditions, we analysed DEGs in more detail.Using estimated gene read counts from the Sailfish analysis, we used the DESeq2 algorithm to compute pairwise DEGs between different conditions (see Section 2) and set a cut-off for DEGs at an FDR value of 0.01. Figure 2 shows complete numbers (Fig. 2A) and MA plots (Fig. 2B) of interesting comparisons as a detailed analysis of fold changes in relation to mean expression levels (further comparisons between conditions can be found in Supplementary Fig. S2). The plots support observed differences between the B.24 and D.24 cultures with 2,202 genes being significantly down-regulated in serotype 51D cells. As single 51B cells spontaneously appeared in the 51D cultures and were selected by immobilization, these differences suggest that the altered SAg, specific for the serotype, is not the only DEG but many more genes show altered gene expression. In contrast, the other two sets of variants of the D.24 condition, heat-shock and starvation, show less differences: in the former 587 up-regulated genes total in the latter case of starvation 3,123 genes; however, most of them showing a moderate down-regulation of ~log-fold change -2. The cold-adapted transcriptome of the B.6 cultures shows 1,709 down- and 1,472 up-regulated genes and therefore obviously a higher degree of alteration during cold adaptation compared with starvation. However, there is still a difference between the two sets of cold cultures B.6 and the H.14, which were adapted for a much longer time. In addition, the MA plot comparing A.31 and B.24 shows many genes that are differentially regulated although the total number of significantly DEGs is lower (639 up and 1,058 down) compared with the B.24 and D.24 comparison.

Comparison of individual transcriptome similarityTo get an overview of the global similarity between the different transcriptomes, we used hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance, average linkage) on the log-transformed TPM estimates. Figure 3 shows the clustering result as a heatmap, indicating transcription levels of all genes clustered according to their common expression behaviour in all analysed libraries. The dendrogram above the heatmap reflects the overall similarity between the transcriptome profiles. Excluding the D.24 and D.starved cultures, this analysis clearly clusters the individual biological replicates although few replicates (e.g. H.14-2 or D.HS-2) show divergence as indicated by comparing transcriptomic landscapes in Fig. 1. Comparing the D.24 and D.starv cultures, our analysis indicates that these still have similar transcriptomes: the D.starv cultures have been separated from the well-fed D.24 cultures and maintained without feeding bacteria for 3 weeks (Fig. 1). Relationship between transcriptomes of cultures and their replicates. Clustering heatmap showing expression levels (colour key on the left: green high and blue low expression) of the entire transcriptome per sample (bottom label).

The dendrogram (top) indicates the global similarity of the transcriptome profiles using hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance, average linkage) on the log-transformed expression values.As a first insight in the general comparison of the transcriptomes, the indication from the MA plots can be confirmed, because the two serotypes B.24 and D.24 that were cultured both under identical environmental conditions show huge differences and are clearly separated in the dendrogram (Fig. 3). This suggests indeed that the differences observed here are not due to the environmental temperature or other conditions, e.g. food or composition of medium, which were identical for both. In support of the latter conclusion, the two cold-adapted cultures B.6 and H.14 are clearly separated in Fig. 3 as the overall similarity of the transcriptome reveals large differences and clusters the B.6 cultures close to the B.24 conditions, from which they were derived.At first glance, the separation of the B.6 and H.14 transcriptomes in the dendrogram appears to be in conflict with the fact that both share the lowest number of DEGs (Fig. 2A). In comparison to the distance-based clustering in Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S3 shows a clustering obtained using Pearson correlation of gene expression values (see Section 2.5). Using correlation allows comparing gene expression patterns, despite their absolute differences in expression. In agreement with the low number of DEGs in the B.6/H14 comparison, both transcriptomes are clustered together in the second cluster analysis. We therefore conclude that a common mechanism of cold adaptation occurred in both the H.14 and the B.6 cultures (indicated by the low number of DEGs and clustering by Pearson correlation), but that expression of many genes in the B.6 cultures remains similar to expression in the parental B.24 cultures (see further analysis of these genes below).The lowest number of DEGs can be seen between D.24 and its heat-shocked portions D.HS. As the MA plot in Fig. 2 shows, the heat-shock is characterized mainly by strong activation of a certain number of genes, which explains the separation of the D.HS transcriptomes from the two other conditions of the serotype D cultures at 24°C in the dendrogram (Fig. 3).Figure 3 apparently shows that all cultures undergoing an environmental change (B.6, D.starv and D.HS) still cluster to their originating cultures. Although we did not necessarily expect a very high number of DEGs in the heat-shocked cultures, one would have expected greater differences in starvation and especially in the B.6 cultures. This suggests that these changes in the 3-week period led only to a partial rearrangement of the previously governing gene expression patterns.3.4. Cold adaptation by alterations of metabolic, DNA metabolic and translational alterationsFigure 4 shows enrichment of GO terms for biological processes and individual comparisons (complete lists of differential GOs for these comparisons can be found in Supplementary File 5). GO enrichment analysis results.

Bubble colour indicates significance of differential expression of an individual GO term (red low and blue high); the size (in log10P-value) indicates the percentage of genes annotated with a term in the reference database (UniProt) and thus indicates more general terms (large) and more specific ones (small). Most significant terms are labelled in the individual plot as well as representatives for groups of terms with lower significance. Green and red lateral arrows indicate the direction of regulation (up or down).GO enrichment analysis results.

Most significant terms are labelled in the individual plot as well as representatives for groups of terms with lower significance. Green and red lateral arrows indicate the direction of regulation (up or down).In all three warm/cold comparisons made here (B.6 vs. B.24; A.31 vs. B.6; A.31 vs. H.14), DNA metabolic GO terms including DNA biosynthesis and replication (initiation) are strongly up-regulated in the respective cold cultures. In addition, also oxidation/reduction processes are up-regulated in all cold-adapted cultures (only in the B.6 vs. B.24 comparison slightly below our set threshold). As this indicates higher energy metabolism, maybe due to the cold temperatures, this goes along with increased lipid catabolism in the B.6 cultures and with increased carbohydrate catabolism in H.14 cultures. As the representation of GO terms in Fig. 4 often reduced individual processes to parental GO terms (e.g. biological process), this indicates indeed that temperature adaptation alters many different processes, which require further investigation by subsequent experiments.3.5. GO term enrichment in starvation, heat-shock and serotype comparisonThe GO analysis indicates that starvation most significantly triggers microtubule-based processes and movement of cellular components, thus suggesting rearrangements of the cytoskeleton, probably because these starved cells do not undergo cell divisions. Up-regulated processes are DNA catabolism and lipid metabolism, indicating increased usage of lipids for energy metabolism.In the heat-shocked cultures, the most significant up-regulated GO term is ‘protein folding’ (GO: 0006457, Supplementary File 5), which involves the heat-shock response chaperones in agreement with our expectations. The GO enrichment displayed in Fig. 4 clearly shows that many other global processes are down-regulated. In the special situation of the heat-shock, these down-regulations may not be necessarily considered as controlled regulation of gene expression but also a by-product of thermal instability of individual mRNA species as discussed later.In general, the B.24 and D.24 comparison shows that many processes are down-regulated: the most significant one is again ‘oxidoreductase activity’ (GO: 0016491), indicating that the D.24 cultures have a lower energy metabolism compared with the B.24 cells, despite identical environmental cultivation conditions and thus food supply. In this comparison, also GO terms concerning ‘chromatin assembly’ become apparent in Fig. 4. A closer look reveals that chromatin-modifying enzymes are differentially expressed, namely genes of three histone deacetylase isoforms, chromodomain containing proteins and nuclear assembly proteins, and surprisingly the core histones themselves (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Several isoforms of histone genes H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are down-regulated in the D.24 cultures. Supplementary Fig. S4B and C show, for histone H3, that only those isoforms are down-regulated that are constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and that the expression of developmental specific isoforms is not affected.Further wet lab work has to clarify whether the global down-regulation of the core histones in our RNA-seq data indeed indicates a genome-wide loss of nucleosome occupancy: histone gene expression was described to be complex and to occur at several levels including post-transcriptional regulation.26 Therefore, our data do not allow for conclusions that indeed histone protein levels are strongly regulated here. However, if lower nucleosome occupancy would be true in the D.24 cultures, the high number of DEGs to the B.24 cultures might also be the result of a complex re-organization of the macronuclear chromatin.In yeast, cellular ageing was described to be accompanied by a loss of nucleosomes and a global transcriptional up-regulation,27 which is different to our observations as the D.24 cultures show more down-regulated genes. As the cells of the D.24 cultures were not synchronized in cellular age, we cannot rule out an age-dependent regulation of histones, although the down-regulation is maintained in the D.starv cultures, which represent 10–20 division old F1 individuals of the D.24 cultures.A similar result of decreased expression of the core histones was recently observed in P. tetraurelia by microarray analysis during silencing of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3 (RDR3), which resulted in a co-expression of SAgs accompanied with decreased expression of the core histones12 (M. Simon, unpublished data). As these cultures were of the same cellular age as the controls, any age-dependent influence can be ruled out in these experiments. Surprisingly, we observe a similar phenomenon of low core histone expression here in wild-type cultures of different serotypes. As RDR3 silencing is also accompanied with drastically decreased cells divisions,11 this was also observed for D.24 cultures, which showed slightly fewer cell divisions per day compared with the B.24 cultures (data not shown). As reduced histone supply was described to extend the S phase in Drosophila, the delivery with core histones turns out to be a crucial component regulating the cell cycle.28 Although the ciliate macronucleus divides amitotically, the prolonged cell cycle fits to our observations in the D.24 cultures and RDR3-silencing cultures.In support of this conclusion, the heat-shocked derivatives of the D.24 samples show a down-regulation of the core histones (Supplementary Fig. S4). Although we did not analyse the division rate of the heat-shocked cells, the down-regulation of the histones is consistent with a recent characterization of the heat-shock in the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas showing decreased histone expression by proteomic analysis; in this particular case, cells show an immediate stop of cell divisions.29It seems tempting to speculate here that Paramecium controls cell division also by histone supply although the underlying regulatory mechanisms and the involvement remain unclear, especially the involvement of the RDR3-associated RNAi machinery. In this context, recent work in the ciliate Stylonychia demonstrated that the knock down of the Stylonychia Piwi resulted in down-regulation of individual H3 isoforms, thus providing another example for the connection of RNAi and histone expression.30 Further studies have to clarify the role of histone gene expression and RNAi components as this would represent a powerful and new parameter of epigenetic influence to chromatin and genome integrity.3.6. Constitutive and regulated expression of HSP70 isoformsTen HSP70 isoforms have been described earlier for P. tetraurelia,6,7 and we added six more to the annotation, which were identified by a proteome-wide Pfam search (see Section 2 for details). Figure 5A shows the phylogenetic relationship between these isoforms and their putative subcellular localization. Figure 5B illustrates the TPM normalized expression levels of these HSP70 isoforms, where heat-inducible up-regulation can only be observed in the cytosolic group, in agreement with a previous analysis.7 All other HSP70 isoforms show constitutive expression.

The tree includes 10 previously described HSP70 genes (HSP70Pt01-10)6,7 and additionally identified HSP70 isoforms (HSP70Pt11-16).

(B) TPM normalized expression values for all described HSP70 isoforms in all samples are shown, and cells are coloured according to high (red) or low (blue) expression.The only cytosolic HSP70 isoform that shows high expression in all cultures is HSP70Pt-01, and interestingly this isoform also shows a second expression peak in D.24 and D.starv cultures. This does not seem to be due to the cultivation temperature, as lower expression can be observed at the same cultivation temperature in B.24 cultures (Fig. 5B). Similarly, also HSP70Pt-05 shows this activation in D.24 and D.starv cultures, however to a lower degree.Interestingly, a continuous up-regulation of HSP70 isoforms was recently also reported in Paramecium in response to endosymbionts, another form of external stress to the cell. The transcriptome comparison of Paramecium bursaria without and with endosymbiotic Chlorella ssp. algae revealed individual HSP70 isoforms up-regulated,31 and similar findings were also reported for infections with bacterial endosymbionts in Paramecium caudatum.32 Other studies suggest that bacterial symbiont bearing paramecia show an increased stress resistance,33 and the authors concluded that permanent HSP70 activation awards increased stress tolerance. Interestingly, symbiont-induced expression of HSP70 isoforms is shown to be permanent even after the removal of bacteria by antibiotics, indicating an epigenetic manifestation of this acquired gene expression.34 Here, our results support a permanent activation of an individual HSP70 isoform (HSP70Pt-01) in D.24 as well as the D.starv cultures but not in other samples.3.7. Expression pattern of the surface antigen multigene familyAs mentioned above, serotypes represent a special kind of differentiation process manifesting a gene expression pattern of the SAg family by epigenetic mechanisms: only one gene is expressed at a time.35 The most dominant environmental factor triggering serotype expression was described to be the temperature, and once induced they can be transferred to different cultivation conditions without serotype switches, thus indicating a self-stabilizing gene expression mechanism. Recent studies demonstrated that the core family consists of eight genes, some of them with a certain number of isoforms, indicated by Greek letters.12 In all our experiments we started with serotype pure cultures, meaning 100% of the cells responded to specific antiserum in the immobilization reaction. Figure 6A shows the gene expression levels based on TPM normalization. The figure shows high expression levels of the individual SAg that corresponds to the antiserum with which the cells reacted. This is not surprising for the A.31, B.24, D.24 and H.14 cultures. However, the B.6 cultures, which represent an aliquot of the B.24 cultures, still retain high expression of the 51B gene. This means that the expression of the 51B gene shows stable expression, even after 3 weeks at a temperature of 6°C. Typically, P. tetraurelia stock 51 expresses the 51H gene at low temperatures.36 Our data show that the 51H gene indeed has increased expression in the B.6 cultures, nevertheless the isolated cells still responded 100% to the 51B antiserum. This means that the actual serotype persists even drastically temperature changes. From our experience, it is likely that some individuals of the B.6 cells will indeed shift to 51H after several weeks more of cultivation at 14°C or 6°C, but production of serotype pure cultures will require the selection of 51H expressing individuals. In such a case, serotype shifts can indeed be triggered by temperature alterations, but the selection of individual transformants is required. Expression level of SAgs.

Additionally, the D.24 cultures are still highly similar to the D.starv cultures, and the serotype expression here indicates permanent expression of the 51D gene although slightly reduced (Fig. 6A). For these two examples of environmental alterations (food limitation: D.24 vs. D.starv) and extreme temperature shift (B.24 vs. B.6), our data show that the transcriptomes are indeed much more similar compared with the selected individuals of spontaneous transformants, namely the selected 51B expressing cells from the D.24 cultures that were cultivated under identical conditions.This suggests that spontaneously occurring transcriptome alterations, which may be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms similar to the serotype system, alter gene expression in Paramecium to a much higher degree compared with short-time adaptation to environmental changes.3.8. Many genes show co-regulation with the dominant SAg and sensitivity to heat-shocksTo see whether other genes are co-regulated with the surface antigens, we defined ‘regulated spots’ in the transcriptomes, which are characteristic sets of lowly or highly expressed genes per condition (Fig. 6B). Genes that are part of a spot show not only coherent up- or down-regulation in one individual sample, but moreover they are forming a group of co-regulated genes that behave similarly among all analysed conditions and samples.These data show that a huge number of genes are indeed co-regulated with individual antigens. These groups contain a large number of genes: on average between the replicates 2,468 genes in A.31, 1,180 in B.24 and 1,860 in D.24, thus representing a high percentage of the genome. In case of the B.24/D.24 comparison, the visualization of the regulated spots almost shows a mirror image of one another, thus explaining the clear separation of both states in the dendrogram (Fig. 3); it is still surprising that this difference is not due to environmental alterations but more likely due to spontaneous alterations. The short-time derivatives of these cultures (B.6 and D.starv) still show these spots (open arrow), although the pattern seems slightly different (Fig. 6B), thus indicating that a huge number of genes follows the expression behaviour of the SAg family and shows stability to environmental alterations within 3 weeks.Surprisingly, only the heat-shocked cultures (D.HS) alter serotype expression and, moreover, show a loss of the highly expressed spot of regulated genes, which was characteristic for all 51D expressing cultures. This means that a heat-shock of 20 min alters the expression of genes, which we discussed to be co-regulated with the epigenetically controlled SAg family.Comparing the transcript level of the cytosolic HSP70 isoforms per replicate to the expression levels of SAgs in Fig. 6C, the 51D mRNA is drastically reduced after 20 min heat-shock. This is apparent in the D.HS-1 and -3 cultures, and only to a lesser extent in the D.24-2 culture (only ~50% reduction). Further, comparing this with the HSP expression data, an inverse correlation becomes apparent: culture D.HS-2 also shows the lowest activation of the cytosolic HSP70 isoforms, thus indicating that this culture was only undergoing a moderate heat-shock but shows the lowest reduction of SAg 51D transcripts.As a consequence, SAg expression levels seem to be sensitive for heat-shocks which is supported by studies in the close relative Tetrahymena thermophila, where mRNA of variable surface antigens (Ser genes) was shown to be sensitive to heat-shocks; however, not necessarily because of physical instability but by active degradation by a de novo synthesized protein factor.37,38 This finding fits also very well to reports that a sudden change in temperature is much more efficient to induce serotype shifts compared with gradual changes.10In conclusion, we found that many genes in the Paramecium genome show expression patterns that correlate with serotype expression. Their expression behaviour is characterized by high expression levels, certain stability to environmental changes and the sensitivity to heat-shocks (Fig. 6B).As we know that heat-shocks induce serotype shifts more efficiently compared with more gradual changes and that the newly manifested serotype then becomes stabilized by epigenetic mechanisms, our finding that the entire spot of genes co-regulated with the SAg suggests that heat-shocks can induce widespread and long-term transcriptome alterations. In such case, the heat-shock could be interpreted as a kind of epigenetic reset on a large class of genes in the genome and would have an important influence on epigenetic memory.3.9. Specific activation of SAgs in subtelomeric regionsA TPE was recently reported to control SAg expression and silencing by RNA interference in P. tetraurelia.12 The classical TPE is believed to silence genes by a spreading of the heterochromatic state from the telomere into the subtelomeric regions, and this is believed to be involved in the regulation of variant surface antigens in a series of pathogenic microbes.39 However, it remains unknown how individual genes avoid silencing and become thus expressed. To see whether the activation of an SAg goes along with a general activation of genes in this particular subtelomere, we investigated these loci more in detail. Figure 7 shows the subtelomeric surrounding of macronuclear chromosomes harbouring the here investigated SAgs 51A, 51B, 51D and 51H. The position of telomeres is indicated by EOS (end of scaffolds) as predicted by the genome project resulting in a majority of closed scaffolds with telomeric repeats on both ends24 or by the letter ‘T’ in a triangle indicating internal telomeric sites.12 These internal telomeric sites are due to the ~800n polyploidy macronuclear chromosomes that exist in different length versions because of imprecise DNA elimination processes during maturation of small macronuclear chromosomes from larger micronuclear chromosomes.40 Figure 7 gives the combined information about gene position and expression levels of genes surrounding the respective SAg in all four serotype pure states 51A, 51B, 51D, 51H. The data do not indicate any events of spreading of heterochromatic silencing: on the one hand, activation of a subtelomeric SAg does not involve a loss of silencing of downstream genes (between SAg and telomere); on the other hand, the on/off state of the SAg does not apparently influence gene expression level of any neighbouring gene: their expression appears independent. As a conclusion, the TPE associated with SAg silencing and activation cannot be explained by a simple spreading of telomeric heterochromatin into subtelomeric regions, rather it seems more likely that the TPE influences SAg regulation in combination with a gene specific factor to specifically regulate one individual locus, thus avoiding global spreading events. Genomic map and expression of SAg and neighbouring genes in subtelomeric regions. Genomic maps of subtelomeric regions of scaffold 106 (SAg 51A), scaffold 142 (SAg 51H), scaffold 143 (SAg 51B) and scaffold 159 (51D) indicate individual ORFs by arrows (data from ParameciumDB22 and Baranasic et al.12). The position in the scaffold is indicated above in kbp (k). Expression level of the SAg and nearby genes (numbered by –X upstream and +X downstream relative to the SAg) are shown by TPM normalized data (logarithmic scale) in the graph below the genomic maps, respectively.

ConclusionsCell differentiation is mainly discussed in context of the ability of stem cells to differentiate into different tissues, i.e. an epigenetic mechanism manifests an individual gene expression pattern of the genome. Are these mechanisms for regulating and manifesting gene expression the only difference to phenotypic variation of unicellular eukaryotes?Paramecium was demonstrated in the past to differentiate its vegetative genome into different phenotypes with one prominent example in serotypes being regulated by epigenetically controlled heritable gene expression patterns whose regulation involves small RNA-induced chromatin regulation12,13 (Cheaib et al., in preparation). Interpretation of our transcriptome resource here indicates that not only the surface antigen multigene family but also many more genes follow the expression pattern of SAgs and show persistence while transcriptome adaptation to environmental changes. This suggests that gene expression patterns of gene groups can be manifested by epigenetic mechanisms and consequently that also unicellular species can differentiate into distinct epigenetically controlled phenotypes. However, such differentiation should be interpreted as a kind of transcriptomic robustness and needs to be distinguished from regular adaptation to environmental changes representing short-time flexibility for adaptation.It seems clear that our study can only estimate the extent of epigenetic differentiation by the above-discussed mechanisms, and the high number of genes co-regulated with the SAgs justifies future approaches to clarify the epigenetic mechanisms controlling and maintaining gene expression. Of special interest here is the heat-shock, as the data indicate that this might represent a trigger for chromatin remodelling, not only to activate individual HSP genes but for remodelling many more chromosomal loci.Our data suggest that serotypes cannot be restricted to the activation of a single gene as we identified a certain number of co-regulated genes, thus indicating that SAg expression is representative for individual gene expression profiles. Paramecium serotypes can be triggered by the environment or occur spontaneously (e.g. 51B cells in 51D cultures). It seems tempting to speculate that the co-regulated genes can be interpreted as a pre-installed genome program running to achieve a complex predetermined phenotype. We therefore need to clarify the epigenetic mechanisms allowing gene silencing, activation and maintenance of expression, to understand the epigenetic network that acts to coordinate the co-regulation of so many genes. Here, small RNA pathways, as indicated for the serotype system, would be an attractive hypothesis.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the starter grant by the Saarland University (61-cl/Anschub 2014/bew-Simon) and by grant SI 1397-2 by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to M.S.

IntroductionMouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are typically derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts.1,2 Remarkably, mESCs can be maintained in vitro for extended periods without losing their replicative capacity (self-renewal) or ability to differentiate into nearly all cell types except trophoblasts (pluripotency).3,4 Pluripotency has been studied intensively5,6 and is now understood to have states of different degree. For example, depending on the culture condition, mESCs can be maintained as a naive pluripotent state (ICM-like) or a primed pluripotent state (epiblast-like).7–9 It has also been proposed that mESCs are a heterogenous mixture of various transient pluripotent states with distinct expression levels of Nanog and other key transcription factors:10,11 mESCs would fluctuate among these states. Furthermore, recent reports proposed that mESCs can also take on a ‘totipotent’ state by acquiring the additional capacity to differentiate into trophoblast cells: the totipotent cells can be marked and isolated by their expression of the Hhex gene12 or the expression of a MuERV-L retrotransposon.13 As mESCs in the latter state were found to express some genes specifically activated in two-cell embryos, this particular totipotent state is called the ‘two-cell (2C) state’.13An equally remarkable though less studied feature of mESCs is their capacity to maintain genome stability and normal karyotype.14,15 We recently demonstrated that this feature involves the action of a mammalian-specific gene, Zscan4 (zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4). Originally identified as a gene expressed specifically in the two-cell mouse embryos, Zscan4 is not expressed in mESCs most of the time, but it is occasionally expressed transiently for several hours.16,17 Such a burst of Zscan4 transcription, called hereafter ‘Zscan4 event’ or ‘Z4 event’, is accompanied by transient expression of other two-cell or preimplantation genes.16–18 It has been shown that Z4 events are accompanied by critical biological events including rapid extension of telomeres17,18 and global blockage of translation.19 Because Z4 events occur rarely, Zscan4 is expressed in only 1–5% of ES cells at any given time in culture.16,17,20 Therefore, despite the occurrence of Z4 events in all mouse ES cell lines examined thus far,21 all the previous studies on mESCs have been obtained essentially with Zscan4- mESCs. To define the molecular events occurring during the Z4 events more clearly, we have compared gene expression profiles and the genome-wide chromatin conformations in isolated Zscan4+ cells and Zscan4- cells. Our study has revealed an unexpected link between Z4 event and changes in the conformation of heterochromatin.Mammalian genomes form two main chromatin structures: heterochromatin and euchromatin. Prototypical heterochromatin, often called ‘constitutive heterochromatin’, is in a tightly packed form and usually organizes on repetitive sequences such as centromeres, telomeres, and retrotransposons.22,23 Constitutive heterochromatin was considered transcriptionally silent, but recent studies have shown that constitutive heterochromatin can also be transcribed.24 In Schizosaccharomyces Pombe, it has been shown that constitutive heterochromatin is transcribed in S phase of every cell cycle, which is required for the timely assembly of constitutive heterochromatin.25 Another form of heterochromatin, the ‘facultative heterochromatin’, including repressed X-chromosome, is transcribed in some cell types.26–28 In this paper, we have identified a unique set of facultative heterochromatin regions that respond specifically to Z4 event (tentatively called ‘Z4 event-associated heterochromatin, zHC’). We have also provided the detailed molecular mechanism by showing that Z4 event is accompanied by transient rapid derepression and rerepression of both constitutive heterochromatin and zHC. We discuss biological significance of Z4 event.2. Materials and methods2.1. ES cell cultureMC1 ES cells (129S6/SvEvTac)29 were used for all experiments unless otherwise specified. Generation of MC1-ZE7 ES cells, Tet-Zscan4c ES cells, and Tet-shZscan4c ES cells has been described previously.17,30 All ES cell lines were maintained on gelatin-coated feeder-free plates in complete ES medium.17 In Tet-Zscan4c ES cells, Zscan4-Flag was repressed in the complete ES medium supplemented with 1.5 µg/ml of Dox, but induced in the absence of Dox. Tet-shZscan4c ES cells were cultured in the complete ES medium supplemented with 1.5 µg/ml of Dox to induce shRNA against Zscan4c. For immunofluorescense staining, ES cells were cultured on cover glass with mitomycin C-treated feeders.2.2. FACSSorting of MC1-ZE7 ES cells was performed using a BD FACSAria II. The cells were sorted according to the fluorescent intensity of Emerald.2.3. RNA-seqTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol solution (Roche) from FACS-sorted MC1-ZE7 cells following the manufacturer's instruction. The quality of total RNA was checked by Nanodrop (260/280 = 1.9–2.1, 260/230 > 2.0) and BioAnalyzer 2100 (RIN > 7). Five hundred nanograms of total RNA was used to make rRNA- and mtrRNA-free cDNA libraries using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). The cDNA was fragmented with alkaline-denatured fragmentation with 2 min at 94°C, which produced the fragments in 130–290 bp size range. The DNA libraries were quantified by KAPA quantification kit and sequenced by HiSeq 2500.2.4. AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used: mouse polyclonal anti-Zscan4 (Abnova H00201516- B01P), rabbit polyclonal anti-Zscan4,17 HP1a (Millipore MAB3584 for immunostaining, Millipore no. 05-689 for immunoblotting), H3K9me3 (Upstate no. 07-442), H4K20me3 (Millipore no. 07-463), H3K4me3 (Millipore no. 07-473), H3K9ac (Millipore no. 07-352), H3K14ac (Millipore no. 17-10051), H3K18ac (Epitomics no. 1766-1), H3K27ac (Active Motif no. 39-133 for immunostaining and ChIP, Abcam ab4729 for immunostaining and immunoblotting), H3K9me2 (Abcam ab1220), pan-H3 (Abcam ab1791), p300 (Millipore no. 05-257), CBP (Santa Cruz sc-583), HDAC1 (Abcam ab7028 for immunostaining, ab31263 for western blot), HDAC2 (ab7029), MTA1 (Bethyl lab.

Immunofluorescence stainingCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.25% NP-40 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. The cells were blocked for 10 min in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.2% saponin and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies (1 : 500) in a blocking solution. After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 : 500; Invitrogen) in a 1/10 blocking solution. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Roche) for 5 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was visualized by a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM 510 (Zeiss). Images were obtained using the Zeiss LSM software. The quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signals was conducted using the NIH Image program. The procedure for Immuno-DNA-FISH is included in the Supplementary Information.2.6. ChIP-seqChIP was performed using standard methods on FACS-sorted MC1-ZE7 cells (Em+/Em-). Sequencing analysis was performed on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II, and sequence reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm9) using Bowtie (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net). H3K27ac peaks were identified using HOMER (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/chipseq/). The details are described in the Supplementary Information.2.7. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the HELP tagging methodThe extraction of genomic DNA and the HELP tagging assay was performed as previously described31 with several modifications (see the Supplementary Information for details).2.8. Bisulfite sequencingGenomic DNA was subjected to bisulfite conversion using an EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). The bisulfite converted DNA was PCR amplified by EpiTaq HS polymerase (Takara) using the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using a SP6 primer.2.9. ImmunoprecipitationNuclear extract was prepared from Tet-Zscan4c ES cells after overexpressing Flag-tagged Zscan4 and diluted 5 times with IP buffer for immunoprecipitation. Nuclear extract and antibody were incubated at 4°C overnight and then washed 4 times with the IP buffer for 10 min at room temperature. The proteins were eluted with Laemmli's sample buffer for western blotting.3. Results3.1. Transcriptional bursts from specific genomic regions and constitutive heterochromatin during a Z4 eventTo characterize the transcriptome specific to the transient Z4 event, we carried out RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses with isolated Zscan4+ and Zscan4- cells. To separate the two kinds of cells, we FACS-sorted the MC1-ZE7 cell line,17 in which an Emerald fluorescence protein (Em) was controlled by the Zscan4 promoter, distinguishing strongly Em+ (i.e. Zscan4+) from Em- (i.e. Zscan4-) cells (Fig. 1A and B). Over 35 million reads per sample were mapped to non-repetitive regions of the mouse genome in two biological replications, detecting 24,538 genes (RefSeq). We found that among 476 differentially expressed genes (fold change > 2, FDR < 0.05), nearly all (469) were more highly expressed in Zscan4+ cells than in Zscan4- cells (Supplementary Table S2). This result indicates that a specific molecular program is activated and superimposed on the regular mESC program. The findings were consistent with previous microarray analyses.18 For brevity, we refer to genes specifically up-regulated during Z4 event as ‘Z4 event-associated genes (ZAGs).’ The ZAGs included many preimplantation embryo genes such as Zscan4, Tmem92, Gm428, and Tcstv3, whose differential expression was also confirmed by quantitative PCR (Fig. 1C). During Z4 event, essentially all Zscan4 paralogues were abundantly transcribed from their canonical transcription start sites; six newly identified copies of Tmem92 were also abundantly transcribed (Supplementary Fig. S1A), suggesting that expression of these genes is strictly controlled even though they are only expressed for a very short time.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We also mapped the RNA-seq reads to repetitive regions of the mouse genome (Fig. 1A). The analysis revealed significant increases of transcripts from repetitive sequences that are usually packed in silenced chromatin (constitutive heterochromatin), including major satellites, minor satellites, and telomeres during Z4 event (Fig. 1D). Increases of transcription from many retrotransposons were also detected (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Comparable activation of retrotransposons has already been reported in MuERV-L-marked mESCs (2C state).13The burst of transcription from usually silent constitutive heterochromatin might be considered anomalous. However, the constitutive heterochromatin is highly transcribed in mouse preimplantation embryos, and the transcripts are required for proper embryonic development.32,33 This may indicate that a burst of constitutive heterochromatin transcription during Z4 event is also a part of normal physiological processes in mESCs.3.2. Histone acetylation in heterochromatin increases during the Z4 eventThe unusual transcriptional burst from constitutive heterochromatin during Z4 event prompted us to examine the histone modifications involved in the regulation of transcriptionally active chromatin: histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 9, 14, and 27 acetylation (H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K27ac). We found higher levels of these active histone modifications, especially H3K27ac, in the Zscan4+ cells compared with Zscan4– cells (Fig. 2A and SupplementaryFig. S2A). This finding was further supported by the quantification of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B, P < 0.001) and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 2C). Activation of heterochromatin in the Zscan4+ cells. (A) ES cells were co-immunostained for Zscan4 (not shown) and euchromatin markers—H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K27ac (green). DNA was counterstained with DAPI (red).

The MC1-ZE7 cells were FACS-sorted into cells with Em+ (i.e. Zscan4+ cells) and cells with Em- (i.e. Zscan4- cells) and analysed by the immunoblotting. See also Supplementary Fig. S2.Activation of heterochromatin in the Zscan4+ cells.

The MC1-ZE7 cells were FACS-sorted into cells with Em+ (i.e. Zscan4+ cells) and cells with Em- (i.e. Zscan4- cells) and analysed by the immunoblotting. See also Supplementary Fig. S2.As expected, we also found that specifically in the Zscan4+ cells, histone acetylations—particularly H3K27ac—localized not only in euchromatin but also in heterochromatin—DAPI-dense regions (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). This was further confirmed by colocalization with major satellite (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and heterochromatin-specific protein—HP1a (heterochromatin protein 1a) (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The association of heterochromatin with active histone modifications is consistent with a burst of constitutive heterochromatin transcription during Z4 event.3.3. H3K27ac is enriched in constitutive heterochromatin and ZAGs during the Z4 eventAmong the histone modifications we examined thus far, H3K27ac showed the greatest up-regulation and the most specific nuclear localization in a Z4 event-specific manner. Therefore, we decided to identify the genomic localization of H3K27ac by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). To compare the genome-wide H3K27ac distributions reliably, we carried out ChIP-seq in duplicate using two independently FACS-sorted samples of Em+ and Em- cells (Fig. 3A). The independently replicated ChIP-seq results showed remarkable consistency, indicating the high specificity of H3K27ac ChIP-seq signals. We first analysed sequence reads that matched to repetitive sequences. Consistent with the immunostaining analyses, the number of sequence reads matched to major satellites and telomeres was 4- and 2-fold higher in the Em+ cells than in the Em- cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). Similarly, retrotransposons were more abundantly marked with H3K27ac in Em+ cells than in Em- cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). These results further support the involvement of H3K27ac in the transcriptional burst from repetitive sequences during Z4 event.

(E) Localizations of ZAGs (purple) and zH3K27ac peaks (blue) on mouse genomes. See also Supplementary Fig. S3.We next analysed sequence reads matching non-repetitive sequences. H3K27ac peaks with significantly more (>3-fold) sequence reads in the Em+ cells compared with that in the Em- cells were identified, resulting in 1,429 peaks—tentatively named ‘Z4 event-associated H3K27ac peaks (zH3K27ac peaks)’ (Fig. 3C). The majority of these zH3K27ac peaks were located in intronic and intergenic regions (Supplementary Fig. S3B) and away from transcription start sites (TSSs) (Supplementary Fig. S3C). These results are consistent with H3K27ac function as a transcriptional active mark at enhancers.34 Indeed, the locations of zH3K27ac peaks were positively correlated with genes whose expression was higher in Em+ cells than in Em- cells, that is ZAGs (Fig. 3D and E), suggesting that the expression of ZAGs is also regulated by H3K27ac at their enhancers. Overlap between ZAGs and zH3K27ac was even more clearly observed when more stringent thresholds were used: 150 (59%) of 253 ZAGs (>5-fold Em+/Em- expression difference) were located within 0.5 Mb from zH3K27ac peaks (P = 6 × 10-6).3.4. zH3K27ac peaks are located in facultative heterochromatin, silenced in Zscan4- cells, but activated during Z4 eventThe analyses thus far indicated that repetitive sequences such as major satellites, telomeres, and retrotransposons, which are located in usually silenced heterochromatin, acquire H3K27ac marks and are transcribed. Are zH3K27ac peaks located in non-repetitive genomic regions also silenced and heterochromatinized in mESCs most of the time, but acquire H3K27ac marks and transcribed in a Z4 event-specific manner?To address this question, we examined the association of zH3K27ac peaks with previously published chromatin features in mouse ES cells—essentially equivalent to Zscan4- cells (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S3, Fig. S4). Remarkably, zH3K27ac peaks were found to be enriched for heterochromatin features, that is high levels of DNA methylation;35 Lamin B1 binding;36 and H3K9me2 marks.37 These results suggest that not only the repetitive sequences such as major satellites (pericentromeres) and telomeres, but also zH3K27ac peaks such as ZAGs are enveloped in heterochromatin in the Zscan4- cells. In other words, pericentromeres, telomeres, retrotransposons, and unique sets of genes such as ZAGs are usually in heterochromatin in mESCs, but are transiently activated during Z4 event.

See also Supplementary Fig. S4.To further examine the epigenetic changes specific to the Z4 event, we carried out DNA methylation analysis by the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR) assay on Em+ and Em- cells. As expected, zH3K27 peaks were enriched with high levels of DNA methylation (Fig. 4B). However, the levels of DNA methylation in the zH3K27ac peaks were slightly reduced in Em+ cells compared with Em- cells (Fig. 4B). For example, the regulatory regions of representative ZAGs such as Tmem92 and Tdpoz4 showed H3K27ac and DNA hypomethylation (Fig. 4C)—a finding confirmed independently by bisulfite sequencing of the regions (Fig. 4D). Thus, both repetitive sequences and non-repetitive ZAGs are transcriptionally silenced and heterochromatinized in Zscan4- cells (usual mESCs), but become transcriptionally active, acquiring H3K27ac—active histone modifications and DNA demethylation. For brevity, we call the subset of facultative heterochromatin where zH3K27ac and ZAGs are located ‘zHC’.3.5. Zscan4 forms complexes with chromatin remodellers during the Z4 eventTo explore which chromatin remodelling factors are related to changes in heterochromatin during Z4 event, we examined protein complexes associated with Zscan4. We used an anti-Flag antibody and a previously established ES cell line (tet-Zscan4c ES cells), in which an exogenous Zscan4 fused to a Flag-tag can be induced by switching from the Dox+ to the Dox- condition.30 Immunoblot analysis of proteins extracted from these cells (Dox- condition, i.e. Zscan4-induced condition) and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography identified a ~70 KD Zscan4 band, which was present from ~150 KD to ~2,000 KD with a major peak at ~500 KD, suggesting that Zscan4 proteins, when expressed, can form protein complexes of various sizes (Supplementary Fig. S5A).Next, protein mixtures from each column fraction were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag antibody and subjected to mass spectrometry analyses. After removing common contaminants often detected by Flag-tag-based IP mass spectrometry, the number of identified peptides for each protein by mass spectrometry was tabulated for each protein fraction (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The analyses revealed that Zscan4 complexes contained primarily repressing chromatin remodelling complexes (HDAC1, HDAC2, LSD1/KDM1A, NuRD, Sin3A), but also showed evidence of activating chromatin remodelling complexes (SWI/SNF). Zscan4 complexes also contained KAP1—one of the key proteins in the regulation of heterochromatin. Consistent with the mass spectrometry data, protein mixtures pulled down by Flag-IP contained Zscan4, LSD1/KDM1A, MTA1 (NuRD), BRG1 (SWI/SNF), and KAP1 (Fig. 5A); and protein mixtures pulled down by LSD1-IP, MTA1-IP, and BRG1-IP, respectively, all contained Zscan4, MTA1, BRG1, HDAC1, and KAP1. These results suggest that both activating and repressing chromatin remodelling complexes are associated with Zscan4 protein. Both activating and repressing chromatin remodelling complexes localize in heterochromatin in the Zscan4+ cells. (A) Immunoblot analyses of Flag-Zscan4, Lsd1/Kdm1a, Mta1, Brg1, Hdac1, and Kap1/Trim28 proteins after immunoprecipitating the nuclear extracts of tet-Zscan4 ES cells by antibodies against Flag-tag, Lsd1/Kdm1a, Mta1, and Brg1.

See also Supplementary Fig. S5.To further verify Zscan4-dependent colocalization of these chromatin remodelling complexes on heterochromatin, we carried out the immunostaining analyses of these proteins in mouse ES cells (Fig. 5B). For the activating chromatin remodelling complexes, the staining of BRG1 was similar for Zscan4+ and Zscan4- cells, but the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), p300 and CBP, which are known to specifically mediate the acetylation of H3K27,38 accumulated in the heterochromatin labeled with anti-centromere antibody in a Z4 event-specific manner. For the repressing chromatin remodelling complexes, HDAC1, HDAC2, MTA1, MTA2, Rbbp4, and Rbbp7, all of which are components of the NuRD complex,39 were localized in the heterochromatin in a Z4 event-specific manner. The staining of LSD1 was observed in both euchromatin and heterochromatin, but was stronger in the Zscan4+ cells than in Zscan4- cells. As a control, KAP1, heterochromatin marker, was detected in heterochromatin both in the Zscan4+ and Zscan4- cells. Interestingly, Zscan4 staining showed its localization not only in pericentromeric heterochromatin, but also in euchromatic regions, suggesting the detection of zHC, which are located in euchromatin. Alternatively, these results may indicate that Zscan4 functions not only in heterochromatin, but also in euchromatin. Overall, the heterochromatin is associated with both activating and repressing chromatin remodelling complexes during Z4 event (though a single site probably moves through a cycle of derepression and rerepression; see below).3.6. Pericentromeric heterochromatin clusters around nucleolus during Z4 eventThe results thus far indicate that heterochromatin is transiently in an activated conformation in a Z4 event-specific manner. We suspected that Z4 event-specific activation of heterochromatin has some unique features. A hint came from the immunohistochemical analysis of histone modifications during Z4 event (Fig. 2A). We noticed the clustering of heterochromatin in a Z4 event-specific manner and further investigated the distribution of heterochromatin in nuclei by costaining for Zscan4 and HP1a. In the great majority (~95%) of ESCs, which were Zscan4-, heterochromatin recognized by HP1a appeared as discrete multiple foci scattered in the nucleoplasm and overlapping regions of high DNA density detected by DAPI (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). This pattern of heterochromatin localization is commonly observed in mESCs and other cell types.40 In contrast, during Z4 event the heterochromatin appeared in larger and fewer clusters that also overlapped with the regions of high DNA density, mostly perinucleolar (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). These observations were confirmed by quantitative morphometric analyses of a large number of cells: heterochromatin foci in Zscan4+ cells were significantly larger (Fig. 6B, P < 0.001) and fewer (Fig. 6C, P < 0.001) compared with those in Zscan4- cells. The clustering and relocalization of heterochromatin during Z4 event were also confirmed by immunostaining for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3—histone modifications associated with heterochromatin (Supplementary Fig. S6B and C).

See also Supplementary Fig. S6.Heterochromatin foci are known to be composed of pericentromeric regions that contain major satellite DNA repeats.41 Indeed, DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses using probes specific to major satellites and telomeres showed clustering of major satellite repeats specifically during Z4 event (Supplementary Fig. S6D). In contrast, clustering of telomeres was not seen (Supplementary Fig. S6D).As far as we know, this is the first report for heterochromatin clustering into a large cluster. Taken together, these results indicate that the unusual clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin occurs transiently as a unique feature of Z4 event.3.7. Zscan4 plays active roles in the epigenetic modifications of heterochromatin during Z4 eventAll the dynamic changes in heterochromatin described thus far occurred specifically in Zscan4+ cells, that is a small fraction (1–5%) of ESCs in culture. Previously we have shown that Zscan4 is a causative gene for biological events occurring specifically during Z4 event (see Discussion). Therefore, we expected that Zscan4 causes rapid derepression and rerepression of heterochromatin in a Z4 event-specific manner. To test this notion, we examined heterochromatin dynamics in both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies of Zscan4.For the loss-of-function assays, we generated a mESC line carrying a Dox-inducible shRNA (short hairpin RNA) directed against Zscan4. We confirmed that Dox-induced shRNA expression for 8 days decreased the fraction of Zscan4+ mESCs (Fig. 7A). In these Zscan4 knockdown cell colonies, the number of cells displaying H3K27 acetylation in heterochromatin was significantly reduced (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, the expression of major satellites was decreased by ~50% in Zscan4 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A, P < 0.01).

Tel., telomeres, Pericent., pericentromeres, Retro., retrotransposons, ZAGs, Z4 event-associated genes. See also Supplementary Fig. S7.For the gain-of-function assays, we examined whether ectopic overexpression of Zscan4 can induce these epigenetic changes in mESCs, using the tet-Zscan4 ES cell line.30 As expected, the overexpression of Zscan4, which was confirmed by the western blot (Fig. 7C), increased the number of cells stained with Zscan4 antibodies (Fig. 7D). Zscan4+ cells were also strongly stained with the H3K27ac in the heterochromatin (Fig. 7D) and the H3K9ac (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analyses showed that the overexpression of Zscan4 up-regulated H3K27ac on Tmem92, Tdpoz3/4, Zscan4c/d regions (Supplementary Fig. S7C, P < 0.05). Next, we carried out MeDIP-seq (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) analyses and found that the overexpression of Zscan4 induced the demethylation of DNAs in telomeric and major satellite regions—and to some extent in minor satellite regions (Supplementary Fig. S7D). Subsequent analyses of non-repeated genome regions revealed that the overexpression of Zscan4 also induced the demethylation of DNAs in the zH3K27ac peaks (Supplementary Fig. S7E).4. DiscussionThe Z4 event—a short burst of Zscan4 transcription—occurs very infrequently in usual mESC culture conditions, so that only 1–5% of mESCs are undergoing Z4 event at a given time.16–18 However, essentially all mESCs undergo Z4 event at least once within nine passages.17 In this paper, we have carried out detailed molecular analyses of the Z4 event, finding that it coincides with rapid and unusual molecular changes in chromatin, particularly in heterochromatin (Fig. 7E).4.1. Heterochromatin regulation and dynamics during Z4 eventConstitutive heterochromatin is usually considered silenced for transcription. However, as summarized in Fig. 7E, during the Z4 event, constitutive heterochromatin shows a burst of transcription. Generally, gene activation is accompanied by ‘open’ chromatin with enrichment of active marks and loss of repressive marks on their regulatory regions.42 In fact, we saw increased levels of activating histone marks, H3K27ac, reduced levels of DNA methylation, along with clustering around nucleoli (Fig. 7E). At the same time, repressive marks, H3K9me2, and DNA methylation were still abundant in the acetylated active heterochromatin. These results suggest that the transcriptional burst is induced from ‘open’ heterochromatin, but the heterochromatin immediately returns to its silent conformation.In addition to the constitutive heterochromatin, we also observed ‘zHC’ that comprise a few hundred ‘ZAGs’, including Zscan4, which show a burst of transcription during Z4 event. Although zHC is not located in the constitutive heterochromatin region and forms scattered clusters throughout the genome (Fig. 3E), we show that in regular mESCs zHC is transcriptionally silenced and shares features of heterochromatin such as high levels of DNA methylation and the lack of activating histone marks. However, as summarized in Fig. 7E, during the Z4 event, zHC also shows a burst of transcription, with increased levels of activating histone marks, H3K27ac, and reduced levels of DNA methylation (Fig. 7E). Because H3K27ac marks distal enhancers associated with active genes34 and is important for recruiting Pol II to regulatory regions to initiate transcription,38 it is likely that the burst of transcription of ZAGs from the zHC is controlled by H3K27ac.The rapid and profound changes in heterochromatin during Z4 event are rather unusual, even considering the already unusual chromatin features of regular mESCs,43 such as a bivalent structure,44,45 dynamic plasticity,46 and non-CpG methylation.47 These chromatin changes specific to Z4 event suggest that mESCs undergo rapid derepression followed by the immediate rerepression of both constitutive heterochromatin and zHC during the Z4 event (Fig. 7E). This notion is further supported by our finding that both activating chromatin remodelling complexes (HATs, SWI/SNF) and repressing chromatin remodelling complexes (HDAC1, HDAC2, LSD1/KDM1A, NuRD) gather on heterochromatin during Z4 event. Simultaneous modifications of both constitutive heterochromatin and zHC are also intriguing, as it has been shown that different enzymes are involved in the histone methylation of constitutive heterochromatin and facultative heterochromatin (including zHC): Suv39h1/h2 for constitutive heterochromatin and G9a for facultative heterochromatin.48 It remains to be clarified whether these enzymes are involved in Z4 events.4.2. Biological significance of Z4 eventIt has been shown that Z4 event is required for the maintenance of telomere length and genome stability.17 Also, increasing the frequency of Z4 event by the forced expression of Zscan4 in mESCs can improve their quality (i.e. the extent of chimerism when injected into blastocysts).18 Our finding that Z4 event is accompanied by the activation of both constitutive heterochromatin and zHC was therefore not anticipated, because it is generally thought that the relaxation of heterochromatin leads to genome instability and deterioration of cells.49–51 For example, the transcription of retrotransposons, which are usually repressed, is known to produce insertional mutations and genome instability.52 Why then would mESCs undergo Z4 event? One speculative possibility is that going through a usually forbidden transition to heterochromatin activation permits the repair of DNA damage in the heterochromatin. It is known that when DNA in tightly packed heterochromatin is damaged, the heterochromatin must be opened so that the DNA repair machinery can access the DNA.53 The otherwise harmful effects of transcriptional burst from heterochromatin could be countered by blocking the translation of the RNAs: we have shown previously that Z4 event is accompanied by the block of global protein synthesis through the activation of two-cell-specific Eif1a-like genes.19Dynamic changes of heterochromatin during Z4 event are also consistent with the significant biological ‘corrections’ such as the extension of telomeres17 and the alleviation of karyotype abnormality.18 For example, transcription of telomeres is known to be positively correlated with telomere length.22,54 Also, activation and clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin would be consistent with involvement of the Z4 event in chromosome segregation, because this is indeed the chromosome region where the assembly of kinetochore and other transactions critical for chromosome segregation occur.55Of course, the unusual properties of Z4 event must have a function apart from the maintenance of artificially produced mESCs. The Z4 event can be considered a normal part of mammalian development and tissue homeostasis. For example, the burst of Zscan4 expression can be observed in late two-cell embryos during mouse preimplantation development;16 in four to eight cell embryos during human preimplantation development;56 and in rare adult cells that most likely include tissue stem cells.57 The burst of Zscan4 is required for preimplantation embryo development, as its knockdown causes developmental defects.16 In the mouse preimplantation embryos, Z4 event seems to occur during the late two-cell embryo—a stage when genomes derived from sperm and oocyte initiate massive transcription.58 During that short period, major satellites and retrotransposons located in constitutive heterochromatin,32,33 and many ZAGs located in zHC13,18 also show a burst of transcription. Clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin has also been observed in two-cell embryos, although they appear to surround nucleoli more uniformly.59,604.3. Z4 event versus 2C stateRecent studies have revealed that in standard culture conditions mESCs fluctuate among distinct transient states, resulting in their heterogenous mixture.10,11 However, these states do not seem to be intrinsically transient, because mESCs can be maintained stably in a specific state depending on the culture condition, for example in a naive pluripotent state or a primed pluripotent state.7–9 Considering its short duration and its role in genome stability, we call a short burst of Zscan4 transcription ‘Zscan4 event’ or ‘Z4 event’ in this paper, so that it can be operationally distinguished from various pluripotency states. The need for such distinction seems to be further supported by the data presented in this manuscript. However, our view seems to contradict with the recent view expressed by some other authors who inferred that Zscan4+ cells, in which two-cell-specific Zscan4 is expressed, are essentially the same as cells in the 2C state.13,61,62 The ‘two-cell (2C) state’ is one of the transient mESC states identified recently as a totipotent state using the expression of a MuERV-L retrotransposon as a marker.13 However, there are some differences between them. For example, unlike mESCs in the totipotent 2C state,13 mESCs undergoing a Z4 event (i.e. Zscan4+ mESCs) contribute inefficiently to chimeric mice when injected into blastocysts and thus seem to temporarily lack pluripotency.184.4. Molecular functions of Zscan4Previously we have shown that the ectopic expression of Zscan4 per se can trigger biological events that occur specifically during Z4 events in mESCs. For example, the length of telomeres can be extended within a few days after ectopic expression of Zscan4,17 and the efficiency of contribution to chimeric mice can be dramatically improved by the forced expression of Zscan4.18 We have also shown that the forced expression of Zscan4 induces the expression of Tmem92, Tcstv1, Tcstv3, and other ZAGs.18 However, it has not been clear how Zscan4 functions and is molecularly involved in these biological events.Here we have shown that at least some of the heterochromatin changes associated with Z4 events can be triggered by ectopic expression of Zscan4. It is interesting to note that telomeric heterochromatin shows an increase of transcription and H3K27ac as well as a decrease of DNA methylation during a Z4 event. Because it is known that such epigenetic changes of telomeric heterochromatin cause the extension of telomeres by recombination,22,54 these data suggest the molecular mechanism for rapid extension of telomeres by the forced expression of Zscan4.17With the identification of Zscan4-associated protein complexes by Immunoprecipitation–Mass spectrometry analyses, we have revealed that Zscan4 forms complexes with many distinct proteins, including both activating and repressing chromatin remodellers. The association of Trim28 (Kap1) also indicates the localization of at least some of the Zscan4 protein complexes on heterochromatin. The notion that Zscan4 functions through specific protein–protein interaction is consistent with the known molecular function of the SCAN domain as a mediator of protein–protein interaction.634.5. ConclusionHere we have shown that mESCs undergo dramatic epigenetic changes to regulate transient activation and repression of specific heterochromatin regions, a process that is likely an intrinsic part of a special mechanism for the maintenance of genome stability. In contrast to S. Pombe where constitutive heterochromatin is transcribed in S phase of every cell cycle,25 Z4 events occur infrequently in mESCs cultured in the standard condition.

IntroductionRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology enables whole-transcriptome profiling via the collection and mapping of short cDNA fragments (reads) to a reference genome.1,2 Regions of the genome where many reads align indicate such regions are highly expressed.3 Regions where no known gene has been annotated and a large number of reads align are indicative of an undiscovered gene.4Reconstruction of transcripts can be obtained through a variety of computational strategies, each of which has its own benefits and drawbacks. These assembly algorithms fall into two general classes, ab initio assembly and de novo assembly. Ab initio, mapping-first approaches rely on the availability of a reference genome to which the short reads can be aligned.5 The major drawback of this method stems from the dependency of accurate transcript identification on the presence of a high-quality reference genome.6 The main benefit of ab initio assembly is the maximum sensitivity exhibited for gene identification,5,7 though higher sensitivity tends to result in a lower accuracy due to a higher number of false-positive genes being reported.7 On the other hand, de novo transcript assembly, or assembly-first approaches, is independent of a reference genome and directly determines the transcripts of a genome through the short reads.5 Since this avenue is dependent solely on short-read data, genes with low read coverage due to low expression levels can result in inaccurate determination of full-length transcripts.8 The main benefit provided by de novo assembly methods is the lack of reliance on a reference genome, which makes it a vital tool for gene identification in organisms that lack a reference genome. Thus, both genome biology as well as the availability of an accurate and complete genome play major factors in the decision to use ab initio assembly versus de novo assembly.7Recently, we published a clustering algorithm to identify novel protein- and microRNA-coding genes by searching only the unannotated regions of the rice genome.9 However, this method relied on the genome being partially annotated. Analysis of the RNA-seq data with other transcript assembly software revealed that they failed to identify genes, were CPU intensive, or lacked documentation or recent software updates. Here, we report an improved algorithm for ab initio transcript assembly and novel gene identification, Tiling Assembly, to compensate for such shortfalls.By combining Tiling Assembly with Cufflinks,10 thousands of potential novel genes were identified in the rice genome. To reduce the possibility of false-positive novel gene identification, stringent filters on minimum gene length, minimum gene expression level, and percent similarity of the potential novel genes to another region in the genome were included. Utilizing this pipeline, 767 high-confidence, unannotated genes were identified in the rice genome. By applying Tiling Assembly to other model organisms, we identified 200 potential novel genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, 126 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 361 in Drosophila melanogaster, and 460 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study demonstrated that, by utilizing Tiling Assembly, many potential novel genes can be identified in even the most well-annotated genomes.2. Materials and methods2.1. The Tiling Assembly pipelineThe Tiling Assembly pipeline, depicted in Fig. 1, begins with alignment of RNA-seq short-read data to the appropriate genome using the alignment software, Bowtie10 and Tophat.11 Exons of potential genes are identified based on the presence of regions containing overlapping reads. Exons too short to be identified by read alignment are identified by Tophat junction alignments. Gaps in the read coverage can cause single exons to be identified as two or more exons; thus, exons that are very closely spaced are linked together. To prevent accidental merging of exons, exons containing one or more junction alignments are separated into multiple exons. Finally, all of the exons identified are joined together by the junction alignments to form the assembled transcripts. Flowchart of the processes for gene identification by Tiling Assembly.Flowchart of the processes for gene identification by Tiling Assembly.Gene identification begins with the detection of exons based on the short-read data. The aligned reads are loaded into a MySQL database, which is queried by Tiling Assembly to identify exons based on the presence of overlapping reads. To prevent misidentification of exons due to noise, a threshold may be set by the user to determine the minimum reads per kilobase of exon (RPKE) required to identifying an exon.Exons shorter than the length of a read (50 nt) tend to have few to no reads aligned, regardless of gene expression, preventing them from being detected by considering only read alignment. To identify these short exons, Tiling Assembly relies on the partial read alignments from junction mapping. Tophat takes the reads that cannot be directly mapped to the genome and breaks them into two parts for independent alignment. The junctions that these reads map across are indicative of an intron. Tiling Assembly relies on these partial read alignments to detect short exons (Supplementary Fig. S1).Low read coverage from genes with low expression often leads to gaps in the read coverage, causing alignment algorithms to mistakenly identify multiple exons where only a single exon is present. To avoid such false gaps, Tiling Assembly merges exons that are within a user-specified distance of each other. Linking closely spaced exons together, however, may result in an incorrect merging of exons.Other factors, such as intron retention, pre-spliced mRNA, and noise, may also contribute to incorrectly merged exons because they result in reads mapping to intronic regions (Supplementary Fig. S2). To prevent mistakenly merged exons, Tiling Assembly searches for junction alignments within the identified exons. Exons containing both sides of a junction alignment are separated and trimmed based on the boundaries of the junction to ensure accurate exon–intron boundaries (Supplementary Fig. S3). The beginning of the first exon and the end of the last exon of a transcript cannot be determined by junction alignment.Once these high-confidence exons are produced, Tiling Assembly assembles the exons into specific genes using junction alignments. To avoid false junctions between similar genomic regions, the user can specify a maximum length of a junction that skips over one or more exons (Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, the user can specify the size of very large junctions to be disregarded to avoid invalid junctions due to mapping errors.2.2. RNA-seq and genome dataThe RNA-seq data used for rice were obtained from RNA extraction of rice aleurone performed in our laboratory, followed by library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina Hi-seq 2000 platform by the Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah. The data were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)12 and are publicly accessible under the accession number SRP028376. The SRA accession numbers that were used for the analysis of other species were SRP022162 (A. thaliana), SRR590802-4 (D. melanogaster), SRR650494-5 (C. elegans), and SRR1019759 (S. cerevisiae). The rice genome and annotation were downloaded from the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Release 7.0 (MSU R7)13 for Oryza sativa (ftp://ftp.plantbiology.msu.edu/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/o_sativa/annotation_dbs/pseudomolecules/version_7.0/).The A. thaliana data were downloaded from the PhytozomeV1014 (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/pages/dynamicOrganismDownload.jsf?organism=PhytozomeV10).The C. elegans data were downloaded from the WormBase15 (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/fasta/caenorhabditis_elegans/dna/).The yeast data were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database16 (http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/).The D. melanogaster data were downloaded from the FlyBase17 (ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r5.56_FB2014_02/fasta/).2.3. Alignment of full-length cDNA to the rice genomeThe full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs)18 were aligned to the rice genome using the Exonerate alignment software with the following parameters: model est2genome, geneseed 250, and bestn 1.19 The FL-cDNAs and short-read data were loaded into the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser,20 for visualization at the following address: http://shenlab.sols.unlv.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway.2.4. Short-read alignmentShort reads were aligned to MSU R7 via Bowtie version 2.1.0 and Tophat version 2.0.9 software and OLego.21 The maximum junction length was set to 50,000 nt. Default values were used for all other parameters. The short-read data for all of the samples were merged. Transcript assembly was then performed using Cufflinks version 2.0.2 on the composite data to generate GTF files. The mapped short reads and junctions were loaded into a MySQL database. Tiling Assembly queried the database to identify exons and genes.2.5. Sample size calculation for comparison of Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks genes with FL-cDNAThe minimum sample size (n), needed to ensure the genes identified by Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks coincided with FL-cDNAs, was calculated using the following equation: n=Nx[(N-1)E2+x]<U+2060>, where x=Zc1002r(100-r)<U+2060>;22N represents the total number of discrepant genes; E is the margin of error, which was set to 5%; the critical value Zc100 was set to 1.96 based on a 95% confidence level (c); and r was set to 60% since this value was the expected discrepancy rate contributed to alternative splicing.3. Results and discussion3.1. Short-read alignmentThe short-read data from our previous publication were used in this study since we obtained the data and can vouch for its quality.9 In addition, using the same data allowed for comparison between our previously published results and the results in this study. The short reads were aligned to MSU R7 using the latest available version of Bowtie and Tophat. Of the 157,773,782 reads, 151,492,182 reads (96.0%) were aligned to the rice genome. Of the reads that aligned, over 10% aligned to currently unannotated regions, indicating that there are potentially many unidentified novel genes in the rice genome, similar to what was found for the human genome.4Though the focus on this study is on transcript assembly rather than mapping, we compared Tophat with the splice-sensitive mapping tool OLego. Both programmes identified junctions that the other did not, indicating that neither programme was 100% accurate (Supplementary Fig. S5). Of the 158,314 junctions identified by OLego, 124,594 junctions (78.7%) matched identically with a junction identified by Tophat. Although OLego identified more junctions, most of the junctions uniquely identified by OLego (71.3%) were determined from a single read. Since nearly 80% of the OLego junctions matched identically with Tophat and most of the remaining were derived from a single read, we chose to keep within the Tuxedo suite software since Cufflinks was designed to work with Bowtie and Tophat. OLego may be used as an alternative mapping tool if so desired.3.2. Benchmark analysisTo determine the minimum level of read alignment required for reliable detection of transcripts, 80 highly expressed single-isoform genes with evenly distributed reads across the exons were inserted into a randomly generated test genome. A control sample containing about 40 million reads was aligned to the test genome and not a single read mapped. This demonstrated that the test genome was an ideal method for excluding noise. Single-isoform genes were used to simplify the problem of correctly identifying all exons, while also allowing us to accurately determine the baseline for exon detection. Four categories were used, containing 20 genes each: one exon, two exons, three exons, and four exons. Tophat was used to align RNA-seq data from the control sample to the genes. Prior to analysing its ability to identify exons at a specific expression level, Tiling Assembly was run on the data to ensure the genes were properly identified as single-isoform genes with the appropriate number of exons. The minimum expression level used by Tiling Assembly to detect exons for these experiments was set to 50 RPKE, based on our analysis in Section 3.3., which indicated that expression levels below this threshold led to the identification of noise reads as exons. To test the ability of Tiling Assembly to correctly identify the genes at specific expression levels, 1,000 reads were randomly selected from the pool of reads that aligned to each gene and run through Tiling Assembly. The number of randomly selected reads was incrementally reduced, and Tiling Assembly was run again. This process was repeated several times until 50 reads per gene were selected. To compare the performance of Tiling Assembly with a well-established assembly algorithm, the same procedure was performed using Cufflinks. The accuracy with which Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks identified the genes was determined using a point of first failure method, which assumed that the highest RPKE, where a gene was first misidentified, was the point where identification becomes unreliable. As can be seen in Fig. 2, at an expression level of 100 RPKE, both Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks were able to identify single-exon and multi-exon genes with an 85% or higher accuracy rate. At a read depth lower than 100 RPKE, the accuracy rate dropped dramatically for both Cufflinks and Tiling Assembly, though Cufflinks' accuracy declined at a slower rate. These data indicate that Cufflinks and Tiling Assembly can accurately identify gene transcripts at a read depth of 100 RPKE or greater. Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks show similar accuracy predicting known genes inserted in a random test genome. A random test genome containing 80 highly expressed, single-isoform genes was created. Four categories were used, containing 20 genes each: (A) one exon, (B) two exons, (C) three exons, and (D) four exons. The number of reads aligned to each gene was varied to determine the read depth at which each programme failed to accurately predict the genes.Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks show similar accuracy predicting known genes inserted in a random test genome.

The number of reads aligned to each gene was varied to determine the read depth at which each programme failed to accurately predict the genes.Cufflinks uses a parsimony algorithm to identify transcripts,23 using the smallest number of transcripts to explain all the reads. Thus, despite possible gaps in the reads, if the reads can be explained by a single transcript, Cufflinks assumes a single transcript. This assumption allows Cufflinks to correctly identify single-exon genes down to as low as 50 RPKE. The accuracy rates reported from the test genome favour Cufflinks; however, RNA-seq data in an actual genome would contain noise reads. These stray reads can cause Cufflinks to mistakenly identify them as individual genes or exons. In contrast, the set 50 RPKE cutoff utilized by Tiling Assembly for these experiments prevents such noise reads from being classified as genes.To determine the rate of false-positive gene identification, 100 genes were indiscriminately selected and inserted into another random test genome. Both Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks found at least one gene at each of the locations, however, both also erroneously identified extra genes. Cufflinks reported 125 genes, whereas Tiling Assembly identified 117 genes. Investigation of the 25 extra genes identified by Cufflinks revealed numerous causes for misidentification, including missing junctions, gaps, and false identification of genes in intronic regions (Supplementary Figs S6–S8). While Tiling Assembly also overestimated the number of genes for similar reasons, it did so at a lower rate than Cufflinks. The main cause of this difference was due to identification of genes in intronic regions by Cufflinks, whereas Tiling Assembly disregarded these as noise.Investigation on the ability of Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks to correctly identify exons in random test genomes revealed a trade-off between the two methods. While Cufflinks was better able to accurately identify genes in the test genome at expression levels lower than 100 RPKE, both programmes showed similar accuracy above 100 RPKE. Cufflinks was more likely to mistakenly identify intronic regions containing noise reads as genes, whereas Tiling Assembly's more conservative approach to exon identification decreased the identification of these false genes. Actual genomes contain many noise reads aligning on intronic and intergenic regions, in which case Tiling Assembly would identify fewer false-positive genes.3.3. Application of Tiling Assembly identified 40,491 genes expressed in rice aleurone cellsTo determine the gene identification capabilities of Tiling Assembly in an actual genome, Tiling Assembly was applied to rice aleurone short-read data composited from four samples and aligned to MSU R7. Prior to application of Tiling Assembly to the rice genome, it was necessary to determine the minimum gene expression required for accurate detection of exons. This was determined through analysis of several genes, with LOC_Os01g01010 used as a representative example. Tiling Assembly was run multiple times on these genes, with varied expression thresholds, to determine at what point the exons were accurately recognized. The threshold was incrementally reduced from 100 RPKE. At 50 RPKE, Tiling Assembly identified exons e3 and e4 of LOC_Os01g01010 (Supplementary Fig. S9); however, lower expression thresholds resulted in identification of false exons due to noise read alignment. A threshold of 50 RPKE was thus used to ensure accurate exon identification.Exons were identified from MSU R7 using several steps. First, identification of exons was achieved through analysis of overlapping reads aligning to the same region of the genome, with minimum expression of 50 RPKE required for these regions to be considered an exon. This step led to an initial identification of 207,908 potential exons.Identification of exons via tiling of read alignments limits the size of the exons found to the length of a single read. Tiling Assembly gets around this limitation via analysis of junction alignments produced by Tophat, as described in Section 2.1. In this second step of exon identification, an additional 1,397 potential exons were identified, bringing the total number to 209,305 potential exons.When a gene has low read coverage, there may be exons which contain gaps in read alignment. Since Tiling Assembly depends on overlapping reads to identify exons, such gaps lead to artificial fragmenting of exons. To avoid this issue, exons that were within 50 nt of each other, a space which could be closed by the length of a single read in our data set, were merged together. To determine whether this merging of exons was likely to result in erroneous merging of genes, the annotated genes in MSU R7 were investigated. It was found that only 0.36% of the non-overlapping annotated genes reside within 50 nt of one another, so linking exons 50 nt apart should not cause a significant misrepresentation of the number of genes obtained from the overall RNA-seq analysis. However, linking closely spaced exons together may result in false merging of exons of the same gene. Of the 209,305 potential exons found in our RNA-seq data, 50,895 fragments were within 50 nt of each other. After linking these closely spaced fragments together, there were 158,410 potential exons.To fix any exons that may have been mistakenly merged, either by noise or linking of exons, Tiling Assembly utilized the junction alignments produced by Tophat. Tiling Assembly searched for exons that contained a Tophat junction to identify any exons that may have been mistakenly merged. Our goal in this analysis with Tiling Assembly was to find the most common isoform of a gene where intron retention is a possibility. Thus, if the density of reads aligning on the Tophat junction was <50%, compared with those aligned to the adjacent regions, then the junction was considered to be an intron (Supplementary Fig. S10). This splitting of exons increased the total number of potential exons to 185,445 exons.Once the exons were identified, the Tophat junction alignments were used to join exons together to form transcripts. Occasionally, Tophat maps false junctions across large distances due to sequence similarities to the actual junction elsewhere in the genome. To avoid considering these false junctions, Tiling Assembly was set to disregard junctions that skipped exons and spanned distances greater than 50k nt. In addition, in our previous study,9 it was found that there were numerous areas of the genome where large numbers of reads mapped to small regions, often <140 nt in length, due to high sequence similarity to other highly expressed regions of the genome. Tiling Assembly was thus set to disregard potential genes that had <140 nt. After linking all of the exons together and removing these very small genes, 40,491 genes were identified, containing 136,164 exons. This number does not represent the entire rice genome because Tiling Assembly relies on transcriptome data for gene identification and not all genes are expected to be expressed in all tissues, such as aleurone.The genes found by Tiling Assembly were compared with the annotated genes in MSU R7. Of the 40,491 genes identified, 28,019 overlapped with an annotated gene by at least 75%, and 10,129 genes by <5% (Fig. 3). Thus, 94% of the genes identified by Tiling Assembly either corresponded well to an annotated gene or by a minimal amount. The 10,129 minimally overlapping genes were considered as potential novel genes. Genes identified by Tiling Assembly overlapped either well or minimally with annotated genes. The start and termination positions of genes identified by Tiling Assembly were compared with those of the MSU R7 genes to determine the amount of each Tiling Assembly gene corresponded with an MSU R7 gene. Of the 40,491 genes, 28,019 corresponded to an annotated gene by >75%, and 10,129 by <5%. This 5% category represents potential novel genes.Genes identified by Tiling Assembly overlapped either well or minimally with annotated genes.

This 5% category represents potential novel genes.The 2,343 Tiling Assembly genes that overlapped with an annotated gene between 5 and 75% may be the result of undiscovered alternatively spliced forms of known genes. Since these transcripts were identified using RNA-seq data from rice aleurone cells, a tissue that has not previously been used for gene identification, the presence of potential unannotated alternative splice variants of genes is not surprising.3.4. Application of Cufflinks identified 38,175 genes expressed in rice aleurone cellsTo compare the gene-finding capabilities of Tiling Assembly with a well-established assembly programme, Cufflinks was run on the same RNA-seq data. Of the 38,175 transcripts identified by Cufflinks, 32,969 overlapped with an MSU R7 annotation by at least 5%. The remaining 5,206 transcripts included multiple isoforms of the same genes. To reduce overrepresentation of the same gene, transcripts that were completely contained within another transcript were eliminated. This left 4,051 potential novel genes identified by Cufflinks. Of these, 48 genes were below the minimum 140 nt requirement used in this analysis and 18 genes were on unknown chromosomes. Therefore, 3,985 potential novel genes were identified by Cufflinks.3.5. Comparison of the novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly and CufflinksAmong the potential novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks, 1,316 genes were identified exclusively by Cufflinks, 7,460 by Tiling Assembly, and 2,669 by both (Fig. 4A). After eliminating potential novel genes with low expression, using 100 RPKE as a threshold for gene identification based on our benchmark analysis (Fig. 2), 4,690 genes were identified as potential novel genes. Of these, 3,473 genes were identified by Tiling Assembly, 52 by Cufflinks, and 1,166 by both (Fig. 4B). Tiling Assembly identified over 2.5 times more novel genes than Cufflinks. Novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks were compared to determine how much they overlapped. (A) When all novel genes were considered, 7,460 genes were exclusively identified by Tiling Assembly, 1,316 by Cufflinks, and 2,669 by both. (B) When only novel genes with high expression levels (=100 RPKE) were considered, 3,473 genes were exclusively identified by Tiling Assembly, 52 by Cufflinks, and 1,166 by both.Tiling Assembly identified over 2.5 times more novel genes than Cufflinks.

BLAST searches were used to eliminate potential novel genes with high sequence similarity to other genomic regions, resulting in 767 high-confidence, unannotated novel genesDuring read alignment, if a read can map to multiple locations within a genome, the read is randomly assigned to one of the locations.1,24 Because of this, potential novel genes that have a high similarity to another region in the rice genome may be false-positive genes. In addition, the rice genome contains a number of transcriptionally active gene fragments with high levels of sequence identity to annotated protein-coding genes and genes which may be involved in regulation of those genes rather than functioning as protein-coding genes themselves.25 BLAST26 searches revealed that 774 genes showed <25% sequence similarity to another region within the genome. Of these genes, seven genes had a footprint of <140 nt and were filtered out, bringing the total number of potential novel genes with <25% similarity to 767 genes (Fig. 5). These 767 genes were considered to be high-confidence novel genes based on the following criteria: they were unannotated, highly expressed, and contained relatively unique sequences (Supplementary Table S1). Of these high-confidence novel genes, 151 genes were uniquely identified by Tiling Assembly and 26 by Cufflinks. The remaining 590 genes were identified by both. Tiling Assembly was not only capable of finding 97% of the high-confidence novel genes found by Cufflinks, but it also found an additional 151 genes. Tiling Assembly identified more novel genes than Cufflinks regardless of similarity to another genomic region. BLAST searches determined the level of similarity of the potential novel genes to other regions of the rice genome.Tiling Assembly identified more novel genes than Cufflinks regardless of similarity to another genomic region. BLAST searches determined the level of similarity of the potential novel genes to other regions of the rice genome.3.7. Comparison to previously published resultsIn our previous publication, we identified 553 novel genes using a combination of Cufflinks and a custom Clustering Algorithm.9 Clustering Algorithm was developed to identify novel genes based on the presence of reads aligning to unannotated regions of the rice genome. Comparing the 767 potential novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks with the 553 novel genes identified in our previous publication, there were 461 genes that coincided (Fig. 6A). There were 306 genes that were not identified in our previous publication. These additional 306 genes demonstrate that our new pipeline is superior to that previously reported. Comparison of Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks identified potential novel genes with those published in our previous study. (A) There were 92 genes identified in our previous study that were not classified as novel genes by Tiling Assembly or Cufflinks. While all of them were identified by Tiling Assembly or Cufflinks, slight changes in their length disqualified them from fitting into the category of potential novel genes. Of the 767 unannotated genes identified in this study, 306 genes were not identified in our previous study, demonstrating that our new pipeline is superior to that previously reported. (B) While all of the Clustering Algorithm genes were also found by Tiling Assembly, slight changes in their identification disqualified five from fitting into the category of potential novel genes.Comparison of Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks identified potential novel genes with those published in our previous study.

Most of these 92 genes were identified by Tiling Assembly in the initial steps but, due to slight differences in gene length, were filtered out as a result of low RPKE, high similarity to another region of the genome or overlap with an annotated gene. In addition, an older version of the rice genome and older versions of Cufflinks, Tophat, and Bowtie was used to identify genes in our previous publication. These factors resulted in a difference in the number of genes identified by Cufflinks in our previous publication, when compared with those reported in this study.Of the 553 genes identified in our previous study, 124 were identified by Clustering Algorithm. These Clustering Algorithm genes were compared with Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks to determine the efficiencies of the algorithms (Fig. 6B). Of the Clustering Algorithm genes, 112 genes were found by both Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks. There were five Clustering Algorithm genes that were not identified by Tiling Assembly or Cufflinks.Upon closer inspection of these five genes, it appeared Tiling Assembly correctly identified genes within the same location; however, there were differences in how the genes were identified. Two genes identified by Clustering Algorithm were associated with previously annotated genes by Tiling Assembly and were not considered novel genes. One Clustering Algorithm gene was identified as two genes by Tiling Assembly, each of which was eliminated as a potential novel gene based on similarity to another genomic region. Slight differences in the boundaries of the remaining two genes, as identified by Tiling Assembly, resulted in shorter genes. This resulted in an increased percent similarity to another genomic region, thus eliminating them as potential novel genes. Though these five genes may be potential novel genes, they do not satisfy our requirements for consideration as high-confidence potential novel genes.3.8. Open reading frame identificationMany regions of the genome are actively transcribed, but do not produce protein products. To determine whether Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks identified novel protein-coding genes, the introns were removed and the longest possible open reading frame (ORF) associated with each of the 767 potential novel genes was determined. The predicted peptide lengths ranged from 23 to 4,737 codons. The average ORF length was 155 codons and more than half of the genes were 80–160 codons in length (Fig. 7). Since random DNA sequences are statistically unlikely to be more than 50 codons long without containing a stop codon,27 the fact that most of the ORFs found code for longer sequences indicates that they are likely protein-coding genes. Though proteins as small as 20 amino acids have been discovered in other organisms, they are uncommon,28 and no ORFs with fewer than 23 codons were found in our data set. Only 14 novel genes (1.8%) had predicted ORFs <40 codons and are probably not protein-coding genes. These genes may encode micro-RNAs or other non-coding RNAs.28,29 In addition, during the development of MSU R7, a 50 codon threshold was used. These data indicate that the majority of high-confidence novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks are likely protein-coding genes, and it is not likely that they are genes that merely failed to meet the MSU R7 50 codon threshold. The peptide length distribution of potential novel genes is similar to that of annotated genes. The longest ORF was determined for each of the genes using an internally developed programme. The ORFs ranged from 23 to 4,737 codons in length, with an average length of 155 codons.The peptide length distribution of potential novel genes is similar to that of annotated genes. The longest ORF was determined for each of the genes using an internally developed programme. The ORFs ranged from 23 to 4,737 codons in length, with an average length of 155 codons.The 767 potential novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly were further analysed by performing a protein BLAST on each gene to determine whether they exhibited any sequence homology to known proteins. There were 641 genes that showed some level of sequence homology, with 99 genes having an E-value =0.0001. Of these, 97 genes were homologous to predicted proteins, one to a hypothetical protein, and one to a bacterial heat-shock protein. The remaining 126 genes did not exhibit any sequence homology to known proteins. These genes may encode lincRNAs, or other long non-coding RNAs.293.9. Comparing Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks genes to FL-cDNAsMSU R7 compiles annotation data from multiple sources, including FL-cDNA sequences, ESTs, and gene prediction software.13 As such, many of the annotated genes are hypothetical and not known to be expressed. To further evaluate the accuracy of Tiling Assembly in the identification of expressed genes, the genes identified by Tiling Assembly were compared with over 28,000 published FL-cDNAs, collected and sequenced by Kikuchi et al.18 These FL-cDNAs represent mRNA transcripts obtained from the rice plant and are thus more reliable than the computationally predicted transcripts in MSU R7. Of the 26,302 genes identified by Tiling Assembly with an expression level of at least 100 RPKE, 7,104 overlapped with a published FL-cDNA by >90% of their sequences. If multiple FL-cDNA variants overlapped with the same Tiling Assembly gene, the FL-cDNA variant with the same number of exons as the Tiling Assembly gene was selected for comparison. There were 5,767 genes that matched in exon number with their corresponding FL-cDNAs. The remaining 1,337 genes (18.8%) are here referred to as discrepant genes. To determine the source of these discrepancies between Tiling Assembly and the FL-cDNA, seven different categories of classification were used: extra exon, missing exon, extra intron, missing intron, missing junction, gap, or multiple discrepancies. In the instance Tiling Assembly recognized an exon where the corresponding FL-cDNA did not, the discrepancy was categorized as an extra exon (Supplementary Fig. S11A). In the instance Tiling Assembly did not identify an exon where the corresponding FL-cDNA did, it was categorized as a missing exon (Supplementary Fig. S11B). In the instance Tiling Assembly recognized an intron within the corresponding exon of the FL-cDNA, it was categorized as an extra intron (Supplementary Fig. S11C). In the instance Tiling Assembly recognized a single exon where the corresponding FL-cDNA recognized two exons, it was categorized to be a missing intron (Supplementary Fig. S11D).The analysis was also performed on the Cufflinks genes. Of the 26,876 genes identified by Cufflinks that had an expression level of at least 100 RPKE, 7,690 overlapped with a published FL-cDNA by >90% of their sequences. Of these, 5,970 genes matched in exon number with their corresponding FL-cDNA and the remaining 1,720 genes (22.4%) were considered discrepant genes. Though Cufflinks identified more matching genes, the percentage and the number of discrepant genes were greater than Tiling Assembly.Because it is time-consuming to analyse the causes of discrepancies for the 1,337 Tiling Assembly genes and the 1,720 Cufflinks genes, a portion of the gene pool was sampled for detailed analysis. The appropriate sample size for this comparison was calculated to be 290 genes, based on a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error (see Section 2.5.), and was rounded up to 300 genes. FL-cDNAs that had both a corresponding Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks gene that were discrepant were chosen for manual analysis. If a gene exhibited numerous reads, but showed a difference in the number of exons between the two data sets, alternative splicing was considered a possible cause. More than 60% of multi-exonic genes in plants are alternatively spliced,30 with intron retention being the most common form of alternative splicing.31 It is unlikely that the FL-cDNA dataset18 contains all alternative splice variants of transcripts. In addition, Tiling Assembly was designed to identify a single splice variant. Therefore, it was expected that the majority of the discrepancies may be due to alternative splicing. Indeed, of the 300 discrepant Tiling Assembly genes analysed, 96.7% could be attributed to alternative splicing. Extra or missing introns were the most abundant cause of the discrepancy as would be expected for plants. The remaining 3.3% were attributed to missing junctions or gaps (Fig. 8). Similar results were obtained for the Cufflinks dataset, with 96.3% due to possible alternative splicing and the remaining 3.7% attributed to missing junctions or gaps. The major cause of discrepancies between Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks and their corresponding FL-cDNAs were due to extra or missing introns. A sample of 300 FL-cDNAs that had both corresponding Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks transcripts were analysed to determine the major causes of discrepancies. Extra intron and missing intron were the major causes of discrepancies for both Cufflinks and Tiling Assembly. Of the Tiling Assembly transcripts, 96.7% of the discrepancies may be due to alternative splicing that resulted in extra introns, missing introns, extra exons, missing exons, or multiple discrepancies (shown in brackets in the above image). Of the Cufflinks transcripts, 96.3% of the discrepancies may be due to alternative splicing.The major cause of discrepancies between Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks and their corresponding FL-cDNAs were due to extra or missing introns.

Of the Cufflinks transcripts, 96.3% of the discrepancies may be due to alternative splicing.Applying the results from the sample of 300 discrepant Tiling Assembly genes, out of the 1,337 discrepant genes, it was expected that about 1,293 discrepancies (96.7%) may be due to alternative splicing events. The remaining 44 genes (3.3%) were expected to be the result of missing junctions, gaps, or other discrepancies. These 44 genes represented 0.6% of the 7,104 genes that overlapped with the FL-cDNAs. Therefore, it was expected that Tiling Assembly may be as high as 99.4% accurate in the identification of genes with at least 90% overlap.Appling the results from the sample of 300 discrepant Cufflinks genes, out of the 1,720 discrepant genes, it was expected that 1,656 discrepancies were possible alternative splicing events. The remaining 64 genes were expected to be the result of missing junctions, gaps, or other discrepancies. These 64 genes represented 0.8% of the 7,690 genes that overlapped with the FL-cDNAs. Therefore, it was expected that Cufflinks may be as high as 99.2% accurate in the identification of genes with at least 90% overlap.3.10. Identification of transcription start and termination sites by Tiling AssemblyThe transcription start and termination sites were compared between genes identified by Tiling Assembly with those identified by the FL-cDNAs (Fig. 9). Only Tiling Assembly genes that overlapped with an FL-cDNA by at least 90% were considered. Of the 7,174 transcription start sites that satisfied the specified overlap threshold, ~83% differed by =100 nt (Fig. 9A). The transcription start sites predicted by Tiling Assembly were on average 30 nt upstream of the FL-cDNAs. These data demonstrated that Tiling Assembly is a reasonably reliable tool for the identification of transcription start sites. Nucleotide differences between transcriptional start (A) and termination (B) sites of FL-cDNAs and Tiling Assembly genes. The transcriptional start and termination sites were compared with those of FL-cDNAs previously published. The distribution of the difference between the Tiling Assembly and FL-cDNA start and stop sites is presented here. A negative value indicates that the Tiling Assembly gene is shorter than the FL-cDNA and a positive value indicates that the Tiling Assembly gene is longer.Nucleotide differences between transcriptional start (A) and termination (B) sites of FL-cDNAs and Tiling Assembly genes.

The transcription termination sites predicted by Tiling Assembly were on average 71 nt downstream of the FL-cDNAs. These data demonstrate that Tiling Assembly is less reliable at predicting the transcription termination sites. Overall, Tiling Assembly overestimated the length of the transcripts. This overestimation may be due to noise reads near the start and termination sites. Alternatively, past research has indicated that termination sites are variable.32 Hence, the accuracy rates of Tiling Assembly in predicting transcription termination sites may be underestimated.3.11. Application of Tiling Assembly to the genomes of model organismsHaving demonstrated the effect of Tiling Assembly on detecting novel genes in rice, its performance was evaluated on other model organisms. Loraine et al.33 discovered 5,312 transcriptionally active regions (TARs) in the unannotated regions of the A. thaliana genome; however, few filters were used to remove false-positive TARs. For instance, of the 5,312 TARs reported, 3,490 were the length of a single read (75 nt). However, this large number of TARs indicated that there may still be undiscovered genes in Arabidopsis. Using the same Tiling Assembly parameters used for identifying potential novel genes in O. sativa, 218 potential novel genes were identified in Arabidopsis, representing nearly 1% of all annotated genes. Of these 218 potential novel genes, 99 genes (45%) contained at least part of one or more TARs, and 35 genes (16%) had at least one TAR completely contained within the gene. It is likely that most of the TARs reported by Lorraine et al. did not correlate with a Tiling Assembly novel gene because the majority of them were identified based on individual reads. These individual reads may have resulted from genomic DNA contamination or noise caused by statistical mapping error.To determine whether the ability of Tiling Assembly to find large numbers of unannotated genes was applicable to non-plant species, the algorithm was applied to several additional model organisms (Table 1). Surprisingly, 458 novel genes were identified in S. cerevisiae, representing almost 7% of the known genes. Even though this model organism has been more intensively studied than Arabidopsis, this large number of potential novel genes may be due to the fact that only a single RNA-seq replicate was used in this study. Similar analysis was performed on D. melanogaster and C. elegans. The number of potential novel genes identified in each of these additional organisms may be improved by using parameters specific to the organism. Potential novel genes identified in other organisms by Tiling AssemblyRNA-seq data downloaded from the SRA were used to investigate the ability of Tiling Assembly to find unannotated genes in additional model organisms. For each of the organisms, the same criteria were used for identifying potential novel genes as those used for rice.Ch: number of chromosomes; GS: genome size; Annot. genes: annotated genes.Potential novel genes identified in other organisms by Tiling AssemblyRNA-seq data downloaded from the SRA were used to investigate the ability of Tiling Assembly to find unannotated genes in additional model organisms.

DiscussionThere are relatively few publicly available transcript assembly programmes despite the vast increase in the use of RNA-seq. In this study, a novel assembly algorithm, Tiling Assembly, was developed to address the lack of established algorithms to identify transcribed regions as genes. This algorithm was compared with the Cufflinks transcript assembly software to evaluate its gene-finding capabilities in relation to established assembly software (Table 2). It was concluded that Tiling Assembly found substantially more genes and found a lower number of false-positive genes, though Cufflinks ran somewhat faster and was able to identify multiple transcripts for a given gene. It was also determined that Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks had similar accuracy at predicting single and multi-exonic genes down to 100 RPKE (Fig. 2). When the Tiling Assembly genes were compared to FL-cDNAs, the vast majority of discrepancies could be attributed to alternative splicing. Excluding those genes, Tiling Assembly appeared to be as high as 99.4% accurate in identification of genes.

No filtering performed.cExcludes set-up time. Set-up for Tiling Assembly and Cufflinks is about the same time.Before applying filters for potential novel genes, 28,019 genes that overlapped at least 75% with an annotated gene (Fig. 3) were found from the RNA-seq data using Tiling Assembly. MSU R7 annotation contains 55,986 genes, which would seem to imply that half the annotated genes in the rice genome were expressed in the aleurone cells. In our previous publication, we reported that 18,152 annotated genes were expressed in the aleurone cells.9 The criteria used for expression in our previous publication required an expression level of at least 1.0 read per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM), which is equivalent to ~150 RPKE for this data. At 150 RPKE, Tiling Assembly identified 17,971 annotated genes, which were in line with our previous publication. Since 100 RPKE was determined as the minimum expression for gene detection, Tiling Assembly identified 20,230 expressed annotated genes in rice aleurone.Comparison of the novel genes identified by Tiling Assembly with Cufflinks shows that Tiling Assembly identifies up to 74% more genes than Cufflinks (Fig. 4). After eliminating genes that showed high similarity to another genomic region, the Tiling Assembly identified 151 more novel genes than Cufflinks (Fig. 5). We analysed the data to determine possible causes for the large discrepancy in genes identified between the two programmes. One possible reason for this discrepancy was that Tiling Assembly was calling regions that were highly similar to another region, whereas Cufflinks disregarded them. BLAST search filters revealed that this was not the case. Another possible reason was that Cufflinks and Tiling Assembly found a gene within the same region, but the start and stop locations of those genes were different. Investigation of the positional overlap of the high-confidence novel genes found by each of the programmes verified that those genes unique to each programme did not overlap. A final possibility considered was that some novel genes detected by Cufflinks were longer than the corresponding Tiling Assembly gene and thus overlapped with an adjacent annotated gene. This overlap eliminated the Cufflinks gene as a potential novel gene. Analysis showed that there were 101 Cufflinks genes that overlapped with an annotated gene. These occurrences were attributed to two causes; the Cufflinks gene included regions with low read depth, which were considered noise reads by Tiling Assembly, or Cufflinks exons were merged based on junction alignments that were disregarded by Tiling Assembly because they were very long and skipped exons. In five cases, one of these long junctions skipped over an expressed region, which was called a novel gene by Tiling Assembly but an intron by Cufflinks. In 19 additional cases, these long junction alignments led to extremely long genes identified by Cufflinks which spanned multiple MSU R7 annotated and Tiling Assembly genes. There were nine expressed regions detected as a gene by Tiling Assembly where there was no corresponding Cufflinks gene, for unknown reasons.Tiling Assembly is a heuristic, ab initio transcript assembly algorithm, which uses a read tiling approach to identify transcripts. Unlike de novo assembly algorithms such as Trinity,5 Tiling Assembly takes advantage of a sequenced genome to improve the accuracy of transcript assembly while decreasing CPU requirements. Tiling Assembly does not require an annotated genome, so it may be used for organisms where the genome is sequenced but the annotation is naive. Many of the current transcript assembly algorithms attempt to reproduce each of the isoforms available to a gene using a bipartite graph approach, which can lead to reporting of statistically probable, but non-real isoforms and dilution of expression levels of real isoforms as reads are assigned to the non-real isoforms. Tiling Assembly instead produces the longest possible isoform of a gene. Comparison of Tiling Assembly with a well-established transcript assembly programme, Cufflinks, revealed that Tiling Assembly's strengths lie in the accurate prediction of exons in the presence of noise and improved discovery of high-confidence novel genes.In conclusion, we describe a heuristic approach to novel gene identification. Using this approach in combination with Cufflinks, 767 high-confidence unannotated genes were identified in rice. These genes contained predicted ORFs ranging from 40 to over 4,000 codons, with the majority showing sequence homology to known and predicted proteins. The accuracy of the genes identified by Tiling Assembly was validated through comparison with their corresponding FL-cDNAs, which implied Tiling Assembly may be as accurate as 99.4%. Tiling Assembly accurately predicted the transcription start sites to within 100 nt of the corresponding FL-cDNA, but was less accurate at predicting the transcription termination sites. Application of Tiling Assembly on A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae identified hundreds of high-confidence novel genes, demonstrating that even in the most well-studied model organisms there are still undiscovered genes. This pipeline proves to be an effective way to identify novel genes in a diverse array of organisms. The novel genes identified here should be further studied to determine their functions and roles in their organisms.4.

IntroductionInborn deviations from the normal diploid cohort of 46 chromosomes, ‘aneuploidy’, causes severe problems in human development, growth, and function.1–3 Aneuploidy is caused by errors in chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis,2 and is frequently found in cancer cells.1,4 The most common aneuploidy sustained in live births is trisomy 21—three copies of chromosome 21 resulting in Down syndrome (DS).5,6 This complex developmental disorder involves congenital heart defects, haematopoietic disorders, early-onset Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and premature ageing, including telomeres shorter than those of age-matched people without DS.6–9Although aneuploidy has conventionally been deemed irremediable, some researchers have recently aimed to develop ‘chromosome therapy’ for DS.10,11 One group has eliminated one copy of chromosome 21 by inserting a TK-NEO marker that can be selected against,11 and another has inactivated one copy of chromosome 21 by inserting into it a copy of the XIST gene that normally inactivates one of the two X chromosomes in female cells.10 These procedures have thus provided proof of principle, but have not been applied to non-immortalized primary cells due to their requirement of elaborate and cumbersome multistep genetic engineering. These limitations could be partially overcome by modifying induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from people with DS,12 but comparable culture and genetic manipulation before therapeutic intervention would still be required.10,11 A comparable limitation exists for a similar approach in which spontaneous correction of ring chromosomes occurs during the generation of human iPS cells from an individual with Miller–Dieker syndrome.13In contrast to these complex protocols, an ideal procedure would correct aneuploidy by simply treating cells directly with small molecules or biologics that would leave no genetic alteration or footprint in cells and would thus make the intervention more tractable.We have taken the first steps towards such a procedure based on the use of a mammalian-specific gene, Zscan4 (zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4). We originally identified the gene as one expressed specifically at the 2-cell stage of mouse preimplantation embryos.14 We further showed that mouse Zscan4 is infrequently expressed in undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, resulting in 1–5% of Zscan4-positive (Zscan4+) cells in culture at a given time.14,15 Mouse Zscan4 is also required for genome stability and maintenance of a normal karyotype in mouse ES cells.15 The forced expression of Zscan4 extends telomeres rapidly within a few days by a telomerase-independent recombination mechanism.15 Intriguingly, we found that forced transient expression of mouse Zscan4 (i.e. for a day) from a doxycycline-inducible transgene improves karyotypes and developmental potential, which otherwise characteristically deteriorate during the long-term culture of mouse ES cells.16 These observations suggested that Zscan4 might have potential therapeutic applications, though findings with mouse Zscan4 in mouse models might not be translatable to humans. The human equivalent, ZSCAN4, was also known to have a unique expression pattern,17,18 but had not been further characterized. In particular, it was not known whether it could function in differentiated somatic cells that are the putative target of therapies. For example, somatic cells might lack partner proteins that are present in ES cells and preimplantation embryos. Also, all the previous work had used a mouse Zscan4-transgene integrated into the genome, a scenario very different from the goal of accomplishing human ZSCAN4 function without requiring complicated genetic engineering of cells.Here, we report the development of novel biologics—synthetic mRNAs and Sendai virus vectors encoding human ZSCAN4—which can efficiently increase cells with normal karyotypes in mouse ES cells as well as in non-immortalized primary human fibroblast cells derived from people with DS or Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18).19 These results motivate further work to test possible applications of ZSCAN4 biologics to treat chromosome abnormalities.2. Materials and methods2.1. Development of ZSCAN4 biologicsFrom the perspective of developing therapeutics, it is desirable to overexpress ZSCAN4 without stably integrating an exogenous transgene DNA into the cells, which could cause insertion-based mutations. Because Zscan4 is only required transiently, we decided to test the direct delivery of mRNAs into the cells, which are translated into proteins. We chose two mRNA delivery methods: Synthetic mRNAs (Syn-mRNAs) and Sendai virus (SeV) vectors.For the synthesis of modified mRNA, mRNA synthesis was performed as reported previously.20 In brief, mRNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription of template DNAs encoding mouse Zscan4c, human ZSCAN4, or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) with modified mixtures of dNTP to increase RNA stability as well as translation efficiency in mammalian cells.For SeV vectors, we used a non-transmissible vector that lacks the F protein.21 Although wild-type SeV is known for its function of causing cell fusions, the SeV vectors used here lack the capacity for cell fusion.21 Temperature-sensitive variants of non-transmissible SeV vectors (SeV18/<U+0394>F-TS7 and SeV18/<U+0394>F-TS15),22 which express mouse Zscan4c, human ZSCAN4, or a green fluorescent protein variant—Azami-Green (AG, a control), were custom-made (DNAVEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Japan). It has been shown that SeV-TS7 is functional at 35°C and weakly functional at 37°C, but not at the non-permissive temperature of 38°C or 39°C, whereas SeV-TS15 is functional at 35°C, but not at 37°C, though their temperature-profiles are slightly different.222.2. Mouse ES cellsWe used a previously established mouse ES cell line, MC1ZE16, which was cultured in the standard condition.16 In brief, the cells were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2 in complete ES medium: DMEM (Invitrogen), 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies), 1000 U ml-1 leukaemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 0.1 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin/streptomycin (50 U/50 mg ml-1). The medium was changed daily.2.3. Primary fibroblast cells derived from people with DS and Edwards syndromeFibroblast cells isolated from four individuals with DS (Trisomy 21) were purchased from the Coriell Cell Repository (NJ, USA). Their catalogue numbers were AG05397 (47,XY,+21), AG08942 (47,XY,+21), AG05024 (47,XX,+21), and AG06872 (47,XX,+21). Fibroblast cells isolated from an individual with Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18) were also purchased from the Coriell Cell Repository (NJ, USA). Their catalogue number was AG12614 (47,XX,+18). All of these fibroblast cells were non-immortalized primary fibroblast cells. All of these anonymized cells were used according to the guidelines provided by the Coriell Cell Repository. These cells were cultured in the standard culture condition as instructed by the Coriell Cell Repository.2.4. Transfection of mouse ES cells with Syn-mRNAsFive to 6 h before transfection, 2 × 105 cells per well were plated in a 6-well plate. Transfection was performed using 1 µg of Syn-mRNA and 5 µl of RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.5. Infection of mouse ES cells with SeV vectorsMouse ES cells were plated on a gelatin-coated 6-well plate and then infected with either SeV-mZscan4-TS15 or SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25. Then they were cultured at 35°C for 3 days, and then transferred to 37°C. Cells were passaged on days 2 and 4. The MOI of 25 was determined after optimizing the SeV doses on mouse ES cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).2.6. Transfection of human fibroblast cells with Syn-mRNAsHuman non-immortalized primary fibroblast cells (5 × 104cells/well) were plated in a 6-well plate and then transfected with 1 µg of Syn-mRNAs (Syn-hZSCAN4 or Syn-GFP) using 5 µl of Lipofectamine (RNAiMax: Life Technologies, CA, USA). In addition to cells transfected with a Syn-GFP, non-transfected cells were also used as a control. The dose of Syn-mRNAs (i.e. 1 µg for 5 × 104cells/well in a 6-well plate) was determined after optimization (Supplementary Fig. S2).2.7. Infection of human fibroblast cells with SeV vectorsFibroblast cells were plated in a 6-well plate (5 × 104cells/well) and immediately treated with the SeV vectors described above at an MOI of 25 (day 0). Medium was changed next day to remove the remaining SeV vectors (day 1). Cells were kept at 35°C for 7 days then transferred to 37°C (day 7). On day 7, the production of protein was monitored either by fluorescence microscopy for SeV-AG or by immunostaining for SeV-hZSCAN4. Infected cells were subcultured continuously. In the third week of treatment (on day 21, 23, or 24), the number of chromosome 21 was counted by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The MOI of 25 was determined after optimizing the SeV doses on human fibroblast cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).2.8. Chromosome FISHWe used a chromosome 21-specific probe (CHR21-10-GR) and a chromosome 18-specific probe (CHR18-10-GR) purchased from Empire Genomics (Buffalo, NY, USA). CHR21-10-GR hybridized to the centromeric region long-arm band 21q21.1 and CHR18-10-GR hybridized to the short-arm band 18p11. Chromosome FISH was carried out according to the manufacture's protocol. In brief, cells were attached to a glass slide, which was treated with pre-warmed denaturation buffer at 73°C for 5 min and placed in 70, 85, and 100% ethanol at room temperature for 1 min serially. Before hybridization, probes were denatured at 73°C for 5 min and placed at 37°C for 15 min, then applied to the slides, which were then incubated at 37°C for 16 h for hybridization. After washing, slides were visualized under a microscope using the appropriate fluorescent filter set.2.9. Karyotype analyses of mouse ES cellsMouse ES cells were treated with 0.1 µg/ml Colcemid (Gibco) for 3 h to enrich metaphase cells, and then the cells were exposed to 0.56% KCl for 10 min and fixed by 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid. Slides were stained with Giemsa stain before observations.2.10. Karyotype analyses of human cellsHigh-resolution G-banded karyotyping was carried out in a blinded manner by Cell Line Genetics, Inc. (Madison, WI, USA). Live cell cultures were sent to Cell Line Genetics, Inc. and the chromosome analyses of 40 cells per sample were requested. Comprehensive interpretation of results was provided by their scientist and the reports were signed by a clinically certified cytogeneticist. The service complies with FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP).2.11. Measurement of telomere lengthGenomic DNAs were extracted by using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and quantified by Nanodrop. Telomere length was measured by a quantitative real-time PCR method described previously.23 In brief, qRT–PCR was performed on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) by using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). For telomere PCR, 50 nM Tel1 (5'-GGTTTTTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGT-3') and 300 nM Tel2 (5'-TCCCGACTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTA-3') were used. For a single copy gene (36B4) PCR, 300 nM 36B4u (5'-CAGCAAGTGGGAAGGTGTAATCC-3') and 500 nM 36B4d (5'-CCCATTCTATCATCAACGGGTACAA-3') were used. For both PCR amplifications, the conditions were 95°C incubation for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C 15 s, and 58°C 1 min. Standard curves were produced by the serial dilution of reference DNAs from 100 to 3.125 ng. A relative T/S ratio (Telomere/Single copy gene) was generated to indicate the relative telomere length for each sample.2.12. Quantitative RT–PCRTotal RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). For cDNA synthesis, 2.5 µg of total RNAs was reverse transcribed using random 6-mer primers by PrimeScript 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR analysis was performed using 50 ng of cDNAs per well in triplicate with SYBR green PCR master mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used: hZSCAN4 5'-UTR (forward, 5'-ACCAAGGAGCTTGCAGTTT-3'; reverse, 5'-TTCAGTCTCTTGCCTTGTGTC-3'); Tmem92 (forward, 5'-CCTGCTTTCCAGTCTCCAAG-3'; reverse, 5'-TGACCAAGAACCTAAAGCGG-3'). Reactions were performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). Fold induction was calculated by the <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method.2.13. ImmunohistochemistryCells were plated on sterilized cover slides placed in 12-well plates. The cover slides were taken out from the plate, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking in 10% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton-X for 30 min, cells were incubated with mouse anti-human ZSCAN4 antibodies (Sigma: catalogue number: SAB1400842) at dilution of 1:1000 for 30 min and then incubated with Alexa 555 goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Nuclei were visualized with DAPI staining.2.14. Whole-exome sequencing analysesGenome-wide exome sequencing was carried out in a blinded manner by a commercial sequencing service (Empire Genomics, LLC). In brief, genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Gentra PureGene Blood Core Kit B. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA using the AgilentSureSelectXT Human All Exon V4 kit. Paired-end 100 bp read lengths were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 next-generation sequencer to achieve 50-fold coverage per sample. Resultant FastQ files were processed in the standard manner (http://seqanswers.com/wiki/How-to/exome_analysis). In brief, sequences were aligned to the human genome (hg19) and generated SAI files were converted to SAM files by the BWA tool.24 The SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted by Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net). PCR duplicates were marked by Picard. Local realignment around indels was carried out by the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK).25 The mate information for the paired end data was fixed by Picard. Quality score recalibration was carried out by the GATK. Raw SNP calls were generated and filtered by the GATK. The resultant VCF files were viewed and analysed by VarSifter.26 Also, VCF files and BAM files were viewed and analysed by the IGV.27The following are indicators of quality and quantity of sequences generated from three samples—non-treated control cells, SeV-AG-treated control cells, and SeV-hZSCAN4-treated cells. These alignment summary reports were generated by a ‘flagstat’ command of SAMtools28 (Version 0.1.19-44428cd).Non-treated control cells:

To detect the changes of chromosome numbers in the cells, we used ‘AlleleBalance’—variant annotations provided by the GATK tool.25 AlleleBalance (AB) was calculated based on the read depth of a reference allele (REF) and an alternative allele (ALT): homozygous ‘ABHom’ was obtained by dividing the number of ALT alleles by the total number of alleles; heterozygous ‘ABHet’ was obtained by dividing the number of REF alleles by the total number of alleles. In theory, the value of the ABHom should be close to 1.00 for homozygous alleles and the value of the ABHet should be close to 0.5 for heterozygous alleles.51 862 788 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)0 + 0 duplicates51 473 127 + 0 mapped (99.25%:-nan%)51 862 788 + 0 paired in sequencing25 931 394 + 0 read1 --> Number of tags in paired end 125 931 394 + 0 read2 --> Number of tags in paired end 250 909 452 + 0 properly paired (98.16%:-nan%)51 384 595 + 0 with itself and mate mapped88 532 + 0 singletons (0.17%:-nan%)267 151 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr256 545 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ = 5)66 090 080 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)0 + 0 duplicates64 741 280 + 0 mapped (97.96%:-nan%)66 090 080 + 0 paired in sequencing33 045 040 + 0 read1 --> Number of tags in paired end 133 045 040 + 0 read2 --> Number of tags in paired end 264 116 010 + 0 properly paired (97.01%:-nan%)64 615 277 + 0 with itself and mate mapped126 003 + 0 singletons (0.19%:-nan%)288 571 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr276 632 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ = 5)49 978 930 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads)0 + 0 duplicates49 615 372 + 0 mapped (99.27%:-nan%)49 978 930 + 0 paired in sequencing24 989 465 + 0 read1 --> Number of tags in paired end 124 989 465 + 0 read2 --> Number of tags in paired end 249 113 676 + 0 properly paired (98.27%:-nan%)49 532 552 + 0 with itself and mate mapped82 820 + 0 singletons (0.17%:-nan%)242 624 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr233 078 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ = 5)To analyse the AlleleBalance, all of the information from the VCF files was extracted into Microsoft Excel format. Because it is known that sequence coverage will not be uniform on all the exons, we only analysed the common variant alleles that were detected in three samples. We also filtered out low-quality sequences and variants with low sequence coverage. Because the GATK does not provide ABHom and ABHet calculation for INDELs, we also filtered out INDELs. We then removed homozygous alleles (ABHom >0.5: for almost all of them, ABHom >0.95). ABHet scores of the remaining alleles were used to generate histograms for all of the chromosomes separately.According to the guidelines of the provider of cells (The Coriell Cell Repository), sequences obtained from donor-derived cells cannot be deposited into the public database to protect the donors’ privacy. Therefore, we will provide the sequence data to researchers upon request on the condition that the data will be handled according to the same strict guidelines.3. Results3.1. ZSCAN4 biologics improve karyotype in mouse ES cellsIn order to create an integration-free and footprint-free method to express a Zscan4 gene ectopically, we developed synthetic mRNAs (Syn-mRNAs). Syn-mRNAs are not converted to DNAs, and thus cannot integrate into the host genome.20,29 The production of protein from Syn-mRNAs peaks ~12 h after transfection and then declines precipitously20 (see Materials and methods for further details). We treated mouse ES cells once with either Syn-hZSCAN4 or Syn-GFP (control), and harvested the cells 4 days later for karyotype analyses (Fig. 1A). Representative images of abnormal and normal karyotypes are shown in Fig. 1B. This mouse ES cell line was used because of its relatively low percentage of euploid cells after long-term cell culture.16 Non-treated control cells showed only ~18% euploidy (Fig. 1C).16 Strikingly, the one-shot treatment of the cells with Syn-hZSCAN4 rapidly increased the percentage of euploid cells to 29%, whereas the treatment of cells with a control Syn-GFP did not change the percentage of euploidy (Fig. 1C). qRT–PCR analyses showed that marker genes known to be up-regulated by the overexpression of Zscan415,16 were also up-regulated in the Syn-hZSCAN4-treated cells (Fig. 1D). This confirmed that Zscan4 products indeed functioned in a manner similar to a Zscan4-transgene studied in a previous work.16Analyses of mouse ES cells treated with synthetic mRNAs encoding human ZSCAN4.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.As an independent method for footprint-free delivery of Zscan4 products, we used a Sendai virus (SeV) vector. SeV vectors are based on a single-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxovirus subfamily that completes its infection cycle as RNA (i.e. without involvement of DNAs). Therefore, a recombinant gene of interest transduced by SeV vector will not be integrated into the host genome. SeV vectors have been judged safe for human treatment, and several ongoing clinical trials utilize a SeV vector to deliver RNAs to cells.30–32 More specifically, we used non-transmissible SeV vectors (SeV18/<U+0394>F)21 and their temperature-sensitive variants (SeV18/<U+0394>F-TS15),22 which express mouse Zscan4 (SeV-mZscan4-TS15), human ZSCAN4 (SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15), or the Azami-Green green fluorescent protein variant (SeV-AG-TS15, a control) (see details in Materials and methods).We applied SeV-TS15 to mouse ES cells, incubated them at the permissive temperature of 35°C for 3 days and then at the non-permissive temperature of 37°C for 3 days before karyotype analyses (Fig. 2A). Both SeV-mZscan4-TS15 and SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 dramatically increased the percentage of euploidy to 50%, whereas SeV-AG-TS15 did not increase the percentage of euploidy above the level of the control mouse ES cells (Fig. 2B and C). Similar to the Syn-mRNA-treatment, qRT–PCR analyses confirmed that the ZSCAN4 products delivered by the SeV-mZscan4-TS15 and SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 functioned in mouse ES cells (Fig. 2D).

The data also indicate that not only mouse Zscan4, but also human ZSCAN4 functions in the same manner in mouse ES cells.3.2. Synthetic mRNAs encoding human ZSCAN4 increase euploid cells in DS fibroblast cellsTo investigate whether human ZSCAN4 biologics could correct aneuploidy in human cells, we examined the effects of synthetic mRNAs (Syn-hZSCAN4 and Syn-GFP as a control) on non-immortalized primary fibroblast cells isolated from an individual with DS (AG05397: 47,XY,+21). Cells (5 × 104cells/well) were plated in a 6-well plate and then treated with 1 µg of synthetic mRNAs (Syn-hZSCAN4 or Syn-GFP) using 5 µl of Lipofectamine (see Materials and methods) (Fig. 3A). The efficiency of synthetic mRNA delivery and subsequent protein production were monitored 1 day after the treatment by fluorescence microscopy for GFP and by immunohistochemistry for ZSCAN4. We found that efficiency varied from experiment to experiment, but was within the range of 50–80% (Fig. 3B). Analyses of human trisomy 21 primary fibroblast cells treated with Syn-mRNAs.

(F) Summary of G-banded karyotype analyses of AG05397 fibroblast cells.We assessed the copy number of chromosome 21, 14 days after Syn-mRNAs treatment by counting the number of signals (dots) in FISH, using a probe hybridizing to the centromeric region of chromosome 21 (see Materials and methods). In interphase nuclei, the presence of three fluorescent dots indicates three copies of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21, DS), whereas the presence of two fluorescent dots indicates two copies (Fig. 3C). After scoring a large number of nuclei with either two or three dots in a blinded manner, the fraction of cells with two dots were calculated. The treatment of AG05397 DS cells with Syn-hZSCAN4 indeed increased the fraction of cells with two dots to 7%, whereas the treatment with a control Syn-GFP showed 1% of cells with two dots (Fig. 3D). These two dots in the control cells are most likely background noise in the FISH assays (see below for details).The analyses thus far relied on counting only chromosome 21, which did not tell us whether other chromosomes were normal after exposure to ZSCAN4 biologics. Therefore, we examined the entire karyotype of these cells with high-resolution G-banded karyotype analyses in a blinded manner (Fig. 3E). Clinical cytologists reported that most cells carried trisomy 21, consistent with a diagnosis of DS, but found, oddly, that 2 nuclei out of 37 examined appeared normal, with no karyotype abnormality in one of three samples (Fig. 3F). It turned out that the cells with a normal karyotype were found only in Syn-hZSCAN4-treated DS cells, but not in non-treated control cells or Syn-GFP-treated control cells (Fig. 3F). These results were consistent with the results obtained by FISH, and also indicated that FISH may have background noise: 1% of Syn-GFP-treated cells showed two dots by FISH, but none were normal by G-banded karyotyping.We repeated the analyses five times for AG05397 cells (47,XY,+21) and also extended the analyses to non-immortalized fibroblast cells derived from two individuals with DS in triplicate: AG06872 cells (47,XX,+21) and AG08942 cells (47,XY,+21) (see Materials and methods for details). The treatment with Syn-hZSCAN4 showed a statistically significant increase in cells with two dots (up to 14%) compared with control Syn-GFP (Fig. 4). The results indicate that the introduction of human ZSCAN4-mRNAs into cells can remove an extra copy of chromosome 21 without seeming to affecting other chromosomes.

SeV vector expressing human ZSCAN4 increases euploid cells in DS fibroblast cellsAs an independent method, we delivered ZSCAN4 to human cells with temperature-sensitive SeV vectors: SeV-TS15 (a permissive temperature of 35°C and non-permissive temperature of 37°C) and SeV-TS7 (a permissive temperature of 35°C, weakly functional temperature at 37°C, and non-permissive temperature at 39°C).22First, we treated non-immortalized primary fibroblast cells isolated from individuals with DS (AG05397 and AG05024) with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15. As controls, non-treated cells and cells treated with SeV-AG-TS15 were used. Immediately after plating cells (5 × 104cells/well) in a 6-well plate, cells were treated with SeV-TS15 at 25 MOI (multiplicity of infection) (day 0), cultured at 35°C for 7 days, and then cultured continuously at 37°C for 2 weeks (Fig. 5A). On day 7, the production of proteins was monitored by fluorescence microscopy for SeV-AG-TS15 or by immunohistochemistry for SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15. In the third week of treatment (on day 21, 23, or 24), we assessed the fraction of cells with two dots (two copies of chromosome 21) by scoring more than 100 nuclei for each sample by FISH. Figure 5B shows a summary of results in three biological replications each: treating DS fibroblast cells with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 showed a statistically significant increase in cells with two dots over non-treated controls cells and cells treated with a control SeV-AG-TS15.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Next, we tested SeV-hZSCAN4-TS7 in two different conditions: after the treatment of AG05397 DS cells, incubating cells at 35°C for 7 days, followed by the incubation at 37°C for 2 weeks (Fig. 5C); and after the treatment of AG06872 DS cells, incubating cells at 37°C for 7 days, followed by incubation at 39°C for 3 days, and further incubation at 37°C for 11 days (Fig. 5D). In both conditions, the treatment with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS7 showed a statistically significant increase in cells with two dots compared with non-treated control cells and cells treated with control SeV-AG-TS7.To test the long-term effects of the treatments, we treated AG05397 (47,XY,+21) fibroblast cells with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 or SeV-AG-TS15 (control), cultured them at 35°C for 6 days, and subsequently continued culturing at 37°C (Fig. 6A). As a non-treated control, the same AG05397 cells were subjected to the same culture conditions except for the SeV-TS15 treatment. The analyses by immunohistochemistry on day 7 showed that ~50–80% of cells were positive for AG or ZSCAN4, indicating the efficient delivery of ZSCAN4 protein to the cells (Fig. 6B). We sampled these cells and examined the number of chromosome 21 by FISH analyses every 1–2 weeks up to 8 weeks (Fig. 6A). As expected, after one treatment with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15, the presence of cells with two dots had already increased in the second week and remained within the ranges between 8 and 24% until at least the eighth week (Fig. 6C). Strikingly, high-resolution G-banded karyotype analyses of cells sampled in the sixth week revealed that 41% (15 out of 37 nuclei examined) had a normal karyotype in a blinded experiment (Fig. 6D and E).

(E) Summary of G-banded karyotype analysis of AG05397 fibroblast cells sampled in the sixth week.3.4. Assessment of allelic balance by whole-exome sequencingWe further examined the integrity of the genome by carrying out 50-fold coverage whole-exome sequencing analyses on the cells sampled in the eighth week in a blinded test (Fig. 6A): non-treated control cells, SeV-AG-TS15-treated control cells, and SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15-treated cells. Sequences were compared with the reference human genome sequence (hg19) and sequence variants were identified by The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).25 The quality of the obtained sequences and the detailed analysis pipeline are described in the Materials and methods section. The examination of variants of three samples for trisomic chromosome 21 as well as all other chromosomes revealed that these variants were biallelic, i.e. heterozygous or homozygous. The absence of the third alleles implied that the extra chromosome 21 was a duplicated copy of chromosome 21 of either parent. This also indicates that in all three samples, there was no contamination of cells derived from a person other than the donor of AG05397 (47,XY,+21) fibroblast cells.To detect the changes of chromosome number in the cells, we used ‘AlleleBalance (AB)’—variant annotations provided by the GATK, which was calculated based on the read depth of a reference allele (REF) and an alternative allele (ALT).25 More specifically, to distinguish parental chromosomes, we used heterozygous AlleleBalance (ABHet), which was obtained by dividing the number of REF alleles by the total number of alleles at each variant locus throughout the human genome. In theory, the score of the ABHet should be close to 0.5 for heterozygous alleles. Figure 7 shows the histograms of trisomic chromosome 21 as well as comparably sized chromosomes 20 and 22. For both chromosomes 20 and 22, in all three samples, the distributions of the ABHet peaked around 0.5 as expected. In contrast, for chromosome 21, in non-treated control and SeV-AG-treated control samples, the distributions of the ABHet peaked between 0.3 and 0.4 and between 0.6 and 0.7. This implied that the distribution of ABHet was distorted by an extra chromosome 21. For example, if a REF allele is ‘A’ and an ALT allele is ‘G’, an expected ABHet score in trisomy 21 would be 0.33 (for the trisomic genotype AGG) or 0.66 (for the trisomic genotype AAG). Therefore, the two peaks were as expected. Interestingly, for the SeV-hZSCAN4-treated cells, the two peaks were reduced and the frequency of disomic alleles (0.5 peak) increased. This result was consistent with the presence of cells with both a normal disomic chromosome 21 and a trisomic chromosome 21 in the SeV-hZSCAN4-treated cells, although the exome sequencing of a single sample does not allow the quantitative estimation of the percentage of disomic cells in culture. Taken together, the exome sequencing analyses confirmed the removal of an entire chromosome 21 in some cells in culture by the ZSCAN4 biologics. In other words, the treatment with the ZSCAN4 biologics changed cells with homogeneously trisomy 21 into a mosaic of cells with trisomy 21 and cells with a normal karyotype. Whole-exome sequencing analysis. Analyses of DS fibroblast cells sampled from the eighth week (shown in Fig. 6A) by whole-exome sequencing.

Telomere qPCR showed that SeV-hZSCAN4-treated cells indeed carried longer telomeres than control SeV-AG-treated cells or non-treated cells (Fig. 8A). The result was consistent with our earlier finding that ZSCAN4 can extend telomeres in mouse ES cells.15Analyses of trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 cells treated with SeV vectors.

ZSCAN4 biologics increase euploid cells in fibroblast cells derived from individuals with trisomy 18To see whether ZSCAN4 can function comparably on other trisomic aneuploidies, we treated non-immortalized primary fibroblast cells (AG12614: 47,XX,+18) derived from an individual with trisomy 18—Edwards syndrome. First, we treated the cells in triplicate with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS7 and incubated them at 37°C for 6 days, followed by incubation at 39°C for 3 days and further incubation at 37°C for 12 days. FISH analyses using a chromosome 18-specific probe showed that SeV-mediated delivery of ZSCAN4 protein to the trisomy 18 cells increased the cells with two dots significantly over the non-treated control cells and cells treated with the control SeV-AG-TS7 (Fig. 8B). As an independent assessment, we treated the AG12614 trisomy 18 cells in triplicate with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 and incubated at 35°C for 6 days, followed by the incubation at 37°C for 15 days. Treatment with SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 showed a statistically significant increase in cells with two dots over the non-treated control cells and cells treated with a control SeV-AG-TS15 (Fig. 8C). These results indicate that ZSCAN4 can increase euploid cells in cells with not only trisomy 21, but also trisomy 18.4. DiscussionHuman ZSCAN4 is surprisingly potent in increasing the number of euploid cells in mouse ES cells and non-immortalized human fibroblast cells carrying trisomy 21 or trisomy 18 (Fig. 8D). As far as we know, this is the first agent that can improve the karyotype of cells with chromosome abnormalities that have been considered to be irremediable.4.1. ZSCAN4 biologicsWe have produced and tested two kinds of ZSCAN4 biologics, i.e. synthetic mRNAs encoding mouse or human ZSCAN4 and Sendai virus vector expressing mouse or human ZSCAN4 for treatment in vitro and in vivo. Both kinds of biologics can transiently deliver ZSCAN4 to cells efficiently—one simply adds the biologics to the cells, leaving no footprint or exogenous DNA. These methods are particularly suitable to ZSCAN4, because it does not require constitutive or long-term expression to take effect. In fact, it functions normally, and in comparably short pulses, in early embryos and ES cells.As we reported earlier, mouse Zscan4 genes comprise nine copies, one of which is the Zscan4c gene that has been used in the course of our study, whereas human ZSCAN4 is a single copy gene.14 Human ZSCAN4 is expressed in a subpopulation of tissue stem cells in the adult human pancreas17 and in human preimplantation embryos,18 but it has not been clear if the functions that we had seen for mouse Zscan4 could be applied to human genes and human cells. The results here show that in fact human ZSCAN4 is equally or more potent than mouse Zscan4 in human fibroblast cells and also in mouse ES cells. Thus, human ZSCAN4 biologics may be useful for experimentation in both human and mouse cells. Among the reagents, SeV-hZSCAN4-TS15 seems to be the most promising thus far, giving consistent effects and the highest efficiency. Optimum delivery vehicles, doses, timing, duration, and other conditions remain to be determined both in vitro culture and in vivo in the future.4.2. Possible mechanismsZSCAN4 biologics rapidly improve karyotypes in mouse ES cells and human trisomic fibroblast cells, strongly suggesting that the ZSCAN4 protein corrects karyotype abnormalities directly and efficiently, presumably during the replication of the cells. Alternatively, one could imagine that ZSCAN4 might kill cells with an abnormal karyotype or suppress their proliferation, so that the proportion of cells with a normal karyotype would effectively increase. It could also be argued that spontaneously corrected euploid cells have a growth advantage over aneuploid cells and take over the culture over time. Such possibilities are, however, very unlikely. For mouse ES cells, we observed that karyotype improvement occurred within a few days without noticeable cell death. Although the forced expression of Zscan4 slows down the proliferation of mouse ES cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, there has been no indication of aneuploidy-specific growth suppression.33 It has also been commonly observed that the proportion of aneuploid cells in mouse ES cell cultures increases over time.16 For human trisomic cells, we also observed the emergence of euploid cells without noticeable cell death in culture. Although recent reports noted that euploid cells grow faster than cells with trisomy 21,10,11 this does not seem to be the case in general according to detailed literature reviews.3 In this case, we should have seen a steady increase in the fraction of euploid cells in long-term culture after treating trisomy 21 cells with ZSCAN4 biologics; however, such a phenomenon was not observed (e.g. see Fig. 6C). It is also an unlikely explanation that ZSCAN4 specifically suppresses the proliferation of cells with trisomy, but not the proliferation of cells with a normal karyotype. For this explanation to be possible, all trisomic fibroblast cells that we have tested should have contained cells with a normal karyotype from the beginning (i.e. mosaicism) or should have gone through spontaneous correction of trisomy. However, these relatively rare events cannot account for all of the cases that we have studied here. With these explanations in mind, the most reasonable interpretation of the results presented in this report is that ZSCAN4 biologics directly correct karyotype abnormality, although other possibilities cannot be completely excluded at this point.Given all of the cumulative data presented in this paper and previous work, what molecular mechanism explains the correction of karyotypes? Preliminarily, we speculate that ZSCAN4 biologics may correct aneuploidy based on mechanisms occurring naturally during organ development and maintenance. Indeed, anecdotal observations show that an abnormal karyotype is sometimes corrected during early preimplantation development,34 at the same time when mouse and human ZSCAN4 is highly and specifically expressed.14,18 A further hint about the mechanism comes from our earlier observations of Zscan4-mediated telomere elongation that increases genome stability in mouse ES cells.15 Interestingly, in the current study, we have seen comparable telomere elongation in human fibroblast cells by ZSCAN4 biologics, suggesting possible involvement of telomere regulation or steps in common with that process in the correction of karyotypes. Perhaps more importantly, the accompanying paper shows that transient and infrequent bursts of Zscan4 expression (named ‘Z4 events’) are accompanied by the rapid derepression of heterochromatin, particularly in the pericentromeric region, and the clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin around the nucleolus.35 The accompanying paper also shows that at least some of these Zscan4 functions are mediated by forming complexes with both activating and repressing chromatin remodelling complexes,35 most likely through its SCAN domain for protein–protein interaction.36 In mouse ES cells, Zscan4 causes dramatic changes in the pericentromeric region—a fact is consistent with our findings reported here because the pericentromeric region is known to be critical for chromosome segregation and maintenance of a normal karyotype. However, it remains to be seen whether Z4 events can also occur in human fibroblast cells. The general implication is that during meiosis or mitosis, a ZSCAN4-mediated mechanism, possibly involving interactions with centromeres and/or telomeres, detects unpaired chromosomes and detaches them from the replication apparatus. Whatever the detailed mechanism, it now seems clear that ZSCAN4 is a material cause for the correction of aneuploidy: the mechanism operates independent of the vehicle of ZSCAN4 delivery to yield a dramatic increase in cells with normal karyotype.4.3. Possible therapeutic applications of ZSCAN4 biologicsIt is worth pointing out that irrespective of the mechanism of ZSCAN4 action, treating aneuploid cells with ZSCAN4 biologics increases the number of euploid cells. Its rapid action and high efficiency have allowed its direct application to non-immortalized primary human fibroblast cells. The potential efficacy of ZSCAN4 therapies is increased by the possibility that partial correction, as we have already seen, may have a significant effect. This is suggested by the milder DS phenotype conferred by mosaicism of trisomy 21 cells with a normal karyotype.7 In a similar way, direct ZSCAN4 treatment might provide alleviation of conditions.ZSCAN4 biologics may also improve and maintain the quality of pluripotent stem cells in humans, mice, and other model organisms. One possible use is in mouse and human ES cells or iPS cells, which have been widely used to generate animal models for human diseases, or possible sources of regenerative tissue. Currently, their quality is often compromised during the long-term cell culture required for genetic engineering.In summary, the results presented here suggest the possibility of a new therapy for genetic errors and chromosome abnormalities. As a naturally occurring protein that functions normally in very restricted timings and places during organ development and maintenance, it is conceivable that ZSCAN4 biologics may be developed into a ‘natural chromosome therapy’.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was in part supported by a grant from the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund.

IntroductionDNA methylation is a mechanism behind epigenetic changes in gene expression in diverse species including mammals.1,2 5-Methylcytosine plays an important role in gene silencing, genomic imprinting,3,4 X-chromosome inactivation,5 cancer progression,6,7 embryonic development and tissue differentiation.8–11 Recent studies reported the tissue- or cell line-specific difference of DNA methylation which contributes to regulating tissue- or cell-specific gene expression.12–16 Cell immortalization can lead to the accumulation of DNA methylation at promoter regions, resulting in corresponding changes in gene expression.17In mammals, DNA methylation occurs preferentially at cytosine and guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), which tend to cluster in highly enriched short regions (0.2–2 kb) known as CpG islands (CGIs); ~50–60% of promoter regions are associated with CGIs.18,19 The levels of CpG methylation at CGI and promoter regions are lower than those at other CpG sites19,20 and play an important role in regulating gene expression.21Several methods including bisulfite sequencing, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS),19,22 methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-seq),23 methyl-binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq, MethylCap-seq)24–26 and BeadChip array (Infinium27) have been developed to analyse patterns of DNA methylation across diverse genomes.2,28,29 Aberrant methylation patterns on chromosomes or a part of genome can cause developmental abnormalities or diseases.30 Several large-scale projects including the International Human Epigenome Consortium (http://www.ihec-epigenomes.org/), human ENCODE project (https://www.encodeproject.org/) and Blueprint Epigenome (http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/) are in progress for a deeper understanding of the functional importance of epigenetic changes including DNA methylation. Recently, the International Swine Methylome Consortium (ISMC) was organized to generate the swine reference methylome map to illuminate the importance of epigenetic changes to phenotypic variations in production traits31–34 and disease progression.30,35–39 Although genome-wide methylation studies of farm animals have recently been published for sheep,40 cattle,41,42 horses43 and pigs,44 the depth of data and tissue coverage are still limited compared with that of humans and mice.The importance of domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), as large animal biomedical models for human diseases, has recently been recognized for its similarity to humans in organ size and structure, general physiology and disease phenotypes.45 Advantages in animal husbandry, large litter size and short generation interval of pigs make them more suitable as animal models over primate models, although the phylogenetic relationship of pigs to humans is more distant than that of primates to humans.The completion of the draft reference genome of the pig46 has allowed production of previously unachievable results using sequence-based genome-wide studies on variations or evolutionary changes.47–49 Although the analysis of global genome methylation using MeDIP-seq50 and RRBS44 was reported in pigs, the results from more diverse tissues at single base-pair resolution are necessary to have better understanding of the methylation profiles of the pig genome related to chromosomal variations, gene features, CGI association and non-biparental expression.In this study, we analysed pig methylome of five different tissues including the neocortex, spleen, muscle, liver and olfactory epithelium, and a pulmonary alveolar macrophage (PAM) cell line (3D4/2) by using the RRBS method. We compared the methylation profiles across different tissues and described the similarity and differences of the pig methylome from human and mice methylomes in previously reported RRBS analysis. Further, we included the results of methylome analysis from several previously unreported tissues and demonstrated the successful use of RRBS on pig genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics statementThe experimental procedure was approved and supervised by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea. Three individuals of 9-week-old Landrace × Yorkshire crossbreed pigs in good health were purchased from local farm, deeply anaesthetized and sacrificed.2.2. Sample preparation and genomic DNA isolationTarget tissues including the neocortex, spleen, liver, femoral muscle and olfactory epithelium were dissected out, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until use. Pig pulmonary alveolar macrophages cell line 3D4/2 (ATCC® CRL-2845™) was cultured in T75 cell culture flasks (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon, Korea) using an RPMI 1640 culture medium (ATCC modification) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Genomic DNA was extracted from 0.5 g tissue or from 3 × 107 cells. Briefly, tissues were incubated in 400 µl of tissue lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.2% SDS) with 250 µg/ml proteinase K at 55°C for 6 h, and cell pellets were incubated in 400 µl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM EDTA and 0.5% SDS) at 37°C for 6 h, followed by phenol extraction. Isolated DNA was incubated with 20 µg/ml DNase-free RNase and purified using a PowerClean® DNA Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.2.3. Sequencing and reads alignmentThe construction of RRBS libraries and paired-end sequencing using a HiSeq2000 analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was performed at BGI-Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 ng of pooled genomic DNA with an equal amount from three individuals was used for the construction of each RRBS library. Genomic DNA was digested with MspI enzyme (recognition site C^CGG, NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) at 37°C for 16 h. After purification, single A nucleotides were added to the digested blunt-end products, followed by ligation to methylated adapter with T overhang. Ligated products corresponding to DNA fragments 40–220 bp long were purified by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Bisulfite conversion was conducted using a ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold™ Kit (ZYMO, Irvine, CA, USA). The final libraries were generated by PCR amplification. RRBS libraries were analysed by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified by real-time PCR. The sequenced paired-end read length was 49 bp. Raw sequencing data were processed by an Illumina base-calling pipeline. Clean reads were aligned to the modified pig reference genome (Sscrofa10.2) in an unbiased way for bisulfite sequencing data. After removing adaptor sequences, clean reads were aligned to two modified references with BS-seeker 2 v. 2.0.851 using Bowtie 2 v. 2.1.052 in local alignment mode and allowing no more than four mismatches per read. Methylation status was determined using the bs_seeker2-call_methylation.py script and only uniquely aligned reads. For the simulation analysis of pig genome RRBS, we performed an in silico restriction analysis of the current pig reference genome (Sus scrofa 10.2) for MspI or MspI/ApeKI and set the fragment size to 40–220 bp.2.4. RRBS data analysisMethylation levels of cytosines were analysed by methylKit.53 Briefly, the number of methylated and unmethylated CpG and non-CpG (CHG and CHH, H representing A/C/T) sites was counted for each region. CGIs were defined as regions >200 bp with a GC fraction >0.5 and an observed-to-expected ratio of CpG >0.6. CGI shores were defined as regions 2 kb in length adjacent to CGIs.18 The porcine CGIs annotation was downloaded from USCS (http://genome.ucsc.edu/, susScr3). The porcine gene annotation was downloaded from the Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/, protein-coding genes). To define the differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs), multiple pairwise comparisons were performed against CpG methylation information of six samples and filtered (q < 0.01) using methylKit.53 Tissue-specific differentially methylated CpG sites (tDMC) were identified by a script which we developed to select the CpGs showing tissue-specific methylation levels in comparison to other samples. The result of each comparison among different tissues was compiled. Filtered DMCs were annotated based on genes and CGI features including gene bodies and upstream 2, 5 and 10 kb regions from the TSS. The number of DMCs was visualized by Venn Diagrams using the Jvenn (http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/jvenn/index.html).542.5. Functional annotation of tDMC and correlation analysis between the methylation level and gene expressionGene ontological (GO) analysis was carried out for tDMC using an in-house developed script. The swine GO terms were downloaded from the Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) and the gene sets obtained from tDMC analysis for each tissue. Gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The gene expression profiles created with 27k cDNAs probes and 23 healthy porcine tissues (GEO accession ID: GSE4918)55 were downloaded. The tissues and accession numbers used in this study are frontal cortex (GSM110567 and GSM110545), liver (GSM110543 and GSM110569), biceps femoris (GSM110549 and GSM110577) and spleen (GSM110571 and GSM110546), respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across four tissues were identified using the GEO2R plugin (P < 0.05) after the adjustment for multiple testing. The correlation between the levels of gene expression and methylation in tDMCs was calculated by the Pearson's correlation test.2.6. Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using R programming language (version 3.1.1).56 Statistical difference in methylation rates of CpG and non-CpG sites across tissues was determined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The Pearson's correlation test was used to compare the global methylation patterns and the specific methylation patterns for CGI and CGI shore across tissues which were implemented using methylKit package (version 0.9.2).53 The clustering analysis with the methylation levels and patterns of different samples was carried out using Ward's minimum variance method implemented in methylKit package.53 The statistical significance of enrichments and/or depletions of GO was calculated by the hypergeometric test57 and multiple test correction using R language.3. Results3.1. In silico analysis of pig genome to predict possible coverage of CpG sites from RRBSIn silico restriction analysis of the pig genome using enzymes MspI was carried out to predict the possible coverage of CpG sites from the RRBS analysis of the pig genome. The in silico pig genome RRBS library consisting of DNA fragments in a size range of 40–220 bp resulted in a total of 2,371,480 fragments for MspI digestion.We performed in silico analyses of the distribution pattern of restricted fragments of the pig genome in the window of 200 bp with a 20-bp increment, starting from 200 and up to 500 bp for MspI digestion. In addition, 40–220 bp window was analysed as a comparison to the result of humans and mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). The results were similar to those of humans and mice in which the 40- to 220-bp window covers 37.8% of total fragments of MspI-digested libraries.58Our in silico analysis showed that 28% of generated fragments digested by MspI was expected to be distributed in the 40- to 220-bp window, which corresponds to 2.6% of the pig genome. For CpG sites, 11.9% of the total CpG sites of the pig genome were predicted in MspI libraries (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The size of the pig reduced representation (RR) genome was the closest to that of the human. Comparison between porcine and other reduced representation (RR) genomesAll RR genomes were simulated by selecting DNA fragment in a 40- to 220-bp window after in silico restriction enzyme digestion.Comparison between porcine and other reduced representation (RR) genomesAll RR genomes were simulated by selecting DNA fragment in a 40- to 220-bp window after in silico restriction enzyme digestion.3.2. Mapping and analysis of RRBS reads from five tissues and a cell lineWe constructed MspI single restriction RRBS libraries as an initial study of the RRBS analysis of the pig genome. According to the in silico analysis, the coverage of nearly 54.71% of total CpGs within CGI (1,295,120 of 2,367,139 total CpGs within CGI) and ~83.49% of CpGs within the upstream 2 kb region from the transcription start sites (TSS) (250,631 of 300,187 protein-coding genes) was expected in the MspI-digested pig RRBS library.A total of six libraries were constructed with 40- to 220-bp insert fragments, which is identical to RRBS studies in humans and mice,58 from five tissues including the neocortex, spleen, liver, muscle, olfactory epithelium and a 3D4/2 (PAM) cell line. We generated a minimum of 3.25Gb clean reads from each RRBS library with the maximum of 5.48Gb from the liver (Table 2). The sequences were submitted to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under the study accession number, PRJEB9561. An average of 59.56% of total paired-end reads were aligned to the reference genome according to the criteria described in Materials and methods (Table 2). The reads with a single placement, minimum number of mismatches (4 mismatches per read) and clear strand assignment were defined as uniquely mapped reads. The percentage of uniquely mapped reads was 56.89, 57.16, 50.77, 51.76, 53.56 and 55.08% for the neocortex, spleen, liver, muscle, olfactory epithelium and 3D4/2 cells, respectively, with the average of 54.2%. The frequency of multi-mapped reads ranged from 4.92 to 5.74% for different samples (Table 2). The coverage of CpGs detected within CGIs and the upstream 2 kb region from TSS ranged from 38.3 to 43.32% and 58.75 to 67.8% of total CpGs in the genome, respectively. This is somewhat lower than the theoretical predicted value (54.71% for CGI and 83.49% for upstream 2 kb from TSS) of the simulation because of the efficiency difference between the experiment and theoretical analysis (Supplementary Table S1). The results from our experimental analysis are in accord with the expected values from the simulation, indicating the validity of our data. Details of mapping of porcine RRBS librariesOE: olfactory epithelium.Details of mapping of porcine RRBS librariesOE: olfactory epithelium.Subsequently, we selected CpG sites that were present >10 times in the mapping, namely CpG10, and subjected them to further analyses. The mean coverage of CpG10 was 37- to 56.5-fold among tissues (Supplementary Table S2). The frequency of CpG10 was similar across the six samples, and the average coverage rates of CpG10 for gene-related regions including exon, intron and 10 kb upstream of TSS were 50.88, 44.38 and 42.58%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.3. Global methylation profile of the pig RR genomeRRBS analysis of mammalian genome showed the enrichment of CpG-rich regions2,60 and the presence of a large amount of unmethylated CpG sites in CGIs.19,61 The percentage of methylated CpG sites in the pig RR genome ranged from 47.83 to 53.05% in the six different samples (Table 2). The distribution of read coverage per base for each sample shows that the results did not much suffer from PCR duplication bias, which forms a secondary peak towards the right side of the histograms (Supplementary Fig. S3).53Methylated CpG sites can be classified by the methylation levels to hypo- (<10%), intermediate (20–80%) and hyper-methylated CpGs (>90%), and the frequencies of three differently methylated CpG10 groups ranged from 34.5 to 40.2%, 18.3 to 23.8% and 21.4 to 28.5%, respectively, of total CpG sites, depending on the type of tissue, showing that hypo-methylated CpG sites were the largest group (Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, relatively higher hyper- and heavily methylated CpGs (>95%) were detected from 3D4/2 cells than from other tissues (P = 0.0035 and 0.0008 for hyper- and heavy methylation, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S3). The distribution of percentage methylation from our study using five tissues and a cell line showed a pattern analogous to the bimodal distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4), which is similar to the previous mammalian RRBS studies.19,62,63Our analysis showed that the global CpG methylation is similar among the neocortex, spleen, liver, femoral muscle and olfactory epithelium (Pearson's correlation score: 0.95–0.96). However, comparisons of tissues versus 3D4/2 cell line showed significant difference in the distribution of the CpG methylation (Pearson's correlation score: 0.69–0.7, Fig. 1A). The distance among different tissues based on the global methylation level is shown in Fig. 2. CpG methylation among six different samples showed that the levels of methylation of 2 kb upstream of TSS and CGIs of the PAM cell line (3D4/2) were significantly higher than those in other tissues (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S5). Regarding the results of the PAM cell line, we manually confirmed the methylation patterns of several randomly selected CpG sites detected in our RRBS by independent bisulfite sequencing. A total of 7 DMRs were amplified from the bisulfite-treated genomic DNA template and sequenced. The seven DMRs were located on four hypo-methylated (ABLIM2, CBFA2T3, SDK1 and TBCD)- and three hyper-methylated genes (CD14, DKC1 and GPC3)-associated regions in the PAM cell line. All results were consistent with those from the RRBS analysis of 3D4/2 (data not shown). Correlation analysis of the CpG methylation patterns among different tissues.

Distance between tissues according to their methylation patterns was estimated by the Ward's minimum variance method.The rates of methylation for non-CpG sites (CHG and CHH; H representing A/C/T) varied from 1.63 to 1.71% of the total non-CpGs except for the neocortex, which showed slightly higher amount of methylated non-CpGs (2.3% of the total) compared with other tissues (Table 2 and Fig. 3). This result is consistent with that in a previous report in humans.64 We also observed differences in the level of methylation of 2 kb upstream of TSS and CGI regions of non-CpG sites (CHG and CHH) from the PAM and neocortex (Fig. 3B, C and D). Also, the percentage of methylated non-CpG sites in the 2 kb upstream region of TSS of the liver was higher over the spleen, muscle and olfactory epithelium, which was contributed by higher CHG methylation rate of the 2 kb upstream region of TSS in the liver than others.

Methylation of CGI and CGI shoreCorrelation of methylation levels among tissues was performed at CGIs and CGI shores (2 kb regions on either side of CGIs), which constitute the largest portion of CpG10 with its CGI features such as CGI, CGI shore and CGI shelf (regions 2 kb further from CGI shores) (Supplementary Fig. S6). More than half of CpG10 (60.2–62.4%) were mapped to CGIs and the CGI shores. Non-CGI regions within CpG10 ranged from 31.59 to 33.47% among the tested tissues. The rest of CpG10 were mapped to the CGI shelf. The density of CpG10 gradually decreased when moving away from CGIs as reported in humans and mouse.19,65 The per cent methylation of CpG10 in CGI features was compared across tissues. The CGI shores showed a much higher degree of methylation than CGI (Fig. 1B and C), which is consistent with previous reports that the methylation level of CGI was lower than that of the CGI shore and global regions.19,65 The Pearson's correlation values among the methylation rates of the neocortex, spleen, liver, muscle and olfactory epithelium within CGI shore were from 0.91 to 0.93, which is somewhat lower than those of CGI (0.96–0.97), indicating the presence of tissue-specific methylation despite the small difference (Fig. 1). Results of individual DMCs were summarized in Supplementary Table S4.3.5. CpG association to gene features in pig methylomeThe current annotation of the Ensembl gene set for the pig genome shows 21,607 protein-coding genes (www.ensembl.org/Sus_scrofa/). Excluding genes on unplaced scaffolds and mitochondrial DNA, 19,429 genes with chromosomal assignment were used to define the gene features including exon, intron and upstream 2, 5 and 10 kb of TSS (Supplementary Fig. S2). On average, 24.1% of total CpG10 was mapped to the gene body (8.08% to exons and 16.2% to introns), and this covered 77.74% of the expected gene body regions which according to the RRBS simulation (Supplementary Table S5). Depending on the type of tissues, 6.29–6.52% and 10.24–10.49% of CpG10 were localized 5 and 10 kb upstream of TSS, respectively. The patterns of CpG10 association to gene features were consistent across different tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.6. Comparison of gene number and methylation rate in pig chromosomesTo address the influence of gene density on methylation rates of pig chromosomes, we compared the observed methylation rates with the number of expected CpG sites and the number of genes for each chromosome (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5). The percentage methylation rate was similar across chromosomes except for chromosome Y. In most of the chromosomes, there was a strong positive correlation between the total number of CpG sites and genes. The exception was the ratio of CpG sites to gene numbers in chromosomes 3, 6 and 12, which was higher than the ratio in other chromosomes and was reversed for chromosome 13. However, as expected, the GC percentage of the chromosomes was correlated with the CpG methylation for each chromosome (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5). We hypothesized that chromosomes with higher gene numbers could result in lower methylation level than chromosomes with lower gene density, because promoter and CGI regions showed lower levels of CpG methylation than other genomic features (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5) and the CpG density of those regions was higher than the average. However, no correlation was observed between gene number and CpG methylation levels of chromosomes in our analysis. The observed methylation rates were similar among different tissues except for 3D4/2 cells, especially for the upstream 2 and 5 kb regions of TSS (Fig. 4). Comparison of the methylation levels in gene-related regions in relation to the numbers of genes and CpGs on individual pig chromosomes.

Methylation patterns of imprinted genes from RRBS analysis of the pig genomeWe analysed the RRBS reads corresponding to 22 out of 30 genes known for genomic imprinting in pigs (http://www.geneimprint.com/), which had annotation of genomic location in Sscrofa10.2 (data not shown). Among them, eight genes, DIO3, DIRAS3, MEG3, MEST, NAP1L5, NECD, NNAT, PHLDA2, satisfied our criteria to be selected as candidates for the analysis of imprinted genes, which includes clear genomic locations including gene bodies and the upstream 2 and 2–10 kb regions from TSS in the current pig genome assembly (Supplementary Table S6). Interestingly, the levels of CpG methylation of the eight known imprinted genes were significantly higher than those of randomly selected non-imprinted genes (GAPDH, COX5B and ACTA1) at gene bodies and upstream 2 kb of TSS regions in pig tissue samples (Fig. 5). The difference was less consistent in the upstream 2–10 kb region of TSS. In addition, we found a difference in the level of methylation among different tissues. Especially, the difference was the largest in 3D4/2 cells. For example, CpGs in the gene bodies of DIO3, DIRAS3, MEG3 and NNAT were highly methylated comparing with other tissues. The methylation patterns of upstream 2 and 2–10 kb regions from TSS were also similar (Fig. 5). The pattern of CpG methylation of imprinted genes from six tissues in pigs.

Identification of tDMCsDMCs were identified using methylKit from six samples (q-value <0.01, Supplementary Fig. S7 and Table S7). Among the DMCs, tissue specifically methylated CpGs were selected. A total of 63,482 and 32,410 tissue-specific DMCs (tDMCs) were identified from gene bodies and upstream 10 kb region from TSS, respectively, under the cut-off value of 30% methylation difference. Excluding the PAM cell library, only 4,780 and 1,680 tDMCs were identified from gene bodies and upstream 10 kb regions from TSS, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8). Among the tissue samples, spleen-specific DMCs were the largest and occupied 28.7% of the total and followed by the liver (24.1%) and olfactory epithelium (23.1%). Neocortex- and muscle-specific libraries constitute 9.3 and 14.8% of the total tDMCs, respectively (Fig. 6). The tDMC profile including chromosomal positions was summarized in Supplementary Table S8.

Functional annotation of tDMCsIdentified tDMCs were mapped to 1,897 genes on the basis of their genomic location (Supplementary Fig. S9). GO analysis was performed for tDMCs in each tissue (Supplementary Tables S9 and S10). Statistical significance of GO terms to tDMCs was evaluated by the hypergeometric test with a multiple correction. The results showed that some of highly ranked GO were matched with characteristics of the tissues. In the neocortex, ‘olfactory behaviour’, ‘positive regulation of neural precursor cell proliferation’, ‘norepinephrine biosynthetic process’, ‘brain development’ and other neuronal signal transduction-related GO terms were significant (q < 0.05). The GO terms for functions of the liver were significantly associated, including ‘enzyme regulator activity’, ‘glycolytic process’, ‘positive regulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic process’, ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’ and other metabolic activity-related terms. Similarly, ‘actin cytoskeleton’ and ‘mesodermal cell fate specification’ were specific GO terms for the muscle. ‘Leucocyte-mediated cytotoxicity’, ‘focal adhesion’ and ‘cell migration’ were significant for spleen-specific, DMCs-related genes. For PAM cells, GO terms were enriched with transcription regulation-associated terms (Supplementary Table S9). For the olfactory epithelium, we were unable to find significant GO terms matching to the biological characteristics of the tissue, which may be due to the reason that the tissue constitutes of only a small number of olfactory function-related cells together with epithelial cells.3.10. Correlation between tDMCs and gene expressionTo evaluate the influence of DNA methylation on gene expression, we analysed the association between tDMCs and gene expression profiles of the frontal cortex, liver, biceps femoris and spleen. DEGs across four tissues were identified using the GEO2R plugin (P < 0.05) from a microarrary dataset of the GEO database. First, we selected genes (n = 42) present in both tDMCs-associated groups from RRBS and DEG groups from microarrary transcriptome analyses. The Pearson's correlation test showed that a total of 55 tDMCs which associated with 27 genes showed strong negative correlation between the levels of gene expression and CpG methylation (Table 3).

The expression levels of those three genes were higher in neocortex than in other tissues (adjusted P-value <0.05). Fourteen out of 15 tDMCs were located on gene bodies, but only a single tDMC that associated with NRXN2 was mapped to the upstream 10 kb region from TSS. In the muscle, 18 tDMCs were associated with 11 genes and showed negative correlation between the levels of expression and methylation (average Pearson's correlation score less than -0.884). The tDMCs of NR5A2,66PCOLCE and VGLL2 which promote muscle development and activities were up-regulated and hypo-methylated. For the spleen, tDMCs of three immune-related genes ICAM1, CD163 and TBKBP1 were hypo-methylated (Table 3).4. DiscussionThe completion of the pig genome assembly (Sscrofa10.2) provides a basis for understanding the epigenetic modifications of the pig genome including DNA methylation, which is another important issue in modern genetics. In this study, we generated the global methylation profiles from the porcine neocortex, spleen, liver, muscle, olfactory epithelium and a PAM cell line and analysed the RR genome of the pig. Although we did not analyse the methylation patterns of a complete list of pig tissues and the entire genome of the pig such as bisulfite sequencing, our results provide valuable input to the characteristics of the pig methylome considering that there have not been sufficient studies on the genome level of the profiles of the pig methylome from various tissues in a single nucleotide resolution.Previously, Li et al.50,67 reported the results on the methylation pattern of the pig genome using MeDIP-seq, which investigated the genome-wide relationship between DNA methylation and fat deposition using adipose tissues of breeds with different phenotypes. Recently, Gao et al.44 presented the RRBS analysis of the pig genome as the first report using the intestinal tissue. However, both studies showed limitations of providing information on only specific tissues or mapping resolution of the study.In this study, we reported the global methylation patterns of five different tissues (the neocortex, spleen, liver, muscle and olfactory epithelium) and a cell line (PAM; 3D4/2) of the pig, which are part of quite diverse biological systems. The results of the global DNA methylation patterns corroborated the results of the previous studies44,58 on the same regions.Because the design of our RRBS analysis of the pig genome including the restriction enzyme and fragment size selection was identical to that in the studies of humans and mice,58 it was appropriate to compare our results to the available data from those species. The size of the pig RR genome was similar to that of human (73 vs. 74 M, respectively, for MspI, Table 1). The RRBS reads of the pig exhibited a slightly lower frequency of multiple mapped reads than human (5.35 vs. 7.7%, respectively), and the percentage of total CpG sites in the pig RR genome (18.34%) was 4.84% higher than in the human, which may be attributed to slightly lower amount of repeat elements (~40% of the genome) in the pig compared with those in the human (nearly 50%).As expected, we observed the enrichment of CpG sites in the RR genome, and the rate was higher in pig (7.1-fold) than in humans (5.8-fold) and mice (5-fold) (Table 1). A drawback of the RRBS is that CpGs within CpG-poor regions are scarcely covered because of the limitations of the RRBS method, which relies on the CpG-associated restriction enzymes. However, ~60% of human gene contain a CGI near the TSS.68 Therefore, RRBS studies can provide information of CGI and gene-associated CpG sites. Our results given in Supplementary Fig. S4 were consistent with the average of 44.21% of CpGs that belonged to the CGI observed in our RRBS analysis. CGIs consisted of only 1.11% of the pig genome and contained 8.44% of the total CpGs in the pig genome.For future RRBS studies of the pig genome, it is necessary to improve the genome coverage to reduce the number of missing CpGs. Comparison of the MspI-digested to the MspI/ApeKI–double-digested RR genomes showed significant improvement in the percentage genome (2.6–12.12 Mb) and the total CpG coverage (18.3–28.4%), which were similar to those of studies in humans and mice.58 Further studies using MspI/ApeKI should significantly improve the genome coverage of RRBS for the pig genome.For GO analysis of the pig genome, gene enrichment analysis using web-based software is difficult to perform because of unavailability of enough functional annotation data. The amount of information on the functional annotation of the pig genome is still limited. As an attempt to overcome the difficulty, we performed a gene enrichment test against our tDMR-related gene dataset using the GeneMANIA (http://www.genemania.org/) software which allows the use of annotation data of the human genome. Our pilot analysis showed that the results were more informative than just relying on pig GO terms (data not shown).Recent studies recognized the importance of CGI shores which might be associated with tissue-specific DMRs (tDMRs) and cancer-specific DMRs (cDMRs).69,70 We detected a difference in the per cent methylation of CGI shore among the six samples. Lower correlation values between CpG methylation levels on CGI shore from different tissues might suggest a correlation with tissue-specific differential methylation (Fig. 1). In this study, we detected 18 tDMCs located in the CGI shore region and they showed strong correlation with the level of gene expression using the transcriptome profile of a microarray experiment. The use of RNA-seq data should improve our understanding between tDMCs and the regulation of gene expression in pigs. The global difference in the level of non-CpG methylation was observed in the neocortex, which showed ~35% more methylated non-CpG sites than other samples (Fig. 3). The amount of methylated non-CpG sites was >1.71% in all samples except in the neocortex (2.3%). The total amount of non-CpG sites (CHG and CHH) was almost four times larger than that of CpG sites (data not shown). Although the difference (0.6%) is small, the actual number of CpGs corresponding to that difference may not be as small and warrants further studies.Recent studies showed that the SV40 large T antigen gene or hTERT transfected immortalized cell line results in DNA hyper-methylation and large-scale changes in gene expression.17 The result also showed the accumulation of DNA methylation at promoter regions according to doubling times or replicative lifespan. This is consistent with our finding of hyper-methylation in 3D4/2 cells which were established by transfecting the SV40 large T antigen (Supplementary Fig. S4). It was reported that a large part of immortality-associated changes in gene expression were related with RNA processing and regulation of transcription factor activity in immortalized cells.71 The GO analysis of tDMCs among different tissues also showed that many of the 3D4/2 cell-specific tDMCs were related to transcriptional regulation. Thus, the uniqueness of the methlylome profile of 3D4/2 cells in this study is consistent to the results of previous methylome analyses using permanent cell lines. However, it still remains inconclusive whether the difference between 3D4/2 cells and other tissues was due to the characteristics of the permanent cell lines or the cell culture conditions or the natural methylation patters of pulmonary alveolar macrophage cells, because only one cell line was included in this study.To create a suitable reference map of porcine methylome to biological studies, DNA methylation profiles from diverse tissues and diverse developmental stages are necessary. Although the list of samples and developmental stages is still far from being complete, our study contributes to the knowledge of DNA methylation in pig genome, which could provide information regarding biological processes in response to environmental changes, development and disease. To our knowledge, our results are among the initial studies to extensively evaluate the general methylation profile of the pig genome at a single base resolution.Authors’ contributionM.K.C. was responsible for sample preparation, genomic DNA isolation, RRBS data analysis using methylKit and involved in drafting the manuscript.

IntroductionAcetic acid bacteria (AAB) are obligate aerobes, and presently comprise 14 genera assigned to the family Acetobacteraceae, including Acetobacter (Ac.), Gluconobacter (Go.), Gluconacetobacter (Ga.), Granulibacter (Gr.), Komagataeibacter (Ko., former Gluconacetobacter), Asaia (As.), Acidomonas (Am.), Kozakia, Swaminathania, Saccharibacter, Neoasaia, Tanticharoenia, Ameyamaea, and Neokomagataea.1,2 AAB incompletely oxidize a variety of sugars and alcohols, and accumulate large amounts of the corresponding oxidation products in their environment or culture media. These traits of AAB, known as oxidative fermentation, are utilized in the industrial production of vinegar, l-sorbose, and bacterial cellulose.Oxidative fermentation reactions occur through a variety of primary dehydrogenases in the periplasmic side of the inner cytoplasmic membrane. Electrons that are generated are transferred to ubiquinone and the reduced ubiquinol is utilized by terminal oxidases in the electron transfer chains to reduce oxygen to water and harness the energy to translocate protons across the cytoplasmic membrane.3 There are two types of terminal oxidases in AAB: cytochrome ba3/bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase and bd-type oxidase, which consist of four subunits encoded by the cyoABCD operon (synonym: cyaBACD) and two subunits encoded by cydAB genes, respectively. Cytochrome ba3/bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase is a member of the haeme–copper oxidase superfamily, which includes cytochrome c oxidase in aerobic respiration of mitochondria and aerobes.4Asaia bogorensis was first isolated from tropical flowers, and is an unusual member of AAB that oxidizes acetate and lactate to carbon dioxide and water, but not ethanol to acetic acid.5 A strain of As. bogorensis isolated from a flower of the orchid tree Bunga bauhinia in Bogor, Indonesia, was assigned to a type strain (=NBRC 16594T= NRIC 0311T= JCM 10569T).5 Based on DNA sequences of 16S rRNA genes, Asaia is phylogenetically located near Gluconobacter and Acetobacter, but is distant from the genera Granulibacter and Gluconacetobacter.5,6 Biochemical analysis revealed that As. bogorensis contains sugar- and sugar alcohol-oxidizing enzymes that are specific to the respiratory chain, such as quinoprotein glycerol dehydrogenase; however, it lacks quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).7 In addition, As. bogorensis was shown to contain a cytochrome bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase as the sole terminal oxidase in the respiratory chain.7Asaia bogorensis can also be an opportunistic pathogen in humans. Asaia bogorensis was first reported as an opportunistic human pathogen when it was isolated from the peritoneal fluids of a patient on peritoneal dialysis who showed a consistent clinical status of infectious peritonitis with end-stage renal disease.8 In addition, it was reported that As. bogorensis caused bacteraemia in patients with a history of intravenous-drug abuse.9 Clinical isolates were highly resistant to antibiotics that were routinely tested against gram-negative bacteria, but not against gentamicin or doxycycline.9,10 As reported about infectious diseases of AAB in humans,6,11,12 it is important to comprehend the genetic bases for the pathogenicity of AAB.Gene contents of organisms may explain their phenotypes, as well as abilities to respond to variety of environmental stresses, and provide us with information regarding their potential to adapt to new ecological niches. Complete genomic DNA sequences from five AAB species have been published for their industrial, agricultural, and clinical significances, including Acetobacter pasteurianus,13,14Gluconobacter oxydans,15,16Komagataeibacter medellinensis (former Gluconacetobacter xylinus),17Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus,18,19 and Granulibacter bethesdensis.20 To establish a genetic platform for the features of AAB, many draft genomes of unique AAB species have been published, such as Acetobacter pomorum and Asaia platycodi isolated from insect guts,21,22 as well as the methylotroph AAB, Acidomonas methanolica.23To elucidate genes associated with the unique biochemical capabilities of As. bogorensis and release its genetic information for further analyses of its pathogenic strains, we here determined the complete genome sequence of a type strain of As. bogorensis, NBRC 16594, which is a natural but not clinical isolate. Its gene content was compared with those of other AAB genomes, and the As. bogorensis transcriptome was compared under different culture conditions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingAsaia bogorensis strain NBRC 16594 (=NRIC 0311 = JCM 10569) was obtained from the NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC, Japan). The genomic DNA sequence of As. bogorensis was determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy, using a method described previously with slight modifications.23 Briefly, 4.2 µg of genomic DNA was extracted from As. bogorensis that was cultured aerobically in a YPGD medium (1.0% yeast extract, 1.0% polypeptone, 2.0% glycerol, and 0.5% glucose) at 30°C. After DNA fragmentation and isolation (average fragment length 189 bp), 6,345,662 reads (75 bases per read) were generated using the GAIIx sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Short DNA reads were assembled using the Velvet 1.0.3 software. Among different k-mers (minimum-overlapping length) that were tested, 49 k-mer in size provided the best result in terms of N50, resulting in 50 contigs, with a total of 3,173,055 bp (coverage: 116×). Seventy-two primers were prepared based on relatively longer 36 contigs out of the 50 ones, and DNA amplification by PCR was performed using all combinations of both ends of the contigs. DNA sequences of the fragments amplified were determined at least once in both strands by direct sequencing of PCR products using an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). After all the gaps were filled with appropriate qualities, assembling of the genome DNA was validated by gel electrophoresis of its genomic DNA and re-mapping of the short DNA reads, resulted in no inconsistency in the assembling. No plasmids were detected in this process.2.2. Gene finding and annotationProtein-coding gene finding was performed using three programmes: GeneMarkS,24 MetaGeneAnnotator,25 and GLIMMER3.26 Protein-coding genes are defined when genomic loci were predicted as protein-coding genes (i) by two or more programmes, or (ii) by only one programme but supported by TIGRFAMs hits,27 or by distinctive RNA expression. The start positions of the genes were determined in two ways: (i) the same position was predicted as a start position by two or more programmes, or (ii) when all three programmes differently predicted start positions, the preferred was chosen from the software in the following order: GeneMarkS, MetaGeneAnnotator, and GLIMMER3. Prediction of rRNA and tRNA genes was performed using RNAmmer28 and tRNAscan-SE,29 respectively. Gene products were annotated on the basis of similar proteins of Am. methanolica23 and Ko. medellinensis,17 or most similar proteins in databases using the BLASTP program,30 as well as referring to conserved protein families that were predicted using the Hmmer3 program31 with a noise cut-off option (--cut_nc) against TIGRFAMs27 and PFAM32 databases.2.3. Bioinformatics analysesTo analyse a taxonomic distribution of specific genes, a platform phylogenetic tree with whole prokaryotic organisms was illustrated using 42 single-copy genes conserved among As. bogorensis and the complete genome sequences of 705 prokaryotic species representing 705 different genera, including 80 archaea and 625 bacteria, using a previously described method (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).33,34 The 42 genes were selected on the basis of the following two requirements: (i) the gene should be conserved among >95% of both archaea and bacteria and (ii) average copy numbers of the gene in both archaea and bacteria should be 1.10 or lower. The 42 gene products were aligned by MAFFT35 and concatenated, and phylogenetic distances of the species were then calculated using the FastTree program.36Phylogenetic profiles were constructed by allocation of each gene in whole genomes of six AAB, including As. bogorensis, Gr. bethesdensis, Ac. pasteurianus, Go. oxydans, Ko. medellinensis, and Ga. diazotrophicus, to a certain gene family at the amino acid level using the Hmmer3 program31 on TIGRFAMs27 and PFAM32 databases. To predict functional and evolutionary interactions among gene families, the gene families were classified into categories, such as gene families existing in only As. bogorensis but not in the other five AAB, ones in only pathogenic AAB (As. bogorensis and Gr. bethesdensis), and ones shared with AAB isolated from natural samples by a mean in which not only the presence or absence of a protein family, but also the copy number of paralogous genes in each AAB genome belonging to a protein family was considered.37 Statistical significance of this categorization was assessed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which takes into account the magnitude of the observed differences.2.4. Total RNA preparationAsaia bogorensis was grown under three different conditions. For cells prepared under ‘co-culture conditions’, HEK293 cells (Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells) and McCoy cells (mouse fibroblast cells) were pre-cultured in 2 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium F-12 (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) with 5% foetal calf serum (FCS, Cansera) without antibiotics in six-well plates until 60% confluence was achieved. Asaia bogorensis was cultured in YPGD at 30°C until OD600 = 1.0, and was then diluted 10 times with DMEM with 5% FCS (no antibiotics) and incubated at 37°C with vigorous shaking at 200 rpm until OD600 = 1.0 (~1 day). The supernatant of the mammalian cells were exchanged with 2 ml of the pre-cultured As. bogorensis, and the co-culture was incubated at 37°C for 8 h at 5% CO2 without agitation. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the mammalian cells were removed from the culture. Bacterial cells were then collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 25°C for 5 min at 17,860 × g. For cells prepared under ‘tissue culture conditions’, 2 ml of the pre-cultured As. bogorensis was added to a six-well plate without mammalian cells, and the cells were treated in the same way as cells prepared under ‘co-culture conditions’. As a control condition (‘AAB condition’), As. bogorensis cells were cultured in YPGD at 30°C with aeration at 200 rpm until OD600 = 1.0 was achieved.2.5. Transcriptome analysisTotal RNA was isolated from the bacterial cells using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA), and sequenced using HiSeq2000 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocols, with the exception of a treatment to decrease a copious amount of cDNA derived from rRNA using a duplex-specific nuclease.38 After base calling and quality filtering using CASAVA (Illumina), the sequence was mapped to the As. bogorensis genomic DNA sequence and processed using the Bowtie39 and SAMtools software package.40 The number of reads that were mapped for each gene was calculated using the BedTools software.41 Reads that were mapped to 16S and 23S rRNA genes were omitted from further analyses. Genes that were differentially expressed between two sets of samples were estimated using the edgeR package42 after normalization using the TCC package.43 For cells that were treated under ‘co-culture conditions’, four samples (two samples containing HEK293 and two samples containing McCoy cells) were prepared from independent cultures. Adjustments of false discovery rates for P-values were performed for multiple comparisons using a multi-test correction. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R statistical package. After data averaging and normalization, Reads per kilobase gene per million reads (RPKM) values were used for graphical presentations.3. Results3.1. General featuresThe complete genome sequence of As. bogorensis NBRC 16594 consisted of a single, circular chromosome of 3,198,265 bp with a GC content of 59.8% without plasmids (Table 1 and Fig. 1). In general, the As. bogorensis genome showed similar features to other complete genomes of AAB (Table 1). However, As. bogorensis and another AAB, which is also a human pathogen, Gr. bethesdensis, shared a few interesting traits, including a lack of plasmids and few transposase genes in the genomes (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis based on 42 concatenated prokaryotic universal genes illustrated a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) similar to the one based on the 16S rRNA genes.5 Therefore, As. bogorensis is closely related to Go. oxydans 621H, but distant from Gr. bethesdensis, suggesting that pathogenicity and the common traits of As. bogorensis and Gr. bethesdensis independently evolved during the evolutionary adaptation of the two AAB.

Scale bar indicates substitutions per amino acid residue (change/amino acid site).3.2. Characteristic genes in the As. bogorensis genomeTo clarify the characteristic genes, especially potentially pathogenic genes (described as pathogenic genes below), data from the phylogenetic profiles were used (Supplementary Table S3). Several genes are likely to be associated with pathogenicity of As. bogorensis in the gene families of only two pathogenic AAB (As. bogorensis and Gr. bethesdensis), and in three AAB able to habitat in eukaryotic organisms (As. bogorensis, Gr. bethesdensis, and Ga. diazotrophicus; Table 2). For example, As. bogorensis and Gr. bethesdensis contained genes encoding a large adhesin protein and its associated haemolysin activator protein, peroxidase genes, catalase genes, and antibiotic-resistant genes (beta-lactamases and penicillin amidase), as well as a type II secretion system. The type II secretion system and the large adhesin family genes are prevalent among a wide range of animal and plant pathogens.46,47 Interestingly, the As. bogorensis genome contained two complete operons for the bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase, which is described below (see Section 3.4). The As. bogorensis genome also uniquely contained an operon with two genes that were homologous to rhodopsin and beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase, which may function as a light-driven ion pump and produce a retinal cofactor of rhodopsin, respectively. Asaia bogorensis and Ko. medellinensis are known to produce cellulose fibres,17,48 and both contained a cellulose synthase bcs operon (synonyms: cel and ces) composed of bcsAB, bcsC, and bcsD genes (Asbog_01433–Asbog_01431). Those operons were classified into the gene families conserved in only As. bogorensis and Ko. medellinensis (Supplementary Table S3A).

Transcriptome analysisAsaia bogorensis and Am. methanolica have been reported as opportunistic human pathogens.8–10,12Asaia bogorensis NBRC 16594 and Am. methanolica NBRC104435 were shown to grow at 37°C under ‘tissue culture conditions’ (Supplementary Fig. S1).23 To identify As. bogorensis genes that contribute to its growth in human bodies, comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq was performed using As. bogorensis cultured under three different conditions: ‘co-culture conditions’, involving tissue culture at 37°C with mammalian cells, ‘tissue culture conditions’, involving the same culture conditions at 37°C but without mammalian cells, and in a YPGD medium at 30°C (‘AAB condition’). The results for ‘co-culture conditions’ and ‘tissue culture conditions’ showed high reproducibility for RNA-seq experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2). For the 2,833 genes of As. bogorensis, the expression of 101 and 78 genes was significantly higher and lower under ‘co-culture conditions’ than under the ‘AAB condition’, respectively (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4). Individual results for genes that encode terminal oxidases, primary dehydrogenases, genes that are unique to As. bogorensis, and genes related to stress responses are described below. Comparison of whole RNA-seq results of different culture conditions. RPKM values from RNA-seq analyses under the ‘AAB’ and ‘co-culture conditions’ were plotted as X–Y axes for each gene.

Genes for electron transport chainTwo complete operons of cyoABCD encoding bo3-type ubiquinol oxidases were identified in the As. bogorensis genome and assigned as cyoABCD-1 (Asbog_01765–Asbog_01762) and cyoABCD-2 (Asbog_00581–Asbog_00578) (Table 2 and Fig. 4A). Within 705 prokaryotic species that represent 705 different genera (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), 98 species contained cyoABCD genes, but only eight, besides As. bogorensis, contained two or more complete cyo operons. Most of the eight species are animal and plant pathogens or symbionts, including Bordetella bronchiseptica RB50, Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a, and Ralstonia solanacearum GMI100. Other AAB contained only one operon for the oxidase in each genome. The cyoABCD-1 operon belonged to a monophyletic clade formed by cyoABCD genes from the other AAB (Fig. 4B and C), whereas the cyoABCD-2 operon belonged to a clade composed of various Proteobacteria (Fig. 4B and D). Genes encoding haeme O synthase, cyoE, and assembly factor surf1 were not in the flanking regions for both operons. Cytochrome bo3-type ubiquinol oxidases.

The numbers indicate amino acid positions of Pseudomonas denitrificans cytochrome aa3 (PDB 1AR1).The structural and mutagenic studies performed on the bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase of Escherichia coli strongly suggest that the ubiquinol-binding site is in the transmembrane helices I and II, which contain a cluster of conserved polar residues in the subunit I, CyoB.49 Most of the residues conserved among ubiquinol oxidase CyoB were also conserved in both CyoB-1 and CyoB-2, except for three residues, 75E, 78V, and 102L, in CyoB-2 (Fig. 4E). Therefore, both CyoB-1 and CyoB-2 may be functional if those genes are expressed properly. Comparative transcriptome analysis indicated that As. bogorensis expressed lower levels of cyoABCD-1 under ‘co-culture conditions’ than under the ‘AAB condition’, whereas the opposite was true for cyoABCD-2 (Figs 3 and 5A). The results indicate that cyoABCD-1 and cyoABCD-2 could contribute to growth in the tissue culture condition by altering the expressions. Gene expression in different conditions. (A) Ten genes that encode subunits of terminal oxidases. (B) Five heat shock genes. In every panel, lanes 1–5 indicate various conditions (lanes 1 and 2, co-culture with HEK293; lanes 3 and 4, co-culture with McCoy; lane 5, ‘tissue culture condition’; lane 6, ‘AAB condition’), and vertical axis shows values of RPKM.Gene expression in different conditions.

Expression of E. coli cyd genes is upregulated under an oxygen-limited condition, so that the organism can survive under oxygen starvation conditions.50Asaia bogorensis also has cydAB of cytochrome bd oxidase that belongs to the subfamily of cyanide-insensitive terminal quinol oxidases. In contrast, expression levels of As. bogorensis cyd genes were relatively consistent under the different conditions (Fig. 5A).Asaia bogorensis and three other AAB, such as Ac. pasteurianus, Ko. medellinensis, and Gr. bethesdensis, contain one nuo operon for type I NADH dehydrogenases (Complex I), whereas Ga. diazotrophicus contains two, and Go. oxydans does not contain any. The phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated amino acid sequences encoded by six-well-conserved nuo genes (nuoHIJKLN) indicated that nuo operon of As. bogorensis and one operon of Ga. diazotrophicus formed a clade that was distinctive from one composed by nuo operons of Ac. pasteurianus, Ko. medellinensis, Gr. bethesdensis, and the other operon of Ga. diazotrophicus (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together with the phylogenetic analysis presented in Fig. 2, it appears that As. bogorensis and Ga. diazotrophicus gained an extra nuo gene, possibly by the horizontal gene transfer, and As. bogorensis and Go. oxydans lost one nuo operon that is common among AAB.The As. bogorensis genome included three more operons for the electron transport: ndh (type II NADH-dehydrogenase [NDH-2]), sdh (membrane-associated FAD-dependent succinate dehydrogenase [complex II]), and atp (an F1F0-type ATP synthase [complex V]) operons. Expression of the nuo, sdh, and atp operons were relatively lower under ‘co-culture conditions’ than under the ‘AAB condition’, whereas ndh expression was higher under ‘co-culture conditions’ than the ‘AAB condition’ (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. S4A). These results regarding sdh operon differed from a previous report7 that showed no activities were detected. It suggests that production of complex II is too low to detect biochemical activity, or that genetically it lost its function.3.5. Membrane-associated primary dehydrogenasesAAB genomes contain several genes that encode membrane-associated quinone reductases coupling substrate oxidation with quinone reduction (primary dehydrogenases).16,23Asaia bogorensis genome included genes for six membrane-associated primary dehydrogenases assigned based on subunit structures and amino acid sequences, i.e. SLDH1, GADH, GDH, GLDH, IDH (PQQ1), and LDH (Table 3).14,22 However, genes that encode membrane-associated ADH and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) were not found in the As. bogorensis genome. This result was consistent with reports that As. bogorensis does not oxidize ethanol to acetic acid.5,7Primary dehydrogenases in As. bogorensis NBRC 16594aQuinone reductases involved in oxidative fermentation are presented. Other quinone reductases that function in different processes are omitted from this table, such as FAD-dependent succinate dehydrogenase (Asbog_00368–Asbog_00371), FAD-dependent malate : quinone oxidoreductase (Asbog_01178), and proline dehydrogenase (Asbog_02561 and Asbog_00494).bFormer PQQ1 was biochemically determined to be inositol dehydrogenase.51Primary dehydrogenases in As. bogorensis NBRC 16594aQuinone reductases involved in oxidative fermentation are presented. Other quinone reductases that function in different processes are omitted from this table, such as FAD-dependent succinate dehydrogenase (Asbog_00368–Asbog_00371), FAD-dependent malate : quinone oxidoreductase (Asbog_01178), and proline dehydrogenase (Asbog_02561 and Asbog_00494).bFormer PQQ1 was biochemically determined to be inositol dehydrogenase.51The pyruvate oxidase operon (Asbog_02184–Asbog_02187) was unique to As. bogorensis and showed features conserved in membrane-associated primary dehydrogenases. Asbog_02184 encoded thiamin- and FAD-binding dehydrogenase similar to a membrane-associated cytoplasmic protein, PoxB (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B).52 Asbog_02185 encoded a protein with seven transmembrane helices. Asbog_02186 encoded a protein with a domain of gluconate 2-dehydrogenase subunit 3 similar to FAD-binding small subunits of primary dehydrogenases, such as Asbog_00352 for sldh and Asbog_02524 for gadh. Asbog_02187 encoded a glucose-methanol-choline family oxidoreductase similar to FAD-binding large subunits of primary dehydrogenases, such as Asbog_00353 for sldh and Asbog_02525 for gadh. The pyruvate oxidase seems a membrane-associated primary dehydrogenase locating in periplasmic space. But, the possibility has not been excluded that the pyruvate oxidase localizes on the cytoplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane, because it is still very difficult to predict topological locations of proteins by bioinformatics approaches.Interestingly, the pyruvate oxidase operon was highly expressed under ‘co-culture conditions’ comparing with other two conditions, whereas gene expression levels of the other primary dehydrogenase were not altered under the three culture conditions (Supplementary Table S4 and Figs S4B and S5C). The expression profile of pyruvate oxidase operon was similar to one of cyo-2 under the three conditions (Fig. 5A). Alterations in gene expression for the pyruvate oxidase may be related to culturing statuses, such as nutrition, oxygen dissolved in media, and temperature, as well as interaction with mammalian cells; however, the functional implications of the alterations are unknown.The uncharacterized PQQ-containing oxidoreductase PQQ2 subfamily (e.g. GOX1969 and Asbog_01692) partially shares its structure with BamB, which is a lipoprotein component of the BAM (beta-barrel assembly machinery) complex and catalyses the essential process of assembling outer membrane proteins.53 Thus, proteins in the PQQ2 subfamily were omitted from a list of primary dehydrogenases in this work. Similarly, quinone reductases involved in processes other than oxidative fermentation were omitted from the data (Table 3), such as FAD-dependent succinate dehydrogenase (Asbog_00368–Asbog_00371), FAD-dependent malate : quinone oxidoreductase (Asbog_01178), and proline dehydrogenase (Asbog_02561 and Asbog_00494).3.6. Other co-culture responsive genesTo determine the most responsive genes for ‘co-culture conditions’, 30 genes that resulted in the highest expression (average RPKM =2,500) were selected for analysis out of 101 genes that were expressed significantly higher under ‘co-culture conditions’ than the ‘AAB condition’. Fifteen out of the 30 genes encoded hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. Interestingly, nine of the 15 hypothetical genes were relatively small (<450 bases), and eight out of the nine genes were unique to As. bogorensis (Fig. 3 and SupplementaryTable S4A). The mapping of the RNA-seq reads to genome regions with the 15 hypothetical genes resulted in independent peaks for monocistronic genes. Expression histograms of the nine short hypothetical genes are presented in Supplementary Fig. S6.In addition to these short hypothetical genes, there were six stress response genes in the 30 most responsive genes under ‘co-culture conditions’, including rpoH (Asbog_00611) for heat shock sigma factor Sigma32, and five genes for heavy-metal resistance domain protein (Asbog_00970), thioredoxin peroxidase (Asbog_01975), stress response protein, CsbD (Asbog_00532), cold shock transcriptional regulator (Asbog_02006), and a starvation-inducible DNA-binding protein/stationary phase protection protein, Dps (Asbog_00671). In contrast to the rpoH gene expression, groEL/groES (Asbog_01781 and Asbog_01782) and dnaJK (Asbog_02819 and Asbog_02818) were expressed significantly less under ‘co-culture conditions’ than under ‘AAB conditions’ (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Table S4B). This discordance of gene expression between rpoH and its prospected regulons is unknown at this time.4. DiscussionAsaia bogorensis is a unique member of AAB and was reported as an opportunistic pathogen that causes human peritonitis and bacteraemia. Here, we determined the complete genome sequence of an As. bogorensis type strain NBRC 16594, which was isolated from flowers and fruits. The comparative genome analyses with other complete genomes showed that the bacterium genome contained putative pathogenic genes, including genes encoding type II secretion system and large cell adhesin, and genes responsible for elimination of reactive oxygen species and antibiotics. The genome data may provide basic information for further characterization of As. bogorensis pathogenicity using clinical isolates.RNA-seq analyses using various culture conditions illuminated that expression of many short hypothetical genes, most of which are unique to As. bogorensis, were significantly higher under the ‘co-culture conditions’ with two types of mammal cells than under the ‘AAB condition’. It was previously reported that small proteins were involved in the adaptation to stressful environments,54,55 and thus those short hypothetical genes may response to stressors under the ‘co-culture conditions’. Expression levels of certain stress-responsive genes were also significantly high under the ‘co-culture conditions’, including genes encoding RpoH, CsbD, Dps, heavy-metal resistance domain proteins, thioredoxin peroxidase, and cold shock transcriptional regulator. Most of the AAB are mesophilic and can grow only at 35°C or below. But certain AAB species, including As. bogorensis and Ac. pasteurianus, could be adapted to higher temperature environments managing those stress-responsive genes. Asaia bogorensis increased gene expression of RpoH under the ‘co-culture conditions’. However, gene expression of the assumable regulon of RpoH, including typical heat shock protein (HSP) genes, groEL/groES and dnaJK, were significantly lower under ‘co-culture conditions’. Many reports showed that bacterial HSPs stimulate immune responses of their hosts and host cells produce proinflammatory cytokines leading to inflammation.56,57 The low expression of HSPs under the ‘co-culture conditions’ may provide a clue to understand how As. bogorensis avoids immunosurveillance and establishes chronic infection in human bodies.Two cyo operons were identified in the As. bogorensis genome and showed opposite expression profiles under different conditions. There are five draft genomes of Asaia species in the public database, including Asaia astilbis JCM 15831 (GCF_000613845.1), As. sp. SF2.1 (NCBI assembly ID GCF_000505765.1),58Asaia prunellae JCM 25354 (GCF_000613885.1), As. platycodi JCM 25414 (GCF_000614545.1), and As. platycodi SF2.1 (GCF_000724025.1).22 All Asaia species, except As. astilbis, have two cyo operons that correspond to cyoABCD-1 and cyoABCD-2. Asaia astilbis genome contained mutated cyoABCD-1 but no cyoABCD-2 operon. It may be because the draft genome DNA sequence was highly erroneous or because its mutation rate was high. Asaia species were identified in the gut and salivary gland of Anopheles stephensi, an Asian malarial mosquito vector.59,60 It is possible that generation of the two cyo operons in an Asaia ancestor was a key evolutionary event that led to the survival in a variety of environments, including high temperature conditions and inside of multicellular organisms. Besides As. bogorensis, only 8 species among 705 prokaryotic species contained two or more complete cyo operons, and most of the species are animal and plant pathogens or symbionts. Further analyses are required to clarify the evolutionary relationship among those species and the meaning of the gene expression alteration.In conclusion, complete genome sequencing, genome comparison with other bacteria, and transcriptome analysis of As. bogorensis identified genes that may confer the ability to survive in various and changing environments.Accession numbersThe accession number of the genome sequence and the BioProject ID of As. bogorensis NBRC 16594 reported in this paper is DDBJ:AP014690.1 and PRJDB519, respectively.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.orgFundingThis work was financially supported by the Advanced Low Carbon Technology Research and Development Program (ALCA), and a grant-in-aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (KAKEN-HI: 22510222).

Localizing the SDR will expedite the discovery of genes controlling carpel abortion in males and pollen sterility in females.1. IntroductionKiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis Planchon) is one of the most recently domesticated specialty fruit crops and is currently grown commercially worldwide. The genus Actinidia (2n = 2x = 58 chromosomes) comprises 54 species and 75 taxa in total, and most of these species occur naturally in China.1 Most commercial cultivars were developed from a narrow pool of A. chinensis germplasm, and the current lack of genetic diversity makes kiwifruit vulnerable to new diseases and hinders cultivar improvement. The underexplored wild Actinidia germplasm has a wide range of desirable fruit characteristics and high potential for developing new kiwifruit cultivars. Interspecific hybridization is a proved approach to combine desirable traits from different species and surmount obstacles of paternal selection of dioecious plants, for example, ‘Jinyan’, a new cultivar bred by interspecific hybridization between Actinidia eriantha and A. chinensis, has excellent storage quality which is attributed to A. eriantha.2The vast majority of flowering plants, including most crop plants, are hermaphroditic, but a small portion (6%) are dioecious with separate male and female plants. Dioecy likely evolves from hermaphrodite or monoecious ancestors by two mutations with the first causing male sterility and the second reducing female fertility.3 Dioecy can be controlled by individual gene (e.g. cucumis),4 or fully developed sex-specific regions or sex chromosomes as observed in papaya,5 pistachio,6 strawberry,7 and the model plant Silene.8 Kiwifruit is a functionally dioecious plant. Females bear flowers that are hermaphroditic in appearance but produce empty pollen, and male flowers have a rudimentary carpel that aborts before style elongation. Because it is dioecious, kiwifruit has an inevitable disadvantage in breeding; paternal parents are selected with unknown fruit quality since male plants cannot bear fruit.9 In a typical cross population, male plants represent 50% of the progeny that are a waste of breeding land and resources.10,11 In interspecific breeding programmes for dioecious plants, high-density genetic linkage maps of both maternal and paternal species are one of the most important tools for mapping important agricultural traits and marker assistant selection. However, few interspecific kiwifruit genetic maps have been generated, except a map constructed using microsatellite and amplified fragments length polymorphism (AFLP) markers from a cross between A. chinensis and Actinidia callosa.12 The sex-determination region (SDR) was mapped to a linkage group in A. callosa, but the relatively low marker density limited the practical use of marker-assisted selection or map-based gene cloning in the interspecific kiwifruit breeding programmes. Subsequently, more saturated genetic maps of A. chinensis were constructed with 644 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers, and two sex-linked sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers (SmX and SmY) were mapped to a shared linkage group.13,14 The SDR in kiwifruit was mapped to the subtelomere of LG17 using sex-specific SCAR markers,13 which corresponded to 25 chromosome (Supplementary Table S1). However, scoring the sex-specific markers SmX and SmY in a population of Actinidia rufa × A. chinensis revealed that they were not robust and amplified poorly across species which limited their utility for breeding. Sex-linked markers can reduce the time, labour, and costs associated with breeding programmes, and facilitate dissecting the sex-determination system.6 Recently, a high-density genetic map based on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was constructed between A. chinensis ‘Hongyang-MS-01’ (male) and A. chinensis × A. eriantha cv. ‘Jiangshanjiao’ (female) to order scaffolds in the kiwifruit draft genome assembly.15 However, ~25% of the scaffolds are currently unanchored to the chromosome scale assembly.Traditionally genotyping methods were expensive and labour intensive; recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have provided new opportunities for detecting a large number of DNA markers rapidly. Restriction-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing can produce dominant markers within the restriction sites and co-dominant markers adjacent to the restriction sites.16 Detection of DNA polymorphisms using next-generation RAD sequencing (RAD-seq) is efficient and requires no prior genome sequence knowledge for the species under investigation. Linkage maps for insects,17 fungi,18 and plants19 have been constructed using RAD-seq, with broad applications in most model and non-model organisms.20,21 Recently, sex-linked SNP markers in pistachio were identified through RAD-seq in an F1 segregating population, which was beneficial to cost-effective marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes.6 Here, we present high-density interspecific kiwifruit genetic maps based on SNP markers using RAD-seq. The high-density genetic maps are beneficial for kiwifruit breeding programmes and improving the kiwifruit draft genome assembly. The three sex-related markers developed in the SDR can accurately distinguish male and female plants, which can be utilized in kiwifruit breeding and commercial production for marker-assisted selection for sex.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and DNA isolationAn F1 mapping population was generated by crossing A. rufa ‘MT570001’ and A. chinensis ‘Guihai No4’, and 174 F1 individuals consisting of 87 male progeny and 87 female progeny were selected for genotyping and mapping. Young leaf tissue of the parents and F1 individuals was harvested for genomic DNA extraction using the modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.222.2. RAD library preparation and sequencingA reduced representation restriction-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing method was used for library construction following the protocol outlined in Zhang et al.23 In brief, genomic DNA (1 µg) from each sample was digested for 15 min at 37°C in a 50 ml reaction with 20 units (U) of EcoRI (NEB, USA), which recognized a six-nucleotide sequence (5'G/AATTC3'). A modified Illumina P1 adapter containing specific nucleotide barcodes 4–8 bp long was using for sample tracking. After adapter ligation, individual libraries were pooled to equimolar concentrations with the exception of the parents which had 3× representation. DNA fragments were randomly sheared (Bioruptor Branson sonicator 450) to an average size of 500 bp, and sheared DNA fragments were run out on a 1% agarose gel (Sigma). DNA fragments in the range of 300–500 bp were isolated using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The dsDNA ends end repaired, a 3'-adenine overhangs were added, and a modified Illumina P2 adapter was ligated. Finally, DNA products were PCR-amplified using Phusion Master Mix (NEB, USA), with 4 µM modified Solexa amplification primer mix (Illumina, USA) for 18 cycles. DNA library was sequenced by using the Illumina Hiseq2000 instrumentation.2.3. SNP discovery and genotypingRaw sequence reads were segregated by barcodes assigned to individuals and low-quality reads, and those that lacked a correct barcode were removed.24 The reads were first assigned to each individual by the unambiguous barcodes, and the reads without the unique barcodes were discarded. Reads were quality-filtered by discarding adapter pollutions and the reads containing >50% low-quality bases (quality value of =5) were removing. The quality-filtered RAD reads of each individual were mapped onto the kiwifruit repeat masked genome (Kiwifruit_pseudomolecule.masked.fa)15 with the alignment software SOAP2.25 Based on the alignment result, the RAD-based SNP calling was done by SOAPsnp.26 To minimize errors in calling markers, the consensus alignments with <5 or >100 sequences were discarded. Polymorphic markers between maternal and paternal parents were identified by pairwise grouping with a copy number of =1.5. The ratio of marker segregation was calculated by the <U+03C7>2 test and markers showing significantly distorted segregation (P-value <0.01) were excluded from the map construction.2.4. Construction of linkage mapsFor linkage analysis, the double pseudo-test cross strategy was applied.27 The flower sex phenotype was mapped as a dominant marker ‘Sex-f’. The RAD-seq markers with >20% missing data were removed, then the ‘Sex-f’ marker and the remaining high-quality RAD-seq markers were used to construct a genetic map using the JoinMap 4.0 software with cross pollinated population type codes.28 The female and male linkage maps were created by maternal and paternal population nodes, respectively. Markers were assigned to linkage groups with an independence log-of-odds (LOD) score of 8.0. The genetic distances between loci and the recombination rate were calculated with Kosambi's function and the regression mapping algorithm with a recombination frequency threshold of 0.5. Markers that were physically within 100 kb of each other in the two parental maps were used to assess marker co-linearity between the maps. The markers between two parental genetic maps were linked using custom perl scripts, and Circos was used to visualize the collinearity of two parental maps.2.5. Sex-related markers screening and verificationThe assembled kiwifruit genome sequence and gene annotation were downloaded from the GenBank nucleotide core database.15 The MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA) program was used to identify microsatellite markers in the kiwifruit scaffolds, and dimers to hexamers of at least 22 bp in length were selected; primers were designed based on flank sequence using Primer 3 program. All 40 SSR markers in genic regions were screened in 10 male and 10 female plants from the mapping population, then sex-specific markers were validated by screening against the 174 F1 individuals and further tested in another population and 6 A. chinensis (‘Hongyang’, ‘Cuiyu’, ‘Guihai’, ‘Huaguang No2’, ‘QS-14’, and ‘QS-5’) and 3 A. rufa (‘Shanli 3’, ‘Shanli 4’, and ‘Shanli 5’) germplasm accessions. The PCR products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Candidate sex-determination genes were annotated using BLAST with a minimum e-value of 1e-04.3. Results3.1. RAD-seq and SNP discoveringA total of 176 RAD-seq libraries of two parents (A. rufa ‘MT570001’ and A. chinensis ‘Guihai No4’) and their 174 F1 offspring were constructed and sequenced using the Illumina HigSeq 2000 platform. After data trimming and filtering, 2,658 million clean reads remained, representing ~231 Gb of sequences. The RAD-seq reads were deposited at NCBI with accession number PRJNA290688 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/290688). RAD reads were sorted by individual based on the barcode information. The parental libraries had a combined 118 million filtered reads, and the 174 F1 offspring have a total of 2,540 million filtered reads with an average of 14.6 million reads per progeny. Among sequencing reads, 53.81% reads were mapped to the reference genome, and unique reads accounted for 92.94% of mapping reads. Most of the unmapped reads likely corresponded to repeat regions which were masked in the reference genome to prevent erroneous marker calls. The average sequencing depths of sequenced loci per parent and progeny were 30.35 and 20.25 fold, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). RAD tags from each individual were clustered and called for SNP markers after stringent selection following the protocol described in the Materials and Methods section. In total, 6,783 high-confidence SNPs across the 174 offspring were generated, including 2,479 heterozygous SNPs in A. rufa ‘MT570001’ and 4,304 heterozygous SNPs in A. chinensis ‘Guihai No4’.3.2. Construction of the high-density genetic mapsWe constructed two high-density genetic maps from an interspecific cross of A. rufa ‘MT570001’ ×A. chinensis ‘Guihai No4’ using JoinMap 4.0, with an independence LOD score of 8.0. The A. rufa ‘MT570001’ (maternal) map consists of 2,426 SNP markers in 29 linkage groups (LGs) corresponding to the 29 haploid chromosomes. The marker names and positions for all loci in the 29 LGs of genetic map are listed in Supplementary Table S3. The total length of the A. rufa map is 2651.3 cM with an average distance of 1.09 cM between adjacent markers, and the genetic length for each LG ranged from 67.3 to 122.5 cM (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The A. chinensis ‘Guihai No4’ (paternal) map consists of 4,214 SNP markers in 29 LGs. The locus name and genetic map position for all SNP loci in the 29 LGs of genetic map are listed in Supplementary Table S4. The total length of the A. chinensis map is 3,142.4 cM with an average distance of 0.75 cM between adjacent markers, with linkage groups ranging from 72.4 to 151.7 cM in size (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The ‘Sex-f’ marker was mapped to the telomere of LG25 in A. chinensis map. It is notable that a few markers mapped on linkage groups were not located on the corresponding chromosomes compared with the kiwifruit draft genome.15Summary of mapping result in A. rufa and A. chinensis genetic mapsSummary of mapping result in A. rufa and A. chinensis genetic mapsThe linkage groups of A. rufa.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The high quality and density of the genetic maps allowed us to anchor and orient a number of scaffolds, which were previously unanchored in the kiwifruit draft genome. Among unmapped scaffolds, 228 scaffolds were anchored by 694 markers from A. rufa map, and 373 scaffolds were anchored by 1,187 markers from A. chinensis map. In total, 440 newly anchored genome scaffolds with 101 Mb were covered by the markers of the two genetic maps. The scaffold information of markers allowed us to assess the collinearity and accuracy of the genetic maps as well as integration of the two maps. The markers used to access collinearity were based on physical distances, including those mapped on conflicting chromosomes. The kiwifruit genetic maps are largely collinear, with all 29 LGs having shared scaffolds or genome sequences between the two maps (Figs 3 and 4 and Table 2).

Sex-specific marker identification and localization of the SDRThe subtelomeric region of chromosome 25 (0–5 Mb) was confirmed to be the SDR based on the physical position of markers close to ‘Sex-f’, consistent with the previous findings of Fraser et al. A total of 1,095 SSR markers in position 0–5 Mb were identified by MISA following the criteria outlined in the Materials and methods section. The SSR markers were thinned to eight per Mb and 40 genic SSR markers were screened. All 40 SSR markers in the 0–5 Mb region were screened in 10 male and 10 female plants from the mapping population, of which 12 SSR markers were polymorphic in 20 lines tested, and only three SSR markers presented distinct bands for sex identification (Table 3). The three sex-specific markers were further validated by screening against the 174 F1 individuals, and the results showed that they could clearly distinguish male and female individuals, respectively. A001 amplifies a 202-bp fragment in female individuals with no product in male individuals, and A002 and A003 produce diverse bands between the male and female plants. Furthermore, the three sex-specific SSR markers were validated in another set of individuals crossed by A. rufa and A. chinensis, and also in 6 A. chinensis (‘Hongyang’, ‘Cuiyu’, ‘Guihai’, ‘Huaguang No2’, ‘QS-14’, and ‘QS-5’) and 3 A. rufa (‘Shanli 3’, ‘Shanli 4’, and ‘Shanli 5’) germplasm accessions. All three markers can be used to accurately sex type in another interspecific cross. The A003 marker could distinguish all A. chinensis and A. rufa samples, and A001 marker could identify A. rufa plants, and combining A001 and A002 could also be used to sex type all A. chinensis and A. rufa samples. The positions of three SSR markers were located in 1–2 Mb on chromosome 25, which narrowed down the SDR to this 1 Mb region. The genotypes of three SSR markers were added to the database for grouping and mapping to the linkage group. All three SSR markers were closely adjacent to sex-determination locus, and the minimum genetic distance between ‘sex-f’ and SSR marker is 0.9 cM (Supplementary Fig. S1).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The SDR region is subtelomeric and has a much lower gene density than the genome-wide average with mere 150 genes across the 5-Mb region. Despite the low gene density, the SDR region is enriched for genes involved in reproduction and it contains several candidate sex-determination genes. Among these are Achn342721, a homologue to FBL17 in Arabidopsis with an e-value of 8e-04, which is essential for male fertility and germ line proliferation29 and Achn226501, a homologue of Caleosin, which is involved in lipid storage in maturing seeds with an e-value of 1e-79.4. DiscussionAlthough a number of AFLP markers were developed to create linkage map for anchoring genome scaffolds,30 screening traditional non-informative DNA markers, such as AFLP, RAPD, and ISSR, is a labour intensive, expensive, and low-throughput process that is unsuitable for aiding in the genome assembly. Fortunately, the advent of RAD-seq has overcome these problems, providing a cost-effective, high-throughput, automated protocol for identifying SNP markers. Using this method, a genetic map of kiwifruit was constructed to aid in the kiwifruit genome assembly using an F1 population of A. chinensis.15 Except for A. chinensis, few genetic and genomic resources are available for other Actinidia species which are especially problematic, given the limited diversity of useful kiwifruit germplam. Actinidia rufa native to China, Korea, and Japan is characterized by disease resistance, high yield, excellent storage, and other numerous good fruit traits. The high-density genetic map of A. rufa presented here is a useful prerequisite for quantitative trait locus mapping and marker-assisted breeding to facilitate identification of new desirable traits.The A. chinensis genetic map had a higher marker density than the A. rufa map, with 4,215 markers in 29 linkage groups, spanning 3,142.4 cM. In comparison, the A. rufa map contained 2,426 markers with 29 linkage groups spanning over 2,651.3 cM. The higher marker density suggests that A. chinensis may have higher within genome heterozygosity than A. rufa. The lower nucleotide diversity in A. rufa is likely because it naturally occurs in a narrow geographic area (Taiwan in China, Korea, and Japan), which probably has an independent evolutionary and geographic origin. Moreover, A. rufa may have more sequence divergence that would result in fewer shared restriction sites and thus less mapable markers obtained. The accuracy of genetic maps can be estimated by comparing the collinearity between the two maps. Comparison of marker positions between the two maps revealed a high degree of collinearity; almost all 29 linkage groups are collinear on corresponding chromosomes between both maps, which positively supported the reliability of marker order in genetic maps.Owing to large population size and high sequencing depth, abundant SNP markers were developed in a high-density genetic map, which was greatly beneficial to the kiwifruit genome assembly. Population size is a strong confounding factor of LD measurement, smaller populations have less variation, and lower recombination rates could be detected.31 We constructed a high-density genetic map using an interspecific population with 174 individuals, 1.6 times more than those (108 individuals) employed for map construction in previous research.15 The significant genetic differences between parents and large size of the population facilitated to identify more SNPs. Moreover, the average sequencing depth of sequenced loci per progeny in these maps is 20.25 fold, almost two times more than that (10.73 fold) in Huang's study. In the previous map, SNP calling and genotyping were mainly depended on the parental data due to lack of a kiwifruit reference genome, which limited the number of useful markers. The previous mean marker density is 1.28 cM per marker, and 3,379 markers were aligned to the assembled scaffolds.15 By comparison, we generated 2,426 and 4,214 SNP markers in the maternal and paternal maps with average marker distance 1.09 and 0.75 cM, respectively. The higher marker density allowed some previously unmapped scaffolds to be anchored. Roughly 440 unmapped scaffolds from the kiwifruit reference genome totalling 101 Mb were anchored to chromosomes; 228 and 373 unmapped scaffolds were anchored on A. rufa and A. chinensis map, respectively. The new anchored scaffolds considerably improved the kiwifruit genome assembly.It is notable that a few markers mapped on linkage groups were differed with the corresponding assembled chromosomes. Multiple-clustered markers on chromosome 6 and chromosome 5 were re-mapped on linkage groups (chromosomes) 19 and 21 on both parental maps, which reconfirmed the high reliability of the genetic maps. It is possible that entire scaffolds were misplaced, which is common in draft genome assemblies.32 We assumed that scaffolds were assembled correctly, then interchromosomal rearrangement appeared in both A. chinensis (paternal) and A. rufa (maternal). Thus, it is contradictory that interchromosomal rearrangement occurred in interspecific A. rufa and A. chinensis, rather than the intraspecific A. chinensis cv. ‘Guihai No4’ and A. chinensis cv. ‘Hongyang’ genome. Much higher synteny with interspecific plants than intraspecific plants suggested that it was likely assembly errors rather than true genomic rearrangements.33 Moreover, if genome interchromosomal rearrangement was so rampant, we would expect to detect at least one between A. rufa and A. chinensis. Genome assemblies were imperfect and genomic rearrangements seem to be more common than they really are due to assembly errors.34 Upon integrating physical and genetic maps of the apple, homoeologous chromosome pairs and multiple locus markers on the same chromosome were detected.35 These genome-wide and segmental duplications in the genome were likely to cause assembly errors. Besides assembly errors, some inconsistencies among marker positions were attributed either to structural variations within the genome or among mapping populations, or genotyping technical errors.36 The kiwifruit genome could be considerably improved by means of correcting misplaced scaffolds and increasing new anchored scaffolds.Roughly 6% of flowering plants are dioecious with separate male and female plants, and dioecy has evolved independently numerous times.37 Dioecy can be controlled by simple mechanisms such as a single gene with two independent mutations or more complex mechanisms such as sex chromosomes. Two sex-determinant genes were mapped on a common linkage group in wild strawberry, and recombination between them resulted in male, female, hermaphrodite, and neuter progeny.38 Kiwifruit has an SDR that behaves like an XY chromosome pair with presumably two linked genes controlling sex.14,39 One gene likely controls carpel abortion which happens near inception in male flowers and the second gene controls pollen sterility as female flowers produce empty pollen grains.40 The sex-related marker ‘Sex-f’ was mapped on the telomere of LG25 in male map, while failed to map on female map. The similar results appeared on kiwifruit maps using AFLP markers in A. chinensis×A. callosa and using SSR markers in A. chinensis × A. chinensis due to the gap in female map or the low recombination of sexual chromosomes.12,13 We constructed the higher density female genetic map with the average marker distance of 0.69 cM in LG25; therefore, it is possible that recombination suppression led to no markers mapping on the female sex chromosome.We produced three additional SSR markers in the SDR that can be used to accurately sex type male and female plants, which has both commercial and breeding applications. The SCAR markers, SmX and SmY, were available to identify sex type in A. chinensis, but had limited use in sex typing interspecific seedlings. The SCAR markers relied on more specific sequences, which usually cause the failure of interspecific amplification, whereas SSR markers in the genic region were more stable than SCAR marker because of gene conservation. Three sex-related SSR markers were selected on genes in 0–5 Mb on chromosome 25; their predicted function was RNA-binding protein, oxidoreductase, and Ribosome-recycling factor, respectively (Table 3). Because of its subtelomeric position, the SDR is remarkably gene poor and contains 150 genes over the ~5 Mb region. SDR regions in plants tend to be pericentric as is the case of papaya41 or telomeric as seen in poplar,42 as these regions typically have lower rates of recombination which allows the fixation of sex-determination loci. The SDR in kiwifruit has several genes, which may be involved in sex determination including a homologue of FBL17 in Arabidopsis, which is essential for male fertility and germ line proliferation.29 Mapping the SDR region will help expedite the discovery of the sex-determination genes in kiwifruit, which will allow the development of true breeding hermaphrodite varieties.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants no. 31301749) and Wuhan Applied Basic Research Project (2015020101010075).

IntroductionChickpea [Cicer arietinum (L.)] is a self-pollinated annual diploid legume with a genome size of ~740 Mb.1–3 Globally, chickpea is the third most important food legume complementing cereals and considered a vital human dietary source of protein abundant in essential amino acids.2,3 In the present era of climatic variability, resource scarcity and fast-growing population, it is necessary to enhance productivity as well as sustainability of agriculture for circumventing the global food insecurity. The prime objective of chickpea genomics-assisted breeding was thus inclined towards developing high-yielding durable stress tolerant (climate resilient) chickpea cultivars to meet the dietary demand of increasing population for attaining food security. To achieve these goals, an effective molecular dissection of these complex quantitative stress tolerance and yield-contributing traits by identification (map-based cloning) of potential trait-associated genes/quantitative trait loci (QTLs) through genetic/association mapping and their deployment in marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea is essential. Significant progress in this regard has been made primarily through development and high-throughput genotyping of numerous genome/gene-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in diverse natural and mapping populations to expedite the process of genetic and association mapping in chickpea.4–12 Consequently, hitherto very limited number of markers tightly linked to genes/QTLs governing traits of agronomic importance has been identified to be exploited for marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea.13 Several studies have documented the narrow genetic base causing low intra-specific marker polymorphism as the major hindrance for chickpea genetic improvement.2,14 Henceforth, it is imperative to develop and use numerous genome-wide informative sequence-based genetic markers in generating high-density linkage maps and for high-resolution genetic and association mapping in order to delineate functionally relevant trait-regulatory genes/QTLs for genomics-assisted crop improvement of chickpea.Insertion-deletions (InDels) are one of the major sources of structural variation found widely distributed across the genomes of diverse plant species, including Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and tomato.15,16 InDels generally arise due to certain cellular mechanisms, including movement of transposable elements, replication slippage and unequal crossing-over within the genome.17 InDel is an important phenomenon, which can exert a deleterious as well as beneficial effect on particular loci within the genome.18,19 These InDels are valuable complement to other sequence-based genetic markers like SSRs and SNPs and well recognized as an effective marker system for genetic analysis in crop plants primarily due to myriad desirable inherent genetic attributes such as multi-allelic and co-dominant inheritance and wide genomic distribution. Besides, the InDel markers are easily detectable at a genome-wide scale (gene level) in silico with low cost, labor and time via comparison of freely accessible genomic (transcriptomic) sequence resources of different available genotypes through computational genomics tools. In addition to the user-friendly mining approach, these markers can be preferably selected on the basis of their predicted fragment length variations and further validated/genotyped in germplasm lines and mapping populations using a simple cost-effective agarose gel-based assay. This makes InDels an ideal marker system of choice for diverse genomics-assisted breeding applications in crop plants.15–17,20–23Much recently, the completion of genome sequencing of desi (cv. ICC 4958) and kabuli (cv. CDC Frontier) cultivars of chickpea has accelerated the process of genome resequencing of diverse desi, kabuli and wild accessions.2,14 It would be thus interesting to develop informative InDel markers in silico at a genome-wide scale by comparing these publicly accessible genomic (gene) sequences of different chickpea accessions with sub-optimal use of resources. Furthermore, the large-scale validation and genotyping of these developed InDel markers in natural germplasm lines and mapping populations with higher marker genetic polymorphic potential, could be utilized for construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps as well as molecular mapping and genetic association analysis in order to identify trait-regulating genes/QTLs for marker-assisted genetic enhancement of chickpea.In light of the above, the present study has made an effort to develop large-scale genome-wide InDel markers and to determine their genomic constitution in the chickpea genome. The potential of these markers was assessed to detect intra-specific polymorphism and genetic diversity among desi, kabuli and wild accessions, and construct high-density inter-specific genetic linkage map of chickpea. As a proof of concept, this InDel markers-based high-resolution genetic linkage map was utilized as a reference to identify and map the major genomic regions harboring robust QTLs governing flowering and maturity time, with an aim to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding in chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Discovery of genome-wide InDel markers in chickpeaThe high-quality FASTQ sequence reads generated from whole-genome resequencing of four chickpea accessions (desi cv. ICC 4958 and ICC 4951, kabuli cv. ICC 12968 and wild Cicer reticulatum cv. ICC 17160) were acquired.14,24 The mapping of sequence reads of three chickpea accessions onto the chromosome pseudomolecules of reference desi (ICC 4958) genome and detection of high-quality InDels among accessions were performed following Jain et al.20 A highly stringent criteria with a minimum read depth of 10 and a minimum sequence variant frequency (polymorphism call rate) of >85% as well as the presence of at least one InDel within a 50-bp window were considered relevant for screening and detection of high-quality (minimal false-positive) InDels among four chickpea accessions. About 200–300 bp high-quality genomic sequences of ICC 4958 flanking the either side of identified InDels were retrieved. The forward and reverse primers targeting these InDels-carrying sequences were designed using the generic primer interface of BatchPrimer3 (http://probes.pw.usda.gov/batchprimer3) to develop genome-wide InDel markers. The genomic distribution of InDel markers on chromosome pseudomolecules of desi chickpea genome was determined and visualized using Circos visualization tool.11 To determine the precise distribution of InDel markers in the diverse intergenic as well as coding and non-coding sequence components of genes/genomes (chromosomes/pseudomolecules and unanchored scaffolds), the physical positions (bp) of InDel markers were integrated/correlated with the GFF file containing genome annotation of desi chickpea (CGAP v1.014) using the customized Perl scripts. The putative function of InDel markers-carrying genes was predicted according to desi genome annotation14 and PFAM database v27.0 (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk).2.2. Experimental validation, polymorphism and genetic diversity potential of InDel markersTo assess the amplification and polymorphic potential of developed InDel markers, the InDel markers showing =10 bp in silico fragment length polymorphism among accessions were PCR amplified using the genomic DNA of 24 chickpea accessions. This included four accessions (ICC 4958, ICC 4951, ICC 12968 and ICC 17160) from which the InDel markers were originally identified, and 20 additional desi (9) and kabuli (11) accessions (Supplementary Table S1). The standard PCR constituents and touchdown thermal cycling profiling for PCR amplification and 2.5% agarose gel to resolve the amplified PCR products were utilized as per Kujur et al.10 For experimental validation of InDel markers revealing 2–9 bp in silico fragment length polymorphism among accessions, these markers were PCR amplified using the genomic DNA of 24 aforesaid chickpea accessions. The amplified PCR products were purified and sequenced in both forward and reverse directions twice on a capillary-based automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit. The high-quality consensus sequences obtained for each InDel marker were aligned and compared among accessions used. The genotyping data of validated InDel markers were utilized to estimate the average polymorphic alleles per marker, percent polymorphism and polymorphism information content (PIC) among chickpea accessions employing the PowerMarker v3.51.25 The genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among accessions were determined using the genotyping data of validated polymorphic genome/gene-derived InDel markers. The Nei and Li similarity coefficient-based neighbor joining (NJ) method (with 1,000 bootstrap replicates) of PowerMarker v3.51 was employed for clustering analysis and construction of unrooted phylogenetic tree among accessions.2.3. Genetic linkage map constructionThe InDel markers showing polymorphism between ICC 4958 and ICC 17160 were PCR amplified and genotyped using 190 individuals and parental accessions derived from an F5 inter-specific mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160), following the aforementioned methods of agarose gel- and PCR amplicons resequencing-based assays. The genotyping data were analyzed employing the <U+03C7>2-test (P < 0.05) to assess their goodness-of-fit to the expected Mendelian 1:1 segregation ratio. The MAPMAKER/EXP 3.026 was used to estimate linkage analysis among the InDel markers, basing upon which different linkage groups (LGs) were classified. For further validation of linkages among markers, the genotyping data of markers grouped by MAPMAKER were analyzed through JoinMap 4.1 (http://www.kyazma.nl/index.php/mc.JoinMap) at higher logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold (4.0–8.0) with Kosambi mapping function. The InDel markers were incorporated into defined LGs (designated LG1 to LG8) based on their centiMorgan (cM) genetic distances and corresponding marker physical positions (bp) on the chromosomes. An inter-specific genetic linkage map was finally constructed and visualized using MapChart v2.2.102.4. QTL mappingThe 190 individuals along with parental accessions of an inter-specific mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) were grown in the field for two consecutive years during crop-growing season at two diverse geographical locations of India. Additionally, greenhouse trial was performed to measure the flowering and maturity time response of mapping individuals under both long- and short-day conditions at 22 ± 2°C. The days to 50% flowering (DF) and maturity (DM) time of each mapping individual (10–12 representative plants from each individual) was measured by counting the number of days from sowing (first irrigation) to the stage when 50% of their plants have begun to flower and 90% of pods have matured and turned yellow, respectively. The homogeneity, frequency distribution, coefficient of variation (CV) and broad-sense heritability (H2) of DF and DM traits in mapping population were determined following Bajaj et al.27For QTL mapping, the genotyping data of InDel markers physically/genetically mapped on eight LGs/chromosomes and field phenotypic data (DF and DM) of 190 mapping individuals and parental accessions were correlated using composite interval mapping (CIM) function of MapQTL 6.28 The LOD threshold score of more than 4.0 at 1,000 permutations was considered significant (P < 0.05) to identify and map the major QTLs on LGs governing DF and DM traits in chickpea. At significant LOD, the positional genetic effect and phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by QTLs were measured. QTL Network v2.0 was used to determine the additive effect of marker loci underlying the QTLs. At 1.5-LOD support intervals (95% bootstrap CI), the confidence intervals (CI) around each significant major QTL peak was estimated.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genomic constitution of InDel markers in chickpea genomeThe comparison of resequencing data of three chickpea accessions ICC 4951 (cultivated desi), ICC 12968 (cultivated kabuli) and ICC 17160 (wild C. reticulatum) with reference genome of desi accession (ICC 4958) developed a total of 21,499 InDel markers (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2). These developed markers with diverse potential of detecting in silico InDel polymorphism in all possible-pair combination of four different chickpea accessions were physically mapped on the eight chromosomes and unanchored scaffolds of desi chickpea genome (Fig. 2A–D). A maximum of 16 839 (78.3%) markers showing in silico InDel-based fragment length polymorphism between ICC 4958 and ICC 17160, followed by 4699 (21.8%) markers between ICC 4958 and ICC 12968 and 3252 (15.1%) markers between ICC 4958 and ICC 4951, and minimum of 1173 (5.4%) markers between ICC 4951 and ICC 17160 were identified (Fig. 2A–C). Interestingly, markers designed from 694 (3.2%) InDels were found to be commonly polymorphic among all four chickpea accessions used. The observed InDel marker-based genetic polymorphism overall reflect the close phylogenetic relatedness of desi rather than kabuli with wild accessions and evolutionary divergence of cultivated accessions from a common wild progenitor C. reticulatum as well as existence of a domestication-led bottleneck in cultivated desi and kabuli chickpea.2,14,29,30 Remarkably, in silico fragment length polymorphism detected by markers based on their size (bp) of InDels varied from 2 to 54 bp with an average of 6 bp (Supplementary Table S3). More than 76.8% (16,510) InDel markers showed 2 to 6 bp in silico fragment length polymorphism, whereas remaining 23.2% (4,989) markers had 7 to 54 bp fragment length polymorphism (Supplementary Figure S1). This trend of proportionate distribution of two different kinds of fragment length polymorphisms (2 to 6 bp: 75.3 to 87.5% and 7 to 54 bp: 12.5 to 24.7%) showing InDel markers detected in each possible-pair combination of four chickpea accessions used, remained almost similar (Supplementary Figure S1). A relatively higher frequency of markers with smaller size InDels (2 to 6 bp) identified in chickpea could be due to the use of NGS-based short sequence reads (<200 bp) and/or user-specific computational genomics tools/algorithms for detection of InDels among chickpea accessions at a genome-wide scale.33Schematic illustrating the major steps followed for successful development, validation and genotyping of InDel markers derived from diverse intergenic and gene (coding and non-coding) sequence components of chickpea genome for their genomics-assisted breeding applications.

Highest and lowest number of InDel markers were mapped on chromosomes 3 (1,468 markers with a mean map density: 15.9 kb) and 7 (488 markers with a mean map density: 17.3 kb), respectively. Interestingly, almost a similar level of map density of InDel markers was observed in all eight chickpea chromosomes, while it ranged from 15.4 kb for chromosome 6 to 18.8 kb in chromosome 8 with an average of 16.3 kb (Supplementary Table S1). Notably, only 120 (23.1%) of 520 Mb draft scaffold sequence (covering ~70% of 740 Mb estimated genome size of desi chickpea) has been anchored onto eight chromosome pseudomolecules of chickpea genome so far.14 The probability of physical mapping of InDel markers derived from the unanchored scaffolds onto chromosomes can be enriched by a subsequent increase in anchoring proportion of these scaffolds across the eight chickpea chromosomes. The detailed structural annotation of 21,499 InDel markers exhibited the presence of 16,993 (79%) and 4,506 (21%) markers in the intergenic regions and 3,228 protein-coding genes, respectively (Fig. 2E). Notably, we observed the presence of InDel markers in the 3,228 genes representing 11.7% of the total genes (27,571) annotated from desi chickpea genome. This is almost comparable with the proportionate occurrence (9–10%) of InDels-carrying genes documented in many crop plants, including sorghum and Arabidopsis.23 The gene-derived InDel markers included a maximum of 3,420 (75.9%) markers from the intronic sequence components of 2,238 genes, followed by 544 (12.1%) markers from the CDS of 487 genes, 290 (6.4%) markers from the downstream regulatory regions (DRRs) of 278 genes and minimum of 252 (5.6%) markers from the upstream regulatory regions (URRs) of 225 genes (Fig. 2E). Among the coding sequence variants, 87% of InDel markers affected initiation and stop codons as well as frameshift mutations. Interestingly, in both the genes and intergenic regions of desi chickpea genome, we observed a significantly higher relative distribution of InDel markers revealing 2 to 6 bp (75.7 to 77.1%) than 7 to 54 bp (22.9 to 24.3%) in silico fragment length polymorphism among four chickpea accessions (Supplementary Figure S1). The functional annotation of 4,506 InDel markers-containing 3,228 genes revealed their maximum correspondence with genes encoding growth, development and metabolism-related proteins (34%), followed by transcription factors (14%) and signal transduction (10%) and disease resistance-related proteins (6%), and minimum to transposons/retrotransposons (1%). In contrast to previous reports (60–70%) in many crop plants,23,31 a lower abundance of transposons/retrotransposons-associated InDel markers was observed in chickpea genome.Collectively, the structurally and functionally annotated InDel markers derived from the diverse sequence components of the genome/genes are specifically responsible for frameshift mutations due to disruption of ORFs (open-reading frames) in the coding regions. These probably have large impact on transcriptional gene regulation (expression) leading to alteration of gene functions in chickpea. While comparing the average frequency between coding-InDel polymorphism and non-synonymous SNP substitutions detected among four chickpea accessions, we observed a higher frequency of non-synonymous mutations (506 SNPs/Mb) than that of InDels (252 InDels/Mb) causing frameshift mutations in the coding regions of chickpea genes.3.2. Amplification and polymorphic potential of InDel markersTo determine the amplification and polymorphic potential of designed InDel markers, 6,580, including 3,042 and 3,538 InDel markers revealing 10–54 and 2–9 bp in silico fragment length polymorphism among four chickpea accessions, were selected for experimental validation using the agarose gel- and PCR amplicons resequencing-based assays, respectively. The overall criteria used to select InDel markers from the total 21,499 designed markers for our experimental validation study is depicted in Supplementary Figure S2. All the 6,580 selected markers were validated primarily by gel- and sequencing-based assays using the genomic DNA of four chickpea accessions (ICC 4958, ICC 4951, ICC 12968 and ICC 17160), from which the InDel markers were originally detected. This included 694 markers showing in silico fragment length polymorphism commonly among all four chickpea accessions. Notably, 6,482 of 6,580 markers produced single reproducible PCR amplicons in 2.5% agarose gel with a mean amplification success rate of 98.5% (Fig. 3A). Of these, 6,254 (96.5%) amplified markers showing in silico polymorphism at least between two combination of four chickpea accessions were validated experimentally using both agarose gel- and PCR amplicons resequencing-based assays (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Figure S3). The validation and genotyping of InDel markers particularly by PCR amplicons resequencing-based assay confirmed the presence of expected InDels, which further corresponded well with their in silico fragment length polymorphism detected among four chickpea accessions (Supplementary Figure S3).

A maximum number of three polymorphic alleles was amplified among accessions. The detailed information regarding accessions are provided in the Supplementary Table S1.

The identities of two InDel markers with their detailed information are mentioned in the Supplementary Table S3.The 6,254 informative polymorphic InDel markers were further genotyped in a diverse set of 24 desi, kabuli and wild accessions to assess their potential for detecting polymorphism among these chickpea accessions (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Figure S3). These markers overall produced 15,623 alleles (with an average PIC of 0.71) among accessions. The number of alleles detected by these markers varied from 1 to 3 with an average of 2.5 alleles per marker. Six thousand forty-eight (96.7%, mean PIC: 0.65) of 6,254 markers showed polymorphism between cultivated and wild chickpea accessions. Five thousand one hundred ninty-two (83%, mean PIC: 0.60) of 6,254 markers were found to be polymorphic between desi and kabuli. Notably, 4,315 (69%) markers revealed polymorphism among 11 desi accessions (1 to 3 alleles with mean PIC: 0.57), whereas 3,746 (59.9%) markers exhibited polymorphism among 12 kabuli accessions (1 to 2 alleles with mean PIC: 0.51).The inter-specific (96.7%) and also intra-specific (60–83%) polymorphic potential detected by the InDel markers among desi, kabuli and wild chickpea accessions is much higher than that estimated especially with random genome-wide SSR and SNP markers (~35%) as well as in silico polymorphic SSR and SNP markers (50–60%).5,7,32,33 The informative InDel markers with high intra-specific polymorphic potential developed by us at a genome-wide scale could serve as a valuable resource for their immense use in genomics-assisted breeding applications of chickpea. The aforementioned marker validation outcomes specifically inferred that 3,042 validated InDel markers revealing 10–54 bp in silico fragment length polymorphism among desi, kabuli and wild accessions have efficiency to be resolved and genotyped even by a simpler cost-effective agarose gel-based assay using numerous chickpea accessions.3.3. Genetic diversity potential of InDel markersThe evaluation of genetic diversity level based on pair-wise similarity among 24 desi, kabuli and wild chickpea accessions using 6,254 genome/gene-derived polymorphic InDel markers revealed a wide range of distance coefficient from 0.15 to 0.89 with an average of 0.57. The genetic distance among 23 cultivated desi and kabuli accessions ranged from 0.20 to 0.81 with an average of 0.51. The level of genetic diversity (15 to 89%) measured among the accessions using the InDel markers is comparatively much higher than that estimated previously with the microsatellite and SNP markers.5,7,10,11,34 A higher efficiency of InDel markers in assaying genetic diversity implies their significance in establishing distinctness among cultivated (desi and kabuli) and wild accessions and thus could be deployed in genomics-assisted varietal improvement program in chickpea. The genetic relationship among 24 desi, kabuli and wild chickpea accessions was depicted by an unrooted phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Figure S4). The genome/gene-derived InDel markers clearly discriminated all these accessions from each other and clustered into two major desi and kabuli groups. One wild C. reticulatum accession ICC 17160 being divergent from cultivated accessions; however, showing close evolutionary relationships with desi chickpea was clustered within a desi group. This overall reflects the correspondence of clustering patterns observed among these accessions with the known cultivar-specific origination, pedigree relationships and parentage.5,7,10,11,343.4. Generation of a high-density InDel marker-based inter-specific chickpea genetic linkage mapFor constructing a high-resolution inter-specific genetic linkage map, 6,219 InDel markers revealing polymorphism between parental accession ICC 4958 and ICC 17160 were genotyped among 190 individuals of a F5 mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160). The co-dominant inheritance pattern of the InDel markers was evident from their efficiency to discriminate homozygous mapping individuals of either of the parental accessions from heterozygous individuals (Fig. 3B). This suggests the broader practical applicability of developed genome-wide InDel markers for multiple large-scale rapid genotyping applications, including their suitability in construction of high-density genetic linkage maps and molecular mapping of high-resolution QTLs. By performing linkage analysis using the 6,219 marker genotyping data, we mapped 6,197 InDel markers across eight LGs of an inter-specific chickpea genetic map (Table 1, Fig. 4A). Highest number of markers were mapped on CaLG04 (1,123 markers), followed by CaLG03 (1,011 markers) and lowest on CaLG07 (457 markers). The generated eight LGs-based genetic maps spanned a total map length of 1,311.9 cM, with a mean inter-marker distance of 0.212 cM (Table 1). CaLG03 and CaLG07 had longest and shortest map length spanning 199.4 and 135.3 cM, respectively. Most saturated genetic map was constructed in case of CaLG04 (mean inter-marker distance: 0.162 cM), followed by CaLG06 (0.175 cM) and least saturated map was generated for CaLG01 (0.253 cM) (Table 1). An InDel marker-based inter-specific genetic linkage map (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) generated in our study had greater map density (inter-marker distance: 0.212 cM) and thus highly saturated when compared with that reported so far in multiple intra- and inter-specific mapping population-derived genetic maps (0.50–8.01 cM) of chickpea.5,7,8–10,12,27,35Characteristics of an inter-specific genetic linkage map constructed using a 190 F5 chickpea mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160)Characteristics of an inter-specific genetic linkage map constructed using a 190 F5 chickpea mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160)(A) A high-resolution inter-specific genetic map (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) constructed by integrating 6,197 InDel markers on eight LGs of chickpea, are depicted in a Circos circular ideogram.

The detail information regarding InDel markers and QTLs are mentioned in Supplementary Table S3 and Table 2. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.5. Molecular mapping of QTLs governing flowering and maturity time in chickpeaA significant phenotypic difference of DF (25.7–111.0 with 81% H2) and DM (86.4–151.3 with 85% H2) traits in 190 mapping individuals (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) and two parental accessions across 2 years was observed based on ANOVA (Supplementary Table S4). ANOVA outcomes inferred existence of a highly significant difference (P < 0.001) of DF and DM traits among the mapping individuals although significant environmental (years) effects observed on these two traits in both seasons/years. A bi-directional transgressive segregation, including normal frequency distribution of DF and DM traits in mapping individuals and parental accessions across 2 years, was obtained (Supplementary Figure S5A and B). These results collectively indicate that the complex quantitative genetic inheritance pattern of DF and DM traits in our developed inter-specific mapping population (ICC 4958 × ICC 17160) are regulated by multiple genes and thus have significance to be utilized for QTL mapping.The 2 years multi-location field phenotyping data of DF and DM traits and genotyping information of 6,197 InDel markers genetically mapped on eight LGs were integrated for molecular mapping of QTLs. This analysis identified three major genomic regions harboring three of each significant (LOD: 8.1–11.5) DF (CaqDF1.1, CaqDF2.1 and CaqDF3.1) and DM (CaqDM1.1, CaqDM2.1 and CaqDM3.1) QTLs that were mapped across three LGs (CaLG01, CaLG02 and CaLG03) (Table 2, Fig. 4B). The individual major QTL explained 17.5–27.5% and 16.4–26.9% phenotypic variations (R2) for DF and DM traits, respectively. The PVE measured for all three of each robust DF and DM QTLs in combination was 68 and 65%, respectively. The identified six DF and DM QTLs being validated and exhibited consistent PVE (>10% R2) at higher LOD (8.1–11.5) across two seasons (years) were considered as robust QTLs. Three major genomic regions (1.036, 1.555 and 1.292 cM marker genetic intervals on CaLG01, CaLG02 and CaLG03, respectively) underlying these six robust DF and DM QTLs spanned with 45 InDel markers, were mapped on three different genomic regions with similar marker intervals across three LGs (Fig. 4B). The molecular mapping and clustering of multiple DF and DM QTLs especially on a single major genomic region of three LGs infers complex genetic inheritance pattern of these quantitative traits in chickpea. All these six DF and DM QTLs exhibited positive additive gene effects (3.9–6.4) for early flowering and maturity time with major allelic contributions from ICC 4958 (Table 2). This could be due to strong positive correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r: 91%, P < 0.0001) between DF and DM traits observed in an inter-specific mapping population (Supplementary Figure S5C). The five InDel markers tightly linked to six major DF and DM robust QTLs identified by both single marker- and CIM-based QTL analysis (Table 2) could have potential to be deployed in marker-assisted genetic enhancement for developing early flowering and maturing chickpea cultivars.

This indicates that DF and DM trait-associated QTLs identified by us are novel and possibly exhibit population-specific genomic distribution.3.6. Delineation of candidate gene-based InDel markers regulating flowering and maturity time in chickpeaThe integration of genetic linkage map information of InDel markers spanning six robust DF and DM QTLs with that of physical maps of desi chickpea genome demarcated these three major QTL intervals into 89.3 (chromosome 1)–157.2 (chromosome 2) kb physical genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 (Table 2, Fig. 4B). The structural and functional annotation of these target genomic physical intervals underlying DF and DM QTLs on three desi chromosomes identified multiple candidate protein-coding desi chickpea genes. Interestingly, five InDel markers-containing genes among these, at three target major QTL intervals exhibited tight linkage with six DF and DM-regulating QTLs based on our high-resolution QTL mapping (Table 2, Fig. 4B). One InDel marker (CID_C_477164) in the CDS of a TCP [Teosinte branched 1 (tb1) Cycloidea, Proliferating cell factor (PCF)] transcription factor (TF) gene localized at CaqDF1.1 and CaqDM1.1 QTL region was associated strongly (R2: 25.8–28.6% at 9.8–10.7 LOD) with DF and DM traits (Table 2, Fig. 4B). Another two InDel markers (CID_C_4642382 and CID_S_5036) in the intron and CDS of MADS [MCM (Minichromosome maintenance) AGAMOUS DEFICIENS SRF (human serum response factor)] and DOF (DNA-binding One zinc Finger)-TF genes, respectively, annotated at CaqDF2.1 and CaqDM2.1 QTL region revealed strong association (R2: 17.5–20.4% at 8.5–9.7 LOD) with DF and DM traits. Additionally, two InDel markers (CID_C_4431329 and CID_S_93427) in the DRR and introns of Phytochrome F-box and AGAMOUS genes, respectively annotated at CaqDF3.1 and CaqDM3.1 QTL interval had strong association (R2: 28.7–30.2% at 10.3–11.5 LOD) with DF and DM traits (Table 2, Fig. 4B). These InDel markers-carrying genes are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation of diverse known flowering time pathways in crop plants, including legumes.41–44 The MADS, TCP and DOF transcription factors, and Phytochrome F-box and AGAMOUS genes have significant role in regulating the ABC model of flower development by defining the genetic mechanism underlying the floral organ identity and floral architecture as well as through controlling signal perception during floral transitions from vegetative to reproductive phase specifically in Arabidopsis and other crop plants.45–48 In this context, the InDel markers-associated QTLs and five potential candidate genes regulating flowering and maturity time delineated in the present study, thus have functional relevance to understand the genetic basis of complex flowering and maturity time traits in chickpea.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.orgFundingThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by a research grant (102/IFD/SAN/2161/2013-14) from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India.

IntroductionEukaryotes typically display high proportions of repetitive elements that outmatch 50% of the genome. Among these repetitive elements, satellite DNAs (satDNAs) are a class of diverse tandemly repeated DNA sequences that build long arrays located in heterochromatin and often represent the most abundant genome fraction.1 They are usually highly prevalent at and around centromeres, which are regions with suppressed recombination.2 Centromeric satDNAs change rapidly during evolution despite their conserved function at the centromeric locus.3 In addition to extreme diversity in nucleotide sequences between species, centromeric satDNAs are typically characterized by sequential arrangement of monomers in the form of long arrays and by preferential monomer length corresponding to the size of nucleosomal DNA.4Our current knowledge about satDNA evolution is mostly based on studies of centromeric satDNAs. SatDNAs evolve in concert as a result of molecular drive, a process by which mutations are homogenized throughout a family of monomers in a genome, and are fixed in a population.5 Theoretical models predict unequal crossing-over and gene conversion as the most widespread mechanisms involved in dynamics of satDNAs evolution.2,6,7 Studies on human centromeric alpha satDNA show that these mechanisms act more efficiently within arrays than between arrays, and decrease progressively between arrays on homologous and on heterologous chromosomes.8 Internal tandem repeats (TRs) found in some transposable elements (TEs) boost them to propagate satellite sequences throughout the genome.9,10 In addition, recent results strongly support the idea that rolling circle amplification and reinsertion of extrachromosomal circles can be important for efficient dispersion of satellite arrays through a genome.11Genome-wide annotation and study of TR-rich regions from assemblies of complex genomes represent a challenge. Due to the long arrays composed of nearly identical monomers, these genome fractions remain the most poorly mapped in assembled genomes. Moreover, centromeric regions are commonly omitted from the assembly of a genome. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of large arrays of TRs (>10 kb) located in the euchromatic part of the human genome showed a wide range of monomer size variations, from several nucleotides to several kilobases.12 Among them, one of the largest non-centromeric arrays is 600 kb to 1.7 Mbp long, being located on human chromosome 8 and composed of 12 kb long monomers. Bioinformatics analysis of two mouse whole-genome shotgun assemblies revealed eight new satDNAs including some chromosome-specific satDNA subfamilies, which serve as a unique chromosome bar code.13 Concerning evolutionary dynamics, comparative analysis of the most abundant satDNA in D. melanogaster, known as 1.688 satDNA, shows differential rates of concerted evolution in distinct genomic regions, from euchromatin to centromeric heterochromatin.14 In addition to variations in chromosomal distribution, a novel alignment-free algorithm applied to Human Satellite 3 estimates extreme array size variation (7–98 Mb) of the HSat3 between individuals on the Y chromosome, thus confirming considerable satDNA array size polymorphisms.15 Recent reports on satDNA impact on euchromatic genome suggests roles in modulation of gene regulation,16,17 in disease-associated gene mutations18 as well as in accumulation of differences within genes between human and chimpanzee.19Tribolium castaneum is considered to be the most important model organism after Drosophila in studies of insect development, population genetics, and comparative genomics. Its genome is also the first coleopteran genome to be sequenced.20 The genomes of Tribolium beetles are characterized by massive blocks of one or two abundant species-specific satDNAs localized in centromeric regions.21–25 In T. castaneum, two related subfamilies of TCAST satDNA, estimated to comprise up to 35% of the whole genome, encompass the centromeric heterochromatin.26 Furthermore, the two types of TCAST-like elements are found dispersed within euchromatin. The first represents TCAST satellite-like elements in the form of short arrays (up to tetramers), whereas the second consists of TCAST-like elements embedded within a complex unit similar to DNA transposon.27Three complementary approaches, used for de novo genome-wide identification of repetitive DNA, recovered >30% of repetitive DNA in the assembled part of the T. castaneum genome.28 All T. castaneum chromosomes are characterized by large blocks of heterochromatin surrounding centromeres, while no prominent heterochromatic blocks could be detected cytogenetically on chromosome arms.29 Although centromeric satDNA is underrepresented in the assembled genome of T. castaneum analyses performed by Wang et al.28 revealed significant portion of TRs with monomer over 100 bp in length. These results indicate the existence of a number of satDNA candidate sequences distributed outside the centromeric regions, in euchromatic chromosomal arms. The availability of a genome assembly based on whole-genome shotgun (WGS) reads as well as on Fosmid and BAC end-sequences offers a good platform for genome-wide study of TRs. A similar study of evolutionary trends of 1.688 repetitive DNA has already been performed for the Drosophila genome14 where sequencing and assembly approaches were used in a way similar to that in T. castaneum.20In this work, combining bioinformatics and experimental approaches, we identified and studied content, distribution, and structural features of TRs in the T. castaneum genome. Given the general lack of knowledge about TRs in euchromatic regions, we further focused on the nine most abundant TR families detected in the assembled genome. FISH experiments confirmed their almost exclusive localization in euchromatic chromosomal arms, while phylogenetic analyses revealed their highly dynamic evolution, particularly evident in their extensive exchanges between non-homologous chromosomes. Our results also suggest that in addition to other mechanisms, transposition may play an important role in the efficient spread of the most expanded TR family.2. Materials and methods2.1 Satellite DNA database construction and phylogenetic analysesThe T. castaneum (Tcas3.0) genome was assembled using the gold-standard Sanger assembly strategy with the benefit of extensive genetic maps obtained by the Tribolium Genome Sequencing Consortium.20 More detailed, high-quality sequence reads were produced from WGS sequencing libraries of ~3 and 6 kb in pUC18 subclones, as well as additional reads from fosmids (40 kb) and BACs (130 kb). These reads were assembled using the Atlas suite of assembly tools.20 The assembled genome of T. castanem was downloaded in the fasta format from the web page ftp://ftp.bioinformatics.ksu.edu/pub/BeetleBase/3.0/ (The third version of the assembly: Tcas_3.0) in the form of 10 chromosomes. The sequence of each chromosome was uploaded to Tandem Repeats Database (TRDB),30https://tandem.bu.edu/cgibin/trdb/trdb.exe and analysed using Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) algorithm.31 All chromosomes have been processed with TRF using alignment parameters 2, 7, 7 for match, mismatch, and indels, respectively, and a minimum alignment score of 50. The range of the period size 100–500 bp was selected to exclude the micro/minisatellite fraction. The initial raw TRF output included TR arrays with overlapping genome coordinates. Using the redundancy elimination tool in TRDB and additional manual elimination, arrays with the shorter monomer units were selected for further analyses. Arrays with unspecified (N) nucleotides in both flanking regions were removed. Analysis of monomer length trends in extracted arrays was performed using the filtering option for copy number in arrays. For further analyses arrays with =5 monomers were selected. They were merged and analysed with the clustering tool integrated in TRDB. Conditions were as follows: P-value excluded (set to 0), cut-off value set at 70%, heuristical and DUST algorithm excluded, PAM algorithm included with default values (0.7 and 0.3). The result of these analyses was formation of clusters, i.e. groups of arrays that represent TR families. Monomer sequences of all arrays from selected clusters were downloaded in the fasta format. Left and right flanking regions (extending up to 4000 bp) of all selected clusters were also downloaded. Multiple sequence alignments of monomers were done using Clustal W for each TR family. Alignments without truncated monomers from the beginning and the end of the array were used for phylogenetic analyses. The Lasergene software package v.7.0.0 (DnaStar) was used in dot plot analyses and PCR primer design. Monomer sequence variability was analysed using DnaSP v.4.10.9.32 Maximum likelihood (ML) trees based on Clustal W alignment were obtained with the PhyML 3.0 software33 using best-fit models calculated by the jModelTest 2.1.3.34 Due to the large number of monomers, branch support was evaluated using the approximate likelihood ratio test.35 Trees were displayed with FigTree v1.40 and adjusted in Corel11 software. All new TR families were blasted against the NCBI GenBank Database and Repbase36 to check similarity with published sequences. Sequence editing, selection of restriction enzymes (REs) and MUSCLE alignments of flanking regions were performed using the Geneious 5.4.3 program.37 In order to extract TCAST variants from unassembled reads, TRF and clustering analyses were done on 2153 unassembled reads (ftp://ftp.bioinformatics.ksu.edu/pub/BeetleBase/3.0/) under the TRF parameters described above. The consensus sequences of five TCAST subfamilies were constructed based on multiple alignments of all extracted variants (available upon request). Recombinant clones with monomers or dimers of satellite DNA were sequenced by the Macrogen Europe Laboratory (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Monomers of 9 TR families were deposited in EMBL databank under Accession Numbers: Cast1 (KP846079-KP846566), Cast2 (KP846568-KP847079), Cast3 (KP847080-KP847309), Cast4 (KP847310-KP847735), Cast5 (KP847736-KP848112), Cast6 (KP848113-KP848269), Cast7 (KP848352-KP848270), Cast8 (KP848353-KP848472), Cast9 (KP848473-KP848536) and consensus sequence of new TCAST subfamilies (KR046220-KR046222).2.2 DNA isolation, cloning and sequencingA T. castaneum culture (laboratory strain) was obtained from the Central Science Laboratory (Sand Hutton, York, UK). Insects were maintained on flour and kept in glass jars at room temperature, in a laboratory at the Ruder Boškovic Institute. Genomic DNA was isolated from adults by standard phenol–chloroform extraction. Primers were constructed based on the consensus sequences of each TR families as well as on the R66-like flanking region. Primer sequences and their positions on monomer consensus sequences are indicated in Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S1. The reaction mixture consisted of a reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega), 0.4 mM of each primer and 20 ng of genomic DNA. The PCR cycling parameters used were as follows: 2 min initial denaturation at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. Final extension was at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). PCR products were ligated in a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega) and transformed in Escherichia coli DH5a-competent cells (Invitrogene). Recombinant clones with monomers or dimers of satellite DNA were sequenced by the Macrogen Europe Laboratory (Amsterdam, The Netherlands).2.3 Southern and dot blot analysesStandard procedures were used for restriction endonuclease digestions, electrophoresis and transfer to nylon membranes. For genomic Southern hybridization analysis, 8 µg of genomic DNA was digested with REs which cut once in most monomer sequences and REs with recognition sites only in some monomers; HinfI and HaeIII (Cast1), EcoRI and HaeIII (Cast2), HaeIII and HinfI (Cast4), RsaI and DraI (Cast 5) and HaeIII and HinfI (Cast7). Digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose, denatured and DNA transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham). Cloned satellite monomers labelled with biotin-16-dUTP by PCR were used as hybridization probes. Hybridizations were performed overnight under moderate stringency conditions (65°C) in buffer containing 250 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 20% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% blocking reagent and 50 ng/ml of the probe. Post-hybridization washes were done in 20 mM Na2HPO4/1 mM EDTA/1% SDS at a temperature 2°C lower than the hybridization temperature. Chemiluminescent detection was carried out using the alkaline phosphatase substrate CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science). The abundance of TR families was estimated by quantitative dot-blot analysis using a series of genomic DNA dilutions ranging from 50 to 200 ng. Satellite monomers, excised from a plasmid, were dot-blotted in the range between 0.05 and 1 ng, and used as a calibration curve.2.4 Chromosome preparations and two-colour fluorescence in situ hybridizationMale gonads were isolated from adults and chromosome spreads were prepared by the ‘squash’ technique as described previously.38 Detailed mapping of nine new TR families on chromosomes in meiotic pro metaphase was not possible due to extremely rare observation of this phase. The condensation state in this phase also causes lower FISH sensitivity especially in the case of low copy families. Technical difficulties were overcome by using chromosomes in mitotic pro metaphase which enabled detection of centromere regions together with FISH signals of newly detected TR families. Two-colour FISH was carried out to determine the positions of new TR families related to centromeric regions. A TCAST-specific probe was generated by nick translation labelling of cloned dimer sequences with Cy3-dUTP using the Nick Translation Mix (Roche Applied Science). FISH probes for TR families detected in this work (Cast1–Cast9) were obtained by PCR labelling of cloned monomers with biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Applied Science) by using M13 forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen). In order to investigate in situ localization of Cast5 arrays with respect to their flanking regions, two-colour FISH was used. Probes were generated by PCR labelling of cloned Cast5 with Cy3-dUTP and R66-like flanking sequences with biotin-16-dUTP. Hybridizations were performed for 18 h at 37°C in a solution containing 60% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulphate, 20 mM sodium phosphate, and 10 ng/µl of each probe. Post-hybridization washes were done in 50% formamide/2× SSC at 37°C. Biotin-labelled probes were detected with fluorescein avidin D and biotinylated antiavidin D (Vector Laboratories). The chromosomes were counter-stained with DAPI 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and analysed with appropriate filters on an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus DP70 digital camera system. Merging of images was performed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended Version 12.0 software.3. Results3.1 Distribution and monomer length of TRs in the assembled T. castaneum genomeIn order to identify features and distribution of TRs in the output of the assembled T. castaneum genome, we analysed all 10 assembled chromosomes individually using the TRF software. Two thousand nine hundred and sixty arrays of TRs comprising a total length of 3.25 Mb were obtained. These repeats constitute 2.1% of the 156 Mb long T. castaneum genome assembly. To determine whether TRs identified in our study might show any preferential genome localization with respect to the repeat copy number, distributions of short (<5 monomers) and long (=5 monomers) arrays were analysed separately and presented along 10 T. castaneum chromosomes (Fig. 1). The 300 kb long uncaptured gaps between scaffolds were taken into account to mark dominant gaps in the assembled genome. The abundance of short and long TR arrays is evidently higher in CH3, CH6, CH8, CH9 and CH10 than in other chromosomes. The obtained results are in accordance with the previous study of Wang et al.,28 where RepeatScout and TEpipe tools revealed higher accumulation of the repetitive class named HighA and of TEs in the same chromosomal subset. Here, short TR arrays (<5 monomers) showed almost uniform distribution along the assembled chromosomes (Fig. 1). Interestingly, long arrays (=5 monomers) displayed a higher tendency to reside in the euchromatic chromosomal compartment, being less represented in the putatively heterochromatic domains proposed by Wang et al.28 Although the observed trend of long array distribution could be affected by gaps in the assembly of tandemly repeated sequences, marked uncaptured gaps do not seem to be more frequent in putative heterochromatic domains than in euchromatic chromosomal segments. Declared heterochromatic domains in the assembled genome represent chromosomal regions with high proportion of HighA and TE repetitive classes. Taking into account that the HighA sequence library includes 30% of TEs obtained by the TEpipe algorithm, and only a small fraction (~6%) of TRs obtained by TRF,28 we conclude that HighA is mostly built of dispersed repetitive sequences, for example, non-autonomous TEs.

Vertical bars represent short arrays (<5 monomers/array, upper line) and long arrays (=5 monomers/array, lower line).

Red triangles indicate assumed position of the centromere and large blocks of centromeric heterochromatin based on our FISH analyses (Fig. 4), chromosome banding29 and HighA domain (putative heterochromatin) defined in Wang et al.28To explore trends of monomer length in extracted arrays and a possible correlation with copy number of monomers, all 2960 arrays were subdivided into three classes: arrays with =2 monomers (634 arrays), 3–4 monomers (1563 arrays) and =5 monomers (763 arrays). Each class was analysed separately (Fig. 2). Arrays with only two repeat units are predominantly built of monomers having a length between 100 and 180 bp, while the number of array drops with increased monomer size (Fig. 2A). Arrays with 3–4 monomers as well as arrays =5 are predominantly built of 160–180 bp long monomers, while the relative contribution of arrays with <160 bp long monomers drops significantly (Fig. 2B and C). In the same time, the profile of arrays is enriched with 200–220 and 320–340 bp long monomers (Fig. 2B and C). Furthermore, a dramatic decrease in the number of long arrays is evident when monomer length exceeds 340 bp (Fig. 2C). Correlation of monomer number in extracted TRF arrays and monomer length.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.2 Revision of centromeric TCAST satDNACentromeric TCAST satDNA was identified experimentally.21,26 Bioinformatic identification of repetitive DNA by RepeatScout revealed only 0.3% of TCAST satDNA in the assembled genome,28 while the majority of sequenced TCAST satDNA was retained in unassembled reads. We extracted TCAST monomers from unassembled reads to define all sequence variants (data not shown). The alignment of all monomers revealed five subfamilies of TCAST satDNA with mutual sequence similarity of 70% and monomer length variation from 332 to 384 bp (Fig. 3). Two subfamilies (subf1 and subf3) were previously described,21,26 while others are identified in this work for the first time. Dramatic monomer length variation is mainly due to insertion/deletion events in one region of extracted monomers. In order to explore the distribution of this satDNA in the assembled genome, we mapped TCAST satDNA on assembled chromosomes by BLAST search using consensus sequences of all subfamilies as queries (red spots in Fig. 1). We determined 130 short arrays of mainly 1–2 monomers, distributed randomly along chromosomes.

Consensus sequences of subfamilies are derived according to the majority principle in alignment of variants from unassembled reads. Monomer length variation in the central region is highlighted in grey.Due to small chromosome sizes (only 1–3 µm), previous FISH analysis of TCAST satDNA had very poor resolution.21 To evaluate the centromeric localization of all TCAST subfamilies as well as to reexamine the karyotype with respect to the centromeric region, we performed individual FISH analyses with monomers specific for each of five subfamilies. Given that all FISH analyses show identical localization of TCAST subfamilies, we present only one of them in Fig. 4a. Tribolium castaneum has a 2n = 20 complement of chromosomes and a meioformula 9+XYp.29 Detailed cytogenetic analyses confirmed localization of TCAST subfamilies to centromeric regions of all chromosomes without any significant signals outside of centromeric regions. It must be noted that short TCAST arrays dispersed along the assembled genome are evidently below the detection level by FISH. FISH analyses also enabled identification of Yp, two metacentric chromosomes CH2 and CH3, and the largest telocentric chromosome CH4 (Fig. 4a). The remaining chromosomes are mostly small telocentrics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of centromeric TCAST satDNA and TR families determined in this work by TRF analysis.

Only TR families with >0.5% of genomic DNA are presented.3.3 Characterization of the most abundant TR families detected in the assembled genomeIn order to explore the most abundant TR families in the assembled T. castaneum genome we further focused on arrays with =5 monomers obtained in the TRF analysis output. This cutoff level was also selected to prevent blurring the results of phylogenetic analyses on selected most abundant TR families, that would be caused by a large number of branches in phylogenetic trees derived from monomers in shorter arrays. This analysis recovered 763 arrays with =5 TRs, cumulatively making up 1.63 Mb that constitute 1.04% of the assembled genome. Extracted arrays were clustered using tools implemented in the TRDB.30 Sequence identity >70% was selected as the clustering requirement in order to keep the identity level similar to that detected within the majority of satDNA families.39 Using this parameter, 371 arrays were further classified into 56 clusters; 23 containing 3–42 arrays, while others were those with only two related arrays. In order to explore in detail the most prominent TR families, we selected nine largest clusters which were represented with at least two arrays on at least two chromosomes. These criteria were set to enable comparative studies of monomers from different arrays located on a single chromosome as well as comparisons of arrays among chromosomes.Nine selected clusters comprise about two-thirds of arrays with =5 monomers (Table 1, clustering results are available on the TRDB website upon request). Monomers belonging to each cluster were further exported and named with letters and numbers related to the chromosome number, genomic position and position in the particular array. Each cluster thus represents the most abundant TR families hereafter indicated as Cast1–Cast9. Monomers were aligned with ClustalW (Supplementary Fig. S1) and structural characteristics of the nine TR families are summarized in Table 1. In agreement with the estimated correlation between monomer size and array length, 5 of 9 families are based on ~170 while two have ~340 bp long monomers. The remaining two families have monomers of ~110 and 210 bp, respectively. The number of tandemly repeated monomers in the obtained arrays is up to 54. The nucleotide sequences of all families show high AT content (=60%) and 9–28% nucleotide diversity within the family. The abundance of newly detected TRs in the assembled genome ranges from 0.006% up to 0.075% (9–117 kb). We also observed that periodicity of AT tracts is a prominent feature of all analysed TRs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Structural features of euchromatic TR familiesStructural features of euchromatic TR familiesBLAST search of both GenBank and RepBase with the consensus monomer sequence of each TR family as a query did not reveal significant similarity with any other sequence. However, local BLAST search with new TR families on repetitive classes obtained previously by RepeatScout28 recovered their significant homology with Cast4 and Cast5 (Supplementary Fig. S3). In particular, high homology is shown between the Cast4 family and 7 repetitive elements previously identified by RepeatScout which mostly represent dispersed dimers of Cast4 family as well as parts of monomers associated with different flanking regions. Similarly, three RepeatScout-defined elements show homology with Cast5. They are composed of Cast5 monomer and flanking regions (for details, see below).In addition to bioinformatic predictions of abundance and genome distribution, the newly found TR families were also examined by FISH, Southern analyses and dot-blot experiments (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Individual TR family members were amplified with specific primers derived from consensus monomer sequences obtained in this work (Supplementary Fig. S4). Cloned and sequenced monomers or dimers were further used as a template for the probe in hybridization experiments. Taking into account that genome segments rich in TRs remain poorly assembled and underestimated in outputs of genome projects, dot-blot hybridization was performed for each in silico detected TR family. Cast1 and Cast5 are the most abundant, each comprising >1% of the genome (Table 1). Cast2, Cast4 and Cast6 are less represented, each making up 0.5% of the genome, while other TR families comprise ~0.2% of the genome. In total, according to the results of dot-blot assay, estimated abundance of all analysed TR families is >4% of the genome. The experimentally determined genome content of these TR families is ~10 times higher than the representativeness in the assembled genome. For further support of abundance, we also analysed the presence of these TR families in T. castaneum unassembled reads, and these estimations confirmed the highest relative proportion of Cast1, Cast2, Cast5 and Cast6 (data not shown). It is important to observe that among the experimentally estimated contribution of TR families that make >4% of the genome, the most abundant (>2.7%) are those based on ~170 bp monomer, while families with ~340 bp monomer comprise >1.2% of the genome.To validate the TR profile of the sequence sets generated in silico, Southern blot hybridization analyses were carried out on the most prominent TR families (Fig. 4). Genomic DNA was digested using REs which cut once in the majority of monomer sequences as well as with REs having a recognition site only in some monomers. In addition to a strong signal of predicted monomer size, typical satellite ladder pattern was observed in all hybridization analyses.In order to detect chromosomal localization of Cast1–Cast9 families relative to centromeric regions, two-colour FISH was done combining each detected TR family and the centromeric TCAST satDNA. FISH analyses on chromosomes in mitotic pro metaphase enabled detection of centromeric regions together with signals of newly detected TR families (Fig. 4). As already shown by dot-blot experiments, signals obtained after FISH with the most abundant Cast1 and Cast5 were significantly stronger relative to other Cast families. Interestingly, FISH results show localization of all nine TR families almost exclusively on non-centromeric/euchromatic chromosome parts. Only a few overlapping signals with TCAST could be observed in centromeric regions, particularly in the case of Cast5.3.4 Study of TR family evolution in euchromatic regionsIn order to assess evolutionary trends of dominant TR families located outside of centromeric regions in T. castaneum, we examined phylogenetic relationships between their monomers (Supplementary Fig. S1). Two thousand five hundred monomers originating from the nine selected families (Cast1–Cast9) were included in the analyses. Annotation with respect to their actual position allows detailed identification of phylogenetic relationships among monomers within and between arrays and chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S5). Simplified forms of ML trees with marked subgroups which show recent exchange events within a chromosome and between non-homologs are presented in Fig. 5. In all ML trees, the monomer groups show a significant level of exchange events which occurred between non-homologous chromosomes. Phylogenetic relationships of monomers of Cast1–Cast6 families presented in ML trees (A–F). Terminal branches are coloured according to the chromosome of origin. Monomers originating from a single array and grouped in a single branch of the tree are not specifically marked. Dominant groups which display putative recent exchange events are indicated with arches. Black arches mark monomers that group together in the tree, although they originate from arrays located on non-homologous chromosomes. Grey arches represent monomers in chromosome-specific arrays distant one from the other (>20 kb). Blank arches indicate monomers located in dominant chromosome-specific arrays positioned <20 kb apart. Symbols indicate monomers originating from the same array but dispersed in the tree. The branch support values are indicated at major branch points. (G) FISH of Cast6 family on T. castaneum chromosomes.

The branch support values are indicated at major branch points. (G) FISH of Cast6 family on T. castaneum chromosomes. Arrow points to the CH3 chromosome.The ML tree of Cast1 shows three groups of monomers originating from distant arrays (>20 kb) on homologous chromosomes and a recent exchange between non-homologous chromosomes (Fig. 5A). However, according to our FISH results, it can be concluded that the Cast1 family makes very long arrays which are not represented in the assembled genome.The Cast2 phylogenetic tree displays two distinct branches with monomers originating from arrays located on 6 or 7 non-homologous chromosomes (Fig. 5B). This dispersion pattern together with short branches grouped in subclusters indicates a relatively recent expansion of arrays between non-homologous chromosomes which occurred in two independent events. In addition, monomers of this family form one chromosome-specific cluster composed of monomers originating from three distantly located arrays (separated by at least 20 kb). In addition, the Cast2 tree reveals exchange events between the sex-chromosome (X, marked as CH1) and autosomes.The Cast3 family is characterized by low monomer divergence (11%; Table 1) and short arrays mainly comprised of 5–7 monomers (Fig. 5C). Cast3 monomers derived from the majority of short arrays show a scattered distribution in the ML tree (see symbols on the tree), while those from longer arrays (up to 19 monomers) group together.The Cast4 family is characterized by significant monomer divergence (21%; Table 1) observed even among monomers within arrays, as evident by long branches in the tree. Nevertheless, monomers from the same array tend to group together (Fig. 5D). Two modes of chromosome-specific clustering are distinctive: (i) arrays are located close to each other (<20 kb) and probably homogenized together, and (ii) arrays are distant (>20 kb) and show intra-chromosomal exchanges.Regardless the lowest overall monomer sequence divergence (9%), Cast5 shows clear grouping of monomers originating from the same arrays (Fig. 5E). In addition, monomers from the same chromosome show a tendency to group together even when arrays are positioned at distant locations. The tree also suggests recent inter-chromosomal exchange in a fraction of monomers. Cast7, Cast8 and Cast9 trees are not shown here because they follow similar evolutionary trends as for the TR families described above.Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis of Cast6 (Fig. 5F) revealed that its long arrays are predominantly located on the chromosome CH3. Monomers in arrays evidence significant intra-chromosomal exchange. An almost exclusive localization of the Cast6 family on CH3 was also confirmed by FISH with the Cast6 monomer as a probe on the meiotic pro metaphase plate (Fig. 5G). The coherence between sequence data for Cast6 from the assembled genome and FISH experiments further confirms the authenticity of the genome assembly.Although each family shows its own pattern in the phylogenetic tree, common features can be deduced. The presented tree topologies show predominant clustering of monomers derived from the same array. This is particularly true for monomers derived from long arrays while those from short arrays generally do not show any consistent grouping. A general observation deduced from all extracted TR families is that monomers in arrays positioned on the same chromosome do not group with a frequency significantly higher than monomers located on non-homologous chromosomes. In support of this, but with exception of Cast6, all of the TR families show grouping of monomers from arrays located on nearly all non-homologous chromosomes, thus suggesting extensive inter-chromosomal exchanges.3.5 Possible mechanisms of propagationIn order to investigate putative propagation mechanisms for the analysed TR families we first wanted to check if they are just passively carried by expansion of other DNA segments in the genome. If this is so, it would be expected that array flanking regions or at least some of them are mutually homologous. To address this question, we generated 4 kb long left and right array flanking regions from the TRF output and compared them separately for each family. Our results show that among the nine TR families, only Cast2 and Cast5 display homologies in their flanking regions. The Cast2 family show homology only in a small number of left flanking regions (7 of 36 arrays), while the vast majority of Cast5 arrays (22 of 28) could be grouped according to similarities in left and right flanking regions. Flanking regions of Cast5 are further similar to R66 and R140 repetitive sequences (Supplementary Fig. S3) extracted previously from the sequenced T. castaneum genome by RepeatScout analyses.28 Detailed analyses of R66 and R140 show that both sequences are composed of Cast5 monomer parts together with parts of the array flanking region. Alignments of R66 and R140 (without the monomer part) with the flanking sequences of Cast5 family are presented in Supplementary Fig. S6. In both cases, flanking regions show homology in 1 kb long segments, although R140-like flanking regions in some variants extend up to 2 kb. Significant variations were detected in positions of both left and right junctions of flanking sequences with respect to the TR array. A search of RepBase with R66-like and R140-like Cast5 flanking regions as a query shows stretch of 140 bp with a high homology (84%) of R140-like sequence to the non-autonomous Tc1/Mariner transposon defined in T. castaneum. This result suggests possibly a transposon property of Cast5 flanking regions (Supplementary Fig. S6). In support, two-colour FISH with Cast5 monomer and centromeric satDNA (Fig. 4F) indicates higher expansion of Cast5 family in comparison with all other families.A schematic presentation of flanking regions and arrays of Cast5 family members with respect to monomer composition and orientation is presented in Fig. 6A. The same orientation of monomers relative to flanking regions can be observed in almost all arrays, while flanking modules and monomers together are positioned in both directions with respect to the orientation of genomic sequences.

Two-colour FISH of R66-like (green) and Cast5 (red) probes hybridized on T. castaneum chromosomes (B).To investigate the extent of genomic co-localization of Cast5 repeats and flanking regions, we further performed two-colour FISH experiment with probes specific for the flanking sequence similar to R66 and for the Cast5 monomer (Fig. 6B). The results obtained on meiotic pro metaphase chromosome spreads produced mostly co-localized hybridization signals, although individual signals corresponding to the flanking region as well as to TR family alone can be seen. This result is in accordance with bioinformatic analysis of Cast5 arrays in which some flanking sequence diverges significantly from R66-like.Given that the other analysed TR families do not show any regularity in flanking regions, we inspected junction position in monomer sequences in order to asses if there is any preferential monomer part that might be linked with the transition site. Inspection of these junctions did not reveal any evident correlation between the sequence and junction position (data not shown).4. DiscussionA global survey of TRs throughout the entire genome is important for correct annotation of these sequences in genome assemblies, and also to improve insights into their evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of emergence and expansion. The availability of a whole-genome assembly of T. castaneum mapped to chromosomes was the most important prerequisite in addressing these issues, making possible examination of TR evolution at the chromosomal and at the repeat-array level. To reveal the distribution profile and structural features of TRs as well as to build a database of highly abundant TRs, we first applied TRF analysis to the T. castaneum genome assembly, and focused on arrays with repeats in the range of 100–500 bp. The total amount of detected TRs is 1.63 Mb, which constitutes ~1.04% of the assembled genome. Arrays are not uniformly distributed between chromosomes, showing higher density on five chromosomes. This result is in agreement with a previous report of overall repeat families and TE classes in the assembled genome.28 However, our combined FISH and bioinformatics studies of TCAST, the most abundant T. castaneum satDNA,26 confirmed the complete absence of centromeric regions in the genome assembly. The distribution profile of TCAST shows dominant localization in centromeric regions and arrays with only a few copies outside of centromeric regions. Another centromeric satDNA from T. castaneum, TCAST2, is similar to TCAST, and found in diverse euchromatic locations only in the monomeric form.40 Distribution profiles with large blocks of satDNA in centromeric regions and short arrays of centromeric satDNA (up to five monomers) located in the euchromatin were also defined for 1.688 and Rsp satDNAs in the Drosophila melanogaster genome.14,41In contrast to the centromeric region with dominant satDNA sequences, domains rich in dispearsed repeats and proclaimed as putative heterochromatin regions in Wang et al.28 flank large blocks of centromeric heterochromatin in T. castaneum. A similar architecture with alpha satDNAs predominantly located in centromeric regions and non-LTR transposons which colonize pericentromeric regions is observed in the human genome.42,43Regardless of insignificant presence of TCAST and TCAST2 outside of centromeric regions, the distribution profile of the entire TR content indicates their significant contribution in the assembled genome. Interestingly, in addition to the arrays composed of several repeats (<5 copies), there is a significant number of arrays based on =5 repeats.Moreover, FISH and quantitative analysis of the new, most abundant TR families (Cast1–Cast9) characterized in the assembled genome established them as euchromatic and recovered their existence in significantly higher amounts than predicted by the assembled genome data. This was particularly obvious in Cast1 FISH analysis, where strong signals suggest the presence of long unassembled arrays almost exclusively located outside of centromeric regions. The estimated genome size of 204 Mb is 44 Mb larger than the assembled genome sequence. Based on our results, it can be assumed that the dominant fraction of unassembled genome constitute highly abundant TRs, including centromeric satDNAs TCAST and euchromatic TR families Cast1–Cast9.Structural analysis of overall TRs in the assembled T. castaneum genome revealed a correlation between the monomer length and the number of monomers in arrays. There is an obvious predominance of ~170 bp monomer length if the number of monomers in an array increases. In agreement with the experimentally estimated contribution, the most abundant TR families detected in euchromatic regions have the monomer lengths of ~170 bp and of its double length. Similarly, all five subfamilies of centromeric TCAST satDNA are based on monomers of ~360 bp. The preferential length of repeat units in abundant TR families (both euchromatic and centromeric) can be linked to requirements for efficient DNA packing of long arrays in chromatin structures. It is well known that chromatin in eukaryotic genomes is organized into the nucleosome with 1.67 turns of DNA around the histone octamer (147 bp) plus the linker DNA with a variable distance (10–70 bp).44 Similar rules govern the human and plant centromeres where the periodicity of centromeric nucleosomes (CenH3) is found to be in accord with the satDNA monomer length,45–47 being predominantly of ~170 bp and of its double length.4 The phenomenon observed in this work can be thus explained by the length of DNA wrapped around 1 or 2 nucleosomes as a requirement that may facilitate regular phasing of nucleosomes, and it can be a necessary prerequisite for dramatic amplification of TRs in both, centromeric and euchromatic regions. It has also been proposed for centromeric satDNAs that the monomer length longer than two nucleosomes is rare because longer sequences are unlikely to stabilize nucleosomes.3,46 Our overall analysis of TRs in the T. castaneum assembled genome is in accordance with this idea, showing that the proportion of arrays built of monomers >380 bp dramatically decreases.In addition to preferential monomer length in the nine TR families structural analyses further revealed a periodic distribution of A or T tracts (4–10 nucleotides), in the same manner as observed in TCAST and other centromeric satDNAs found in several other Tribolium species.22 The periodic appearance of AA/TT dimers along eukaryotic DNA sequences, including those in centromeric regions, promote this nucleotide sequence pattern as a feature that may facilitate nucleosome formation.45,46 In this regard, periodically distributed tracts of As and/or Ts, present in many centromeric satDNAs of tenebrionid beetles were shown to define the sequence-induced curvature of the DNA helix axis and could facilitate the tight packing of DNA in centromeric heterochromatin.48,49 We hypothesize that, similar to the centromeric regions, monomer length and other sequence features (e.g. AT tracts) could be equally important for expansion of TRs in euchromatic regions and may be linked to the formation of hypothetical micro-heterochromatic regions embedded within the euchromatic chromosomal arms. Regardless of their similar structural features, our analyses show a high level of chromosomal compartmentalization of TRs in the T. castaneum genome, where prominent arrays of Cast1–Cast9 families are located almost exclusively in non-centromeric, i.e. euchromatic domains, in contrast to centromeric distribution of TCAST satDNA. Clear chromosomal compartmentalization of centromeric and different euchromatic TRs might suggest the existence of some additional requirements which could be important for expansion of TRs in different domains, for example, in functional centromeres.50Within this study, we also focused on the nine most prominent non-centromeric TR families (Cast1–Cast9) in order to define evolutionary trends and mechanisms of TR dispersion throughout the genome. Phylogenetic analyses of monomers show a similar evolutionary scheme for all analysed TR families. Clustering of repeats from the same array is mainly observed in longer arrays, while monomers originating from arrays built of 5–7 monomers are often found dispersed in phylogenetic trees. These data suggest that the efficiency of homogenization mechanisms and concerted evolution in euchromatic regions depends on array length. In support of this, early computer simulations showed that homogenization mechanisms work better in long arrays, but poorly in those containing only few repeats.7 In addition, our results show that monomers originating from the same chromosome do not group with significantly higher frequency than monomers located on heterologous chromosomes. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses recovered extensive exchanges between non-homologous chromosomes in almost all analysed TR families. This trend is particularly obvious in Cast2, Cast3, Cast4 and Cast5 families, where dominant clusters include arrays originating from all chromosomes. The presence of several subclusters originating from non-homologous chromosomes in almost each analysed tree allows us to propose that these families were spread in several rounds of inter-chromosomal exchange and subsequent amplification. Genome-wide expansion events suggest efficient mechanism(s) of TR propagation in euchromatic genome regions. Previous studies on evolutionary trends involving TRs were focused on centromeric satDNAs. Studies in plants and human thus showed higher sequence divergence between satDNAs located on different chromosomes than within a chromosome, and revealed the preferential occurrence of sequence exchange and homogenization at the intra-chromosomal level.51,52 The most prominent example is human alpha satDNA whose higher order repeat units show chromosome-specific differences in monomer composition and length.8 However, this homogenization pattern is not universal, and TRs in subtelomeric regions share a high degree of sequence identity despite being located on non-homologous chromosomes.53,54 It has been postulated that exchanges between non-homologous chromosome ends occur during meiotic prophase, when all chromatids are interconnected.53 Similarly, enhanced efficiency in the spread of centromeric satDNA between non-homologous chromosomes noticed in many Tribolium species could be facilitated by a bouquet formation which occurs during the first meiotic division.25,55To assess mechanisms underlying the spread of TR sequences throughout the T. castaneum genome, we analysed TR array flanking regions, and recovered homologous flanking regions which resemble TEs only for the extremely dispersed Cast5 family. This suggests that repetitive sequences of the Cast5 family were initially distributed by a certain transposition activity and additionally amplified in longer arrays. SatDNA transposition has been advocated in some studies as alternative mechanism in the evolutionary dynamics of human centromeric region56 Similarly, enrichment in TRs derived from LTRs in Zea mays centromeres raises the possibility that centromeric satDNA can be renewed or replaced by novel satDNA repeats derived from retrotransposons.57 In T. castaneum, TCAST-like elements have been identified within complex units that resemble a DNA transposon and some of them were inserted into introns.27It has also been proposed that the mechanisms of dispersion of TR families in human may be related to duplication of large segments in which arrays are embedded.12 Flanking regions of other analysed non-centromeric TR families in T. castaneum do not display mutual homology thus eliminating mechanisms of segmental duplication in the spread of these sequences. In addition, their junctions and flanking regions do not show any specific feature in the form of inverted repeats or motifs which could act as mediators in the mechanism of dispersion. However, taking into account that the T. castaneum genome is as AT-rich (67% A+T) as analysed TR families (66–74% A + T), we suspect that rolling circle amplification could be the mechanism of dispersion, while regions of micro-homologies in the form of AT tracts could be promoters of insertions at different locations. Recent data suggest rolling circle replication and reinsertion of extrachromosomal circular DNA as the mechanism of TR propagation in various organisms, including humans.11,58It has been proposed that recombination in centromeric regions is suppressed to prevent the deleterious effects of crossing over between megabase-sized arrays.59 However, the extremely efficient distribution and rapid expansion of different TR families found in euchromatic regions can induce intensive rearrangements between diverse genome loci and thus contribute to genomic instability. In addition, TRs dispersed throughout the genome have exceptional potential to evolve independently, creating lineage-specific changes in the structure, sequence, or chromosomal localization, and thus generating incompatibilities between populations/species. Such rapid changes in genomes have been implicated in the post-zygotic isolation of several Drosophila species demonstrating the critical role of satDNA in hybrid incompatibility.60,61 Recent data based on analysis of TR profiles in multiple populations of D. melanogaster show significant differentiation of many analysed simple TRs at the population level.62Recent studies indicated that TRs can have remarkable effects on the euchromatic part of the genome. For example, length variation in multimegabase stretches of satDNA repeats of the Drosophila Y chromosome could be the major source of epigenetic variation which can modulate gene expression and cause variable phenotypes including differences in immune response.63 Our analysis of non-centromeric TRs in T. castaneum shows extremely efficient propagation in the euchromatic regions and suggest that they could be important factors in the modulation of gene expression. Their impact could be the result of direct insertion of arrays in introns/regulatory elements of genes, or through the formation of micro-heterochromatic environment in the vicinity of genes which may lead to the position effect variegation, and thus modulating the gene expression.In conclusion, using a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches, we have delineated structural and evolutionary trends of TRs in euchromatic regions. The euchromatic chromosomal regions of the T. castaneum genome are replete with different highly abundant TRs which are prone to amplify into long arrays if they meet the preferential monomer length. In contrast to similar structural features between centromeric and euchromatic TRs, these two categories show clear chromosomal compartmentalization, suggesting that additional requirements may be imposed on sequences belonging to different regions. The observed evolutionary pattern of euchromatic TR families suggests intensive impact of concerted evolution on longer arrays, while homogenization of short arrays remains limited. Evolutionary trends suggest that efficient inter-chromosomal exchanges were followed by amplification on almost all chromosomes. Our results suggest efficient dispersion of nine TR families through the euchromatin regions and possible role of a transposition-like mechanism only in the case of the most expanded family. We propose that recombination between homologous TRs dispersed among euchromatic sequences can affect both expression of coding information as well as lead to deleterious chromosomal rearrangements.Authors’ contributionsN.M. conceived the study, designed the experiments and analyses, and wrote the manuscript.

IntroductionOxygen-evolving photosynthetic bacteria, known as cyanobacteria, are widely distributed throughout freshwater, seawater, brackish water, and soil surfaces, and can even be found in extreme environments, such as hot springs or polar regions.1,2 In addition to their ecological significance as a primary producer, cyanobacteria are well known among all photosynthetic eukaryotes as organisms that participated in the origin of plastids.3 Therefore, comparative genomics between cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes has attracted significant attention.4,5 Genomic data are rapidly accumulating as high-throughput genome sequencers have become more prevalent in the past decade; to date, over 100 cyanobacterial genome sequences have been deposited in public databases. By comparing these genome sequences, we can discover meaningful genetic features of a given genus or species of interest.6,7Cyanobacteria that grow on soil surfaces are morphologically and phylogenetically divergent.8 The genus Leptolyngbya, which are thin filamentous cyanobacteria characterized by the narrow width of their cylindrical trichomes (0.5–3 µm), have been isolated from various environments, including soil surfaces. The genus Leptolyngbya was proposed based on morphological observations,9 so Leptolyngbya is a form genus, and the molecular phylogenetic heterogeneity of Leptolyngbya has been occasionally debated.2,10,11 Herein, the genome of an axenic cyanobacterial strain Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104, which is a terrestrial strain isolated from crusts of another terrestrial cyanobacterium, Nostoc commune HK-02 (NIES-2114),12 was analysed. Leptolyngbya boryana, a species that is phylogenetically related to Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 (see Fig. 1), has been studied in detail to characterize its physiological properties, e.g. anaerobic nitrogen fixation13 and chlorophyll biosynthesis,14–20 and the near-complete genome sequence of a strain PCC 6306 was recently published.4 Despite the morphological similarities between Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306, the habitats in which each was found were significantly different—PCC 6306 was collected from freshwater and NIES-2104 was collected from a terrestrial sample. Many environmental factors, such as oxygen level, available water supply, and the intensity and spectrum of light, can vary between water bodies and soil surfaces. To obtain insights about the evolutionary history and adaptation to particular niches by these two Leptolyngbya strains, we obtained the complete genome sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and compared it with that of L. boryana PCC 6306. We focused specifically on genes that are likely associated with their niche differentiation, that are genes operating under micro-oxic conditions (genes for anaerobic nitrogen fixation and micro-oxic condition-inducible tetrapyrrole biosynthetic genes); genes that are associated with desiccation tolerance (genes for trehalose biosynthesis); and genes for ultraviolet (UV) absorbing sunscreen synthesis (genes for mycosporine-like amino acids and scytonemin biosynthesis). Our comparative genome analysis of these two Leptolyngbya strains provides insights into the adaptation strategies that these strains use to thrive under terrestrial and freshwater conditions.

NIES-2104, a strain isolated from crusts of another terrestrial cyanobacterium, N. commune HK-02 (NIES-2114)12 at Himeji, Hyogo, Japan, 2002, was subsequently acquired by the Microbial Culture Collection (MCC) of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan (http://mcc.nies.go.jp). Purity of the culture was assayed as previously described.21 Genomic DNA of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 was extracted by bead beating and then was purified using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, the Netherlands). A paired-end library was prepared using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) after fragmentation with a Covaris M220 (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). A mate-pair library of 8 kb inserts was prepared using the ‘gel-plus’ protocol of the Nextera Mate-Pair Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Both libraries were sequenced with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 600 cycles (Illumina) on a MiSeq instrument. We obtained 2,447,760 pair-end reads and 812,724 mate-pair reads as the output of MiSeq. Then, reads were de novo assembled using Newbler v2.9 (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany), which yielded 61 contigs and 8 scaffolds. Sequences of gaps between contigs and scaffolds were determined in silico using two programs—GenoFinisher and Ace File Viewer (both distributed by Dr Y. Ohtsubo of Tohoku University, Japan).22 Finally, gap-less sequences of five contigs (most likely one chromosome and four plasmids) were obtained. The complete genome sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 was deposited in the DDBJ database (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) with the accession numbers BBWW01000001–BBWW01000005.2.2. Phylogenetic analysisFor molecular phylogenetic analyses, 16S rDNA sequences (except for that of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104) were retrieved from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 with 16S rDNA sequences for 98 strains assigned as Leptolyngbya and 16S rDNA sequences of 4 strains and three uncultured cyanobacterium clones that showed high similarity to the 16S rDNA sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 or other Leptolyngbya strains. The 16S rDNA sequences of Gloeobacter violaceus sp. PCC 7421 and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168 were used as outgroups. The GenBank accession numbers for each OTU are listed in Fig. 1. Multiple sequence alignment was conducted using the MUSCLE algorithm implemented in MEGA5.2.2.23,24 A phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithms based on the K2+G+I model with 1000 bootstrap replications using the MEGA 5.2.2 package.23,242.3. Genome annotation of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and comparison with the genomes of Leptolyngbya boryana PCC 6306 and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120The genome sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and the draft genome sequence of L. boryana PCC 6306 retrieved from GenBank (accession numbers: KB731324, KB731325, KB731326, KB731327, and KB731328) were submitted to RAST25 using similar settings. Bidirectional blast best-hit pairs (query coverage =90%, percentage of identical matches =50) of the deduced proteins were considered orthologous. Deduced protein sequences of Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 were also retrieved from GenBank (accession numbers: NC_003272, NC_003276, NC_003240, NC_003267, NC_003273, NC_003270, and NC_003241) and were compared with those of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306.2.4. Synteny analysisWhole genome synteny between Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC6306 was analysed using MURASAKI26 (with a 25-bp seed that allows for a mismatch at 7 specific points: 1111110011110011111000111) and was visualized using nmny (http://mux.eee.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/nmny/trial).Syntenies of the nif gene cluster (nitrogen fixation-related genes), the micro-oxic condition-inducible tetrapyrrole biosynthetic gene cluster, the tre gene cluster (genes for trehalose metabolism), the mycosporine-like amino acid synthesis gene cluster, and the flanking regions between cyanobacterial strains were analysed and visualized using a program for comparing genome sequences, GenomeMatcher.22 GenBank accession numbers of the sequences and the loci analysed are described in Figs 3–6 and in the corresponding figure legends.3. Results and discussion3.1. Phylogenetic positioning of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 within the phylum cyanobacteria and comparisons with other Leptolyngbya strainsThere are notable examples that morphologically similar cyanobacteria occupy widely divergent positions within the molecular phylogenetic tree of cyanobacteria, although they are currently assigned to the same genus.10 This situation is controversial and problematic for cyanobacterial taxonomy. The form genus Leptolyngbya9 is also polyphyletic in the 16S rDNA sequence-based phylogenetic tree.10 Accordingly, the phylogenetic position must be investigated for each individual strain. To investigate the phylogenetic position of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences (Fig. 1).From our analysis, some Leptolyngbya strains formed a clade with high bootstrap support (Clade A–G, Fig. 1). Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 clustered with Leptolyngbya sensu stricto (clade A-2, Fig. 1) in a clade that includes type species L. boryana (e.g. L. boryana PCC 6306, which is a reference strain for Cluster 1 of the form genus Leptolyngbya,10 and Cluster 1 corresponds to Clade A-2 in Fig. 1). Similarities among 16S rDNA sequences, which are included in Clade A (Fig. 1), are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Among Clade A, the 16S rDNA sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 was most similar (96.7%) to that of Leptolyngbya sp. SEV4-3-C1 (AY239596). All SEV strains shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1 had been isolated from desert soils,2 and Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 had also been isolated from a terrestrial environment and is desiccation tolerant. Therefore, Clade A-2 (Fig. 1) is thought to be a terrestrial Leptolyngbya clade. Clade A also contains the recently proposed genus Plectolyngbya;27 however, the phylogenetic relationship of this genus with Clades A-1 and A-2 was unclear in our analysis.In Clade A (Fig. 1), the genome of L. boryana PCC 6306 had previously been sequenced.4 The identity of the 16S rDNA sequences between Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306 is ~95.3% (Supplementary Table S1); this value is slightly above the threshold of distinction for certain cyanobacterial genera (95%).28,29 Generally, bacterial strains that have a 16S rDNA sequence identity <97.5% are not likely to show DNA–DNA hybridization values >70% and are referred to as distinct species.30Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 does not show 16S rDNA sequence identity >97.5% with any of the sequenced organisms. Hence, Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 is most clearly related to the genus Leptolyngbya sensu stricto (Clade A-2, Fig. 1) and is probably a novel species.3.2. General properties of the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome and a comparison with those of Leptolyngbya boryana PCC 6306Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 is a non-nitrogen-fixing terrestrial strain, whereas L. boryana PCC 6306 is nitrogen-fixing freshwater strain. Herein, we compared the genome sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 with that of L. boryana PCC 6306 and inferred the genetic factors that contribute to habitat differentiation.While the genome sequence of L. boryana PCC 6306 is nearly completed (5 scaffolds comprise 19 contigs), we successfully obtained a complete genome sequence of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 (DDBJ accession numbers: BBWW01000001–BBWW01000005). General information about the genome is presented in Table 1. The genome of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 is composed of five circular DNA molecules (most likely one circular chromosome and four plasmids). The size of the largest circular DNA is 5,695,116 bp, and it contains 5,961 CDSs and all predicted RNA genes. The sizes of the other four DNAs are 318,180, 263,280, 84,246, and 25,488 bp, and these contain 329, 315, 81, and 26 CDSs, respectively. The total size of the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome is 6,386,310 bp, which is smaller than that of the 7,261,054 bp of L. boryana PCC 6306 genome. The GC content of the genome is 47.4%, which is comparable to the 47.0% of L. boryana PCC6306. There are three rDNA operons in the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome, which is similar to the L. boryana PCC 6306 genome. Some cyanobacteria have rDNA operon variants in their genome, such as Nostoc sp. PCC7120.31 Some strains of L. boryana (UTEX B 487, UTEX B 485, UTEX B 482, and UTEX B 488) have rDNA operon variants (the major difference between the variants is the presence or absence of both genes for tRNAIle and tRNAAla at the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region) in the genome, and the SEV strains do not have those variants.32 As predicted from our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1), Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 appears to lack the variant in the rDNA operon in its genome, as do the SEV strains. However, in contrast to our expectations, we could not identify the variant in the rDNA operons in the genome of L. boryana PCC 6306 (GenBank accession number: KB731324–KB731328), although strain PCC 6306 is virtually identical to strain UTEX B 482.4 This unexpected finding is presumably a consequence of the short-read sequencing and alignment used to assemble the genome of strain PCC 6306. General information about the genomes of two Leptolyngbya strainsNote: The genome of Leptolyngyba sp. NIES-2104 does not contain any gaps, whereas the genome of L. boryana PCC 6306 contains 14 gaps.General information about the genomes of two Leptolyngbya strainsNote: The genome of Leptolyngyba sp. NIES-2104 does not contain any gaps, whereas the genome of L. boryana PCC 6306 contains 14 gaps.The RAST annotation pipeline25 predicted 6,712 and 7,355 coding sequences for the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306 genomes, respectively, although these numbers of coding sequences are overestimates, because the originally published L. boryana PCC 6306 genome contains only 5,944 protein coding sequences (NCBI reference sequence accession number: NZ_ALVM00000000). Among those coding sequences predicted by RAST, we estimate that 3,378 protein pairs are orthologous based on a BLAST bi-directional best-hit strategy, so approximately half of the predicted protein sequences of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2014 have a high similarity value to L. boryana PCC 6306 orthologs. These orthologous proteins might define the physiological similarity of Clade A (Fig. 1), whereas the others could serve as the basis for the physiological differences. When similar approaches for predicting orthologous protein pairs were used against the filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 genome sequence, the numbers of ‘hits’ returned were 1,860 (Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 vs. Nostoc sp. PCC 7120) and 1,954 (L. boryana PCC 6306 vs. Nostoc sp. PCC 7120) orthologous protein pairs. These numbers represent a reference for the number of proteins that are conserved among cyanobacteria, even between species that are not closely related.Genome-wide synteny between Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306 was analysed using MURASAKI, and the results were visualized using nmny (Fig. 2). Small-scale synteny was somewhat conserved (see also Figs 3B, 4–6), but large-scale synteny was not observed between these two genomes (Fig. 2). Genomic synteny between Leptolyngbya sp.

Nitrogen fixation-related genes in Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and Leptolyngbya boryana PCC 6306Some filamentous cyanobacteria develop specialized cells, termed heterocysts, for nitrogen fixation within the trichome under nitrogen starvation conditions, and heterocyst provide micro-oxic conditions for oxygen-labile nitrogen-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase. Alternatively, nitrogen fixation by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria has been reported in many genera,33 e.g. Leptolyngbya (formerly known as Plectonema), Gloeothece, and Chroococcidiopsis. Within the authentic Leptolyngbya clade (Clade A, Fig. 1), many strains, such as L. boryana IAM M-101, L. boryana PCC 6306, and Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 73110, fix nitrogen under anaerobic conditions1,34 (note that L. boryana strain dg5 is a dark-adapted strain derived from strain IAM M-10118,34). The genome sequence of L. boryana sp. PCC 6306 contains a large gene cluster for nitrogen fixation, which is originally identified in the strain dg5.34 A BLAST search of the nitrogen fixation-related proteins from the L. boryana PCC 6306 genome against Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 did not return any significant similarities. We also searched for pseudogenes of nitrogen fixation-related genes in Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 using the DNA sequences of nitrogen fixation-related genes of L. boryana PCC 6306 as a query, but could not detect any similar sequences.When analysing synteny of the nif gene cluster of L. boryana PCC 6306 compared with other cyanobacteria, ~28 kb of the nif gene cluster of L. boryana PCC 6306 was highly similar to those of non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, such as Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 and Cyanothece sp. PCC 7425. We note that the cluster of the Cyanothece could be split into two genomic loci and the cluster of the Chroococcidiopsis contained an inversion within the locus (Fig. 3A). A ~63-kb genomic region of L. boryana PCC 6306, which contains a 28-kbp nif gene cluster, was missing in the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome (Fig. 3B). Homologous genes found in the flanking regions were dispersed in the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome, probably as a consequence of numerous genome rearrangements (Fig. 3B). This case is very similar to the differences that were observed within another cyanobacterial genus, Acaryochloris.35 Horizontal gene transfer of the nif gene cluster from another bacterial phylum to a cyanobacterial lineage has been reported;36 however, nif genes in the L. boryana PCC 6306 genome have high similarity to those of other cyanobacteria (Fig. 3A). This finding indicates that the nif gene cluster of L. boryana was inherited from its ancestor or was laterally transferred from another cyanobacterial lineage, and at least the nif gene clusters of L. boryana and C. thermalis PCC 7203 appear to share a common origin. In this study, we could not elucidate whether Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 had lost its nitrogen fixation gene cluster or whether L. boryana PCC 6306 had acquired its nitrogen fixation gene cluster after the bifurcation of its ancestors. Further studies to investigate the distribution of the nitrogen fixation gene cluster within the authentic Leptolyngbya clade (Clade A, Fig. 1), and the genomic features of strains that map near the base of the clade will be needed to answer this question. Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 was isolated from a colony of N. commune that inhabited the soil surface. Nostoc commune is a heterocystous cyanobacterium that can fix nitrogen, even under aerobic conditions. Terrestrial non-nitrogen-fixing Leptolyngbya can inhabit areas where available forms of nitrogen are replete, and multiple sources of nitrogen might be supplied by cohabiting nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, such as heterocystous cyanobacteria.Nitrogenase is an oxygen-labile protein, and recently the expression of the gene encoding nitrogenase in L. boryana was found to be regulated by the CnfR (cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation regulator) protein.34 CnfR is expressed under nitrogen-starvation conditions and can be activated under micro-oxic conditions.34 Gas diffusion is very limited in water compared with soil surfaces. Oxygen levels can be depressed by the respiration of microorganisms, and micro-oxic conditions frequently occur at the bottom of bodies of water. By contrast, micro-oxic conditions, which are needed for the expression and activity of nitrogenase, might rarely occur on the soil surface where there is a higher rate of gas diffusion, and nitrogen fixation by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria might be much more difficult on the soil surface than in water bodies. The difference in gas diffusion rates between these habitats could contribute the presence or absence of genes for nitrogen fixation in the species that we analysed.Regarding biological nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase also produces molecular hydrogen (H2) as a side product of ammonia.37 Most nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have ‘uptake hydrogenase’ for the oxidation of molecular hydrogen and the reproduction of a reductant.37,38 However, L. boryana PCC 6306 does not encode any homologous gene for uptake hydrogenase and neither does Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104. The genome sequences of these two organisms do not encode homologous genes for any known hydrogenase enzyme (neither uptake hydrogenase nor bi-directional hydrogenase). The lack of a hydrogenase enzyme might be one of the common genomic features of these two Leptolyngbya lineages (Clades A-1 and A-2, Fig. 1).3.4. Micro-oxic condition-inducible tetrapyrrole biosynthetic genesThe oxygen levels in environments where cyanobacteria live can be highly variable, and in some closed environments, cyanobacteria are often exposed to micro-oxic conditions because of the respiration of other bacteria and self-respiration.39 In such situations, cyanobacteria use some analogous enzymes for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, which mainly operate under micro-oxic conditions, along with enzymes that mainly operate under aerobic conditions. Among those enzymes, the genes that encode ChlAII (Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethylester cyclase),40 HO2 (heme oxygenase),41 and HemN (oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase)42 are inducible under micro-oxic conditions, and their expression can be regulated by the MarR-type transcriptional regulator ChlR.43 ChlR is constitutively expressed and exerts positive transcriptional regulation activity under micro-oxic conditions.34 These genes and their regulation are conserved in L. boryana dg5,34 and we could confirm the existence of these genes within the PCC 6306 genome. However, the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome does not encode any of these genes (Fig. 4).Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 may have lost the micro-oxic inducible genes as a consequence of adaptations to more oxidative conditions.3.5. Trehalose-related metabolism of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104Water availability is one of the limiting factors that define the habitat of a microorganism. Compared with aquatic species, terrestrial species are water challenged and must undergo desiccation and rehydration cycles more often. To overcome these environmental stresses, microorganisms use non-reducing sugars, such as sucrose and trehalose. Trehalose is thought to extend desiccation tolerance for many types of organisms,44,45 including cyanobacteria,46 and trehalose content may be one of the factors that defines desiccation tolerance in bacteria. Desiccation-tolerant strains of cyanobacteria accumulate high amounts of trehalose and/or sucrose compared with desiccation-sensitive strains.46,47L. boryana (formerly Plectonema boryanum) has been reported to be desiccation intolerant and accumulate a very small amount of sucrose under desiccation stress conditions.46In cyanobacteria, trehalose is synthesized from glycogen via a-1,1-maltooligosyltrehalose, a reaction that can be catalyzed by maltooligosyl trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.15), which is encoded by the treY gene, and maltooligosyl trehalose trehalohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.141), which is encoded by the treZ gene.48 In a genomic survey of trehalose-related metabolic genes in the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 genome, we could identify a treZY gene cluster; we also found a similar cluster in the L. boryana PCC 6306 genome (Fig. 5). In Nostoc species, treZY genes were followed by the treH gene for a,a-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28), which hydrolyzes a trehalose to two glucoses47,49 (Fig. 5). The organization of treZYH is conserved between heterocystous cyanobacteria, Nostoc, and Anabaena species (Fig. 5). However, we could not identify such organization or any homologous genes for treH in the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 or L. boryana PCC 6306 genomes. Scytonema species, which were isolated from desert soil, have been reported to lack a,a-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) and phosphotrehalase (EC 3.2.1.93) activities and only possesses trehalose phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.64) activity.50 We performed BLAST searches for trehalose phosphorylase against the RAST annotated genome sequences of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306 using the enzymologically characterized trehalose phosphorylase sequence of Thermoanaerobacter brockii ATCC 35047 (GenBank accession number: BAB97299)51,52 as a query. Then, three deduced protein sequences in each Leptolyngbya strain were found to have high similarity with trehalose phosphorylase of T. brockii ATCC 35047 (Table 2). Trehalose might be degraded by these putative trehalose phosphorylases in these Leptolyngbya strains. In addition to the treZY trehalose synthetic gene cluster, we identified treS gene homologues for trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.16) in both the Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 and L. boryana PCC 6306 genomes. TreS can convert maltose into trehalose, or trehalose into maltose, by intramolecular transglucosylation.53,54 In some bacteria, the flux through TreS flows from trehalose to maltose, and the over-expression of TreS causes reductions in cellular trehalose content.55 The function of the protein encoded by the treS homologue is not known in cyanobacteria, and the deduced TreS protein sequences in the two Leptolyngbya strains include a long C-terminal extension compared with TreS of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (NCBI reference sequence accession number: NP_214640). Enzymatic characterization of the treS gene product will be needed to better understand trehalose-related metabolism in these cyanobacteria. Trehalose phosphorylase enzymes in two Leptolyngbya strainsIdentities, positives, and gaps represent the results of a BLAST search, in which trehalose phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ATCC35047 (BAB97299) was used as a query.Trehalose phosphorylase enzymes in two Leptolyngbya strainsIdentities, positives, and gaps represent the results of a BLAST search, in which trehalose phosphorylase from Thermoanaerobacter brockii ATCC35047 (BAB97299) was used as a query.Herein, we found evidence that both aquatic and terrestrial strains (PCC 6306 and NIES-2104) have the genetic capacity to produce trehalose. However, the amount of trehalose that can accumulate in cells of these two strains under desiccation conditions remains unknown. The trehalose content in these strains or regulation of the expression of genes for trehalose synthesis or degradation might be different, and such differences might contribute to differences in desiccation tolerance. Additional physiological studies will be required to test these hypotheses. For Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104, this strain was isolated from a colony of N. commune, so its desiccation tolerance might be enhanced in situ by extracellular polysaccharides derived from the cohabitant N. commune. Indeed, it has been reported that extracellular polysaccharides of terrestrial desiccation-tolerant Nostoc species have important roles in desiccation tolerance, not only for itself, but probably for its cohabitants as well.56,573.6. Genes for UV absorbing sunscreen synthesisOn soil surfaces, microorganisms are challenged by higher amounts of radiation from solar light than in most other environments. Phototrophic organisms use sunlight as an energy source, but are also exposed to harmful UV radiation. To prevent the deleterious effects of UV radiation, they synthesize UV-absorbing sunscreens.58 Mycosporine-like amino acids are UV-absorbing small molecules that are found in many cyanobacterial lineages.59 In cyanobacteria, two types of conserved gene clusters for the synthesis of a mycosporine-like amino acid, shinorine, have been characterized.60,61 These gene clusters each include four genes and share three genes that catalyze the reaction from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate to mycosporine-glycine, mysA (a gene that encodes a 2-demethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthase that acts on sedoheptulose 7-phosphate), mysB (a gene that encodes a O-methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of 2-demethyl-4-deoxygadusol, yielding the common core of mycosporine-like amino acids, 4-deoxygadusol), and mysC (a gene that encodes the protein that catalyzes the condensation of glycine to 4-deoxygadusol). The final step for the synthesis of shinorine differs between the two types, as one is catalyzed by the non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-like protein, and another is catalyzed by the ATP-grasp ligase, which is encoded by the mysD gene. The mycosporine synthesis gene cluster could be found in Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104, but not in L. boryana PCC 6306 (Fig. 6). The mycosporine synthesis gene cluster of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 contains only mysABC, and neither mysD nor the gene for the NRPS-like protein homologue for biosynthesis of shinorine exists in the genome of Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 (Fig. 6). Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 clearly exhibits the genetic capacity to produce mycosporine-glycine. This product might contribute to defence against UV radiation under terrestrial conditions. Furthermore, mycosporine-like amino acids, especially mycosporine-glycine, works both as a sunscreen and as an antioxidant.62 High light irradiation and salt stress accompanied by desiccation can lead to oxidative stresses.63 Mycosporine-glycine might increase fitness under terrestrial conditions by working both as a sunscreen and as an antioxidant.Some cyanobacteria can also synthesize another type of sunscreen, scytonemin58; however, genes for scytonemin synthesis were not identified in either Leptolyngbya strain (NIES-2014 and PCC 6306).3.7. Future prospectsHerein, we discussed the genetic features of L. boryana PCC 6306 and Leptolyngbya sp. NIES-2104 in light of their different habitats. Leptolyngbya is a simple filamentous cyanobacterial genus, and the morphological differences between its species are subtle. The lowest similarity of 16S rDNA sequences among the authentic strains is 91.2% between Leptolyngbya sp. SEV5-3-C28 and Leptolyngbya cf. Albertano–Kovacik green Es Yyy1800 (Supplementary Table S1). This value seems to be too low to support all of the strains included in the clade as genus Leptolyngbya. Although the currently available sequence data and ecological records for this clade are limited, we can now initiate physiological experiments based on the insights yielded by these genomic features. Physiological differences that result from genomic differences could aid in the classification of this clade and provide more credible evidence for ecological differentiation.FundingFunding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.We thank Dr Takafumi Kataoka and MCC staff at NIES for providing technical assistance.

However, it is unclear which taxa and genes in the communities, and how they contribute to the bioremediation in the polluted soils. To get clues about this fundamental question here, time-course (up to 24 weeks) metagenomic analysis of microbial community in a closed soil microcosm artificially polluted with four aromatic compounds, including phenanthrene, was conducted to investigate the changes in the community structures and gene pools. The pollution led to drastic changes in the community structures and the gene sets for pollutant degradation. Complete degradation of phenanthrene was strongly suggested to occur by the syntrophic metabolism by Mycobacterium and the most proliferating genus, Burkholderia. The community structure at Week 24 (~12 weeks after disappearance of the pollutants) returned to the structure similar to that before pollution. Our time-course metagenomic analysis of phage genes strongly suggested the involvement of the ‘kill-the-winner’ phenomenon (i.e. phage predation of Burkholderia cells) for the returning of the microbial community structure. The pollution resulted in a decrease in taxonomic diversity and a drastic increase in diversity of gene pools in the communities, showing the functional redundancy and robustness of the communities against chemical disturbance.1. IntroductionMicrobial communities in natural environments almost always encounter a wide variety of environmental changes (or ‘disturbances,’ in the field of ecology) in physical, chemical, and biological factors.1 It has been well recognized that indigenous microbial communities adapt to such changes through succession of their community structures.2 However, it still remains unclear (i) how the community per se responds to the change of environmental factors and (ii) which member(s) or group(s) and what kinds of genes in the community indeed play important roles in responding to the changes in each environment. Taking into consideration that >99% of environmental microbes are still unculturable under laboratory conditions, application of metagenomic approach has great advantages for investigating the structure and functional potentials of various microbial communities. Numerous ongoing projects involving deep sequencing of a variety of microbiota from different environments are providing a worldwide catalogue of metagenomic characteristics of microbial communities, and subsequent comparison of the characteristics is expected to clarify the environmental factors that govern the taxonomic and functional differences in the microbial communities.3,4 However, real-world environments are often subject to unpredictable and simultaneous changes of multiple physicochemical parameters in addition to frequent migration of organisms. For this reason, it is difficult to use metagenomic analysis of microbiota from natural environments to obtain information on the response of microbial community to the change of a specific environmental factor. Such information can be more definitively obtained by investigating the time-course change of microbiomes in a physically closed experimental ecosystem (i.e. microcosm) than by comparing a collection of ‘snapshots’ of metagenomes from various real-world microbial communities. Although several studies of time-course changes in human gut microbiomes have been reported,5,6 the application of such a strategy to soil environments is still challenging.7,8 This is because soil environments exhibit the most tremendous biodiversity on the Earth.9–11 Our aim of this study under the closed soil microcosm conditions was to investigate which members in a microbial community respond, and in what way, to the addition of chemical pollutants, which was considered as a change of one environmental factor. For this purpose, a closed soil microcosm was artificially amended simultaneously with four recalcitrant aromatic compounds, and the time-course changes in the taxonomic and gene compositions of the soil microbiota were investigated by metagenomic analysis. Our results revealed (i) drastic changes in the community structures and the gene sets for pollutant degradation, (ii) strong suggestion of the complete degradation of one aromatic compound by syntrophic metabolism with the involvement of two phylogenetically distant bacterial phyla, (iii) the return of community structure long after disappearance of the pollutants to the structure similar to that before pollution by the decrease of the most successfully propagated genus most probably through phage predation, and (iv) the redundancy and robustness of functional potentials of the community against the chemical disturbance.2. Materials and methods2.1 Preparation of artificially polluted soil samplesA farm soil (soil type: brown forest soil) at the Ehime Research Institute of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (33°58'42"" N and 132°48'03"" E), in Matsuyama, Japan12 was used in this study, and this soil had not been polluted with harmful aromatic compounds before our sampling. The soil was sampled at depths of 5–10 cm from the surface in April 2008, and large particles were removed with a 2-mm mesh sieve. The soil consisted of 77% sand, 11% of silt, and 12% clay, and was classified as sandy loam. Other physicochemical properties of the soil sample are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The detailed procedure for artificially polluting the soil with four aromatic compounds, 3-chlorobenzoate (3CB), phenanthrene, biphenyl, and carbazole (i.e. 9-azafluerene; an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound), each at a final concentration of 125 mg/kg of wet soil, was described in our previous report.12 Each 200-g portion of the polluted or non-polluted control soil sample was transferred to a sterilized glass pot with a loose lid, and sterilized distilled water was then added to the soil to adjust its water content to 60% of the maximum water-holding capacity. The pots were incubated at 28°C in the dark for up to 24 weeks. Our monitoring of soil samples revealed the <8% changes in the water contents during the 24-week incubation (data not shown). At an appropriate time point after the incubation, all of the soil in each pot was fully harvested to (i) measure the amounts of pollutants, (ii) extract metagenomic DNA, (iii) store the microbial community at -80°C after its suspension in 15% glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide solution, and (iv) store the remaining soil sample at -80°C.2.2 Preparation of metagenomic DNAMetagenomic DNA from 10-g soil sample was prepared by using a PowerMaxTM Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). When the extracted DNA solution contained a large amount of humic substances, they were removed by repeating column purification step according to the protocol by the manufacture. The DNA solution from a total of 20-g soil was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and used for the metagenomic sequencing and the templates for PCR reactions.2.3 Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and their taxonomic analysisThe detailed analysis of the soil microbial communities on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences was performed by the Roche 454 pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons of 16S rRNA genes using 11 metagenomic DNA samples that were prepared from the control and polluted soils as well as the soil just before the pollution. Parts of the 16S rRNA genes [the V3–V4 region (positions from 342 to 806 in the Escherichia coli numbering)] were PCR-amplified using our non-degenerate universal primer set of 342F and 806R (Supplementary Table S2)13 and EX Taq HS polymerase (TAKARA BIO, Ohtsu, Japan). More detailed information on the primer set and PCR conditions has been described in our previous publication.13 After addition of the sequencing adapters A and B, the amplicons were sequenced using a Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium platform (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Our previous protocol was also used to select high-quality 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences (with >350 and <550 bases in lengths) and for their subsequent processing (i.e. alignment to a standard sense strand and removal of primer sequences for pyrosequencing). Sequence clustering of these high-quality reads was conducted using the UCLUST program14 version 6.0.307 with identity of =97% and query and reference coverage of =80%. Chimera clusters detected by the UCHIME program15 in de novo mode and its reference mode [with searching the reference Gold Database (DB) (http://drive5.com/uchime/gold.fa)] were removed. Taxonomic assignment of the resulting Roche 454 reads was performed by using the RDP Classifier program16 version 2.6 with bootstrap value =0.5 against the representative sequences of each 97% sequence cluster that was chosen by the UCLUST program. Unless otherwise stated, the programs for read assemblage and analysis in this study were run under default parameters.2.4 Sequencing of metagenomic DNA using Illumina sequencer and subsequent filtering of low quality and eukaryotic and its viral DNA readsThe 11 soil metagenomic DNA samples (Supplementary Table S3) that were employed for the amplification of 16S rRNA genes and subsequent 454 pyrosequencing were also used for paired-end sequencing by an Illumina GA IIx platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The metagenomic DNA was sheared to 200 bp (on average) by a Covaris-S instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) to construct the DNA library, and its paired-end sequencing with a maximum read length of 75 bases (at the time of sequencing) was carried out using the base-calling pipeline versions 1.3 and 1.5.The Illumina metagenomic reads that were evaluated as being of quality ‘N’ by the chastity filtering in the GA pipeline and those containing more than one nucleotide with the quality flag ‘B’ in the first 60 nucleotides were eliminated. The reads originated from eukaryotes and their viruses were identified as follows. The reads were searched by the BLASTX program17 version 2.2.26 with parameters ‘-e 50 -M PAM30’ against the GenBank-nr DB. The taxonomic origin of each read that fulfilled the parameters was next assigned by the highest BLAST scoring hit with identity =70% and BLAST bit-score =40 against the taxonomy of the database sequence in the NCBI Taxonomy DB (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/). The reads assigned to eukaryotic and eukaryotic viral origins were eliminated. The typical taxonomy nomenclature system is not applied to taxonomy of viruses, and their DNA sequences in the GenBank-nr DB are not associated with their taxonomic description. Therefore, use of only GenBank-nr DB was difficult to identify eukaryotic viral DNA reads in our metagenomic samples. To identify as many such reads as possible, our in-house eukaryotic viral protein sequence DB was constructed by manual removal of archaeal and bacterial virus sequences from the NCBI Virus genome DB (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/all.faa.tar.gz). The resulting in-house database was used for the BLASTX search with the same parameters and thresholds as used for the GenBank-nr DB analysis. When one of the paired-end reads was predicted to be eukaryotic or eukaryotic viral origin, the two reads constituting the paired-reads were eliminated.2.5 Illumina read assembly and protein coding sequences predictionMetagenomic reads from each sample were separately assembled using the IDBA-UD program18 version 1.1.0 with parameters ‘--mink 20 --maxk 70 --step 5’. The protein coding sequences (CDS) in the contigs were predicted by using the MetaGeneMark program19 version 2.10.2.6 Taxonomic and functional assignment of Illumina metagenomic readsFor taxonomic assignment of the Illumina metagenomic reads, a nucleotide sequence similarity search was conducted using the BWA-MEM program20 version 0.7.10 with the strict parameters ‘-k 25 -w 10 -c 100000’ against the draft and complete prokaryote genome sequences in the NCBI DB in December 2013, and the draft sequences of the three Burkholderia strains and one Mycobacterium strain isolated from the polluted soil samples in this study.Functional annotation of each read was performed by BLASTX search with parameters ‘-e 50 -M PAM30’ against the KEGG protein sequence DB21 that was obtained in February 2014. Taxonomic (phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels) and functional [KEGG Orthology (KO)-level] assignment was achieved for the reads that exhibited the highest BLAST scoring hit with identity =70% and BLAST bit-score =40. The KO abundance was calculated by dividing the number of reads belonging to the same KO by the median length of proteins that were annotated to the same KO in the KEGG protein DB. The KEGG pathway abundance was calculated by summing the abundances of KOs belonging to one pathway. To compare the abundances of individual KOs and their pathways among different samples, such abundances in each metagenomic sample were normalized by the number of genomes that were estimated as the average abundance of gyrB and 35 universal single-copy genes (USCGs),22 each of which is carried as a single-copy form by almost all prokaryotic genomes (Supplementary Table S4). (gyrB and USCGs are hereafter described as ‘gyrB-added USCGs’ in this paper.) This method for normalizing functional abundances among the samples was applied to all of the BLAST-based functional assignments in this study.2.7 KEGG-based comparison of Illumina reads among different metagenomic samplesOverall differences in the taxonomic and functional gene compositions among the different samples were analysed by calculating the 1 – Pearson correlation coefficient of abundances of (i) 97% operational taxonomic unit (OTU), (ii) Genus, (iii) KO, and (iv) KEGG pathway among the samples, and were thereafter conducted through hierarchical clustering with the complete linkage algorithm by using the R software.2.8 Comparison of gene pools among samples using all Illumina readsTo analyse overall differences in gene pools among the 11 metagenomic samples, all-against-all BLASTN (version 2.2.26) comparison for 121 pairs of samples (11 samples × 11 samples including self-comparisons) was conducted with parameters ‘-e 0.01’. The functional difference between each pair of samples was analysed by calculating the distance D2, which can normalize such differences by using the BLAST bit-scores of the best hit.25,26 After calculating the D2 values for all pairs of samples, the hierarchical clustering according to the D2 values with the complete linkage algorithm was conducted using the R software.2.9 Construction of in-house protein sequence DB for aromatic compound-degrading enzymes and its use for functional assignment of Illumina metagenomic readsThe KEGG DB lacks a number of genes that have recently been deposited in public databases, and this is also the case with the genes involved in the upstream parts of microbial aerobic and anaerobic degradation routes for the pollutants. Another major inconvenience is that many enzymes for the aerobic degradation, especially those with dioxygenation activities, are encoded by three to four genes, and the substrate specificities of enzymes are determined mainly by the gene products for the terminal dioxygenase, but not by the remaining ones.27 Therefore, we constructed our own in-house DB consisting of amino acid sequences of the enzymes for the following aerobic and anaerobic degradation routes of 3CB, phenanthrene, biphenyl, and carbazole: phenanthrene-phthalate-protocatechuate route, biphenyl-benzoate route, carbazole-anthranilate route, naphthalene-salicylate route, catechol 1,2-and 2,3-dioxygenation route, gentisate route, anaerobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (naphthalene) route, and anaerobic benzoate and toluene route (see Supplementary Table S5 for the reaction steps in each route). Among the protein sequences available as the relevant enzyme names in the NCBI DB (in January 2014), the sequences accompanied by one or more publications about the bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds were first collected as the initial reference sequences of our in-house DB. Protein sequences in two other in-house DBs for the enzymes for degradation of aromatic compounds that were constructed by Vilchez-Vargas et al.28 and Guazzaroni et al.,29 and the protein sequences deposited with relevant KOs in the KEGG DB were also integrated into our DB. The reference sequence collection thus constructed was BLASTP-searched (version 2.2.26) with parameters ‘-e 1e-8 -b 10 -v 10’ and threshold identity =90%, query and reference sequence coverage =70% against the GenBank-nr DB in April 2014. The protein sequences that fulfilled these stringent parameters were incorporated into our final in-house DB (Supplementary Table S6). For the multisubunit enzymes, only the subunits with clearly determined substrate specificities were usually deposited in our database.All the high-quality Illumina metagenomic reads were BLASTX-searched with parameters ‘-e 50 -M PAM30’ against our in-house DB, and the reads with identity =70% and BLAST bit-score =40 in the BLASTX results were collected as candidate-hit reads. These reads were next subjected to BLASTX search against the GenBank-nr DB with parameters ‘-e 50 -M PAM30’, and the reads that were the best hits to the sequences in the final in-house DB were further used for their functional assignment. The abundance of each gene for an aromatic compound-degrading enzyme in a metagenomic sample was normalized by (i) the amino acid length of the enzyme and (ii) the average abundance of the gyrB-added USCGs.2.10 Analysis of phage genes and phage genome-derived contigsIllumina metagenomic reads putatively from phage origins were surveyed using the BLASTX search with parameters ‘-e 50 -M PAM30’ against the ACLAME (A CLAssification of Mobile genetic Elements) phage protein sequence DB30 version 0.4. The abundance of each phage gene in each metagenomic sample was normalized by (i) the length of the phage gene, and (ii) the average abundances of the gyrB-added USCGs, which were calculated from the KEGG analysis.All CDS found in all assembled contigs were BLASTP-searched with the parameter ‘-e 0.001’ against ‘Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs)’ DB31 to find out the contigs from phage genomes. All the Illumina reads that were allocated to such contigs were obtained using the Bowtie 2 program32 version 2.1.0. All such reads from the 11 metagenomic samples were assembled using the IDBA-UD program with parameters ‘--mink 20 --maxk 70 --step 5’ to construct more accurate phage gene-containing contigs. In this study, the ‘putative contigs from the phage genome’ were defined as those that (i) were >2 kb in length, (ii) belonged to the phage genome-related contigs, (iii) contained at least one CDS with an amino acid sequence identity =40% against proteins in the POGs DB, and (iv) contained at least one phage genome-derived region that could be identified using the PHAST (PHAge Search Tool) program.33 This program was also used to analyse their host taxa in which the phages can proliferate, and to evaluate the completeness of the phage genome. The abundance of the phage genome-derived contig DNA in each metagenomic sample was calculated by the numbers of hit reads counted by BLASTN search (100% identity and 100% query coverage) of Illumina metagenomic reads against the phage contigs. The abundance was normalized by the contig length and the numbers of gyrB-added USCGs.Time-course change in abundance of the longest 44.5-kb phage genome-derived contig (Contig70-3) in metagenomic samples was investigated by long-range PCR amplification. Primer sets of PCR for scanning the phage genome were designed using the GenoFrag software34 version 2.1: the primer sets of 1–4 (1F-1R, 2R-2R, 3F-3R, and 4F-4R, respectively) for checking the size of the genome, and the primer set 5 (5F-5R) for checking the presence of circular or concatemer form of phage genome (Supplementary Table S2). The PCR reaction using PrimeSTAR GXL polymerase (TAKARA BIO) and the soil metagenomic DNA samples as the templates was performed under the condition of 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 min. The sizes of the PCR products were determined by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. A quantitative PCR of the phage genome was performed using the primer set 6, 6F-6R (Supplementary Table S2), SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TAKARA BIO), and a DNA engine OpticonTM2 system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA).3. Results and discussion3.1 Overview and preliminary experimentsAccidental pollution of natural environments by harmful aromatic compounds has often occurred by a mixture of various compounds [e.g. various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in petroleum and intermediate products, final products, and by-products from chemical plants], which range from biodegradative to highly persistent compounds. In order to investigate the microbial community-based degradation of such pollutants in natural environments as a model system, a farm soil sample from Ehime, Japan (see Section 2) was artificially polluted with a mixture of four aromatic compounds, 3CB (as a relatively biodegradable monocyclic and chlorinated compound) and carbazole, phenanthrene, and biphenyl (as much more recalcitrant compounds; a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound and PAHs, respectively), each at a concentration of ~1 mM. Each 200-g portion of the polluted and control soil samples was transferred to a sterilized glass pot with a loose lid, generating many experimental pots. These pots were incubated at 28°C in the dark for up to 24 weeks. At an appropriate time point, all the soil harvested from each pot were used to investigate the decrease of pollutants and the number of culturable heterotrophs and to analyse the metagenome of soil microbiota. 3CB began to decrease immediately after the incubation and disappeared within the first 3 weeks. In contrast, carbazole and the two PAHs remained or decreased very slowly during these 3 weeks, then decreased rapidly and constantly, and disappeared at Week 12 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The numbers of colony-formable heterotrophs in the polluted soil samples during the 24-week incubation were similar with those in the control soil samples (Supplementary Fig. S2). On the basis of our preliminary survey of time-course changes in the taxonomic compositions of soil microbial communities in the pots (see Supplementary SN1), 11 soil metagenomic DNA samples were prepared at the time point just before the pollution (at Week 0) (designated 0 hereafter) and at five subsequent time points (at Weeks 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24) from the control (1C, 3C, 6C, 12C, and 24C) and polluted (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 M) soils. These samples were used for (i) the PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and their subsequent sequencing by the Roche 454 system to investigate the time-course changes in the taxonomic compositions, and (ii) paired-end metagenomic sequencing by the Illumina system to investigate the time-course changes in the functional and taxonomic compositions of gene pools.3.2 Time-course taxonomic changes of microbial community members in soilsOur pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons covering the V3–V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes from the 11 metagenomic samples yielded a total of 318,982 high-quality reads (average = 28,998 ± 3,311 per sample) (Supplementary Table S7). Use of the RDP Classifier led to the successful taxonomical assignment of 95.6 and 78.7% (on average) of the reads to phyla and genera, respectively, and the proportions of unassigned taxa at the phylum level were considerably low in the communities from the polluted soil at Weeks 1, 3, and 6 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S7). The number of assigned genera in each sample was ~250, and the proportion of Archaea in each of the 11 communities was <0.1%. The soil microbial community at Week 0 was, similarly to other reported soil microbial communities,10 dominated by the phyla Acidobacteria (especially subgroups Gp4 and Gp6), Verrucomicrobia (especially genus incertae sedis Spartobacteria), and Proteobacteria (Fig. 1B). The community compositions in the control soil changed slightly during the 24-week incubation; the relative abundance of the genus Methylophilus (in Proteobacteria) increased at Weeks 1 and 3, and thereafter decreased. The increase in this methanol-utilizing genus was possibly due to a trace amount of residual methanol in the control soil; to pollute the soil uniformly with 3CB and the remaining very water-insoluble aromatic compounds, the four compounds were dissolved in methanol, which was thereafter removed as much as possible, and the same process without the pollutants was employed for preparation of the control soil (see Section 2). On the other hand, very drastic and complicated changes in the microbial community members, especially those in Proteobacteria, were observed in the polluted soil. Time-course changes in the relative abundance of the top 30 abundant genera (including genera incertae sedis) were further investigated by hierarchical clustering analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3), giving rise to four clusters (Clusters 1–4) on the basis of co-occurrence patterns. The genera that were dominant members at Week 0 but became minor ones immediately after the pollution belonged to Cluster 1, and only one-third of them (represented by Acidobacteria Gp4 and Spartobacteria) regained their dominance after Week 12. The genera belonging to Cluster 2 (e.g. Sphingomonas, Bradyrhizobium, and subgroup Gp1 in Acidobacteria) increased in their relative abundances after the disappearance of carbazole and the two PAHs. The remaining two clusters consisted of the genera that transiently increased in their relative abundances at Week 1 (e.g. Burkholderia and Pseudomonas in Cluster 4) and at Weeks 3 and 6 (e.g. Dyella, Dongia, Mycobacterium, TM7, and several anaerobes in Cluster 3). The genera in the last two clusters include various well-characterized aromatic compound-degrading strains,35 suggesting their direct or indirect involvement in the degradation of pollutants. The increase in relative abundances of 16S rRNA genes in the soil DNA samples did not definitively confirm the proliferation of their host cells in the soil environment. Since the three genera, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Mycobacterium, were noteworthy taxa in the Illumina analysis of the metagenome (see below), the absolute abundances of their 16S rRNA genes in the control and polluted soil metagenomic samples were measured by quantitative PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4). The copy number of the 16S rRNA gene from each genus thus determined was in good agreement (Pearson correlations >0.90, P-value <0.01) with the relative abundance of the corresponding genus that was estimated by the assignment of 16S rRNA genes from the Roche 454 reads. This indicates that at least the three genera indeed proliferated in the polluted soil. Phylum- and genus-level taxonomical succession of microbial communities in control and polluted soils. PCR amplicons of V3–V4 regions in the 16S rRNA genes from metagenomic samples were pyrosequenced, and taxonomically assigned by the RDP classifier (see the text for details). (A) Phylum-level succession. (B) Genus-level succession. C and M: metagenomic samples from the control and polluted soils, respectively. The numerals before C and M are the weeks after the pollution.

Taxa with asterisks are genera incertae sedis.Analysis of the changes in abundance of the top 30 genera throughout the 24-week time course did not conclusively reveal whether the microbial community in the polluted soil was still fluctuating at Week 24. However, our analysis of overall differences in the 16S rRNA gene compositions (at the 97% OTU level) among the 11 samples revealed that the community compositions of the polluted soil at Weeks 12 and 24 were (i) more similar to that at Week 0 than those at Weeks 1, 3, and 6, but (ii) still different from that at Week 0 (Fig. 2A). This implies that the microbial taxonomic compositions in the polluted soil tended to slowly, but not completely, return to that at Week 0. Such a gradual mode of return was more clearly observed in the case of the control soil. The resilience of microbial community compositions after environmental changes has been observed ubiquitously in various other environments, and the return to original compositions sometimes requires much longer periods (e.g. more than several years).1,2,36Hierarchical clustering analysis of taxonomic and functional compositions of 11 soil metagenomic samples. Clustering of (A) taxonomic compositions of 97% OTUs of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, and (B) functional compositions of genes for KEGG KO-assigned proteins was performed by comparison of the Euclidean distances. See the text for details.Hierarchical clustering analysis of taxonomic and functional compositions of 11 soil metagenomic samples.

See the text for details.3.3 Time-course changes of microbial gene pools in soilsThe 11 soil DNA samples used for the pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes were also used for the metagenomic sequencing by the Illumina platform with a maximum read length of 75 bases (at the time of sequencing). The total number of reads from the 11 samples was 413 million (Supplementary Table S8). The total number of high-quality reads with >60 bases in lengths was ~125 million (ranging from 7.3- to 14.4-million reads in each of the 11 samples), generating ~9.3 Gb of sequences. Taxonomic and functional assignments of the Illumina-based metagenomic sequences in most other studies have been carried out after the assembly of reads.21,37 Therefore, our Illumina reads were assembled using the IDBA-UD software18 in order to obtain the contigs. The contig N50 median lengths from the 11 samples were very short (331–683 bases) (Supplementary Fig. S5), and only 205 and 9 contigs of >5 kb in length were obtained from the polluted and control soil samples, respectively. Our CDS prediction by the MetaGeneMark program generated a total of 3,333 CDS from the 214 contigs, and the subsequent BLASTP search against the GenBank-nr DB revealed that 3,095 CDS showed <50% identities (at the amino acid sequence level) with the functionally known genes or were assigned as hypothetical CDS (Supplementary Table S9). These results were consistent with the diverse taxonomic compositions of microbiota in our soil samples. Among the 63 CDS (32 and 31 CDS from polluted and control soils, respectively) that showed >70% identities (at the amino acid sequence level) with functionally annotated genes in the GenBank-nr DB, 15 CDS from the polluted soil samples were assigned to phage origins (see below for more details about the analysis of phage-inferred contigs), and the remaining 17 CDS were considered to have non-phage origins (e.g. genes for nucleotide metabolisms and ABC transporters). Most contigs from the control soil samples were probably the genome fragments derived from methylotrophs (Supplementary Table S9), and appeared not to encode the functions either directly or indirectly involved in the degradation of pollutants.Because we obtained a huge number of very short contigs and only a small number of long contigs, the Illumina high-quality short reads were used for subsequent analysis. To evaluate the accuracy of the assignment of such short Illumina reads, a computer simulation experiment was conducted. The simulation of artificial 60-base ‘Illumina’ reads generated from the Sanger read data of a Minnesota soil microbiome9 revealed that identical assignments between the artificial Illumina data reads and their parental Sanger data reads at the phylum and KO levels were obtained with probabilities of 72 and 92%, respectively (Supplementary Table S10). These results reinforced the validity of our assignment of metagenomic sequences by using the Illumina short reads.Taxonomic and functional assignment of the Illumina high-quality reads was performed by BLASTX search using the KEGG, GenBank-nr, and ACLAME DBs. The BLASTX search using the KEGG DB under the conditions of identity =70% and bit-score =40 led to the successful assignment of putative gene functions for 29% of the reads on average (ranging from 24 to 35%) (Supplementary Table S11 for gene abundance of each KO-assigned protein). Our analysis of overall differences in the relative abundances of genes for KO-assigned proteins among the 11 metagenomic DNA samples showed that the gene compositions at Weeks 1, 3, and 6 in the polluted soil samples formed a cluster very different from another cluster that was organized by the compositions from the remaining samples (Fig. 2B), indicating that the gene pools changed drastically in response to the chemical spike. Several metagenomic analyses of microbes in other real-world polluted soils also reported such changes in the gene pools.29,38 The gene compositions at Weeks 12 and 24 in our polluted samples were still different from that at Week 0 and those in the control samples. The overall relationship among the compositions of the genes for KO-assigned proteins (by the Illumina sequencing) in the 11 metagenomic samples was shown to have some similarity to the overall relationship among the compositions of 16S rRNA genes (by pyrosequencing) (Fig. 2). This implies that not only the taxonomic but also the gene compositions of the polluted soil microbiota tended to slowly return to those at Week 0. All the high-quality Illumina reads, including the functionally unassigned ones, were further compared among the 11 metagenomic DNA samples by the all-against-all BLASTN analysis, and subsequent clustering analysis exhibited that the gene compositions at Weeks 12 and 24 in the polluted soil were still distinct from that at Week 0 (Supplementary Fig. S6). The difference in the clustering patterns between all the reads and only the KO-assigned reads was likely ascribable to the biased property of KEGG DB, since this DB was constructed by using mainly the organisms for which complete genome sequences were available.The time-course changes in the taxonomic and functional diversities of metagenomic samples were investigated by the Shannon-Wiener indices. Although the pollution of soil led to a decrease in the diversity index of the taxonomic compositions of the microbial community (Fig. 3A), it also gave rise to a drastic increase in the diversity of the genes for KO-assigned proteins (Fig. 3B). This increase was most plausibly ascribable to the two most proliferating genera, Burkholderia and Pseudomonas, in the early weeks after the pollution. These bacteria have large genome sizes, and are well recognized to carry a number of genes apparently unique to these genera, especially for the catabolic genes for various aromatic compounds.39–41 A recent comparative metagenomic analysis of different microbiota from various tallgrass prairie soils indicated a positive correlation between the taxonomic and functional diversities of microbiomes.42 The difference between our closed soil microcosm samples and the real-world prairie soils may have been related to differences in environmental factors (chemical disturbance and physicochemical factors, respectively) or differences in the biological factors of the resident microbes. Time-course changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of metagenomes in control and polluted soils. (A) Taxonomic diversity. (B) Functional diversity. Open and closed circles: control and polluted soils, respectively. The Shannon-Wiener indices (H') for taxonomic and functional diversities of the metagenomic samples were calculated from the compositions of 97% OTUs of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons and the compositions of genes for KO-assigned proteins, respectively.Time-course changes in taxonomic and functional diversity of metagenomes in control and polluted soils. (A) Taxonomic diversity. (B) Functional diversity. Open and closed circles: control and polluted soils, respectively. The Shannon-Wiener indices (H') for taxonomic and functional diversities of the metagenomic samples were calculated from the compositions of 97% OTUs of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons and the compositions of genes for KO-assigned proteins, respectively.In order to investigate what types of genes were enriched and correlated with one another during the drastic change in the gene compositions mentioned above, time-course variation patterns of KEGG pathway-level gene abundances (each of which was calculated by summing up the abundances of all genes for KO-assigned proteins in one pathway) were analysed by conducting k-means clustering. This analysis led to categorization of the pathway-level variation patterns into two clusters, designated M1 and M2 (Supplementary Table S12 and Fig. S7); while the pathway-level gene abundances for cluster M1 apparently remained constant during the 24-week incubation, those for cluster M2 oscillated drastically (a drastic increase at Week 1 followed by a rapid decrease at Week 3, and a slight re-increase at Week 6) and were well correlated with the degradation events of the pollutants. Of the 146 prokaryote-derived pathways (see Section 2), 100 pathways that include many core metabolic pathways were classified into cluster M1. The finding that there were no apparent variations in the abundance of genes for the core metabolic pathways in spite of the decrease in taxonomic diversity (Fig. 3A) might have been due to the functional redundancy of the genes for these common core pathways2,43,44 that were shared by the soil microbial members at Week 0 and the members at the weeks after the pollution. These results are in good agreement with other metagenomic studies that have addressed the degree of functional redundancy among the different human-associated microbial community compositions.3 The remaining 46 pathways belonged to cluster M2, which contains most of the degradation pathways of aromatic compounds (e.g. benzoate) as well as the pathways for the catabolism of aromatic amino acids and cell surface-related functions (i.e. cell motility, ABC-type transporters, and various secretion systems). The apparently synchronous variation patterns between the genes for the pollutant-degradation pathways and those for other functional groups (e.g. cell surface-related functions) in cluster M2 in the polluted soil might have been due to the genome structures of pollutant-degrading prokaryotes (and non-degrading and co-resident prokaryotes) that also possess the genes for the latter groups of pathways. In the control soil, the abundance of the genes that were assigned to the M2 cluster in the polluted soil oscillated slightly with the different patterns (Supplementary Table S13 and Fig. S7).3.4 Time-course changes of microbial pollutant-degrading genes in soilsThe change in the gene pools directly involved in the degradation of the pollutants was investigated using our in-house DB, which includes many amino acid sequences for the enzymes deposited recently in public DBs and those catalyzing aerobic and anaerobic degradation of the pollutants (see Section 2 and Supplementary Table S5). Our BLAST search of the high-quality Illumina reads against the in-house and GenBank-nr DBs (see Section 2) revealed that 66,433 reads most plausibly carried parts of genes for the degradation of pollutants. These reads were used to calculate the abundances and phylum-level taxonomic origins of the genes for the degradation reaction steps (Fig. 4; see also Supplementary Figs S8 and S9 for more comprehensive data). Our computer simulation of artificial ‘Illumina’ reads from the soil microbiome mentioned above indicated their ambiguous annotation of the short metagenomic reads at the genus level; the assignment accuracy was 34% for these reads. To clarify more accurately the genus-level taxonomic origins of the 66,433 metagenomic reads, nucleotide sequence similarity search was conducted for these reads using complete and draft prokaryote genome sequences (from 2,719 and 6,974 strains, respectively) in the NCBI DB and the draft sequences of three Burkholderia strains and one Mycobacterium strain that were isolated in this study from the polluted soil (see Supplementary SN2). This analysis revealed that the metagenomic reads whose origins were assigned to Burkholderia and Mycobacterium in the in-house DB exhibited the same taxonomic assignment with probabilities of 72 and 69%, respectively (Supplementary Table S14), indicating appropriate taxonomic assignments of the metagenomic reads at least for these two genera. The drastic increase in the abundance of Burkholderia-type genes for benzoate 1,2-dioxygenases (BpG; see Supplementary Table S5 for abbreviations of enzymes) (Fig. 4), which have also been indicated to convert 3CB to chlorinated catechol,45 coincided well with the relative abundance of Burkholderia cells (on the basis of community analysis by 16S rRNA gene profiling) as well as the rapid decrease of 3CB at Week 1. These data strongly suggested an important role of Burkholderia-type benzoate 1,2-dioxygenases in the degradation of 3CB. This suggestion was further supported by our preliminary transplantation experiment, in which the polluted soil-derived microbial population was inoculated into the sterilized soil; there was a rapid and drastic increase of Burkholderia after the pollution of the sterilized soil amended with 3CB (our unpublished observation). Another study on 3CB-amended soil also reported its degradation mainly by Burkholderia.46 It is noteworthy that the drastic increase of Burkholderia-type genes was observed in other reaction steps, such as phthalate 4,5-dioxygenation (P45J) (Fig. 4) and salicylate 1-hydroxylation (NG) at Week 1, at which time point no rapid degradation of the three other pollutants was observed. This simultaneous enrichment of degradation genes was most likely due to a common genomic feature of the genus Burkholderia; many of Burkholderia strains so far investigated encode the enzymes for the phthalate degradation route by its 4,5-dioxygenation (P45J) and for NG (note that salicylate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate can be catabolized by the same enzyme39,47,48). The taxonomic compositions of aerobic degradation genes in the polluted soil at Week 6 indicated that an actinobacterial genus, Mycobacterium, was the most plausible contributor to the initial dioxygenation step of phenanthrene (PA) and the subsequent degradation to protocatechaute through the 3,4-dioxygenation sub-route of phthalate (P34J to P34L)49 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S9), although the highest abundance of this genus in the communities of the polluted soil was 1% (on the basis of the16S rRNA gene profiling) at Week 6. The 4,5-dioxygenation sub-route from phthalate and a branching sub-route from 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (NG) were suggested to be mediated by the involvement of Proteobacteria, especially Betaproteobacteria. The genes for these sub-routes apparently showed biphasic response patterns in their abundances (increases at Weeks 1 and 6). Taking all of these observations into account, it is likely that the intermediate metabolites (e.g. phthalate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate) of the mycobacterial degradation of phenanthrene in the soil were released to the extracellular environment50 and utilized by a variety of co-resident microbial groups. There are indeed several reports of syntrophic associations between two phyla for the complete degradation of recalcitrant compounds.51 A Mycobacterium strain, EPa45, with the ability to degrade phenanthrene to TCA compounds, was isolated from the polluted soil at Week 15. Our genome sequencing of EPa45 suggested its phenanthrene degradation to protocatechaute52 via the same route as used for mycobacterial phenanthrene degradation that was proposed by the Illumina metagenomic read analysis. The numbers of metagenomic reads that hit the well-known genes for the initial dioxygenation enzymes for biphenyl (BpA) and carbazole (CA) were quite small (<16 hit reads at Week 6), and this was consistent with the undetectable level of such genes in the metagenomic samples by PCR analysis (Supplementary SN1). These results suggested the involvement of as-yet-unknown gene(s) and metabolic pathway(s) for the degradation of the two aromatic compounds. Involvement of anaerobic degradation pathways was also ambiguous in the functional analysis of the metagenomic reads.

More detailed results at the overall pathway map level by using the metagenomic samples from the control and polluted soils are depicted in Supplementary Figs S8 and S9.3.5 Time-course change of bacteriophage genesOur BLASTX analysis of Illumina read-derived long contigs against the GenBank-nr DB suggested that some such contigs in the metagenomic samples from the polluted soil were originated from phage genomes (see above). More detailed BLASTX search of Illumina reads against the ACLAME DB indicated that the relative abundance of total phage DNA reads in the polluted soil increased at Weeks 3 and 6 (Fig. 5A), supporting the notion of an increase in prophage-carrying microbes and/or phage particles in the soil. Therefore, we further searched and analysed the phage gene-derived Illumina reads and their contigs (see Section 2.10). Among the re-assembled contigs from the Illumina metagenomic reads, 58 contigs had at least one CDS that showed >40% identity (at the amino acid sequence level) with phage CDS in the POGs DB (Supplementary Table S15), and these contigs were subjected to the PHAST analysis.33 This analysis revealed that (i) phage genome-derived regions were identified in eight large (15.6–93.6 kb) contigs, (ii) such contigs possessed many genes derived from Pseudomonas and Burkholderia phages, and (iii) a set of genes found in the 44.5-kb contig (Contig70-3) were evaluated as an ‘intact phage’ while the remaining contigs were evaluated as ‘incomplete phages’ (Supplementary Table S16). The BLASTN search of the Illumina reads from each of 11 metagenomic samples against the above-described 8 contigs was conducted to examine their quantitative time-course changes. This search showed an extensive increase of all 8 contigs at Week 3 or 6 only in the polluted soil (by 103 to 104 times greater than those at Week 0) and a subsequent decrease at Week 12, implying that replication of the phage genomes occurred around Weeks 3 and 6 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S10). Our BLASTN search of all high-quality Illumina reads against the 8 contigs revealed that the Illumina hit reads were evenly distributed across the whole range of each contig, suggesting that the 8 contigs were not the chimeras that were artificially generated at our assemblage stage. Further analysis of Contig70-3 exhibited moderate (at most 45% at the BLASTX search level) similarity with the genome of a Burkholderia phage (Supplementary Table S16), BcepGomr (GI: 145321088), of soil origin.53,54 Our investigation of the relative abundances of the Illumina reads that corresponded to parts of Contig70-3 in each of 11 metagenomic samples indicated that such reads extensively increased only in the polluted soil (1.7 × 104-fold increase at Week 6 compared with Week 1) (Fig. 5B). It is noteworthy that the relative abundance of the genomic DNA of Burkholderia in the polluted soil was the greatest at Week 1 (23-fold higher at this week than at Week 0). This result shows that there was temporal and numerical asynchrony between the relative abundances of the phage genome contig and its putative host genome. The metagenomic DNA sample at Week 6 from the polluted soil was used to PCR-amplify various Contig70-3-derived phage genome fragments, and we were able to detect (i) the amplicons of the phage-derived fragments of expected sizes and (ii) the phage genome structure with circular or concatemer form (Supplementary Fig. S11c). Quantitative PCR also confirmed the extensive increase of the phage genome at Week 6 in the polluted soil (Supplementary Fig. S11d). One plausible reason for the asynchrony is phage predation of Burkholderia cells around Week 6. Analysis of other long contigs also suggested that a similar situation was the case between Pseudomonas and its putative phages, although in silico analysis suggested that the phage-inferred contigs were not long enough to ‘intact’ phage genomes. Phage predation of successfully proliferating microbes, known as the ‘kill-the-winner’ hypothesis, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms underlying the compositional stability of microbial communities, and the involvement of this mechanism has been supported in aquatic environments.55 Our present findings strongly suggested that phage predation targeting the most successfully proliferating microbe (Burkholderia in this case) also contributed to the stabilization of our soil microbial community structure. It is unclear at present (i) what molecular mechanism(s) are involved in this phenomenon and (ii) whether such phages have lysogenic or lytic lifestyles.

The abundance of Contig70-3 DNA in each sample was based on the numbers of hit reads counted in BLASTN search of the metagenomic reads against Contig70-3, whereas the abundance of Burkholderia genomic DNA was based on the numbers of hit reads taxonomically assigned to Burkholderia by BLASTX search against the KEGG DB. The hit numbers in both cases were normalized by the number of gyrB-added USCGs in each metagenomic sample.

This approach strongly suggested the biphasic degradation of 3CB and phenanthrene: immediate degradation of the former compound mainly by Burkholderia and the delayed degradation of the latter one syntrophically by two phyla. Such suggestion was further supported by our traditional and molecular microbiological analysis as well as genomic analysis of relevant strains isolated from the polluted soil.Systems biology has proposed that the robustness of biological systems at various levels is achieved by feedback control, fail-safe by means of diversity, and modularity.43 This proposal could be apparently applied to the microbiota in our closed soil microcosm: i.e. phage-mediated decrease of the most successfully propagated Burkholderia cells, functional redundancy of microbiota, and syntrophic degradation of pollutants, respectively. Although the proposal described above has been in part applicable to a few microbial communities such as anaerobic aquatic microbiota,56 it has not yet been investigated whether this is the case with soil microbiota. Our time-series metagenomic analysis of the closed soil microcosm polluted with aromatic compounds contributes to clarifying robustness of the soil microbial community against the chemical spike.There existed over 250 genera in the soil at Week 0. Although some genera in the polluted soil showed drastic time-course changes in their relative abundances, most other genera only exhibited a ‘slight’ response to the pollution with no apparent increase or decrease. The ecological function of such ‘silent audiences’ in our microbial community remains to be explored. It is still unclear whether or not the increases in the degradation genes in our soil were followed by their expression for the degradation of pollutants. Time-course analysis of microbial communities using a combination of metagenomics with metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics, as well as other analyses (e.g. use of the stable isotope probing technique29,57), will greatly contribute to evaluation of the ecological functions of microbial genes at the community level.4.

Therefore, the identification of genomic neutral sites for the stable integration of ectopic DNA is required to ensure a successful outcome. Here we describe the genome mapping and validation of five neutral sites in the chromosome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, foreseeing the use of this cyanobacterium as a photoautotrophic chassis. To evaluate the neutrality of these loci, insertion/deletion mutants were produced, and to assess their functionality, a synthetic green fluorescent reporter module was introduced. The constructed integrative vectors include a BioBrick-compatible multiple cloning site insulated by transcription terminators, constituting robust cloning interfaces for synthetic biology approaches. Moreover, Synechocystis mutants (chassis) ready to receive purpose-built synthetic modules/circuits are also available. This work presents a systematic approach to map and validate chromosomal neutral sites in cyanobacteria, and that can be extended to other organisms.1. IntroductionMicroorganisms have been widely used in biotechnological applications to produce added-value products.1 The Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most commonly used, but others such as the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have also been successfully exploited.2,3 Heterotrophic organisms require supplementation of the growth medium with external carbon sources increasing production costs; therefore, autotrophic organisms emerge as a valid alternative.4 In this context, cyanobacteria are promising ‘low-cost’ cell factories since they can use CO2 as carbon source, water as reducing power, light as energy source and some strains are even able to fix atmospheric N2 (nitrogen source). These organisms are found in almost any ecological niche on Earth,5 which reflects their high degree of metabolic plasticity. Among cyanobacteria, the unicellular non-N2-fixing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (henceforth referred to as Synechocystis) is the most studied strain, and the large amount of genomic, proteomic and physiological information generated over the years allowed the construction of genome-scale models, enabling the prediction of the system behavior.6 Moreover, it was the first photosynthetic organism to have its genome sequenced,7 comprising a 3.6 Mb chromosome and 7 plasmids (http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis), it is naturally transformable and a number of molecular tools are available for its genetic manipulation.4,8,9 Altogether, these characteristics allow for the exploitation of Synechocystis as a photoautotrophic biotechnological platform. In contrast to E. coli, for which several replicative plasmids from different compatibility groups are available, these tools are limited for Synechocystis.8–10 Instead, integrative vectors are usually used to implement new functionalities, integrating ectopic DNA into the genome through homologous recombination.11 To date, a few integration sites in Synechocystis' genome have been used,11–15 although most of them have not been extensively characterized as neutral sites—loci that can be disrupted without affecting cellular viability or cause any distinguishable phenotype.16 Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to identify and characterize genomic neutral sites would greatly improve the ability to introduce new functionalities into Synechocystis.In this work, a set of neutral sites in the chromosome of Synechocystis has been identified and characterized. It presents a systematic approach to map and validate neutral sites in the genome of an organism, foreseeing its use as a photoautotrophic chassis for industrial applications. Moreover, the new integrative vectors have been designed to be compatible with the BioBrick™ RFC[10] standard (http://www.biobricks.org/), which will make easier to use Synechocystis in synthetic biology approaches. The availability of several integration loci, spread throughout the cyanobacterium chromosome, will allow the implementation of complex synthetic circuits into this platform. Furthermore, the strategy reported here can be easily extended to other organisms/chassis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Organisms and maintenance culture conditionsWild type and mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrain Kazusa17,18 were maintained in BG11 medium19 at 25°C, under a 16 h light/8 h dark regimen. Light intensity was 20 µmol photons m-2 s-1 in all experiments. For solid medium, BG11 was supplemented with 1.5% (wt/vol) noble agar (Difco), 0.3% (wt/vol) sodium thiosulfate and 10 mM TES-KOH buffer, pH 8.2. For the selection and maintenance of mutants, BG11 medium was supplemented with kanamycin (Km, 10–600 µg ml-1). All the characterization experiments were performed in the absence of selective pressure. For cloning purposes, E. coli strain DH5a (Stratagene) was used. Escherichia coli cells were grown at 37°C on LB medium,20 supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg ml-1) or kanamycin (50 µg ml-1).2.2. BioinformaticsThe list of the predicted/annotated ORFs of Synechocystis was retrieved from CyanoBase (Distribution of Sequence and Annotated Data Files, ftp://ftp.kazusa.or.jp/pub/CyanoBase/Synechocystis, accessed: 08 May 2009). From the 3,264 ORFs listed, only those putatively encoding unknown or hypothetical proteins were selected. From these, the final selection was based on the following criteria: (i) length of the putatively encoded proteins =301 amino acids, (ii) encoded proteins with no transmembrane domains predicted by the TMHMM Server v. 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), (iii) no interaction with other proteins as assessed by the two-hybrid system (CyanoBase data) and (iv) no relevant similarities found at the protein sequence level, when comparing with other sequences using BLASTP (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The genomic context of the ORFs was also taken into consideration, and sites were disregarded when in the vicinity of genes with assigned putative functions (see Fig. 1). To assess transcription of the selected ORFs, primers were designed automatically from the genomic sequence7 using the Beacon Designer 6 software (PREMIER Biosoft International). For other purposes, primers were designed manually and analysed using the Integrated DNA Technologies web resource OligoAnalyzer v3.1 (http://eu.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/).

DNA and RNA extractionCyanobacterial genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction was carried out according to the procedure described previously.21 For RNA extraction, Synechocystis cells were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 3,850 g) and frozen at -80°C. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the method described previously.222.4. RT-PCR for target ORFs transcription analysisTo assess target ORFs transcription, RNA was extracted from Synechocystis cells cultivated to an OD730 of 0.8–0.9, under continuous light at 30°C. Further transcriptional studies were performed with RNA extracted from samples collected in three different growth phases (OD730 of ~0.4, 2 and 9, see Fig. 2), from three independent cultures grown under the same conditions. RT-PCRs were carried out as described elsewhere.23 Briefly, cDNA was synthesized in duplicate from 1 µg of total RNA using the iScript™ Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and the random primers supplied, following the manufacturer's instructions. The two RT reactions from each sample were pooled together and each PCR reaction contained 1.5 µl of cDNA, 0.1 µM of each primer (Supplementary Table S1), 200 µM dNTPs mix, 1× PCR reaction buffer and 0.025 U of illustra™ Taq DNA polymerase (GE Healthcare). The PCR profile was as follows: 2 min at 94°C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 50°C and 30 s at 72°C, concluding with a 7-min extension step at 72°C. RNA contamination by gDNA prior to cDNA synthesis was assessed by PCR using primers specific for the Synechocystis 16S rDNA, and the RT reaction efficiency was assessed using the same primers pair. All the RT-PCRs included a negative control (omission of template) and a positive control (Synechocystis gDNA).

Homologous regions amplification and fusion by PCRPCRs to amplify the regions flanking the target loci (see below) contained 7 ng of gDNA, 0.2 µM of each primer, 250 µM dNTPs mix, 1× Pfu reaction buffer with MgSO4 and 0.025 U of Pfu DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The PCR profile was as follows: 1 min at 94°C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 48°C and 90 s at 72°C, concluding with a 7-min extension step at 72°C. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed by standard protocols using 1× TAE buffer;20 DNA fragments were purified using the GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's instructions. ‘Overlap-PCRs’ (see below) contained 80 ng of each purified DNA fragment, 0.125 µM of each primer, 250 µM dNTPs mix, 1× PCR reaction buffer and 0.025 U of illustra™ Taq DNA polymerase (GE Healthcare). The PCR profile was: 5 min at 95°C followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 45 s at 48°C and 90 s at 72°C, and 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 45 s at 55°C and 90 s at 72°C, concluding with a 7-min extension step at 72°C. The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the homologous regions are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.6. Plasmid constructionThe plasmids used to produce the Synechocystis mutants were constructed following a rational design (Supplementary Fig. S1). For this purpose, the chromosomal regions up and downstream of the target loci (Supplementary Table S3) were amplified by PCR using the Pfu polymerase and primers containing tags with restriction sites for cloning purposes (Nn.5O/Nn.5I and Nn.3O/Nn.3I, Supplementary Table S2). The corresponding up and downstream fragments of each locus were fused by ‘overlap-PCR’, using the Taq polymerase (see above). The resulting products were cloned into the pGEM®-T easy vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, originating the pSNn* plasmids series (n for ‘neutral site number’). The pGEM®-T easy vector restriction sites incompatible with the BioBrick RFC[10] standard were eliminated by digesting the vector with XhoI and SalI and recircularizing the vector (originating the pSNn** series). The BioBrick RFC[10] standard incompatible restriction sites within the amplified chromosomal regions of pSN5** and pSN10** were eliminated using the QuikChange® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the primers N5_SDM and N10_SDM, respectively (Supplementary Table S2), originating the pSN5*** and the pSN10*** plasmids. A BioBrick-compatible cloning interface was synthesized (Epoch Life Science Inc.), containing the MunI, XbaI, NotI, SpeI and PstI restriction sites flanked by two double transcription terminators (based on the registry parts BBa_B1006, BBa_B0062, BBa_B0053 and BBa_B0020). This interface was excised from the delivery vector (pBSK-FP300) using XmaI and AgeI and subsequently cloned into the XmaI site of the pSNn** or pSNn*** plasmids, originating the pSNn plasmid series (Supplementary Fig. S1). Afterwards, two selection cassettes, one containing the nptII gene (encoding a neomycin phosphotransferase that confers resistance to neomycin and kanamycin) and the sacB gene (encoding a levansucrase that confers sucrose sensitivity), and another containing only the nptII gene, were amplified by PCR from the plasmid pK18mobsacB,24 using the primer pairs Km.KmScFwd/KmScRev and Km.KmScFwd/KmRev, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). These selection cassettes were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector, excised with XmaI and cloned into the XmaI site of the pSNn plasmid series. The final plasmid series containing only the Km-resistance cassette was named pSNnK, and the plasmid series containing the cassette with the two selective markers was named pSNnKS. Additionally, based on previous works,25,26 the minimal promoter sequence required for Synechocystis psbA2 basal transcription (-38 to +14 bp (base-pairs); +1 corresponding to the transcription start site) was synthesized (PpsbA2*), meeting the BioBrick RFC[10] standard specifications (DNA 2.0 Inc.). This promoter region was cloned into the BioBrick vector pSB1A2 containing the part BBa_E0240 (composed by the RBS part BBa_B0032, the GFP-coding gene part BBa_E0040 and the double transcription terminator part BBa_B0015), according to the BioBrick standard cloning procedure. The BioBrick composite part BBa_E0240 (promoterless GFP generator) and the part with the synthetic constitutive promoter PpsbA2* were digested with XbaI and SpeI and cloned into the XbaI site of both pSNn and pSNnK series, originating the pSNnK.gfp and pSNnK.Cgfp plasmid series (C for ‘constitutive promoter’). These plasmids were used to assess proper cloning interface transcriptional insulation (promoterless gfp) and functionality of the neutral sites (gfp under the control of the constitutive promoter). The vectors were named as follows: P for ‘plasmid’, S for ‘Synechocystis’, N for ‘neutral site’, n for the ‘number of the neutral site’ (5, 8, 10, 15 or 16), K for ‘kanamycin resistance cassette’, KS for the ‘double selection cassette (KmR/SucS)’, C for ‘constitutive PpsbA2* promoter’ and gfp for the ‘GFP generator BioBrick part BBa_E0240’. Plasmids DNA was isolated from overnight grown E. coli cultures, using the GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the BioBrick parts can be found at the Registry of Standard Biological Parts website (http://parts.igem.org), and the maps and sequences (FASTA format) of the final plasmids are available as Supplementary Figs S2–S26.2.7. Generation of Synechocystis mutantsSynechocystis was transformed based on the procedure described previously.11 Briefly, Synechocystis was grown in standard conditions to an OD730 ˜ 0.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 3,850 g) and resuspended in BG11 to a final OD730 ˜ 2.5. The purified plasmids were incubated for 5 h with 500 µl of those cells (final plasmid DNA concentration of 20 µg ml-1), in light and at 25°C. Cells were then spread onto Immobilon™-NC membranes (0.45 µm pore size, 82 mm, Millipore) resting on solid BG11 plates, grown in standard growth conditions and transferred to selective plates after 24 h (Km, 10 µg ml-1). Transformants were observed after 1–2 weeks. For complete segregation, Km-resistant colonies were grown at increasing Km concentrations (25 and 50 µg ml-1) and finally transferred into liquid medium. The mutant full segregation was confirmed by PCR, using primers within and external to each site (Nn.FI/Nn.RI or Nn.FO/KmRev, respectively; Supplementary Table S2), and by Southern blot with probes labeled with digoxigenin using the DIG DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and following the manufacturer's instructions. The probes were obtained by labeling the PCR-amplified 3' homologous regions for mutants in sites N5, N8, N10 and N16, and the 5' homologous region for mutants in site N15 (Supplementary Table S2). gDNA digestions were performed with MunI, with the exception of N8 mutants for which the gDNA was digested with SpeI. When necessary antibiotic concentration was increased up to 600 µg ml-1 to fully segregate the mutants.2.8. Growth experimentsFor the growth experiments, 50 ml of BG11 medium was inoculated with Synechocystis wild type or SNnK mutants to OD730 ˜ 0.3. The cultures were grown to OD730 ˜ 1.0, under the experimental light regimen (continuous light or 12 h light/12 h dark cycles) and subsequently diluted to a final OD730 ˜ 0.1 in fresh BG11. Ten millilitres of each diluted culture was transferred to sterile 25-ml borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flasks, closed with cellulose stopper, and when necessary, glucose was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The flasks were incubated at constant temperature (30°C) and the indicated light regimens. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the OD730 of the cultures was recorded daily for 10 consecutive days.2.9. Statistical analysis of cyanobacteria-specific growth2.10. RT-PCR and RT-qPCR for gfp transcription analysisFor total RNA extraction, 400 ml of BG11 medium was inoculated to an OD730 ˜ 0.2 with pre-cultures of Synechocystis wild type and mutants harboring the gfp gene (SNnK.gfp and SNnK.Cgfp mutants' series). Three independent biological replicates of each strain were grown to an OD730 ˜ 1, at 28°C in glass gas washing bottles with aeration, under continuous light. Cells from 100 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 3,850 g); pellets were treated with RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted as described previously27 and stored at -80°C until further analysis. RNA quality and contamination verifications, cDNA synthesis, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR experiments were performed as described27 using primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. The genes 16S, petB and rnpB were amplified using the primers described elsewhere27 and used as reference genes for data normalization. All RT-qPCR parameters in these experiments were in agreement with the MIQE (minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments) guidelines.28 RT-qPCR data from three biological replicates and three technical replicates were analysed using qbase+ v2.6 (Biogazelle), and the statistical analysis was performed by means of a one-way ANOVA, using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad software Inc.).2.11. Western blotFor the western blot, 20 ml of the same cultures used for gfp transcription analyses (by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR) was collected by centrifugation (10 min at 3,850 g) and stored at -80°C until further use. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT) supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (cOmplete Mini, EDTA free, Roche) and disrupted by sonication on ice with a Branson Sonifier 250 using 5 cycles of 15 s (50% dutty cycle, Output 3) intercalated with 1 min off duty. Cell debris was separated by two rounds of 10 min centrifugation at 10,000 g and 4°C. Protein extracts were stored at -20°C until further analysis. Protein quantification was performed using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), and 15 µg of each extract was separated by electrophoresis on 12% (wt/vol) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein extracts were visualized with colloidal Coomassie blue staining (Sigma) or transferred to a Hybond™-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). After the transfer, membranes were blocked for 3 h with 5% (wt/vol) milk powder in TTBS [Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20] and then incubated overnight at 4°C with GFP-specific monoclonal mouse antibody (Roche) in fresh blocking buffer. After washing with TTBS, blots were incubated for 1 h with goat-anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) linked to horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were washed with TTBS before immunodetection, which was performed by chemiluminescence using ECL Western Blotting Analysis System detection reagents.2.12. Confocal microscopyTen millilitres of BG11 medium was inoculated with Synechocystis wild type or mutants harbouring the gfp gene (SNnK.gfp and SNnK.Cgfp mutants' series) to OD730 ˜ 0.15. The cultures were grown to OD730 ˜ 1.0, under continuous light at 30°C and subsequently diluted to a final OD730 ˜ 0.1 in fresh BG11. Ten millilitres of each diluted culture was incubated under the same light and temperature conditions as above and grown until OD730 ˜ 1.0. Two hundred microlitres of each culture was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 µl of fresh BG11 and 40 µl of 1% (wt/vol) low-melting point agarose dissolved in BG11 medium was added. Ten microlitres of each mixture was immediately loaded on a glass slide and covered with a coverslip. The GFP emission (collected between 500 and 540 nm) was observed when the cells were exposed to a laser beam at 488 nm, using a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Cyanobacterial autofluorescence was collected between 640 and 680 nm after excitation at 633 nm. Images were analysed with the LAS AF Lite v3.3 software (Leica Microsystems). GFP fluorescence measurements were also performed for these samples as described below.2.13. GFP fluorescence measurementsFifty millilitres of BG11 medium was inoculated with Synechocystis wild type or mutants harbouring the gfp gene (SNnK.gfp and SNnK.Cgfp mutants' series) to OD730 ˜ 0.1. The cultures were grown to OD730 ˜ 2.5, under continuous light at 30°C, and subsequently diluted to a final OD730 ˜ 0.2 in fresh BG11. Ten millilitres of each diluted culture was transferred to three sterile 25-ml borosilicate glass flasks and closed with cellulose stoppers. The flasks were incubated under the same light and temperature conditions, and samples for total fluorescence measurements were collected after 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11 days after inoculation. For fluorescence measurements, three aliquots of 200 µl of each biological replicate were distributed in a Nunc™ MicroWell™ 96-Well Optical-Bottom Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), and GFP fluorescence and OD790 were detected using the Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader and the Gen5™ software (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). For fluorescence detection, an excitation filter of 485/20 nm and an emission filter of 528/20 nm were used (sensibility set for 110 nm). OD790 was measured using an absorbance filter of 790 nm. Wells with BG11 were included for background fluorescence measurement, and plate readings were carried out in duplicate. Absolute fluorescence values were normalized to the background values of the BG11 medium, and the wild type was used as fluorescence baseline. Mean GFP fluorescence per cell was normalized to the OD790 and is expressed in arbitrary units (A.U.).2.14. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantificationFor the proteomics analysis, 50 ml cultures of Synechocystis wild type (WT), the mutants constitutively expressing gfp (SN5K.Cgfp, SN8K.Cgfp, SN10K.Cgfp, SN15K.Cgfp and SN16K.Cgfp) and a mutant carrying a promoterless gfp gene at site N15 (SN15K.gfp) were grown in quadruplicate at 30°C under continuous light, until they reached an OD730 ˜ 0.7. The culture volumes used for sample collection were normalized to the culture with lowest OD730, to guarantee biomass uniformity among samples. The cultures were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3,850 g, and cell pellets were preserved at -80°C prior to protein extraction. The four replicates of each strain were paired and combined together, resulting in 14 samples for analysis (Supplementary Table S5). The samples were run across two isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantifications (iTRAQs) 8-plex with the pooled WT samples being a common control in both experiments creating a point of reference between them.For protein extraction, cells were washed with 150 mM sodium chloride and spun down for 10 min at 4,000 g, and the supernatant was discarded. Pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of lysis buffer [200 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), plant protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1% (vol/vol) nonidet P40 from Sigma] and transferred to a 2 ml LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) containing ~200 mg of 200 µm Zirconium beads. Samples were then pulsed on a bead-beater for 10 cycles of 60 s with a 2-min cooling step on ice between cycles. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and supernatants were transferred to new microfuge tubes. Pellets were further resuspended in 200 µl of lysis buffer, pulsed for a further 5 cycles on the bead-beater and centrifuged as before, and supernatants were combined to the previous ones. The combined supernatants were further clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to ensure that any remaining cell debris was removed from the extracts. The clarified extracts (~400 µl) were incubated with 2 µl of benzonase nuclease (Novagene) for 2 min on ice. Protein content in each extract was precipitated with the addition of four volumes of cold acetone and was incubated overnight at -20°C. The precipitated proteins were then spun down, and the supernatants were discarded. The protein pellets were then resuspended in 200 mM TEAB, and protein concentration was estimated using the modified Lowry spectrophotometric method as described.29 The concentration of the protein extracts and the efficiency of the lysis method were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel.From each sample, 100 µg of the protein extract was collected for enzymatic digestion, and the final volume was adjusted to 30 µl with 200 mM TEAB, pH 8.5. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM TCEP [tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine] for 1 h at 60°C. Cysteines were blocked using 20 mM methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) for 10 min at room temperature. The reduced and blocked proteins were digested overnight at 37°C, using trypsin 1:25 (wt/wt) (Promega) in 200 mM TEAB, pH 8.5. iTRAQ, 8-plex reagents (ABSciex) were resuspended in 100 µl isopropanol and added to the appropriate digested proteins. The peptides and labels were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation, unreacted iTRAQ reagents were quenched by adding 0.1% (vol/vol) hydroxylamine and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. All labeled peptide fractions were combined and split into two separate tubes. These peptide samples were dried using a vacuum concentrator and stored at -20°C prior to off-line fractionation using a HyperCarb porous graphitic column (particle size: 3 µm, length: 50 mm, diameter: 2.1 mm, pore size: 5 µm, Thermo Scientific) on a UHPLC Ultimate 3000 RS (Dionex). Dried peptides were resuspended in 100 µl of Buffer A [0.1% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 3% (vol/vol) HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) in HPLC-grade water] and were eluted using a linear gradient of Buffer B [0.1% (vol/vol) TFA, 97% (vol/vol) HPLC-grade ACN in HPLC-grade water] ranging from 10 to 60% over 2 h. Peptide elution was monitored using a wavelength of 214 nm and with Chromeleon software, version 6.50 (Dionex). Fractions were collected at 2-min intervals across the gradient and dried using a vacuum concentrator. The dried fractions were stored at -20°C prior to mass spectrometry analysis. The second (reverse-phase) dimension of the chromatographic separation was performed on an Ultimate 3000 capillary HPLC system (Dionex) on-line connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-ToF) QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (ABSciex). Each HyperCarb fraction was resuspended in loading buffer [0.1% (vol/vol) TFA, 3% (vol/vol) HPLC-grade ACN in HPLC-grade water], and two injections were carried out. Chromatographic separation was performed on a 75 µm × 15 cm C18 analytical column (particle size: 3 µm, pore size: 100 Å, LC Packings, CA, USA) preceded by a C18 trap column (Dionex/LC Packings). A 90-min gradient elution was performed using Buffer A [0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid (FA) and 3% (vol/vol) HPLC-grade ACN in HPLC-grade water] and Buffer B [0.1% (vol/vol) FA and 97% (vol/vol) HPLC-grade ACN in HPLC-grade water], during which Buffer B increased from 3 to 35% at a flow rate of 300 nl min-1. In the mass spectrometer, MS survey scans were acquired at 1 Hz with a m/z (mass-to-charge) range of 350-1,600, and two dynamically selected ions with a +2 or +3 charge state were isolated and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID). The collision energy was optimized to maximize the intensities of the reporter ions without losing sequence information. Each MS/MS (tandem mass spectrum) was accumulated for 3 s. Data were acquired and processed using Analyst QS version 2.0 (ABSciex). Protein identification and quantification were carried out using Phenyx Software version 2.6 (Genebio). MS/MS spectra were searched against the UniProt flat-text database (accessed April 2015), containing 3,576 protein sequences of Synechocystis, with the protein sequences of GFP and NPTII added to it. Mass tolerance was set to 0.3 Da and MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.1 Da. The peptide modifications were the same for each search (fixed modifications: methylthio for cysteines, iTRAQ 8-plex for lysine and peptide N-terminus and variable modifications: oxidation of methionine). The false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated by simultaneously using the true and the reverse databases generated with Phenyx,30 as previously described.31 An FDR of 1% with at least two unique peptides was imposed on the data, and peptide spectral matches (PSMs) falling above this value were excluded. The peptide lists generated by Phenyx were analysed as described elsewhere.32 Each iTRAQ was analysed separately to this point and then merged to generate background proteomic effects across the samples. The peptide quantifications were merged as follows: the lists were checked to find a list of all proteins successfully identified with at least two unique peptides and at least three PSMs in both iTRAQs. The iTRAQ quantification values of these proteins were normalized separately using median correction, to account for internal label variation, before a fixed ‘a’ value (0.5 with this data) was added to all quantifications, to remove the effects of missing labels and noise in the data on the ratio-driven quantification used with iTRAQ. The quantifications were ratio-transformed relative to the mean of the WT controls in each sample and then scaled to each other so that the mean of the WT controls in each sample was equal. A cluster analysis in the form of both a dendrogram (Ward linkage) and principal components analysis (PCA) was then performed to look for background differences between the samples. Significant differences were identified using our in-house protein pipeline, which utilizes a series of paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction, as described elsewhere.33 The free online tool KEGG color-mapper (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html, accessed: 27 April 2015) was used to highlight metabolic pathways that were systematically significantly up- or down-regulated.3. Results3.1. Selection of putative neutral sitesTo identify putative neutral sites in the chromosome of Synechocystis, the list of annotated open reading frames (ORFs) with the respective encoded proteins was retrieved from CyanoBase (http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase). From the 3,264 ORFs listed, 1,532 of the putatively encoded proteins were annotated as being unknown or hypothetical, and a subsequent bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify those matching the following criteria: (i) length of the putatively encoded proteins =301 amino acids, (ii) encoded proteins with no predicted transmembrane domains, (iii) no reported interaction with other proteins and (iv) no relevant similarities found at the protein sequence level. This analysis led to the selection of 16 candidate neutral sites—termed N1–N16 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3). Afterwards, a qualitative analysis of the genomic context of these ORFs was performed (Fig. 1B) and revealed that the N2 site superimposes the 5' region of an ORF (slr0369) putatively encoding a cation or drug efflux system protein, the N4 site overlaps the 5' region of an ORF (slr0415) putatively encoding a Na+/H+ antiporter and the N9 site corresponds to the ORF located immediately upstream and in the same direction as an ORF (sll0182) putatively encoding an ABC-type transporter. Therefore, these three sites were disregarded, and transcription analyses were performed for the other 13 loci.3.2. Transcription analysis and final selectionTo assess whether there was no transcription or whether the transcript levels of the identified loci were negligible, RT-PCRs were initially performed using RNA extracted from Synechocystis cells collected at the exponential growth phase (OD730 ˜ 0.8). The results revealed high transcript levels for N3, N11, N12 and N13 sites, low transcript levels for N6, N8, N14 and N15 sites, low primer efficiency for N1 site and no detectable amplification for the remaining sites (N5, N7, N10 and N16). Regarding N1 site, the transcription analysis was unreliable, and the locus was too small to design other primers so this site disregarded (Supplementary Fig. S27). Further transcriptional studies were performed collecting cells at different phases (early exponential, exponential and stationary), to evaluate a possible differential transcription of sites N5, N6, N7, N8, N10, N14, N15 and N16 (Fig. 2). The results showed that there was residual transcription for N6 and N14 sites throughout the various growth phases, and therefore, these two sites were disregarded. Concerning the other sites, it was possible to detect residual transcription for N8 and N15 sites, but only at one point of the growth curve—samples collected at the early exponential. Thus, six sites (N5, N7, N8, N10, N15 and N16) were selected to generate mutants to validate their ‘neutrality’. Subsequent cloning difficulties in constructing N7-related plasmids, probably due to secondary structures formation, resulted in this site also being disregarded. The final five target sites (N5, N8, N10, N15 and N16) are evenly distributed throughout the chromosome, with intervals in the order of 60-90° (72° corresponds to 1/5 of the chromosome, see Fig. 1A).3.3. Generation of mutantsThe integrative plasmids used to transform Synechocystis and characterize the neutral sites (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6) were constructed as described in Material and Methods (for details, see Supplementary Fig. S1). Synechocystis mutants were obtained by natural transformation with the respective plasmid (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S7), and full segregation was confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S28) and Southern blot (Supplementary Fig. S29). All the mutants produced in this study are fully segregated, with all chromosomal copies mutated and the insertion of ectopic genes was also confirmed (resistance cassettes and gfp modules). The mutants produced using the pSNnKS plasmid series (SNnKS mutants, containing the double selection cassette) exhibited the expected phenotypes of kanamycin resistance (KmR) and sucrose sensitivity (SucS) (Supplementary Fig. S30). List of organisms and plasmids used/generated in this workan = 5, 8, 10, 15, 16.List of organisms and plasmids used/generated in this workan = 5, 8, 10, 15, 16.3.4. Statistical analysis of cyanobacteria-specific growthTo assess the neutrality of the sites, Synechocystis mutants were produced exchanging each putative neutral site by a kanamycin resistance cassette, using the pSNnK plasmid series (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). The successful generation of fully segregated mutants in the five sites showed that the mutations did not affect cell viability under standard growth conditions. The growth of the wild type and the five mutants was evaluated in standard growth conditions for Synechocystis: continuous light (20 µmol photons m-2 s-1; CL) or 12 h light (20 µmol photons m-2 s-1)/12 h dark cycles (LD), in autotrophy (no glucose; G0) or mixotrophy (5 mM glucose; G5), and at a constant temperature of 30°C. The OD of the cultures (OD730) was monitored daily for 10 consecutive days, and the resulting growth curves for each organism and cultivation conditions were obtained (Fig. 3). To assess the effect of the mutations on growth, a statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the growth data was used to compare the wild type and the mutants, using the specific growth rate—µ (see Material and Methods for details). The use of this parameter was considered reliable, since the test duration was the same in all conditions, and growth patterns were similar within the different mutants and replicas. The results of the three-way ANOVA analysis performed on the growth results, including P-values of up to second-order interactions can be found in Supplementary Table S4. Third-order interactions were in accordance to these results. Comparing the effect on growth of each mutation to the wild type, mutants SN5K and SN8K showed highly significant P-values, while for SN10K the P-value is ~0.01, and for SN15K and SN16K, the P-values are not statistically significant (Supplementary Table S4). In detail, mutant SN5K grows slower than the wild type (particularly in the presence of glucose), while mutant SN8K grows faster under continuous light (with or without glucose). Taking these results into consideration, the chromosomal loci neutrality may be qualitatively ordered as WT ˜ N15 ˜ N16 > N10 > N8 >> N5, in terms of growth. For the remaining variables considered in the ANOVA, irradiance and glucose were the major parameters affecting growth (with highly significant P-values). Growth curves of Synechocystis wild type and mutants in the five neutral sites (SN5K, SN8K, SN10K, SN15K, SN16K) cultivated under different conditions. Ten millilitres of culture was grown in 25-ml flasks at 30°C, and OD730 values were recorded daily for 10 consecutive days in continuous light (CL) or 12 h light (20µmolphotons/m2/s)/12 h dark cycles (LD), in autotrophy (G0) or mixotrophy (5 mM glucose, G5). These results are representative of three biological replicates and technical duplicates, and the differences among them are not significant; error bars show ±S.D.Growth curves of Synechocystis wild type and mutants in the five neutral sites (SN5K, SN8K, SN10K, SN15K, SN16K) cultivated under different conditions.

These results are representative of three biological replicates and technical duplicates, and the differences among them are not significant; error bars show ±S.D.3.5. Synthetic interface robustness and neutral sites functionalityTo use the constructed vectors as tools for the integration of synthetic modules, a BioBrick-compatible cloning interface was designed and synthesized. A DNA sequence containing the MunI, NotI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI restriction sites, compatible with the RFC[10] assembly standard, was flanked by two double transcription terminators (BioBricks BBa_B1006 and BBa_B0062 upstream, and BBa_B0053 and BBa_B0020 downstream), to prevent any potential promoter activity from backbone DNA sequences. The interface was synthesized and cloned between the two homologous recombination sequences of each vector. To evaluate the proper transcriptional insulation of the interface, a promoterless green fluorescent protein generator (GFP; BioBrick composite part BBa_E0240) was cloned in the pSNnK plasmid series, and Synechocystis mutants were produced (mutants SNnK.gfp, Table 1 and Supplementary Table S7). Additionally, to assess the functionality of the neutral sites, Synechocystis mutants carrying the GFP generator under the control of a constitutive synthetic promoter (minimal psbA2 promoter, PpsbA2*) were constructed (mutants SNnK.Cgfp, Table 1 and Supplementary Table S7). gfp transcription was assessed by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S31A), and GFP expression was analysed by western blot (Supplementary Fig. S31B), confocal microscopy (Fig. 4A) and fluorimetry (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S32). In all cases, gfp transcripts and GFP levels could only be detected in mutants where the promoter PpsbA2* is present (SNnK.Cgfp); in these mutants, GFP fluorescence is relatively constant over time (11 days). Moreover, to determine whether the same PpsbA2* promoter-gfp construction is equivalent in terms of transcription strength at the different sites (chromosomal three-dimensional structure can affect promoter strength), RT-qPCR was performed using RNA extracted from the SNnK.Cgfp mutants (wild type was used as negative control). All RT-qPCR parameters in these experiments were in agreement with the MIQE guidelines.28 The normalized fold expression of gfp in the mutants was calculated, and there are no statistically significant differences between the five sites, as calculated by one-way ANOVA (Supplementary Fig. S33).

Proteomes of the wild type versus neutral site mutantsTo evaluate changes on the proteome of Synechocystis, associated with the deletion of each neutral site/expression of synthetic modules, an iTRAQ analysis was performed. Across the two iTRAQ experiments performed (see Material and Methods for details), 536 of the identified proteins with two or more unique peptides at an FDR of 1% were common to both studies (Supplementary Tables S8–S10). During data analysis, the relative quantifications of the two iTRAQ experiments were scaled, so that the mean of the control samples (wild type) in both iTRAQs was equal. The hierarchical clustering of the iTRAQ labels following combination clearly shows a clustering of the wild-type technical (a and b) and biological (1 and 2) replicates (Supplementary Fig. S34). Close to the wild type, there is a replicate of the mutant containing the promoterless gfp module (SN15K.gfp), while all the mutants constitutively expressing GFP constitute a single cluster (with the biological replicates clustering closely), with the exception of two samples (bSN5K.Cgfp2 and bSN10K.Cgfp2) that do not cluster with any of the others (Supplementary Fig. S34). During data analysis, it became apparent that for these two samples, there was a significantly higher concentration of membrane proteins compared with the other biological replicates from the same set. This was likely due to technical variability during protein extraction and as a result, both the bSN5K.Cgfp2 and bSN10K.Cgfp2 outliers were removed from further analysis. A PCA plot showing the first two components (87.79%, 8.77%) of protein variation (Fig. 5), highlighted that as expected both the heterologous proteins GFP and NPTII (NPTII: aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, conferring resistance to neomycin/kanamycin) clustered away from the rest of the proteome. Only one native protein, P74485, clustered away with the NPTII protein. Overall, in all cases the proteome was found to be unchanged in any systematic way compared with the wild type, although a reduction of high-abundance phycobiliproteins in the mutants expressing GFP was observed (the effect was not seen in the promoterless gfp module mutant). This reduction was possibly an artefact of the relative quantification methods utilized in the iTRAQ workflow and would require absolute protein quantification against total protein weight per cell to verify.

DiscussionSynechocystis is a well-studied cyanobacterium with molecular tools developed for its genetic manipulation. Replicative plasmids have been used to introduce foreign DNA into this organism via conjugation or electroporation.34,35 These plasmids are usually based on the broad-host-range E. coli IncQ plasmid RSF1010 and are not specific for cyanobacteria.9,10 Although presenting some advantages, such as being relatively easy to construct and quick to introduce in the cell, broad-host-range replicative plasmids can exhibit some instability.36,37 In addition, (i) the use of large native DNA fragments may lead to the recombination of the replicative vectors with the chromosome, (ii) removal of selective pressure may lead to loss of the vector and (iii) DNA structure of the vectors may have a strong influence on transcription. Altogether these aspects may compromise the system reliability and behaviour. In addition, it has been shown that Synechocystis' endogenous plasmids copy number per chromosome vary with nutritional conditions and growth phase.38 Taking into consideration that the number of chromosomes also varies throughout growth,39 plasmids copy number calculations may become even more complex. Therefore, stable integration of ectopic DNA into Synechocystis' chromosome is a viable alternative for the implementation of synthetic modules into this photoautotrophic chassis. For this purpose, the availability of fully characterized chromosomal neutral sites is crucial.To date, only a few chromosomal loci have been used to introduce foreign DNA into Synechocystis, but they have not been extensively characterized. One of these loci disrupts the gene slr016811 that encodes a protein that was shown to be secreted.40 Although its function is unknown, Slr0168 possesses a DUF4114 protein domain, found towards the C-terminal of various bacterial proteins and suggested to carry enzymatic activity.41 An additional locus was described as a ‘nonessential, nontranscribed’12 region; however, RNA-seq works42,43 showed that the genes flanking that insertion locus are transcribed. Another locus described disrupts the ssl0410 gene,14 which is located downstream the gene encoding a subunit of the type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (ndhB) that is important for CO2 uptake in Synechocystis.44 The intergenic region between slr2030 and slr2031,13 which encodes the regulatory protein RsbU, has also been used for chromosomal integrations. Nonetheless, slr2031 is constitutively transcribed, and the respective mutant showed a defect in growth recovery after nitrogen- and sulfur-starvation-induced stationary phase.45 Furthermore, slr2030 and slr2031 are transcribed as an operon.42,43,45 Consequently, insertions in that intergenic region may disrupt the transcriptional unit and lead to the same phenotype described for slr2031 mutants. More recently, three other neutral sites have been identified,15 based on a RNA-sequencing study,42 and characterized under continuous light, at 30°C. In that study, it was shown that the insertion of a reporter gene in the different sites resulted, however, in different fluorescence intensity. Since the integration sites described previously do not match at least one of the selection criteria established in this study, they were not considered here.Within this work, several putative neutral sites were identified following an unbiased systematic approach and further characterized for the stable integration of synthetic circuits into Synechocystis' chromosome. Although non-coding DNA (ncDNA) regions could be used for this purpose, they may possess cis-regulatory control sequences, thus affecting the transcription profiles of several genes.46,47 Therefore, in this work, only ORFs putatively encoding unknown or hypothetical proteins were considered. After an initial genomic context analysis of the selected ORFs, RT-PCR transcription studies were performed at different phases of Synechocystis growth curve, and the transcription levels appeared to be negligible for the five sites characterized in this work. These results are partially supported by RNA-sequencing studies,42,43 reporting that the number of direct readings for sites N5, N8 and N16 was close to the cut-off threshold under the tested conditions, while for sites N10 and N15, transcripts were detected mainly in the exponential phase (transcriptional unit TU698),43 or induced by dark (transcriptional unit TU1565),42,43 respectively. This technique allows the high-throughput identification of transcriptional units and may be useful for the identification of additional neutral sites, namely genomic regions that are not transcribed under all the conditions tested. In all cases, complementary validation methods should be used (e.g. RT-qPCR)48 and cell viability and fitness assessed. The successful generation of fully segregated mutants, with each selected neutral site replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette, showed that they do not encode proteins essential to the viability of the cyanobacterium under the tested growth conditions. Several studies reported that genes crucial to the viability of Synechocystis cannot be successfully and completely inactivated, resulting in heteroploid mutant cells, containing both chromosomes harbouring the wild-type gene and the knockout locus.49,50 Moreover, the neutrality of each site was assessed by analysing the growth of mutants SN5K, SN8K, SN10K, SN15K and SN16K cultivated under different conditions. The results showed that the N15 and N16 sites mutants exhibit growth patterns similar to those of the wild type, while the N5, N8 and N10 site mutants present statistically significant differences. The N5 mutant clearly exhibits a growth decrease, in particular when grown under light/dark cycles in the presence of glucose. Therefore, this should be taken into account when choosing this site for the integration of ectopic DNA. Interestingly, the mutant on site N8 exhibited growth rates slightly higher than the parental strain under continuous light, a feature that may be advantageous for biotechnological applications. As for the remaining variables considered in the ANOVA, and similarly to the results obtained by Lopo and co-workers,51 irradiance and the presence of glucose were the major parameters affecting growth (highly significant P-values).All the integrative plasmids constructed in this work possess a BioBrick-compatible synthetic interface for cloning purposes. The robustness of this synthetic interface was assessed using the promoterless GFP generator (BioBrick BBa_E0240), which showed no leakiness from the chromosomal backbone for each site, since no/negligible levels of gfp transcripts were detected by RT-PCR, and no GFP expression was observed by western blot, confocal microscopy or whole cell fluorescence measurements. In contrast, using the same techniques, gfp transcripts and GFP signal could be detected in all the mutants generated bearing the GFP generator under the control of a constitutive synthetic promoter (based on the photosensitive promoter of the psbA2 gene of Synechocystis). This shows that these five sites can effectively be used for the functional integration of synthetic modules. Moreover, the relative quantification of transcripts by RT-qPCR showed that gfp transcription is not affected by the position of the neutral site in the chromosome, and consequently, the five sites may be considered equivalent in this respect.The PCA derived from the iTRAQ experiment showed that the overall proteomes of the neutral site mutants do not change in any systematic way (with the exception of a reduction in the high-abundance phycobiliproteins) compared with the wild type. In addition, the heterologous proteins GFP and NPTII clustered away from the rest of the proteome, an expected result since these proteins are absent in the wild type. Only one native protein, P74485, clustered away from the bulk proteome. This small protein is largely uncharacterized, but has been reported as being related to stress conditions.52,53Altogether, these results show that the selected chromosomal sites are functional and suitable to receive ectopic DNA. In addition, the vectors constructed in this work followed a rational design that allows the stable integration of synthetic modules into Synechocystis foreseeing, e.g. the production of specialty chemicals. Moreover, the possibility to generate markerless mutants by transforming the SNnKS mutants with the pSNn plamids containing a module of interest enables the use of these vectors to sequentially introduce more than one synthetic module into the chromosome. The existence of more than one integration site, spread throughout the chromosome of Synechocystis, allows the implementation of complex synthetic circuits. The vectors design also considered the possibility to use different resistance cassettes making the implementation faster. This work contributes to the field of synthetic biology by allowing the use of Synechocystis as a photoautotrophic chassis, providing not only standard BioBrick-compatible vectors to integrate synthetic modules into fully characterized chromosomal neutral sites, but also chassis prone to receive a synthetic module without selective markers. Furthermore, our work constitutes a proof of concept for mapping and validating genomic neutral sites that can be applied to other biological systems.FundingThis work was supported by the European Commission through the Seventh Framework Programme, FP7-ENERGY-2012-1-2STAGE-308518 (CyanoFactory), from EU FP6-NEST-2005-Path-SYN project BioModularH2 (contract no. 043340) and from National Funds through Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) (grants SFRH/BD/36378/2007 to F.P., SFRH/BPD/64095/2009 to C.C.P., SFRH/BPD/74894/2010 to P.O.).

IntroductionThe development of new methods for identifying protein-coding genes and pseudogenes in genome sequences is one of the major challenges in the genomic age. In addition to the extraordinary support given by experimental approaches, computational analysis is an essential task for protein-coding gene identification in present genome biology.1,2 Current gene prediction algorithms perform a number of limited but standard steps, including identification of open reading frames (ORFs) and predicted sequence analysis to assign putative functions by similarity to known proteins, motifs, and/or structures in databases.3–9 However, even though gene prediction and annotation software are increasingly efficient, small protein-coding genes and complex intron-containing genes may still escape detection by standard in silico analysis.Recent experimental data from ‘omic-technologies’ generated in model organisms are creating the possibility to accurately update published genome annotations.10 The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one of these model organisms.11 The 12.5 Mb S. pombe genome was among the first genomes that were entirely sequenced. Based on standard computational prediction, together with experimental data, 4,824 genes and 31 pseudogenes were initially annotated.12 However, while >95% of the genome is transcribed,13–15 only 55% of the genome corresponds to annotated coding sequences,12,16 raising the possibility that more protein-coding genes await to be discovered. Accordingly, high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches14,17–19 increased this initial number to the 5,123 protein-coding genes that are currently annotated in PomBase (http://www.pombase.org), the S. pombe database.20 Some pseudogenes were also reassigned as genes, leaving 29 pseudogenes annotated at present. More recently, the use of ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) to investigate the translational landscape of meiosis added further 46 new protein-coding genes to the fission yeast genome.18 Most of these new findings correspond to genes coding for small polypeptides and/or coding sequences lacking significant alignments in databases, highlighting that the in silico identification of this set of coding sequences is still challenging in genome annotation.The identification of similar proteins through BLAST analysis is one of the most useful strategies in annotation tasks. Finding significant alignments facilitates assignment of putative functions to query amino acid sequences through the identification of related proteins in databases. Interestingly, non-significant alignments (below the significant threshold) are often found in conventional BLAST searches. In polypeptides derived from the electronic translation of non-coding DNA, such alignments occur by chance. In polypeptides from coding DNA, however, in addition to random matches, non-significant alignments may also underlie small amino acid patterns representing random footprints of common ancestors.21,22 Since protein-coding genes mostly arise from previous ones during evolution, even highly divergent coding sequences may harbour ancient footprints of common ancestral proteins to be found among the millions of proteins available in databases. These footprints are not present in non-coding DNA sequences.22 Thus, alignments accumulated in predicted amino acid sequences might provide a method to discern coding from non-coding DNA, a new strategy that may overcome limitations of current in silico algorithms.To use this strategy for the identification of coding regions at genome level, we developed a computer program, named AnABlast, which generates profiles of accumulated alignments in query amino acid sequences using a low-stringency BLAST strategy. To test its potential use as a gene-finder algorithm, a genome-wide search of coding sequences was carried out in fission yeast, and Ribo-Seq data used to validate protein-coding regions were highlighted by AnABlast profiles.18 Overall, several new genes and ancient coding sequences were efficiently identified by using AnABlast in the extremely well annotated S. pombe genome. The strategy was also successfully applied in a genomic region of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that this novel tool may be applicable to the in silico analysis of any other sequenced genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Search strategyWe have designed a computational workflow, here named AnABlast (Ancestral-patterns search through A BLAST-based strategy), to search for putative coding sequences in genomic regions. Briefly, to search for new coding regions in a genome, all inter-exon DNA sequences of the genome (intergenic and intronic regions) were translated in all six frames, masking stop codons with ‘X’ characters; in this way, the analysis become independent of traditional ORF signals. The algorithm then executes a BLASTP search with the six resultant amino acid sequences (as BLASTX, although it can be parallelized into six threads to accelerate the process) and the UniRef50 database (2014_02 version). The UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) provide clustered sets of sequences from virtually all the published protein sequences,23 being the clusters from UniRef50 built with amino acid sequences having at least 50% sequence identity. AnABlast only uses the representative member from each UniRef50 cluster, and thus, it only considers non-similar sequences at 50% identity threshold (avoiding biases coming from sequence redundancy).BLAST analysis efficiently identifies homologous sequences through highly significant alignments.3 However, because a high frequency of low significant alignments may reveal stretches of ancestral regions,21,22 we used a low-stringency BLAST strategy to include alignments beyond a significant similarity, a key step in our strategy to identify putative coding sequences with a biological and/or evolutionary significance (Fig. 1). To this end, AnABlast uses non-restrictive parameters including a low bit score threshold for considering hits. Bit score represents a normalized value that allows comparison of results from different assays. Because bit score thresholds are not allowed in BLAST tools, low bit score values (from 25) were established by using high E-values (up to 2,00,000). Using the appropriate scoring matrix during the BLAST search (among available BLOSUM and PAM standard matrices) can improve AnABlast sensitivity. In this study, the BLOSUM90 matrix was selected to favour the search of high identity sequences in very short alignments, enough to be considered protomotifs21 or ancient footprints of protein sequences.22 The low-complexity filter SEG is also used to avoid sequence repeats, thereby improving specificity. Sequence alignments were trained with coding sequences from the analysed genome (data not shown), and a bit score threshold (given by the score matrix and the search space size) that better highlighted coding regions was used. In the S. pombe genome, a threshold of 30 in the score alignment was optimal in our search strategy, corresponding to an E-value of ~12,000 (the default E-value for searching significant hits is usually 10). Finally, up to a maximum of 10,000 alignments by query is allowed. Schematic representation of the AnABlast strategy for the identification of coding sequences. (A) In conserved proteins, conventional BLAST analysis of query sequences usually generates a number of significant alignments that allow the identification of coding sequences. The accumulation of these alignments along the query sequence (AnABlast profile) generates prominent peaks that also allow the easy identification of conserved coding regions. (B) In non-conserved sequences, BLAST search generates non-significant alignments, but AnABlast profiles highlight coding regions by the significant accumulation of these alignments, generated by random matches as well as from random footprints of common ancestors. (C) Non-coding sequences lack common ancestors in protein databases, and non-significant alignments may only occur by chance. In this case, alignments rarely accumulate in particular regions.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.In a second step, AnABlast takes the positions from the acquired hits and counts the number of alignments (belonging to different clusters) that matches each position. As a result of this analysis, AnABlast yields a profile where discrete peaks highlight specific regions in the genome. Independently of the level of significance of each particular alignment, the high number of sequence alignments accumulated at a specific strand and reading frame reveals a significant region in terms of biological function and/or evolution.21,22 Under the above parameters, randomized and non-coding sequences yielded AnABlast profiles with peaks rarely reaching a maximum of 70 accumulated sequences. In this study, a cut-off threshold of 70 accumulated sequences was applied to optimize the identification of putative present and fossil-coding regions. The AnABlast algorithm is summarized in Fig. 2 and can be tested by downloading its different modules from http://www.bioinfocabd.upo.es/ab. AnABlast algorithm (schematized flux diagram) for coding sequence identification in a genome-wide search strategy. Amino acid sequences obtained from the six reading frames (RF) of each DNA inter-exon region are subjected to BLAST search against a protein database that minimizes redundancies (uniref50). After low-stringency alignment parameters (optimal bit score threshold: 30), hits are taken at each position of the query amino acid sequence, generating a profile of accumulated alignments along the sequence (AnABlast profile). Significant peaks in the generated profiles (higher than 70 in our S. pombe genome analysis) were selected, and the corresponding amino acid sequence further analysed by conventional BLAST and Pfam search.

Analysis of the selected sequencesFor all analysis, S. pombe annotations, protein and DNA sequences, and RNA expression data available from PomBase (http://www.pombase.org/) and C. elegans (https://www.wormbase.org/) on 1 February 2014 were used. The amino acid sequence delimited by each AnABlast peak was further studied manually by using BLAST3 and Pfam5 from their web applications (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and http://pfam.xfam.org/, respectively). To determine expression levels in AnABlast domains, genome-wide transcriptome Ribo-Seq data from proliferating and sporulating cells.18 Ribo-Seq and AnABlast data were visualized with the Integrated Genome Viewer.24 Genome-wide RNA-Seq data from cells subjected to temperature or nutritional stress14,19 were also used (available at http://www.pombase.org/).3. Results and discussion3.1. Setting up optimal AnABlast parametersThe significant accumulation of amino acid sequence alignments produced by AnABlast analysis may be useful to identify DNA-coding sequences of biological and/or evolutionary significance (Figs 1 and 2). To establish optimal AnABlast parameters for the accurate identification of coding sequences, we first analysed a genomic DNA region encoding known proteins. The S. pombe genome interval containing the universal protein kinase Cdc2 (encoded in the forward strand) and its flanking genes SPBC11B10.08 (forward strand), and pht1 (reverse strand) was used to this purpose. All six-frame translations of this DNA interval were obtained. To allow the complete analysis of the corresponding amino acid sequence independently of existing ORFs, stop codons were ignored (masked with ‘X’). As expected, AnABlast analysis produced a profile of discrete peaks that matched regions of annotated exons and RNA expression patterns (Fig. 3). Setting optimal thresholds in AnABlast parameters (bit score threshold in sequence alignments and cut-off threshold of accumulated sequences) is nonetheless a key question. The use of very low-stringency parameters to generate BLAST alignments (score = 28) would favour the identification of highly divergent coding sequences in our AnABlast strategy. However, the background noise caused by random matches at this permissive condition makes it difficult to discard false positives obtained by chance in non-coding sequences (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, setting of high alignment cut-off thresholds (score = 40) resulted in the efficient highlighting of only those coding regions with a significant similarity to sequences in databases, a pool of genes that are easily identified by conventional methods. By using a threshold of 30 in the score alignment, AnABlast peaks (accumulated sequences) generated in non-coding regions rarely reached the value of 70, while coding regions accumulated hundreds of sequences, yielding easily identifiable peaks (Fig. 3). Thus, a score alignment threshold of 30 in the BLAST search and a cut-off threshold of 70 in alignments accumulation were used as standard parameters for the selection of significant peaks identifying putative coding sequences. AnABlast profiles (accumulated alignments) in the Chr II: 1498400-1503600 genomic region containing the well-characterized cdc2 coding sequence and its flanking SPBC11B10.08 and pht1 genes (Pombase annotations).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Virtual translation of non-coding DNA generates random protein sequences. To better estimate false-positive rates under these parameters, we randomly shuffled the DNA sequence of the analysed genome interval. No significant peaks were found in 50 randomized sequences tested (see Fig. 3B), suggesting that significant peaks rarely occur by chance with the selected settings. Similarly, no significant peaks were observed when analysing the reverse 3'-5' sequence (Fig. 3C).Classic frameshift alignment analysis aids in the identification of frameshifts in DNA sequences.25 As AnABlast profiles identify coding sequences in the different reading frames, coding frameshifts can be also easily inferred from this computational analysis (see Cdc2 exons in Fig. 3A).3.2. AnABlast analysis of inter-exon regions in the entire S. pombe genomeTo perform a genome-wide search of new coding regions in fission yeast, we analysed all nucleotide sequences between every two adjacent annotated exons, accounting for a total of 5,870 intergenic regions and 4,782 introns. AnABlast profiles were generated for each of the six-frame translation sequences of these inter-exon regions. Among them, 158 regions contained at least one significant peak and were selected for further analysis. As a negative control, we randomized the corresponding DNA sequence in each of the analysed inter-exon regions. With this data set, only 19 significant peaks were obtained (AnABlast profiles obtained both in intergenic sequences, and its randomized versions are available at http://www.bioinfocabd.upo.es/anablast/supplementary_data.html). Thus, on average, >85% of the selected AnABlast peaks are expected to identify true-positive coding sequences.Interestingly, all the selected profiles, except one, were located in intergenic regions, suggesting that in general, S. pombe introns do not usually contain coding sequences. The only intronic peak was located in the first intron of the SPAC22F3.11c gene, snu23 (Fig. 4A). RNA-Seq profiles, the identification of zinc-finger motifs, and its high identity to Schizosaccharomyces sps genes (Supplementary Table S1A) indicate that the sequence identified by AnABlast in this annotated intron is in fact a coding sequence of the snu23 gene (Fig. 4A). A similar suggestion was made from S. pombe transcriptome analysis.19AnABlast profiles suggesting modifications in annotated intron and pseudogenes.

AnABlast peaks highlighting pseudogenesAnnotated transposons and pseudogenes were not excluded for intergenic regions analysis. Accordingly, a number of transposons and all 29 annotated pseudogenes were detected in AnABlast profiles (see examples in Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, AnABlast peaks uncovered a new pseudogene (Fig. 4B). Reading frames in this pseudogene contain numerous stop codons and at least five frameshifts, a complex structure that makes its identification by conventional methods difficult (see Fig. 4B). BLAST analysis of predicted amino acid sequences indicated that this new pseudogene encodes a putative dipeptide transmembrane transporter protein (Supplementary Table S1A). A second new pseudogene uncovered within rearranged DNA regions will be described later.Detailed analysis of AnABlast profiles generated in annotated pseudogenes suggested a number of corrections to their genomic annotations. Two additional coding domains (in different reading frames) flanking the SPBPB10D8.03 pseudogene suggest carboxyl- and amino-terminal expansions in the annotated region (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Table S1A). Another correction is suggested in the two annotated exons of the SPAPB24D3.05c pseudogene. AnABlast also identified two regions separated by a single frameshift, although region intervals and the reading frame for the first region differ from those in the annotated exons (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Table S1A). Aside corrections, AnABlast peaks matching Ribo-Seq data profiles in pseudogenes suggest that at least two of them could be reassigned as coding genes (Supplementary Fig. S2).From these results, we conclude that our in silico strategy efficiently highlights coding sequences in actual genes (Fig. 3) as well as in pseudogenes (Fig. 4). Since part of the pseudogenization process includes loss of initiating methionine, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, AnABlast might be useful to identify new genes, but also evolutionary degenerated coding sequences that escape to conventional searches.3.4. Identification of new genesThe S. pombe genome is extremely well annotated.16,20 Thus, a stringent test for AnABlast is the identification of new genes in the genome of this model organism. To this end, we initially looked for AnABlast peaks containing ORFs, and 18 of them were selected.Pfam and BLAST searches found that three of the selected ORFs uncovered new copies of annotated genes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly, four other ORF-containing AnABlast peaks identified putative new protein-coding genes, experimentally validated by Ribo-Seq expression patterns18 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S1B).

(Schematic BLAST results are included). Ribo-Seq data, Pombase annotations, and colour codes for reading frames of the analysed genomic intervals are shown. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The first novel gene partially overlaps the predicted poly(A)-bearing non-coding RNA SPNCRNA.31. Both the AnABlast ORF (42 amino acid length) and the annotated non-coding RNA are found in the forward strand, with the Ribo-Seq profile confirming the translation of the ORF (Fig. 5A).The second new gene contains a short 28 residues ORF that is highly expressed (Fig. 5B). The corresponding AnABlast peak further extends the carboxyl-terminal end of this ORF (see in Fig. 5B), suggesting that this extremely short gene could be originated through a carboxyl-terminal subtraction from a longer ancient one.26 Polypeptides encoded by these two new genes lack significant homologs or motifs in databases.The other two AnABlast ORFs, in addition to being translated, encode polypeptides that share significant similarity to known proteins. A main AnABlast peak, flanked by two others in different reading frames, identifies one of these new genes (see in Fig. 5C). Concatenated amino acid sequences from the three peaks render a 178-residue protein with a homologue in Schizosaccharomyces octosporus and eight in Schizosaccharomyces cryophilus, ranging in length from 102 to 190 residues (Supplementary Table S1B). RNA expression profile (see Ribo-Seq pattern in Fig. 5C) and its homology to the short EPY50361.1 S. cryophilus variant (see alignments in Fig. 5C) suggest that only the 56 residues ORF encoded by the first AnABlast peak is an active gene. Thus, the proposed S. pombe gene (and its equivalent in Schizosaccharomyces cryophilus) likely resulted from premature nonsense mutations, generating a fossil carboxyl-terminal sequence that in the remaining related proteins is still active.Another AnABlast ORF encodes a 77-residue polypeptide sharing 29% identity (52% similarity) along the entire sequence of the WP_002758301.1 protein from Microcystis aeruginosa, an evolutionary distant freshwater cyanobacteria (Fig. 5D). Identity increases to 35% with homolog proteins found in filamentous fungi, but homology length decreases to the first 52 residues in these closer microorganisms. Identity with homolog sequences found in S. cryophilus and S. octosporus rises to 76% but is limited to 31 amino-terminal residues. Since RNA expression is also observed at this 31 amino acids interval, we conclude that this short region is an active coding sequence in fission yeasts. According to BLAST alignments (Fig. 5D), premature nonsense mutations could also result in the progressive carboxyl-terminal subtractions of this coding sequence over evolution.26 However, in S. pombe, no stop codon is found at the 3' end position of the DNA sequence coding for the 31-residue domain (see in Supplementary Table S1). In fact, RNA-Seq data suggest the existence of at least two exons in this region (see Fig. 5D). Thus, in this particular case, subtraction likely raised in the S. pombe genome by the creation of a new splice site.27,28We cannot rule out the existence of new genes in the remaining ORFs found by AnABlast search. However, neither significant translation levels nor sequence/motif conservation support their actual gene status (see examples in Supplementary Fig. S4).The in silico identification of new genes is particularly useful for genome annotations. To test the potential use of AnABlast as a gene-finger tool in other organisms, we analysed the Chromosome II:0-5 Mb interval of the C. elegans genome. Annotated ORFs were efficiently highlighted in AnABlast profiles using the settings trained for the S. pombe genome. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of intergenic regions in this interval revealed that AnABlast profiles can also be useful to identify new genes in the nematode genome (Supplementary Fig. S5).3.5. Ancestral gene subtractionsAs shown above, our coding sequences search strategy can both find new genes and uncover their associated evolutionary history, revealing fossil-coding sequences that have being subtracted by changes in stop positions (Figs 5B and 3C) or in splice sites (Fig. 5D). To locate possible fossil coding sequences subtracted from present genes, we examined peaks located at the edge (exon boundaries) of AnABlast profiles at each inter-exon region. Peaks revealing amino acid sequences encoded in the same strand as adjacent exons were selected (putative ancient subtractions), and their corresponding amino acid sequences concatenated ignoring reading frameshifts and stop codons. Interestingly, BLAST searches identified two genes in which alignments to homologous proteins extended along the concatenated peptides, one by expanding the 5' end coding DNA sequence and the other through a 3' end extension (Fig. 6A and 4B, and Supplementary Table S1C).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.AnABlast peaks uncovering evolutionary carboxyl- and amino-terminal subtractions in present genes.

Ribo-Seq data, Pombase annotations, and colour codes for reading frames of the analysed genomic intervals are shown. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Evolutionary changes in coding sequence length seem to be dynamic processes via shifts in the position of the start29 and the stop codons.26 Our findings indicate that AnABlast may be useful to identify subtractions occurred during evolution. Remarkably, AnABlast can identify long terminal changes which, according to previous studies,26,29 represent rare events among terminal subtractions and expansions. Since evolutionary expansions are part of present genes, AnABlast analysis of intergenic regions carried out in this study cannot uncover these evolutionary events.3.6. Identification of gene fragmentsThe vast majority of the selected AnABlast profiles identified single peak regions without putative ORFs (63%, excluding pseudogenes and transposons). Since AnABlast identifies coding sequences independently of ORFs, most of these peaks could represent gene fragments arisen from mutations and/or genome rearrangements. Accordingly, careful BLAST and Pfam analysis of predicted amino acid sequences in some of these peaks revealed fragments of tf1-retrotransposon (Fig. 7A), of a MIP water channel protein (Fig. 7B), and of an amino acid permease (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, this later peak includes a possible fossil fragment of a bacterial transposase, fused to the amino acid permease sequence in the same reading frame (Supplementary Table S1D). This finding casts light on how random combinatorial protein domains, including exogenous DNA, may contribute to the emergence of new traits during evolution. Gene fragments identified by AnABlast profiles. (A) Peak in the Chr I: 5543318-5543498 interval (forward strand) uncovers a fragment of Tf1 protein (S. pombe ref gb|AAA35339.1|, e-value: 2e-15).

(C) Main AnABlast peak (arrow) at Chr II: 4452616-4452379 encodes a chimeric fragment of amino acid permeases (Chr II: 4452616-4452443, S. pombe ref|NP_596849.1|. e-value: 2e-20) fused in frame to another one sharing significant identity to bacterial transposases (Chr II: 4452444-4452379, Desulfobacter postgatei ref|WP_004074224.1|, 73% identity). (D) Peaks (arrows) at the Chr I: 5153233-5153041 and Chr I: E 5153042-5152866 intervals (reverse strand) encode fragments of cell surface glycoproteins (S. pombe ref|NP_588570.2|, e-values of concatenated sequence: 3e-72).

Pombase annotations and colour codes for reading frames of the analysed genomic intervals are shown. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Our search strategy also identified rearranged fragments of the same gene. Two adjacent genomic intervals coding for partial sequences of a predicted surface glycoprotein (in different reading frames) (Fig. 7D), or up to three different subtelomeric regions encoding adjacent fragments of the RecA protein (encoded by the tlh1/tlh2 genes) provide good examples of rearranged genes. As shown by AnABlast profiles, at least two regions containing tlh1/tlh2 DNA fragments located in subtelomeric regions of Chromosomes I and II, respectively, harbour identical rearranged structures (see Fig. 7E and F). A fragment of the SPAC212.04c gene (DUF999 family protein 1) can also be observed in both subtelomeric intervals (see in Fig. 7), albeit only in the case of Chromosome II this gene fragment is annotated as pseudogene (SPBCPT2R1.05c). According to AnABlast peaks, this pseudogene should be also annotated as new pseudogene in the equivalent Chromosome I subtelomeric region.Interestingly, the identical genomic gene fragments pattern revealed by AnABlast profiles in both subtelomeric intervals suggests that evolutionary events yielding such fragments likely occurred earlier than their translocations to the subtelomeric region. However, we cannot rule out that occasionally, these AnaBlast results could point to possible genome assembly errors rather than rearranged fragments and/or missing annotations.3.7. Fossil-coding sequencesAs described above, BLAST analysis of a particular AnABlast peak identified a possible fossil transposase sequence, perhaps of bacterial origin (see in Fig. 7C). This observation led us to investigate whether other AnABlast peaks could identify fossil sequences30 transferred from other genomes.Importantly, AnABlast identified a coding sequence containing a protein domain of the mitochondrial maturase protein-2 (SPMIT.03 mitochondrial gene), indicating that this genome fragment has a mitochondrial origin (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, additional transposase and trehalose synthase fragments (Fig. 8B and C, respectively) point to a possible horizontal transfer from bacteria as an evolutionary source for these intergenic sequences.31 A short region encoding amino acid sequences highly similar to cytochrome c oxidase subunit III was also identified (Fig. 8D).

ConclusionHere we report that low-stringency alignments accumulation in predicted amino acid sequences may discern coding from non-coding DNA, thereby providing a new in silico strategy (AnABlast) to reveal present and ancient coding regions in sequenced DNA. We have shown that the identification of rearranged and fossil sequences by AnABlast may be helpful to better understand the evolutionary history of the S. pombe genome. This property, together with the ability to uncover novel genes and pseudogenes, suggests that AnABlast provides a new strategy of general interest for the genome-wide search of present and fossil sequences in any genome.Authors' contributionJ.J. and A.P.P. conceived the study and designed the experiments.

IntroductionThe knowledge on the link between functional diversity and species richness is one of the key areas that is lacking for better understanding of ecosystem functioning in soils,1–3 Ecosystems such as soil have vast diverse microorganisms with several thousand complex functional capabilities.4,5 Novel technological advancements are thought to be a way towards the understanding of microbial functional diversity in biogeochemical processes more clearly.6 Several molecular methods like PCR, RFLP, microarrays and sequencing have been utilized in the field of ecology, and in recent years high-throughput sequencing has proven to be efficient in characterizing the diversity of microorganisms in ecological systems.7 Whole metagenomic sequencing is currently limited by its coverage as the interesting regions can form a very low proportion of the whole nucleic acid amounts and will thus not be obtained in the large data set.8,9 Amplicon sequencing through PCR primers is an alternative way to specifically obtain the less abundant genomic regions of interest, which becomes harder when there are several thousand functional targets.10,11 Large-scale functional gene microarrays such as the Geochip12 has been chosen as an alternative method by targeting several specific genes involved in ecosystem functioning. This method was useful but also had problems related to specificity and sensitivity of the fragments of DNA binding to the probes which are difficult to control.13 Although targeted approach could be very informative, it is important to note that these are confined only to known and well-annotated sequence information available in public databases.14We suggest using a technique, called ‘sequence capture’, to sequence a large number of genes that could be used for analysing the functions of environmental communities at a significantly higher resolution than what has been possible with other approaches. It involves a selection of specific genomic loci through adhesion to probes and sequencing only the DNA fragments that are bound to the probes.15 The main advantage of the method is its ability to efficiently enrich for genes that are in very low abundance in the gene pool.16 It has been predominantly used in the field of medicine to study disease-related point mutations in the human genome.17–20 Sequence capture has also been implemented for use in several non-model organisms such as chipmunks (Tamilas),21 sugarcane (Saccharum)22 and bison (Bos)23 targeting several thousand genomic regions through their closely related species. Sequence capture was also used in a small-scale targeting of two enzymatic regions in a freshwater metagenome from Lake Pavin in France.24In this study, we aim to demonstrate the application of sequence capture on a large scale for the first time on microbial communities of agricultural soils. The focus was to identify and enhance the capture of functional genes coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes and secretory proteases that are related to organic matter degradation were identified from the public databases were targeted in this method25–27 and subsequently targeted using sequence capture. The probe design was customized to target functional enzymes of soil microorganisms in natural soil communities using MetCap28 and allows for efficient targeting hundreds of thousands of genes. In short, MetCap is a web-based probe-designing pipeline that takes user's sequences of interest and design probes for targeting those sequences optimized for sequence capture. The soil metagenomic DNA was targeted at four different probe hybridization stringencies and sequenced with high-throughput sequencing. Here we determine that: (i) the custom-designed sequence capture is efficient in enriching for functional targets in the metagenomic data sets and the effect of hybridization stringencies was investigated, (ii) the correlation of taxonomic distribution of the targeted metagenomes to their respective traditional ribosomal 16S rDNA libraries is very high and (iii) a comparative metagenomic analyses of the eight captured metagenomes with 22 publicly available soil whole metagenomes from the MG-RAST metagenome database illustrated the efficient enrichment using sequence capture compared with standard shotgun whole metagenome sequencing (WMG).2. Materials and methods2.1. Soil samples and DNA extractionTwo soils from Bjornstorp, located in the southern region (Scania) of Sweden that is part of a land-use management study,29 were sampled to test the proposed sequence capture method. The soil samples were from agricultural fields, one from a winter wheat field and the other from grassland nearby the wheat field (Supplementary Table S1). At each field, several sub-samples were collected from different spots (0–15 cm depth) and mixed together. The soils were transported in cold boxes and sieved (2.5 mm) and then stored in a -20°C freezer. Then refrigerated at 4°C before proceeding to DNA extraction. DNA from both samples was extracted using Nucleospin soil DNA isolation kit (Macherey & Nagel, Duren, Germany). The extractions were carried out according to the manufacturer with 0.5 g of soil as the starting material. The extracted DNA was tested for quality (A260/280) and concentration using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, NC, USA). Multiple extractions were carried out for each sample, and the extraction with highest yield and best quality was chosen for amplicon and sequence capture (SeqCap) library preparation steps.2.2. SeqCap EZ probe generationEnzymes from Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database (CAZy)25 and proteases from the MEROPS database27 having a predicted secretion signal based on signalP v430 were chosen. In total, 306,525 sequences were selected for probe generation of which 260,731 were from CAZy and 45,794 were from MEROPS. The nucleotide coding sequences of these genes were used to design probes for sequence capture, and a local sequence database was created with these sequences (subsequently called target database, TDB). The probes were generated based on these sequences using the MetCap pipeline, where the sequences were clustered with 90% sequence similarity and on an average three probes were generated from each cluster and more details of these probes were described in Kushwaha et al.28 In total, 406,277 probes were generated with 351,482 from CAZy and 54,795 from MEROPS. They were generated with melting temperature (50°C) and probe length (50mer) that are suitable to use with protocol based on NimbleGen SeqCap EZ (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.).2.3. SeqCap designThe design of the SeqCap protocol has been modified and tested for the hybridization stringency on target sequence binding specificity, to account for the combination of variability in metagenomic samples and the number of target regions. To test for this stringency, ‘hybridization time’ has been chosen as a factor, since it is effective, and it is also least dependent on other parameters of the protocol making it easy to handle according to the recommendations of Roche NimbleGen, Inc. The metagenomic SeqCap setup was designed to test both soil samples at four different hybridization times. Along with the recommended 72 h (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) hybridization time for probes and DNA fragments at 47°C, three (24, 16 and 8 h) less-stringent hybridization times have been tested, where 72 h was expected to be most stringent and 8 h to be the least stringent in binding specificity against the target genes.2.4. SeqCap library preparationFour libraries were constructed from each soil DNA sample (4 hybridization times × 2 soil samples), following manufacturer's instructions from GS FLX rapid library preparation method (Roche). A total of 500 ng of each DNA sample was fragmented using a Nebulizer (Roche) along with nebulization buffers at 2.1 bar pressure to get the average fragment length in the range of 700 bp. This length is the recommended fragment length for the combination of sequence captures using SeqCap EZ probes coupled with 454 GS FLX sequencing (NimbleGen, Roche). The cleaned fragments were then subjected to the end repair treatment (Roche) followed by 454-adapter ligation. To make multiplexing possible in both cases of sequence capture and sequencing, each library was prepared with a specific MID (Multiplexing Identifier) on its 454 adapters (Lib-L). Each of the eight libraries contained a unique MID, and the qualities of the libraries were checked with High Sensitivity DNA chip (Bioanalyzer, Agilent) at the end of the library preparation step. Before subjecting the fragments to hybridization with probes, a ligation-mediated (LM) PCR (pre-capture) with the 454 adapters as primers was done with FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) with only 12 cycles and purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Limburg, The Netherlands), so as to increase the amount of DNA fragments for hybridization step that passed adapter ligation step.2.5. Sequence captureThe actual sequence capture process has been carried out with the capture protocol (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) with adjustments in hybridization time as described in the design. The following steps are according to the standard SeqCap EZ protocol (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.). The hybridization step was multiplexed and carried out for each hybridization time as the libraries contain MIDs. For each hybridization time, 1 µg (500 ng from each soil DNA) of amplified libraries together with hybridization-enhancing oligos was dried in a DNA vacuum concentrator. The corresponding DNA libraries were dried, so that there were four dried samples representing each hybridization time. Hybridization buffers were added to the libraries and heated at 95°C for 10 min to denature the DNA fragments. Then the probes (6.5 µl/reaction) were added to the denatured libraries immediately and incubated at 47°C in a thermal cycler with a heated cover at 57°C for respective hybridization times. After the hybridization, the libraries were washed with buffers specified in the SeqCap EZ protocol (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) along with streptavidin dynabeads at 47°C and magnetic device to retain just the hybridized fragments with probes and remove unbound fragments. These captured DNA fragments bound to probes that were attached to the dynabeads were used as template in a LM-PCR (post-capture) reaction by which the captured DNA fragments were amplified and also separated from the beads/probes. These samples were checked again with a Bioanalyzer to ensure that the DNA fragments were captured and to check for primer dimers. The captured DNA fragments were purified two times using AmpPure Bead (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, USA) purification method for the removal of any primer dimers from the post-capture LM PCR that could hinder in the sequencing step. The quantities of double-stranded DNA in these four captured DNA libraries were measured using Quant-it Pico Green kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).2.6. 16s rDNA amplicon library preparationAs part of the sample analysis, bacterial species composition was studied through amplicon sequencing of ribosomal DNA from these soil samples. Amplicon libraries were prepared by running a PCR with fusion primers optimized for 454 sequencing. Fusion primers for bacterial 16S rDNA V3-V4 region were designed using the forward primer B341F [‘CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG’] and 454 (Lib-A) adapter-A and the reverse primer B805R [‘GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC’] preceded by 454 (Lib-A) adapter-B with a MID.31 All amplicon libraries were prepared using reagents based on Phire Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The pre-PCR mix was prepared in the same proportion for each sample totaling to 25 µl (5 µl-5× Buffer; 0.5 µl-10 mM dNTPs; 1 µl-10 µM forward primer; 2 µl-5 µM reverse primer; 0.5 µl-DNA polymerase; 0.5 µl-bovine serum albumin; 2.5 µl-Template DNA; 13 µl-MilliQ water). The PCR conditions for 16S rDNA amplification were as follows: initial denaturation step at 98°C for 30 s; 27 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 5 s, annealing at 56°C for 5 s, extension at 72°C for 10 s; final extension at 72°C for 60 s. Three 25 µl PCR reactions were run separately for each sample and pooled together. These PCR amplicons were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and the quantity was measured using Quant-it Pico Green kit (Invitrogen).2.7. 454 sequencingThe SeqCap and amplicon libraries were sequenced separately with Lib-L and Lib-A chemistry, respectively (Roche 454, Shirley, NY, USA). The multiplexing (MID) option used in both SeqCap and amplicon libraries facilitate sequencing them as respective pools to yield more sequencing depth and then to separate the libraries computationally. For SeqCap pool, equal amounts of captured DNA from all four different hybridizations were pooled together. The pooled captured libraries were sequenced in the sequencing facility at Lund University on a whole plate of GS FLX Titanium series with Lib-L chemistry in two regions. For amplicon libraries, both 16S rDNA amplicon libraries were sequenced as part of an amplicon pool made from equal amounts of 24 other amplicon libraries. This amplicon pool was sequenced in a 1/4 plate using a GS FLX Titanium series with Lib-A chemistry also sequenced at the same facility. The sequence data related to the captured metagenomes can be found on the MG-RAST server with their specific Metagenome IDs (WS-72: 4527652.3, WS-24: 4529373.3, WS-16: 4529786.3, WS-8: 4528934.3, GL-72: 4527653.3, GL-24: 4529374.3, GL-16: 4529787.3 and GL-8: 4528937.3). The 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing data can be found in the study accession number PRJEB9530 at EMBL (WS-16S: ERS743453 and GL-16S: ERS743454).2.8. Data analysisThe sequencing output from both regions in the captured libraries was separated based on their MID tags into their respective eight different data sets. The sequence reads from each of these captured data sets were processed through MG-RAST,32 an online tool that is mainly used for functional annotations of metagenomic sequences. The default parameters for quality filtering in MG-RAST were used to remove reads with bad quality and to remove artificial sequence duplicates.33 The filtered sequence reads were used in further analysis. The optimal hybridization time with respect to this particular set of probe design method was deduced based on the enrichment efficiency (fraction of on-targets) for each hybridization time. On-targets were identified through sequence similarity (blastx, E-value of 10-5) with the target database (TDB) consisting of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secreted proteases.25–27The functional assignment of sequences from captured metagenomes was also carried out in MG-RAST based on sequence similarity matches with different databases along with SEED34 database where reads were annotated with different subsystems (E-value of 10-5). The CAZy domains were predicted from the captured metagenomes using CAZy Analysis Toolkit (CAT) with E-value cut-off of 10-5.35 The taxonomic analysis of captured metagenomes has been analysed mainly based on counts for each taxa obtained from MG-RAST.32 The amplicon metagenomes were processed with QIIME36 in combination with Greengenes37 for 16S rDNA amplicons as a resource for taxonomy assignments. The taxonomic distributions from the amplicon metagenomes were compared with that of the captured metagenomes. A comparative metagenomic analyses between the eight captured metagenomes along with 22 publicly available whole metagenomes (WMG) (Supplementary Table S6) also from soil sequenced with 454 were achieved through the R package ‘matR’ in MG-RAST.38 These metagenomes were also normalized with log transformation and centred for each sample using ‘matR’. STAMP39 was used for the visualization and the statistics of the comparative metagenomic data sets with Bonferroni correction for P-values. The CAZy domains were predicted for two of the intensively sequenced, publicly available whole metagenomes and compared with the captured metagenomes from our study.3. ResultsIn total, 914,996 sequence reads were obtained from the SeqCap pool. The number of sequences with good quality (after QC and dereplication) for all eight samples was uniform and ranged between 89,281 and 129,198 per sample (Supplementary Table S2). The targeted metagenomes that were sequenced with 454 pyrosequencing generated >850,000 reads with an average read length of 348 after quality control (QC). The fraction of reads removed through QC was consistent (~7%) among all eight captured metagenomes. In total from the amplicon pool, 4,990 sequence reads were obtained from 16S rDNA amplicons after QC from both the wheat soil (WS) and grassland soil (GL), respectively.3.1. Capture efficiencyThe efficiency of different hybridization times to enrich for the sequences of interest was measured as the proportion of reads with significant similarity to proteins sequences in the TDB (Fig. 1A). The fraction of reads that matched (blastx) to TDB varied from 27 ± 1% for the shortest hybridization time (8 h) to 40 ± 2% for the longest hybridization time (72 h). The total number of reads that belonged to the carbohydrate subsystem from SEED34 and the fraction of reads that have a predicted CAZy domain from CAT35 also increased with increase in hybridization times for both samples (Supplementary Fig. S1). The capture efficiencies of the different hybridization times obtained through three independent methods (Supplementary Fig. S1) showed that 72 h hybridization time was most efficient in enriching targets from metagenomes. (A) The capture efficiency in relation to different hybridization times from the wheat (WS) and grassland (GL) soils calculated as fraction (%) of total filtered reads that had a significant sequence match (blastx) to the protein sequences from TDB. (B) Rarefaction curves of unique enzyme IDs (UniProt) from random sampling of filtered sequence reads from the captured metagenomes.

(B) Rarefaction curves of unique enzyme IDs (UniProt) from random sampling of filtered sequence reads from the captured metagenomes. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.The abundance of each enzyme (Uniprot enzyme ID) based on the number of reads that matched the enzymes in TDB sequences through blastx was obtained for each metagenome. The rarefaction curve (Fig. 1B) for unique enzymes in each metagenome also depicts the variation between hybridization times for both soil samples. The metagenomes in terms of enzyme abundance counts were significantly explained by hybridization time when they were homogenized for soil types (ANOSIM: P = 0.04). The 72 h hybridization time had more unique enzymes and more on-target matches than the other times in any given amount of random sampling of sequences.3.2. Taxonomic distribution of the metagenomesThe captured metagenomes were dominated by sequences of the bacterial phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in both soil samples. Comparative taxonomic analysis of metagenomes was based on the relative abundances of different genera (both bacteria and fungi). The taxonomic groups of the captured metagenomes from the same soil type were significantly similar (PERMANOVA: P < 0.001, R2 = 0.74; ANOSIM: P = 0.03), while the hybridization time did not have any effect on their taxonomic distribution (PERMANOVA: P = 0.45; ANOSIM: P = 0.22) (Fig. 2A). The high-stringency (72 h) metagenomes were used for the taxonomic comparison to the taxonomic distribution obtained from the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of respective soil samples (WS-16 and GL-16). The relative abundances of bacterial taxa in the captured metagenomes (72 h) from MG-RAST were well correlated with their respective 16S rDNA amplicons (Fig. 2B). The taxonomic representations of the captured metagenomes were similar to that of the representations obtained from the ribosomal amplicon metagenomes. The taxonomy distributions between amplicon libraries and the captured metagenomes were significantly correlated at different levels of taxa for both soil types (Supplementary Table S3). (A) In an NMDS plot based on Bray–Curtis distances, the taxonomic distributions from the eight captured metagenomes show that the metagenomes from the same soil wheat (WS) and grassland (GL) cluster together (NMDS: stress = 0.04; PERMANOVA: R2 = 0.74, P < 0.001).

Functional distribution of the metagenomesThe functional annotations based on the different databases available in MG-RAST showed that the fraction of reads annotated with functional proteins increased with longer hybridization time for both soil samples (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the fraction of reads that had neither protein similarity nor functional annotation was constant in all captured metagenomes (12.5 ± 1%). The subgroup of reads with KEGG orthology annotations (KO) (identity =60% and length =15 aa) showed that >85% of these proteins were involved in metabolism (Supplementary Table S4). Also, >70% of those metabolic reads were particularly involved in carbohydrate metabolism in both wheat and grassland soil with high-stringent hybridization time (WS-72: 18,628 reads; GL-72: 15,900 reads) (Fig. 3A) and are part of >200 different KO functional groups. This is followed by synthesis of secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism. These four metabolic categories constitute >90% of all the metabolic annotations.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Among the different annotation sources in the MG-RAST server, the SEED-based subsystem had the most abundant annotations with 943 different subsystems (Level 3) annotated at least two times among the eight captured metagenomes. Comparing the abundances of broader subsystems (Level 1), the carbohydrates subsystem was the most abundant (WS-72: 35% and GL-72: 36%) followed by the clustering-based subsystem (functionally coupled genes) (WS-72: 33% and GL-72: 35%). The three most abundant finer (Level 3) subsystems that were found in both wheat (WS-72) and grassland soil (GL-72) were trehalose biosynthesis, glycogen metabolism and glycogen metabolism cluster which form ~50% of the entire subsystems. The blastx matches obtained against the TDB sequences showed that ~75% of the matches were annotated to CAZy enzymes and the rest were proteases for both soils (WS-72, GL-72). Among the different enzyme families, the most abundant bacterial family was the glycosyl hydrolase 13 (GH13) in the CAZy database (WS-72: 41%, GL-72: 45%). This was followed by metalloproteases (WS-72: 13%, GL-72: 11%) and serine proteases (WS-72: 13%, GL-72: 10%) in both soils.3.4. CAZy analysisOut of 331 different CAZy enzyme families, 243 were found in both soil samples (WS-72 and GL-72) at least through one of the three methods of annotation (CAT, MG-RAST and blastx) (Supplementary Table S5). The number of different enzyme families captured in each CAZy enzyme class varied between the soil samples and the enzyme class (Fig. 3B). Larger number of enzyme families from glycosyl transferase (GT) class was not found in both metagenomes (WS-72 and GL-72) compared with other enzyme classes. Glycosyl hydrolases were the most abundant enzyme class from all three methods in both metagenomes (WS-72 and GL-72). The most abundant glycosyl hydrolase enzyme family GH13 was predicted along with carbon binding motif CBM48 from the domain predictor (CAT). The fractions of reads with GH13 domain along with CBM48 (WS-72: 39%, GL-72: 46%) were the most abundant next to GH13 domains (WS-72: 17%, GL-72: 17%) that were predicted independently.3.5. Comparative metagenomicsAs all the captured metagenomes in this study represented two soils, the metagenomes from the different hybridization times were treated as replicates and the different enzyme IDs among the portion of on-targets (removing the off-targets) that matched (blastx) to TDB was very similar within each soil type (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the abundances of different SEED-based subsystems (Level 3) from MG-RAST after normalization were analysed for the eight captured metagenomes (Fig. 4B). The subsystem abundances in these eight captured metagenomes were significantly affected by both soil type (PERMANOVA: P < 0.001) and hybridization times (PERMANOVA: P < 0.01). Enzymes such as amino-peptidisases, GH10 and GH36 for example were highly enriched in grassland (GL) while enzymes related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis and GH46 were highly enriched in the wheat field (WS) (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.To elucidate the ability of captured metagenomics, a number of whole metagenomic data sets from soil (WMG) that were deeply sequenced by pyrosequencing and were publicly available in MG-RAST were chosen for comparison. Some of these public metagenomes were sequenced to a depth >10 times that of the captured metagenomes in our study. Two of WMG have been analysed for CAT, since it only allows 50,000 sequences to be analysed per run. The fraction of reads that contained CAZy domains in the captured metagenomes was more than five times higher than the possible untargeted metagenomes despite the coverage of sequencing (Table 1). The most abundant enzyme family GT2 in the two public metagenomes formed only ~0.8 and 0.2% of the total reads, whereas in our targeted approach the two most common enzyme families were GH13 together with CBM48 and represented 12% of the WS-72 and 13% of the GL-72 metagenomes. The fraction of reads predicted with CAZy domains from the captured metagenomes is at least five times more than intensively sequenced public WMGCAZy, Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes; WMG, whole metagenome sequencing.The fraction of reads predicted with CAZy domains from the captured metagenomes is at least five times more than intensively sequenced public WMGCAZy, Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes; WMG, whole metagenome sequencing.In total, 22 publicly available whole metagenomes were used for comparison towards the two captured metagenomes (WS-72 and GL-72). After normalization of these 24 metagenomes, there were 1,124 subsystems (Level 3) whose abundances were compared between the metagenomes. Among these subsystems, there were 390 subsystems that had a significant difference in the relative frequencies (P < 0.05, q < 0.05) between the whole metagenomes and captured metagenomes (Fig. 5) (PERMANOVA: P < 0.001, R2 = 0.59). The most common subsystems that were significantly enriched in the captured metagenomes (Supplementary Table S7) belonged to: carbohydrates (43), clustering-based subsystem (45) and protein metabolism (18). The captured metagenomes are highly efficient in enriching for sequences related to carbohydrate subsystem as expected through design compared with the whole metagenomes (Fig. 6).

DiscussionThis study has for the first time applied a targeted metagenomic approach to study genes of more than hundreds of different enzyme families in environmental samples. The approach was successfully demonstrated for soil from two different land-use types, grass and wheat, but is applicable to any metagenome. The soil functional diversity can be efficiently investigated by using the sequence capture technique that has been developed with an online web tool for probe design28 for genes encoding enzymes regulating specific functional mechanisms in ecosystems. This method circumvents the inefficiency due to coverage or high labour demand for gene targeting, of the techniques that are commonly applied for the study of community functions.8,9,13,40 We have applied this technique successfully for two different soil metagenomes to target enzymes involved in organic matter degradation.The abundances of these target enzymes in each captured metagenome were significantly affected by the hybridization time. However, the diversity of these targeted enzymes was consistent within each soil regardless of their hybridization time. This shows that stringent hybridization, in terms of hybridization time, increases the enrichment of target genes while maintaining the diversity. It could also be inferred that this technique is reproducible as there is an increase in target enrichment while maintaining diversity at higher hybridization stringencies for both metagenomes. Lower hybridization stringencies also increase the fraction of proteins without any annotations in the public databases in the metagenome. This is mainly due to the random hybridizations of DNA fragments to probes (i.e. increased number of off-targets), which would be less likely at higher stringencies. Since this technique involves sequencing of the hybridized fragments, it provides the advantage of separating out the randomly bound fragments from the ones that contain functional annotation compared with microarray-based techniques.13 It is also important to note that these fragments were sequenced with 454 for longer sequence reads. As 454 frequently does not sequence the entire DNA fragment, adjacent non-coding region instead of the region bound to the probe might have been sequenced, which could also hinder their functional annotations. In addition, 454 also has higher per-base sequencing errors like homopolymer errors41 that could cause problems while matching sequence reads for homology in databases. These issues could be solved with other less error-prone sequencing technologies such as Illumina.Most of the metabolic gene predictions in the captured metagenomic datasets for both soils were annotated to carbohydrate metabolism. Other major metabolic components (e.g. amino acid metabolism) of the captured metagenomes are also related to organic matter degradation. This clearly illustrates the efficiency of using our customized probes to enrich for regions of interest in a complex metagenome and is a highly suitable approach to increase the understanding of a particular environmental process. Similarly in the subsystem analysis, the most abundant subsystem (Level 1) was carbohydrates, also showing the efficiency of this capture technique. The second most abundant subsystem, clustering-based subsystems, are the genetic regions that are collocated to functional genes in the genomes of different taxa, but their functions are not well known.42 We suggest that these genes are abundant, because they are sequenced along with the targeted genetic DNA fragments. The functional subsystems distribution between the captured metagenomes was mainly influenced by their soil type rather than their hybridization stringency, although both properties significantly affected their distribution. This shows that this targeted metagenomics approach does not bias the functional representation of the soils even at very high stringency. The results clearly show the efficiency of applying this method to provide insights into important ecological questions, such as understanding key processes in complex environments.The number of different CAZy enzyme families found from these metagenomes also shows the ability of this target enrichment strategy to obtain reliable data for >200 enzyme families at different taxonomic levels. It is to be noted that an efficient enrichment of proteases was also obtained along with CAZy enzymes, although there are common enzymes between the two databases CAZy and MEROPS. Due to our approach, the numbers of CAZy enzyme families found in our metagenomes are much higher to what has been reported in earlier findings.43,44 Despite this, some enzyme families from certain enzyme class like GT were not acquired completely. This could be due to the inefficiency of probes targeting of these families or the very low abundance of these enzyme classes in these soils. Also, these enzyme classes could co-occur with other enzyme families and the annotations like blast would predict one of those with higher scores. For example, the glycosyl hydrolase 13, one of the major CAZy enzyme families, frequently co-occur with CBM4845 and is the most abundant enzyme family in captured metagenomes. GH13 enzyme catalysis is known to be an important step in trehalose biosynthesis,46 and this biosynthesis is also the most abundant subsystem in the captured metagenomes.The taxonomic analysis of the captured metagenomes from MG-RAST showed that the target enrichment strategy applied here does not appear to bias the targeting towards any particular taxonomic group. The taxonomic distribution between all captured metagenomes was significantly explained by their soil type rather than the hybridization times. It is evident that even at the high stringency, captured metagenomes have a similar taxonomic distribution as the other metagenomes from the same soil. Hence, the developed sequence capture method does not have any taxonomic bias. This was further supported by the significant correlations between captured metagenomes (WS-72 and GL-72) and the amplicon metagenomes based on the relative abundances of taxa at different levels. The changes in certain taxa between captured metagenomes and amplicon sequencing could be explained through the availability of functional information of particular taxa. The phylum acidobacteria, for example, is represented highly in 16S rDNA amplicon data but not in case of the captured metagenomes. This can be explained partially that it is well known for its abundance in soil communities but has not been extensively studied for their functions.47,48 The fraction of genes coding for enzymes from Acidobacteria used for our probe were measured to be only 0.6% in TDB, also only 0.9% among the other bacterial enzymes. This limitation is not due to the capture technique, but rather due to biases in the public databases. Several ongoing projects are aiming at increasing the resolution of these under-studied organisms through genome sequencing,49,50 which will be helpful in understanding the ecosystems better in the future.The comparison of CAZy domains from captured metagenomes to publicly available whole metagenomes showed that enrichment through probes was more efficient than intensive sequencing to identify lowly abundant functional genes. Even the most abundant CAZy domains were <1% in WMG, showing the inability of whole metagenomic approach to obtain these important genes.51 However, our targeted approach efficiently enriched for genes that were targeted, at considerably lower sequencing depths. The abundance of enzymes related to carbon cycling from captured metagenomes was much higher than the whole metagenomes (WMG) despite that the WMG was very deeply sequenced. These 22 WMG were obtained from different soils at different conditions, including metagenomes from places like rain forest in Puerto Rico, permafrost and high arctic soils which are known to have communities with higher organic matter degradation capabilities.51–53The differences between two soil communities (WS and GL) were deducible with the availability of abundance and richness of the enzymes in captured metagenomes. It was clear that enzyme families such as GH10 coding for xylanases10 were abundant in grassland as expected since it is related to degradation of plant cell-wall material. Similarly amino peptidases are also found abundant in grassland, as the soil does not receive any free nitrogen as in the case of wheat soil through fertilization. This also shows the ability of captured metagenomics to explain soil functionality. Although, it is important to note that the probes used in this method depend on known functions/enzymes in databases and the information related to unknown functions/enzymes in communities may only be obtained if they were genetically similar. WMG could still be a way of obtaining such information in these particular cases but not to forget that annotating them could still be a subject of biases.54This study has for the first time implemented the sequence capture technique to study the functional diversity of enzymes degrading organic matter in natural soil communities. This approach has the ability to solve the coverage issues with the WMG to get enough amounts of representative sequences.55 We also argue that it is superior to the large-scale microarrays56 since it is able to detect unspecific binding of DNA fragments to the probes and facilitates the discovery of novel genes. It has also been clearly shown, based on multiple hybridization stringencies, that this technique is highly stable and reproducible. As this method represents the taxonomic diversity very well, it could be used to understand the relation between the taxonomic and functional diversity present in the environmental communities.1 As mentioned in Fierer et al.,40 this approach would be an excellent tool for measuring ‘community aggregated traits’ (CAT) and hence proved an integrated understanding of the functional capabilities of complex microbial ecosystems. The relative functional gene abundances from different samples, as traits irrespective of its taxonomic origin, are a better way to determine the functional capabilities of the community. Overall, this method demonstrates its ability to improve our understanding of those community functions in different ecological processes of interest and is applicable even to the most complex metagenomes.Conflict of interest statementNone declared.FundingThis work was supported by The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (215-2010-1679).

Our data confirmed the compositional differences between monocots and dicots, with the former featuring in general a lower background compositional bias but a higher overall codon bias.1. IntroductionThe genetic code is redundant, with most amino acids encoded by two or more synonymous codons.1–4 The non-random use of synonymous codons is known as codon bias, and it may reflect several underlying factors, including mutational bias in the genome and translational selection. The possibility that mutational bias affects codon usage has led to the neutralist model, in which codon identity is mainly determined by nucleotide substitution patterns in the genome. In contrast, the possibility of translational selection has led to the selective model, in which the choice of synonymous codons reflects tRNA abundance5 to optimize the efficiency4 and accuracy6 of translation. These models are not mutually exclusive, i.e. the choice among synonymous codons may reflect a balance between selective and mutational pressures.7Species-dependent differences in codon usage are well known,8 but recent studies have identified variations within species that must also be addressed by the neutralist and selective models. For example, the abundance of tRNA may vary during development and in response to external stimuli,9 suggesting that codon bias may represent an adaptive response to tRNA levels that differ among plant tissues.10 Nucleotide substitution patterns are also unequally distributed in the genome,11 e.g. there are large homogeneous blocks G + C rich sequences known as isochores in the genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates.12,13 Likewise, differences in nucleotide substitution patterns have been observed in rice (Oryza sativa), with genes expressed in the roots being predominantly G + C rich and genes expressed in seeds and leaves being predominantly A + T rich.14The compositional context can also influence synonymous codon selection, a phenomenon known as context-dependent codon bias (CCDB). In mammals, bacteria and plants, the first nucleotide after each codon drives synonymous codon choice, because several dinucleotide sequences such as CG, GA and TA are under-represented.15–17 In plant genomes, there is also a general bias in the use of specific dinucleotides and trinucleotides in different genomic regions.11,18The composition of coding sequences is determined by a complex series of interacting factors, so it is difficult to identify the relative impact of different components. A model to determine the influence of nucleotide substitution patterns on codon bias has been developed by building a new set of sequences in which the third codon position in the coding sequence is replaced with a random nucleotide from the neighbouring intergenic region.19 Such intergenic corrected coding sequences (ICCSs) retain the same amino acid sequence while mirroring the background nucleotide substitution pattern of the genome. Comparing the codon bias between the original coding sequence (CS) and ICCS datasets can therefore highlight the influence of the background nucleotide substitution pattern on the coding sequence composition.19Although the selective model has been studied in several plant species, the impact of background composition on gene structure has been largely overlooked. Codon bias in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) tends to be associated with the composition of the 3' flanking region in both strongly and weakly expressed genes,20 although the impact of selection on both classes of genes has also been recognized. Here we used the Hershberg and Petrov approach19 to determine the effect of background composition on the codon bias of 21 plant species while also accounting for bias in the frequencies of dinucleotides and trinucleotides. We discuss in detail the impact of these multiple factors and others influencing codon bias in plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence dataThe genomic sequences and annotation data for 21 plant species were downloaded from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net).21 We analysed the sequences of 4 monocots [Brachypodium distachyon (BD), O. sativa (OS), Sorghum bicolor (SB) and Zea mays (ZM)], 15 dicots [Arabidopsis lyrata (AL), A. thaliana (AT), Brassica rapa (BR), Citrus clementina (CC), Citrus sinensis (CS), Eucalyptus grandis (EG), Glycine max (GM), Linum usitatissimum (LU), Medicago truncatula (MT), Populus trichocarpa (PopT), Phaseolus vulgaris (PV), Solanum lycopersicum (SL), Solanum tuberosum (ST), Thellungiella halophila (TH) and Vitis vinifera (VV)] and 2 mosses [Physcomitrella patens (PP) and Selaginella moellendorffii (SM)].We used gff2sequence22 to identify coding sequences, proteins, introns and intergenic sequences. Coding sequences featuring non-canonical bases (other than A, C, G or T), missing stop codons or incomplete triplets were excluded. Finally, the longest splicing variant was chosen when multiple transcripts representing the same gene were annotated if not otherwise specified. Monocot coding sequences were divided into three subsets for analysis: (i) the entire genome, (ii) high G + C (HGC) content genes, >60% and (iii) low G + C (LGC) content genes, =60%.2.2. Expression dataGene expression data for Arabidopsis and rice were downloaded from the Plexdb database (http://www.plexdb.org/).23 We chose the expression atlases representing Arabidopsis dataset AT40 (http://www.plexdb.org/modules/PD_browse/experiment_browser.php?experiment=AT40) and rice dataset OS9 (http://www.plexdb.org/modules/PD_browse/experiment_browser.php?experiment=OS9). All the expression data were normalized by robust multi-array averaging (RMA). An expression value was calculated for each gene by averaging the replicates within each experiment and then computing a mean value over all the experiments in which the corresponding gene was expressed.242.3. Intergenic controlled coding sequencesFor each gene, the first 100 two-fold and four-fold degenerate codons were used to create the coding sequence for analysis. Transcripts with fewer degenerate codons were excluded. The ICCSs were generated to estimate the influence of the background composition on coding sequence codon bias. Upstream and downstream sequences longer than 50 bp were extracted from the leading strand and joined together to form a set of concatenated intergenic sequences (CISs).Four different background controls were used to generate the ICCS datasets, beginning with the mononucleotide composition as originally used in the Hershberg and Petrov method.19 Briefly, a subsequence of 100 consecutive base pairs was randomly selected from the CIS, and the third base of each codon in the coding sequence was replaced with a nucleotide from this CIS subsequence (Fig. 1). This yielded a new data set called monoICCS. The intergenic dinucleotide composition was used to generate a second class of ICCS (dinuICCS) by choosing a random subsequence of 200 consecutive nucleotides from the CIS and picking the second base of each coding sequence codon randomly from within that subsequence. The adjacent base was then selected as the third codon position in the ICCS (Fig. 1). If the CIS was shorter than 100 bp, it was excluded from the monoICCS, and if it was shorter than 200 bp, it was excluded from the dinuICCS. Genes were also excluded from further analysis if any base in the CIS occurred fewer than four times. Method used for the construction of the mononucleotide ICCS (monoICCS), dinucleotide ICCS (dinuICCS) and trinucleotide ICCS (trinuICCS) data sets. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Method used for the construction of the mononucleotide ICCS (monoICCS), dinucleotide ICCS (dinuICCS) and trinucleotide ICCS (trinuICCS) data sets. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Intergenic trinucleotide controlled coding sequences (trinuICCS) were produced by randomly picking the first dinucleotide for each coding sequence codon from within the CIS and selecting the adjacent nucleotide as the third base for the ICCS (Fig. 1). Finally, CDCB was estimated by randomly selecting an interrupted dinucleotide comprising the second base of each coding sequence codon and the first base of the subsequent codon. The intervening nucleotide was then selected as the third codon base in the CDCB intergenic controlled coding sequence (cdcbICCS). Genes in the trinuICCS and cdcbICCS data sets were excluded from further analysis if the corresponding dinucleotide appeared fewer than four times in the CIS.To maintain the coding sequence amino acid structure, two-fold degenerate codons ending in A|G produced an ICCS ending in A when the corresponding intergenic position was A or T, and otherwise the ICCS ended in G. Similarly, two-fold degenerate codons ending in T|C produced an ICCS featuring T at the third codon position when the corresponding CIS nucleotide was A or T, and otherwise the ICCS ended in C.2.4. Codon bias measurementsThe effective number of codons (Nc)25 was used to estimate the overall codon bias for each gene in the CS and ICCS data sets. The Nc index gave higher values for less-biased genes (theoretical values between 21 and 61). To explore the contribution of each individual codon, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values were computed for informative two-fold and four-fold degenerate codons (i.e. excluding methionine, tryptophan, stop codons, as well as three-fold and six-fold degenerate codons to avoid uneven nucleotide representation at the third position within the same codon family). RSCU values were calculated as the ratio of the observed and expected codon frequencies, i.e. the random use of all codons within a specific degenerate family.262.5. Signature of selectionThe association between the RSCU values of the CS and ICCS datasets and the gene expression levels was investigated in Arabidopsis and rice by sorting genes on the basis of their expression levels into 20 bins containing the same number of genes. The bin rank was then plotted against the average CS|ICCS RSCU value within the bin using either the intergenic or intron portion for the construction of the ICCS data set. In the latter case, all introns within the same gene were concatenated. In rice, this analysis was also carried out separately on the HGC and LGC gene sets.Differences in codon bias between the CS and ICCS data sets were also calculated in several different portions of the coding sequences in a subset of plant species (AT, BR, OS, BD, PV, MT and SM). The unequal distribution of codon bias within individual transcripts is a well-known phenomenon that may cause different levels of deviation from the background.27–29 To investigate this phenomenon, we filtered coding sequences >1,500 bp in length and split them into three portions: the 5' region comprising the first 501 nucleotides, the 3' region the last 501 nucleotides and the middle region containing the remaining part of the coding sequence. The <U+0394>RSCU value and its significance were calculated for each of the three portions.The analysis was repeated with the Arabidopsis and rice ICCS data sets using intergenic regions that were masked (e.g. repetitive elements and pseudogenes were removed according to data retrieved from the TAIR and Phytozome websites) and trimmed by 200 bp at both ends. The differences between the CS and ICCS data sets in both species were also analysed separately on genes showing regular or alternative splicing. Finally, the impact of the intergenic distance was investigated by analysing two Arabidopsis and rice data sets, one featuring long intergenic sequences (>1,000 bp for AT and >2,200 bp for OS) and the other featuring short intergenic sequences (=1,000 bp for AT and =2,200 bp for OS).3. Results3.1. Codon bias in the ICCSsMutational bias is one of the main forces affecting synonymous codon choice in plants.30 In theory, if no additional forces act on the coding sequences, the third base of each codon should reflect the background nucleotide frequency in the genome. However, the direction and strength of the codon bias should be investigated in the local genomic context to correct for intragenomic compositional heterogeneity. Several authors have reported the non-random usage of specific dinucleotides31 and trinucleotides11,18 in plant genomes, and thus, the analysis of mutational bias should also take into account these compositional units.We used the composition of intergenic regions as a proxy for background bias according to the Hershberg and Petrov method.19 The portion of codon bias caused by background composition was measured by generating several ICCS data sets taking into account the mononucleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide and context-dependent intergenic composition of each plant species.We investigated the direction of mutational bias by analysing the codon bias among all the ICCS data sets. If the four nucleotides are equally and randomly distributed in the background, then there should be no codon bias in any of the ICCS data sets. In contrast, we observed the opposite trend, i.e. Nc values compatible with a multilevel background compositional bias. Interestingly, the lowest Nc values were found in the dinuICCS data set, revealing the strongest bias for all species (Fig. 2). The intensity of codon bias distinguished monocots and dicots. Whereas eudicots and particularly the legumes (P. vulgaris, M. truncatula and G. max) showed the highest ICCS codon bias at all levels, the opposite trend was observed for the monocots (rice, Z. mays, S. bicolor and B. distachyon) as shown in Fig. 2.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Nc values provide a snapshot of overall codon bias within genes but do not reveal the specific contributions of each codon. ICCS RSCU values were therefore calculated for all codons with two-fold or four-fold degeneracy (Fig. 3). We observed a significant over-representation of codons ending in A|T in the monoICCS data set of the eudicots, particularly V. vinifera, Solanum spp. and the legumes, and likewise in monocots and S. moellendorffii but to a much lesser extent.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.A similar picture emerged from the analysis of the dinuICCS and trinuICCS RSCU values although several compositional signatures also emerged. The codons ending in A|T generally showed higher RSCU values at the expense of those ending in G|C, but the extent of the bias was variable. Indeed, codons ending in CG, AG and AC tended to be suppressed more strongly in the dinuICCS data set, e.g. these dinucleotides were under-represented in the intergenic regions of all the plants whereas codons ending in CA showed the opposite trend (Fig. 3). Only marginal differences were observed between the dinuICCS and trinuICCS data sets, indicating that the intergenic trinucleotide bias is predominantly caused by bias in the frequency of the underlying dinucleotides. Even less difference was observed between the cdcbICCS and trinuICCS datasets, indicating that CDCB does not reflect an analogous compositional pattern at a genomic level.Differences in codon bias were distributed along the chromosomes of both monocots and dicots for all ICCS data sets (Supplementary Fig. S1), but spatial autocorrelation analysis failed to detect a significant effect on the ICCS RSCU values (Supplementary Fig. S2).323.2. Codon bias in the coding sequencesIf synonymous codon choice solely reflects the distribution of nucleotides in the genomic background, there should be no differences in Nc value between the CS and ICCS data sets. However, our results revealed significant differences (Wilcoxon paired sample test) between these data sets, although the direction and extent of divergence were species dependent. Coding sequences were more biased in monocots than in dicots (Fig. 2) in sharp contrast to the comparison of ICCS data sets. Interestingly, the coding sequences were even less biased than the corresponding ICCSs in some species (i.e. GM and PV), with the trend most noticeable when comparing the CS and dinuICCS data sets. These data suggest that additional forces shape the coding sequences and oppose mutational bias, e.g. resulting in G|C enrichment despite background A|T enrichment.Differences in RSCU values between the CS and ICCS data sets allowed us to focus on codons whose frequency cannot be explained by background bias alone. Comparisons between the CS data set and the four ICCS data sets led to similar results (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). All codons ending in A|T were under-represented in the coding sequences, with GTA showing the greatest depletion. In contrast, several codons ending in G|C were over-represented in the coding sequence, with certain species-dependent exceptions. Codons CCC and GGG were suppressed in many species, together with codons CCG, GCG and ACG. The under-representation of these codons together with GTA was more striking when comparing the CS and monoICCS data sets and less pronounced when comparing the CS and dinuICCS data sets, suggesting that such a bias in the coding sequences in part reflects the general suppression of the TA|CG dinucleotide in the intergenic regions (Fig. 3). Some differences between the CS and ICCS data sets were also taxon dependent, e.g. the preference for G|C at the third codon position was more apparent in monocots than in eudicots, particularly M. truncatula, V. vinifera and Solanum spp., where there was little evidence for preference (Fig. 4).

Black crosses in white squares show insignificant differences between the data sets. This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.An unequal distribution of codon bias within individual transcripts has been observed in many species27–29 so we also studied the differences between the CS and ICCS data sets in three different portions of the coding sequences. Accordingly, we observed a variation in <U+0394>RSCU values along the transcript, with the 5' regions featuring the greatest differences (Supplementary Fig. S4).The influence of recurrent motifs within the intergenic regions was tested by using a hard-masked version of the genome and trimming the intergenic portions by 200 bp at each end. Additionally, the impact of intergenic length on the <U+0394>RSCU value was investigated by splitting the original data set into two subsets representing short and long intergenic sequences. In both cases, no differences were observed compared with the original data set (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6).Finally, a recent report has suggested that rice genes experience differential selection depending on whether they undergo regular invariant splicing or alternative splicing.33 We therefore calculated the differences between the CS and ICCS data sets representing each set of genes separately and observed a strong correlation between the results of each analysis (Supplementary Fig. S7).3.3. Correlation between codon bias and gene expression in Arabidopsis and riceCodon bias in the species we investigated was not fully explained by background compositional differences so we investigated the influence of gene expression on synonymous codon usage in the CS and ICCS data sets. Codons that are translated more rapidly or accurately should be preferentially found in the coding sequences of genes, particularly those expressed at high levels. We chose Arabidopsis and rice as representative dicot and monocot species and assigned genes to 20 bins based on expression levels, and then mapped the RSCU values of the CS and the ICCS data sets onto these bins (Fig. 5). This strategy should also reveal additional phenomena other than translational selection. For example, a codon whose frequency is positively associated with expression level may be under selection to optimize translation efficiency and/or accuracy. However, if genes with comparable expression levels share the same composition as the intergenic sequences, this would also generate variation in their ICCS RSCU values. Furthermore, if the RSCU values in the CS and ICCS data sets differ regardless of the expression level, then forces other than the translational selection are likely to be responsible.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.We found that two-fold degenerate codons ending in G|C are more frequent in the coding sequences of rice and Arabidopsis, although in the latter case the aspartic acid codon GAC was an exception. There was no association between expression level and the RSCU values of the ICCSs, suggesting that expression-dependent variation in codon bias does not reflect differences in the background composition of the Arabidopsis genome. Weaker trends were observed in Arabidopsis when the four-fold degenerate codons were analysed both in terms of deviation from the background and variation with expression. Indeed, the frequency of many codons mirrored the background composition of the entire set of bins, so that the curves generated by the CS and ICCS data sets could be superimposed. However, there was a positive association between the RSCU values and expression levels of codons ending in C, and the opposite trend was observed for codons ending in A. Interestingly, the frequency of several codons ending in T was positively associated with the expression level, particularly the alanine codon CGT.A more complex picture emerged from the analysis of rice genes. The correlation between RSCU values and gene expression was non-monotonic for codons with two-fold degeneracy, although as in Arabidopsis the codons ending in G|C were still found more frequently in the coding sequences. However, an initial reduction in the frequency of such codons was complemented by an increase in RSCU values at higher expression levels. If we exclude the effect of the background composition, which again does not vary with the expression level, such non-monotonic trends may reflect the coexistence of contrasting forces whose strength could be dependent on the expression level. Alternatively, the different expression bins in rice may be populated with genes that do not experience the same selective pressure. Indeed, it is well known that monocots have two classes of genes that differ in G + C content.13 For this reason, the above analysis was repeated focusing specifically on LGC and HGC genes. The LGC genes accounted for most of the dataset and mirrored the overall trends discussed above, but the HGC genes showed a general positive association between the expression level and the RSCU values of two-fold degenerate codons ending in G|C.In rice, four-fold degenerate codons ending in G|C were always used more frequently in the coding sequence than the ICCS, whereas the opposite trend was observed for codons ending in A|T. Furthermore, codons ending in G|C were generally used less frequently in strongly expressed genes, whereas there was a positive association between codons ending in T and expression level. As previously reported, such trends are often non-monotonic, either disappearing or changing direction when HGC and LGC genes are analysed separately (Supplementary Fig. S8).The positive association between the RSCU value and expression level of codons ending in T is reminiscent of transcription-associated mutational bias (TAMB), a well-known repair system that increases bias towards G|T rather than C|A in the pre-mRNA sequence.34 For this reason, we repeated our analysis by constructing a new set of ICCSs using intron sequences as a proxy for the background composition. If codons ending in T become more frequent in strongly expressed genes possibly due to TAMB, the same trend should be observed in intron-corrected coding sequences. Our results revealed no such association (Supplementary Fig. S9), indicating that TAMB is not responsible for the positive association between gene expression level and the frequency of codons ending in T.4. DiscussionSeveral ICCS data sets were generated to investigate whether codon bias in the coding sequence reflected the genomic background nucleotide composition of the plant species included in this study. Four ICCS data sets constructed using different strategies were analysed to determine the effective number of codons and RSCU.4.1. Background compositionThe RSCU values of the monoICCS data set revealed the over-representation of A|T compared with G|C although to a different extent in each species. The legumes and solanaceous species showed the greatest difference in the representation of A|T and G|C, whereas there was a weaker distinction in the monocot species, and the brassicas showed intermediate values. G|C to A|T mutations may be more frequent in Arabidopsis, leading to A|T enrichment in the genome.35 The deamination of methylated cytosine residues at CG dinucleotide motifs and the UV-induced mutagenesis of dipyrimidines (CC and TC) were proposed as the main mechanisms to explain this phenomenon.35 Several factors may account for the observed differences in the background nucleotide composition of plants. In monocots, the vertical leaf orientation, protective basal sheath and concealed apical meristem make the interception of solar radiation less efficient,36 thus reducing the prevalence of AT enrichment induced by UV light. Domestication may also contribute to this bias, because A|T pairs contain seven nitrogen atoms compared with the eight present in G|C pairs, which may drive A|T enrichment in non-cultivated plants.37 However, the cluster analysis of ICCS RSCU values revealed a pattern that is consistent with the genomic composition of plants solely depending on phylogeny (Supplementary Fig. S10) rather than the contrast between wild and cultivated plants.A strong dinucleotide compositional bias was evident in the ICCS data set of all species as shown by the higher levels of codon bias (i.e. lower Nc values) in the dinuICCS data set compared with the others (Fig. 2). We found that codons ending in CG were among the most under-represented in the dinuICCS data set, whereas codons ending in CA (the reverse complement of the C deamination product in CG) were among the most over-represented, as recently reported in Arabidopsis and rice.31 Codons ending in CC and TC were also suppressed in the dinuICCS data set, confirming the under-representation of these dinucleotides in non-coding sequences.184.2. Differences between the CS and ICCS data setsThe compositional pattern of several genomes has been investigated at different levels, including the whole genome and the genic portion.18 However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that coding and adjacent non-coding sequences have been directly compared in terms of the mononucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies as well as CDCB. Paired Wilcoxon tests generally revealed significant differences in codon usage between the CS and ICCS data sets in terms of both the Nc and RSCU values. The observed differences were similar in magnitude when comparing the CS data set with all four methods for the construction of ICCS data sets. This finding validates the Hershberg and Petrov method for the identification of optimal codons in plants even though this only considers the mononucleotide composition of the background sequences. The optimal codon data sets calculated using this method could be almost perfectly superimposed over the data sets generated using the other three methods (Supplementary Fig. S11). The comparison between CS and ICCS allowed us to distinguish codon bias caused by genomic compositional features from codon bias related to the expressed portion of the genome.The comparison of CS and ICCS data sets suggested that there was enrichment for codons ending with G or C particularly in monocots, although among the codons ending in G|C the frequency of the complementary codons GGG and CCC was close to the genomic background. This suggests the existence of selection against codons that promote the formation of complex mRNA tertiary structures, and the prevalence of this phenomenon in monocots with their higher overall G + C content may emphasize such an underlying mechanism.Codons ACG, CCG and GCG were marginally over-represented in the coding sequences of some species and under-represented in others. This supports the observation that the CG dinucleotide is suppressed, in part due to deleterious methylation/deamination events. However, our analysis suggested that this phenomenon reflects an underlying genomic tendency, because the effects were not seen when comparing the CS and dinuICCS data sets (Fig. 4).Finally, the general suppression of codon GTA was one of the most conserved features among the plant species we investigated. This is not surprising, because the codon ends with dinucleotide TA, which is known to be suppressed in the coding sequences of several plant species18,31 possibly to discourage insertion events that target the TA dinucleotide,38 to reduce the likelihood of mutations leading to stop codons and to prevent attacks by TA-specific RNases.39 The less striking divergence between the CS and dinuICCS data sets in terms of GTA preference suggests that TA suppression is also a general genomic signature (Fig. 3).We also demonstrated that the differences between the CS and ICCS vary along the transcript (Supplementary Fig. S4), although the background composition cannot explain the observed codon bias in all three portions of the coding sequence that were analysed individually. Differences between CS and ICCS were stronger in the first portion of the transcript in agreement with previous studies reporting stronger selection in the proximal region of the transcript.404.3. Mutational bias in coding sequencesThe background nucleotide pattern alone cannot explain the observed codon bias in the coding sequences, so additional forces must be involved. Indeed, modestly frequent amino acids (or under-represented amino acids in the proteins encoded by strongly expressed genes) may be under weaker selection, and for this reason, their codons may better tolerate changes driven by mutational bias. For example, histidine and cysteine are among the less abundant amino acids in the Arabidopsis proteome, and there is a significant negative correlation between their frequency and the expression level of the corresponding genes (Supplementary Table S1). The frequency of codons CAC (His) and TGC (Cys) in Arabidopsis is similar in the CS and ICCS data sets (Fig. 5). The codons GAC (Asp), GGC (Gly) and GCC (Ala) also revealed biases that mirrored the background composition. Interestingly, these codons feature the generic sequence CNG that has been proposed as the minimal building block for globular proteins and, for this reason, may represent the core of the primitive genetic code.41 Such a trend may therefore reflect the more prolonged effect of mutational bias on the most ancient codons. In contrast, there appeared to be little mutational bias in monocots, where other factors increase the frequency codons ending in G|C.4.4. Translational selection and mRNA stabilityGenes were assigned to 20 expression bins whose average RSCU values were plotted for the CS data set and all four ICCS data sets for Arabidopsis and rice, representing the eudicots and monocots, respectively (Fig. 5). ICCS RSCU values were not associated with the expression level, suggesting that RSCU variation within coding sequences cannot be explained by the background composition.In Arabidopsis, we observed a positive correlation between gene expression level and the frequency of optimal codons42,43 ending in G|C, mainly for genes assigned to the last few expression bins, underlining the marginal effect of translational selection in this species.42 A more complex scenario emerged in rice, where non-monotonic trends were observed for codons ending in G|C, i.e. a reduction in frequency in the first expression bins changing to an increase in frequency in the last few. This behaviour may be typical of G + C rich monocot genomes and may indicate a compromise between the advantage of using optimal codons and the avoidance of tightly packed mRNA tertiary structures. Indeed a significant negative correlation was found between the expression level and both the coding sequence length and the G + C content of rice genes.44 Taken together, these data suggest that weakly expressed genes are longer and have a lower G + C content at the third codon position than strongly expressed genes. Longer transcripts are more likely to form strongly packed mRNA tertiary structures if they are enriched in optimal codons ending in G|C, so the accumulation of such codons may be counterselected in genes expressed at low or moderate levels. Such a trend would diminish in shorter genes expressed at high levels. This hypothesis was confirmed by analysing HGC and LGC rice genes separately. We found that short HGC genes were generally characterized by a monotonic positive association between the expression level and the frequency of optimal codons ending in G|C.4.5. Additional factorsTAMB is a well-known DNA repair system that influences the composition of primary transcripts (both exons and introns) by increasing the prevalence of G|T over C|A. Despite this general G + C enrichment, we observed the enrichment of four-fold degenerate codons ending in T, suggesting that TAMB may affect codon bias in Arabidopsis and rice, so we repeated our analysis using introns rather than intergenic DNA as an index of background composition. However, we found no differences in the frequency of codons ending in T when we used introns rather than intergenic DNA (Supplementary Fig. S9).The increasing G + C content of plant genomes may have been driven by G + C-biased gene conversion (gBGC) during double-strand break repair followed by a recombination event.45 This phenomenon is accompanied by the correction of eventual mismatches between two paired DNA strands featuring high-sequence similarity, with such a correction being biased towards the placement of either G or C. Given that gBGC is not restricted to genes, the differences in codon bias between the CS and ICCS data sets would not highlight gBGC events. However, synonymous substitutions caused by gBGC are more likely to be fixed in the coding sequence, because codons ending in G|C are known to mirror the most abundant tRNAs in most plant species. There is also evidence that recombination in plant genomes occurs mainly within genes.46Our data provided several lines of evidence supporting the occurrence of gBGC in plants. Indeed if gBGC rather than selection is considered to be the main source of G|C enrichment at the third codon position, such an effect should be evident in all the transcripts regardless of the expression level. As shown in Fig. 5, this was the case for the majority of the codons and expression bins in both Arabidopsis and rice, with the latter featuring wider divergence from the background in accordance with previous reports of gBGC in grasses.47FundingWe would like to thank the Università di Sassari for funding.

IntroductionCalcium signal transduction through calcium conducting channels is an indispensable mechanism utilized by plants to sense and respond to internal and environmental stimuli,1–3 and is involved in various biological processes such as hormone responses,4 development,5 light signalling,6 salt stress7 and plant–pathogen interaction.8 The cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs) are suggested to be one of the important pathways for conducting Ca2+ ions in signal transduction.9 They are ligand-gated, Ca2+-permeable divalent cation-selective channels that are localized in plasma membrane, presumptively are activated by direct binding of cyclic nucleotides and are inhibited by binding of calmodulin (CaM) to the CaM binding (CaMB) domain.10–15 Plant CNGCs are composed of six transmembrane domains (S1–S6) and a pore region (P) between the fifth and sixth domains, C-terminal CaMB domain and cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain.11,16 The CNB domain is highly conserved and carries a plant CNGC-specific motif spanning the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC) and hinge region. This motif identifies CNGCs but no other proteins, hence is recognized as authentic tool to identify plant CNGCs.16,17 The plant CNGC was first identified in a screen for CaMB proteins in barley,18 which was followed by identification in Arabidopsis,19 rice,20,21Populus trichocarpa,22 pear,23Selaginella moellendorffii,16Physcomitrella patens and algae.17,24 The identified 20 Arabidopsis CNGC paralogues were classified into five groups; I, II, III, IVa and IVb.19 To date, the phylogeny and evolution of CNGC gene family in plant remain unclear.Prior studies have shown that many members of Arabidopsis CNGC family are implicated in one or several physiological processes, including Ca2+ signalling, abiotic stress resistance and defence responses.25–30 Several members of Arabidopsis CNGC Groups I–III regulate various functions such as plant development and stress tolerance,25,31 seed germination,32 plant growth,33 pollen fertility under stress,5 pollen tip growth34 and pathogen defence.35,36 However, AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4, members of Group IVb, played their role in disease resistance against various pathogens and in thermotolerance,29,37–44 while AtCNGC19 and AtCNGC20, members of Group IVa, are involved in abiotic salt stress responses.19,45–47 Whether plant CNGC genes are functionally distinguished in a group-dependent manner is not clear. Moreover, in our previous study, we found that group IVb SlCNGC genes regulate different types of resistances against a wide range of pathogens in tomato, and Group IVa CNGC genes of both Arabidopsis and tomato were distinct to those of all other groups in gene structure and CNGC-specific motifs.48 Whether this is also the case in other plant species await confirmation.In this study, we identified CNGC gene family in 15 plant species whose genome has been sequenced at the genome-wide level using comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. Our sequence and phylogenetic data based on 412 CNGC genes from 20 plant species at various positions of evolution revealed for the first time the phylogeny of CNGCs in plant. We also provided evidence that CNGC genes of Group IVa are distinct to those of other groups in gene structure, but function of plant CNGCs is not group dependent.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of CNGC proteins in plant genomesBLASTP searches were performed against sequenced genomes of green plants in Phytozome (v9.1) (http://www.phytozome.net/) and in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases using Arabidopsis and tomato CNGC proteins as queries. Meanwhile, NCBI database searching for sequences containing a plant CNGC-specific motif [LI]-X(2)-[GS]-X-[FYIVS]-X-GX(0,1)-[DE]-LL-X(8,25)-S-X(10)-E-X-F-X-[IL]17 was conducted as well. All retrieved non-redundant sequences were collected and subjected to domain analysis by using the SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) and Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi/) programmes. These sequences were compared with Arabidopsis and tomato CNGC proteins using ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) with default settings and were viewed by GeneDoc program.49 Those containing both a CNB domain [CNBD, cNMP (IPR000595)] and a transmembrane (TM) or ion transport protein (ITP) domain [Ion_trans family (PF00520)] and a plant CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region within the CNBD were recognized as CNGC proteins. CNGCs in a given species were named in accordance with sequence similarity to Arabidopsis CNGCs in phylogenetic relationship.2.2. Gene structure, motif and phylogenetic analysesThe exon/intron structure of CNGC genes was analysed online using the Gene Structure Display Server (GSDS) (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/). The sequence logos were generated online at logo platform (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/). The CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region within the CNB domain of all representative plant species were derived after alignment with MEGA 5.050 and viewed by GeneDoc.49 For phylogenetic tree construction, multiple sequence alignments of CNGC proteins from representative plant species were assembled using clustalX 2.01 program.51 The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 5.050 with maximum likelihood method and bootstrap of 1000.2.3. Plant material and disease resistance analysisTomato (cv. Money maker) plants were grown in growth room at 28°C with16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. For disease resistance evaluation analyses, tomato plants were inoculated with a variety of pathogens. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Ss) was grown at 22°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium for 2 days. The PDA plugs of 3 mm at diameter were taken from the colony outside circle that contained most active young mycelia and then were stuck mycelial side down onto the tomato leaves. The inoculated plants were grown under high relative humidity for 24 h. Lesion size was recorded at 30 h post-inoculation. Inoculation and subsequent disease evaluation for bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) were performed as described.52,532.4. Virus-induced gene silencing analysesThe SlCNGC gene members are highly conserved among each other. Therefore, care was taken to ensure the specificity to target the SlCNGC genes. The virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) target fragments of SlCNGC1, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14 and 15 were amplified by RT-PCR with gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) and ligated into the TRV VIGS vector pYL156, which was subsequently electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 for VIGS analyses. VIGS analyses were conducted with vacuum infiltration delivery approach as described54,55 except that recombinant pYL156 with insertion of an eGFP fragment instead of an empty pYL156 was used as control to alleviate viral symptom.56 At ~3 weeks post agro-infiltration, plants were inoculated with different pathogens and disease was investigated as described above. For each pathogen, at least six silenced plants were examined. The experiments were conducted three times independently.2.5. Drought and salinity stress tolerance assays of VIGS plantsThe plants for both treatments were kept in same condition described above. Ten plants were used for each treatment. Pictures were taken to record the phenotypes. The experiments were conducted three times independently.3. Results3.1. Identification of CNGC protein sequences in 15 flowering plant speciesFifteen flowering plant species whose genome has been completely sequenced and locate at different evolutional positions were selected for CNGC gene family identification analyses. These species included three monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor) and 12 eudicots (Aquilegia coerulea, Solanum tuberosum, Eucalyptus grandis, Citrus sinensis, Gossypium raimondii, Brassica rapa, Malus domestica, Cucumis sativus, Glycine max, P. trichocarpa, Linum usitatissimum and Ricinus communis) (Fig. 1). To identify CNGC protein sequences in these species, the amino acid (aa) sequence of 20 Arabidopsis and 18 tomato CNGCs were used as the query to BLASTP search the plant genome databases at Phytozome (v9.1) and NCBI. Additionally, NCBI database was also searched for sequences carrying a plant CNGC-specific motif [LI]-X(2)-[GS]-X-[FYIVS]-X-GX(0,1)-[DE]-LL-X(8,25)-S-X(10)-E-X-F-X-[IL].17 Consequently, 428 non-redundant putative CNGC gene sequences were retrieved, which were further analysed using SMART and CDD programs to confirm the presence of a cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain [cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate binding (cNMP) domain in SMART, or Cap family effector (CAP_ED) domain in CDD] and a transmembrane (TM) domain (TM domain in SMART or ITP domain in CDD). Subsequently, the candidate sequences were examined for existence of plant CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region within CNB domain.16,17 Finally, of a total of 428 retrieved sequences, 329 were full-length sequences containing both required domains and a CNGC-specific motif and thus were recognized as plant CNGCs. Ninety-one sequences had either no CNGC-specific motif or truncated and hence were discarded. The remaining four pair sequences, including two pairs of Z. mays sequences GRMZM2G169788_T01 and GRMZM2G129375_T01, GRMZM2G161800_T01 and GRMZM2G141642_T01, one pair of C. sinensis sequences orange1.1g045215 m and orange1.1g045637 m and one pair of C. sativus sequences Cucsa.026900.1 and Cucsa.194600.1 were incorrectly separated during annotation and thus were corrected into four complete CNGC genes, which hereafter were designated as ZmCNGC1, ZmCNGC8, CsCNGC15 and CusCNGC16 (Supplementary Table S1). Together, 333 CNGC genes were identified in the listed 15 flowering plant species (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S2). We assigned names of all individual CNGC members in given species in ascending order in accordance with group numbers on the basis of phylogenetic relationship with 20 Arabidopsis CNGCs (Supplementary Table S2). Phylogenetic relationships between the 15 plant species investigated in this study. The total number of CNGC proteins and that of each groups identified in each plant genome is indicated on the right. The phylogenetic tree is modified from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/).

The total number of CNGC proteins and that of each groups identified in each plant genome is indicated on the right. The phylogenetic tree is modified from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/). This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.Composition of CNGC genes in different plant species varied significantly. All three investigated monocots contained <16 CNGC genes, which is similar to what was reported for monocot rice.20,21 However, 10 out of total 12 analysed dicots comprised at least 18 CNGC genes and half of them consisted of over 28 CNGC genes. Among them, M. domestica, G. max and E. grandis bore the most CNGC genes, 44, 35 and 31, respectively (Fig. 1). Additionally, size of different groups within an individual species was distinguishable. Group IVa was the smallest, mostly containing only one or two gene members, whereas Group III and/or Group I were the largest. Uneven group expansion was evident especially in some species. For example, 23 of total 44 (52%) CNGC genes in M. domestica belonged to Group I, while 15 of total 29 (52%) and 15 of total 31 (48%) CNGC genes in L. usitatissimum and E. grandis belonged to Group III. Similarly, G. max and E. grandis contained extraordinarily more (8) group IVa CNGC genes (Fig. 1).3.2. Domain composition and conserved motif at the PBC and hinge region of CNB domain of CNGC proteins in plantsPlant CNGCs comprise a TM/ITP domain and a CNB domain with an overlapped calmodulin-binding (CaMB) domain.11 However, our domain composition analyses using databases SMART and NCBI-CDD revealed that putative plant CNGC proteins were not only characterized by these well-known domains but also contained other domains in some plant CNGC proteins (Supplementary Table S2). For instance, the CDD database search unveiled that M. domestica CNGCs MdCNGC7 and MdCNGC24, two Group I CNGCs, contained DUF2213 (cl19842) and DUF616 (pfam04765) domains, whose function is still unknown. MdCNGC27, a Group II CNGC, carried a LPLATA_GPAT-like domain (cd07989), which is involved in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. MdCNGC41, a Group IVb CNGC, possessed two other domains, a PTEN_C2 (C2 domain of PTEN tumour-suppressor protein) domain (pfam10409) and a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain (cl21483), whereas RcCNGC3, a Group II CNGC, carried a STKc_MAPKKK (Serine/Threonine Kinase, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) domain (cl06606) (Supplementary Table S2). Due to existence of these extra domains, the size of these CNGC proteins was larger than 1000 aa. Nevertheless, whether these domains are indeed functional awaits further experimental confirmation.It has been suggested that plant CNGC proteins carry a CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region within CNB domain.16,17 To confirm whether this motif generally exists in CNGCs of all plant species, we aligned the PBC and hinge region of total 412 CNGC proteins, including 333 from 15 flowering plant species identified in this study and 18 from tomato48 as well as 61 from Arabidopsis, rice, S. moellendorffii and P. patens that were previously identified by other labs.16,17,19 Based on conservation of amino acids at >90%, the motif was deduced as: [L]-X(0,1,2)-[G]-X(3)-G-X(0,1,2)-[E]-L-[L]-X-[W]-X-[L]-X(7,37)-[S]-X(10,11)-[E]-[A]-[F]-X-[L], which was derived from the all-possibility motif: [LIMV0]-X(2)-[GSANCR]-X-[FVIYASCL]-X-G-X(0,1)-X(0,1)-[EDAQGH]-L-[LIVFA]-X-[WRCMLS0]-X-[LMSIQAFT0] -X(7,37)-[SAC]-X(9)-[VTIALMS]-X(0,1)-[EQDN]-[AGSVT]-[FYL]-X-[LIVF], which recognized all 412 plant CNGC proteins identified so far. Notably, this motif contained two invariable amino acids G and L in the PBC. Comparison of this motif with the one suggested earlier, [LI]-X(2)-[GS]-X-[VFIYS]-X-G-X(0,1)-[DE]-L-[LI]-X-[WN]-X(6,32)-[SA]-X(9)-[VTI]-[EN]-[AG]-F-X-[LI],17 demonstrated that the motif suggested earlier for several plant species17 is not applicable to all identified plant CNGCs. Except the two invariable amino acids G and L in the PBC, all the remaining positions of the motif had more possibilities than suggested, including the position suggested as invariable F in the hinge region (Supplementary Fig. S1). This F amino acid was replaced by Y in EgCNGC8/9 of Group III and CsCNGC23 of Group IVb while by L in GmCNGC28 of Group IVa (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that it is necessary to relax the motif suggested earlier17 to the one identified in this study when it is used for identification of plant CNGC.Furthermore, the CNGC-specific motif for each group was generated. They were [LIV0]-X(2)-[GSNR]-X-[FIYVCL]-X-G-X(0,1)-[EDNKA0]-L-X(2)-[WRCS0]-X(7,22)-[PS]-X-[SC]-X(9)-[VIM]-[EQD]-X-F-X[LIVF] for group I; L-[KQVR]-[ED]-X-[DSAE]-FCG-X-ELLTWALDP-[KR]-X(5)-P-X-S-[TS]-RT-[VA]-X-A-X(2)-EVE-[ASG]-F-[AS]-L for group II; [LIM]-X(2)-[GSCN]-X-F-[CAS]-G-[ED]-ELL-X-W-[AVCTS]-[LI]-X-(7,13)-P-X-S-[TS]-[RQCS]-[TS]-[VALG]-X(4)-[ET]-[VLT]-X(0,1)-[ASG]-[FY]-X-[LF] for group III; L-X-[EDK]-[GR]-X(2)-[CYF]-GEEL-[LIF]-X-W-X-[LFQ0]-[ED]-X(1,2)-[SPA]-[SAL]-X(2,20)-[DGV]-X(11,16)-R-X-[VI]-X-C-X-[TS]-NV-[ED]-[AS]-[FL]-X-[LI] for group IVa, and [LI]-X(2)-G-X-[FY]-X-GDELLSWCLR-[RKQ]-[PS]-F-X(2)-R-[LR]-P-X-S-[STA]-X-[TGS]-X(4)-[ED]-X(2)-[EQ]-[AVG]-[FY]-X-L for Group IVb (Fig. 2). The group-wise PBC and hinge motif analysis revealed that the conservativeness of CNGC sequences was obviously different among the groups. Those of the Groups II and IVb were most conserved while those of the Group I least (Fig. 2). Notably, CNGCs of the Group IVa possessed more amino acids with an average of 52 than those of all other groups, which contained averagely 42 (Fig. 2). The difference existed in the middle portion between PBC and hinge region, which were averagely 26 aa in Group IVa while only 15–17 aa in other groups (Supplementary Fig. S2). To further show the conservativeness and relative frequency of amino acid in each position of the PBC and hinge region of CNGCs belonging to each group, we performed group-wise sequence logo motif analysis. The deduced sequence logos displayed that CNGCs of Groups I, II and III were conserved among each other with differences mainly in the positions 2, 3, 17, 19, 21, 22, 26 and 32. While CNGCs of Groups IVa and IVb were much less conserved with those of the other three groups. CNGCs of group IVa contained 10 extra amino acids in the middle in comparison with the others. Besides, there was also some difference in other positions. Significantly, CNGCs of Group IVb variated in 22 positions of a total of 42 amino acids, including positions 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17–23, 29, 31–33, 35–37 and 41, compared with those of other groups (Fig. 3). These data reveal that CNGCs of Groups IVa and IVb are apparently discrete from those of other groups. The group-wise alignment of CNGC-specific motif spanning the PBC and hinge region within CNB domain of plant CNGC proteins identified in this study.

Gene structural analysis reveals the uniqueness of Group IVa CNGC genesTo understand the possible gene structural relationship among CNGC orthologues and paralogues, the exon/intron structure of individual CNGC genes identified from 15 flowering plant species were analysed using GSDS software.58 Intron numbers of these genes varied from 0 to 15, with wide divergence. Notably, the Group IVa CNGCs had distinct gene structures to those of all other groups, with more introns at different phases and lengths. The number of introns in Group IVa CNGCs ranged from 9 (ZmCNGC8, BrCNGC22 and MdCNGC38) to 15 (MdCNGC39) and dominated with 11 (57%) or 10 (24%), which were obviously different from that in the other groups. Group I CNGCs contained introns ranged from 3 (ZmCNGC1) to 12 (LuCNGC1 and LuCNGC2) and dominated with 6 (49%) or 7 (22%); Group II CNGCs carried introns ranged from 0 (6 genes) to 13 (MdCNGC24) with the majority being 6 (60%); Group III CNGC genes had introns of 1 (PtCNGC10) to 11 (MdCNGC30) with mostly being 6 (49%) or 5 (32%), while Group IVb CNGC genes constituted introns of 3 (ZmCNGC11) to 9 (MdCNGC41) mainly of 6 (51%) or 7 (30%) (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Tables S2 and S3). To better understand the phylogeny of gene structure of plant CNGCs, we also analysed the gene structure for CNGC genes from a vascular non-flowering plant (lycophyte) S. moellendorffii and a non-vascular plant (moss) P. patens.12,13 Remarkably, the moss only contained Group IVa and IVb CNGCs and the lycophyte carried Groups I and II besides Groups IVa and IVb CNGCs (Refer to Section 3.4. for detail, Fig. 4). Intriguingly, one moss Group IVa CNGC genes, PpCNGCg, consisted of 12 introns, and all two lycophyte Group IVa CNGC genes (TRD8QYM9 SELML, TRD8RB40 SELML) contained 12 and 11 introns, respectively, as observed for other Group IVa genes in 15 flowering plant species (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the remaining genes of both moss and Selaginella had only 4 to 8 introns (Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, introns of Group IVa CNGC genes had distinct phase profile to other group genes. Except MdCNGC36, all Group IVa genes possessed all of three intron phases; 2, 1 and 0 while introns of the majority of other group genes had no phase 1. The intron of the majority Group IVa CNGC genes had the unique phase pattern 0-0-0-0-0-0-2-2-0-1-2 (52%) for 11-intron genes and 0-0-0-0-0-0-2-2-0-1 (14%) for 10-intron genes, which were mainly present in B. rapa. The only exception is those in M. domestica. Additionally, although CNGC genes of Group IVb and those of the other groups contain similar number of introns, their phase patterns differed. For 6-intron genes, those from Group IVb especially from eudicots exhibited a phase pattern of 0-0-2-0-0-0 (34%) while those from the Groups I, II and III had a 2-0-0-2-0-0 phase pattern (30, 56 and 36%, respectively). While for 7-intron genes, those from Group IVb showed a 2-0-0-2-0-0-0 phase pattern (19%) while those from Group I displayed a 2-0-0-2-0-0-2 phase pattern (9%) (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, most of Group IVa genes had larger gene size probably due to containing more introns in comparison with genes of other groups within the same species (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S3). These data clearly showed that the CNGC genes of Groups IVa and IVb especially Group IVa are distinct in gene structure to those of other groups. Phylogenetic tree of the plant CNGC families. The tree was constructed for 412 CNGC proteins including 333 from 15 plant species identified in this study, 20 in Arabidopsis,19 18 in tomato,48 28 in rice, 5 in S. moellendorffii and 8 in P. patens.16,17 The tree was created using ClustalX program by maximum likelihood (ML) method with bootstrap of 1000 in MEGA5. Groups were indicated. The plant lineages are shown in different shapes and colours; moss in aqua triangle, lycophyte in green circle, monocots in red square and eudicots in blue diamond.Phylogenetic tree of the plant CNGC families.

The phylogeny of plant CNGC proteinsTo elucidate the evolutionary history of the plant CNGC proteins, we comprehensively analysed the phylogeny of all identified 412 CNGCs in plant to date. We constructed maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the CNGC proteins, which included 333 from 15 flowering plant species identified in this study, 20 in Arabidopsis,19 18 in tomato,48 28 in rice, 8 in P. patens and 5 in S. moellendorffii.16,17 Based on the phylogenetic tree, plant CNGC proteins clustered into five groups, named as Groups I, II, III, IVa and IVb with significant bootstrap values (Fig. 4) which is in accordance with what was reported for Arabidopsis CNGCs.19 CNGCs of the 18 flowering higher plant species including both monocots and eudicots separated into five groups. However, markedly, all 8 CNGCs from the non-vascular land plant P. patens clustered only with Groups IVa and IVb. Among the five CNGCs of lower vascular (non-flowering) plant S. moellendorffii, two and one gathered in the Group IVa and IVb, respectively, while the remaining two formed a sister clade with Groups I and II CNGCs of flowering plant species (Fig. 4). This result suggests that during evolution Group IV CNGC genes emerged the earliest among all CNGCs in green plants; Group I and II CNGCs appeared later in vascular plants and Group III CNGCs are likely the most recently evolved in flowering plants.Additionally, the groups were remarkably of unequal size. Group III is the largest one with 132 genes, including 106 from eudicots and 26 from monocots. Group I was the second largest group. It was composed of 102 genes including 92 from eudicots and 10 from monocots. In contrast, Groups II, IVa and IVb were only constituted of 63, 56 and 59 genes, respectively, which was significantly less than Groups III and I (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that plant CNGC gene family expansion event occurred unequally in a group-dependent manner during evolution.3.5. Silencing of the unique tomato Group IVa CNGC gene SlCNGC15 reduces drought resistance but does not affect resistance to a variety of pathogens in tomatoAs described above, the CNGC genes of Groups IVa are ancient and distinct in gene structure as well as CNGC motif in PBC and hinge region within CNB domain to those of other groups. To understand whether genes of this group are also functionally distinguished from those of the other groups, we analysed the function of the unique Group IVa gene in tomato, SlCNGC15, in biotic and abiotic stress resistance using VIGS technique and compared it with that of Group IVb SlCNGC genes, which have been known to regulate a wide range of resistance in tomato including negatively regulating resistance to fungal pathogens Pythium aphanidermatum and S. sclerotiorum and positively regulating resistance to viral pathogen Tobacco rattle virus, flg22-triggered PTI (PAMP-triggered immunity) and Pep1-triggered DPI (DAMP-triggered immunity).48 A 331 bp fragment of the SlCNGC15 gene, which is specific in this gene was amplified through RT-PCR, and cloned into the TRV silencing vector pYL156 for silencing analyses, while non-silenced eGFP fragment-inserted recombinant pYL156 vector was used as a negative control.56 RT-PCR results showed that transcripts of SlCNGC15 accumulated only 19% of those of the eGFP-control (Fig. 5A), indicating that SlCNGC15 was efficiently silenced. Functions of the Group IVa gene SlCNGC15 in disease resistance and abiotic stress responses revealed by VIGS analyses. (A) Silencing efficiency analysis. Plants infiltrated with Agrobacterium suspensions carrying an eGFP-control vector served as control plants.

The experiments were conducted three times independently. Values represent mean ± SD (n = 3).To probe function of SlCNGC15 in disease resistance, the silenced tomato plants were inoculated with a set of different types of pathogens as biotic stresses. We inspected various non-host and host pathogens, including bacterial pathogens P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) and X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and a fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum. Resistance to both non-host pathogen Xoo and host pathogen Pst DC3000 in the SlCNGC15-silenced tomato plants was similar to that in the eGFP-control plants, as both plants developed clear hypersensitive response and necrosis symptoms with similar severity in infiltrated areas at 14 and 48 hpi, respectively (Fig. 5B and C). Resistance to host pathogen S. sclerotiorum in the SlCNGC15-silenced tomato plants was also similar to that in the eGFP-control plants. Necrotic symptoms of the leaves of the SlCNGC15-silenced plants and the eGFP-control plants were similar (Fig. 5D). The size of lesions in the SlCNGC15-silenced plants was 1.12 cm in diameter on average, while that in the eGFP-control plants was 1.15 cm in diameter at 30 hpi (Fig. 5D). This is in contrast with the function of Group IVb genes SlCNGC16, SlCNGC17 and SlCNGC18, which negatively regulate tomato resistance to this necrotrophic pathogen.48The observation that SlCNGC15 does not play a role in resistance to a variety of pathogens prompts us to examine whether this gene is involved in abiotic stress tolerance. To this aim, role of this gene in drought and salt tolerance was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5E, the leaves of the SlCNGC15-silenced plants showed obvious desiccation symptoms at 3 days after stopping watering, including leaf rolling and wilting, while the eGFP-control plants did not show any obvious desiccation symptom. At 4 days after drought treatment, the SlCNGC15-silenced plants only exhibited slight wilting symptoms in upper leaves, while the whole eGFP-control plants had completely wilted. To verify this stress tolerance phenotype in the silenced plants, we further comparatively measured the RWC and chlorophyll content of the SlCNGC15-silenced and the eGFP-control plants under drought stress conditions. The RWC in the eGFP-control plants decreased to ~86 and 64% at 3 and 4 days post drought treatment, respectively. However, that in the SlCNGC15-silenced plants significantly dropped to ~68 and 52% at 3 and 4 days post drought treatment, respectively (Fig. 5E), demonstrating that the SlCNGC15-silenced plants lost more water than the eGFP-control plants. Similarly, higher reduction of chlorophyll was observed in the SlCNGC15-silenced plants than in the eGFP-control plants after drought treatment (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results indicate that the Group IVa gene SlCNGC15 plays a role in drought tolerance in tomato. Similar analyses were conducted to probe the role of SlCNGC15 in salinity tolerance. The SlCNGC15-silenced and eGFP-control plants displayed similar severity of symptoms after salinity treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating that SlCNGC15 might be not required for salinity tolerance in tomato.3.6. Silencing analyses of other group SlCNGC genes do not reveal group-specific function in disease resistance and abiotic stress response in tomatoThe above finding that Group IVa and Group IVb SlCNGC genes play different roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses prompts us to investigate whether CNGCs function in a group-dependent manner. To address this hypothesis, two members per group, SlCNGC1 and SlCNGC6 of Group I, SlCNGC7 and SlCNGC8 of Group II and SlCNGC11 and SlCNGC14 of Group III, were selected for comparative functional analyses by VIGS. RT-PCR results showed that transcripts of the six SlCNGC genes accumulated only lower than 25% of those of eGFP-control (Fig. 6A), indicating that the SlCNGC genes were efficiently silenced. SlCNGC1- and SlCNGC11-silenced plants displayed retarded growth, while plants in which the other four SlCNGC genes were silenced showed normal growth as the eGFP-control plants (Supplementary Fig. S5). Functions of six Group I–III SlCNGC genes in disease resistance and abiotic stress responses revealed by VIGS analyses. (A) Silencing efficiency analysis. Plants infiltrated with Agrobacterium suspensions carrying an eGFP-control vector served as control plants. Accumulation level of SlCNGC transcript in VIGS-treated plants and the eGFP-control plants was detected by qRT-PCR analyses. (B) Xoo-induced hypersensitive response. Photographs were taken at 14 hpi. (C) Sclerotinia sclerotiorum caused necrosis symptoms. Photographs were taken at 24 hpi. Lesion diameter was measured and statistically analysed for all plants. Significant difference between lesion diameter of the silenced plants and that of the eGFP-control plants is indicated as small letters (P < 0.05, DMRT). (D) Salt stress response.

The experiments were conducted three times independently. Values represent mean ± SD (n = 3).To compare function of these SlCNGC genes in disease resistance, the silenced tomato plants were inoculated with bacterial pathogen Xoo and fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum. SlCNGC1-, SlCNGC8-, SlCNGC11- and SlCNGC14-silenced plants developed much stronger hypersensitive necrosis at 14 hpi compared with the eGFP-control plants, while SlCNGC6- and SlCNGC7-silenced plants formed similar hypersensitive necrosis to the eGFP-control plants (Fig. 6B). This result indicated that SlCNGC1, SlCNGC8, SlCNGC11 and SlCNGC14 may play a negative role in tomato non-host resistance to Xoo. SlCNGC1- and SlCNGC6-silenced plants displayed more severe necrotic symptoms with statistically significant larger lesions compared with the eGFP-control plants, while plants in which the other four SlCNGC genes were silenced did not show statistically significant difference in lesion size compared with the eGFP-control plants (Fig. 6C). This result demonstrated that SlCNGC1 and SlCNGC6 might play a positive role in tomato resistance to S. sclerotiorum. Together, these results suggest that function of SlCNGC genes in disease resistance is not correlated with the group that they are belonging to.To compare function of these SlCNGC genes in abiotic stress responses, the silenced tomato plants were examined for their role in salt and drought tolerance. Regarding salt tolerance, compared with the eGFP-control plants, SlCNGC6-silenced plants exhibited more severe symptoms, SlCNGC1-, SlCNGC8- and SlCNGC14-silenced plants developed less severe symptoms, while SlCNGC7- and SlCNGC11-silenced plants showed similar symptoms. At 3 days after 0.4 M NaCl supply, SlCNGC8-silenced plants kept normal growth; SlCNGC1- and SlCNGC14-silenced plants only displayed slight wilt in hypocotyls or leaves, SlCNGC7- and SlCNGC11-silenced plants severely wilted, while SlCNGC6-silenced plants completely wilted with all leaves desiccated (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the RWC in SlCNGC8-, SlCNGC1- and SlCNGC14-silenced plant leaves (89.6, 75.1 and 78.7%, respectively) was high; that in SlCNGC7- and SlCNGC11-silenced plant leaves (59.6 and 63.1%) was medium and similar to control (58.3%), while that in SlCNGC6-silenced plant leaves (49.4) was obviously lower than in control (Fig. 6D). This RWC data correlated well with the severity of wilting symptoms in the silenced plants. These results demonstrated that SlCNGC6-silenced plants are more sensitive, while SlCNGC1-, SlCNGC8- and SlCNGC14-silenced plants are more tolerant to high concentration of salt stress, and indicated that SlCNGC6 may play a positive role, while SlCNGC1, SlCNGC8 and SlCNGC14 may play a negative role in salt tolerance in tomato. As for the drought tolerance, at 8 days after drought treatment, the SlCNGC7- and SlCNGC14-silenced plants remained normal growth without showing obvious wilting symptoms, while SlCNGC1-, SlCNGC6-, SlCNGC8- and SlCNGC11-silenced plants and the eGFP-control plants had severely wilted. The RWC content showed similar trend to the severity of wilting symptoms (Fig. 6E), indicating that SlCNGC7- and SlCNGC14-silenced plants are more tolerant to drought stress and, thus, that these two SlCNGC genes may play a negative role in drought tolerance in tomato.Collectively, these results imply that SlCNGC genes of the same group may play different role while those of different groups may function similarly in biotic and abiotic stress responses, and thus, SlCNGC genes do not function in a group-dependent manner.4. Discussion4.1. CNGC family in plantPlant CNGCs are characterized by the presence of a C-terminal CNB domain as well as an N-terminal hexa-transmembrane (TM) or ITP domain. However, it is noteworthy that the existence of these domains is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition to judge a CNGC protein, since many ion transporters other than CNGCs contain these domains as well. For example, potassium EAG/ERG/KAT channels (Shaker type) contain both a CNB domain and a TM domain.59,60 To address this issue, a plant CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region within CNB domain of CNGC proteins is proposed.16,17 It has been claimed that this motif only exists in plant CNGCs rather not other ion transporters. However, it is validated only in some plant species such as Arabidopsis, rice, a moss P. patens and a lycophyte S. moellendorffii.16,17 Whether this is generally correct in other plant species remains unproved. In this study, we identified 333 CNGCs from 15 flowering plant species. We aligned the PBC and hinge region of 412 CNGC proteins, including these 333 sequences and 18 from tomato48 as well as 61 from Arabidopsis, rice, S. moellendorffii and P. patens that were previously identified by other labs,16,17,19 and consequently generate a motif [LIMV0]-X(2)-[GSANCR]-X-[FVIYASCL]-X-G-X(0,1)-X(0,1)-[EDAQGH]-L-[LIVFA]-X-[WRCMLS0]-X-[LMSIQAFT0]-X(7,37)-[SAC]-X(9)-[VTIALMS]-X(0,1)-[EQDN]-[AGSVT]-[FYL]-X-[LIVF], which recognizes all identified 412 plant CNGC proteins so far. Comparison of our motif with the one suggested for plant CNGCs, [LI]-X(2)-[GS]-X-[VFIYS]-X-G-X(0,1)-[DE]-L-[LI]-X-[WN]-X(6,32)-[SA]-X(9)-[VTI]-[EN]-[AG]-F-X-[LI] by Zelman et al.17 demonstrated that the suggested motif is not applicable to all identified plant CNGCs. Almost all the positions of the motif had more possibilities than suggested, including the position suggested as invariable F in the hinge region (Supplementary Fig. S1). The only exception is the two invariable amino acids G and L in the PBC (Supplementary Fig. S1). Our results provide a more applicable CNGC motif that facilitates identification of plant CNGC.Another finding of this study for plant CNGCs is that the size of CNGC family in different plant species varied significantly and independent of genome size. We observed that generally CNGC family in monocots is smaller than in dicots. All three analysed monocots in this study contain <16 CNGC genes. However, 10 out of 12 dicots under analysis comprise at least 18 CNGC genes and half of them consist of over 28 CNGC genes (Fig. 1). This result indicates independent expansion of CNGC gene members through duplications in distinct dicots lineages since their divergence from monocots. Further, it is obvious that independent genome duplications in Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Brassicaceae and Populus have contributed the increase in dicot CNGC genes compared with monocots, as well as variation in gene copy number across different dicot species. In addition, we scrutinized the structure of all identified plant CNGC genes and found that a total of six CNGC genes do not contain any intron. All these genes belong to Group II. Four of them are from monocots; one is from A. coerulea, a species very close to monocots in evolution (Fig. 1), while the remaining one is from dicot species B. rapa (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, all three monocots under this study contain 1 to 2 intronless gene(s), while only 2 out of 12 dicots under this study carry one such a gene. This observation suggests that gain of introns by monocot intronless CNGC genes may have led to gene recombination and subsequent gene family expansion in dicots after their separation from monocots.4.2. Phylogeny and evolution of CNGC family in plantOne of the aims of this study is to address the evolution of CNGC family in plant. To this end, we first identified CNGCs in single cellular algal species. Our BLASP searches using Arabidopsis and tomato CNGC proteins retrieved 67 sequences from six alga species, including Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Micromonas pusilla RCC299 and CCMP1545, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169, Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Domain analysis revealed that 49 of them contained both CNB and TM/ITP domains (Supplementary Table S5). However, analysis of CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region of CNB domain demonstrated that none of these sequences carried the CNGC-specific motif (Supplementary Table S5). Three CNGC genes were reported in green alga C. reinhardtii.24 However, none of these sequences has a plant-specific CNGC motif as well (Ref. 16 and Supplementary Table S5, this study). Collectively, all retrieved and reported putative CNGC sequences from six algal species do not fit the plant CNGC motif criterion, although they could meet the domain criterion to be identified as CNGC genes. Therefore, probably canonical CNGC does not exist in the single cell species algae. Nevertheless, we successfully identified 333 CNGC genes in 15 higher flowering plant species including 3 monocots and 12 eudicots (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S2). Together with those identified previously in Arabidopsis,19 tomato,48 rice, P. patens and S. moellendorffii,16,17 a total of 412 CNGCs from 20 plant species at various evolutional nodes provide a good platform to analyse the phylogeny and evolution of CNGC family in plant. The ML phylogenetic tree for the 412 CNGCs clearly shows that plant CNGCs cluster into five groups. Strikingly, although CNGC family of each flowering plant species that are under this analysis contain members of all five groups, the non-vascular land plant P. patens only carries members of Groups IVa and IVb, while the lower vascular non-flowering plant S. moellendorffii possesses CNGCs of Groups IVa and IVb and a group of its own sharing a node with Groups I and II of flowering plants (Fig. 4). In other words, P. patens lacks CNGC of Groups I, II and III while S. moellendorffii lacks CNGC of Groups III. This indicates that Group III CNGCs are only present in higher flowering plant species. Collectively, these data reveals that Group IV CNGC genes are the most ancient CNGCs in green plants, and Group I and II CNGCs seem to have followed during evolution of vascular plants, while Group III CNGCs are likely the most recently evolved and their emergence must have been essential during the appearance of flowering plants.4.3. Group IVa CNGC genes are structurally distinct to those of other groupsGroup IVa CNGC genes are highly conserved in all plant species including moss, lycophyte and higher flowering plant species. Although plant species bear different number of Group IVa CNGC genes, most if not all of them in 12 out of 15 flowering plant species under this study contain 11 introns with a pattern of 0-0-0-0-0-0-2-2-0-1-2 except the apple gene MdCNGC36 whose intron pattern is 0-0-0-0-2-0-2-2-0-0-0 (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S3). The remaining three species, maize, cucumber and B. rapa, do not contain any 11-intron Group IVa CNGC gene. BLASTP search in genome sequence of maize and cucumber did not retrieve any full-length Group IVa CNGC gene. However, we found that two successive ORFs coded the N- and C-truncated parts of a putative full-length CNGC protein, respectively. Therefore, we considered the fused sequence of the two truncated ones as a full-length CNGC gene (Supplementary Table S2). Whether these two sequences, ZmCNGC8 and CusCNGC19, are indeed full-length Group IVa CNGC genes awaits further experimental confirmation. Brassica rapa is unique in that although it carries the highest number (8) of Group IVa CNGC genes, none of them contains 11 introns; rather they possess 9–10 introns (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S3). The reason to cause this remains unclear.Group IVa CNGCs differs from those of other groups in many aspects. First, Group IVa CNGCs have larger size of protein compared with other group CNGCs. The average size of full length is 50–70 aa larger in Group IVa CNGCs, compared with other group CNGCs (Supplementary Table S6). It is similar for the PBC and hinge region fragment within CNB domain. It is generally 52 aa in those of Group IVa, which is 10 aa larger than those of other groups (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Second, the CNGC-specific motif of Group IVa CNGCs is different from that of other groups at many positions (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Additionally, the exon/intron gene structure and gene length of group IVa CNGCs are distinct to those of other groups. Group IVa CNGC genes generally contain 10–11 introns with intron pattern of 0-0-0-0-0-0-2-2-0-1-2 for 11-intron genes and 0-0-0-0-0-0-2-2-0-1 for 10-intron genes, while the other group CNGC genes mainly comprise 5–7 introns with no Phase 1 intron (Supplementary Fig. S3). The Group IVa CNGC genes generally have a larger size than those of other groups probably due to carrying more introns. As far as we know, this is the first time to systemically compare the structural characteristics between CNGC genes of Group IVa and those of other groups.4.4. Function of tomato CNGCs in disease resistance and abiotic stress responsesConsidering that Group IVa CNGCs are distinct to those of all other groups in terms of structure as described above, we are interested to make clear whether Group IVa CNGCs are also distinguishable from those of other groups in functions in disease resistance and abiotic stress responses. VIGS analyses indicate that the unique Group IVa CNGC gene in tomato, SlCNGC15, plays an important role in drought tolerance but does not affect resistance to a variety of pathogens including bacterial non-host pathogen Xoo, bacterial host pathogen Pst DC3000 and fungal pathogen S. sclerotiorum (Fig. 5). This is in contrast with the three Group IVb CNGC genes in tomato, SlCNGC16/17/18, which function in resistance to the S. sclerotiorum.48 However, VIGS analyses for six CNGC genes belonging to three other groups demonstrate that function of SlCNGC genes is not correlated with the group that they are belonging to. SlCNGC genes of the same group may play different role while those of different groups may function similarly in biotic and abiotic stress responses. For instance, SlCNGC8 of Group II and SlCNGC14 of Group III may both function in resistance to Xoo and tolerance to salt stress, while SlCNGC7, which belongs to the same group as SlCNGC8, plays no role in these biological processes (Fig. 6). Some SlCNGC genes of other groups such as SlCNGC7 of Group II and SlCNGC14 of Group III may be also involved in drought tolerance as SlCNGC15 of Group IVa (Figs 5 and 6). These results reveal that SlCNGC genes do not function in a group-dependent manner.Our VIGS analyses indicate that the Group IVa gene SlCNGC15 might be not required for salinity tolerance in tomato (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, AtCNGC19 and AtCNGC20, two Group IVa Arabidopsis CNGC genes, were found to be involved in salinity response and could assist the plant to cope with toxic effects caused by salt stress, probably by contributing to a re-allocation of sodium within the plant.46 The reason to cause this discrepancy is unclear. It may reflect the difference in function of CNGC homologues of the same group in different plant species. Alternatively, since plant CNGCs may form heterotetramer as found for animal CNGCs and redundancy may exist among CNGC members, the phenotype of VIGS may be affected by other CNGC genes. Moreover, VIGS only results in knock-down rather not knock-out of SlCNGC15 in tomato (Fig. 5A). Therefore, results from the VIGS analyses await further confirmation using mutants or stable high-efficient RNAi lines. In addition, AtCNGC20 can bind with CaM at its isoleucine glutamine (IQ) motif locating outside of CNB domain.61 Whether SlCNGC15 and even other SlCNGCs contain similar function mechanism is worthy of further study.5. ConclusionA total of 333 CNGC genes from 15 plant species were identified using bioinformatics approaches based on the presence of a CNB domain and a transmembrane pore-forming domain as well as a plant CNGC-specific motif spanning the PBC and hinge region within CNB domain of CNGC proteins. Eight loci for ZmCNGC1, ZmCNGC8, CsCNGC15 and CusCNGC16 that were misannotated at Phytozome database were corrected. We also modified the CNGC-specific stringent motif as [LIMV0]-X(2)-[GSANCR]-X-[FVIYASCL]-X-G-X(0,1)-X(0,1)-[EDAQGH]-L-[LIVFA]-X-[WRCMLS0]-X-[LMSIQAFT0]-X(7,37)-[SAC]-X(9)-[VTIALMS]-X(0,1)-[EQDN]-[AGSVT]-[FYL]-X-[LIVF] to be applicable to all 412 CNGCs from 20 plant species that were identified in this study and by other labs so far. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Group IV CNGCs were the first to arise from the last common ancestors of all green plants, while Groups I and II seem to have evolved later along with appearance of vascular plants with subsequent divergence of Group III CNGCs in flowering plants. Expansion and diversification of CNGC genes into various groups most probably occurred independently in distinct plant lineages. Significantly, we discover that CNGCs of Group IVa are distinct to those of other groups in many aspects of structure, including protein size, length and CNGC-specific motif in the PBC and hinge region of CNB domain, exon/intron structure especially intron number and phase pattern as well as gene size. Members of different groups of tomato CNGC genes play distinguishable roles in disease resistance and abiotic stress responses. Our results provide insights into the phylogeny and evolution as well as function of plant CNGCs.Conflict of interest statementThe authors have declared that no competing interest exists.FundingThis work was financially supported by grants from the Genetically Modified Organisms Breeding Major Projects (no. 2014ZX0800905B), the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (no. 201103016), the SRFDP (no. 20110101110092) and the Program for New Century 151 Talents of Zhejiang Province.

Its small diploid genome and resistance to environmental stress make sorghum an attractive model for studying the functional genomics of the Saccharinae and other C4 grasses. We analyzed the domain-based functional annotation of the cDNAs using the gene ontology (GO) categories for molecular function to characterize all the genes cloned in the full-length cDNA library of sorghum. The sorghum cDNA library successfully captured a wide range of cDNA-encoded proteins with various functions. To characterize the protein function of newly identified cDNAs, a search of their deduced domains and comparative analyses in the Oryza sativa and Zea mays genomes were carried out. Furthermore, genes on the sense strand corresponding to antisense transcripts were classified based on the GO of molecular function. To add more information about these genes, we have analyzed the expression profiles using RNA-Seq of three tissues (spikelet, seed and stem) during the starch-filling phase. We performed functional analysis of tissue-specific genes and expression analysis of genes of starch biosynthesis enzymes. This functional analysis of sorghum full-length cDNAs and the transcriptome information will facilitate further analysis of the Saccharinae and grass families.1. IntroductionSorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is the most important staple cereal crop for millions of people living in West Africa and India,1 providing food for human consumption and feed grain for livestock. More recently, it has become the focus for industrial applications such as bioethanol production. Not only it is an important cereal crop, but also its small diploid genome (~730 Mb) makes sorghum an attractive model for studying functional genomics of the Saccharinae and other C4 grasses. Sorghum belongs to the Saccharinae subfamily, which includes some of the most efficient biomass accumulators, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus). They use C4 photosynthesis, but there is morphological and genomic variations.2 Sorghum is closely related to sugarcane, maize (Zea mays) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), which have much larger polyploid genomes.3 Sorghum genomic information is useful for further analysis of these plants. In addition, sorghum is a good model for studying plant response to abiotic stress, particularly to drought and high temperature stresses.4 Sorghum's tolerance to such stresses makes it especially important among other grasses. Researching sorghum's genome is valuable to accelerate the discovery of new genes and to understand the function and regulation of genes underlying agronomic or compositional traits. For these reasons, the genome sequence of grain sorghum BTx623 was determined in 2009 by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method.2 The development of genomic resources and comparative genomics of sorghum will accelerate functional analysis of genes and specific properties of grass species.In addition to entire genomic sequences, collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been made to improve knowledge of the sorghum transcriptome. A total of 117,682 ESTs have been obtained from sorghum cDNA libraries prepared from samples under various conditions.5 There are currently over 2 million ESTs of sorghum in Genbank.6 EST data are a valuable resource for making expression catalogues. A partial sequence of a transcript is not reliable for correct gene annotation in the genome sequence or for prediction of the coded protein. Full-length cDNAs contain complete coding sequences as well as the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Consequently, genome-scale collections of full-length cDNAs are important for further analysis of the structure and function of genes and their coding proteins.Over the last decade, microarray-based expression profiling experiments for genome-wide analysis in sorghum have been conducted to examine responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses,7–10 to identify tissue-specific and genotype-specific gene expression patterns,11 and to reveal genetic variation and expression diversity between grain sorghum, BTx623, and sweet sorghum, Keller.12 Grain sorghum is important cereal crop for food and feed, while sweet sorghum has a high biomass yield and sugar content. Both lines originated from the same species, S. bicolor. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing technology has provided a more complete view of gene expression and their networks in sorghum. RNA-Seq technology for expression analysis has been employed in sorghum to examine its response to osmotic stress, abscisic acid (ABA)13 and pathogens,14,15 to identify genes responsible for low nitrogen tolerance16 and to compare analogous transcriptomes with other Poaceae plants.17 The advantage of RNA-Seq is that it provides an accurate assessment of gene expression at various stages and under different conditions, which will allow a more detailed atlas of gene expression in sorghum to be produced and thus enable functional analysis of its genes.We have reported two approaches to accelerate progress in sorghum genomics.18 One was a large-scale collection of full-length cDNAs from S. bicolor BTx623 for further accurate annotation of the sorghum genome, e.g. proper understanding of transcription start sites. We have collected ~40,000 full-length cDNAs and identified new genes and antisense transcripts. The other approach was a genome-wide transcription analysis using RNA-Seq to add information about the expression profiles of our cloned full-length cDNAs. We have reported analysis of the expression profiles of three tissues, the spikelet, the seed and the stem. Furthermore, we have established a web-accessible database, MOROKOSHI (http://sorghum.riken.jp).18 In this database, full-length cDNAs and our original RNA-Seq data, as well as publicly available sorghum RNA-Seq data, can be shown on a genome browser together.In this study, we performed functional analysis of genes cloned in our full-length cDNA library, including the newly identified genes and antisense transcripts. Furthermore, we performed functional analysis of tissue-specific genes and expression analysis of genes of enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis. This functional analysis of a large-scale collection of full-length cDNAs with genomic and transcriptome information will facilitate the location of functional genes in the Saccharinae and grass families.2. Materials and methods2.1. Functional analysisThe full-length cDNA data of 10,811-non-redundant genes cloned in the normalized sorghum full-length cDNA library18 was used for functional analysis. The library was made from total RNA of soil-grown S. bicolor BTx623 from various aerial tissues including stems, leaves, spikelets and seeds, and at different developmental stages.18The NCBI CDD (conserved domains database) was used to identify functional domains in identified genes.19For sorghum gene ontology (GO) annotation, we used agriGO,20 a GO analysis toolkit for the agricultural research community. To summarize GO functional annotations, we used the GOSlimViewer on the AgBase21 website.2.2. RNA-Seq preparationRNA-Seq libraries were prepared from total RNA of each tissues, spikelet, seed and stem using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol.18 We performed directional RNA-Seq with a HiSeq2000 (Illumina). The read length was 50 bp of single reads and sequence read data were submitted to the DDBJ (PRJDB3281).2.3. Analysis of RNA-Seq dataFor sequence quality control, we used the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). First, we trimmed base pairs with a Phred quality value (QV) of <20 from the 3' end of each sequence and discarded the sequence when it was shorter than 30 bp in length. Next, if >20% of a sequence had a QV of <20 then it was discarded. Sequences that passed these two filters were mapped with TopHat v2.0.11, assembled and compared using Cufflinks v2.2.0.3. Results and discussion3.1. Functional analysis of sorghum genes in association with full-length cDNAsWe have reported the construction of a normalized S. bicolor full-length cDNA library from BTx623 using the biotinylated CAP-trapper method with trehalose-thermoactivated reverse transcriptase23–25 to facilitate the discovery of novel transcription units and to enable accurate structural gene annotation.18To characterize all the genes cloned in the full-length cDNA library, we analyzed the domain-based functional annotation of the cDNAs. The functional motifs or domains were identified from protein predictions and classified using the GO categories for molecular function. GO analysis of genes cloned in the library and other genes annotated in the sorghum genome (Sbicolor_255) reveals that the categories of ‘structural molecule activity’ and ‘translation factor activity, RNA binding’ had high coverage, whereas the categories of ‘chromatin binding’, ‘motor activity’, ‘receptor activity’ and ‘receptor binding’ showed low coverage. Other categories had ~30% coverage (Fig. 1). The sorghum cDNA library successfully captured a wide range of cDNA-encoded proteins with various functions. Furthermore, to confirm whether our full-length cDNAs contain genes expressed in specific conditions, a comparative analysis using genes regulated by osmotic stress and ABA treatment was performed. The transcriptomes of sorghum in response to osmotic stress and ABA have been reported.13 They showed 5,156 DEGs under polyethylene glycol (PEG) or ABA treatment. We used 5,141 DEGs, having eliminated miRNAs, from a total of 5,156 DEGs for the comparative analysis. The results showed that 31.6% genes (1,623 genes out of 5,141 genes) were present in the sorghum full-length cDNA library (Supplementary Fig. S1). This indicates that the library partially captured genes expressed in specific conditions.

The represented data is for the category of molecular function. The labels show the number of genes.To characterize the protein function of newly identified cDNAs, a search of their deduced domains was carried out (Fig. 2). In our full-length cDNA library, we have determined 336 newly identified genes.18 The domains are distributed in most of the criteria with an abundance of transposase domains. A total of 40 (14.7%) newly identified genes contained domains. Myb domains were also present, which suggests some newly identified genes act as transcription factors. A protein kinase domain and a F-box domain were also found. All this suggests that the newly identified genes encode proteins with various functions.

The results are shown in Fig. 3. Using blastn with an e-value =0.001, 49 (14.6%) and 105 (31.3%) homologous genes were found in O. sativa and Z. mays, respectively. Because 39 genes were overlapping with both species, 115 newly identified cDNAs were predicted to be homologous to O. sativa or Z. mays. Of the remaining 221 genes, 186 (55.4%) were non-homologous in an analysis using blastp with an e-value =0.001 against NCBInr, which suggests that they may be unique sorghum genes.

(B) The overlapping matches between species are displayed in the Venn diagram. Sorghum unique shows non-homologous gene in an analysis using blastp with an e-value =0.001 against NCBInr.Natural antisense transcripts control the expression of their sense genes through several mechanisms.26 Many paired sense and antisense transcripts have been identified in several plants, such as Z. mays,27O. sativa28 and Arabidopsis thaliana.29,30 Many of these have been confirmed by means of full-length cDNA mapping onto the genome sequences.28,31 Although the tissue-specific expression of non-coding RNA (ncRNA), such as rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA and microRNA, have been analyzed using microarray analysis,11 a comprehensive analysis of antisense transcripts in sorghum has not been carried out. In our full-length library, we have identified 323 transcripts from antisense strands of known annotated genes.18 To obtain insights into the function of these antisense transcripts, genes on the sense strand corresponding to antisense transcripts were classified based on the GO of molecular function (Supplementary Fig. S2). Using GO Slim, we found that the genes with antisense were widely distributed in the GO categories. The ratios of ‘molecular function’, ‘DNA binding’, ‘transferase activity’ and ‘hydrolase activity’ were higher than all the annotated genes in Sbicolor_255. The results suggest that antisense transcripts play a role in the regulation of sense genes with a wide range of functions.3.2. Expression analysis of newly identified genes and antisense transcriptsWe have reported BTx623's transcriptome during the grain's starch-filling phase.18 We have prepared RNA from spikelets harvested at the anthesis stage and from seeds harvested 15 days after anthesis. As a vegetative tissue control, we prepared RNA from stems harvested at the same time as the spikelets (Supplementary Fig. S3).18We have generated an integrated transcriptome database to access and use our full-length cDNA data together with our RNA-Seq data and other publicly available data (MOROKOSHI; http://sorghum.riken.jp).18To obtain insights into the expression of the newly identified genes and the antisense and sense transcripts, the expression patterns were analyzed in our RNA-Seq data as well as the publicly available sorghum RNA-Seq data13,15–17 in this study. An example of a newly identified gene is shown in Fig. 4A. The gene, 012_K21, showed spikelet-specific expression in our RNA-Seq data and this result was consistent with the analysis of expression in the anther.17 However, it showed expression that was induced by ABA- or PEG stress in the root in other available sorghum RNA-Seq data.13 Co-expression analysis using the same method as database, MOROKOSHI18 showed some transcription factors (e.g. a Zinc finger-type proteins and homologues of RGL1) co-expressed with this newly identified gene, 012_K21. Examples of newly identified antisense transcripts are shown in Fig. 4B. An identified antisense transcript (026_B16) showed high expression in seed and stem, which is consistent with analysis of expression in the early inflorescence and the endosperm.17 In our database, MOROKOSHI,18 co-expression analysis showed some transcription factors (e.g. a AP2 domain-containing transcription factor and a myb family transcription factor) co-expressed with this sense transcript (Sobic.003G28300). The effects of antisense transcripts on the expression of sense transcripts are classified into two groups, concordant regulation and discordant regulation.30 One of the identified antisense transcripts (041_N07) showed concordant expression with a sense gene (Sobic.006G007500). This gene showed expression in the shoot that was induced by ABA or PEG stress.13 The tissue-specific expression of ncRNA, such as rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA and miRNA using microarray analysis has been reported.11 In our RNA-Seq data, we detected the expression of 17 ncRNAs (8 miRNAs, 7 tRNAs, 1 rRNA and 1 snoRNA) out of reported 136 ncRNAs in their analysis11 (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped sequence reads [FPKM] value >0). Expression of these 17 ncRNAs was confirmed on 12 ncRNAs in spikelet, 11 in seed and 13 in stem. Expression of ncRNAs in seed and spikelet suggested that these ncRNAs were activated during the starch-filling phase in grain sorghum.

The plot shows the relative expression (FPKM) of a newly identified gene (A), and sense and antisense transcripts (B) in seed, spikelet and stem from our RNA-Seq data, as well as the publicly available sorghum RNA-Seq data of stressed, infected and tissue-specific samples.13,15–17 Blue lines show sense transcripts and red lines show antisense transcripts.

This figure is available in black and white in print and in colour at DNA Research online.3.3. Analysis of tissue-specific gene expressionWe have reported investigating tissue specificity of genes in three samples by using a cut-off FPKM value form only annotated genes.18 In our analysis, in order to extract only the DEGs that are specifically expressed from genes already annotated as well as newly identified genes, any having an adjusted q-value =0.001 against at least one of the other tissues as well as a FPKM value <1 in both other tissues were included. We identified 570 genes that were spikelet specific, 490 genes were seed specific and 390 genes were stem specific. These tissue-specific genes are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The number of stem-specific genes was lower when compared with those that were spikelet or seed specific. From PlnTFDB (http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/),32 sorghum contains 2312 unique genes of transcription factors. In tissue-specific genes, we found 29 transcription factors in spikelet, 56 transcription factors in seed and 35 transcription factors in stem. This suggested that these many transcription factors contributed the tissue-specific expression. These results suggest that many genes are expressed tissue specifically during the starch-filling phase in grain sorghum.To gain further insight into the functional significance of tissue-specific genes, we set out to determine whether genes of functional categories were expressed specifically in each tissue. GO functional analysis revealed an enrichment of molecular function in each set consistent with known functional differences (Fig. 5). The distribution of the seed-specific genes set was higher for the categories ‘DNA binding’ and ‘hydrolase activity’ than other tissues. The spikelet-specific genes set was higher for ‘molecular function’, ‘lipid binding’ and ‘enzyme regulator activity’, whereas the stem-specific genes set was higher for ‘nucleotide binding’ and ‘binding’. Functional classification based on the GO slim categories of tissue-specific genes. The histogram shows the distribution of genes classified into GO slim categories of specifically expressed genes in each tissue type. Functional annotations are presented in relation to the molecular function.Functional classification based on the GO slim categories of tissue-specific genes. The histogram shows the distribution of genes classified into GO slim categories of specifically expressed genes in each tissue type. Functional annotations are presented in relation to the molecular function.In addition to GO analysis, tissue-specific genes were mapped to terms in the KEGG database22 to identify significantly enriched metabolic or signal transduction pathways. DEGs between spikelet and stem with KEGG annotation were categorized into 16 pathways, DEGs between seed and stem into 9 pathways and DEGs between seed and spikelet into 16 pathways (Supplementary Table S2). DEGs between spikelet and stem associated with biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, starch and sucrose metabolism, carbon metabolism, plant–pathogen interaction and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways were enriched. DEGs between seed and stem associated with biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were enriched. Starch and sucrose metabolism pathways were enriched in both DEGs. The carbon metabolism pathway was enriched in only DEGs between spikelet and stem. Plant hormone signal transduction pathways were enriched in only DEGs between seed and stem. This suggests that these metabolic or signal pathways are activated in each tissue.3.4. Analysis of stably expressed genes and non-expressed genesStably expressed genes will be useful as controls in future expression experiments. We attempted to find such genes in our RNA-Seq data as well as in publicly available RNA-Seq data.13,15–17 We searched for genes with the least variability in expression (coefficient of variation =15%) and found 29. They are shown in Supplementary Table S3. Others have identified 448 stably expressed genes.11 However, because we used RNA-Seq data from samples that had either been under stress or infected, the number of stably expressed genes was reduced.Although we analyzed the gene expression of a diverse range of tissues and conditions in our RNA-Seq data as well as in publicly available data, 654 genes of the annotated genes in Sicolor_255 were not detected (FPKM = 0). The list of genes not expressed is shown in Supplementary Table S4. The lack of detection could be due to an absence of expression in vegetative tissues, under the special conditions or at the stages used in this analysis. Other possibilities are that these genes are false positives, or that their levels of expression are below detection limits.3.5. Expression analysis of genes involved in the sucrose-to-starch pathwayGrain sorghum has high starch content in its grains and this is the main reason for its cultivation as biofuel feed stock. Datta et al.33 examined the expression profiles of some of the genes involved in the sucrose-to-starch pathway at the stage of pollen development. Starch biosynthesis requires the coordination of several enzymes, for which different isozymes have different functions.34 However, only limited information is available in the expression profiles of these genes at the stage of seed development. Analysis of expression of isozymes of starch biosynthesis enzymes has been carried out in the genome-wide transcriptome of maize at this stage.35 The complete genome sequence of sorghum2 and the SorghumCyc, a metabolic pathways database (http://www.gramene.org/pathway/sorghumcyc.html), as well as next-generation sequencing provide a unique opportunity to obtain more precise information about genes and their networks in sorghum. To identify tissue-specific expression patterns, we examined the expression of several known enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis in sorghum. The heat map of expression profiles is shown in Fig. 6. Sucrose synthase (SUS), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), soluble starch synthase (SSS) and starch-branching enzyme (SBE) showed 5, 2, 4 and 6 genes, respectively, in the genome (http://www.gramene.org/pathway/sorghumcyc.html). Three of the six SUS genes showed high expression in spikelets and seeds. These genes, Sobic.001G344500.1; Sobic.001G378300.1; Sobic.010G072300.1, encode the putative orthologs of maize Sus1, Sus2, Shrunken (Sh1), respectively.36,37 The high expression of the ortholog of Sh1 is consistent with a recent study in maize. Sh1 mainly accounted for almost all of the transcripts of SUS in the endosperm of maize.34 Although expression of Sus1 and Sus2 (SuSxy) was not detected at the seed development stage in maize, putative orthologs of Sus1 and Sus2 were detected in developing seeds in sorghum. A putative ortholog of Sus2 (Sobic.001G378300.1) showed a specific expression pattern at this stage. There are different types of SS, GBSS and SSS. Two GBSS genes showed increased expression at seed development. One gene (Sobic.010G022600.1) showed higher expression than the other. This gene encodes the putative ortholog of maize waxy1 (wx1). This is consistent with maize, in which waxy1 is mainly expressed in the endosperm.35 Of the SSS genes, one gene (Sobic.010G047700.1) showed higher expression in seed while another, Sobic.010G047700.2, showed similar expression to the other SSS genes. Three of the SBE genes, Sobic.004G163700.1, Sobic.007G204600.1 and Sobic.010G273800.1, showed higher expression in seeds and Sobic.006G066800.1 showed expression in spikelets, seeds and stems. Sobic.010G273800.1, Sobic.007G204600.1 and Sobic.004G163700.1 encode orthologs of amylose-extender1 (ae1), sugary1 (su1) and starch-branching enzyme1 (sbe1) of maize, respectively.38–40 In Fig. 6, we show expression of stressed, infected and tissue-specific samples from the publicly available sorghum RNA-Seq data.13,15–17 One GBSS gene (Sobic.002G116000.1) showed higher expression than another (Sobic.010G022600.1) in leaf tissues, although Sobic.002G116000.1 was expressed less in seed tissue. This suggests these genes have separate functions depending on the tissue. These results using publicly available RNA-Seq data indicate that isozymes have different expression patterns in different conditions.

Furthermore, we performed genome-wide transcription analysis using RNA-Seq to add information about the expression profiles of our cloned full-length cDNAs. This functional analysis of a large-scale collection of full-length cDNAs with genomic and transcriptome information will facilitate the discovery of functional genes in the Saccharinae and other grass families.4.

IntroductionThe automation of sequencing techniques and the spread of computer use gave rise to a flourishing number of new molecular structures and sequences and to a proliferation of new databases in which to store them.1 The public availability of databases is of inestimable value, because the collective use of data leads to the discovery of new knowledge that goes beyond the results yielded by individual experiments.2The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) is a collection of gene records accessible as web page entries. Among the other existing genome browsers, such as the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) and Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html), NCBI Gene is the most complete, containing information about more than 2 million genes from more than 350 species (eukaryotic genes with nuclear genome annotations; the total is over 11 million genes from almost 13,000 species). It provides information about gene nomenclature, chromosomal localization, gene transcripts and products, as well as a series of useful links to, among other things, sequences, maps, citations, phenotypes, variation details, interactions and external databases.3 As well as browsing the data, a very efficient way of accessing information is by performing a text search. NCBI Gene is a text searchable database through indexed fields using specific term queries (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3841/), although unfortunately not all fields of the database are available for searching.4 Furthermore, NCBI makes some Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utilities) available that can be combined to form customized data pipelines to extract the desired information from NCBI Gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/). The retrieved matching results can be downloaded in different formats: text, abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) and extensible markup language (XML), allowing further analyses on a local computer. Parsers able to transform ASN.1- or XML-formatted NCBI Gene data to a relational database exist. They usually give output information that can only be accessed through the structured query language (SQL) without a graphical interface; and some of them also require high-level programming and querying skills.5–8To address these problems, we have developed GeneBase, a full parser of the NCBI Gene database, which generates a fully structured local and relational database combined with an intuitive user-friendly graphical interface for personal computers. It allows users to do original searches, calculations and analyses of the main information about genes which are fully annotated with the ‘Gene Table’ section in NCBI Gene, i.e. eukaryotic genes. Furthermore, for a subset of gene records, we integrated nucleotide sequences useful for additional elaboration with the corresponding gene-associated meta-information.GeneBase database contains a wealth of interesting biological information, and we provide an original analysis of the classic biological problem of the ‘minimal intron’ (the minimal DNA sequence element that can function as an intron) across all the available species as an example. A limitation in minimum length below which an intron cannot be spliced must exist.9 In the literature, the minimal intron length is usually given as a range, an average or as a length lesser than a certain number, often without a primary reference, accession number or gene name. Short introns were defined as those not longer than 116 base pairs (bp) in Arabidopsis thaliana (Taxonomy Identifier or ID: 3702).10 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Taxonomy ID: 4932), short intron length is =191 bp,11 with an average of 92 ± 20 and 49 ± 11 bp, as in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Taxonomy ID: 4896).12 In Caenorhabditis elegans (Taxonomy ID: 6239), short intron length was on average 51.5 bp,13 and confirmed later with a length of =60 bp,11 with a minimum of 48 bp.10 In Drosophila (Taxonomy ID: 7215), the minimum length is 63 bp,10 but the minimum experimentally verified is 74 bp.14 For mouse and human (Taxonomy IDs: 10088 and 9606, respectively), one of the most recent studies defined the minimal intron length range as between 50 and 150 bp, corresponding to the peak value of the intron length distribution,10,15 in contrast with the length <30 bp in Homo sapiens (Taxonomy ID: 9606) hypothesized by Strachan and Read.16We show that the intron length problem, which still raises researchers' interest,17 may find a solution, regarding all currently available data and canonical introns, through a new tool like GeneBase, which is especially useful for retrieving data with numerical range constraints and with the corresponding gene-associated meta-information. Introns <30 bp were not found in any of the species analysed, shedding light on the minimal sequence requirement elements used by the cell for conventional splicing functioning. Remarkably, the 30 bp size is indeed consistent with the sum of the known 5'/3' splicing consensus sequence lengths.2. Materials and methods2.1. Database constructionGeneBase was developed within the FileMaker Pro Advanced environment (FileMaker, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which has already been proved useful for complex parsing of genomic data.18,19 This is a database management system with an intuitive user-friendly graphical interface for both Macintosh (Mac OS X) and Windows operating systems. Minimum system requirements are: Mac OS X 10.6, Intel-based Mac CPU (Central Processing Unit), 1 GigaByte (GB) of RAM (Random Access Memory), 1024 × 768 or higher resolution video adapter and display; Windows XP Professional, Home Edition (Service Pack 3), 700 MegaHertz (MHz) CPU or faster, 256 MegaBytes (MB) of RAM, 1024 × 768 or higher resolution video adapter and display.The pre-loaded version of GeneBase was obtained by first downloading all the available Animalia (Metazoa, Taxonomy ID: 33208), Fungi (Taxonomy ID: 4751) and Plant (Viridiplantae, Taxonomy ID: 33090) kingdom gene entries from NCBI Gene. Specific text queries were used to fragment the download according to the three kingdoms and to retrieve all current (alive/live) records with a genomic gene source, excluding gene models (generated by annotation pipelines), as described in detail in the GeneBase guide. The initial download was performed on 22 April 2015 choosing the ASN.1 format, as it is the data reference representation format used by NCBI, providing smaller file sizes, fewer errors and complete data, while avoiding problems encountered by the FileMaker Pro XML parsing engine with large data files. We have developed a Python (http://www.python.org/, version 2.7) executable script to quickly parse ASN.1-formatted downloaded gene entries and thus obtain three tab-delimited files suitable for import into the three main related tables of GeneBase (corresponding to NCBI sections): ‘Gene_Summary’, ‘Gene_Table’ and ‘Gene_Ontology’. ‘Gene_Summary’ table contains one record for each gene and collects details such as the official gene symbol, the official gene full name, the organism's name and a brief summary description of the gene and its cellular localization and function (when available). ‘Gene_Table’ consists of one record for each exon including the corresponding intron if an intron follows that exon, representing the exon/intron structure of each transcript isoform as annotated on the indicated genomic Reference Sequence (RefSeq).20 Each record contains details such as RefSeq GenBank accession numbers of chromosome, messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein (when available), and the genomic coordinates of exons and introns. Additional calculation fields were created to extract further data not present in the original NCBI gene entries from the available information and are highlighted in red text. Furthermore, additional boxes were created to show useful related fields of other related software tables, giving the opportunity to perform crossed searches. Different buttons were developed to facilitate navigation through the software tables, the retrieval of features in popular databases and the launch of online BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)21 comparisons. Finally, text fields were specifically designed to contain exon and intron sequences. ‘Gene_Ontology’ table contains the specific Gene Ontology (GO) attributions for each gene when available.22 A specific table named ‘Transcripts’ is available, showing the RefSeq status provided for each gene as well as for each of its individual transcripts. An additional table named ‘Reports’ is generated to provide statistics such as the mean length of exons and introns. In agreement with general criteria in database design, we decided to fragment information into distinct fields as much as possible, to facilitate an independent management of data. All database fields are indexed to ensure efficient data retrieval through the query options.A specific feature of GeneBase is the integration with nucleotide sequences. To achieve this, a Python executable script was developed to extract exon (both coding and not coding) and intron sequences of each entry from any chromosome sequences in FASTA format and, thus, obtain a tab-delimited file suitable for import into GeneBase, if desired (Fig. 1). Flow diagram illustrating the data parsing involved in the GeneBase development. ‘Gene_Summary’, ‘Gene_Table’ and ‘Gene_Ontology’ are the three main related software tables.Flow diagram illustrating the data parsing involved in the GeneBase development. ‘Gene_Summary’, ‘Gene_Table’ and ‘Gene_Ontology’ are the three main related software tables.For the example application that we have presented here, we have selected ‘Gene_Table’ exon/intron records of GeneBase database belonging to genes with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status, whose corresponding RNA has an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ RefSeq accession number, to exclude ‘XM_’ or ‘XR_’ model Refseq records generated by automated pipelines.20 We downloaded the corresponding chromosome sequences from the NCBI Nucleotide database using Batch Entrez (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) in FASTA format on 5 May 2015. Then the tab-delimited file containing the corresponding exon and intron sequences obtained from script parsing was imported into the specific ‘Gene_Table’ fields.We provide here a version of GeneBase pre-loaded with eukaryotic gene data updated on 22 April 2015, along with an empty template that may be used at any time to load ab initio the latest version or any desired subset of NCBI Gene data by any user, following parsing by our scripts. The import of parsed NCBI Gene entries can be performed also using a pre-loaded version of GeneBase without deleting previously imported records, if desired. In any case, we plan to release an updated version of our eukaryote GeneBase each year, for the convenience of users.We made stand-alone software (of both GeneBase pre-loaded and empty versions), including the FileMaker runtime with a user guide included and the relative Python scripts for the initial data pre-processing and sequence calculations, freely available to basic users at http://apollo11.isto.unibo.it/software/. The freely distributed licensed runtime application allows full data import, records export in diverse file formats, as well as full record management and analysis and script execution. The user can also export sequence data contained in GeneBase in an automatically generated FASTA formatted text file, allowing further processing of these data, e.g. their use as a target database by a locally installed version of BLAST. The downloading, parsing and import of gene entries, the downloading of chromosome sequences and the calculation of exon and intron sequences are described in detail in the software documentation.Only for the creation of new fields, further calculation or additional relationship definition an original copy of FileMaker Pro version 12 (or higher) is required.2.2. Example applicationThe fully structured local database obtained (Supplementary Fig. S1) allows users to make many types of comparisons and do a variety of calculations that are useful for data retrieval and analysis.As an example of how to use GeneBase, we have provided an original analysis of the existing introns across all the available species. To define the minimal intron (the minimal known DNA sequence element that can function as an intron), we queried GeneBase for introns of between 1 and 40 bp, considering only genes currently annotated on the most recent genome annotation (excluding records with ‘Genome_Annontation_Status’: ‘not in current annotation release’). Among the retrieved records, we only considered for bioinformatic validation introns belonging to gene entries with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status, with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of corresponding RefSeq RNA accession number and with the canonical splicing sites (GT and AG for donor and acceptor sites, respectively), thus focusing on the conventional splicing mechanism.23 We excluded from the analysis sequences predicted only by annotation of genomic sequence and thus lacking experimental evidence. We used BLASTN, the standard Nucleotide BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?Blast.cgiCMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=References),21 to find at least two independent expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences, or one manually curated RNA sequence, that encompass the intron, as a proof of existence of intron sequences. We queried the chromosome accession of each considered intron, using the previous exon start and the following exon end coordinate range as ‘Query subrange’, limiting the searches to the ‘Nucleotide collection nr/nt’ and then to the ‘Expressed sequence tags (est)’ databases, and to the organism to which the intron sequence belongs. The analysis was carried out in May 2015.The validated intron sequences were studied for the presence of the well-known functionally important sites, e.g. the branch point and the poly-pyrimidine tract, using the following eukaryotic consensus reference sequence: MAGGTRAGT…YNYYRAYY…YYYYYYYYYYYNYCAGG, where M = A/C, R = A/G, Y = C/T, N = any base.16,24Furthermore, the 20 shortest human canonical intron sequences available in GeneBase, with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status and an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of corresponding RefSeq RNA accession number, were analysed for the guanine (G) content.25Where indicated, the number of organisms was calculated by sorting records by organism and then exporting them to generate a summary report of the organisms present in the database.The total number of currently annotated exon, coding exon or intron records, with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status and with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of corresponding RefSeq RNA accession number, were retrieved typing: ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ in the ‘RefSeq_Status’ field of ‘Gene_Table’ table, ‘N*’ in the ‘RefSeq_RNA_Accession’ field, ‘>0’ in the corresponding length fields and omitting entries marked as ‘not in current annotation release’ in the ‘Genome_Annotation_Status’ field. A set of non-redundant intron records can be retrieved typing ‘Yes’ in the ‘Non_Redundant_Intron’ field (Fig. 2). Screen shot of GeneBase ‘Gene_Table’ interface. Fields are described in detail in the software documentation. Exon and coding exon sequences are in distinct fields to allow an independent management of data (see Materials and methods).

Results3.1. Database constructionWe downloaded from NCBI Gene all current (alive/live) eukaryotic records with a genomic gene source (excluding gene models) available up to 22 April 2015. We obtained 679,451 entries for Animalia (Metazoa, Taxonomy ID: 33208), 1,203,082 for Fungi (Taxonomy ID: 4751) and 534,875 for Plants (Viridiplantae, Taxonomy ID: 33090), for a total of 359 organisms. Among the 2,417,408 total gene entries, 76,182 are ‘REVIEWED’, 41,862 ‘VALIDATED’, 2,245,205 ‘PROVISIONAL’, 31,464 ‘INFERRED’, 22,691 ‘PREDICTED’, 1 ‘MODEL’ and 1 ‘WITHDRAWN’ (despite the gene model exclusion performed using the web search described in the GeneBase guide; the remaining two gene entries are not specified).After the initial parsing and importing steps, the three main tables in GeneBase database are constituted as follows: ‘Gene_Summary’ contains 2,417,408 records (one for each NCBI Gene entry), ‘Gene_Table’ (Fig. 2) contains 13,824,965 records (one record for each gene exon, included the corresponding intron if an intron follows that exon) and ‘Gene_Ontology’ contains 149,064 records in all (one for each gene with GO information available). Due to the lack of annotated transcribed products, a gene structure was not available for 86,824 Gene IDs (explaining the presence of ‘Gene_Summary’ gene entries without or with incomplete corresponding ‘Gene_Table’ records, for example Gene ID: 105667210 and Gene ID: 100121140, respectively).Among the total gene entries, 2,368,726 are protein-coding, 25,796 pseudogenes (pseudo), 21,247 non-coding RNA (ncRNA), 527 coding for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), 137 for small nuclear RNA (snRNA), 86 for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 6 for cytoplasmic RNA genes (scRNA) (the remaining are not specified).Then, to integrate nucleotide sequences, from the ‘Gene_Table’ table of our database, we selected 861,550 records with the ‘REVIEWED’ RefSeq status and 534,578 with the ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status (in both cases having an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of RefSeq RNA accession number, to exclude ‘XM_’ or ‘XR_’ model Refseq records generated by automated pipelines) for a total of 1,396,128 exon entries. Using Batch Entrez, we were able to retrieve and download 1,336 records out of the 1,338 corresponding chromosome sequences. This selection gave rise to a total of 1,385,944 ‘Gene_Table’ records, which represent 10% of all available entries, updated with exon, coding exon (for protein-coding genes) and the corresponding downstream intron sequences up to 5 May 2015. The whole database including sequences has a size of 25.1 GB following decompression.3.2. StatisticsIn GeneBase, an additional table named ‘Reports’ is generated to easily provide statistics such as the mean length of exons (both coding and not coding) and introns (Table 1). These values were obtained considering all the available records in the ‘Gene_Table’ table of GeneBase database belonging to gene entries currently annotated on the most recent genome annotation, with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status and with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of the corresponding RefSeq RNA entry accession number. The mean exon length for all organisms is 308 base pairs (bp) with a standard deviation (SD) of 613 (range 1–91,671). In total, 1,252,462 GeneBase records are related to coding exons. The mean coding exon length is 206 bp with a SD of 325 (range 1–27,708). The mean intron length for all organisms is 3,820 bp with a SD of 15,693 (range 1–1,160,411), and the overall intron length distribution is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Other intron length statistics for some representative organisms are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3, considering a non-redundant set. The correlation coefficient between intron and genome lengths among these organisms is 0.957 with a P-value of 5.302e-05 (Supplementary Fig. S4) while, considering Vertebrata (Taxonomy ID: 7742), the correlation coefficient is 0.968 with a P-value of 0.007 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Statistical analysis of exon and intron lengthsThe analysis was carried out considering only ‘Gene_Table’ records belonging to gene entries with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status and with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of corresponding RefSeq RNA accession number, omitting entries marked as ‘not in current annotation release’ in the ‘Genome_Annotation_Status’ field (see Materials and methods). Mean and standard deviation values were obtained from the ‘Reports’ database table calculation fields. Lengths are given in base pairs (bp).aCommon exons and introns belonging to multiple transcript variants are counted multiple times. The existence of intronless genes and the fact that terminal exons are not followed by an intron account for a reduced number of introns in comparison with exons.bMinimum exon and intron length determination is subject to the annotation artifacts described in the text, so only the manually verified data are shown here.Statistical analysis of exon and intron lengthsThe analysis was carried out considering only ‘Gene_Table’ records belonging to gene entries with a ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status and with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of corresponding RefSeq RNA accession number, omitting entries marked as ‘not in current annotation release’ in the ‘Genome_Annotation_Status’ field (see Materials and methods).

Search for the minimal intronWe found 118,942 ‘Gene_Table’ records related to an intron sequence with a length range between 1 and 40 bp (Table 3). Among the entries with ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ RefSeq status, 587 intron records belong to an RNA with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ RefSeq type accession number (Supplementary Table S1). Considering the presence of the canonical GT-AG splicing sites as a prerequisite, a subset of 170 introns was used for the bioinformatic validation of the minimal intron (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Through BLASTN software, we were able to find at least two independent EST sequences, or one manually curated RNA sequence, encompassing the intron as validation of the existence of intron sequences, for 15 introns only (Table 4 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Number of retrieved GeneBase records and corresponding intron lengthsLengths are given in base pairs (bp). The total number of ‘Gene_Table’ records with a currently annotated intron length between 1 and 40 bp is 118,942.

The following validated intron length is 35 bp and belongs to the nAChRb1 gene of Tribolium castaneum (Gene ID: 657999, Taxonomy ID: 7070), encoding for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta-1 subunit. Regarding other organisms, also validated were the 39 bp intron of CELE_B0348.6 gene of C. elegans (Gene ID: 178536, Taxonomy ID: 6239) and the 40 bp intron of bcd gene of Drosophila melanogaster (Gene ID: 40830, Taxonomy ID: 7227), encoding for the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-3 and for bicoid, respectively.The analysis of the validated intron sequences revealed the presence of many conserved bases compared with the well-known consensus sequence (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S3).The G content of the 20 shortest ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ human canonical intron sequences is shown in Supplementary Table S4.4. DiscussionWe have described a full parsing of all eukaryotic gene entries annotated in NCBI Gene and generated a relational and fully indexed local database named GeneBase. It consists of three main related tables containing information—such as gene nomenclature, structure and transcripts—in indexed fields about more than 2 million genes from more than 350 species, ranging from Plants and Fungi to Animals. This compares very favourably to, for example, the 91 species available through the Gene Table download utility provided by UCSC (http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) or the 69 available in Ensembl through the download tool BioMart (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/). The choice we made this time of considering NCBI Gene data, in contrast with our other sequence parsing tools based on UCSC data,26,27 also gave us maximum flexibility in the choice of search parameters. However, the parsing of such a high number of gene entries inevitably needs a considerable amount of disk space and time to perform calculations. We chose not to provide a GeneBase web tool, because FileMaker Pro is particularly useful due to its structure and interface but has limitations for web publication of full features of the local file. In addition, a web version would not be able to give users the freedom to customize the database and apply it to local files. Therefore, along with the eukaryote pre-loaded version of the database (for users interested in all the available entries), we have made an empty version available. It can be loaded by any user by importing subsequent versions or desired subsets of NCBI Gene data downloaded using specific text queries and parsed by our provided scripts, according to the GeneBase guide.Among all the genes that are present in the pre-loaded version of GeneBase (based on NCBI Gene records available up to 22 April 2015), only 3.15 and 1.73% are ‘REVIEWED’ and ‘VALIDATED’ records, respectively, while almost all of the entries are ‘PROVISIONAL’ (92.88%), according to the entry status as provided by RefSeq. Among all the ‘Gene_Table’ exon/intron records, 16.9% are derived from an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ RefSeq RNA type sequence. This implies that not only ‘REVIEWED’ and ‘VALIDATED’ but also ‘PROVISIONAL’, ‘INFERRED’ or ‘PREDICTED’ genes can present a gene product derived from these types of sequences. In addition, there are some discrepancies regarding the ‘live’ status provided by NCBI even for genes not annotated on the most recent genome annotation, addressed in GeneBase with the ‘Genome_Annotation_Status’ field, which is useful to filter out these entries. We also observed that in some cases, a ‘REVIEWED’ gene (for example Gene ID: 405306) with an ‘NM_’ RNA type product has an intron of 0 bp (or even -1 bp) length which is biologically not sound, but combined with the ‘low-quality sequence region’ markup in the corresponding RefSeq genome sequence, it indicates a compensation for genome assembly defects. The structuration of data of our database (e.g. numbers are seen as numeric fields) along with an intuitive user-friendly graphic interface allows users to perform many types of searches, even to exclude these kind of artifacts, and to make comparisons and calculations that are useful for data retrieval and analysis. The use of numeric fields has the specific advantage of making it possible to search for the exact number (or range), thus avoiding, querying ‘1’, for example, other unwanted results, such as 10, 11, 12 and so forth.28,29 In addition, calculation fields were created to generate further data that are not present in the original NCBI gene entries or in other databases, making the analysis capability of GeneBase unique. For example, the 3'-untranslated or 3'-translated and untranslated terminal exons30 are well known for their particular characteristics (e.g. the presence of the termination codon, the polyadenylation site and an average length) and sometimes for their implications in pathological nonsense mutations escaping nonsense-mediated decay.31 They cannot usually be retrieved with other databases, while GeneBase shows specific indexed calculation fields, labelling these exons as ‘Last_Exon’ and ‘Last_Coding_Exon’ (Fig. 2), to highlight their importance and to make them easily retrievable. In addition, specific fields showing related information from relational software tables allow users to perform original crossed searches of many entry features in a single organism of interest as well as across a full range of species. Finally, the implementation with exon (both coding and not coding) and intron sequences (Fig. 2) gives rise to original and previously unexplored gene information and sequence correlations.GeneBase database contains a wealth of interesting biological information, and we provide an original analysis of the existing introns across all the available species as an example application to confirm its usefulness.Although several exon and/or intron databases32–38 and NCBI Gene parsers5–8 exist, to our knowledge none is able to dynamically generate a fully structured relational database that could be updated (regenerated) by any user, with an intuitive user-friendly graphic interface that allows any type of further calculations and analysis. Use of NCBI Gene data has the advantage of allowing users to avoid GenBank redundancy purging procedures used to develop an Exon-Intron Database (EID),32 the Intron Exon-Knowledge base (IE-Kb),33 another Exon-Intron Database (ExInt)35 and the database of eukaryotic protein-encoding genes (Xpro).37 In the particular case of multiple transcript variants presenting the same exon or intron, the ‘Non_Redundant’ fields are useful for searching for unique exons and introns. On the other hand, the decision to keep the exon/intron structure of each transcript isoform for each gene, allows the option of, for example, alternative splicing studies.32,37,38 In addition, unlike more specialised databases such as, among others, the database on intron less/single exonic genes (SEGE)36 and the Intron and Intron Evolution Database (IDB and IEDB),34 GeneBase contains exon/intron structure of 5'UTR (untranslated region), coding region and 3'UTR of coding and non-coding nuclear genes,33,34,37 as well as intronless genes.36 In the NCBI Gene subset parsed and loaded into GeneBase, the majority of gene entries does not belong to C. elegans or to A. thaliana (Taxonomy IDs: 6239 and 3702, respectively), unlike for example in ExInt35 and in IDB and IEDB,34 but to H. sapiens (Taxonomy ID: 9606), in agreement with the current choice to exclude gene entries with a ‘MODEL’ RefSeq status.32 In any case, the user can select and download any NCBI Gene entry set for parsing.Exploiting our ‘Gene_Table’ database table, which collects exon/intron structure for each gene product, our aim was to find the minimal intron, namely the minimal known DNA sequence element that can function as an intron. The overall distribution of intron (Supplementary Fig. S2) and the high standard deviation (Tables 1 and 2) reflects the extreme variation in intron lengths.33 Regarding the chosen representative organisms, A. thaliana, C. elegans, T. castaneum and D. melanogaster (Taxonomy IDs: 3702, 6239, 7070 and 7227, respectively) have only one major narrow peak around 100 bp, while Danio rerio (Taxonomy ID: 7955) has two similar peaks (Supplementary Fig. S3). Other chosen representative vertebrates (Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus and H. sapiens, Taxonomy IDs: 8364, 9031, 10090 and 9606, respectively) have one initial minor narrow peak and a subsequent higher and wider one (Supplementary Fig. S3). It is interesting to note that M. musculus and H. sapiens (Taxonomy ID: 9606) trends are remarkably overlapping (Supplementary Fig. S3), in accordance with an earlier report.10 Mean intron lengths of these organisms significantly correlate with their genome length and a noteworthy correlation can be found considering only Vertebrata (Taxonomy ID: 7742, Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).The intron length problem, which currently raises researchers’ interest,17 has recently also been addressed by Sasaki-Haraguchi et al.,39 limiting their study to the human genome. They demonstrate an alternative splicing leading to low efficiency to the removal of an ultra-short 43 bp intron of the ESRP2 gene (Gene ID: 80004), following transfection of a construct containing the intron and the two flanking exons in human cultured neoplastic cells. This 43 bp intron is not currently annotated in the NCBI Gene database.Uncertainty in defining the minimal intron length can be due to sequencing errors in genomes, to artifacts in intron size determination by annotation pipelines and to the lack of a tool like GeneBase, which is especially useful for retrieving data with numerical range constraints. As other authors previously supposed40 and verified,38 annotation errors and mismatches between the sequenced transcript and the reference genome can even generate one-nucleotide long introns, which we still came across too (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). Despite the additional exclusion procedure of gene ‘MODEL’ and the decision to consider only ‘REVIEWED’ or ‘VALIDATED’ gene entries with an ‘NM_’ or ‘NR_’ type of corresponding RefSeq RNA accession number, we were compelled to validate our results through a further bioinformatic analysis,37,38 which yielded 8.8% of actual intron sequences in this subset (Supplementary Table S2). The validation process was also hindered by genomic sequence repetitions, but with manual analysis, it was possible to identify intron sequences that had been erroneously annotated (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, 141 sequences derived from an annotated genomic sequences belonging to A. thaliana (Taxonomy ID: 3702). These lack experimental evidence as indicated in RefSeq Nucleotide entries and by the gene confidence ranking provided by TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource at https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp)41 and were not considered further.Following our analyses based on all currently available data, the shortest eukaryotic GT-AG intron length belongs to the human MST1L gene (MST1-like, Gene ID: 11223), encoding for the putative macrophage stimulating 1-like protein, setting the physical limit of the intron size at 30 bp (Table 4). Remarkably, the 30 bp size is indeed consistent with the sum of the 5'/3' splicing consensus site lengths.16,24,42 Unlike MST1 (Gene ID: 4485), for which 153 orthologs are reported in NCBI Gene, MST1L (Gene ID: 11223, which is the MST1 human paralog) lacks experimentally confirmed orthologs in other species. This is probably due to the fact that MST1L (Gene ID: 11223) appears to be an interesting case of ‘resurrected’ pseudogene in humans, so that it is now classified as a protein-coding gene with mass spectrometry evidence for the polypeptide product.43 Another human minimal intron validated through our application is the AQP12A 37 bp intron (Gene ID: 375318, Supplementary Table S3). Its sequence existence was also confirmed by a work published while this study was being submitted for publication.25 Finally, the inclusion in our analysis of organisms not present in other genome browsers also gave us the opportunity to validate four introns shorter than 40 bp of T. castaneum (Taxonomy ID: 7070).Thanks to their small size, our ‘model introns’ will help identify the basic and crucial minimal requirement elements of recognition used by the cell for conventional splicing functioning. We were able to locate possible pyrimidine-rich regions and possible consensus branch points, although only one intron (LOC656453, Gene ID: 656453, Supplementary Table S4) presents the whole classic eukaryotic consensus sequence YNYYRAYY.16 The shortest validated human introns (MST1L 30 bp intron, Gene ID: 11223 and AQP12A 37 bp intron, Gene ID: 375318) present a G-rich sequence, as shown for other ultra-short human introns (Supplementary Table S4).25 The typical alternative splicing sites GYNGYN44 or NAGNAG for ‘subtle splicing’45–47 were not identified. Recent advances in the study of alternative splicing show that part of the maturation process of the primary transcript produces errors and creates stochastic noise.48,49 This would increase the difficulties faced by intron prediction tools taking into account all the well-known factors: 5'/3' splice site, branch point, splicing regulatory elements such as exonic/intronic splicing enhancers/silencers, the spliceosome and other trans-acting elements.50 In the light of the observed data, the formation of secondary structures of the primary transcript might intervene in intron identification by the cell.51 More in-depth analysis of minimal introns to test this possibility will be necessary in the future.Our analysis presented here confirms the difficulties still encountered in working with genomic sequences and is a starting point for further studies. Furthermore, it depends on the chosen gene entry subset and on the RefSeq classification system and is subject to the accuracy of the input dataset. On the other hand, our example application shows how a simple biological question such as how long the minimal GT-AG intron is (a numeric datum combined with a sequence feature) in all eukaryotic validated genes (which means a selection of a common gene characteristic in different organisms) is easily achievable with a single search, thanks to the GeneBase architecture. To our knowledge, GeneBase is a unique example of a database which relationally correlates and allows the complete elaboration of gene-associated meta-information data and the corresponding sequences across different organisms. Our tool's strength is also to allow large-scale analysis of genes, considerably increasing the possibilities for the study of the 2.4 million genes available in the NCBI Gene databank. Furthermore, GeneBase is useful for studying other characteristic intron lengths and sequences such as, for example, the unusual length of 5'-end first introns52 in terms of evolution and gene expression levels.53–55 The implementations of different databases using the same platform (FileMaker) recently led to intriguing results.56 In conjunction with quantitative transcriptome mapping in normal57 and pathological58 human cell types, GeneBase may represent the nucleus for a novel relational multi-purpose and user-friendly modular platform for the analysis of biological data, from meta-information of genes to their sequences and expression values. It will especially be used in the context of our current reanalysis of human chromosome 21 gene content to identify new targets for trisomy 21.59AvailabilityGeneBase (both pre-loaded and empty versions), the ‘Database Design Report’, the user guide and the relative Python scripts for the initial data pre-processing and sequence calculations are publicly available at http://apollo11.isto.unibo.it/software/.FundingThis work was funded by ‘RFO’ grants from Alma Mater Studiorum—University of Bologna to P.S. and L.V.
