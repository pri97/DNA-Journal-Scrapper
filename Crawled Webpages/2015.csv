IntroductionOlive (Olea europaea L.) is an evergreen species that is sensitive to winter chilling temperatures with severe leaf damage at -7°C.1 Olive oil is the major product extracted from olive fruit, and its consumption is steadily growing worldwide. The process of cold acclimation is very complex and involves diverse physiological, metabolic, and developmental changes that are under strict genetic control.2 The identity of the cold-stress sensor in plants is yet unknown.3 Nevertheless, early changes in membrane rigidification leading to certain cytoskeletal rearrangement has been proposed to be a cellular sensor for cold stress,4,5 in addition to metabolic or redox status alterations. Changes in membrane fluidity lead to a transient induction of Ca2+ channels and a raised cytosolic Ca2+ level, which acts as a second messenger in the early sensing of low temperatures.6 Cold acclimation is the result of several processes, such as the synthesis of cryoprotectant molecules and membrane phospholipids, protein stabilization, maintenance of ion homeostasis, and a stress response mainly mediated by the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS).7–9 Cold response involves around 1,000 genes in Arabidopsis, as previously shown by whole transcriptome analyses.10,11 A relevant number of cold-regulated genes encode transcription factors or proteins involved in transcription.12 Among these, C-repeat binding factor (CBF)/dehydration responsive element binding consists of transcriptional activators that provide one of the most important pathways for cold response.13–15 The expression of the CBF genes is induced after an increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ level and is responsible for controlling the expression of a large number of cold-response (COR) proteins.16 The CBFs bind to the low-temperature-responsive DNA-regulatory element termed C-repeat/dehydration-response element13,14 present in the promoters of many COR genes. Nevertheless, the analysis of cold acclimation in the olive drupe and seed has shown an important role of ‘fatty-acid desaturase (FAD)’ genes in cold tolerance and oil quality.17,18 These FAD genes contribute to cold acclimation by increasing the presence of unsaturated fatty acids which produce cell-membrane fluidification and F-actin stabilization.19,20 However, little is known about the gene-expression changes occurring during cold acclimation in this important crop, and no transcriptomic analysis has been conducted to determine the genetic changes induced by cold stress. The aim of this work was to study whole transcriptome changes induced in leaves of olive plants by above-freezing cold stress.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and cold-stress inductionTo induce stress by long-term exposure to low temperature, we used 4-month-old potted olive plants of the cv. Picual. These plants were obtained from a commercial nursery located in Córdoba province, southern Spain. Before being subjected to the low-temperature treatment, they were acclimated at 24°C day light for 3 weeks within the same controlled growth chamber where the cold-stress assay was conducted. Afterwards, we incubated a group of 35 plants under the following environmental conditions: 14-h photoperiod of fluorescent light at 65 µmol m2 s (10°C day/4°C night) for 10 days and constant 76–78% relative humidity. An additional group of 15 plants remained as a control treatment. Time of cold exposure was considered from the moment at which the growth chamber reached the working temperature for the first time in daylight (i.e. 10°C). Aerial tissues were then harvested at 0 h, 24 h, and 10 days (three plants/time point) after the start of the experiment. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until the extraction of total RNA. In order to build an olive transcriptome of diverse biotic and abiotic stresses, mechanical wounding and infection with the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae were also considered. This pathogen is the causal agent of Verticillium wilt of olive, one of the most serious diseases affecting olive cultivation in many areas.21 Therefore, an additional set of nursery-produced ‘Picual’ plants (40) were submitted to root-dip inoculation in a conidia suspension of a V. dahliae isolate representative of the so-called defoliating pathotype, following the procedure detailed in Mercado-Blanco et al.22 with the modification that inoculation time was only 30 min. Non-inoculated plants (40), but manipulated in the same way (control treatment), were used to obtain tissue samples of wounded plants in the absence of the pathogen. Functional genomics analysis of these responses will be published elsewhere, but the complete ‘olive stress transcriptome’ is referred here for the first time.2.2. RNA sample preparation and high-throughput sequencingRNA samples were extracted from the leaves of three replicates of control and the 24-h and 10-day cold-stress-treated plants. Total RNA was extracted using a Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any DNA contamination was removed by DNase I treatment on column (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The RNA quality tests were performed with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an RNA 6000 Pico assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We pooled RNA from each time and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries and sequencing in Illumina HiSeq 1000 sequencer was performed by GeneSystems (Valencia, Spain). Two replicates of each sample were sequenced on different lanes in the flow cell.2.3. Bioinformatic analysisQuality control of sequencing was performed using NGS_QC software.23 After trimming and cleaning, we obtained 149,638,888 paired-end reads of 101 bp length and 35 Phred quality (30.21 Gb). The ABySS-pe 1.3.3 software24,25 was used for de novo assembly in ‘Picasso’ supercomputer (www.scbi.uma.es). The ABySS software was chosen due to memory use and time limits for users in ‘Picasso’ at that moment, since ABySS had previously shown a good balance between memory use, runtime, and integrity of assembled genes.26 The command-line parameters used were abyss-pe k=64 n=10 j=2 name=library1 in=’/library1_R1.fastq library1_R2.fastq’ so that the minimum number of pairs required for building scaffolds was 10. We also included additional read sets corresponding to other stress conditions (Supplementary Data). Firstly, each library was assembled separately, producing a number of scaffolds ranging from 96,268 to 276,359. On average, the N50 length, average length, and maximal length for the 8,090,448 scaffolds obtained were 661, 312, and 8,791 bases, respectively. The mapping analysis with bowtie227 showed that 87.4% of reads on average aligned end to end on those scaffolds (bowtie2 parameters: -D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 22 -i S,1,1.15) and 93.2% aligned locally (-D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.75). Secondly, to collapse all related sequences that could not have done so during the first assembly step, the scaffolds of all libraries were assembled using ABySS single-end (k-mer = 63). Finally, contigs shorter than 200 bases and any sequence with no best hit for a plant but for a different organism were removed from the assembly using BLAST 2.2.20 software28 with a minimum expectation value of 1e-5. Mapping analysis with bowtie2 in the same way as above showed that 65% of reads on average aligned end to end on the final unigenes while 83.5% aligned locally. Other quality parameters for the new transcriptome were calculated by means of NGS_QC for the GC percentage, GenoToolBox (https://github.com/aubombarely/GenoToolBox) for basic stats, and Full-LengtherNext 0.0.8 (FLN) for sequence structure analysis.29Sma3s30,31 with default parameters was used in ‘Picasso’ supercomputer for functional annotation of all unigenes based on the similarity with UniProt-annotated sequences, in particular, using plant taxonomy. The gene-expression study was made with the DNAStar (ArrayStar 4) Qseq software for RNAseq analysis (www.dnastar.com). We undertook mapping using parameters k-mer = 63 and 95% of matches and used the default normalization method of ‘reads per kilobase per million mapped reads', RPKM.32 The gene ontology (GO) terms retrieved by Sma3s were loaded as an annotation file or .annot in the Blast2GO suite V2.7.033,34 to carry out the statistical analysis of GO-term enrichment. Blast2GO has integrated the Gossip package for statistical assessment of differences in GO-term abundance between two sets of sequences.35 This package employs the Fisher's exact test and corrects for multiple testing. We performed a one-tailed Fisher's exact test. The test was made using a false discovery rate (FDR), with a filter value <0.05. Blast2GO returns the GO terms over-represented at a specified significance value.34 The results were saved in a Microsoft Excel datasheet, and charts were generated.2.4. Quantitative real-time–polymerase chain reaction analysisFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA primed with 60 µM of random hexamer primer and Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase, using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT–PCR) was performed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 PCR system with master mix SsoFastTM EvaGreen® Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), in 10 µl of reaction mixture, containing 10 ng of cDNA. Amplifications were performed under the following conditions: initial polymerase activation at 98°C for 30, then 40 cycles at 98°C for 5 s, and at 60°C for 10 s, followed by a melting step from 65 to 95°C. An internal control of constitutive olive actin was used for the normalization of results. The constitutive normalization control was selected after comparing several genes and primer pairs on different olive tissues and found to be the most constant in expression.36 The oligonucleotides used for the amplifications are listed in Supplementary Data. Each PCR reaction was performed three times, and three different trees were analysed at every time of cold exposure.2.5.

Results and discussion3.1. Environmental conditions and stress symptoms of olive plants under low-temperature treatmentOlive ‘Picual’ plants subjected to low temperature displayed clearly visible symptoms of stress 24 h after starting the experiment, compared with control plants (Fig. 1A and B). The vast majority of plants had flaccid leaves, resembling wilting symptoms (Fig. 1C and D). However, 4–5 days after the start of the experiment, plants progressively recovered from these symptoms, and nearly no trace of flaccid or wilted leaves remained at the end of the experiment (10 days of exposure to low temperature) (Fig. 1E and F). This result shows that a sudden fall in temperature, even if this is above 0°C, can trigger clear morphological changes and stress symptoms in olive plants. However, in just a few days most plants were fully recovered and were not distinguishable from the unstressed ones. Low-temperature treatment caused an overproduction of H2O2 accompanied by a down-regulation of SOD isoenzymes, a key enzyme of the ascorbate–glutathione cycle (APX) and an antioxidant NADP-dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH). During long-term cold acclimation at 10 days, a slight recovery of Mn-SOD and NADP-ICDH was detected, indicating that a mechanism of cold acclimation takes place (Supplementary Data). This showed the ability of olive plants to rapidly acclimate to prolonged cold stress.

Transcriptome assembly, functional annotation, and expression analysisThe transcriptome was assembled from a total of 741,674,755 high-quality paired-end reads (149.77 Gb; Supplementary Data). Each sample was separately assembled using the ABySS-pe software with a k-mer = 64. Finally, all samples were re-assembled together with the ABySS single-end using a k-mer = 63. The final transcriptome (OlePic) contains 157,799 unigenes with an N50 length of 700 bases, an average length of 544 bases, a maximal length of 11,114 bases, 46% GC, and 0% undetermined. The distribution by length of the unigenes generated in the assembly is shown in Fig. 2A. The result shows that although OlePic has a higher number of assembled transcripts, the distribution by length is similar to the currently available, most complete olive transcriptome AS8. In addition, OlePic is enriched in longer contigs than AS8 in a similar way as the Mimulus guttatus one, the available plant transcriptome most phylogenetically related to Olive tree.37 On the other hand, mapping analysis with bowtie2 showed that, on average, 65% of original reads aligned with OlePic end to end and 83.5% aligned locally. It can therefore be concluded that the vast majority of the reads sequenced are represented in this new transcriptome. Another common assessment of the quality of the assembled database is provided by the coverage. The minimum k-mer coverage for each unigene was 400 (Fig. 2B), and 88% of contigs were covered for >1,000 k-mer of 63 bases. Regarding cold stress, all reads derived from the cold experiment samples were mapped end to end to the assembly (Fig. 2C). In addition, 73.3% of unigenes were covered for reads obtained in this study (115,644 unigenes). From these unigenes, 82.5% were covered by more than at least 50 reads. The OlePic transcripts’ similarity and transcriptome coverage with olive AS8 transcriptome and other phylogenetically related species (monkey flower,37 tomato,38 grapevine39 and rose gum40) were measured by blastn algorithm from BLAST software at different expectation values (Fig. 3). Consistently with the established phylogenetic relationships, the percentage of cDNA sequences with hits in OlePic was proportional to the different species phylogenetic likelihood.

The cDNA sequences of AS8 and olive-related plant species were mapped to OlePic by using the blastn algorithm from blast/2.2.20 software.The annotation algorithm used, Sma3s, searches with three steps of significance that sequentially retrieve annotations from (i) already existing annotated sequences, (ii) orthologous sequences, and (iii) groups of sequences sharing a statistically significant pattern. Nevertheless, Sma3s retrieved annotations from Uniprot plant database for 48% of the transcriptome (75,772 unigenes).All in all, ABySS reduced the original number of sequences by 99.99%. The percentage of GC was very similar to that of 42.5% reported previously for other olive assemblies.30,41 Unlike these recent studies, our starting material consisted exclusively of short reads. Nevertheless, the average length, integrity of assembled genes, and number of unigenes annotated were improved compared with the currently available, most complete olive transcriptome AS8.30 In addition, analysis of OlePic with FLN comparing with AS8 and M. guttatus (28,282 protein-coding transcripts) indicates a similar structure pattern in OlePic compared with AS8 (Supplementary Data). As expected, FLN found 27,207 M. guttatus transcripts with orthologue of which 18,344 were complete. FLN found 88,034 transcripts with orthologues in OlePic of which 11,436 were complete. This supports the contention that the use of short paired-end data can lead to an efficient assembly of transcriptomes, as previously anticipated.42,43 Furthermore, another mapping analysis with bowtie2 algorithm showed that 69% of AS8 sequences aligned locally in OlePic assembly. Taking into account that AS8 was constructed from different cultivars and more diverse tissues, global results indicate that our assembly is good enough to analyse gene-expression changes in olive tree; and, more importantly, it includes environmental-stress-response transcripts which are crucial for this study. The RNAseq analysis showed 6,309 unigenes differentially expressed with a minimum 8-fold change and 95% significance.3.3. Short-term transient gene-expression changes in response to cold stressThe response of plants to prolonged stress stimuli may involve both transient reactions shortly decaying after the first moments of stress exposure and adaptive changes sustained over time. The result of comparing 0 and 1 day of cold exposure was that 1,694 unigenes were differentially expressed (8-fold change and 95% significance), 1,094 of them were over-expressed, and 600 were repressed after the first 24 h of low-temperature exposure. However, about half of these unigenes (896) returned to normal expression levels after 10 days of low-temperature exposure (890 over-expressed and only 6 repressed). These unigenes represent a group of genes showing a transient response to cold stress (Fig. 4A and B; Supplementary Data). This transient response resulted from the induction of expression for at least the first 24 h of cold stress in almost all genes. However, expression returned to normal levels after prolonged exposure to low temperature.

The GO terms retrieved by Sma3s for 361 sequences from 910 transient unigenes and for 43,696 sequences from 97,532 unigenes expressed in control leaves were loaded in Blast2GO suite V2.7.0 to perform the statistical analysis of GO-term enrichment. Unchecked, the two-tail box was used to analyse only positive enrichment. The test was made choosing a filter cut-off value of FDR < 1e-7. The results are shown in Fig. 5 as the percentage of sequences which annotated for each ‘biological process' GO term for both control leaves and transient COR unigenes. Bars are labelled with their corresponding P-values in the Fisher exact test. Most of the GO terms were parent–child related and involved mainly in lipid polymers, oligosaccharide, and polyamine metabolism (Fig. 5).

Unigenes that annotated for these processes were identified, including GPAT5 (494,160 and 276,135), FAE1 (unigenes 47,056, 481,778, and 497,978), and CER1/WAX2 (unigenes 372,554, 24,079, 312,953, 306,126, 456,548, and 409,294). Here, we report six CER-like genes in olive, all of which respond transiently to cold stress. In addition, 81 unigenes annotated for seven GO terms associated with oligosaccharide metabolism (Fig. 5). Oligosaccharides are ubiquitous in plants and have been associated with freezing tolerance in various species. Four unigenes (362,593, 453,896, 511,359, and 174,049) were associated with the seven GO terms and coded for a stachyose synthase.On the other hand, we observed a transient induction for several unigenes involved in polyamine biosynthesis including arginine decarboxylases (ADC) (unigenes 62,085, 57,082, 612,727, 22,384, 531,518, 266,717, 417,814, 417,815, 416,039, and 494,283), amine oxidase flavin domain-containing protein (unigenes 233,490 and 205,434), and peroxisome polyamine oxidase (unigenes 515,010 and 479,660).Consequently, with most representative ‘biological processes' found, statistically significant GO terms for ‘biological function’ were arginine decarboxylase activity, aldehyde decarbonylase activity, oxidoreductase activity, carbon–carbon lyase activity, oxidoreductase activity, choline kinase activity, inositol 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase activity, and beta-amylase activity. No ‘biological component’ GO term was found for the chosen FDR cut-off.3.4. Early long-term gene expression changes during cold acclimationTogether with the transient response to cold stress, a set of genes showing a sustained response to cold stress for a prolonged time period (10 days) was identified. Thus, 798 unigenes out of the 1,694 with significant 8-fold change between 0 and 1 day under low temperature still remained up-regulated 10 days under cold stress. Therefore, these genes are likely to take part in an adaptive response to low temperature. In this case, 204 unigenes were induced during the cold exposure, whereas 594 were repressed (Fig. 4C and D; Supplementary Data).One important adaptive response to cold is the induction of FADs to regulate the fluidity of the cellular membrane. Indeed, an increase in FAD activity relaxes cellular membrane rigidity.44 In olive, FAD2.2 and FAD7 increased their expression in epi–mesocarp cells during the oleogenic period.17 However, just OeFAD2 transcription increased in both the embryo and the seed coat in cold-acclimated drupes.18,45 We have found in the olive transcriptome unigenes that the code for FAD2.1, FAD2.2, FAD6, FAD7, and two FAD3, one previously described that we have called FAD3.1 and a new one called FAD3.2. The RNAseq analysis has shown that OeFAD2.2 is the only FAD-coding gene that increased its expression in response to cold in ‘Picual’ leaves (Fig. 6A). The OeFAD2.2 was induced shortly after the start of the cold exposure and maintained a high expression level after 10 days of low-temperature treatment (Fig. 6A), even though a general tendency towards a reduction in transcription was observed for most genes (Fig. 7). This could probably be explained as a consequence of a diminished metabolism of the plant. This finding supports the idea that FAD2.2 is the desaturase involved in cold response in olive leaves, in agreement with previous results,17,18,45 suggesting that FAD2.2 is the main desaturase involved in cold response in olive.

We found four unigenes that were induced by cold in a sustained manner while the low temperature persisted. However, three of them decreased their expression between 1 and 10 days of cold exposure but still remained significantly higher than in control plants (Fig. 6B). The four CBF genes were strongly induced between 0 and 1 day of low-temperature exposure. Nevertheless, only OeCBF3 showed a steady increase in its expression after 10 days of cold treatment, suggesting that OeCBF3 might be responsible for inducing COR gene expression, showing a late response to cold stress (Table 1 and Fig. 6B). The sequence similarity between Arabidopsis CBF coding sequences and the OeCBF unigenes did not allow us to identify exact orthologues in the Arabidopsis CBF family. Thus, they were numbered without any correspondence to the Arabidopsis nomenclature (Table 1). This means that the family of CBF genes in olive consists of at least four genes with an unclear correspondence to the Arabidopsis annotation of CBF1, CBF2, or CBF3.

The percentage of sequences that annotated for each ‘biological process' or ‘function’ GO term for both control and early long-term COR unigenes is shown in Fig. 8. No ‘biological component’ GO term was found for the chosen FDR cut-off. These unigenes were enriched in GO terms associated with three processes: regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis, cold acclimation, and development regulation. This result supports the idea that these genes are likely involved in an adaptive response to low temperature.

Twenty unigenes were associated with nitrogen metabolism and 34 with photosynthesis (Supplementary Data). Therefore, our results indicate a down-regulation of photosynthesis and plant growth, and both ‘component’ and ‘function’ GO terms found were consistent with these results.3.5. Late long-term gene-expression changes during cold acclimationPlants respond to stress by global transcriptional changes that can be transient or sustained over time and with early- and late-responsive gene-expression alterations.46 Changes in gene expression in response to cold can be affected by differences in cold sensitivity. For instance, a general up-regulation trend in a chilling-tolerant genotype and an overall repression tendency in a sensitive genotype were found in rice.47 In our study, ‘Picual’ olive plants were subjected to low temperatures to which they can acclimate, and the cold-stress symptoms disappeared after 6 or 7 days of cold exposure (Fig. 1). We found a general trend towards gene repression after a period of 24 h at low temperature (Fig. 7). Thus, at 8-fold change and 95% significance, 4,551 unigenes were down-regulated between days 1 and 10 of low-temperature exposure and only 64 unigenes were over-expressed.We performed the GO-term enrichment analysis as above with the GO terms retrieved by Sma3s for 31 sequences from 64 over-expressed late long-term unigenes using a cut-off value of FDR < 0.01. The percentage of sequences that annotated for each ‘biological process' or ‘function’ GO term for both control leaves and early long-term COR unigenes is shown in Fig. 9. No ‘biological component’ GO term was found for the chosen FDR cut-off. It was observed that the most representative processes were related to organelle fusion, nucleus organization, and DNA integration (Fig. 9). Among 20 sequences associated with organelle fusion and nucleus organization, four Flavin Adenin (FAD)-binding Berberine-like unigenes (unigenes 254,633, 435,666, 525,595, and 313,705) were shared by both processes. Six sequences were associated with DNA integration. They were annotated as Ty3-gypsy subclass, Gag-pol polyprotein, retroelement polyprotein-like, Copia-type polyprotein, and integrase (unigenes 104,981, 285,292, 627,965, 95,624, 510,781, and 36,107). Thus, they are putative transposable elements (TEs, jumping genes).

The ‘biological processes’, ‘functions’, and ‘components’ associated with 2,147 from 4,551 repressed unigenes are shown in Supplementary Data. Results confirmed that unigenes related to photosynthesis and plant growth are inhibited mostly during a late response to cold. Further experimental evidence is required to determine whether AGO-like, bHLH-like, Berberine-like, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons are responsible for this major down-regulation during late cold acclimation in olive tree.3.6. RNAseq validation by Q-RT–PCRThe expression of 20 randomly selected genes was analysed by Q-RT–PCR in nine trees, three for each time of cold exposure. As a result, the pattern of expression observed was very similar between Q-RT–PCR and RNAseq results in 18 of the 20 genes analysed, while for OlePic_t_481778 the induction after 1 day of cold exposure was weaker by Q-RT–PCR than by RNAseq, and for OlePic_t_288134 the pattern was opposite at 10 days of cold exposure (Fig. 10). This result confirms that the expression patterns of mRNA obtained by RNAseq reflect real changes of gene expression. Figure 10.Open in new tabDownload slideAnalysis of mRNA level by Q-RT–PCR.

ConclusionsOlive plants cv. Picual were sensitive to cold stress as observed by morphological and ROS enzymes changes. However, they were also able to fully recover after 5 days of low temperatures, indicating the existence of acclimation mechanisms to cold. A new transcriptome for stressed olive plants was built up and used to analyse the transcriptomic response to cold. We found 6,309 unigenes differentially expressed in response to cold, which were included in three types of responses leading to cold acclimation: a short-term transient response including 890 over-expressed and only 6 repressed unigenes, an early long-term response that consisted in 204 over-expressed and 594 repressed unigenes, and a late long-term response with 4,551 unigenes down-regulated between days 1 and 10 of low temperature exposure, and just 64 unigenes were over-expressed.The results presented here suggest a complex acclimation response to cold in olive leaves with early transient or long-term and late transcriptional responses.FundingThis work was supported by grant AGR-5948 from Junta de Andalucía (Consejería de Economía, Innovación y Ciencia) and Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación.

IntroductionMethylation occurring at the position 5 of cytosine residues in DNA is an epigenetic modification critically involved in the regulation of eukaryotic genomes. Accordingly, the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine residues, or the methylome, has been attracting intense attention from a wide audience in a variety of research disciplines. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the way of interrogating the methylome: it has realized whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or genome-wide methylation analysis at single-base resolution.1,2 The power of WGBS has been well demonstrated by many findings that would never have been achieved with other technologies. Although WGBS represents the gold standard for methylome analysis and is rapidly becoming the method of choice, its cost has remained substantial, thereby preventing it from being widely used for multi-sample comparison of large methylomes including those of mammals.The most popular alternative to WGBS is reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), which efficiently enriches CpG-rich regions through restriction enzyme digestion to reduce the cost of sequencing, while maintaining deep coverage of a subset of CpG sites.3 Notably, RRBS can be applied to a minute amount of input DNA.4 However, it cannot be used to examine particular regions of interest unless they are adequately flanked by the restriction enzyme sites. In this context, the shotgun bisulfite sequencing of subgenomic regions enriched using solution hybridization capture technology, referred to hereafter as targeted methylome sequencing (TMS), is ideal, because it can in principle target any unique genomic region.5–7 However, all of the TMS protocols reported thus far require not only a considerable amount of input DNA (i.e. 3 µg or more), but also a large number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles (i.e. 10–20 cycles), making it difficult to apply TMS to samples of limited quantity.We recently developed a highly efficient protocol for WGBS library construction termed post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT).8 Although it is well known that bisulfite treatment destroys DNA, all of the conventional ligation-based WGBS protocols as well as the tagmentation-based one9 treat adaptor-tagged library DNAs with bisulfite, inevitably leading to a considerable loss of intact sequencing template molecules. To circumvent this bisulfite-induced loss, we proposed the PBAT strategy in which adaptor tagging is performed after bisulfite treatment. This simple trick allowed us to prepare a PCR-free WGBS library from as little as 125 pg of input DNA.8 We routinely achieve a PCR-free, 30-fold coverage of mammalian methylomes from ~30 ng of input DNA. Indeed, PBAT has been applied to mouse WGBS from 400 to 1,000 germinal vesicle-stage oocytes10,11 and a few thousand primordial germ cells,12 notably without any global PCR amplification. More recently, it has even been applied to single-cell genome-wide bisulfite sequencing with the aid of PCR.13As all of the current TMS protocols include bisulfite treatment of adaptor-tagged library DNA, we reasoned that PBAT can improve the efficiency of TMS to develop a low-input protocol (Fig. 1). We have indeed succeeded in the development of a highly efficient TMS method applicable to samples of limited quantity. Figure 1.Open in new tabDownload slideTwo strategies for TMS.

Materials and methods2.1. Preparation of DNABoth human and mouse genomic DNAs used in the model experiments were purchased from Promega. Genomic DNA from IMR90 primary human lung fibroblasts was a generous gift from Yae Kanai. The indicated amount of genomic DNA was dissolved in 130 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and sheared with Covaris S220 to the indicated size. We used AMPure XP to purify the fragmented DNA as follows. First, the shared DNA (130 µl) was mixed with 1.8× volume (234 µl) of the AMPure XP reagent and stood for 15 min at room temperature. Next, the beads were collected using a magnet stand, and the supernatant was removed. The pelleted beads were then rinsed with 70% ethanol and dried by standing at 37°C for 5 min. Finally, DNA was eluted from the beads to 20 µl of RNase-free water. The eluted DNA solution was dried in a vacuum concentrator and dissolved in 7 µl of RNase-free water.2.2. Target enrichmentEnrichment of targets with liquid-phase hybridization capture was performed using the reagents in SureSelect Human or Mouse Methyl-Seq kit (Agilent). Genomic DNA (7 µl) fragmented and purified as above was supplemented with 3 µl of formamide (Wako, Biochemistry grade) and overlaid with 80 µl of mineral oil (Sigma). The DNA was completely denatured by incubating the tube at 99°C for 10 min, cooled down to 65°C and kept at 65°C for at least 5 min before adding the following reagents. Hybridization buffer was prepared by mixing 7.5, 0.3, 3.0 and 3.0 µl of Hyb#1, #2, #3 and #4, respectively. Capture probe mix was prepared by mixing 5.0, 0.5 and 1.0 µl of capture probe solution, RNase Inhibitor and RNase-free water, respectively. The hybridization buffer and the capture probe mix were individually overlaid with 80 µl of mineral oil and incubated at 65°C for 10 min. These two solutions were then combined and mixed thoroughly by pipetting. The combined solution was transferred to the tube containing the denatured input DNA kept at 65°C as above and mixed thoroughly with the DNA solution by pipetting. The tube was incubated at 65°C for at least 24 h to allow hybridization between the probes and the targets.Fifty microlitres of well-suspended solution of DynaBeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Life Technologies) was taken into a 1.5-ml tube, and the beads were washed 2 times with 200 µl of Binding Buffer. To the pelleted beads, the hybridization reaction supplemented with 200 µl of Binding Buffer was added and mixed well. After incubation with rocking at room temperature for 30 min, the beads were collected using a magnetic stand and washed with 500 µl of Wash Buffer 1. The beads were then subjected to three rounds of washing, each composed of re-suspension in pre-warmed Buffer 2 followed by incubation at 65°C for 10 min. Following thorough removal of washing solutions from the tube, enriched DNA was eluted by incubating the beads in 20 µl of Elution solution at room temperature for 20 min. The eluate was immediately used for bisulfite treatment.2.3. Bisulfite treatmentEZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research) was used for the bisulfite treatment of target-enriched DNA, according to manufacturer's instruction. The enriched DNA solution (20 µl) was directly mixed with 130 µl of CT conversion reagent freshly prepared before use. The mixture was incubated at 64°C for 2.5 h. Note that the incubation step at 98°C for 10 min described in the instruction was omitted, because the target-enriched DNA was already denatured. Following the purification and desulfonation steps, bisulfite-treated DNA was eluted with 20 µl of M-Elution buffer.2.4. PBAT library construction and Illumina sequencingWe used the bisulfite-treated DNA for library preparation according to the PBAT protocol14 (also available from http://crest-ihec.jp/english/epigenome/index.html), except for the primers used in the first- and second-strand synthesis. The primer used for the first-strand synthesis was 5'-ACA CTC TTT CCC TAC ACG ACG CTC TTC CGA TCT WWW WNN NN-3' (W = A or T). The indexed primers used for the second-strand synthesis was 5'-CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT XXX XXX GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GCA GGA AAC AGC TAT GAC WWW WNN NN-3', in which XXX XXX stands for the index sequence of each primer. We sequenced the constructed TMS libraries using Illumina HiSeq2500 as described previously.142.5. Data analysisThe obtained reads were mapped to human and mouse DNA using the hg19 and mm9 assemblies, respectively, analysed and visualized as described previously.83. Results3.1. PBAT to target-enriched DNATo test whether PBAT is applicable to TMS library construction, we applied it to target-enriched DNA prepared using the RNA probes provided in the Agilent SureSelect Mouse Methyl-Seq kit, which are designed to cover mouse genomic regions spanning 109 Mb in total. As PBAT employs random primer extension, it is ideal that the primer hybridizes to the 3'-flanking region of each target region in the input DNA and initiates the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand to fully span the target region. We therefore assumed the size of the input DNA to be critical and first examined its effects on the yield of the library. Starting from 3 µg of input DNA, as recommended by the manufacturer, we prepared DNA fragments with an average length of 180 bp, 400 bp or 2 kb (Supplementary DataA). From these DNA preparations, we enriched the targets by solution hybridization capture and successfully generated PCR-free single-read PBAT libraries, each of which was sufficient for one or more lanes in the HiSeq2500 system (Supplementary DataB). Note that the original Methyl-Seq protocol requires a total of 14 cycles of global PCR amplification when starting from the same amount of input DNA (i.e. 3 µg). As expected, the raw yield of library increased with the size of input DNA (Supplementary DataB). However, the normalized yield by the size of input DNA indicated that the 400-bp DNA fragments were most efficient. In addition, the library generated from the 2-kb DNA fragments contained a substantial number of off-target reads that were mapped near to but not onto the targets (Supplementary DataC). We therefore decided to use input DNA fragmented to a size of 400 bp for further development.3.2. Novel primers for improved yield of indexed TMS librariesIt is highly likely that the users of TMS intend to sequence two or more indexed libraries in a single lane for efficient data collection. Thus, we next attempted to improve the efficiency of the PBAT paired-end/indexed read protocol, because it is 2-fold less sensitive than the single-read protocol.14 While the original PBAT protocol uses a random tetramer sequence (N4) attached to the 3'-end of primers containing Illumina adaptor sequences,8 we found that novel primers containing a semi-random tetramer composed solely of A or T bases immediately upstream of the random tetramer (W4N4; W = A or T) improved the yield of TMS library by ~4-fold, with a marginal effect on the GC bias in target coverage (Supplementary Data). We also found that the addition of formamide to the hybridization capture reaction at a final concentration of 10% improved the reproducibility of the target enrichment step (data not shown). These modifications were critical to perform highly sensitive and robust construction of TMS libraries.3.3. Characterization of low-input PBAT-mediated TMS librariesUsing the protocol optimized as above, we prepared indexed TMS libraries from 3,000 to 10 ng of human and mouse DNA using the human and mouse RNA probe sets obtained from Agilent, respectively (Table 1). The yield of library DNA was nearly linearly correlated with the amount of input DNA (Table 1; Supplementary DataA). The smaller the amount of input DNA, the more evident the adaptor dimers were (Supplementary DataB). We performed the minimum cycles of PCR amplification to obtain sufficient DNA for a single HiSeq2500 lane (Table 1). We then used a half lane to sequence each of the human libraries and mapped the obtained reads to the reference human genome sequence. (Note that we combined the library DNA with the same amount of the PhiX control to compensate the extreme base bias of bisulfite-converted sequences.) The mapping rate was inversely correlated with the amount of input DNA within the range of 3,000 to 30 ng, but it showed a prominent decline when the DNA input was reduced to 10 ng (Table 1). In addition, all of the libraries except the one generated from 10 ng of DNA showed similar statistics regarding the coverage of the targets (Fig. 2A). The methylation levels of CpG sites covered by 20 or more reads were highly consistent among these five libraries (R2 > 0.95, when the window size and the step were 500 and 250 bp, respectively) (Fig. 2B). We inspected the methylation status of imprinted genes and found that the expected 50% methylation level was faithfully recapitulated, even in the library generated from 30 ng of DNA, but not in the library obtained from 10 ng of DNA (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the PBAT-mediated TMS method is reliably applicable to as little as 30 ng of input DNA. Table 1.Summary of library constructionTarget species (Target size)

The green dashed box denoted the ICR of PEG3 (chr.19: 57,351,728 to 57,352,173 in hg19 human reference genome sequence).We also performed Methyl-Seq from the same human genomic DNA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer, except that fewer PCR cycles were used (i.e. 11 cycles instead of 14 cycles), and compared the results with those of PBAT-mediated TMS. While the two data sets showed largely consistent methylation levels (R2 = 0.88) (Fig. 2B), they were distinct in terms of the GC content of the covered targets: Methyl-Seq and PBAT-mediated TMS preferentially covered AT-rich and GC-rich targets, respectively (Supplementary Data). This was presumably because the extensive global PCR step in Methyl-Seq failed to amplify GC-rich regions and because the random priming from the PBAT adaptor primers was rather compromised in AT-rich regions. We also note that the Methyl-Seq data recapitulated the methylation status of imprinted genes less precisely than the PBAT data (Fig. 2C).Having confirmed the high efficiency and consistency of PBAT-mediated TMS, we next compared it with WGBS. We performed TMS using 300 ng of genomic DNA from human IMR90 cells and compared the resulting data with PBAT-mediated WGBS data from the same cell line. The methylation levels of CpG sites covered by 20 or more reads showed an excellent correlation between the two data sets in either the window-based or the nucleotide-based analysis (Fig. 3). These results indicated that TMS can be a reliable alternative to WGBS. Figure 3.Open in new tabDownload slideConsistency between TMS and WGBS data.

DiscussionWGBS has become the gold standard method in methylomics for its unsurpassed resolution and coverage. However, it is too expensive to be used for analysing multiple samples. Efforts have thus been paid to develop cost-effective alternatives to WGBS, including various TMS methods based on padlock probes, array capture and solution hybridization capture.7 Among these approaches, the last one is highly flexible, but current protocols require a considerable amount of input DNA and are not applicable to samples of limited quantity.5,6 Furthermore, they include extensive global PCR amplification, which may increase the risk of inaccurate estimate of methylation levels, especially when the quantity of input DNA is limited. Therefore, a novel TMS protocol is desirable that requires a much smaller amount of input DNA with far fewer cycles of global PCR amplification than current ones. As the inefficiency of current protocols is likely attributable to bisulfite-induced degradation of target-enriched library DNA (Fig. 1A), we reasoned that the PBAT strategy can circumvent the adverse effect of bisulfite treatment to improve the efficiency of TMS (Fig. 1B).We tested the possibility using the biotinylated RNA probes in the Agilent Methyl-Seq kit designed to cover CpG islands with their shores and shelves, enhancers, promoters, differentially methylated regions and other regulatory elements. Our results demonstrated that PBAT enables TMS from a 100-fold smaller amount of input DNA (i.e. 30 versus 3,000 ng) with considerably fewer cycles of PCR amplification (i.e. 4 versus 11–14 cycles) than the original protocol provided by the manufacturer (Table 1; Fig. 2). It also enables PCR-free TMS, provided that 1 µg of input DNA is available. Furthermore, the coverage statistics and the methylation levels of imprinted genes indicated that the PBAT-mediated protocol has superior coverage and accuracy than the original one (Fig. 2). We also confirmed high consistency between PBAT-mediated TMS and WGBS (Fig. 3), proving that the former can serve as a reliable surrogate for the latter. Although further improvements are necessary to generate high-quality TMS libraries from <30 ng of input DNA and to achieve more even coverage of the targets regardless of their GC contents, the PBAT-mediated protocol significantly outperforms the original Methyl-Seq protocol. It will be also useful for base-resolution analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine when applied to genomic DNA treated with adequate oxidants or enzymes.15,16We also evaluated the cost performance of PBAT-mediated TMS in comparison with those of PBAT-mediated WGBS and RRBS. The TMS is ~10 times less expensive than the WGBS, when the former and the latter use the high output mode of HiSeq to achieve 40-fold coverage of the target regions and the whole genome, respectively. Note that, the deeper the coverage is, the more cost effective the TMS is. While the target regions in the TMS cover only ~2.8% of the human genome, they include approximately one-seventh of the total CpG sites. On the other hand, the TMS costs 4–5 times more but covers only ~1.5 times more CpG sites than RRBS does. Nevertheless, the TMS likely remains highly competitive to RRBS in many instances, since the former covers a much broader range of genomic elements than the latter.Taken together, PBAT significantly enhances the utility of TMS to enable various novel applications, especially those analysing a large number of precious samples. The PBAT-mediated TMS will thus serve as an invaluable tool for epigenomics.5.

IntroductionThe onion (Allium cepa) belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae, containing over 300 species; of which, 70 have been cultivated for 4,700 years or more.1 The onion is one of the major vegetable crops in the world. In 2012, onions were grown in 170 countries with global production of 87 million tons (http://faostat.fao.org/). Onions contain outstanding levels of polyphenols, vitamins, and sulphur-containing compounds, which are responsible for their pungency.2–4 Those compounds also affect various aspects of human health, including support for bone and connective tissues, anti-inflammatory effects, diabetes prevention, digestive tract health, and cancer protection.2 Hence, many traits were developed or are under development for onion breeding, including bulb shape, bulb colour, bulb size, flowering time, pungency, nutritional value, and disease resistance.Despite the importance and significance of Allium species as major vegetable crops with nutritional and medicinal values, poor genomic information is available because of the enormous size of the genome (16.3 Gb).5 Although sequencing technologies have advanced rapidly in terms of higher throughput and longer read lengths, analysis of the complex and huge genome of the onion, a non-model plant, has remained a Herculean task.6,7 Currently, only a few information resources on the onion genome are available, including 511 proteins and 20,159 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in GenBank, and those are insufficient for use in molecular breeding. Therefore, alternative sources of genomic information about the onion are required and have begun to be developed through transcriptome sequencing.5High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful and cost-effective tool to determine the structures of whole genes within genomes8–13 as well as to reveal a variety of biological information.14–18 Furthermore, for non-model organisms, it has been feasible to obtain whole transcripts without prior knowledge of a reference genome using de novo transcriptome analysis.19–23 Recent studies reported, however, that most RNA-Seq sequences and assembled transcripts contain various types of sequences such as introns, transposable elements (TEs), and non-coding RNAs, which are unnecessary information for construction of protein-coding genes.16,24–26 In most cases, gene annotation of de novo transcriptome assemblies is performed using ‘a six-frame translation’ approach without considering non-coding sequences.17,27–33 Large groups of non-coding sequences are therefore fully or partially included in the assembled transcripts, creating a potential barrier to accurate gene annotation. Constructing a precise and refined reference transcriptome is a prerequisite for reliability in further studies.To this end, we generated a high-quality de novo assembly of onion transcriptome containing a large, annotated gene set using a standard gene-prediction pipeline by combining reference mapping and ab initio gene models. By validating the data using pre-existing gene sets, we have provided a reliable reference gene set for future genomic and genetic research on Allium spp. Furthermore, our study provides a useful model of a comprehensive approach to high-quality de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation in non-model species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and cDNA library constructionA short-day type, doubled haploid onion with red bulbs (H6) and a lab-derived inbred line (SP3B) were used for cDNA synthesis and sequencing. Six weeks after planting vernalized bulbs, whole seedlings were harvested and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA of each samples were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and quality of extracted RNAs was inspected with Pico RNA chip and Pico6000 RNA reagent (Agilent Technologies) using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Strand-specific RNA-Seq paired-end libraries (insert size of 300–400 bp) were prepared according to the previous protocol,34 and the constructed libraries were used for transcriptome sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000.2.2. De novo transcriptome assemblyThe raw sequences of the onion transcriptome were processed using an in-house preprocessing pipeline to remove unnecessary sequences for the assembly.35 The preprocessing pipeline consisted of four steps. First, contaminating bacterial sequences were filtered out by mapping the reads to reference bacterial genomes in GenBank using Bowtie2 v2.0.0-beta7 (--local -D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.65).36 Secondly, duplicated short reads were removed. Thirdly, low-quality sequences with quality scores below Q20 were eliminated and sequences over 70 bp were remained using an in-house perl script. Finally, rRNA sequences were filtered out using SortMeRNA v1.9 (default parameter).37 The preprocessed sequences from H6 and SP3B and also a combined library of the sequences from both accessions were assembled using Velvet v1.2.0838 (-ins_length 400 -ins_length_sd 200) and Oases v0.2.0639 with a default parameter. To increase the assembly quality, iterative assemblies were performed to identify the k-mer values that gave the optimal total and average transcript lengths for each library. Thus, the optimal read lengths of 49, 47, and 53 bp were selected for the final assembly of H6, SP3B, and the combined library, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).2.3. Structural and functional annotationStructural gene annotation of the transcriptome was performed using the integrated structural gene annotation pipeline (ISGAP; Fig. 1). First, we used the reference gene annotations of monocot plants including Musa acuminata version 1.0,40Oryza sativa RAP version 7.0,41Phyllostachys heterocycla version 1.0,42Sorghum bicolor version 1.0,43 and Brachypodium distachyon version 1.044 to perform protein alignments using Exonerate v2.2.045 with parameters --percent 30 and --maxintron 50,000 to find gene structures within the assembled transcripts. We then merged the detected gene structures which have same exon–exon junctions and constructed consensus sequences to use as initial gene models in the first step. During that process, we removed gene models that included frame shifts and early stop codons as well as remained one of the gene structures, which derived from a larger amount of evidence proteins and have a higher mapping score than other gene models in same regions. In the second step, partial genes in the initial gene models were extended through additional translation based on fixed frame of each gene model starting from five or three prime end of the partial genes to start or end region of the assembled transcript until translation of start or stop codon. In the third step, we constructed a training set of onion gene models using 2,000 of the complete genes generated by the second process, and we then ran Augustus46 using the training set. After filtering the abnormal gene models from Augustus, the initial gene models were integrated into a new gene model by extending the reference proteins without overlap. In the final step, after filtering the resulting gene models against the NR database in GenBank, we determined the final gene models. Integrated structural gene annotation pipeline (ISGAP).

(A) ISGAP based on reference proteins and ab initio prediction. (B) The six-frame translation method as an independent process.For the final gene models, we extracted representative gene models remaining one of the genes, which have a longest complete form existing both start and stop codon in same locus of assembled transcripts. In case of no complete genes in the locus, we selected a longest partial gene as a representative gene model in the locus. The biological functions of the final gene models were assigned using InterProScan version 5-46,47 the plant proteins in the RefSeq database,48 and the Uniprot database,49 which contains the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases with cut-off values e-value over 1e-5.2.4. Evaluation of the predicted gene setsThe gene models predicted by ISGAP and the six-frame translation were validated by aligning the assembled transcripts to both the onion and the plant proteins of the RefSeq database48 in GenBank using Exonerate v2.2.0.45 To obtain accurate gene regions, we applied strict parameters for both validations (--percent 70 and over 90% mapping coverage). All of the correctly aligned regions that allowed redundancy, except for cases where a frame shift and early stop codon were detected, were compared as independent query sequences to the gene models predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation. The gene models were evaluated based on their ability to represent query sequences considering the matched region, strand, and frame.2.5. Sequence variation between the two accessionsA comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed to detect variation between H6 and SP3B. To detect variation, a reference-guided assembly was conducted by mapping the preprocessed raw SP3B sequence data to the H6 assembly via Bowtie2 v2.0.0-beta736 (default parameter) Samtools v0.1.1850 and SNPeff v3.3h51 (-minC 5 -minQ 20) identified sequence variation and classified type of the variation by region of the assembled transcripts. To find more reliable variants, we extracted the sequence variants with their bi-directional 50-mer flanking sequences and confirmed that the sequence variants were detected in the flanking regions of the SP3B assembly using the in-house perl script.3. Results3.1. Sequencing, assembly, and repeat annotationWe obtained 15.0 and 11.6 Gb of whole-transcriptome sequences from H6 and SP3B by Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 101-bp paired-end reads (Supplementary Table S1). After preprocessing, a total of 10.1 and 7.9 Gb of sequences were remained for H6 and SP3B, respectively, and were used for de novo assembly (Supplementary Table S1). Using the combined library, a total of 203.0 Mb were assembled into 165,179 transcripts (mean length = 1,228.9 bp; N50 = 1,756 bp; Supplementary Table S2). The length distribution of the assembly showed that 76,699 transcripts (76.8% of the total) were longer than 1,000 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the assembly of the H6 and SP3B libraries separately produced 108,450 and 94,051 transcripts with an average length of 1,271.2 and 1,211.8 bp, respectively.To validate the three sets of assembled transcripts, we conducted BLASTN using 20,159 onion ESTs downloaded from GenBank, 18,393 (91.2%) of which were detected among the assembled transcripts from the combined library with 98% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, most (83.4%) of the ESTs were represented among the assembled transcripts with at least 98% sequence identity and 80% coverage. Additionally, we confirmed that most of the ESTs were matched and covered by the assemblies of the H6 and SP3B libraries using the same parameters (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C).Prior to structural gene prediction, we performed repeat masking using a constructed de novo repeat library made from the assembly of the combined library. A total of 38.9 Mb (19.2%) of the transcript sequences were determined to be TE-related repeats, including classified and unclassified repeats (Supplementary Table S3). A recent review reported that highly conserved and multicopy genes such as histone and tubulin can be recognized as repeat sequences during repeat masking.8 To avoid missing conserved protein-coding genes, we masked only the classified TEs including long interspersed nuclear elements, short interspersed nuclear elements, and long terminal repeats (LTRs) in the assembly of the combined library. In the assembly of the H6 and SP3B libraries, classified TEs were also masked to achieve optimal gene prediction for each assembly (Supplementary Table S3).3.2. Structural annotationProtein-coding genes in the transcriptome have mostly been predicted by classical methods such as six-frame translation of transcripts.17,27–33 That approach has been controversial, however, because of intermixed intron regions in the transcriptome. In order to predict more reliable gene sets, we established ISGAP to compare and integrate various gene-prediction approaches (Fig. 1). ISGAP comprises various gene-prediction approaches such as six-frame translation, evidence-based gene models based on protein mapping, ab initio gene prediction, and combined gene models.To structurally annotate the genes in the onion transcriptome, protein alignment of the assembled transcripts was carried out to detect gene structures (Fig. 1A). To extend the gene models extracted from the protein alignments using reference genes, we conducted additional translation for partial genes, which have no start or stop positions (Fig. 1A). Thus, 42,435 gene models containing 26,598 complete genes were generated using reference proteins for further analysis (Supplementary Table S4). After the construction of the training set of Augustus,46 51,092 gene models were predicted by Augustus and used to generate combined gene models with the gene models previously produced by Step 2 in ISGAP. Finally, 54,165 total genes and 20,447 representative protein-coding genes were annotated as a reference gene set of the onion after filtering against the NR database (Fig. 1A and Table 1). For the H6 and SP3B assemblies, we performed gene prediction using the same pipeline (Table 1). Additionally, to compare the gene models from ISGAP, six-frame translation was conducted as an independent step, and 65,645 genes were obtained (Fig. 1B and Table 2). The gene sets predicted by ISGAP showed a longer average length than those predicted by six-frame translation (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S4).

Validation and comparison of the gene models from ISGAP and six-frame translationTo evaluate the gene models predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation, we aligned the onion proteins in GenBank to the assembled transcripts. With over 90% mapping coverage, 398 of 511 (77.9%) of the onion proteins were detected among 1,008 regions in the assembled transcripts (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5). As a result, 348 and 281 genes predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively, covered 351 and 344 (88.2 and 86.4%) of the mapped onion proteins with over 99% query coverage. Moreover, 866 and 746 (85.9 and 74.0%) of the mapped regions were represented by the genes predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively (Supplementary Table S5).

For the black dotted line, the left and right of the histogram represent the numbers of covered query sequences and predicted genes, respectively. (A) Validation of the predicted gene sets using 511 onion proteins. (B) Assessment of the predicted proteins against the plant proteins in the RefSeq database.Although the reference onion proteins matched more of the genes predicted by ISGAP than those predicted by six-frame translation, it was difficult to evaluate whole annotated genes because of the small number of known onion proteins in GenBank. To validate the whole genes in the annotated gene sets intensively, we aligned the assembled transcripts to the plant proteins in the RefSeq database.48 A total of 49,257 RefSeq proteins were discovered among 126,607 regions in the assembled transcripts (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). Similar numbers of proteins were detected with over 99% query coverage in both the ISGAP (45,724) and the six-frame translation (44,448) libraries. The numbers of mapped regions and the corresponding genes were different, however, between the ISGAP and six-frame translation libraries (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). The 8,324 genes predicted by ISGAP covered 114,593 (90.5%) of the mapped regions, whereas the 6,526 genes predicted by six-frame translation covered 93,256 (73.7%) of the mapped regions, suggesting that the number of precisely annotated genes in the ISGAP library was substantially higher than that in the six-frame translation library (Fig. 2).To investigate differences between the gene sets, we selected and assessed all cases except both gene sets covered the same mapped regions in the validation results with 99% query coverage (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S5). For the onion reference proteins, 120 and 35 were represented by 94 and 27 gene annotations determined by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively (Fig. 2A). For the RefSeq proteins, 16,373 and 3,393 were represented by 2,341 and 543 gene annotations determined by ISGAP and six-frame translation, respectively (Fig. 2B). Although similar numbers of onion and RefSeq proteins were covered by genes from ISGAP and six-frame translation in the whole validation, the genes predicted by ISGAP in the extracted cases covered higher numbers of onion and RefSeq proteins, due to the fact that the same onion and RefSeq proteins were mapped in a different form on multiple transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S4A).3.4. Assessment of multiple exon genes and annotated gene structuresSome of the onion and RefSeq proteins were mapped as genes containing multiple exons (Supplementary Fig. S4A). To validate those genes, including the multiple exons, we identified the cases where the onion and RefSeq proteins were mapped as genes containing multiple exons in both of the validation results (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S5). In the validation using the onion proteins, 92 proteins were mapped onto 124 of the mapped regions (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S5). For the proteins with over 99% query coverage, 23 genes predicted by ISGAP were represented by 78 (84.8%) of the onion proteins; however, the genes predicted by six-frame translation were not represented by any of the onion proteins (Fig. 2A). Moreover, 14,450 of the RefSeq proteins were detected among 24,719 of the mapped regions. With the same query coverage, 12,904 (89.3%) of the RefSeq proteins were correctly matched by 1,573 of the genes predicted by ISGAP (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). In contrast, only 6 (0.03%) of the RefSeq proteins were correctly matched by three of the genes predicted by six-frame translation (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S5). Rarely, the genes were fully matched to other RefSeq proteins mapped as single-exon genes (Supplementary Fig. S4B).Through the evaluation, we discovered miss-annotated genes derived from the six-frame translation. To verify the reasons for the miss-annotation, we examined the detailed structure of each gene model and identified representative cases among the validation results (Fig. 3). We found that the miss-annotations from the six-frame translation were caused by the retention of introns and the translation of the inappropriate region or strand (Fig. 3). For the corresponding regions, ISGAP successfully performed the gene annotations (Fig. 3). Hence, ISGAP could detect and extract accurate exon regions based on the structure of the reference protein and ab initio gene models, whereas six-frame translation could not. Representative cases of well-annotated genes predicted by ISGAP compared with the genes predicted by six-frame translation.

Functional annotation and transcriptomic variation for the construction of genomic resourcesTo date, the repertory of whole genes in the onion is unknown because of the absence of a reference genome. Therefore, we assigned functional information to the onion transcriptome based on the gene set predicted by ISGAP. We performed functional annotation using InterProScan version 5-46,47 containing Pfam, SMART, ProSite, and GO Term analysis. A total of 27,421 genes (50.6% of the total) were assigned functions based on the definitions of their domains (Supplementary Table S6). Among the annotated genes, the protein kinase domain was the most abundant and was detected in 1,283 genes (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the top 20 domains revealed the most actively expressed gene families in the onion (Fig. 4A). Distribution of biological functions and coverage graph for monocot and dicot plants.

The line graph and histogram illustrate the proportions of onion genes and plant proteins in each species, respectively.To provide a more specific functional description of the onion genes, we conducted a BLAST analysis using the Uniprot database. A total of 44,710 onion genes (82.5% of the total) were discovered based on their best alignment with an e-value cut-off of 1e-5 (Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, using the RefSeq database, we performed additional functional annotations for the genes that were unassigned by the Uniprot database, and a total of 50,352 genes (93.0% of the total) were discovered in Uniprot or RefSeq databases and assigned biological functions (Supplementary Table S6). The same functional annotation was performed for the H6 and SP3B gene sets (Supplementary Table S7 and S8).To estimate the coverage of the gene sets, we compared them to the proteins of each plant species in the RefSeq database via BLAST as an alternative approach to matching them with the whole genes of the onion. The predicted onion gene model covered from 60.5 to 68.0% of monocot proteins (Oryza branchyantha, Brachypodium distachyon, and Zea mays) and from 68.1 to 71.3% of dicot proteins (Vitis vinifera, Cucumis sativus, and Solanum lycopersicum) with cut-offs of 80% coverage and e-value of 1e-10 (Fig. 4B).To build up the genomic resources for molecular marker development in the onion, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis to detect sequence variation between H6 and SP3B. We identified a total 50,064 SNPs and 14,016 InDels between H6 and SP3B (Table 3). For efficient marker development, we removed the SNPs and INDELs that did not have conserved flanking sequences in the assembly of SP3B. Consequently, a total 5,502 SNPs within protein-coding sequences and 5,942 SNPs within non-coding sequences were identified (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S9).

DiscussionSince next-generation sequencing technology was developed, a large number of genomes have been sequenced from various organisms. Plants with very large genome sizes have not been fully sequenced because of features of the next-generation sequencing technology based on short reads. Because of the huge genome size of Allium spp., little genomic information has been deposited, creating an obstacle for the construction of an efficient molecular breeding platform. The emergence of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing offers an attractive solution for genomic studies of non-model organisms including the onion. Despite the advantages of transcriptome sequencing in terms of cost savings and reduced computing requirements, non-coding sequences in de novo transcriptomes have disrupted the construction of accurate genomic resources such as protein-coding gene libraries.25 Therefore, in-depth gene prediction for de novo transcriptome assembly is required to construct a fundamental reference gene set as an alternative genomic resource.Typically, the six-frame translation approach has been used to extract protein-coding genes from de novo transcriptome assemblies. Six-frame translation is based, however, on the concept that assembled transcripts are composed of purified coding sequences, despite the presence of non-coding sequences. We generated de novo transcriptome assemblies with annotated gene sets of two onion accessions using ISGAP, an automated pipeline, with intensive validation. We focused our attention on constructing ISGAP to optimize accurate gene prediction for de novo transcriptome assembly with multiple gene-prediction steps (Fig. 1A). As the key steps of ISGAP, protein alignment was integrated to detect accurate exon regions, and an additional translation step was applied to extend the partial genes based on the detected exon regions (Fig. 1A). In addition, gene prediction using Augustus with a training step was integrated to obtain genes for transcript regions without matching reference proteins (Fig. 1A).ISGAP predicted more genes accurately than six-frame translation did (Fig. 2), and it produced more specifically accurate reference genes (Fig. 2). The differences between the gene sets predicted by ISGAP and six-frame translation were mainly caused by the existence or non-existence of introns within the assembled transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Due to the retained intron sequences, the correct annotation by six-frame translation was interrupted, leading to miss-annotation or the construction of partial genes. For genes containing multiple exons, ISGAP could recognize the intron sequences and merge the exons by removing the introns, despite the protein-coding genes being broken into at least two exons separated by intron sequences in the assembled transcripts (Fig. 3A and B). Six-frame translation could not correctly annotate the genes containing multiple exons (Figs 2 and 3A and B). In addition, for the single-exon genes, six-frame translation often extracted miss-annotated genes by translation with an inappropriate region or strand (Fig. 3C and D). The protein-coding genes in the transcriptome need to be extracted by the consideration of the gene structure, and ISGAP successfully performed annotation based on reference proteins and ab initio gene models.As shown in Fig. 4B, even if accurate comparison between the genes predicted by ISGAP and the plant proteins was difficult due to phylogenetic distance between the onion and the other plants, over 60% of the genes from each plant species were covered by half of the genes predicted by ISGAP with over 80% query coverage, suggesting that the gene set represented a large portion of the genes in the onion genome, although it was not enough to cover all of the genes in the onion. Nevertheless, transcriptome sequencing is still valuable for non-model organisms, owing to the absence of better alternative resources. The gene set predicted by ISGAP will contribute to the construction of a molecular breeding platform for the onion to boost the development of important traits such as shape, colour, size, pungency, and resistance to diseases. In conclusion, we expect that: (i) our comprehensive approach for accurate gene prediction using de novo transcriptome sequencing will provide a standard method for de novo transcriptome assembly in non-model organisms; (ii) the newly annotated gene set of the onion including various genomic resources such as SNPs and InDels will support molecular breeding and gene cloning in Allium spp.5.

IntroductionMicrosatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats, are tandem repeats of 1–6 bp motifs, which are ubiquitously found in eukaryotic genomes. One of the characteristic features of microsatellites is that they undergo rapid expansion or contraction in repeat number, leading to extensive length polymorphisms.1–5 Replication slippage is considered as the major cause of variation of microsatellite repeats.6–8 Slippage error creates a loop in one of the strands that gives rise to an insertion or a deletion in the subsequent replications, depending on the strand specificity (replicating or template strand) of loop formation. This leads to an increase or decrease of repeat length of the microsatellite. Several models have been proposed that explain the mutation processes of microsatellites.8–11 While the stepwise mutation model12 suggests that change in microsatellite loci occurs by one repeat unit at a time, study13 also shows that differential changes in the repeat number of microsatellites are associated with distinct probability under different mutational processes and demographic histories.It is well known that microsatellite loci are associated with an elevated rate of mutation that leads to abundant sequence polymorphisms of the repeats.14,15 Mutation in specific microsatellite loci often creates imperfect motifs,16 and they are generally referred to as imperfect microsatellites. Studies have shown that intra-allelic variability of microsatellites is significantly associated with selective force that maintains microsatellite loci in genome.17–21 In spite of the known facts that repeat variation of microsatellite loci is critical for their maintenance in the genome and in some cases may have functional consequences,18,22 our understanding of motif imperfection in microsatellites is very limited.11 In this study, we aim at understanding genome-wide patterns of motif mismatches among different insect species (n = 20) with a primary objective of investigating the relationship between microsatellite length and motif mismatches, and its role in genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites across species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencesThe genome sequences of insects investigated in this study include 15 species of order Diptera [12 Drosophilidae species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. grimshawi, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis) and 3 Culicidae species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus], 2 species of Hymenoptera (Nasonia vitripennis and Apis mellifera) and 1 species each of Lepidoptera (Bombyx mori), Coleoptera (Tribolium castaneum) and Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon pisum). Moreover, we also selected a few non-insect species, such as the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and the mammalian genomes of mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo sapiens) for specific comparative analyses. In addition, we analysed chromosome X sequences of 29 inbred lines of D. melanogaster from the DGRP (Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel; http://dgrp.gnets.ncsu.edu/) to investigate population-level sequence variation of imperfect microsatellites.The genome sequences of A. aegypti (AaegL1), A. gambiae (AgamP3) and C. quinquefasciatus (CpipJ1) were downloaded from https://www.vectorbase.org/. The genome sequences of the 12 Drosophila species were obtained from FlyBase (www.flybase.org). The assembly version of most of the 12 Drosophila genomes was r1.3 except D. melanogaster (r5.27), D. pseudoobscura (r2.10) and D. virilis (r1.2). The wasp (Nvit_1.0) and honey bee genome (Amel_2.0) sequences were downloaded from http://hymenopteragenome.org/. The aphid (v2.0), silkworm (v2.0) and beetle genome (tacs_superscaffolds v4.0) were obtained from http://www.aphidbase.com/, ftp://silkdb.org/pub/current/Genome/ and ftp://ftp.bioinformatics.ksu.edu/, respectively. The four non-insect genome sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome server (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/currentGenomes/). The assembly versions were yeast (SacCer_Apr2011), roundworm (WS220/ce10), mouse (GRCm38/mm10) and human (hg19, GRCh37). For the insect species, the names have been abbreviated as the first letter of the genus followed by three letters of the species name throughout the text and illustrations.2.2. Identification of imperfect microsatellitesThe imperfect microsatellites were identified from the genome assemblies using the SciRoKo 3.4 program, employing the approach that implemented fixed penalty motif mismatch criteria.23 The minimum score 15 and mismatch penalty 5 were used as search criteria to identify imperfect microsatellites of mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats in each species. We also used slightly different parameters such as a minimum score of 15 and mismatch penalty of 3, and a minimum score of 10 and mismatch penalty of 5 to search microsatellites to investigate whether changes in parameter values affected the results of this study. In none of the searches, more than three consecutive mismatches per locus were allowed to identify the imperfect microsatellites.2.3. Motif mismatches and microsatellite lengthThe number of imperfect microsatellites along with their length and number of mismatches of individual locus, as predicted by SciRoKo, were used for different comparative analyses among the species. The genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites with different length and motif mismatches was chosen for different comparative analyses. First, we targeted microsatellites of length <30 bp for comparison between perfect (no mismatch) and imperfect repeats (each containing exactly one mismatch) in each genome. Here, microsatellites of length 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 bp were identified in genome-wide manner in each species. Note that microsatellites of length <20 bp are not appropriate for this analysis as they are always perfect under our search conditions. Similarly, microsatellites above 25 bp in length may have two mismatches as per our search conditions. Second, we targeted longer microsatellites (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 bp) to compare repeats that have different number (1, 2, 4 or 6) of mismatches. The third comparison was made between microsatellites that were at least 30 bp long and had <3 or =3 mismatches (note that microsatellites <30 bp canno't have more than three mismatches as per our search conditions). Selected non-insect species, such as the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae), the roundworm (C. elegans) and the mammalian genomes of mouse (M. musculus) and human (H. sapiens), were also analysed in genome-wide manner in a similar manner.2.4. Generalized discriminant analysis between perfect and imperfect loci across speciesThe generalized discriminant analysis was performed using the principal coordinates method.24 The variation of frequency of perfect microsatellites and microsatellites that have same number of mismatches across the 20 species were decomposed into the principal coordinates. Then they were tested by permutation to determine if the variation was significant between perfect and imperfect repeats. First, distance matrices were generated separately from the frequency data of both groups of loci across species. They were then decomposed into component eigenvalues by the principal coordinate analysis. The canonical axes scores (position of multivariate points on the canonical axes) were then used to determine correlations between variables, and the statistical significance of the correlation was inferred from permutation procedure implemented in the program named ‘canonical analysis of principal coordinates’ (available at https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~mja/Programs.htm).2.5. Permutational analysis of variance and pair-wise a posteriori comparisonThe permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)25 was used to determine association between the number of mismatches and the length of microsatellites among the 20 species. The Euclidean distance was used as the measure of data variation. The pair-wise a posteriori comparisons were performed between different lengths of microsatellites (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 bp containing 1, 2, 4 or 6 mismatches) among the 20 insect species as well as among the 4 non-insect species using PERMANOVA t-statistic. No data transformation or standardization was done prior to analysis. Unrestricted permutation of the data was allowed to perform the permutation tests (9,999 times) to determine the statistical significance of the analysis. The P-value of <0.05 was considered as the threshold of significance, unless stated otherwise.2.6. Identification and analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms localized within imperfect microsatellitesWe identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are localized within microsatellite loci in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae from the NCBI SNP database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). The microsatellites were partitioned to either as M1 types if the SNP alleles matched to the imperfect motif sequences or as M0 types if SNP alleles did not match to the motif sequences. To determine the significance of association of M0/M1 allelic patterns with variation of motif mismatches of imperfect microsatellites, microsatellites containing either <3 mismatches or =3 mismatches were determined in each species with repeat length being controlled (=30 bp) for each locus. The count data of these four groups of imperfect microsatellites were used in 2 × 2 contingency tests (Yates' chi-square) to determine statistical significance of association between allelic variation and motif imperfection of microsatellites.2.7. Analysis of imperfect microsatellites from DGRP dataTo further investigate the role of mutations in motif mismatches and to estimate the allele age of imperfect microsatellite loci, we analysed genome sequences of D. melanogaster inbred lines from the DGRP data.26 We restricted this analysis only to microsatellite sequences of chromosome X among 29 randomly selected inbred lines. A comprehensive analysis of the microsatellites in the entire DGRP was not an aim of the present study because such a study has been performed earlier.27 Mutations in the microsatellites among the inbred lines were identified by sequence alignment with the reference genome. The imperfect microsatellite data (from DGRP lines) were used as a training dataset to classify the data of imperfect microsatellites generated from the dbSNP by linear regression using Weka Explorer.28The phylogenetic analyses were conducted using D. melanogaster imperfect microsatellite loci from different inbred lines. The sequence of each locus was extended up to 1 kb of both ends of microsatellite and the extended sequences were used to calculate evolutionary distances among the inbred lines using the maximum composite likelihood implemented in MEGA4.29 The neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA4 was used for constructing phylogenetic trees. The total number of mutations, number of polymorphic sites, average number of nucleotide differences and the number of fixed mutations between inbred lines were calculated by using DnaSP v 5.10.30 The allele age of microsatellite SNPs was calculated based on allele frequency and polymorphisms among the inbred lines in the extended sequences of microsatellites by the coalescence method.17 The coalescence times were predicted by using a maximum likelihood approach implemented in the algorithm ‘bdmc21’ (available at http://www.rannala.org/).3. Results3.1. Frequency of imperfect microsatellites in insect genomesThe number of imperfect microsatellites varies among the insect species as given in Table 1. The imperfect repeats account to ~15–46% of all simple sequence repeats identified from the genome sequences of the 20 insect species. The imperfect microsatellites represented <1% of the genome size of most of these insects except few Drosophila species (Fig. 1). The data in Table 1 and Fig. 1 show that species even within the Drosophila genus have extensive variation in the frequency of imperfect microsatellites. It was observed that specific Drosophila species (such as D. mojavensis, D. virilis and D. grimshawi) have a higher amount of imperfect microsatellites than other insects. Moreover, our data show that the imperfect microsatellites are differentially distributed among different chromosomes within the genome (Supplementary Table S1). This was evident in insects where chromosomes have been annotated from genome assemblies. It was observed that chromosome X harbours the highest proportion of imperfect microsatellites in D. melanogaster, a pattern that was also found in D. simulans and D. yakuba. However, this pattern is missing in non-Drosophila insects such as A. gambiae and T. castaneum (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, the proportion of imperfect microsatellites varies differentially among species depending on the motif length of microsatellites (Supplementary Table S2). The di- and trinucleotide repeats are associated with an elevated rate of motif mismatches compared with all other repeat sizes. Moreover, this pattern seems to be a conserved feature across the insect genomes.

Motif mismatches and microsatellite lengthThe mean length of imperfect microsatellites is higher than that of perfect microsatellites in each species (Supplementary Table S3). To understand the relationship between microsatellite length and motif imperfection, we identified microsatellites of different lengths (20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 bp) that either lack mismatch (perfect motifs) or have exactly one mismatch in each locus. The generalized discriminant analysis24 was conducted to determine the significance of variation between perfect and imperfect microsatellites across the genomes. Results of this analysis showed a significant relationship (first squared canonical correlation = 0.9024, P = 0.0001) between perfect and imperfect microsatellites among the species, wherein the imperfect microsatellites of different lengths revealed lower canonical variation than that of the perfect microsatellites in each species (Fig. 2).

The scatter graph on the right shows the canonical variation of frequency of microsatellites of different length for each species. The species are indicated as 1 through 20 on x-axis and the canonical variation is shown in y-axis.Then to know if the extent of motif mismatches is related to microsatellite length, we determined the frequency of microsatellites of different lengths (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 bp) harbouring different numbers of mismatches (1, 2, 4 and 6) in each of 20 species (Supplementary Table S4). The length and mismatch criteria were selected based on the search parameters as described above. The dataset was then used to perform permutational multifactorial analysis of variance of mismatch numbers and length of microsatellites. Results of this analysis showed that both the factors (length and mismatches) have significant association with the variation of genomic frequency of microsatellites among the species (F = 2.6, P = 0.02 for length and F = 45.02, P = 0.001 for mismatch). This suggested that genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites may have an evolutionary link with the extent of sequence heterogeneity of repeat motifs across species. Moreover, it was also observed that genomic frequency of the microsatellites having only one mismatch correlates better with that of loci harbouring two mismatches than loci having four or six mismatches (Table 2). This again supported for a possible link between genomic frequency and extent of motif imperfection of microsatellites. Pearson correlation of frequency of imperfect microsatellites.

The microsatellite lengths are shown in bp in the first column. The frequencies of microsatellites having 1 mismatch are compared with that of microsatellites having 2, 4 or 6 mismatches among the 20 insect species3.3. Motif heterogeneity and genomic abundance of microsatellitesTo further understand the relationship between motif heterogeneity and genomic abundance of microsatellites, we performed the following analyses. First, we calculated the expected number of mismatches in each imperfect microsatellite from the average rate of per-site mismatch (sum of mismatches divided by the sum of loci lengths) in individual genomes. Then for each imperfect microsatellite, the expected number of mismatches (repeat length multiplied with per-site mismatches) was calculated and compared with the observed number of mismatches in the loci. The results of this comparison showed that microsatellites that carry a higher amount of mismatches than expected are significantly related (Spearman r = 0.938, df = 19, P = 0.000001) with microsatellites that carry a lower amount of mismatches than expected across the species (Table 3). The former group of microsatellites consistently showed lower frequency in the genome than the latter group, indicating that genomic frequency of microsatellites is negatively influenced by motif heterogeneity of the repeats. Number of microsatellites where motif mismatches are either higher or lower than the expected values of mismatches in different insect genomesNumber of microsatellites where motif mismatches are either higher or lower than the expected values of mismatches in different insect genomesTo further confirm that genomic abundance of microsatellites is associated with motif mismatches of microsatellites, we performed PERMANOVA25 test among different groups of motif mismatches (1, 2, 4 and 6 mismatches) of microsatellites among species (Supplementary Table S4). The results of this analysis revealed that the relationship between higher mismatches and lower genomic abundance of microsatellites is statistically significant (P = 0.0001). The pair-wise a posteriori comparison between microsatellites of different lengths showed that the significance level of association of genomic abundance varies differentially across the insect species based on the length of microsatellites (Supplementary Table S4). These results clearly suggested that microsatellite abundance in genome is intricately related to sequence imperfection of motifs and the length of the microsatellites across species.We also compared microsatellites by controlling the length and number of motif mismatches of microsatellites across the species. Here, we restricted the comparison among loci that are at least 30 bp in length and have either <3 or =3 mismatches. These length and mismatch criteria were selected based on our search parameters as described in the Materials and methods section. The result of this analysis also revealed that loci that have less than three mismatches are more prevalent in the genome than those with three or more number of mismatches (Supplementary Table S5). This pattern was consistent not only in the insect species, but also in other unrelated species such as yeast, roundworm, mouse and human (Supplementary Table S5).We also wanted to confirm that our observations were not influenced by the search parameters we used to identify the microsatellites. To test that, we used different parameters such as minimum score 15 and mismatch penalty 3 or minimum score of 10 and mismatch penalty 5 to search microsatellites in specific genomes. When data of these searches were used to repeat the analyses described above, we still found that microsatellites with higher mismatches tend to have lower prevalence in the genome (data not shown). This confirmed that the link between sequence imperfection and microsatellite abundance is a robust evolutionary process and is not influenced by the search parameters of microsatellites.3.4. Mutation and imperfection of motif sequencesTo investigate role of mutation in motif imperfection, SNPs localized within microsatellite loci were identified from the dbSNP database (see Materials and methods). Then, we identified loci where motif mismatches corresponded to the alternate alleles of the cognate SNP (Fig. 3). These were referred to as M1 microsatellites. We also found microsatellites where motif mismatches did not correspond to the SNP alleles (Fig. 3). These were referred to as M0 microsatellites. The microsatellites with different numbers of mismatches (=3 or <3 mismatches) and having either M0 or M1 allele patterns were identified in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae (Supplementary Table S6). The number of mismatches (=3 or <3) was particularly chosen as 1) microsatellites <30 bp in length are predominant in both genomes, and 2) loci that are <30 bp have less than three mismatches as per our search conditions. The count data of microsatellites, based on the number of motif mismatches and pattern of allelic variation (M0 or M1), were analysed by Yates' chi-squared test. The result of this analysis revealed significant (<U+03C7>2 = 315.5, P < 0.0001) association between allele sequences of SNPs and mismatch patterns of microsatellites in D. melanogaster. A similar result was observed in A. gambiae where the association was also statistically significant (<U+03C7>2 = 13.6, P = 0.0002). Taken together, these findings show that patterns of allelic changes of microsatellites have a significant role in modulating the number of motif mismatches of imperfect microsatellites.

Insights from population dataWe also analysed sequences of imperfect microsatellites of multiple inbred lines (n = 29) of D. melanogaster (DGRP data) to understand within-species variation of motif sequences of imperfect microsatellite loci. We identified a total of 118,446 imperfect microsatellites from the chromosome X sequences of the 29 inbred lines of D. melanogaster (Supplementary Table S7). Of these, a total of 1,025 loci showed polymorphic microsatellites (Fig. 4). We used the allele sequences and motif mismatch patterns of these 1,025 microsatellites to train the imperfect microsatellites identified from dbSNP data. Linear regression-based data classification of SNP allelic variation (M0 versus M1) and the corresponding motif mismatch patterns of microsatellites were performed using Weka3.6.28 The results of these analyses revealed a significant relationship (P < 0.05) between allele variation and motif mismatches of imperfect microsatellites, and also showed that for accumulation of a single M1 type of mutation, the number of repeat mismatches in the microsatellite decreases by 56%. This further confirmed that pattern of allelic variation plays a major role in motif heterogeneity of microsatellites.

The reference SNP identified in D. melanogaster (dbSNP data) is shown by a downward arrow along with SNP ID and alleles.We also estimated the age of specific alleles of imperfect microsatellites based on the population data (DGRP). First, we identified flanking mutations (within 1 kb on both ends) of microsatellites that were in complete linkage with segregating mutation within the microsatellite (Supplementary Fig. S1). Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis, the extended sequences showed differential genealogical relations among the inbred lines (Fig. 5). We determined the number of fixed mutations, total number of variable sites and the average number of nucleotide differences in the extended sequences of imperfect microsatellites (Supplementary Table S8). Based on the allele frequency of mutations within and the flanking sequences of the imperfect microsatellite, we predicted generation times that might have lapsed since the origin of the mutation in the microsatellite. The maximum likelihood method17 was used for making this prediction from the joint distribution of the number of copies in the population and the coalescence times of the intra-allelic variation. The results revealed that the maximum likelihoods varied between 1,380 and 1,530 generations (Fig. 6). Assuming 36 days as the average generation time of D. melanogaster, it was thus estimated that these alleles might have arisen 136–150 yrs ago.

DiscussionThe results obtained from this study provide insights into sequence imperfection of microsatellite motifs in a genome-wide manner. We chose insect genomes for this investigation as microsatellites have been extensively exploited as molecular markers in ecology and population studies of numerous insect species,31 yet the imperfect microsatellites of insects remain poorly understood. As studies on evolution of microsatellites are gaining renewed attention with the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing and whole-genome sequences,32–39 the present study was initiated as an effort to gain insights into the motif mismatch patterns of microsatellites of insects as well as specific non-insect eukaryotes. In this investigation, imperfect microsatellites were computationally identified from the draft genome sequences of the chosen species by SciRoko.23 Apart from SciRoKo, other computational algorithms such as IMEx, NWISL and Phobos are also available to identify imperfect microsatellites40 (http://ssr.nwisrl.ars.usda.gov/ and www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ecoevo/cm/cm_phobos.htm). However, comparing the efficacy of different algorithms in detecting imperfect microsatellites was not the aim of this study. We analysed each genome using the same tool (SciRoKo) and the same parameters appropriate for data comparison across genomes. The genome-wide search of microsatellites in insect species by SciRoKo revealed that the proportion of microsatellites with imperfect motifs varies from species to species even within the same genus. The 12 Drosophila species clearly represent that pattern (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Earlier study has shown that microsatellite abundance diverges rapidly between Drosophila species, and that considerable variation in the relative abundance of motif size classes exists between species.41 Moreover, differential association of microsatellites with coding sequences of Drosophila genome may impose differential constraint on microsatellite abundance between species. In fact, the number of microsatellites associated with coding sequences varies extensively among the 12 Drosophila genomes as shown from the previous study.36 At the same time, it is possible that the quality of genome assembly may affect identification of microsatellites comprehensively. However, the 20 insect genomes we analysed represented different qualities of genome assemblies of the insect species. Yet, our results showed highly consistent patterns in microsatellite imperfections across species (Supplementary Table S4), indicating that the results of this study are not affected by differences in assembly quality of the genomes.We found that sex chromosomes tend to have elevated frequency of imperfect microsatellites than autosomes in Drosophila species. It is likely that differential association of microsatellites with coding sequences of different chromosomes may impose differential constraint on non-random prevalence of imperfect microsatellites within the genome. These coding repeats may be under differential selection pressure in the genome. It is known that repeats representing amino acid runs in Drosophila are under positive selection.34 Furthermore, in D. melanogaster, the adaptive evolution proceeds more quickly in X than autosomes.42 This is commonly referred to as the faster-X hypothesis. Such X bias adaptive evolution is associated with a number of phenotypic, morphological and behavioural changes in the fly.43 As sex chromosomes in Drosophila have elevated frequency of imperfect microsatellites than autosomes, the possibility of coding microsatellites playing a role in faster X evolution of Drosophila genome canno't be ruled out. Furthermore, our earlier study has shown that the trinucleotide repeats represent the highest fraction of codon repeats in insects.36 From the current study, we also observe that trinucleotide microsatellites show higher variation in motif imperfect than other motif sizes in several insects including D. melanogaster (Supplementary Table S2). It is likely that rapid variation of codon repeats in chromosome X may cause faster adaptive evolution of genes localized in X chromosome than autosomes. However, it is unlikely that such a mechanism is operational in all insect species. This is because no evidence of elevated frequency of imperfect microsatellites in chromosome X compared with autosomes was observed in the non-Drosophila species we investigated.We further observed that microsatellite length and the extent of motif imperfection are significantly associated with the genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites. Previously, it has been shown that longer microsatellites (>15 repeats) are associated with mutational bias that reduces the length of microsatellites.44 Hence, the older mutations are more likely to be deleted from the longer microsatellites, causing a paucity of long microsatellites in the genome. Although the length of microsatellites is known to have a role in the mutational activities of microsatellites,45,46 results from the current investigation show that sequence imperfection of motifs is a key determinant of abundance of imperfect microsatellites in the genome. Such an evolutionary link is not specific to insects, but is also observed in unrelated eukaryotes including yeast, worm and mammals. Consistent with this theory, the perfect microsatellites are found more abundantly than the imperfect microsatellites in each genome (Table 1). Moreover, it is known that mutations in microsatellite alleles shorter than a critical length favour repeat expansion, whereas mutations acting on longer alleles favour contraction of microsatellite repeats.47 The intricacies between length and sequence mismatches may also be critical in maintaining imperfect repeats in the genome.21 This is also indicated from comparison of genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites among insect species based on different lengths of microsatellites (Supplementary Table S4). The posterior t-test P-values were significant for all the pair-wise comparisons among the 20 insect species. We, however, failed to observe such relationships among the non-insect species most probably due to the sample size (only four) used for analysis. Also, the large differences in the genome sequences of these species (worm, yeast, human and mouse) may account for the lack of significant relationships in imperfect microsatellites in the genomes.Recently, many inbred lines of D. melanogaster were sequenced that generated a very useful resource of genetic variation data of fruit fly, and also provided new insights on the faster X hypothesis.26 We used these data to identify imperfect microsatellites in multiple inbred lines. The data were used to classify the reference SNP alleles (dbSNP data) of imperfect microsatellites to understand how mutation affects sequence imperfection in microsatellites. The results of that analysis suggested that there is a significant relationship between motif imperfection and mutational patterns in the microsatellite loci. Our data showed that the extent of motif heterogeneity of imperfect microsatellites is significantly linked to the nature of allelic changes in microsatellites. When a new allele is introduced that differs in sequence from that of existing mismatches in the microsatellite, the extent of sequence heterogeneity increases. On the other hand, when the introduced alleles match to the pre-existing motif mismatches, it does no't affect the motif heterogeneity for which the locus is more likely to be maintained in the genome than a locus where motif heterogeneity builds up by mutation. If mutations continue in a microsatellite wherein the introduced alleles build up motif heterogeneity, over time the locus eventually becomes a non-microsatellite sequence. Our result shows that, depending on the introduced allele sequences, a single mutation can reduce motif mismatches by 56%. It is plausible that this relationship may be instrumental in regulating the overall slippage events of simple sequence repeats in the genome.In D. melanogaster, we further observed that imperfect microsatellites are also localized within specific protein-coding genes (Fig. 5). The microsatellite-associated SNP rs204392359 is localized in the intron of gene stardust (sdt). Similarly, the SNP rs205546548 is localized within a microsatellite in downstream region of gene trf2 (TATA box-binding protein-related factor 2), and the SNP rs204306547 is localized within an intronic microsatellite of the gene CG3655. Furthermore, we estimated that alleles of these microsatellites originated within the last 150 yrs, suggesting that these imperfect microsatellites may be undergoing recent mutations in D. melanogaster. It is possible that these imperfect microsatellite and the associated mutations have a functional role in D. melanogaster, as increasing evidence now suggests that microsatellites are associated with functional and evolutionary roles in eukaryotic genomes.14,48 Moreover, in A. gambiae genome, numerous protein-coding genes harbour mutation in microsatellite sequences within the respective genes (Supplementary Table S9), indicating that motif imperfection of microsatellites may have extensive functional consequences in A. gambiae.In conclusion, the current study is the first detailed investigation of imperfect microsatellites in insect species representing five taxonomic orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera). The results obtained from this investigation provide new insights into the evolution of sequence imperfection in microsatellite loci across genomes. The outcome of this study may have utility in assessing the role of motif imperfection of microsatellites in genome structure and function of insects.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.orgFundingThis work was supported from grants RO1-AI079125-A1, RO1-AI081795 and R21-AI101345 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, USA.

IntroductionGenetic linkage maps are essential for the understanding of genomic levels of organization of inheritance of traits.1 Construction of high-density and high-resolution genetic maps is a key step for fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and marker-assisted selection. In addition, genetic linkage maps are valuable resources for the generation of chromosome-level assembly of whole-genome sequences and for comparative genome analysis.2 In most of the recent whole-genome sequencing cases, whole-genome sequences are generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Short sequence reads are assembled into contigs. Such contigs are generally still relatively short although they vary in sizes from several kilobases to tens of kilobases. Increases in genome sequencing coverage and sequencing libraries can increase the quality of the assembly, allowing the sizes of contigs to be increased. However, NGS methods alone cannot provide the resources to assemble complex genomes at the chromosomal level. Genome sequence assemblies at this level require the assembly of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of contigs.Highly segmented genome assemblies prohibit efficient genome analysis. Therefore, various genome resources have been created to reduce the segmentation of the genome assemblies. One of these resources is the large-insert-based physical maps. Historically, several types of large insert libraries have been used. These include yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs),3 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs),4 and cosmid-based libraries.5 YACs have the largest capacity for cloning the large inserts, but they are relatively unstable; therefore, their use in genome studies has been limited. Cosmid libraries have the smallest capacity for cloning the large inserts; therefore, their use in large insert libraries has also been limited. BACs are the most popular large insert libraries as they are stable and can hold inserts of up to 200 kb. BAC-based physical maps can organize the entire genome into restriction fingerprint-based contigs. Such contigs are similar to the whole-genome sequencing contigs, but they are constructed using overlapping restriction enzyme fingerprints rather than overlapping sequences themselves for the whole-genome sequence assemblies. By analysis of restriction fingerprints of overlapping genomic clones of BAC inserts, the whole genome can be organized into a limited number of contigs, most often in thousands. For instance, the catfish physical maps had 3,307 contigs and 1,891 contigs.6,7 The integrated catfish physical map included over 2,500 contigs (unpublished).Integration of physical maps and whole-genome sequence contigs allows the relationship to be established between the sequence-based contigs and the restriction fingerprint-based contigs, thereby reducing the levels of segmentation of the genome. One of the major applications of genetic linkage map is to integrate physical maps and whole-genome assemblies. Integration of genetic map with physical map is useful for understanding genomes from different dimensions and is essential for comparative genome analysis,8 fine-scale QTL mapping and positional cloning of genes responsible for performance and production traits.9,10 In aquaculture fish species, genetic maps have been constructed in a few species, such as Asian seabass,11 Atlantic salmon,12 half-smooth tongue sole,13 rainbow trout,14 common carp,15 and catfish.2,9,16,17 These maps harbour several hundred to a couple of thousands of markers, with which QTL for agriculturally important performance and production traits can only be mapped in large genomic regions.Integrated maps have been developed in several aquaculture fish species using low-density genetic maps. In Atlantic salmon, in addition to 579 BAC contigs that were integrated into the linkage map using microsatellite markers, identification and mapping of new BAC-anchored single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from BAC-end sequences placed 73 additional BAC contigs to Atlantic salmon linkage groups.18 The second generation of rainbow trout integrated map anchored up to 265 contigs to the genetic map, covering ~11% of the genome.10 In common carp, a total of 463 physical map contigs and 88 single BACs were integrated into the genetic linkage map, which covered 30% of the common carp genome.15 In catfish, 2,030 BAC-end sequence (BES)-derived microsatellites from 1,481 physical map contigs were used for linkage map construction, which anchored 44.8% of the catfish BAC physical map contigs, covering ~52.8% of the genome.9 Apparently, the level of integration is dependent on the density and resolution of the genetic maps.One objective of this study was to construct a high-density and high-resolution genetic linkage map by using a large number of molecular markers, covering the entire genome and a large resource panel for linkage mapping analysis. In addition to this primary goal, a secondary goal was to increase integration of the linkage and physical maps, using markers derived from BECs for genetic linkage analysis. Our previous genetic linkage analysis used mostly microsatellite markers. In spite of their high polymorphism, and low cost of single marker genotyping, an analysis of tens of thousands of microsatellites with a large number of mapping fish is extremely labourious and cost-prohibitive. SNPs overcome these difficulties by providing high efficiency and low-cost, large-scale genotyping. SNPs have become markers of choice because of their abundance, even genomic distribution, and easy adaptation to automation.19 Recent advances in NGS have allowed rapid discovery of genome-wide SNPs in any organism in a cost-effective manner.20 With the availability of large numbers of SNPs, high-density SNP array platform can be developed for high-throughput and efficient genotyping. Alternatively, an NGS-based genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)19–21 is also highly efficient. SNP arrays and GBS have both been used to genotype large-scale SNPs for genetic mapping and association analyses.12,22–28 Compared with GBS, SNP arrays are more cost-effective. In addition, they provide a greater level of genome coverage. For instance, in most cases, the total number of commonly analysed SNPs is limited to several thousands while millions of SNPs can be analysed by using very high-density SNP arrays. In addition, GBS of large resource panels for high-resolution maps is cost-prohibitive.Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, is the primary aquaculture species in the United States. Since the initiation of genome research over two decades ago, several genetic maps have been constructed with different types of molecular markers and various resource families.2,9,16,17 Up to date, the highest density map was developed to contain 2,030 microsatellites and 100 SNPs.9 Although this genetic map has been very useful for genetic and genomic analysis,29,30 marker density in this map was still fairly low and only facilitated integration to the physical map for ~52% of catfish genome. Recently, following efforts to expand catfish genomic resources, we have identified millions of SNPs in channel catfish31,32 and developed high-density SNP arrays,33 which provided the opportunity to develop a high-density and high-resolution SNP-based genetic map. Here we report the construction of genetic linkage map with over 50,000 SNPs in channel catfish, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest density genetic map for any aquaculture species. Along with the high density of markers, the utilization of BAC-associated SNPs also allowed significant increase of the integration of the genetic linkage map with the BAC-based physical map in catfish, allowing over 90% of the catfish genome physical map contigs to be mapped to linkage groups. This genetic map should serve as a valuable framework for validating the reference whole-genome sequences, extensive comparative and functional genomic studies, and fine-scale QTL mapping and association studies in catfish.2. Materials and methods2.1. Resource families and DNA preparationA total of 576 fish, with 192 full-sibling individuals from each of three full-sibling channel catfish families, were used for linkage mapping. The parent and grandparent samples were also obtained. All DNAs for these samples used in this study were provided by USDA-ARS Warmwater Aquaculture Research Unit, which were prepared following the procedures as previously described.172.2. SNP genotypingDNA samples were arranged in 96-well microtitre plates and diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/µl with the final volume of 10 µl. Genotyping was conducted by GeneSeek (Lincoln, NE, USA) using the catfish 250K SNP array.33 Affymetrix CEL files were analysed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software (version 4.0) for quality control analysis and SNP genotype calling using the Affymetrix AxiomGT1 algorithm. Samples passing the quality control (Dish value > 0.85) and SNP call rates threshold (>95%) were retained for analysis. Following genotyping, an R package, SNPolisher, was used to generate the genotyping outputs. The package produced SNP quality control metrics and divided SNPs into several classes based on the quality of genotype calls.33 The polymorphic markers with high resolution of cluster separation (high genotyping quality) were remained for further analysis. The CHP files generated from the Affymetrix Genotyping Console were imported into SNP & Variation Suite (SVS version 7, Golden Helix, Inc.) for further filtering to remove SNPs with missing genotypes >10% and minor allele frequency <5%.2.3. Linkage map constructionOnly SNPs that had high quality of genotype calls and were heterozygous in at least one parent were retained for linkage analysis. Based on segregation patterns, SNPs were categorized into three types: 1 : 2 : 1 type (AB × AB, segregating in both parents), 1 : 1 type (AB × AA or AB × BB, segregating only in female), and 1 : 1 type (AA × AB or BB × AB, segregating only in male). The <U+03C7>2 goodness-of-fit tests were performed to examine the segregation distortion. Markers with significant segregation distortion were excluded (P < 0.001).Linkage maps were initially developed independently for the three mapping families. Sex-specific maps were constructed for each parent using 1 : 1 segregation-type markers only (AB × AA or AB × BB for female map and AA × AB or BB × AB for male map). The markers of segregation type 1 : 2 : 1 (AB × AB) were used to build the sex-averaged map. The LINKMFEX software (version 2.4, http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rdanzman/software.htm) was used to perform linkage analysis for sex-specific markers, and OneMap (R package, version 2.0) was used for linkage analysis of sex-averaged markers. Linkage between markers was examined by estimating logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for recombination fraction (<U+03B8>). A LOD threshold of 8.0 was used, and a maximum <U+03B8> of 0.35 was set to assign markers into linkage groups.For markers falling into ‘zero recombination clusters', only one marker was picked that had the most informative meiosis as the representative marker of each cluster for linkage map construction to reduce the power required for computation of linkage. Genetic maps were constructed using JoinMap software version 4.0 with the regression mapping algorithm.34 The Kosambi mapping function was used to convert the recombination frequencies into map distances (centiMorgans). The positions of markers were determined according to the sequential build-up of the map.35 Briefly, a pair of markers was firstly selected, followed by sequential addition of other markers. The ‘ripple’ was performed each time after adding one marker. The best fitting position of the added markers was searched based on the goodness-of-fit test for the resulting map. When a marker generated a negative map distance or a large ‘jump’ value in goodness-of-fit test, the marker was removed, and map calculation was continued to construct a first-round map. Thereafter, the removed markers were added to the first-round map and again subjected to the goodness-of-fit test to generate an optimum order of markers. For the sex-specific markers, the linkage phases were inferred automatically, while for the markers with 1 : 2 : 1 segregation type (AB × AB), the linkage phase was deduced based on the genotypes of grandparents to assist the map construction.The consensus maps were then established using the MergeMap36 by integrating individual maps from three reference families through shared markers. Lastly, the markers falling into ‘zero recombination clusters’ that were excluded during map construction were anchored to the linkage map, based on the positions of their corresponding representative markers. All genetic linkage maps were drawn using MAPCHART 2.2.372.4. Differences in recombination rates between families and sexesTo investigate sex-specific heterogeneity throughout each linkage group, common marker pairs were used to compare the locus intervals across the male-specific map and female-specific map using contingency G-test.392.5. Integration of linkage map with physical mapTo integrate previously developed physical map40 with the high-density linkage map constructed in the present work, all the mapped SNPs with 70-bp flanking sequences were aligned with BES8,40 and BAC-based physical map contig-specific sequences (PMCSS)41 using BLAST with the E-value cut-off 1E-10, minimal alignment length of 36, and minimal identity of 95%. The relationship of physical map and genetic map was built up based on the SNP-associated BES and PMCSS. The BAC physical map contigs that harboured BAC-derived BES and PMCSS were anchored onto the genetic map based on the SNP positions.3. Results3.1. Selection of SNP markersAs summarized in Table 1, SNP genotypes were obtained from 576 samples of three mapping families (192 samples per family). According to the assessment of genotyping quality and polymorphism in all samples from the three mapping families, genotypes of a total of 121,521 SNPs were used (Table 1). Owing to the low genotype calling rate (<95%), nine individuals were excluded for analysis, including one individual from family 1, three individuals from family 2, and five individuals from family 3. After further filtering to remove SNPs with low calling rate (<97%) and non-Mendelian inheritance (P < 0.001), a total of 18,866 SNPs from family 1, 33,224 SNPs from family 2, and 35,093 SNPs from family 3 were retained for linkage mapping. Taken together, a total of 64,889 SNPs that were informative in at least one of the three mapping families were used. SNPs selected for linkage mappingSNPs selected for linkage mapping3.2. Linkage mappingLinkage maps were first constructed for each of the three families, separately. For all three mapping families, 29 linkage groups (LGs) were obtained, which was consistent with the number of chromosomes of the catfish haploid genome. The consensus genetic linkage maps were obtained by merging separate maps from three mapping families. A total of 31,387 markers with distinct genetic positions (hereafter referred to as unique markers) were placed on the consensus linkage maps, which included 8,644 SNPs from family 1, 13,477 SNPs from family 2, and 14,343 SNPs from family 3 (Table 2). After anchoring the previously excluded markers that fell into ‘zero recombination clusters’ based on the genetic positions of representative markers, a total of 54,342 SNP markers were placed onto the current linkage map (Table 2). SNPs placed on the linkage mapsSNPs placed on the linkage mapsThe sex-specific maps were constructed using markers that were heterozygous in only female or male parent. The female genetic map consisted of 18,444 SNPs including 9,746 unique markers, with a total genetic length of 4,495.1 cM (Table 3; Fig. 1). The marker intervals estimated based on the unique marker positions ranged from 0.37 cM/marker pair in LG12 to 0.7 cM/marker pair in LG18 with the average marker interval of 0.46 cM/marker pair in female genetic map. The male genetic map comprised 15,148 SNPs with 7,250 unique markers and a total genetic length of 2,593.7 cM, which was much shorter than female genetic map. The marker intervals of male genetic map ranged from 0.25 cM/marker pair (LG18) to 0.55 cM/marker pair (LG1), with an average marker interval of 0.36 cM (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be noted that these distances refer to intervals where recombination was detected and of course it should be recognized that in both sexes, the minimum distance observed was 0 cM for completely linked markers. The female- and male-specific maps are illustrated in Figs 1 and 2, respectively. The detailed map information was provided in Supplementary data S1.

The sex-averaged map spanned 3,505.4 cM with an average marker interval of 0.22 cM, ranging from 0.17 cM/marker (LG12) to 0.30 cM/marker (LG18). The genetic map is illustrated in Fig. 3.

Analysis of recombination ratesWithin each linkage group, mild to strong localized specific recombination patterns were observed, whereby recombination rates were usually elevated towards the end and suppressed in the middle of the map (Fig. 4). Clustered markers that fell into ‘zero recombination rate’ were observed in every linkage group, especially in positions close to the centromeres in contrast to the telomeres (Supplementary data S1). The patterns of localized regional recombination rates along each linkage group.The patterns of localized regional recombination rates along each linkage group.There is no significant difference in recombination rate among three mapping families based on the examination with common marker pairs among the three families (see Methods section). In contrast, significant higher recombination rates were observed in a majority of the linkage groups of the female genetic map than that of male genetic map (P < 0.01). Overall, the female genetic map was 1,901.4 cM longer than male genetic map, with an average female-to-male ratio of 1.7 : 1 (Table 3). The ratio varied by linkage groups, ranging from 0.97 : 1 in LG22 to 2.50 : 1 in LG1 (Table 3). The largest differences in recombination rate between the female and male maps were observed in LG1, LG5, LG7, LG18, LG27, and LG29. Across all these linkage groups, the female : male recombination ratios exceeded 2.0. LG22 was unusual in that recombination rates were very similar between the sexes (i.e. 0.97 : 1). Within unique map positions, 504 SNPs were commonly shared between the two sexes, while significantly higher recombination rates were observed in majority of the common locus intervals (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5). Comparison of the recombination rate between female and male. The inter-marker distances (cM) for all pairs of adjacent markers from both female- and male-specific maps were used.

Integration and validation with physical mapThe integration of the genetic map with the BAC-based physical map anchored 2,728 (83%) of the 3,307 physical map contigs (Table 5). Together with the 1,481 (44.8%) physical map contigs that were anchored previously,6 we were able to anchor a total of 2,880 (87.1%) physical map contigs consisting of 28,416 BAC clones (92.9% of total BAC clones). The sizes of anchored physical map contigs varied from 66.0 kb to 2,005.8 kb (Supplementary data S2), with an average size of 301 kb. Together, a total of 867.4 Mb of the physical map was integrated by genetic linkage map that accounted for ~90% of the channel catfish genome (Table 5). Detailed information regarding integration of linkage map and physical map is provided in Supplementary data S2. Integration of channel catfish linkage map with physical mapData obtained from Xu et al.6Data obtained from Ninwichian et al.9Integration of channel catfish linkage map with physical mapData obtained from Xu et al.6Data obtained from Ninwichian et al.9The integration of linkage map and physical map enabled the cross-validation of the quality of the physical map and the genetic map (Table 6). A total of 1,467 physical map contigs containing 2,961 BES-associated SNPs were placed onto linkage maps. With 615 physical map contigs, two or more SNP markers were mapped that allowed the determination of orientation of the physical map contigs along the chromosome. With such contigs, the quality of physical map contigs was assessed based on the mapped markers. An illustration with linkage group 12 is provided in Fig. 6. The vast majority of physical contigs were validated, but a small fraction of physical map contigs was found incorrectly assembled, or the ordering of the SNP markers onto the map was in error.

The linkage group 12 (LG12) was used for the illustration. Vertical bars represent physical map contigs containing at least two SNPs mapped onto the linkage map, and the dot spots indicate physical map contigs with only one SNP.A total of 47 physical map contigs had markers that were mapped in different linkage groups, indicating the potential errors of the physical map assembly or the mapping errors of incorrectly assigned SNPs. These errors could be caused by SNPs falling into duplicated regions of genome. Moreover, of the 2,707 BAC clones with BES-associated SNPs, 238 BAC clones contained at least two BES-associated SNPs. Within this group, 7 BAC clones were mapped onto different LGs, suggesting the misplacement of those SNP markers onto the linkage groups. As an illustration, the integration of sex-averaged linkage map with physical map Contig72 and Contig534 is shown in Fig. 7, presenting the correct and incorrect physical map assembly, respectively. The manual check of the potential assembly or mapping error warrants the correctness of both physical map and linkage map in the next step. Example of validation of physical map using the linkage map.

(A) shows the correct physical map contig using Contig72 as an example; (B) shows the incorrect physical map contig using Contig534 as an example.Physical distances were estimated based on the position of SNP markers within each physical map contig, which allowed for estimation of the ratios of physical distance to genetic distance (Supplementary data S3). On the other hand, recombination frequencies can be calculated for physical map contigs with multiple SNP markers mapped onto the linkage map. With the sex-averaged linkage map, the genetic size of 3,505.4 cM and the physical size of 965,279 kb based on the physical map, we estimated the average genetic size as 3.6 cM per Mb. The ratios observed from the 250 physical map contigs that contained multiple SNPs mapped onto the linkage map ranged from 0 to 2.26 cM per Mb. The markers with higher ratios might indicate the potential loci of recombination hot spots.4. DiscussionIn this work, we constructed a high-density genetic map for channel catfish. This map possesses the highest marker density among all the genetic linkage maps constructed for any aquaculture species. Taking advantage of the catfish 250K SNP array, we were able to efficiently and cost-effectively genotype 250,000 SNPs in the 576 fish from three mapping families (192 fish per family). Such a high-density linkage map should be a valuable resource for analysis and fine-scale QTL mapping in catfish.Although the efficient SNP genotyping technology allowed the construction of high-density linkage map, the high-resolution was yet to be achieved. A large number of markers fell into ‘zero recombination clusters’ where no recombination events occur during meiosis between the markers among the fish used for mapping analysis. These represent closely arrayed adjacent SNP positions, and their ordering is likely best achieved by assessing their order within the aligned physical map contigs. Conversely, it was also observed that genetic recombination rates could be artificially inflated when genotyping errors occur or when markers with large amounts of missing data are included in the analysis.42,43 Similar situations were observed previously in zebrafish during the construction of high-density genetic map. In zebrafish, the genetic sizes of initial map were over 1,000 cM per chromosome. After removal of genotyping errors, the genetic sizes were reduced to around 100 cM.44 To reduce the effect of clustered markers on the map construction and reduce the computing load, we picked one representative anchor marker that had the most informative meiosis from each of these clusters in the linkage map construction. Afterwards, we rejoined the markers within the ‘zero recombination clusters’ that were excluded during the initial mapping steps. This procedure relocated the informative markers onto the linkage maps based on the positions of their representative anchor marker. Such clustered markers are still valuable for the chromosome-scale scaffolding.With the availability of such high-density mapped SNPs, the patterns of marker distribution across chromosomes can be examined. It appears that clustered markers were commonly found in regions around centromeres while less frequently found around the telomeres. This was consistent with observations in various genetic maps previously developed in fish species, such as tilapia,45 medaka,46 rainbow trout,47 Atlantic salmon,12 and catfish.9,16 One potential explanation is that the centromeres contain abundant tandemly repeated, heterochromatic DNA sequences.48 As shown in Fig. 4, the distribution of mapped SNP markers across chromosomes in channel catfish is consistent with the observation of telomere and centromere effects,49 which would result in a higher recombination rate near the telomeres while a lower recombination rate near the centre of the chromosomes. The recombination rates might be positively correlated with GC content, as in human,50 pig,51 chicken,52 rodent,53 and yeast,54 or correlated with some other genomic features such as gene density and the presence of genes determining recombination hotspots. The PRDM9 gene was recently found to determine the recombination hotspots in the mammalian genomes.55–57 Future investigations on recombination landscape warrant the characterization of genomic features, affecting the meiotic recombination in catfish upon the availability of fully assembled genome sequences.The suppression of recombination in males relative to the females observed in channel catfish (averaged female-to-male ratio is 1.7 : 1) was consistent with our previous observation2 as well as many other studies. Recombination rates differ between the two sexes in many organisms where recombination occurs more frequently in the homogametic sex than in the heterogametic sex.50,58 The similar phenomenon was reported in many other fish species such as Atlantic salmon (1.38 : 1), rainbow trout (1.68 : 1), European sea bass (1.60 : 1), Arctic char (1.69 : 1), and silver carp (1.52 : 1).12,14,58–61 Striking recombination differences between the sexes were observed in zebrafish (2.74 : 1)58 and grass carp (2.0 : 1).62 These observations indicated that even closely related fish species differ in genetic sizes and the extent of sexual dimorphism for recombination fraction,50 similarly as in mammals. Although the genetic basis for recombination bias between sexes remains unknown, several theories were proposed to explain this observation. One explanation from selection perspective suggests that selection pressure is stronger in male gametes than in female gametes during the haploid life stage. This difference could lead to male-specific selection to maintain beneficial haplotype to decrease the male recombination rate.58,63 An alternative explanation is that the female recombination rate is higher to compensate for the apparently less stringent checkpoint for achiasmatic chromosomes compared with males.50 In human, cytological studies suggested that sex-specific differences in recombination may derive from chromatin differences established prior to the onset of the recombination pathway.64The high-density and the relatively high-resolution genetic map provides valuable resource for integrating the physical map and whole-genome assemblies. In this study, we anchored the catfish physical map to genetic linkage map through BES and PMCSS that contain SNP markers. With this linkage map of channel catfish, we were able to anchor 87% of the catfish BAC physical map contigs, covering ~92% of the catfish genome. This is a great improvement on map integration compared with our previous efforts that only anchored 44.8% of the catfish BAC physical map contigs accounting for 52.8% of the catfish genome. To our knowledge, this is also the highest percentage of physical maps integration with genetic maps that were obtained in any aquaculture species. The well-integrated map is useful for comprehensive comparative genomic analyses, fine-scale mapping of QTL, and positional cloning for candidate genes.10 Moreover, the integrated map can be used as an important resource for the validation of the catfish whole-genome assembly.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis project was supported by Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant (No. 2012-67015-19410) from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and partially supported by USDA Aquaculture Research Program Competitive Grant (No. 2014-70007-22395) from USDA NIFA.

IntroductionTrees have unique features that distinguish them from most herbaceous species, including large sizes, long lifespans and woody, perennial growth. Many tree species occur in widely distributed populations that harbour a wealth of diversity.1 Large, diverse tree populations can be exploited for breeding to improve economically important properties. In addition, deciphering the mechanisms by which forest trees have adapted to their changing environments is an intriguing research problem. Tree growth and wood formation are complex dynamic processes that require coordinate regulation of diverse metabolic pathways in the whole plant.2,3 Improving economically important traits in trees by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) will require improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation, particularly for traits with complex genetic architecture, such as wood properties or growth. Research has been hindered by trees' large size, long generation times, and the lack of mutants for reverse genetic approaches.1,4As an alternative approach, recent work has examined complex traits in trees by forward genetic methods, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) and association mapping of genes or alleles underlying quantitative traits.5 Single-marker association studies have identified candidate functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that explain a small proportion of the additive variation (=5% on average) in growth or wood properties, and many of these genes have not been cloned in full length yet.6–10 It is well known that genes do not work in isolation; instead, complex cellular pathways and molecular networks are often involved in phenotypic variation.11 Variation in quantitative traits includes additive, dominant, and epistatic effects that are conferred by multiple variants within interactive genes in different biological pathways.11,12 The complete effects of genetic variation for multiple full-length genes [including promoter, introns, untranslated regions (UTRs), and exons] in related biological pathways remain to be addressed in forest trees. Multi-gene association models take advantage of large numbers of SNPs in population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) with QTL regions harbouring functional loci affecting complex traits.13 Studies using multi-gene association may identify genetic variants that jointly have significant effects but individually make only a small contribution.13,14Our previous studies using single-marker association (i.e. mixed linear models15) have identified sites of SNPs in several candidate genes that located in close proximity to the causal polymorphisms or even the functional variant itself for growth and wood-property traits.16–19 To extend these observations, this study investigates the nature of genetic variance (additive, dominant, and epistatic effects) for 11 full-length candidate genes related to cellulose biosynthesis in 10 quantitative traits, using multi-gene association, as well as haplotype-based association approaches, in a population of 460 unrelated individuals of Populus tomentosa. To verify the most significant associations, we conducted single-marker analysis in a family-based linkage population consisting of 1,200 individuals. Moreover, tissue-specific transcript abundances of these genes provide a better understanding of the multi-gene network, affecting tree growth and lignocellulose biosynthesis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Population materials and phenotypic dataThe discovery population (association population) consisted of 460 24-yr-old unrelated individuals, representing almost the entire natural distribution range of P. tomentosa, i.e. Southern region, Northwestern region, and Northeastern region (30–40°N, 105–125°E). Plants were randomly sampled in 2009 from a collection of 1,047 natural P. tomentosa in Guan Xian County, Shandong Province, China (36°23'N, 115°47'E) and used for the initial multi-gene association (Supplementary Table S1, Du et al.12). In addition, 40 unrelated individuals were randomly selected from this association population and used to identify SNPs.To confirm the association results identified in the discovery population, a validation population (linkage population) consisting of 1,200 hybrid individuals were randomly selected from 5,000 F1 progeny established by controlled crossing between clone ‘YX01’ (Populus alba× Populus glandulosa) as the female and clone ‘LM 50’ (P. tomentosa) as the male. The progeny were planted in 2008 in the Xiao Tangshan horticultural fields, Beijing, China (40°2'N, 115°50'E) using a randomized complete block design with three replications per genotype.Ten growth and wood-property traits were scored for all individuals in the two populations, using at least three replications per genotype. The growth traits were tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and stem volume. The wood-property traits were holocellulose, a-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content (chemical composition), and fibre length, fibre width, and microfibre angle (physical properties) (Supplementary data S1–S2). The detailed sampling and measurement methods, and phenotypic variance for these 10 traits in the two populations were conducted as previously described.17,20 Pearson's correlations for these 10 phenotypic traits were shown in Supplementary data S3.2.2. RNA extraction and cDNAs identificationThirty ramets of 1-yr-old P. tomentosa clone ‘LM50’ were selected and planted at Xiao Tangshan horticultural fields, Beijing, China (40°2'N, 115°50'E). A piece of bark was peeled off from the main stem at ~1.0 m height of 1-yr-old P. tomentosa clone ‘LM50’ using a chisel. The newly formed xylem (~3 mm thick) was first removed from the exposed surface, and then mature xylem was collected by further scraping into the stem at ~2 mm thick; finally, the collected samples were placed into 50-ml Falcon tubes filled with liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at -80°C until RNA extraction.21 Using the Plant Qiagen RNeasy kit, total RNA from the stem xylem tissues was extracted and then reverse transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The stem xylem cDNA library was constructed using the Superscript <U+03BB> System (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA). The detailed procedures for constructing the cDNA library were previously described by Li et al.21 In our study, the cDNA library consisted of 5.0 × 106 pfu with an insert size range of 1.0–4.0 kb. By random end-sequencing of 30,000 cDNA clones and comparison with all sequences in NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), we chose 11 cDNAs with high similarities to Arabidopsis or Populus trichocarpa sequences to examine the relationship with lignocellulosic biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S2). All cDNA sequences chosen were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers shown in Supplementary Table S2).2.3. DNA extraction and full-length genomic DNA identificationUsing the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen China, Shanghai), total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh young leaves. For sequencing the full-length genomic DNA sequences, specific primers were designed based on each cDNA sequence. PCR amplification was performed according to Zhang et al.22 All the genomic DNA of candidate genes were obtained by direct sequencing of both strands, using conserved T7 and SP6 primers in the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (version 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and a 4300 DNA Analyzer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Full-length genomic DNA sequences of all 11 candidate genes were isolated by PCR amplification from the P. tomentosa LM50 clone (Supplementary Table S2). Of these, five of these genes were previously reported in single-marker association studies (Supplementary Table S2). Also, these 11 full-length gene sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers shown in Supplementary Table S2).2.4. Tissue-specific expression analysisFresh tissues (root, stem phloem, stem cambium, developing xylem, mature xylem, expanding leaf, expanded leaf, and apex) were sampled from 1-yr-old plants of P. tomentosa (clone LM50). Developing xylem tissues were collected by scraping the thin (~1.0 mm) and partially ligni<U+FB01>ed layer on the exposed xylem surface of main stems at the 1.0 m height of plant, and the liquid stem cambium was collected from the exposed xylem surface as described previously.21 The main root (5 cm in length), expanding leaf (the 2–3rd leaf from the stem top), expanded leaf (the 5–6th leaf), and the final shoot apex (2–3 mm in length) were immediately collected from 1-yr-old P. tomentosa clone ‘LM50’. The extraction of RNA from various fresh tissues and the reverse transcription into cDNA was used for testing of tissues-specific transcript abundance for all 11 candidate genes. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) was performed on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI) using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche). The qPCR program and the real-time amplification reaction were performed as described by Du et al.16 All reactions were performed in triplicate technical and triplicate biological repetitions, respectively. The melting curve was used to check the specificity of the amplified fragments, and all data were analysed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis software 3.1 tool (Bio-Rad, USA), following the manual protocol. The results obtained for the different tissues were standardized to the levels of Actin gene (the internal control). The specific primer pairs were individually designed to target the 3' UTR of each gene, using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) (Supplementary Table S3). Mean value and standard deviation (s.d.) for expression data of all repetitions in each set was determined using SPSS Statistics Version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (Details not shown).To better understand the co-expression interactions among these candidate genes, Pearson's correlations between each pair of genes were determined for all 11 genes, according to their tissue-specific transcript abundances in SPSS Statistics, version 19.0. A structural network representing significant gene–gene correlations was visualized using the NodeXL Excel Template, version 1.0.1.238 (http://nodexl.codeplex.com/).2.5. SNP discovery and genotypingTo identify SNPs, full-length genomic DNA of all 11 candidate genes were sequenced and aligned among 40 unrelated individuals from the association population of P. tomentosa, without considering insertions/deletions (INDELs). All 440 sequences were deposited in GenBank (Supplementary Table S4). Sequence alignments and manual editing were performed as described by Du et al.17 Next, all common SNPs (minor allele frequency =0.05) identified were genotyped using the Beckman Coulter (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) sequencing system.2.6. Nucleotide diversity and LDDiploid sequences were phased into haplotypes with the Phase v. 2.1, using 10,000 iterations of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Model.23 We then used alignments of these 40 phased haplotypes for each gene to estimate the number of segregating sites, nucleotide diversity, neutrality tests, and the pattern of codon usage with DnaSP version 5.10.24 Nucleotide diversity was estimated using the average number of pairwise differences per site (p)25,26 and the number of segregating sites (<U+03B8>w).27 Neutrality test statistics, Tajima's D,28 and Fu and Li's D,29 were calculated using data for the whole population with 10,000 coalescent simulations. The pattern of codon usage was measured using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU).30The squared correlation of allele frequencies (r2)31 between each pair of common SNPs (frequency = 0.05) within candidate genes was calculated with 105 permutations, using TASSEL Ver. 2.0.1 (http://www.maizegenetics.net/). To assess the extent of LD within the sequenced gene regions, the decay of LD with physical distance (base pairs) within each candidate locus and over all candidate genes was estimated in 10,000 permutations of the data by non-linear regression.32 Singletons were excluded in the LD analyses. This analysis was done both within the three climatic regions and for the complete data set.2.7. Association analysisfGWAS, version 2.0 (http://statgen.psu.edu/software/fgwas-soft.html, Li et al.33), in R (http://cran.r-project.org/) was used to conduct multi-SNP association analyses. For each trait, the genotyping data for all common SNPs and their genomic positional information were identified and standardized using PLINK version 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/res.shtml). This software is a Bayesian hierarchical model and use a MCMC algorithm to simultaneously <U+FB01>t and estimate the possible additive and dominant effects associated with all SNPs. The proportion of the phenotypic variance (R2) explained by each particular SNP was estimated in the models. Positive dominance represents that the phenotypic mean value observed within the heterozygous class is higher than the average phenotypic mean across both homozygous classes based on Least Squares Means, whereas negative dominance was opposite (not a recessive lethal). To address the total phenotypic variance accounted for by all trait-associated SNPs on a trait-by-trait basis, we calculated a ‘cumulative R2’ metric. These values were obtained by the difference in R2 between full and reduced models.34 The details were referenced according to McKown et al.35A multifactorial dimensionality reduction (MDR) method36 that was designed specifically for detecting and characterizing non-additive interactions (i.e. epistasis). The ReliefF algorithm was applied to filter all unlinked SNPs (r2 < 0.1 or different genes) to the best five loci for each trait that provide the greatest signal with 100 nearest neighbours. MDR was applied to assess all two-way to five-way models for the five significant filtered SNPs. Finally, an independent assessment of epistasis was performed using entropy-based measures of information gain.37 Specifically, a new measure model of three-way epistasis that adjusts for lower order effects was used to examine high-order non-additive interactions.38All high-LD haplotypes (r2= 0.70, P= 0.001) were estimated for each gene, and their frequencies were determined using HaploView version 4.2 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview.html). Singleton alleles and haplotypes with a frequency <5% were discarded when constructing the haplotypes. Haplotype-based association tests with phenotypic traits were performed using the Haplo.stats package in R,39 and significances of the haplotype associations were identified based on 104 permutation tests. The input consisted of genotype matrices, phenotype matrices, and structure analysis matrices (Q) to correct for population structure.40 In this analysis, the Q matrix was identified according to the optimal subpopulation structure in our association population.41 Corrections for multiple testing of smoothed P-values for all associations were performed using the false discovery rate (FDR) through QVALUE.42 A q-value of 0.10 was considered as the significance threshold.On the basis of significant SNPs identified above, gene sequences were compared between hybrid parents, and SNP markers that segregated in the 1,200 F1 progeny were selected. Inheritance tests of these SNPs were examined in the linkage population by performing a <U+03C7>2 test at 0.01 probability, and SNPs following Mendelian expectations were used in single-marker analysis using PLINK version 1.07. The same FDR method was used to correct for multiple tests.423. Results3.1. Tissue-specific transcript profilingTo provide insights into gene interactions and functions in the biological pathway, we examined transcript accumulation for 11 candidate genes in various tissues and organs of P. tomentosa, including root, stem, and leaf (Fig. 1A). We found that the 11 genes exhibited distinct, but partially overlapping patterns of expression. Most genes were preferentially expressed in the developing xylem and mature xylem, with moderate expression in the cambium region and expanded leaves (Fig. 1A). For example, in the stem of P. tomentosa, Cellulose synthase 7 (PtoCesA7), UDP-glucose dehydrogenase 1 (PtoUGDH1), and S-adenosine-l-homocysteine-hydrolase 1 (PtoSAHH1) transcripts were most abundant in the developing and mature xylems, with moderate abundance in the cambium. PtoCesA7 and PtoUGDH1 were also preferentially expressed in roots (Fig. 1A), whereas PtoCesA3 and UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase 1 (PtoUXS1) were highly expressed in the apex (Fig. 1A). PtoUXS1 were most abundant in expanded leaves. Tissue-specific transcript profiling and a correlation network of 11 candidate genes in Populus tomentosa.

Data were log-transformed before Pearson's correlation.Next, we constructed gene–gene correlation networks using the patterns of tissue-specific expression of these 11 candidate genes and identified 20 positive or negative gene–gene correlations (P = 0.05, Supplementary Table S5) that make up a highly interrelated network (Fig. 1B). Of these gene pairs, PtoCesA3 and Sucrose synthase 1 (PtoSUS1) (P = 0.01, R = -0.938), PtoSAHH1 and PtoSAHH2 (P = 0.01, R = 0.959), and PtoCesA4 and Endo-1,4-ß-glucanase 1 (PtoGH9A1) (P = 0.01, R = 0.952) showed highly significant correlations (Supplementary Table S5).3.2. SNP discovery and nucleotide diversityWe first used a re-sequencing approach to identify SNPs in all 11 candidate genes. By sequencing the 11 full-length genes from 40 unrelated individuals encompassing nearly the entire natural range of P. tomentosa, we identified 2,114 SNPs in the c. 47,300 bp sequenced, with an average density of one SNP per 25 bp. Of these SNPs, c. 44.0% (930) were common sites (frequency = 0.05) (Supplementary Table S4). The SNPs were not evenly distributed, with the number of SNPs per gene ranging from 59 to 388 (average, 192), consistent with varying levels of nucleotide diversity among genes (Supplementary Table S4). Using sequences from the P. trichocarpa reference as an out-group, a survey of the single-base mutation types indicated that C : T changes were the most abundant (38.6%), followed by A : G changes (30.4%), and overall SNPs the ratio of transitions to transversions was 2.23.Within the coding regions of all 11 genes (22,098 bp total sequence), the average non-synonymous nucleotide diversity (dN) was ~5-fold lower than the synonymous nucleotide diversity (dS), and the dN/dS ratio was <1 for all exons, indicating strong purifying selection at non-synonymous sites at these Populus genes.22 To investigate the extent of codon bias in P. tomentosa, we calculated RSCU values for all types of codons and found that the 11 candidate genes show similar patterns of RSCU (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most of the preferred codons end with U, but A and G were also less commonly found in the third position in these genes. Previous studies indicated that codon bias (with C or G ending codons) is expected to be strongest for highly expressed genes.34 Thus, our observation may be consistent with low expressed values for all these genes (Fig. 1A). More work is needed to sort these issues out in P. tomentosa. The values of Fu and Li's D statistical tests were negative for all genes, with four significant departures observed in the whole population (P= 0.05, Supplementary Table S4), revealing an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms in the species-wide samples.3.3. SNP genotyping and LDWe selected a set of 651 common SNPs that met the quality control thresholds and that had genotype frequencies consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (Supplementary data S4). The percentage of successfully genotyped SNPs that were found in non-coding regions of the genes was 75.4%, distributed within introns (45.4%), 5' UTRs (16.9%), and 3' UTRs (13.1%). Remaining SNPs were located in the coding regions, either at synonymous sites (18.5%) or at non-synonymous sites (6.1%).Estimates of r2 values for all pairwise combinations of SNPs were pooled to assess the overall pattern of LD with physical distance (Fig. 2). The non-linear regression shows a clear and rapid decline of LD from 0.60 to 0.10 at a distance of ~1,100 bp in the whole population (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, LD analyses within each geographical climatic region showed a much higher level of LD with the r2 values declining to 0.1 within c. 2,300 bp (Southern and Northeastern regions) and c. 3,400 bp (Northwestern region) (Fig. 2). We found a clear and rapid decline of LD with distance within each gene in the whole population, respectively (r2 = 0.1, within c. 500–1,800 bp, Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating that LD does not extend over entire gene in the species. Decay pattern of LD in all Populus tomentosa samples and each climatic region. Decay of LD for all common SNP (minor allele frequency = 5%) sites pooled across all analysed genes. Pairwise correlations between SNPs are plotted against the physical distance between the SNPs in base pairs. The curves describe the non-linear regressions of r2 (Er2) onto the physical distance in base pairs. The details of three climatic regions are shown in Supplementary Table S1.Decay pattern of LD in all Populus tomentosa samples and each climatic region.

The curves describe the non-linear regressions of r2 (Er2) onto the physical distance in base pairs. The details of three climatic regions are shown in Supplementary Table S1.3.4. Multi-SNP association under additive, dominance, and epistasis modelsWe first employed Bayesian hierarchical models, emphasizing multi-SNP additive and dominant effects for each quantitative trait, and uncovered a multitude of genetic associations, including some not previously found by single-marker methods (Supplementary Table S6). Some particular SNP-trait associations detected previously were examined in this case; for example, a non-synonymous substitution in exon3 of PtoCesA4 (PtoCesA4_1914) was shown to be in strong association with a-cellulose.17 We then constructed a structural network to visually represent all 123 associations (P < 0.01) between all 10 growth and wood-property traits and 93 unique SNPs (Fig. 3). The 93 loci were not evenly distributed among all 11 genes, with a range from 1 (PtoBGlu1, ß-1,4-glucosidase) to 19 (PtoUXS1). 37.6% of the 93 loci were distributed in coding regions, and among these, 94.3% of the associations contained a combination of additive and dominant effects (Supplementary Table S6). A structural network that represents all significant associations (P < 0.01) in the association population of Populus tomentosa.

All associations were identified between 10 growth and wood-property traits and 93 unique SNPs from 11 candidate genes using Bayesian hierarchical models. Different colours represent different genes with corresponding SNPs. The number of SNPs identified in each gene is shown in parentheses.We detected 118 significant associations for a total of 92 unique SNPs within 11 genes associated with all 10 traits (Table 1 and Supplementary data S6). Total numbers of identified SNP-trait associations varied across trait categories, and the association numbers of associations for wood chemical compositions, wood physical properties, and growth traits were 40, 38, and 40, respectively. SNP markers explained between 0.5 and 6.6% of the phenotypic variation (average R2 = 2.3%; Supplementary Table S6). Twenty-four of the 92 SNP markers exhibited significant associations with at least two traits (Supplementary Table S6). Although the association result does not indicate which SNPs may be causal, 11 of these 92 unique SNPs represent amino acid replacement (non-synonymous) polymorphisms (Supplementary Table S6). For each trait, the number of significant SNPs ranged from 8 to 16, which captured a small to moderate fraction (17.0–36.0%) of the additive variation when considered jointly (Table 1, Fig. 4). Summary of the additive effect and phenotypic contribution rate (R2) of all significant SNPs for each trait in the Populus tomentosa association populationSee Supplementary Table S6 for further details of these association results under additive models; significance level for association (significance is P = 0.01).Total R2 was calculated according to McKown et al.35Summary of the additive effect and phenotypic contribution rate (R2) of all significant SNPs for each trait in the Populus tomentosa association populationSee Supplementary Table S6 for further details of these association results under additive models; significance level for association (significance is P = 0.01).Total R2 was calculated according to McKown et al.35Low-to-moderate phenotypic contribution rate (R2) explained for growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa.

All SNPs were identified using the Bayesian hierarchical models in fGWAS, version 1.0 (http://statgen.psu.edu/software/fgwas-soft.html) in R (http://cran.r-project.org/).Correspondingly, each trait was associated with variation in at least five candidate genes (Table 1). Furthermore, we identified three genes (PtoCesA4, PtoCesA7, and PtoSAHH2) that were associated to all four wood chemical compositions. (Supplementary Table S6). For wood physical properties, SNP-trait associations were identified for four genes (PtoCesA3, PtoCesA4, PtoSUS1, and PtoUXS1) that were associated with all three traits. In addition, PtoCesA7 and PtoSAHH2 were associated with fibre length and microfibre angle (Supplementary Table S6). Additive models found nine genes with SNPs associated with variation in growth traits; of these, two genes (PtoCesA3 and PtoUXS1) with SNPs associated across all three growth traits, as well as identified with all three wood physical properties (Supplementary Tables S6). At least five SNPs within PtoUXS1 had associations to each growth trait. No significant SNP from PtoUGDH and PtoBGlu1 was associated with growth traits.On the basis of these additive SNPs simultaneously associated to each trait (Supplementary Table S6), we identified phenotypic variation among possible genotype combinations for the same trait and some genotype combinations that may be useful for selection breeding. An example of multi-genotype combinations for lignin is shown in Fig. 5. Eight SNPs from six different genes were significantly associated with lignin content, with two associated SNPs from PtoGH9A1 showing low LD and hence representing independent associations.

(A) These eight allelic variants have significant additive effect with a small proportion of phenotypic variation (R2), ranging from 0.80 to 5.48%.

Of the 92 SNPs, ~95% of the significant SNPs had both additive and dominant effects on all traits within each category (Supplementary Table S6). Many genes were repeatedly associated with multiple traits within/across trait categories, and different SNPs with different effects from the same gene were identified. A number of SNP associations with positive versus negative effect across the three trait categories were 25/16 for wood chemical compositions, 25/12 for wood physical properties, and 22/21 for growth traits (Table 2). When we considered dominant variation per trait by combining the positive and negative types, the total number of significant SNPs varied from 8 to 18, with the total R2 explained ranging from 1.8 to 13.0% (Fig. 4).

Of these, 22 SNPs were located in the coding regions, including 7 non-synonymous and 15 synonymous changes. A number of significant SNPs per gene varied from 1 to 11. For each trait, the number of SNPs ranged from 3 to 10, with total R2 explained ranging from 9.0 to 30.0% (Table 2). For the 49 associations showing negative dominant effects, we identified 44 loci from 10 genes that were significantly associated with 10 traits, with a small R2 explained per locus ranging from 0.6 to 5.4%, respectively. The number of significant SNP within each gene varied from 1 (PtoBGlu1) to 11 (PtoUXS1). A range of 2–8 SNPs with the negative dominant effects was found for each trait, with total variation explained ranging from 4.4% (a-cellulose) to 17.3% (microfibre angle) (Table 2). Ten SNPs from six genes that simultaneously have positive and negative dominant effects for different traits (Supplementary Table S6). For example, the synonymous SNP PtoSAHH2_285 had a negative dominant effect for lignin, while having a positive effect for holocellulose. Table 2 shows detailed descriptions of the genetic parameters for all traits under positive and negative dominant effects.We used the MDR method (http://phg.mc.vanderbilt.edu/Software/MDR) to detect and characterize SNP–SNP epistasis associated with these traits (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). We first applied the ReliefF algorithm to filter all unlinked SNPs (r2 < 0.1 or located in different genes) to identify significant 5 loci per trait. After correcting for multiple testing, we found 42 associations (Q = 0.10) across nine traits. These associations represent 34 unique SNPs from seven genes with main effects varying from 0.1 to 7.5% (Supplementary Table S7). We found that 9 of the 34 unique SNPs observed in the epistasis models also showed significant additive and dominant effects. Using multi-way SNP–SNP interaction models for these filtered SNPs, we identified 58 significant SNP–SNP pairs where the epistatic interactions ranged from -7.0 to 0.9% (Supplementary Table S8). The majority of epistatic effects were found between unlinked loci located in different genes. We also detected epistatic effects among different SNPs within the same gene. For instance, two epistasis pairs consisting of three SNPs within PtoCesA4 were identified for fibre length, all with negative interaction values (Supplementary Table S8).Three-way interaction model provided a combination of three non-synonymous loci (PtoCesA4_1914, PtoGH9A1_1936, and PtoGA20ox_632) from three unique genes, representing a significant epistatic interaction for DBH and stem volume, with three-way epistatic effects of -11.7 and -12.1% (Fig. 6A). Negative epistatic effects suggest redundancy between loci, meaning that these loci provide, in part, the same information for the traits.36 Figure 6B shows the mean values of phenotypic variances among all three genotype combinations. We investigated the nature of epistatic interactions among non-synonymous mutations, contributing to the phenotypic variation, in the three genes, and discovered that most of the variation is captured by combinatorial permutations of allelic variants at three loci (Fig. 6C). We identified the specific combinatorial patterns of amino acid replacements at these three loci, by comparing the expected values of eight combinations with high (H) or low (L) phenotypic values with the observed values of the specific combinatorial patterns (Fig. 6).

In total, we identified 118, 121, and 43 associations consistent with additive, dominant, and epistatic effects, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6–S8). Also, we observed no differences in the magnitudes of additive and dominant effects between three trait categories (Tables 1 and 2). Some genes have extensive complexity in both genetic variation and the resulting phenotype, and numerous SNPs from different genes were associated across these three trait categories, suggesting that tree growth and wood biosynthesis are complex, dynamic processes that require the coordinate regulation of diverse sets of genes.2,3 Notably, our present investigation suggests that CesA members may have additional functional roles in tree growth and development, beyond the direct effects of the cellulose synthase subunits in biosynthesis of the cell wall. CesA members represent an interesting set of candidates for further study in trees.3.5. Validation of association in the linkage populationTo validate the associations identified above, we examined associations in a linkage population. From the 118 unique significant SNPs obtained by multi-SNP and MDR models (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7), we identified 109 common SNP markers that segregated in the 1,200 F1 progeny following Mendelian expectations (P = 0.01, Supplementary data S5). We conducted 1,090 tests for association of these SNP with growth and wood-quality traits (109 SNPs × 10 traits) in the linkage population. After correction for multiple testing errors, we found 61 associations at the threshold of Q = 0.10, representing 38 SNPs from nine genes that show associations with all 10 traits (Supplementary Table S9). These 38 unique SNPs included 5 non-synonymous, 15 synonymous, and 18 non-coding SNPs (Supplementary Table S9). Thirty SNPs were similarly detected by multi-SNP additive and dominance models in the discovery population, and nine loci were shared between the epistasis models and the single-marker analysis (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Most of the significant markers were identified for multiple traits with different genotypic effects; for example, PtoCesA4_1914 is associated with seven traits, and PtoGA20ox_632 with six (Supplementary Table S9). In addition, 28 (46.0%) associations identified in the validation population were similarly detected in the multi-SNP models (Supplementary Tables S6 and S9). For each trait, the number of SNPs ranged from 3 to 9, with marker effects that varied from 2.2 to 13.5% (Supplementary Table S9). Effect sizes for the SNPs analysed using single-marker linkage test were nearly 2-fold higher than effects identified using multi-SNP models (average R2 = 3.8%).Correspondingly, each trait is associated with at least three candidate genes (Supplementary Table S9) using single-marker linkage analysis. With wood chemical composition, we identified two genes (PtoCesA4 and PtoCesA7) that were simultaneously associated with the content of all four polysaccharide traits. In addition, we identified that PtoGH9A1 was significantly associated with hemicellulose and lignin contents, whereas PtoCesA3 was associated with hemicellulose and a-cellulose content (Supplementary Table S9). Among wood physical properties and growth traits, SNP-trait associations identified two genes (PtoCesA4 and PtoGA20Ox) that were associated with all six traits. Furthermore, PtoUXS1 has SNPs associated with both DBH and stem volume traits, as well as two wood physical properties (fibre width and microfibre angle), consistent with the associations under multi-SNP models in our discovery population (Supplementary Tables S6 and S9). No SNPs from PtoUGDH1 and PtoBGlu1 were associated with any of the 10 phenotypic traits.3.6 Haplotype-based association analysisWe identified 138 high-LD blocks (r2 = 0.70, P = 0.001), including 429 common haplotypes (frequency = 5%) from the 11 candidate genes, with block sizes from 2 to 564 bp. The number of common haplotypes per block varied from 2 to 7, with an average of 3.0 (Table 3). The number of LD blocks and common haplotypes per gene varied from 4 to 20 and 15 to 60, respectively (Table 3). Haplotype-based association tests identified a total of 162 common haplotypes from 66 blocks at P = 0.05 (Table 3 and Supplementary data S10). Using multiple test corrections, we found 39 significant blocks from 10 candidate genes, including 90 haplotypes, that associated with nine traits excluding stem volume (139 associations, Q = 0.10); no significant haplotypes were found for PtoSAHH2. The number of blocks and haplotypes for each trait ranged from 2 to 12 and 5 to 33, respectively (Supplementary Table S11).

For example, haplotypes belonging to PtoUXS1 were associated with seven traits. PtoCesA7 had haplotypes that were simultaneously associated with all four chemical composition traits. In addition, PtoUGDH1 with haplotypes were significantly associated with three chemical compositions, excluding a-cellulose content (Supplementary Table S11). PtoUXS1 had haplotypes that were associated with all three wood physical properties. Within the growth trait category, several significant haplotypes were identified within PtoUXS1 and PtoSUS1 that were associated with tree height and DBH. Examination of haplotypes may provide support for the SNP-based association.On the basis of the significant blocks we identified within several genes for each trait (Supplementary Table S11), we identified four exclusive multi-haplotype combinations with numerous genetic variants for three traits—holocellulose, lignin, and tree height (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taking holocellulose content as example, we identified several combinations of multiple haplotypes from two significant blocks in PtoCesA4 and PtoGH9A1, with mean values from 66.725 to 75.321%, consistent with the two genes having significant correlation (P = 0.01, R = 0.952) (Fig. 1B). In addition, eight unique haplotypes from four genes, showing specific (presence/absence) for different climatic regions of the natural population of P. tomentosa, were associated with five traits, respectively (Table 4). For fibre width, two haplotypes (C-A-G and T-A-G) from PtoSUS1 and PtoBGlu1 were exclusively found in the Northwestern region, and were associated with higher fibre width (Supplementary Table S11).

Discussion4.1. Functional interpretations of genetic associationsHere we have used multi-gene association approaches, combining extensive full-length candidate genes from a shared biological pathway and with detailed, replicated phenotypic information from natural populations of P. tomemtosa to uncover numerous loci underlying variation in wood chemical composition, physical properties, and growth traits. We further validated mostly these associations in an independent linkage population. Significant additive, dominant, and epistatic effects were observed for tree growth and lignocellulosic composition. The number of associations we detected is larger, while the average R2 explained individually is lower, than in previous single-marker association for similar traits in the association population.16–19 Supportively, effect sizes for the SNPs analysed in a large size of linkage population (average R2 = 3.8%) were nearly 2-fold higher than effects identified using multi-gene association models, suggesting that pathway-based association analyses across multiple genes may provide higher power to uncover the relatively small individual effects.14,43 Also, it is possible that linkage drag in regions around the candidate genes causes larger R2 values of allelic variants in the linkage population than in the association population. More statistics models for estimating the genetic effect in multiple population backgrounds are needed. Markers found to be associated with traits span both coding and non-coding portions of genes, with a predominance for additive effects and small effect sizes (Tables 1 and 2), suggesting that this best describe the genetic architecture of complex traits in trees.5,44 Low to moderate R2 were captured by fitting all SNPs simultaneously from all 11 candidate genes (Fig. 4), suggesting that we thus far lack sufficient genomic coverage to capture the majority genetic variation. Many genes with significant SNPs for three trait categories were detected, consistent with our expectations of modelling all combined markers from a set of interrelated genes concurrently, instead of using candidate gene-based ‘one-marker-at-a-time’ approach in tree species.45All candidate genes were originally isolated from a xylem cDNA library of P. tomentosa, and a part of the genes was highly up-regulated in xylem tissue (Fig. 1A), indicating that these genes are likely main candidates for participating in secondary cell wall formation. Previous studies have indicated that wood biosynthesis and tree growth require the coordinate regulation of diverse metabolic pathways, and that the genes in these shared pathways are often functional homologs.3,8 This viewpoint agrees with our observation that the number of common genes (i.e. genes that were identified as being significantly associated with a trait at least twice using different association models, including additive effect, dominance, epistasis, and haplotype) affecting each trait varied from 2 to 6 (Table 5). We identified PtoCesA4 and PtoCesA7 as being associated to four wood chemical compositions (Table 5 and Supplementary data S6), consistent with the central role played by CesA7 and CesA4, as subunits of the CesA complex required for proper secondary wall cellulose synthesis as well as other possible functions related to wall function.46,47 The result supports previous association studies by Wegrzyn et al.7 and Du et al.16,17 In addition, we identified two common genes directly related to polysaccharides (PtoCesA4 and PtoUXS1) that were associated simultaneously with all three wood ultrastructure traits (Table 5). UXS is likely ubiquitous among plants and is a target for regulatory control during cell wall biosynthesis,17 which further supports our findings that PtoUXS1 explains a significant amount of R2 of all growth traits (Table 5). However, the mechanism by which specific allelic variation in PtoUXS1 could affect tree cell elongation is not yet apparent. Identification of the common genes significantly related to growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa+: genes that were identified as being significantly associated with a trait at least two times using different models, including additive effect, dominance, epistasis, and haplotype.Identification of the common genes significantly related to growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa+: genes that were identified as being significantly associated with a trait at least two times using different models, including additive effect, dominance, epistasis, and haplotype.Taking a-cellulose content as an example, we identified six common genes significantly related to this trait, specifically PtoBGlu1, PtoCesA3, PtoCesA4, PtoCesA7, PtoGH9A1, and PtoSUS1 (Table 5). When taken together, multi-SNP models explained a small to moderate portions of the variation from both additive and dominant effects (31.7 and 12.2%, respectively). Previous evidence suggest that these six genes may play key roles in cellulose biosynthesis,47–49 supporting these observations. SNPs in PtoSUS1 showed high additive and dominant effects (Supplementary Table S6), and two LD blocks, including five significant haplotypes (Supplementary Table S11), were associated with a-cellulose. In plants, SUS catalyzes a reversible reaction that preferentially converts sucrose into fructose and UDP-glucose. UDP-glucose is the immediate precursor for the synthesis of cellulose.50 Another enzyme involved in cellulose formation during xylem development is ß-glucosidase (BGlu), which hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose, and is a rate-limiting factor during enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.51 Here, we identified two haplotypes and a non-coding SNP in PtoBGlu1 (Supplementary Tables S6 and S11). Furthermore, korrigan cellulase (KOR), an endo-ß-1,4-glucanase, belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9), can hydrolyze the ß-1,4 linkage of the cellulose chain.52PtoGH9A1, an orthologue of KORRIGAN1, contains three haplotypes associated with a-cellulose (Supplementary Table S6), and we also found epistatic interactions for the trait between a non-synonymous SNP (PtoGH9A1_1936) and SNPs in PtoCesA3 and PtoCesA4. These findings were supported by significant correlations in gene expression among these six genes (Fig. 1B).A similar situation was also observed for hemicellulose, the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose, where we identified several haplotypes and eight SNPs from five of the candidate genes (Supplementary Tables S6 and S11). Of these, PtoUGDP1 and PtoUXS1 are key enzymes in hemicellulose biosynthesis.53,54 Five common candidate genes were shared between wood-property and growth traits (Table 5). PtoSAHH2 is associated with hemicellulose, tree height, and stem volume. The observation is consistent with SAHH being a cytokinin-binding protein participating in xylogenesis.46 Interestingly, associations with lignin were found within genes directly or indirectly related to cellulose or xylan biosynthesis, such as PtoUXS1, PtoCesA4, and PtoCesA7 (Table 5). This finding was supported by the strong genetic interrelations between the lignin biosynthetic pathway and polysaccharide biosynthesis.3,55 Applying biological pathway-based association11 to examine many more candidate genes involved in the diverse metabolic pathways of tree is needed in future investigation.The numerous genes that we detected have multiple significant associations across all three trait categories (Tables 1–3, and 5), and the finding was possible to be explained by two hypothesis. On one hand, significant genetic correlations were frequently estimated among multiple related trait fractions or percentages of the whole tree body, especially within each trait category in our present study (Supplementary data S3). On the other hand, this observation may be considered to be an indication of pleiotropy in the broad sense, and the potential pleiotropic loci identified in this study provide novel candidates for explaining phenotypic variation in Populus. Pleiotropic loci span multiple functions and may have effects by acting upstream in signalling pathways that affect many traits or by directly targeting multiple genes for regulation,35 which is consistent with our discoveries that PtoGA20Ox, PtoSAHH1, and PtoSAHH2 are all associated with multiple traits (Tables 1–5). More work should be focused on transcription factors/regulators in future.4.2. Epistasis for growth and wood-property traitsNon-additive interactions between separate mutations (epistasis) can significantly influence the rate and direction of evolutionary change.13 Also, epistasis is an important but often-ignored component of genetic variation in breeding for quantitative traits, due to limited statistical power to detect and estimate epistasis. In our study, we detected and characterized SNP–SNP epistasis associated with the phenotypic traits by using a MDR method (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). The detection of epistasis hence provides necessary information complementary to that gained through single-locus analysis. We observed that 11 of the 34 unique SNPs identified through the MDR analyses were located in coding regions, with the remaining 23 being located in non-coding regions (Supplementary Table S7), supporting the notion that most associations exhibited pervasive epistatic effects and that it involves both non-coding and coding polymorphisms.56We identified three non-synonymous loci from three unique genes with significant epistatic effects for DBH and stem volume (Fig. 6 A–D). The similar epistatic pattern for these two traits may be due to a significant positive phenotypic correlation (Supplementary data S3).20 Also, the observation may be supported by previous studies reporting that examinations of interactions between amino acid mutations in the same/shared proteins underlying variation in a measurable phenotype may best reveal the mechanisms of epistasis.57 Without the expectations of an additive null model, the phenotypic effects of allelic substitutions (L <U+2192> H and H <U+2192> L) at specific combinatorial patterns of amino acid replacements at these three non-synonymous mutations were highly dependent on genetic background.58 We observed two specific combinatorial patterns: first, in the presence of each amino acid type (H for Ser and L for Thr) in PtoGH9A1_1936, the Asn (L) in PtoGA20Ox_632 conferred an increased phenotype value on the Asn (L) background in PtoCesA4_1914, and a decrease on the His (H) background in PtoCesA4_1914 (Fig. 6B and C). Similarly, the L-type amino acid type in PtoCesA4_1914 conferred a decrease on the Ser (H) background in PtoGA20Ox_632 and an increase on the Asn (L) background in PtoGA20Ox_632 (Fig. 6B and C). Second, without consideration of amino acid types present in PtoCesA4_1914, the L-type in PtoGH9A1_1936 conferred an increased phenotype value in the L background in PtoGA20Ox_632 and a decrease on the H background in PtoGA20Ox_632 (Fig. 6B and C). Similarly, the L-type amino acid in PtoGA20Ox_632 conferred a decrease on the H background in PtoGH9A1_1936 and an increase on the L background in PtoGH9A1_1936 (Fig. 6B and C). These findings are examples of sign epistasis58 and suggest the co-selection of epistatic alleles or protein–protein interactions, although the mechanisms for their generation and maintenance are not clear. These observations were supported by the significant positive correlations in gene expression for each pair of these three genes in our tissue-specific transcript profiling (Fig. 1B).4.3. Future perspectives for MAS breedingThe future of tree improvement will depend on the co-selection of favourable alleles for traits of interest and on the application of combination of haplotypes/genotypes in a manner that effectively overcomes the low levels of LD observed in forest trees.59 Also, genomic selection (GS) is expected to cause a paradigm shift in tree breeding by improving the efficiency and speed of the breeding process.45 Therefore, examining the phenotypic differences among combinations of multiple haplotypes/genotypes for a specific trait (Fig. 5 and Supplementary data S3) provides a foundation for dissecting complex traits through multi-gene or GS in trees. Only 63% of SNPs in haplotypes were identified in the multi-SNP models (Supplementary Tables S6 and S11), consistent with previous observations that haplotype-based tests can detect previously unknown QTL and are thus well supported for unraveling the genetic basis of complex traits.59Populus tomentosa is distributed across a wide geographical area of northern China20 and thus can provide a potential source of region-specific haplotypes (Table 4). These region-specific signatures may reflect, as well as affect, strong regional differentiation in these traits. Probably these fixed loci are likely key to understanding geographic adaptation and may also be targeted in region-based breeding.The present work has identified a number of candidate allelic variants that could be exploited to alter key economic traits for industrial applications. However, the direct use of QTL or association information for MAS breeding has not been successful, chiefly because of the difficulty in transferring associations across populations and species of forest trees.45 Future work should focus on replicated sampling for a larger number of broadly representative ecotypes especially across different environments, as well as considering genetic background or genotype × environment interactions.1 Also, joint mapping with association populations and multiple specific biparental crosses is likely to be extremely powerful for improving map resolution and to improve identification of new alleles. The incorporation of more genes (such as gene family members, transcription factors/regulators, transferases, transporters, kinases, and hydrolases) in shared biosynthetic pathways11 would provide a more complete dissection of the effects of genetic variation on growth and lignocellulosic traits. We believe these studies will gradually drive the application of MAS to selection breeding of trees at the early seedling stage.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the State Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2012CB114506), the National ‘863’ Plan Project (No. 2013AA102702), and the 111 Project (No. B13007).

IntroductionMetagenomic research studies genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled an explosion in sequencing with increased throughput and decreased cost,1 which provides opportunities to generate sequence reads from metagenomes effectively covering highly diverse microbial populations, even for genomes with low coverage. An important step in metagenomic analysis is the assembly of multiple genomes from mixed sequence reads of the multiple species that exist in the sample.2 This can present problems, because, in a microbial community, the number of genomes and the coverage of each genome are initially unknown and the coverage distribution is inhomogeneous and potentially skewed.1–8 Another major difficulty is the short length of sequence reads from next-generation sequencers.2Currently, there are several de novo assemblers that attempt to analyse metagenomic data. MAP,4 Genovo5 and Xgenovo8 are used for rather long sequence reads, while MetaVelvet,2 Meta-IDBA,7 IDBA-UD,9 Ray Meta10 and Omega11 are used for short sequence reads. MAP was designed for the sequence reads produced by Sanger (700–1,000 bp) and 454 sequencing technology (200–500 bp). It uses an improved Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) strategy integrating mate pair information.4 Genovo was designed for 454 sequencing data: it is a metagenomic assembler employing a generative probabilistic model.5 Xgenovo is an extension of Genovo incorporating paired-end information.8 MetaVelvet, Meta-IDBA and IDBA-UD use the de Bruijn graph approach. These assemblers are specifically designed for the huge numbers of short reads generated by Illumina-type next-generation sequencers that enable deep sequencing of the inhomogeneous and divergent species in a microbial community. IDBA-UD is an extension of Meta-IDBA dealing with the uneven sequencing depths of different regions of genomes from different species.9 Both MetaVelvet2 and IDBA-UD9 have been shown to produce longer high-quality assemblies than single-genome assemblers, such as Velvet12,13 and SOAPdenovo2.14 Ray Meta is an extension of the Ray assembler for de novo metagenome assembly, which is scalable because it is highly distributed computing.10 Omega is a metagenomic assembler using overlap graph approach. Omega was most recently proposed for rather longer Illumina sequencing data of microbial communities.11MetaVelvet2 is an extension of a single-genome assembly program (assembler), named Velvet.12,13 The fundamental concept used in MetaVelvet is that a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed sequence reads of multiple species is considered to be equivalent to the union of multiple de Bruijn sub-graphs, each of which is constructed from the sequence reads of individual species. The strategy of MetaVelvet is, first, to decompose a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs and, second, to assemble scaffolds from each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph to build an isolated genome.For the graph disconnection task, MetaVelvet identifies nodes shared between two sub-graphs (named chimeric nodes) and disconnects two sub-graphs by splitting the shared nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Chimeric nodes are shared between the genomes of two closely related species and could represent orthologous sequences, conserved sequences (e.g. rRNA sequences) or horizontal transfer sequences. Chimeric nodes need to be split to obtain independent sub-graphs in a metagenomic assembly.Chimeric nodes need to be split to obtain independent sub-graphs in a metagenomic assembly.To identify chimeric nodes, MetaVelvet uses simple heuristics based on coverage difference and paired-end information, which results in low accuracy and low sensitivity. Our primary goal in this study is to improve chimeric node detection and generate longer accurate scaffolds. Such scaffolds can help to extract more information from the reads, leading to the discovery of more genes and better functional annotation.15 To do this, we have developed an assembler called MetaVelvet-SL, which classifies every node in a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads of multiple species into the following four types by employing supervised machine learning.
The first new procedure in MetaVelvet-SL is to develop the model to classify a node at a crossing point between two paths as chimeric or not. In the process of learning the model, 94 features are extracted for each chimeric node candidate, which is a node at a crossing point that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for learning the classification model. If chimeric nodes can be identified correctly, it means that the de Bruijn graph can be disconnected appropriately by splitting the chimeric nodes. The second new procedure in MetaVelvet-SL is that the expected coverage to extract the unique nodes is calculated for each sub-graph. Based on the assumption that each sub-graph represents a single species, the expected coverage per sub-graph can precisely determine the unique nodes of each species, even those with low coverage. This expected coverage calculation per sub-graph replaces the original MetaVelvet strategy of detecting multiple peaks on the histograms of k-mer frequencies and defining each peak as expected coverage.Chimeric node: A node which is shared between the genomes of two closely related species. This node should be split. Chimeric nodes are illustrated in Fig. 1.Repeat node: A repeat node represents a sequence that occurs several times in the genome. Note that, in multiple genome assembly, nodes at a crossing point between two incoming and two outgoing edges are not necessarily repeats. Such nodes are sometimes chimeric nodes.Unique node: A unique node is one which is neither chimeric nor a repeat. The challenge is to determine the unique nodes of each species correctly.Low-coverage node: In metagenomic assembly, all nodes, even those with low coverage, must be examined to account for species with small populations, but low-coverage nodes must be distinguished from nodes generated by sequencing errors.MetaVelvet-SL consists of two main modules: first, the supervised learning module to develop a model for the classification of chimeric nodes and, second, the assembly module. (The technical details are described in the Materials and methods section.) MetaVelvet-SL also provides a couple of tools to allow users to generate their classification model using prior knowledge about the taxonomic profile of the target microbial community. The taxonomic profile can be inferred from sequence reads by using taxonomic profiling methods, such as MetaPhlAn.16 We have developed a pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL. The pipeline automatically generates a classification model only from metagenomic sequence read data. This customized classification model could be well suited to the assembly of the target metagenomes. MetaVelvet-SL also provides a library of pre-trained classification models for several typical environments, such as soil, deep sea, mud, human blood, intestine and mouth.The source code of MetaVelvet-SL, the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL, and the library of classification models for several typical environments are freely available under the GNU General Public License at http://metavelvet.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp.We conducted computational experiments to evaluate the performance of Metavelvet-SL. The assembly performance of Metavelvet-SL was compared with those of MetaVelvet, the state-of-the-art metagenomic assemblers IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega, and a standard single-genome assembler for massive short sequencing reads, SOAPdenovo2. For simulated data sets, first, we conducted experiments using the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL. The taxonomic profile for the training data set was inferred by MetaPhlAn. Second, to measure the performance of MetaVelvet-SL for different degrees of similarity between the training data set and the assembly data set, we conducted experiments using three levels of training data sets from the highest to the lowest similarity (genus, family and order) to the assembly data sets. For all assembly data sets, MetaVelvet-SL with any training data set generated the highest accurate N50 scores and longest maximum length of accurate scaffolds among the assemblers. (The N50 score is a standard statistical measure that evaluates assembly quality. Scaffolds with higher N50 scores are especially beneficial for the identification of protein-coding genes.2) On real data sets of human gut microbial short read data, sequenced as part of the MetaHIT project17 and the Human Microbiome Project Consortium,18 MetaVelvet-SL using models constructed by supervised learning from the taxonomy profile inferred by MetaPhlAn generated longer scaffolds.2. Materials and methodsA de Bruijn graph is a data structure that compactly represents overlaps between short reads. Several de novo methods based on de Bruijn graphs have been proposed to assemble short reads generated from next-generation sequencers for single genomes and metagenomes.2,7,9,12,13 In a de Bruijn graph, a k-mer (word of length k) is assigned to a node, so the size of a de Bruijn graph is independent of the size of the input of reads. The assembly (reconstruction) of the target genome from the de Bruijn graph can be reduced to finding an Eulerian path that is computable in polynomial time.First, we briefly review the Velvet and MetaVelvet assemblers upon which our method is based. Then we describe MetaVelvet-SL, our extension of Velvet to metagenomic assembly, that utilizes supervised learning.2.1. Brief outline of Velvet and MetaVelvetVelvet is slightly different from other de Bruijn-graph-based assemblers in that each node is attached to a twin node that represents a series of k-mers and their reverse complements for reads from both strands. For each input read, Velvet defines an ordered set of overlapping k-mers. The ordered set is cut whenever an overlap with another read begins or ends. For each uninterrupted ordered subset of the original k-mers, a node is created. Velvet has three functions to manipulate the de Bruijn graph: node merging for simplification, removing tips and removing bubbles for error reduction. Velvet has two functions, Pebble and Rock Band, for constructing the scaffold and for repeat resolution using paired-end and long-read information. In these functions, Velvet distinguishes the unique nodes from the repeat nodes based on the node coverage. A repeat node represents a sequence that occurs several times in the genome and can be described as a node at a crossing point between two paths with multiple incoming and outgoing edges. In multiple genome assembly, such nodes are not necessarily repeats since they can sometimes be shared between the genomes of two closely related species and represent orthologous sequences, conserved sequences (such as rRNA sequences) or horizontal transfer sequences.MetaVelvet is an extension of Velvet for the assembly of metagenomes. The fundamental concept used in MetaVelvet is that a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed sequence reads of multiple species is considered to be equivalent to the union of multiple de Bruijn sub-graphs, each of which is constructed from sequence reads of individual species. MetaVelvet has two functions. First, MetaVelvet decomposes a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs. To do this, MetaVelvet calculates the histogram of k-mer frequencies and detects multiple peaks on the histogram, each peak of which would correspond to one species in a microbial community. Then, MetaVelvet classifies every node into one of the peaks to form sub-graphs composed of nodes belonging to the same peak. MetaVelvet identifies shared (chimeric) nodes between two sub-graphs and disconnects the sub-graphs by splitting the shared nodes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. To distinguish chimeric nodes from repeat nodes, MetaVelvet uses coverage difference and paired-end information. The second function of MetaVelvet builds scaffolds using Velvet's Pebble and Rock Band functions by treating each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph as an isolated species genome.2.2. Extension to MetaVelvet-SLMetaVelvet-SL consists of three major procedures, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Construction of a de Bruijn graph.MetaVelvet-SL constructs a de Bruijn graph from mixed sequence reads of multiple species genomes using Velvet functions.Learning and classification of chimeric nodes.This procedure, first, extracts the chimeric node candidates from the main de Bruijn graph. A chimeric node candidate is defined as a node that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. MetaVelvet-SL utilizes LIBSVM19 to develop a model for classification of chimeric nodes. We used the RBF kernel that is recommended by LIBSVM. Grid search was used to find optimal parameters for the RBF kernel. For the classification, 94 features are extracted for each chimeric node candidate. These features are (Fig. 3): The dinucleotide frequencies in the chimeric node candidate, the two incoming nodes and the two outgoing nodes. Each node has 16 dinucleotide frequencies (AA, AT, AC, AG, TA, … , GG). (16 features × 5 = 80 features).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with higher coverage and the outgoing node with higher coverage (1 feature).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with higher coverage and the outgoing node with lower coverage (1 feature).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with lower coverage and the outgoing node with higher coverage (1 feature).The number of paired-end reads supporting the connection between the incoming node with lower coverage and the outgoing node with lower coverage (1 feature).The ratio between the coverage of each incoming node and the coverage of the chimeric node candidate (2 features).The ratio between the coverage of each outgoing node and the coverage of the chimeric node candidate (2 features).The coverage of the chimeric node candidate (1 feature).The lengths of contigs attached to the chimeric node candidate, the two incoming nodes and the two outgoing nodes (5 features).There are three defined classes. Classes 1 and 2 are the positive classes, which contain chimeric nodes, while Class 3 is the negative class, containing non-chimeric nodes. Class 1 contains chimeric nodes in which the incoming node of higher coverage and the outgoing node of higher coverage come from a same species, and the incoming node of lower coverage and the outgoing node of lower coverage come from another species. Class 2 contains chimeric nodes in which the incoming node of higher coverage and the outgoing node of lower coverage come from a same species, and the incoming node of lower coverage and the outgoing node of higher coverage come from another species. Classes 1 and 2 are illustrated in Fig. 3.One additional task in MetaVelvet-SL is the preparation of the training sample that is required for learning the classification model. MetaVelvet-SL uses prior knowledge about the taxonomic profile (composition) of the target microbial community to generate the training sample. This taxonomic profile can be inferred from sequence reads by using taxonomic profiling methods, such as MetaPhlAn.16 MetaVelvet-SL has the following functions to generate the training sample. First, by using the taxonomic profile, a set of reference genomes that belong to species that are the same as or are closely related to those in the taxonomy profile are collected from the public genome database. Second, the collected reference genome sequences are used to generate simulated sequence reads, and a de Bruijn graph is constructed from the simulated read data. Third, by aligning each node in the de Bruijn graph to the reference genome sequences, it can be determined to which species genome each node belongs. Fourth, each node at a crossing point between two paths in the de Bruijn graph is labelled as Class 1, 2 or 3, generating the training samples.Final assembly tasks:Metavelvet-SL has five major steps for this procedure. Load the main de Bruijn graph which has been constructed.Extract the chimeric node candidates and classify them based on the model that has been learned. After obtaining the classifications of chimeric node candidates, split the chimeric nodes that are classified as being Class 1 or 2.Decompose the de Bruijn graph into connected sub-graphs.Identify unique nodes. The expected coverage of each sub-graph is calculated to determine the unique nodes based on the formula used to identify a unique node in Velvet.12 This formula is given in the Supplementary data.Perform the scaffolding procedure (Pebble and Rock Band procedures). The scaffolding procedure is iterated for each set of unique nodes from the lowest expected coverage to the highest expected coverage.MetaVelvet-SL system consists of three major procedures: (i) construction of a de Bruijn graph; (ii) classification of chimeric nodes and (iii) final assembly tasks.MetaVelvet-SL system consists of three major procedures: (i) construction of a de Bruijn graph; (ii) classification of chimeric nodes and (iii) final assembly tasks.Chimeric nodes fall into two classes. Nodes of the same colour represent the same species. The number in each node represents the coverage value of the node. A contig sequence is also attached to each node.Chimeric nodes fall into two classes. Nodes of the same colour represent the same species. The number in each node represents the coverage value of the node. A contig sequence is also attached to each node.In the implementation, MetaVelvet-SL consists of two main modules: (i) the supervised learning module to develop a model for the classification of chimeric nodes and (ii) the assembly module. We provide both modules for MetaVelvet-SL's users. Users can infer the taxonomic profile from sequence reads using several well-known accurate taxonomic profiling methods, such as MetaPhlAn.16 Alternatively, users can generate a classification model by using prior knowledge about the taxonomy profile of the target microbial community. In either case, the resulting customized model could be well suited to the assembly of the target metagenomes. MetaVelvet-SL also provides a library of pre-trained classification models for several typical environments, such as soil, deep sea, mud, human blood, intestine and mouth.Like other assemblers, the input for the assembly module is a set of reads from metagenomes. A pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL has been developed which allows users to automatically generate a classification model and then assemble their metagenomic short read data. The source code of MetaVelvet-SL, the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL, and the library of learning models for several typical environments are freely available at http://metavelvet.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp.3. Results and discussionThe results of MetaVelvet-SL were compared with those from the original MetaVelvet (version 1.2.02),2 the last version of other state-of-the-art metagenomic assemblers such as IDBA-UD,9 Ray Meta (version 2.3.1)10 and Omega (version 1.0.2),11 and the single-genome assembler for massive short sequencing reads SOAPdenovo2.14 We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance on simulated data sets and on real metagenomic data sets of human gut microbial short read data.3.1. Simulated data setWe generated simulated metagenomic sequence reads using the most frequently used simulator—the DWGSIM component in the DNAA package (available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dnaa). We generated short reads with a length of 80 bp and used the default Illumina sequencing noise, whose error rate is 1%. The average and standard deviation of the insert size for paired-end reads were set at 500 and 50 bp, respectively.To measure the performance for various taxonomic levels of diversity, we generated four types of assembly data sets from distant to closer taxonomic levels (order, family, genus and species). We selected 20 genomes for each data set and generated short read data sets from the 20 genomes. Since the log-normal distribution has been generally used to model microbial abundance distributions,20 we used the log-normal distribution for species abundance. MetaVelvet-SL requires a training data set for learning the classification model. First, we conducted experiments using the pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL. The taxonomic profile for the training data set was inferred by MetaPhlAn. Second, to measure the performance of MetaVelvet-SL for different degrees of similarity between the training data set and the assembly data set, we conducted experiments using three levels of training data sets that contain different reference genomes from the assembly data sets. The three levels of training data sets consist of similarities to the assembly data set, from the highest to the lowest (genus, family and order). The genus-level training data set contains different species but in the same genus from the assembly data set. The family-level training data set contains different genus but in the same family from the assembly data set. The order-level training data set contains different families but in the same order from the assembly data set. The list of selected genomes, the coverage of each genome, the number of reads generated and the length of each reference genome for each training data set and each assembly data set are provided in Supplementary Tables S1–S20.We compared the performance of MetaVelvet-SL with those of MetaVelvet,2 other state-of-the-art superior metagenomic assemblers, IDBA-UD9 with the default parameters for metagenomic assembly, Ray Meta10 with the k-mer size suggested in the Ray Meta paper and Omega11 with the overlap length suggested in the Omega's instruction, and a single-genome assembler, SOAPdenovo214 with the same k-mer size as MetaVelvet and MetaVelvet-SL.We evaluated the assembly performance with Nm50 and three other measurements: the total length, the maximum length and the number of accurate scaffolds (sub-scaffolds not containing any chimeric region). We defined Nm50, the corrected N50 length for metagenomic assembly results. We cut every scaffold at chimeric mis-assembled points into sub-scaffolds so that the sub-scaffolds no longer contain any chimeric region. The usual N50 is defined to indicate the scaffold length such that 50% of the total length of scaffolds lies in scaffolds of this size or larger. Nm50 is N50 length of the sub-scaffolds not containing any chimeric region. Chimeric regions in a scaffold were determined by two steps. First, the best-fit alignments between a scaffold and the set of input reference genomes are calculated using BLAST so that the predicted reference genome for the scaffold can be obtained. Second, if any region in the scaffold is aligned to another reference genome different from the predicted reference genome for the scaffold, the region is determined as a chimeric region. (The technical details are described in the Supplementary data.)The statistics of assembly results are shown in Table 1. The taxonomic profile for the training data set used in MetaVelvet-SL was inferred by MetaPhlAn. For all assembly data sets, MetaVelvet-SL generated higher Nm50 and longer maximum length of scaffolds than MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta, Omega and SOAPdenovo2. The total length of scaffolds is similar among the assemblers. The results showed that MetaVelvet-SL generated longer accurate scaffolds. Statistics of assembly results for simulated data setsAll computations were executed using Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5540 processors (2.53 GHz), with 96-GB physical memory, except for a few cases. Top performances are shown in bold.Statistics of assembly results for simulated data setsAll computations were executed using Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5540 processors (2.53 GHz), with 96-GB physical memory, except for a few cases. Top performances are shown in bold.For all assembly data sets, Ray Meta required the largest computation times, followed by IDBA-UD. The computation times of MetaVelvet-SL increased at low taxonomic levels compared with MetaVelvet. This is mainly because MetaVelvet-SL requires the computation time for learning the classification model and classifying chimeric node candidates the number of which is larger in low taxonomic levels. The genomes become more similar and share more k-mers in low taxonomic levels. Table 2 represents the number of chimeric node candidates in de Bruijn graph constructed from each assembly data set. The species data set has the highest number of chimeric node candidates which is >10 times of the number of chimeric node candidates in the order data set. The number of chimeric node candidates in de Bruijn graph constructed from each assembly data setThe number of chimeric node candidates in de Bruijn graph constructed from each assembly data setThe statistics of assembly of MetaVelvet-SL using different training datasets are shown in Table 3. The models used in MetaVelvet-SL were generated from the taxonomic profiles predicted by MetaPhlAn and three similarity levels of training data sets (genus, family and order) for each assembly data set. There was no significant difference among the assembly results using different training data sets. This result showed that MetaVelvet-SL was robust for the dissimilarity between the training data set and the assembly data set. Statistics of assembly results of MetaVelvet-SL using different training data setsStatistics of assembly results of MetaVelvet-SL using different training data setsSince one of our primary goals in this work is to improve the sensitivity and accuracy for detecting chimeric nodes by supervised learning, we compared the classification capability of chimeric nodes by MetaVelvet-SL and MetaVelvet. The results of the classification are shown in Table 4. We evaluated the sensitivity and the accuracy. Sensitivity is the true positive rate, the percentage of true identified chimeric nodes (positive classes consists of Class 1 and Class 2), while accuracy is the percentage of true results, both true positive (true identified chimeric nodes) and true negative (true identified non-chimeric nodes, consisting of Class 3). As shown in Table 2, all of the assembly data sets have imbalanced classes of chimeric node candidates. Therefore, to avoid inflated performance estimates on imbalanced data sets, we calculated the balanced accuracy too. Balanced accuracy is the average between sensitivity and specificity.21 Specificity is the true negative rate, the percentage of true identified non-chimeric nodes. As shown in Table 4, the balanced accuracy of MetaVelvet-SL, even for the lowest similarity level of training data set (order-level training data set), was higher than MetaVelvet. Classification results for chimeric nodesSen (%) means the percentage of sensitivity; Acc (%) means the percentage of accuracy and BA (%) means the percentage of balanced accuracy.Classification results for chimeric nodesSen (%) means the percentage of sensitivity; Acc (%) means the percentage of accuracy and BA (%) means the percentage of balanced accuracy.3.2. Real data setTo evaluate the performance of MetaVelvet-SL on real metagenomic data, we used human gut microbial data sets. We assembled five human gut microbial data sets: MH0006 (ERS006497), MH0012 (ERS006494) and MH0047 (ERS006592) from the MetaHIT Consortium17 and SRS017227 and SRS018661 from the Human Microbiome Project Consortium.18 Two of the data sets (MH0006 and MH0012) were the deepest and second deepest data sets while another data set, MH0047, is a low-coverage data set.As for the simulated data sets, the real data sets were assembled by MetaVelvet-SL, MetaVelvet,2 IDBA-UD9 with the default parameters for metagenomic assembly, Ray Meta10 with the k-mer size suggested in the Ray Meta paper, Omega11 with the overlap length suggested in the Omega's instruction and SOAPdenovo2.14 The statistics of assembly performances are summarized in Table 5. The classification model for MetaVelvet-SL was obtained by the pipeline using MetaPhlAn to infer the taxonomic profile and then generating the training data set. Assembly results for the real human gut microbial data setsTop performances are shown in bold. MetaVelvet-SL, MetaVelvet and SOAPdenovo2 set the k-mer size at 37 for the MH0006 and MH0047 data sets, 43 for the MH0012 data set and 51 for SRS017227 and SRS018661.Assembly results for the real human gut microbial data setsTop performances are shown in bold.

MetaVelvet-SL outperformed MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta, Omega and SOAPdenovo2 for all data sets in terms of all three of the performance indicators (total length of scaffolds, maximum length of scaffolds and AUC), except for the SRS017227 data sets, SOAPdenovo2 generated slightly longer total length of scaffolds. The identification of chimeric nodes by MetaVelvet-SL using classification models generated from the taxonomic profile inferred by MetaPhlAn is shown in Supplementary Table S21.Comparisons between the taxonomic profile predicted by MetaPhlAn and the taxonomic profile based on assembly results of MetaVelvet-SL using BLAST were accomplished. The NCBI genomic reference sequences were used, which provide stable references, as the database for BLAST searching. The database contains 41,913 organisms as of September 2014 (Release 67). The numbers of species predicted by MetaPhlAn and predicted from the assembly of MetaVelvet-SL are shown in Table 6. The taxonomic profile based on assembly results covered >90% of the taxonomic profile predicted by MetaPhlAn. This result indicated that the assembly capacity of MetaVelvet-SL was high enough to capture the target diverse microbial community. As shown in Table 6, much larger number of species was predicted from assembly results by BLAST than predicted by MetaPhlAn. This is mainly because MetaPhlAn used 2,887 genomes available from the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system, which were much fewer than the number of organisms in the NCBI database used in BLAST searching. The taxonomic profile predicted by MetaPhlAn for each real data set is shown in Supplementary Tables S22–S26, whereas the taxonomy profile predicted from the assembly of MetaVelvet-SL using BLAST is shown in Supplementary Tables S27–S31.

ConclusionExtensive experiments on simulated and real metagenomic data sets showed that MetaVelvet-SL outperformed other metagenomic assemblers MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega as well as a single-genome assembler, SOAPdenovo2.The main strategy in MetaVelvet-SL is to develop a model to classify a candidate node at a crossing point between two incoming and two outgoing edges as a chimeric node or not. We also developed a procedure to identify unique nodes more precisely based on the expected coverage for each sub-graph and considered very low-coverage nodes by determining an appropriate threshold to remove error nodes. Since MetaVelvet-SL needs to learn a model for the classification of chimeric nodes, we have provided a pipeline connecting MetaPhlAn and MetaVelvet-SL, which can generate a classification model and assemble automatically. MetaVelvet-SL also provides a library of pre-trained classification models for several typical environments such as soil, deep sea, mud, human blood, intestine and mouth.MetaVelvet-SL defines a chimeric node as a node that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. In a de Bruijn graph, in single-genome assembly, a node with multiple incoming and outgoing edges represents a repeat node. In multiple genome assembly, such node is not necessarily a repeat since it is sometimes shared between the genomes of two closely related species and represents orthologous sequences, conserved sequences (such as rRNA sequences) or horizontal transfer sequences. In a de Bruijn graph, nodes having multiple incoming and outgoing edges can be divided into (i) those with two incoming edges and two outgoing edges and (ii) those with higher order connectivity (i.e. more than two incoming edges and more than two outgoing edges). The number of nodes having higher order connectivity is much fewer than the number of nodes having two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. We counted the number of nodes having multiple incoming and outgoing edges in de Bruijn graphs for both simulated data sets and real data sets of human gut microbial short read data. On average, the number of nodes having higher order connectivity is only 1.79% of the number of nodes having two incoming edges and two outgoing edges. The number of nodes for each data set is provided in Supplementary Table S32. Although MetaVelvet-SL defines a candidate for a chimeric node as a node that has two incoming edges and two outgoing edges, MetaVelvet-SL outperformed the other metagenomic assemblers MetaVelvet, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega, and also a single genome assembler, SOAPdenovo2. We continue to consider the impact of higher order connectivity.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research in Innovative Areas No. 221S0002 and Scientific Research (A) No. 23241066 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

IntroductionTransposable elements (TEs) constitute a significant fraction of plant genomes and are considered to be one of the major forces driving genome evolution. Further, TEs are capable of changing its position in the genome through transposition and so they are called as ‘jumping genes’. Each transposition event generates new variability by creating mutations and altering the genome size of a cell. On the basis of their mode of replication and transposition, the TEs are categorized as Class I and Class II. The Class I includes retrotransposons that produce RNA intermediates which are copied into DNA and then inserted into new locations within the genome while Class II TEs are DNA transposons that move directly by a ‘cut and paste’ mechanism.1 Class I elements are further categorized into two subclasses, namely (i) LTR retrotransposons, flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs), and (2) non-LTR elements which comprise Long-Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) and Short-Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs). Retrotransposons are the most abundant mobile elements found in plant genomes,2 as the replicative mode of retroelement transposition enables the LTR retrotransposon to accrue high copy number. Indeed, in some grasses, LTR retrotransposons represent up to 90% of the genome.2,3 They constitute for >50% of the maize genome,4,5 14% of the Arabidopsis genome6 and up to 90% of the wheat genome.7 Similar to other plants, grass genomes are also rich in repetitive elements derived from retrotransposons which get amplified themselves in the genome through an RNA-mediated retrotransposition process.The wide distribution of TEs in the plant genome, abundance and their variable arrangement pattern among closely related species facilitates their use as informative marker to assess genetic diversity in plant breeding programmes. TEs-based marker system takes advantage of their transpositional activity by which they cause insertions and hence variations; and also, the presence of conserved domains facilitates designing of PCR primers. So far, five classes of TE junction-based markers have been developed which include Repeat Junction Markers (RJMs), Repeat Junction-Junction Markers (RJJMs), Insertion Site-Based Polymorphism (ISBP), Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism (IRAP) and Retrotransposon-Based Insertion Polymorphism (RBIP).8 Among these, RJMs are unique in the sense that cover both TE and gene region and hence can be useful in functional genomic studies. Development and utilization of very few insertional polymorphism-based markers were demonstrated in grass species. Wanjugi et al.9 exploited the unique and abundant TE insertion junction regions identified from diploid Aegilops tauschii to develop genome-specific repeat DNA junction markers (RJMs) for use in hexaploid wheat. Identification of repeat junctions and large-scale development of TE-based marker was also successfully performed in barley.10Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) is a C4 Panicoid grass with smaller genome (~515 Mb), in-breeding and short life cycle.11,12 These attributes along with its genetic close-relatedness to other millets, cereals and several biofuel crops have made foxtail millet a model crop.13,14 The release of draft genome sequence by BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute), China,15 and Joint Genome Institute (JGI) of the Department of Energy, USA,16 had expedited the high-throughput analysis of genome and large-scale development of genomic resources such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs),17,18 EST-derived SSRs19 and intron length polymorphic markers (ILPs).20 Considering the importance of foxtail millet, functional significance of TEs and the necessity of TE-based markers in genotyping applications, this study was performed to identify the different classes of TEs and develop molecular markers by utilizing the sequence information of TEs. Further, the developed resources are made available to the global research community through open access, web-based Foxtail millet Transposable Element-based Marker Database (FmTEMDb; http://59.163.192.83/ltrdb/index.html).2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification of full-length retrotransposons and estimation of insertion timeGenomic sequence of foxtail millet was retrieved from Phytozome (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v9.0/Sitalica/), and the full-length retrotransposons were predicted using LTR_FINDER tool (http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/ltr_finder/).21 The same tool was used to identify the Target Site Repeat (TSR), Primer Binding Site (PBS) and Polypurine Tract (PPT), Integrase [IN (core) and IN (c-term)] and RNaseH (RH) region for each predicted retrotransposon. 3' and 5' LTRs were identified based on their start and end (TG and CA, respectively) using in-house Perl script with the following parameters; LTR sequence length is 100–3,500 bp, and maximum distance between LTRs is 10,000 bp.The 3' and 5' LTR sequences of the same Copia- and Gypsy-type retrotransposons were aligned by ClustalW22 using default parameters, and the pairwise sequence divergence was calculated using the Ka/Ks calculator (https://code.google.com/p/kaks-calculator/wiki/KaKs_Calculator). Based on NG parameter model,23 the Ka and Ks, the numbers of synonymous (S) and non-synonymous (N) sites (S + N = n), and the numbers of synonymous (Sd) and non-synonymous (Nd) substitutions (Sd + Nd = m) were estimated. The time of insertion was calculated as described by Tamura et al.242.2. Identification of DNA transposonsDNA transposons were identified by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker) with reference to repeat databases including Maize Transposable Element Database (maize TEDB), TIGR Gramineae Repeats v2.0, TIGR Triticum Repeats v3.0, TIGR Oryza Repeats v3.3, TIGR Hordeum Repeats v3.0, TIGR Sorghum Repeats v3.0 and Triticeae repeat (TREP) sequence database.8 BLAST search was performed in RepeatMasker using default parameters with ‘do not mask simple repeats or low-complex DNA’ option to avoid the regions of low complexity, such as simple tandem repeats, polypurines and AT-rich regions that can lead to spurious matches in database searches.2.3. Insertion of transposons into intronic regions and functional annotation of genes interrupted with TEsThe data of intronic regions were obtained from the gff file of S. italica available in Phytozome. The intronic sequences were further annotated for different classes of transposons, and nested TEs were predicted using RepeatMasker.8 Further, the genes interrupted with retrotransposons were annotated with the BLASTX algorithm using Blast2GO25 under expected value (e-value) of 1.0e-10 and minimal length cut-off value of 33 to exclude hits with minor local alignments. The Blast2GO annotation tool was used to assign the most probable Gene ontology (GO) terms to the genes, and the results were visualized by WEGO tool (Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot).262.4. Transcriptional activation of TEs in various tissues of foxtail milletTo confirm the transcriptional activities of TEs in foxtail millet, the Illumina RNA-HiSeq data of four tissues, namely spica, stem, leaf and root were retrieved from European Nucleotide Archive [SRX128226 (spica); SRX128225 (stem); SRX128224 (leaf); SRX128223 (root)].27 The RNA-seq data were then filtered and mapped onto various classes of TEs using Bowtie 1.0.0 (http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml). The mapped reads were analysed in all the four tissues of foxtail millet.2.5. Primer designing, PCR amplification and detection of polymorphismsUnique repeat junctions in the foxtail millet TEs were identified by executing both BLASTN search and repeat junction finding algorithm of RJPrimers pipeline v1.0 (http://probes.pw.usda.gov/RJPrimers/). The fully annotated repeat databases chosen for executing BLASTN search and identification of repeat junctions were maize TEDB (1313 sequences), TIGR Gramineae Repeats v2.0 (2,942 sequences), TIGR Triticum Repeats v3.0 (452 sequences), TIGR Oryza Repeats v3.3 (21,807 sequences), TIGR Hordeum Repeats v3.0 (630 sequences), TIGR Sorghum Repeats v3.0 (120 sequences) and TREP sequence database. E-value cut-off was set to 1e-50 for the top hit and 1e-5 was used as maximum for all the hits to reduce the detection of false-positive repeat junctions. Primer3 tool was used for designing primer pairs for the repeat junctions (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/).The primers were further validated in 96 S. italica accessions and 3 wild accessions (one each from Setaria viridis, Setaria sphacelata and Setaria verticillata) (Supplementary Table S1). Genomic DNA was extracted from the lyophilized tissue of young leaves as described by Pandey et al.17 The DNA was quantified using 0.8% agarose gel by comparing with <U+03BB>-HindIII DNA (Fermentas) as marker. The PCR amplification reactions were performed in a 25 µl reaction volume containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 1× Taq buffer, 2 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (Promega), 0.5 mM each of the forward and reverse primers and four units of Taq polymerase (Biotools). The PCR reactions were performed in iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) and with one cycle of 3 min at 94°C, 34 cycles of 60 s at 94°C, 60 s at 60°C, 1.30 min at 72°C and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel. The DNA bands were eluted from the gel using Real Genomics Hi Yield Gel/PCR Fragments Extraction Kit (Real Biotech Corporation) and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a competent cells, and the plasmids were isolated from positive clones using AccuPrep Plasmid MiniPrep DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer) following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were sequenced in automated sequencer (3730xI DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) using M13 forward and reverse primers. The sequence information was used to construct multiple sequence alignment using TARGeT-based multiple sequence aligner.282.6. Phylogenetic and Bayesian model-based population structure analysisThe marker profiles of 99 accessions of Setaria species were scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of the amplicon and a binary matrix was generated. Co-migrating bands were assumed to be originated from the same genetic locus. Binary matrix was analysed using the DARwin software v5.0.158.29 Using pairwise similarity matrix of Jaccard's coefficient, the level of genetic diversity among the 99 accessions was calculated and an unweighted neighbour-joining (UNJ) tree was constructed with a bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates.30The existence of a structure was assessed using STRUCTURE 2.3.3 software,31 based on Bayesian model-based cluster analysis. The method used 99 accessions of Setaria to infer the fraction of an individual accession's genetic ancestry that belongs to a population, for a given number of populations (K). The genotype of each individual accession is a function of the allele frequencies in the K populations (clusters) and the proportion of its genotype drawn from each of the K populations (qk). The ‘no admixture model’ was tested, as recommended for dominant loci and a permutation test using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was applied to examine the population structure. For each run, the burn-in time was 2,00,000, and the number of replications was 2,00,000.32 The MCMC chain was run six times, using a correlated allele frequency model (prior mean is 0.01, prior SD = 0.05 and Lambda set at 1.0 in the advance option of the STRUCTURE program). Since it was difficult to choose the ‘correct’ K from the Ln probability of data [Ln P(D)], the <U+0394>K values were estimated as per the procedure suggested by Evanno et al.33 All the calculations pertaining to assignment of optimum K according to Evanno et al.33 were performed using Structure Harvester v0.9.94 software (http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/structureHarvester/). Maximum peak of <U+0394>K was considered as true cluster number.2.7. Comparative mapping of TEs of foxtail millet with related grass speciesThe foxtail millet TE sequences were BLASTN searched against the genomes of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon in Phytozome using default parameters. The hits with >80% similarity were taken, and the orthologues were confirmed by BLAST searching against the respective repeat databases. The comparative physical map was visualized using Circos v0.55 (http://circos.ca).342.8. Database constructionTo facilitate wider usage of these annotated TEs and the respective markers, a web-based open access database was constructed using open source softwares (Apache, PHP and MySQL). The user friendly web interface allows easy access of the TEs and TE-based marker information such as the sequences of forward and reverse primers, its respective length, melting temperature (°C) and the status of wet-lab validation. Further, the CMap feature has been integrated in the database, which enables the user to visualize the physical map of the TEs and TE-based marker (either chromosome-wise or primer types-wise). The CMap interface also allows the user to visualize the comparative map of TEs between foxtail millet chromosomes and chromosomes of sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of Class I TEs in foxtail milletClass I TEs include retrotransposons that transpose via an RNA intermediate.35 Retrotransposons are divided into two major subclasses, namely LTR retrotransposons and the non-LTR retrotransposons, which differ in their structure and transposition cycle. LTRs are further classified into Copia-like and Gypsy-like, whereas non-LTRs are categorized as LINEs and SINEs. In foxtail millet, 2,608 intact full-length LTRs were predicted using LTR_FINDER tool. These LTRs were further analysed for the presence of coding regions such as ‘gag’ that encodes capsid-like protein, ‘pol’ encoding for protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase enzymes, and ‘env’ coding for envelope protein. In addition, the sequences from coding region of some retrotransposons were extracted using in-house Perl script and were confirmed with BLASTX analysis against the non-redundant database of NCBI.Of the 2,608 LTRs, 1,038 were found to be full-length Copia type and 1,570 were full-length Gypsy type (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). In addition, partial or solo Copia-type (10,118) and Gypsy-type (23,293) retrotransposons were also identified (Fig. 1; Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). The length of Copia elements ranged from 1.4 to 23.9 kb with a mean of 7,708.36 bp, whereas the length of Gypsy-type LTRs varied from 1.8 to 25.9 kb with a mean of 11,776.3 bp. The full-length LTRs were defined by the presence of two LTRs (5' and 3'; both starts and ends with TG and CA, respectively) flanking the coding regions, and PBS and PPT that vary depending on the TE family, ranging between 20 and 15 bp in length (Supplementary Fig. S2). Both the 3' and 5' LTR sequences of all LTR-type retrotransposons were extracted using in-house Perl script and analysed. The length of 3' LTRs for Copia-type retrotransposons ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 kb with a mean length of 0.99 kb, whereas the length of Gypsy-type retrotransposons varied from 0.1 to 3.46 kb with a mean of 1.14 kb. Similarly, variations in length were also observed in 5' LTRs of both Copia- and Gypsy-type retrotransposons. The length ranged from 0.1 to 3.4 kb with a mean length of 0.99 kb for Copia and 0.1 to 3.48 kb with a mean of 1.14 kb for Gypsy (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Distribution of different classes of TEs across the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet.Distribution of different classes of TEs across the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet.The non-LTRs, distinguished from LTRs by the respective absence of LTRs, were categorized as LINEs and SINEs. A total of 3,653 LINEs and 53 SINEs were identified in foxtail millet genome (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Length of LINEs ranged from 0.1 to 14.0 kb with a mean length of 1.3 kb, while the length of SINEs varied from 0.1 to 1.8 kb with a mean length of 1.5 kb.3.2. Chromosomal distribution of Class I TEs in foxtail milletAll the four subclasses of Class I TEs were evidenced to be distributed in all the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2). A maximum of Copia-type TEs are present in chromosome 8 (~14%; ~3.6 TEs per Mb) and minimum in chromosome 7 (6.5%; ~2 TEs per Mb). Average distribution of Copia-type TE in foxtail millet genome is 2.6 per Mb (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). In case of Gypsy, a maximum of 199 elements were present in chromosome 4 (~13%) and minimum in chromosome 7 (~8%). Maximum density of Gypsy-type TEs was found in chromosome 6 (~5 per Mb) and minimum was observed in chromosome 9 (~3 per Mb) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). Foxtail millet chromosome 9 comprised the maximum number of LINEs (532; 14.5%) and chromosome 2 had the minimum (233; ~5%). The density of LINEs was maximum in chromosome 6 (10.5 per Mb) and minimum in chromosome 2 (~5 per Mb) (Supplementary Table S6). In case of SINEs, maximum of these elements were observed in chromosome 11 (~21%) and minimum in chromosome 7 (~6%) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S7).3.3. Estimation of LTR insertion timeInsertion time of LTRs in the foxtail millet genome was calculated to predict the time taken for the occurrence of each transposition events, which facilitates the movement of LTRs from one position to another in the genome. For Copia-type elements, the distribution of the divergence time ranged from 0.000767 to 3.93273 MYA (million years ago) with a mean value of 1.28 MYA (Supplementary Table S8). The distribution of the divergence time for Gypsy-type retrotransposons was estimated to be in a range of 0.000371–6.7687 MYA with a mean value of 0.82 (Supplementary Table S9). These results are in agreement with the previous studies where the insertion timings are reported in a range of 0.00–6.00 MYA.36–38 In rice, it was reported that 263 LTR-RTs (5%) have insertion dates <14,000 yrs old, which is approximately the time of rice domestication.39–41 Further, the Ka/Ks ratios estimated as >1 signified that LTRs have underwent positive selection. This positive selection at the DNA level could have resulted from the ability of TE sequences to replicate faster than the host genome.3.4. Identification of Class II type TEs and its distribution in foxtail millet genomeA total of 24,386 DNA transposons belonging to Class II type TEs were identified in foxtail millet (Supplementary Table S10). The lengths of these TEs varied from 0.1 to 14.7 kb with a mean length of 0.78 kb. The 22,860 DNA transposons were further classified into 10 subclasses, namely DNA/CMC-EnSpm, DNA/En-Spm, DNA/hAT-Ac, DNA/hAT-Tag1, DNA/hAT-Tip100, DNA/MULE-MuDR, DNA/PIF-Harbinger, DNA/TcMar-Stowaway, RC/Helitron and DNA/Tourist based on similarity search with known TEs reported in other plant species. Of these, DNA/PIF-Harbinger accounts for the highest of Class II type TEs (12,758; ~52%), followed by DNA/CMC-EnSpm (4,979; ~20%). DNA/hAT-Tag1 (31) and DNA/Tourist (28) were found to be least in number, amounting for 0.1% of the Class II TEs identified in foxtail millet (Supplementary Table S10).Chromosomal distribution data of these 24,386 DNA transposons revealed that a maximum of 3,901 were present in chromosome 9 (16%) and minimum in chromosome 2 (1,366; ~28%) (Fig. 1). Higher density of Class II TEs was evidenced in chromosome 5 (~71 per Mb) and lower in chromosome 2 (~28 per Mb) with an average density of 61 DNA transposons per Mb (Supplementary Table S10).3.5. Transcriptional activation of TEs in various tissues of foxtail milletRetrotransposons were found to be transcriptionally active in all the four tissues, namely leaf, root, spica and stem (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables S11–S15). A maximum of Copia-type TEs (~80%) matched with RNA-HiSeq reads which revealed that Copia-type TEs were prevalently expressed in tissues of foxtail millet. Approximately 49% of Gypsy-type retrotransposons matched with RNA-HiSeq reads. Similarly, ~10% LINEs, ~15% SINEs and ~16% DNA transposons matched with the expressed reads (Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables S11–S15).

Development of TE-based markersAll the 30,706 identified foxtail millet TEs were searched for potential repeat junctions (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4). Based on repeat junction, six types of primers were designed, namely retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP), IRAP, RJM, RJJM, ISBP and retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) (Supplementary Tables S16–S21). Hence, a total of 20,278 primers were successfully designed, of which maximum was the ISBP (7,401; ~36%) followed by RBIP (4,801; ~24%). Only 57 primers could be designed for REMAP (~0.2%). The numbers of IRAP, RJM and RJJM primers were 3,239 (~16%), 4,451 (~22%) and 329 (~2%), respectively (Supplementary Tables S16–S21). Although these markers were expected to include the fragments between the TE sequence on one side and the TE-inserted unique gene sequence on the other, some of the primers were evidenced to show same conformation at different locations in foxtail millet genome. This generation of duplications is due to the RJPrimer tool, using which the TE-based markers were developed.Although primers could not be designed for LINEs and SINEs using Primer3 because of the limitations in their lengths, three RJM primers were manually designed for LINEs by aligning foxtail millet CDS on genomic sequences using GeneSeqer tool.42 In addition, the TE-based forward and reverse primers were BLAST searched with available draft foxtail millet chromosomal pseudomolecule sequences to know their uniqueness/specificity in the foxtail genome. The results indicated that 1,522 (~21%) of ISBP, 1,012 (~21%) of RBIP, 712 (~16%) of RJM, 546 (~17%) of IRAP, 91 (~28%) of RJJM and 8 (~14%) of REMAP were unique.3.7. Amplification and polymorphic potential of TE-based markersA total of 134 RJM primers were selected representing the nine chromosomes of foxtail millet for validation. Initially, all the 134 primer pairs were amplified in 96 accessions of S. italica and 3 wild Setaria (S. viridis, S. sphacelata and S. verticillata) accessions to examine the insertional polymorphism among these accessions (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S22). Of these, 104 (~78%) amplified unique single allele, whereas 30 primers (~22%) amplified more than single allele and was evidenced to be polymorphic. The amplicons showing polymorphism were sequenced and compared with the reference genome available in Phytozome to confirm whether all the sequences of 30 polymorphic primer pairs show complete similarity with amplified sequences (Fig. 4; Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). The relative frequencies of Gene Ontology (GO) hits assigned to the GO functional categories; Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component for Setaria italica genes which were interrupted with transposable elements. ‘DNA TEs’ indicates DNA transposons; ‘LTR’ represents Copia and Gypsy-type retrotransposons and ‘NonLTR’ indicates LINEs and SINEs.The relative frequencies of Gene Ontology (GO) hits assigned to the GO functional categories; Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component for Setaria italica genes which were interrupted with transposable elements. ‘DNA TEs’ indicates DNA transposons; ‘LTR’ represents Copia and Gypsy-type retrotransposons and ‘NonLTR’ indicates LINEs and SINEs.Frequency of transcriptionally active transposable elements present in four tissues of foxtail millet.Frequency of transcriptionally active transposable elements present in four tissues of foxtail millet.3.8. Identification of TEs present in intronic regions and functional annotation of genes interrupted with TEsTEs are reported to play a crucial role in gene evolution by disrupting the genes. Upon getting integrated into the genome, TEs mediate chromosomal rearrangements, leading to accumulation of mutations and ultimately become transpositionally inactive. The presence of TEs was searched in the introns of 45,735 protein-coding genes of foxtail millet. Approximately 12% genes of foxtail millet were found to be integrated with TEs, of which ~0.75% genes had Copia-type retrotransposons, ~1% genes had Gypsy type, ~3% genes had LINEs and ~6% genes were interrupted with DNA transposons (Table 1). LINEs (1,497 interrupted genes) and DNA transposons (830 genes with PIF-Harbinger and 635 genes with TcMar-Stowaway) were observed to be predominantly integrated within genic region. Similar phenomenon of TE insertion in intronic region was also observed in sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium (Fig. 5; Table 1). Further, the patterns of the nested TEs (the insertion of TEs into pre-existing TEs) for all the types of retrotransposons were analysed. A total of 4,927 inserted TEs were found to be inserted within 2,078 host TEs, thus revealing that >1 TE inserted into a single host TE. Of the total inserted TEs, 6.3% (308) was found to be inserted in RC/Helitron, 13.66% (673) in DNA/CMC-EnSpm, 11.26% (555) in DNA/En-Spm, 0.37% (18) in DNA/hAT-Ac, 0.30% (15) in DNA/MULE-MuDR, 0.41% (20) in DNA/TcMar-Stowaway, 3.75% (185) in DNA/PIF-Harbinger, 0.26%, (13) in DNA/Tourist, 0.52% (26) in LINE/L1, 26.91% (1,326) in Copia and 36.28% (1,788) in Gypsy (Supplementary Fig. S8). It has been reported that the movement of TEs in genomes results in the occurrence of nested TEs.43 These nested TEs in foxtail millet genome may negatively influence genome expansion and enrich the diversity of gene expression or regulation.

The analysis revealed that predominant genes were involved in organ development (Fig. 6). Further chromatin regulatory genes containing SET domain gene family and AGO gene family which are the components of RNAi machinery were identified as the genes interrupted with TEs. Three genes namely RJM3, RJM4 and RJM7 that are interrupted with TEs were validated in Setaria species. Of these, RJM7 showed insertion of LINE-type transposons in 21st intron of EIF2ALPHA KINASE gene in S. italica as it acts as Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase (eif2-alpha kinase) in plants (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, there was no insertional signature observed in S. verticillata.

Phylogenetic and Bayesian model-based population structure analysisTo analyse the diversity among diverse germplasm of 99 Setaria accessions, a dendogram was generated from a similarity matrix using NJ clustering method. Unrooted NJ method resolved them into four major subgroups. Group 1 contains the largest number of individuals that were mostly originated from USA, whereas Group 2 comprises the accessions from India. Groups 3 and 4 predominantly comprise accessions from USA and China, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9).The TE-based marker data of 99 accessions of Setaria were also analyzed for the genetic structure. The software was run for the number of fixed subgroups (K) from 2 to 12, and more than three runs were performed for each K (Supplementary Table S23) and <U+0394>K was estimated. Structure Harvester software based on Evanno method has delineated the optimum number of K as 4 (Supplementary Fig. S10; Supplementary Table S24). Similar to Hierarchical analysis, Bayesian model-based cluster analysis revealed that the 99 individuals were clustered into four groups, A–D (K = 4) (Supplementary Fig. S11). These individuals were further classified into the ones with ‘pure’ ancestry (where >80% of their inferred ancestry was derived from only one of the clusters) and ‘mixed ancestry’ or ‘admixtures’ (where >20% of inferred ancestry was derived from more than one cluster). Majority of the accessions (76) belonged to the ‘pure’ ancestry (Supplementary Table S25). The remaining accessions were of ‘mixed’ ancestry. A comparison of the results from Bayesian model-based STRUCTURE analysis with the NJ-based tree revealed considerable congruence. Two out of the four STRUCTURE-based clusters matched with the specific groups of the NJ-based tree. However, Clusters 2 and 3 were the exceptions, where the accessions from NJ-based group were not contributed to correspondence group. By understanding the ISBP due to RJM, analysing the evolutionary aspects is possible using phylogenetic approach. These markers were also proved successful in analysing genetic diversity analysis and construction of physical and genetic linkage maps in wheat.9 The major advantage of RJM is that it indicates the insertion polymorphism where different allelic states (the presence and absence of the transposon insertion) at a locus are revealed.44 Because of this unique advantage, RJMs are used in genetic, physical and radiation mapping studies.93.10. TE-based comparative mapping between foxtail millet and related grass speciesTE-based comparative orthologous relationships between 30,706 foxtail millet TEs and TEs of sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium were analysed (Fig. 7; Supplementary Tables S26–S29). Of the 30,706 TEs, 14,008 (~46%) showed maximum synteny with sorghum, 12,485 (~40%) with maize, 9,634 (~31%) with rice and 1,313 (~4%) with Brachypodium. The data revealed a decrease in the degree of synteny with respect to increase in the phylogenetic distance. Interestingly, TEs mapped in foxtail millet chromosome 9 showed highest synteny with all the four grass species [2,419 (~17%) with sorghum, 2,103 (~17%) with maize, 1,666 (~17%) with rice and 205 (~16%) with Brachypodium] (Fig. 7). Similarly, TEs mapped in chromosome 2 of foxtail millet showed minimum synteny with all the four grasses [777 (~5%) with sorghum, 715 (~6%) with maize, 510 (~5%) with rice and 69 (~5%) with Brachypodium] (Supplementary Tables S26–S29). The wider genetic distances and low syntenic relationships among foxtail millet and other monocot genomes based on TE-based markers could be explained either through low conservation of TEs and/or species-specific transpositions. The independent evolutionary and divergence patterns of TEs have led to evolve unique transposition patterns in diverse crop lineages for generation of species-specific TEs resulting in their low conservation and synteny. This TE-based comparative mapping provides insights on the TEs in sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium and would enable map-based isolation and analysis of TEs in these grass species.

Online web-resource implementation and user interfaceUsing the three-level schema of Apache, PHP and MySQL, open access Foxtail millet Transposable Element-based Marker Database (FmTEMDb; http://59.163.192.83/ltrdb/index.html) was constructed (Fig. 8). The database is a repository of complete TE data along with respective marker information. The details of TEs can be searched using six different search criteria such as TE IDs, type of TE, chromosome, etc. For each TE, the database will provide preliminary information of TE ID, chromosomal location, orientation of the coding strand, subclass (if any) and hyperlinks to retrieve the primers and view the physical map. Under primer details, the database will display the primer type, junction, TE type, TE source, strand orientation, start and end position of primers, melting temperature and GC percentage. The CMap feature of FmTEMDb allows the interactive visualization of physical and comparative map of TEs (Fig. 9). The map could be browsed either by type of TE or chromosome-wise. Further, all the data stored in the database are available for download. Although the database is user friendly, a tutorial is also provided (Supplementary Fig. S12).

ConclusionsTEs are one of the major components of the plant genome, and they are reported to play a crucial role in functional genome diversity and phenotypic variations. Hence, analysing the organization of TEs in the genome would enable the researchers in dissecting the interplay between TEs and nearby gene expression which would enhance understanding the role of TEs in shaping the crop phenotypic diversity. The advent of next-generation sequencing and high-throughput sequence analysis platforms had facilitated the whole-genome sequencing and analysis of important crop plants. With the availability of genome sequence information, it is possible to investigate the organization of TEs in the genome. Further, the polymorphic potential of several types of TEs such as retrotransposons had encouraged the development of TE-based molecular markers that are useful for high-throughput genotyping applications.45 The major cause of genome evolution is because of the TEs, which has generated genetic diversity upon which selection can act. Further, TE transposition is also an important factor for nucleotide-base mutation rate, and thus, TEs serve as potential agents of evolutionary changes. TEs also induce phenotypic changes associated with domestication or diversification of cultivated plants. It also causes gene disruption by creating insertion or deletion in exon or intron region, which could be the major force towards the differential expression and regulation of gene.Foxtail millet is a model crop for studying the genetics and genomics of several millets, cereals and bioenergy grasses.13,14 Hence, identifying the TEs, classifying and analysing its organization, and developing TE-based molecular markers in foxtail millet would serve as an important resource for millets, cereals and bioenergy genomics. Considering this, the present study was performed to identify a total of 30,706 TEs in foxtail millet and is classified into respective classes and subclasses. Further, the TEs present in intronic regions were identified, and functional annotation of respective genes was performed. Using the RNA-sequence data of four tissues, the transcriptional activation of TEs was analysed, and comparative physical mapping of foxtail millet TEs with sorghum, maize, rice and Brachypodium was performed. From 30,706 TEs, 20,278 markers were developed which belonged to six types. Of these, 134 RJMs were screened in 96 accessions of S. italica and 3 wild Setaria accessions of which 30 showed polymorphism. To provide the developed TE information to the global science community, a web-based, open access database (FmTEMDb; http://59.163.192.83/ltrdb/index.html) was constructed. Promisingly, the TE data of foxtail millet along with the large-scale marker information reported in this study will be a valuable resource for foxtail millet genomic studies including genomic selection, fine mapping and phylogenetic analysis. Further, this would also assist in gaining new insights on the genome structure of this model crop as well as the potential of TEs in genetic variation studies.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe authors' work in this area was supported by the core grant of National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi, India.

IntroductionThe cultivation of olive trees (Olea europaea L.) dates back to ancient times. Mythology ascribes the domestication of this species to a divine will: the cultivation of the tree and the treatment of the drupe were taught to the people of Athens by the goddess Athena. In recent years, olive cultivation has been subjected to a growing interest because of the economic, cultural, and ecological importance of olive trees in the Mediterranean area. This interest has grown even outside the Mediterranean area because of health properties of olive oil, related to its composition of fatty acids and secondary metabolites.1From a genetic point of view, this renewed interest in olive tree cultivation has primarily resulted in data on the large genetic variability occurring within O. europaea and related species.2 Such a large genetic variability can be explained by the prevalent self-incompatibility of olive genotypes, which results in high levels of heterozygosis and DNA polymorphisms. Owing to spontaneous crossings and to the appearance of bud sports over the course of millennia, numerous new genotypes appeared, the best of which were fixed by agamic propagation.3Olea europaea L. has a medium-sized haploid genome of 1.4 Gb,4 whose structure has been long uncharacterized. Concerning the repetitive component of the genome, before 2014 only four tandem repeat sequences had been characterized and localized by cytological hybridization on chromosomes.5–7 In addition, a few putative retrotransposon (RE) fragments were isolated and sequenced.8,9After sequencing the whole genome of some plant species, the knowledge of the structure and organization of plant genomes has been substantially improved, leading to the view that genome evolution of angiosperms has been accompanied—and possibly promoted—by polyploidization events and differential amplification of repetitive DNA.10The repetitive DNA in plants is mainly represented by Class I transposons (REs) that are capable of replicating through a ‘copy and paste’ mechanism and can potentially increase the genome size of their host species in a very short time.11Among REs, elements that contain direct long terminal repeats (LTRs) are predominant in plants. LTR-REs vary in size from a few hundred base pairs to over 10 kb, with LTRs that usually contain the promoter and RNA processing signals.12 Internal to the 5' and 3' LTRs, respectively, are the primer-binding site (PBS) and the polypurine tract (PPT), which provide the signals for reverse transcription of RE transcripts into the cDNA that will be reintegrated into the genome. In autonomous elements, these two sequence sites flank the region that contains ORFs for Gag, a structural protein of the virus-like particles, and for Pol. Pol encodes a polyprotein with protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), RNaseH, and integrase enzyme domains, which are required for the replication and the integration of the elements in the host chromosomes.LTR-REs belong to two major superfamilies, called Gypsy and Copia, differing in the position of the integrase domain within the encoded polyprotein.The occurrence of different RE families, characterized by sequence variability in both the coding, transcribed portion and the LTRs13 has been reported in several genomes. These families were probably generated by the replicative mechanism of LTR-REs, coupled with the error-prone nature of transcription and reverse transcription. RE families have amplified differentially in different lineages within plant genera or even within a single species (for example, in maize) over a time-span of <1 million yrs (MY).14 Similar events have taken place in several cereal species: for example, in the genome of Sorghum bicolor, the insertion of transposable elements and their removal by unequal recombination or by DNA loss resulted in an average RE insertion age of 0.8 MY, with 50% of the detected elements having inserted within the last 500,000 yrs.15 Such processes have also been detected in some dicots, although to a less dramatic extent.11,16,17Recently, next-generation sequencing technologies and different computational procedures have been used to gain a general insight into the composition of the olive genome and its repetitive fraction.18 Illumina and 454 reads from genomic DNA were assembled following different procedures, obtaining >200,000 differently redundant contigs, with a mean length of >1,000 nt. By combining identification and mapping of repeated sequences, it was established that tandem repeats represent a very large portion of the olive genome (~31%), consisting of six main families of different length. The other large redundant class in the olive genome is represented by transposable elements, especially LTR-REs.18The identification and characterization of olive LTR-REs were, however, difficult because of the lack of large sequenced genomic regions. For example, an accurate dating of amplification events of the LTR-RE component requires a comparison of the two LTR sequences from individual, full-length elements.19In the frame of a project aimed to sequence the olive genome, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was produced. A number of BAC clones were pooled and then sequenced using the Illumina procedure. These sequences were assembled and the resulting contigs analysed to identify full-length LTR-REs, allowing the first characterization of such elements in olive, especially in relation to their insertion age.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequencing of BAC clonesA BAC library from O. europaea cv. Leccino was produced as follows. Cell nuclei were isolated from the youngest leaves of the olive tree following the protocol of Doležel et al.20 Briefly, the leaves were fixed for 20 min at 5°C in 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and immediately afterwards chopped by a razor blade in ice-cold isolation buffer (15 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 130 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM spermine, 1 mM spermidine, 45 mM ß-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 9.4). The suspension of released nuclei was passed through a 50-µm-pore nylon mesh to remove large tissue and cellular fragments, and was then stained using DAPI (2 µg/ml). Intact nuclei were sorted using flow cytometry and used to prepare high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA.21 HMW DNA of 1.8 million nuclei (~5.4 µg DNA) was used to construct a large insert library cloned in pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) as previously described.22We shotgun-sequenced 12 pools each formed by 384 BACs (corresponding to 12,384-well library plates) for a total of 4,608 clones using the Illumina procedure. DNA from each plate pool was prepared using the Illustra TempliPhi Large Construct V2 kit (Resnova). Each BAC pool was then individually assembled as described below.Paired-end libraries were prepared by using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced in two lanes on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the 12-plex level of multiplexing, producing from 30 to 50 million reads per pool (paired-end 100-nt set-up). The processing of fluorescent images into sequences, base-calling, and quality value calculations was performed using the Illumina data-processing pipeline (version 1.8.2).Illumina reads were then processed to remove adapters using Cutadapt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cutadapt/1.4.2, 12 November 2014, date last accessed),23 with default parameters except -O 10 -n 2 -m 50 and finally paired again using an internally developed Python script. To trim low-quality regions and to remove bacterial contaminants and olive chloroplast sequence, reads were further processed with ERNE-FILTER (http://erne.sourceforge.net, 12 November 2014, date last accessed) using default parameters except–min-size 50 and —errors-rate 25.Illumina reads from each individual BAC pool were assembled using ABySS24 with the following parameters: k = 71, l = 1, aligner = map, b = 1,000,000, P = 0.95, s = 500, n = 10. An internally developed Perl script was used to remove scaffolds shorter than 500 nt.2.2. Identification of full-length LTR-REsAssembled contigs longer than 10,000 nt were surveyed for the identification of full-length LTR-REs based on structural features and sequence similarity to the Olea RE database18 and to public sequence databases (non-redundant nucleotide and protein NCBI databases, RepBase database).Structural features were identified using the LTR-FINDER25 and DOTTER26 software. Alignment boundaries were obtained by adjusting the ends of LTR-pair candidates using the Smith–Waterman algorithm. These boundaries were re-adjusted based on the occurrence of typical LTR-RE features that include the following: being flanked by the dinucleotides TG and CA at 5' and 3' ends, respectively; the presence of a target-site duplication (TSD) of 4–6 nt; a putative 15- to 18-nt PBS, complementary to a tRNA at the end of the putative 5'-LTR; and a 20- to 25-nt PPT just upstream of the 5' end of the 3' LTR.All putative LTR-REs were subsequently annotated by BLASTX and BLASTN against the public non-redundant databases at NCBI, and by RepeatMasker against the RepeatExplorer-based database of olive-repeated sequences.18 To limit false-positive detection, we used a fixed E-value threshold of E < 10-5 for BLASTN and E < 10-10 for BLASTX. The full-length REs that were identified as belonging to Gypsy or Copia superfamilies were then used as a reference database for a further BLASTN search, in order to classify previously unclassified elements.In other analyses, 10,000 nt upstream and downstream of each LTR-RE was subjected, whenever possible, to a BLAST search to identify other sequences (coding and/or non-coding) occurring in proximity of each RE.2.3. Estimation of LTR-RE abundanceTo estimate the redundancy of the LTR-RE set and of the Gypsy and Copia superfamilies, a large set of Illumina whole-genome shotgun reads (total coverage 8.1×)18 was mapped onto all isolated elements, using CLC-BIO Genomic Workbench 6.5.1, with the following parameters: mismatch cost = 1, deletion cost = 1, insertion cost = 1, similarity = 0.9, and length fraction = 0.9. To obtain reads of constant length, all bases exceeding 75 nt were cut. In this analysis, multireads (i.e. those reads that matched multiple distinct sequences) were distributed randomly, and hence, the number of mapped reads to a single sequence would be only an indication of its redundancy. On the other hand, if all sequences of a sequence class are taken together, the total number of mapped reads (in respect to total genomic reads) reveals the effective redundancy of that class.The redundancy level of each single sequence was estimated by mapping the same large set of Illumina whole-genome shotgun reads as above onto each isolated RE, one by one. Redundancy values are reported as the number of mapped reads per kb of sequence length.In other analyses, in order to evaluate the occurrence of solo-LTRs, the same read set was mapped onto each isolated RE one by one, keeping the 5'-LTR and the inter-LTR region separated.2.4. Phylogenetic analysesFull-length LTR-REs were scored for retrotranscriptase, RNAseH, and integrase domains of Gypsy and Copia elements—separately—using TBLASTN against an internally developed library of RE proteins. All sequences of at least 80 amino acids were collected and aligned using CLUSTALW,27 and a tree was generated. The tree was visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/, 12 November 2014, date last accessed).2.5. Insertion age calculation of full-length LTR-REsRE insertion age was estimated comparing the 5'- and 3'-LTRs of each putative RE. The two LTRs of a single RE are identical at the time of insertion because they are copied from the same template.A synonymous substitution rate was calculated comparing 20 protein-coding sequences (longer than 200 nt, putatively nuclear, and unique) of another species belonging to the Oleaceae family, Fraxinus excelsior (The British Ash Tree Genome Project, http://www.ashgenome.org/, 12 November 2014, date last accessed) to orthologous sequences of O. europaea, selected from an available olive transcriptome.28 Rates of synonymous nucleotide substitution for each gene sequence were calculated by the method of Nei and Gojobori29 with the Jukes–Cantor correction as implemented in the DnaSP program.30 As the estimated separation between Olea and Fraxinus is dated to between 40 and 45 MY ago,31 42.5 MY was used for estimating the synonymous nucleotide substitution rate.The two LTRs of each full-length RE were aligned with the ClustalW software,26 indels were eliminated, and the number of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site was calculated using an internally developed pipeline. As proposed by Ma and Bennetzen,32 we used twice the mean number of synonymous substitutions per site per year as the nucleotide substitution rate between LTRs. Based on this rate, the insertion time for each full-length RE was estimated.3. Results3.1. Isolation and annotation of full-length LTR-REsThe BAC library consisted of 44,928 clones with an average insert size of 112 kb. Considering the 1C genome size of O. europaea cv. Leccino (1.49 Gb, determined by DNA flow cytometry; J. Cížková, personal communication), the library should represent 3.3 genome equivalents.We sequenced a total of 4,608 clones in pools of 384 and, after assembly of each individual pool, we selected all contigs longer than 10 kb (275, for a total of 7,653,690 nt). These were scored for the occurrence of putative full-length LTR-REs, searching for structural features and sequence similarities, that is, the occurrence of two relatively intact LTRs, of identified PPT and PBS sites, and of flanking TSDs.A set of 254 putative full-length REs was isolated from 245 over 275 contigs (1 RE from each of 236 contigs and 2 REs from each of 9 contigs). We defined full-length elements based on the occurrence of intact ends, irrespective of whether these elements were potentially functional or contained inactivating mutations in their internal sequence (Table 1). Many sequences showed all distinctive structural features of REs, although in some cases one feature was missing. Mean characteristics of Copia, Gypsy, and unknown putative full-length retroelements identified in the BAC clonesMean characteristics of Copia, Gypsy, and unknown putative full-length retroelements identified in the BAC clonesThe isolated REs covered a total of 1,584,566 nt over 7,653,690 nt, with a mean length of 6226.5 nt. They were classified as Gypsy or Copia according to BLAST searches against NCBI, RepBase,33 and OLEAREP18 databases and to a subsequent BLAST search using the same olive REs as a reference database.The majority of isolated full-length REs belonged to the Copia superfamily (166), followed by the Gypsy superfamily (81, of which 36 contained an integrase chromodomain34). Seven REs were classified as unknown because they lacked distinctive protein-coding sequences suitable for classifying the element. For 222, 171, and 253 elements, the putative TSD, PBS, and PPT were identified, respectively. Seventy-two elements showed all typical protein domains of LTR-REs. The main features of each isolated RE are reported in Supplementary Data S1.Sequences adjacent to isolated REs were also scored for similarity to other genic or non-genic sequences. The occurrence of putative genes and transposon-related sequences is summarized in Table 2. In many cases (99 REs, 38.93%), the isolated full-length REs lied in proximity of gene sequences. Ninety-five REs (37.40%) were close to REs or DNA transposon fragments. Only 16 REs (6.30%) were flanked at both sides by transposon fragments, possibly representing loci with nested elements.

Genomic redundancy of isolated LTR-REsConsidering the percentage of Illumina reads that matched to a class of sequences as an indicator of the proportion of that class in the olive genome, previous experiments18 indicated that LTR-REs account for 38.8% of the olive genome. Using the same set of reads for mapping the 254 REs isolated from BAC clones, we found that they were mapped by 17,107,830 reads, corresponding to 12.3% of the genome, that is, these REs represent around one-third of the RE population in the genome.Mapping results of the different RE superfamilies are summarized in Fig. 1. In a previous work on olive genome,18 the ratio between redundancy of Gypsy and Copia REs was 1.17. In the RE sample described here, the ratio is quite different, amounting to 0.92, indicating that the REs identified in this study do not represent the whole olive RE set. However, it is worth noting that, although Gypsy full-length elements are only 81 versus 166 Copia elements, they are mapped by a number of reads similar to that mapping to the Copia REs. This result confirms that, in the olive genome, the number of Gypsy families is lower than that of Copia, but Gypsy REs are more redundant than Copia REs.18Number of full-length REs identified in this study, separated according to their superfamily. Each bar in the histogram shows the number of Illumina reads that matched to all REs (height) and the number of REs (width) of each superfamily.Number of full-length REs identified in this study, separated according to their superfamily. Each bar in the histogram shows the number of Illumina reads that matched to all REs (height) and the number of REs (width) of each superfamily.The distribution of the number of mapped reads of isolated Gypsy and Copia REs is reported in Fig. 2. Gypsy elements showed a larger mean and distribution around the mean compared with Copia.

The boxes represent the 25–75%, whiskers represent the whole range of values, and lines in the box represent the mean values of the distribution.To estimate the equilibrium between RE replication and RE loss, Illumina reads were mapped onto each full-length LTR-RE, keeping LTR sequences separate from the respective inter-LTR region. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3. Distribution of full-length olive LTR-REs according to the ratio between the number of mapped reads per kb measured separately on LTR and inter-LTR regions.Distribution of full-length olive LTR-REs according to the ratio between the number of mapped reads per kb measured separately on LTR and inter-LTR regions.The ratio between the numbers of mapped reads per kb between the 5'-LTR and the respective inter-LTR DNA sequence ranged from 0.003 to 20.52. If all REs belonging to the same family were intact, that is, composed of two LTRs and one inter-LTR region, the ratio should have been 2. Conservatively, we considered the occurrence of solo-LTRs only for those LTR-REs whose ratio was higher than 2.5. Only a small number of REs showed ratios higher than 2.5 (16 of 254—eight Gypsy, seven Copia, and one unknown element), and only three showed ratios higher than 10.Many LTR-REs showed a ratio lower than 2 (Fig. 3), that is, the inter-LTR region was more represented in the genome than in the LTR. This result suggests the presence of different families that share, at least in part, the inter-LTR region and show a higher level of sequence conservation of the pol protein-coding domains. Interestingly, Fig. 3 suggests that this aspect is especially true for Copia REs.Finally, one Copia and two Gypsy elements showed the highest ratio between the numbers of mapped reads per kb of the LTR and inter-LTRs (Fig. 3), indicating that unequal homologous recombination has particularly affected elements similar to these two REs. The Copia RE shows sequence similarity to Ale retroelements of other species and it is medium redundant. Both Gypsy REs show similarity to chromodomain-containing Res, and the estimated redundancy of the full-length forms of them is very high.3.3. Phylogenetic relationships among isolated LTR-REsPhylogenetic analyses were performed by the neighbour-joining method to evaluate the relationship between isolated LTR-REs. Two phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the transcribed putative retrotranscriptase sequence of 93 Copia and 43 Gypsy REs (Figs 4 and 5). The bootstrap values suggest the occurrence of distinct families, indicated in the figures by different colours.

The letter S indicates two Gypsy REs with an LTR/inter-LTR ratio of >10.The redundancy of each element is also reported in Figs 4 and 5. Within each family, especially for the Gypsy superfamily, different elements often showed similar redundancy. In many cases, the least redundant Copia elements did not cluster in the tree. In contrast, Gypsy unclustered elements were generally highly redundant. It should be noted that 9 of 20 Copia elements with mapped reads/kb >15,000 are reported in the retrotranscriptase tree, all belonging to the same, large cluster. In the other cases, they did not carry the RT-encoding domain. Using other RE protein domains, seven more Copia elements with mapped reads/kb >15,000 resulted in the same cluster (data not shown), indicating that the most redundant elements of this superfamily share some sequence similarity. Four of 20 most redundant REs did not carry protein domains, hence their relationship to the other sequences remained unknown.3.4. Putative insertion dates of LTR-REsIntact retroelements have a built-in molecular clock that is useful for estimating their insertion times, based on sister LTR divergence. In fact, when an RE is inserted into the genome, its LTRs are usually 100% identical. Considering that the retroelement transcription starts from the R region in the 5'-LTR and terminates at the end of the R region in the 3'-LTR (thus including only one copy of each U5 and U3 regions), the combination of single copy U5 and U3 regions with a hybrid R region during reverse transcription into cDNA yields two identical LTRs at both ends, prior to integration.12 Mutations then occur within the two LTRs, and as more time passes since the insertion, the larger the genetic distance between LTRs becomes. Hence, the RE insertion time can be estimated using a nucleotide substitution rate suitable for such elements, which is assumed to be higher than that of gene regions.32We estimated the synonymous substitution rate of genes in O. europaea by comparing orthologous cDNA sequences of O. europaea and F. excelsior (a species belonging to the Oleaceae family, for which a large amount of sequence data are available; Buggs and Sollars, personal communication), that is, 20 coding sequences for a total of 7,282 nt in O. europaea and 6,552 nt in Fraxinus (Supplementary Table S1). The mean number of synonymous substitutions per site (Ks) was 0.077.Based on the separation between the olive and the ash tree, estimated to be ~42.5 MY,31 the resulting synonymous substitution rate is 1.8 × 10-9, which is lower than those reported for herbaceous species, and similar to those of other perennial tree species.17,35 In fact, it is known that the generation time of a species affects its nucleotide substitution rate36 and trees have a much longer generation time than herbaceous species.It was proposed that mutation rates for LTR-REs may be approximately 2-fold higher than synonymous substitution rates for protein-coding genes.32 Consequently, in our calculations of LTR-RE insertion dates, we used a substitution rate per year of 3.6 × 10-9.The sequences of LTR pairs were compared and the putative insertion times were calculated for each full-length LTR-RE. Taking into account the whole set of full-length REs, the nucleotide distance (Ks) between sister LTRs showed a large variation between retroelements, representing a time-span of, at most, 46 MY. The putative mean age of analysed LTR-REs was 17.94 MY (standard error = 0.54 MY). The distribution of full-length LTR-REs according to their putative insertion date is reported in Fig. 6. Distributions of full-length REs identified in this study, according to their estimated insertion ages (MY). Mean insertion dates are reported in parentheses.Distributions of full-length REs identified in this study, according to their estimated insertion ages (MY). Mean insertion dates are reported in parentheses.Analysis of the insertion date profiles provides evidence for a partial overlap among retrotransposition waves of Gypsy and Copia full-length LTR-REs. For example, taking into consideration the last 7 MY, nearly all retrotransposition events involve Copia elements. On the other hand, Gypsy-related elements show a large peak of retrotransposition between 10 and 25 MY ago, in contrast to Copia REs, whose retrotransposition activity is scattered over the last 40 MY.Interestingly, two REs (one Copia and one Gypsy) did not show variations between their LTRs, suggesting that insertion should have occurred between 0 and 1.760 MY ago and between 0 and 0.387 MY ago, respectively, that is, the retrotransposition process could still be active.The relationship between the insertion age of an RE and its redundancy in the genome is shown in Fig. 7, and indicates the intensity of retrotransposition activity in the period in which retrotransposition has occurred, although the case that the insertion time of an element cannot correspond to the period of largest activity of its RE family cannot be ruled out. The relationship between estimated insertion ages (MY) and the redundancy of full-length REs identified in this study.The relationship between estimated insertion ages (MY) and the redundancy of full-length REs identified in this study.Figure 7 suggests that intense retrotransposition waves have occurred, for some RE families of both superfamilies, between 10 and 30 MY ago. One Gypsy and two Copia families may have been especially active between 23 and 29 MY ago.4. DiscussionThe repetitive component of the olive genome amounts to >70%.18 Around 30% of the genome is made of tandem repeat sequences and 40% of transposable elements. Such a genome composition appears to be peculiar to O. europaea. In other species, tandem repeats account for <10% of the genome, with the exception of the genome of cucumber,37 which is composed of ~23% of such sequences, a percentage, however, lower than that measured in the olive genome. In plant species other than olive, transposable elements account for the vast majority of the repetitive component. The partial replacement of REs by tandem repeats in the olive genome prompted us to study the dynamics of LTR-REs in this species.We analysed olive LTR-REs based on sister LTR identification in large contigs obtained assembling Illumina-sequenced BAC pools. By this approach, only putative full-length REs, that is, with two very similar LTRs, were scored. In total, we have isolated 254 full-length LTR-REs that can be added to the already available RE sequences.18The isolated full-length REs and their remnants represent 12.33% of the olive genome and constitute a particular fraction of these sequences. First, the sample of REs may have been biased by the assembly process. Repetitive elements represent the most difficult parts to assemble in any shotgun assembly project and are often under-represented in whole-genome assemblies. We assembled pools of 384 BACs that should on average each comprise 42,000 nt of genomic sequence, corresponding to <3% of the total genome size for olive. This should make the assembly of repetitive elements easier, even though difficulties may remain for high-copy sequences (that are represented in multiple copies within each pool) as well as for elements that have identical LTRs at their ends, where it may have been difficult to assemble a complete element with both LTRs. This may have affected not only the representation of different families and superfamilies, but also our estimation of insertion times of elements, because the REs with identical or nearly identical LTRs may not have been reconstructed as complete elements. Secondly, the method used to isolate full-length REs allowed us to select especially dispersed elements, whereas nested elements were probably under-represented in the sample, and it is known that nested REs constitute a large fraction of the repetitive component in medium- to large-sized genomes, such as those of maize38 or sunflower.16 It is possible that the REs isolated in this work are preferentially located in the gene-rich fraction of the olive genome, as suggested by the large number of protein-coding sequences that were found in the upstream or downstream region of REs. Nevertheless, the selected set of 254 full-length REs constitutes a valuable sample of these sequences, allowing an analysis of RE dynamics in this species.In angiosperms, Gypsy and Copia superfamilies are differently represented in the genome. Different ratios between Gypsy and Copia RE frequencies were reported,39 ranging from 5 : 1 in papaya40 to 1 : 2 in grapevine.41 Analysis of the whole olive genome showed a ratio of 1.17.18 The isolated olive full-length REs showed, on the contrary, a slight prevalence of Copia over Gypsy elements. This could be related to a different accumulation in genic and intergenic regions of the genome between Copia and Gypsy elements. In fact, Copia REs are often scattered on the chromosomes, whereas Gypsy elements preferentially accumulate—in a nested way—in specific chromosomal locations and structures, such as centromeric and pericentromeric regions.42 In this sense, the larger number of isolated Copia REs would be a consequence of the procedure used for RE identification. On the other hand, analysis of RE redundancy clearly showed that isolated full-length Gypsy elements, although at a lower number than Copia, account for a larger fraction of the genome, suggesting that they are more redundant, and confirming the previously reported results.18The occurrence of RE families in the olive genome was established according primarily to sequence similarity of their RT-coding sequences. Although, in many cases, bootstrap values were <50%, the trees suggest the occurrence of a number of RE clusters. It is to be noted that the most redundant elements (both Gypsy and Copia) are clustered, indicating that the corresponding families have been highly active during olive genome evolution.The relatively low frequency of REs in the olive genome could be related to a low rate of retrotransposition, but also to RE loss.43 RE DNA removal is driven in plants by a number of mechanisms, including DNA rearrangements and unequal homologous recombination; solo-LTRs are the main products of such processes.32,44,45Analysing the relative redundancy of LTRs and inter-LTR regions in the same full-length RE allowed us to evaluate the occurrence of solo-LTRs related (i.e. belonging to the same family) to that RE. Solo-LTRs related to the isolated full-length REs were rare: only 16 of 254 REs showed a ratio between the number of mapped reads per kb of LTR and inter-LTR >2.5. The LTR/inter-LTR ratios of Gypsy elements were generally higher than those of Copia. These ratios were especially high for one Copia and two Gypsy elements, sharing sequence similarity with chromodomain-containing and Ale REs of other species, indicating the occurrence of a large number of solo-LTRs for RE families that are related to these full-length elements. However, the presence of REs sharing LTRs but not internal regions cannot be ruled out and could lead to an overestimation of solo-LTR frequencies.If genome size derives from an equilibrium between enlargement (by polyploidization and RE amplification) and reduction (by DNA loss) in olive, the genome size was increased by massive amplification of REs and of tandem repeats.18 This increase was partly counterbalanced by DNA loss, related to both Gypsy and Copia elements, in contrast to other species in which solo-LTRs have been found especially in Copia elements, as, for example, in sunflower.46,47Concerning the amplification of REs, the identification of sister LTRs allowed us, for the first time, to date the insertion of REs in the olive genome, using the method established by SanMiguel et al.19 in maize. Obviously, the estimation of insertion time by the number of mutations in sister LTRs is subject to error, because it assumes that the same mutation rates operate in all retroelements and chromosome positions, while that was not proved to be true in, for example, the genus Oryza.48 However, this method appears as the most suitable to study RE dynamics.Analysis of sister LTR similarity indicates that, in olive, both Gypsy and Copia REs have been active in the same period. Nearly, all the identified full-length elements appear to be mobilized in a time-span of 40 MY (Fig. 4), although it is conceivable that more ancient REs are not easily recognizable because of accumulation of variability between sister LTRs.The mean insertion date of olive Copia full-length REs is lower than that of Gypsy. The insertion date profiles indicate that, during the last 40 MY, Copia and Gypsy REs have both been active, but with different time courses. For example, only one isolated Gypsy full-length RE inserted between 1 and 8 MY ago. Moreover, the percentage of Gypsy REs inserted between 10 and 25 MY ago, and hence, presumably, their retrotransposition activity is by far larger than that of Copia elements. Different amplification histories of these RE superfamilies during the evolution of the host species have been reported in many plant species. De facto analysis of crop genomes in a phylogenetic context reveals scarce congruence in RE content and highlights differences in the success of different RE types.39In contrast to other species, such as maize14 and sunflower,49,50 in which the RE burst is very recent and probably still occurring, in the olive genome the insertion of new REs appears to be decreasing in frequency in the last 8 MY, for both Gypsy and Copia REs. A similar time course of the RE amplification wave was reported in the genome of a gymnosperm, the Norway spruce.35 While our estimates of insertion ages may have been biased against the most recent elements by the assembly process as discussed previously, it is to be considered that all those REs interrupted by other elements (i.e. presumably older than inserted ones) are not included in the sample. The observation of a considerable number of elements inserted >10 MY ago is still valid and represents a clear distinctive feature of the olive genome in comparison with other angiosperm genomes analysed so far.The relationship between insertion time of an element and its redundancy offers further insights into olive RE dynamics. Gypsy and Copia full-length REs inserted between 10 and 30 MY ago are by far the most abundant, while recently inserted elements show low levels of redundancy. This is expected because it is known that lowly redundant elements are more prone to escape RE silencing. The age distribution of REs further suggests a progressive reduction in RE activity from 20 MY ago until now.Dating the amplification process of another major repeat class in the olive genome, the tandem repeats, could clarify if a type of ‘competition’ in the genome colonization has occurred between repeat types during olive evolution.Concerning olive RE transcription, no data are currently available. Ancient LTR-REs are generally inactive or less active than young ones, probably because of the accumulation of mutations determining premature stop codons in the coding portion of the LTR-RE, as observed in rice.51 Moreover, there is also a strong control of RE activity by the host species; it has been established that REs are especially silenced by siRNA.52 It is plausible that the large number of LTR-RE fragments spread throughout the olive genome can produce siRNAs that silence related retroelements.In conclusion, our analyses show many aspects of RE dynamics in the evolution of the olive genome. Some data are similar to those observed in other plant species, but some peculiarities of the olive genome also emerged for this repeat class, besides the extreme redundancy of tandem repeats. All these data support the theory that if RE dynamics are similar, including birth through transposition, silencing and then death by both random mutation and possibly deletion from the genome,53 the factors inducing such dynamics might be different in different RE lineages and possibly related to the ‘ecosystem’ in which the REs interact and compete.54 Hence, according to Venner et al.,55 olive REs can be considered a community of different organisms in the genome, with ‘species’ (corresponding to RE superfamilies) and ‘subspecies’, characterized by different LTR sequences, activity, and evolution history.5.

IntroductionCell-surface polysaccharides play an essential role in the ability of bacteria to survive and persist in the environment and in host organisms.1 The O-antigen polysaccharide constitutes the outermost part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The chemical composition and structure of the O-antigen exhibit high levels of variation even within a single species.2–5 This observation is corroborated by the huge serological variation of somatic O antigens. Currently, the O serogrouping, sometimes combined with H (flagellar) antigens and K (capsular polysaccharide) antigens, is a standard method for subtyping of Escherichia coli strains in taxonomical and epidemiological studies. In particular, identification of strains of the same O serogroup is a prerequisite to start any actions for outbreak investigations and surveillance.Thus far, the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Escherichia and Klebsiella based at the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) in Denmark (http://www.ssi.dk/English.aspx) has recognized 184 E. coli O serogroups. It is generally believed that the O serogrouping of E. coli strains provides valuable information for identifying pathogenic clonal groups, especially for public health surveillance. For example, O157 is a leading O serogroup associated with enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and is a significant food-borne pathogen worldwide.6,7 Other important EHEC O serogroups include O26, O103, and O111.8 The Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O104:H4 was found responsible for a large human food-borne disease outbreak in Europe, 2011.9 Another notable example is strains of serogroup O25; extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing, multidrug-resistant E. coli O25:H4 has emerged worldwide to cause a wide variety of community and nosocomial infections.10In E. coli, the genes required for O-antigen biosynthesis are clustered at a chromosomal locus flanked by the colanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster (wca genes) and the histidine biosynthesis (his) operon. Generally, the O-antigen biosynthesis genes fall into three classes: (i) the nucleotide sugar biosynthesis genes, (ii) the sugar transferase genes, and (iii) those for O-unit translocation and chain synthesis (wzx/wzy in the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway and wzm/wzt in the Wzm/Wzt-dependent ABC transporter pathway).11 To date, >90 types of O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster (O-AGC) sequences have been determined, with the majority derived from major human and animal pathogens.12 Sequence comparisons of these O-AGCs indicate a great variety of genetic structures. Several studies have provided evidence to show that horizontal transfer and replacement of a part or all of the O-AGC have caused shifts in O serogroups.13–15 Alternatively, point mutations in the glycosyltransferase genes in the O-AGC or acquisition of alternative O-antigen modification genes, which are located outside of the O-AGC, have also been shown to result in structural alterations of O antigen and concomitant change in the serotype of the isolate.16,17Genes or DNA sequences specific for each O serogroup can be used as targets for the identification of O serogroups via molecular approaches, such as PCR-based and hybridization-based methods. Such systems have already been developed by several researchers to target specific O-antigen types.12,18–20 In particular, molecular assays targeting major O serogroups are routinely used in EHEC surveillance for clinical or food sample screening. Considering the range of diseases caused by E. coli strains belonging to many different serogroups, a more comprehensive and detailed O-AGC information for the complete set of E. coli O serogroups is of significant clinical importance for generating a rational molecular typing scheme. This molecular typing scheme, which could be performed in silico directly on sequence data, also offers a mechanism with which to link the ever-expanding genomic data to our extensive epidemiological and biological knowledge of this pathogen, based on O-antigen typing. Moreover, these data will also provide a much better understanding of the complex mechanisms by which a huge diversity in O serogroups have arisen. Here, we present a complete sequence set for the O-AGCs from all 184 E. coli O serogroups, which include recently added serogroups (O182–O187), providing a complete picture of the O-AGC diversity in E. coli.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains, culture condition, and DNA preparationReference strains of all 184 recognized E. coli O serogroups were obtained from SSI (see Supplementary Table S1). Cells were grown to the stationary phase at 37°C in Luria–Bertani medium. Genomic DNA was purified using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.2. O-AGC sequences and comparative analysesOne hundred and eight E. coli O-AGC sequences were determined by Sanger-based capillary sequencing and/or Illumina MiSeq sequencing from PCR products covering O-AGCs (Supplementary Table S1). The O-AGC regions of the reference strains were amplified by PCR using 10 ng of genomic DNA as template with the Tks Gflex DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.) by 25 amplification cycles for 10 s at 98°C and for 16 m at 69°C, and with a combination of three forward primers (TATGCCAGCGGCACCAAACG, ATACCGGCGATGAAAGCC, and GCGGGTGGGATTAAGTCTCT) designed on the hisFI genes and two reverse primers (GTGATGCAGGAATCCTCTGT and CCACGCTAATTACGCCATCTT) designed on the wcaM genes, or strain-specific primers designed based on the draft genome sequences determined using the MiSeq system from reference strains. Identification and functional annotation of the CDSs were performed based on the results of homology searches against the public, non-redundant protein database using BLASTP. The sequences reported in this article have been deposited in the GenBank database (accession no. AB811596-AB811624, AB812020-AB812085, and AB972413-AB972425). The other 76 E. coli O-AGC sequences were obtained from public databases. For a list of accession numbers, see Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Phylogenetic analysisMultilocus sequence typing (MLST) was carried out according to the protocol described on the E. coli MLST website (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli), and the phylogenetic relationships of reference strains were analysed based on the concatenated sequences (3,423 bp) of seven housekeeping genes (adk, fumC, gyrB, icd, mdh, purA, and recA) used for MLST. Multiple alignments of DNA and amino acid sequences were constructed by using the CLUSTAL W program.21 Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the neighbour-joining algorithm using the MEGA4 softrware.223. Results3.1. Genetic structures of the O-AGCs from all E. coli O serogroupsOf the 184 known O serogroups, 76 complete O-AGC sequences were obtained from public databases. The sequence of the other 108 O-AGC was determined in this study from E. coli O-serogroup reference strains (Supplementary Table S1). Our analysis of these sequences confirmed several previously observed characteristics of O-AGCs in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. S1). In brief, O-AGCs are located between the wca and his operons. This region contains three housekeeping genes: galF (encoding UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase), gnd (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), and ugd (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase), and most genes for O-antigen biosynthesis in each cluster are directly flanked by galF and gnd/ugd, while gne (UDP-GalNAc-4-epimerase) and wzz (O-antigen chain length determination protein) located immediately outside of the region between galF and gnd/ugd (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The exceptions for this are the O-AGCs for O serogroups O14 and O57, which contain no O-antigen genes at the typical locus. However, it is known that the E. coli O14 reference strain Su4411-41 shows an O rough phenotype and lacks the O-AGC.23 For O57, a further analysis is also required to investigate the presence of O-antigen structure in the LPS of the reference strain. Our data revealed that the O-AGCs located between galF and gnd ranged in size from 4.5 kbp (O155, including four genes) to 19.5 kbp (O108, including 18 genes).Genes required for the deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-sugar biosynthesis pathway (rmlBDAC) to synthesize dTDP-l-rhamnose (dTDP-l-Rha), the precursor of l-Rha, were widely distributed in the O-AGCs (conserved in 56 O-serogroup O-AGCs; see Supplementary Fig. S1). The vioAB operon, for the biosynthesis of dTDP-N-acetylviosamine (dTDP-VioNAc), the precursor of VioNAc, was present in three O-serogroup O-AGCs; the fnlABC operon for the synthesis of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetyl-l-fucosamine (UDP-l-FucNAc), the precursor of l-FucNAc, was in 11 O-serogroup O-AGCs; the fnlA-qnlBC genes for the synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-l-quinovosamine (UDP-l-QuiNAc), the precursor of l-QuiNAc, were in four O-serogroup O-AGCs; the nnaDBCA genes for synthesis of cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminate (CMP–NeuNAc), the precursor of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid), were found in six O-serogroup O-AGCs (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, a gene set comprising seven genes putatively involved in the synthesis of di-N-acetyl-8-epilegionaminic acid (8eLeg5Ac7Ac) were found in three O-serogroup O-AGCs. For at least 49 O serogroups, gene sets for nucleotide sugar biosynthesis were not found in their O-AGCs (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that, in these serogroups, nucleotide sugars required for O-antigen biosynthesis were synthesized by pathways encoded by the genes located outside of the O-AGCs.Each O-AGC contained two to six genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases for synthesizing O-antigen subunits and a total of 611 glycosyltransferase genes identified in all O-AGCs. Pfam analysis revealed that at least 25 types of glycosyltransferase-related domains were found in the 611 glycosyltransferase genes (Supplementary Table S2). ‘Glycosyl transferases group 1’ (PF00534) and ‘Glycosyl transferase family 2’ (PF00535) were the most widely distributed domains, which were found in 216 and 253 genes, respectively. Except for the five genes belonging to ‘Glycosyltransferase family 52’ (PF07922), which were found in five of the six nnaDBCA-containing O-AGCs (O24, O56, O104, O131, and O171), there were no relationships between the type of glycosyltransferase-related domain and the gene set for sugar synthesis in each O-AGC.All O-AGCs carried either wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt gene pairs. Of the 182 O-AGCs (the above-mentioned O14 and O57 were excluded from the 184 clusters analysed in this study), 171 carried the wzx/wzy genes, and the other 11 carried the wzm/wzt genes (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). Detailed sequence comparisons of the wzx/wzy and wzm/wzt genes are described below.3.2. Grouping the O-AGCs by sequenceOn the basis of sequences and genetic structures of the entire O-AGC regions, in addition to 145 unique O-AGCs from different E. coli O serogroups, the O-AGCs from 37 O serogroups could be placed into 16 groups (named Gp1–Gp16) with the members of each group having identical or very similar O-AGC genes (mostly sharing =95% DNA sequence identity) (Fig. 1). This included nine groups with members of different serogroups but which carried identical O-AGC gene sets (Gp1–Gp9) and one group, Gp10, where two strains (O13 and O129) of the three-member group carried an identical O-AGC gene set (sharing 98.3–99.9% DNA sequence identity) (Fig. 1). The reason(s) why they belong to different O serogroups even though they have identical O-AGCs are discussed in the Discussion section. Indels or exchange of one or more genes was also shown to explain the differences between O135 and other members of Gp10 and members Gp11–Gp16, which otherwise carried highly conserved orthologous genes (summarized in Fig. 1). Simple insertions of insertion sequence (IS) elements containing one or two transposase genes were found in three groups without any gene disruption: an IS629 insertion in O18ab of Gp12, ISEc11 in O164 of Gp13, and IS1 in O62 of Gp14. IS element-associated replacement of the right-end portion of the O-AGC had occurred in three groups, Gp14, Gp15, and Gp16, resulting in the replacement (or deletion) of glycosyltransferase gene(s). Exchange of the wzx gene had also occurred in Gp16. These data suggest that IS elements are important drivers for generating O-antigen biosynthesis gene replacement and therefore diversity.

Diversity and specificity of the wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt genes among the E. coli O-AGCsAs previously proposed,12 most wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt orthologues showed high levels of sequence diversity and their sequences were unique to each O-AGC or O-AGC group described above (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). DNA sequence identities of the closest pairs were <70%, except for the O96/O170 pair, the wzx genes of which showed 86% DNA sequence identity. Within the 16 O-AGC groups, the orthologous wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt genes also showed high sequence conservation (=95% DNA sequence identity, but mostly =97% identity), except for Gp16 that shared only the wzy gene (Fig. 2).

Phylogenetic relationships of E. coli O-serogroup reference strainsBased on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of seven housekeeping genes used for MLST, we determined the evolutionary relationships of all E. coli O-serogroup reference strains (Fig. 3). This analysis revealed that the members of five groups sharing the common O-AGCs (Gp8, Gp10, Gp11, Gp14, and Gp15) and two members (O17 and O77) of Gp9 were found in closely related lineages. However, the members of other groups (and three members of Gp9) were found in distinct evolutionary lineages. For example, O20 and O137, both carrying the Gp1 O-AGC, were found in two distinct lineages, each belonging to phylogroups A and E/D, respectively, and five serogroups (O17/O77, O44, O73, and O106) belonging to Gp9 were found in multiple lineages (A, E/D, and B1). Correlation between the Escherichia coli evolutionary lineages and the distribution of O-AGCs. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping genes from all 184 E. coli O-serogroup reference strains. The group names of O-AGCs (Gp1–Gp16) are indicated in the outermost region. Members in groups indicated in green were found to belong to the same or very closely related lineage, whereas members of the groups indicated in blue were found in distinct lineages. The outer circle next to the O serogroup names indicates the distribution of sugar synthesis gene sets identified in each O-AGC. The inner circle indicates the type of O-antigen processing system (wzx/wzy or wzm/wzt). Phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, D, and E) were determined by comparing the sequences of the strains tested with the known sequences from the ECOR collection (http://mlst.warwick.ac.uk/mlst/dbs/Ecoli).Correlation between the Escherichia coli evolutionary lineages and the distribution of O-AGCs.

Additionally, three clonal groups containing five or more reference strains were also identified in phylogroups A (ST34 and ST57) and B1 (ST300) (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic analysis also showed that the types of sugar synthesis gene sets and processing gene sets (wzx/wzy and wzm/wzt) were not limited to a specific lineage (Fig. 3).3.5. Relationships of the E. coli and Shigella O-AGCsShigella and E. coli belong to the same species complex24 and many Shigella O antigens are known to be serologically and genetically identical or very similar to some E. coli O antigens, as summarized by Liu et al.25 In addition to the 21 previously shown relationships, we found two additional O-AGC groups shared by E. coli and Shigella; O38 and Shigella dysenteria type 8 (SD8), and O169/O183 and Shigella boydii type 6/10 (SB6/SB10) (Supplementary Fig. S4). The O183-AGC was highly similar to the S. boydii types 10 cluster (sharing 98.2% DNA sequence identity). In our previous study,26 we provisionally named a novel O serogroup for a group of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains as OSB10, which cross-reacted with S. boydii type 10. Sequence comparisons in this study revealed that OSB10 is not only serologically but also genetically identical to the new serogroup O183 of Gp16.4. DiscussionMuch of what we know about E. coli is defined at some level by O serogroups. To link genomic information to the wealth of data held in public databases, in our collective knowledge, outbreak, and disease reports and elsewhere, we endeavoured to determine whether molecular O-serogroup identification, targeting O-serogroup-specific genes (or unique sequences), was a valuable method to capture this information and maintain this important link. Not only do we show evidence supporting the effectiveness of molecular O-typing, but also we open up the possibility of generating a molecular O-typing scheme and relate O serogroups to the underlying phylogeny of this bacterium.By determining and comparing the sequences of O-AGCs from all known E. coli O serogroups, we newly defined the sequence and gene content of 145 unique O-AGCs and showed that O-AGCs from 37 O serogroups could be placed into 16 groups based on members in each group sharing nearly identical or highly similar O-AGCs. It is clear from these data that many of the grouped O-AGCs (Gp1-16) were found in distinct phylogenetic lineages indicating that these O-AGCs have been spread across this species by horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, several lineages that contained multiple O serogroups, ST10, ST34, ST57, and ST300, show that frequent exchange occurs between and within lineages. ST10 and its close relatives are particularly interesting as one-quarter of E. coli O-serogroup reference strains fell within this clonal group. ST10 and its clonal complex are clinically very important being recently found to include ESBL-producing E. coli from human and animals in Spain,25 Italy and Denmark,26 China,27 and the Netherlands,28 and in various intra-intestinal pathotypes of E. coli, such as enteroaggregative E. coli,27,28 enterotoxigenic E. coli,29,30 and EHEC.31,32 In most cases, the O serogroups of these ST10 or ST10-related strains are unusual compared with the typical O serogroups that represent that pathotype.Acquisition of O-antigen modification genes located on the genomes of serotype-converting bacteriophages or plasmids is also an important strategy for diversifying O-antigen structures. This mechanism has been well investigated in Shigella flexneri.33,34 In E. coli, the O-serogroup conversion by a prophage-like element has been reported for O17 and O44,17 which belong to Gp9 defined in this study. Another possible mechanism to generate the variation of O antigens is the mutations in the genes of the O-AGC as observed for O107 and O117,16 which belong to Gp8. In this case, point mutations in a glycosyltransferase gene are responsible for the alteration of O-antigen structure (and thus that of O serogroup).16 Five O-AGC groups including Gp2, Gp5, Gp7, Gp12, and Gp13 also contained differences in the amino acid sequence of their glycosyltransferases. O serogroup differences in these groups may be generated by the point mutations in glycosyltransferase genes. On the other hand, all glycosyltransferase genes in Gp1, Gp3, Gp4, Gp6, and Gp11; four strains from Gp9 (O17, O44, O73, and O77) and two from Gp10 (O13 and O129) showed 100% amino acid sequence identity. These results suggest that the serological differences between the members of these seven groups have been generated by acquisition of modification genes outside of the O-AGC as shown for O17 and O44 of Gp9.17We believe that the remarkable sequence diversity observed in the wzx/wzy and wzm/wzt O-AGC genes of all known E. coli O serogroups appears to be sufficiently discriminative from one another to make identification of each of the known O serogroups possible. Therefore, our sequence data will serve as a valuable resource for the development of rationally designed molecular methods for O-typing as well as for detecting novel O serogroups.In conclusion, our study provides a complete sequence set of O-AGCs of all known E. coli O serogroups and thus offers a full view on the genetic diversity of O-AGCs of this bacterium. In addition, the results presented suggest that horizontal gene transfer has been involved in the O serogroup diversification in E. coli more frequently and in a more biased or lineage-dependent fashion than previously thought.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Health Labor Sciences Research Grants from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Japan to A.I.

IntroductionData mining of extensive genome-scale databases, such as the Human Epigenome Atlas,1 ENCODE,2 Eukaryotic Promoter Database,3 DBTSS,4 database on CpG islands,5 FANTOM5,6 and many others, cannot be performed without efficient bioinformatic tools. Typically, the researcher is interested in finding correlations between various characteristics distributed over the genome (commonly termed genome tracks). The trends in the close or remote positioning between genomic features may indicate their coordinated action in chromatin packing, recombination, replication, or transcription.7 The features on the genome can be presented as points [e.g. transcription start sites (TSS), DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), contacts between chromosomes], stretches (transposons, exons and introns, CpG islands), or profiles defined throughout the sites (expression profiles, protein-binding profiles). The stretches can be described in terms of their lengths and positions of some characteristic points (starts/centres/ends). The effects related to these two parameters (overlapping and positioning of stretches) should be studied separately. A part of correlational analysis related to the mutual positioning of starts/centres/ends of stretches can also be reduced to the study of point distributions. The processing of profiles is rather complicated. The processing of data from several experiments and data on the background noise results in identifying the maxima in profiles or the significant regions distributed over the genome. Such maxima and regions can further be treated as points and stretches. Therefore, the general assessment of correlations between features of two types always includes an estimation of the closeness between two point sets.Despite the seemingly simple formulation, such analysis remains a challenge.8–10 The distribution of distances between consecutive genome track elements proved to be significantly different from that in the reference random model, with the variations in lengths between consecutive genomic elements being much stronger than the approximately homogeneous distribution of randomly positioned elements (see Results). In this sense, the distribution of genome track elements may be called inhomogeneous. The strong inhomogeneity in the distribution of genomic features over the genome, which is inherent to most genetic data, hampers statistical analysis. The application of simple and standardized methods, such as correlation functions, needs the coarse graining of data over 10–100 kb bins11 and smears the resolution of correlations. The proper approach should be based on the relevant statistical criteria. The developed analytical criteria and respective packages ought to be robust against the spatial inhomogeneity of feature distribution.Among the available packages, the Genomic HyperBrowser12,13 is based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the assessment of the statistical significance of correlations between genome tracks of two types, whereas GenometriCorr14 uses the combination of statistically grounded analytical criteria with a permutation test. The application of simulations generally needs at least two rounds of simulations with an enhanced number of realizations to prove the statistical convergence of a method and is rather time consuming. The simulations are difficult to implement for the study of large genome-scale data sets. In contrast to packages based on the simulations, packages based on the analytical criteria (i.e. on the mathematical expressions derived in advance) do not need a large number of trial realizations for assessment of statistical significance and, therefore, save a lot of computational time.Primarily, we were interested in the applications of available packages to the particular correlations between DSBs and epigenetic features. We began by testing available packages. In a random independent set of points, the position of each point does not depend on the positions of other random points or on the positions of points of any other (random or not) set. Thus, if at least one of two sets is random and independent, correlations between the two sets should be absent. Testing of both packages, Genomic HyperBrowser and GenometriCorr, for the absence of correlations between a random independent set and a strongly inhomogeneous, non-random genomic set revealed that the packages may indicate artificial correlations in this case. Moreover, as both packages do not suggest a measure for assessment of intrinsic inhomogeneity, the attribution between a random set and a non-random inhomogeneous set is not known a priori. If the true attribution was permuted, the correct assessment of correlations actually failed in both packages. The failure is perhaps related to problems in statistical assessment. Note that our remarks are concerned only with the particular options in the Genomic HyperBrowser and GenometriCorr corresponding to the study of correlations between two point sets. Therefore, we were prompted to develop an original statistical algorithm and package, the Genome Track Analyzer, based on this algorithm. Our package is freely available at http://ancorr.eimb.ru/. The usage of the analytical criteria permits the rapid processing of large-scale data. We tried to formulate our resulting analytical criteria in terms of Gaussian z-statistics that is familiar to most researchers.The testing of available packages and the study of particular examples proved that the assessment of genome track inhomogeneity and the robustness of the algorithm against inhomogeneity are crucial for the correct analysis of correlations between genome tracks. In this article, we present the quantitative measure for inhomogeneity of genome tracks, robust statistical criteria, and an algorithm for the analysis of correlations between two genome tracks, and we compare the different packages. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our package to the study of particular correlations between different genetic and epigenetic features related to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Among our particular applications, the correlations between CpG islands and TSS are well studied and serve in our work mainly as an additional test, whereas the correlations between TSS on the forward and reverse strands in eukaryotic genomes, as well as the correlations between DSBs and H3K4me3 marks in the Homo sapiens genome, can be considered as original. The correlations between protein-binding profiles for Drosophila melanogaster were likely not studied using the similar statistical methods. They reflect the mutual dependence between features that was established experimentally. The correlations between particular genomic tracks obtained with the Genomic HyperBrowser and GenometriCorr were compared with that obtained using our package.2. Materials and methodsIn this section, we describe the basic theory and the main algorithm. The genome tracks proved to be often inhomogeneous and strongly different from quasi-homogeneous random distributions. We present the quantitative criteria for assessment of genome track inhomogeneity. The algorithm developed in this article is robust against inhomogeneity effects. It is implied that, after preprocessing (Preprocessing of input genetic data), the genetic data will correspond to the set of points that divides the genome (or a genome region) under study into a set of fragments.2.1. Reference model2.2. Assessment of genome track inhomogeneity2.3. Ordering of genomic features2.4. Preprocessing of input genetic dataIf the input genetic data correspond to the particular sites, e.g. sites of DSBs, TSS, etc., they are commonly used without additional preprocessing. If needed, preliminary clustering of points can be performed.The stretches, such as CpG islands, transposons, etc., are replaced by points in the starts/centres/ends of the stretches. The overlapping of stretches is permissible. The mean distance between consecutive reference points should be much longer than the characteristic length of stretches.2.5. AlgorithmThe analysis shows that most genetic data are strongly inhomogeneous, i.e. the variations in lengths corresponding to genome tracks are stronger than that corresponding to the random division of the genome in the same number of fragments (Assessment of genome track inhomogeneity). Therefore, the criteria and algorithm for assessment of mutual correlations between two genome tracks should be robust against inhomogeneity of corresponding length distributions. The algorithm presented below satisfies this requirement.The subsequences (A)k or (B)k (k = 3) are discarded, because they cannot be associated with the neighbouring points of the other type. The subsequences AABB or BBAA are also discarded.This leaves us only two fundamental types of subsequences: ABA and BAB. All other possible sequences under consideration are their combinations. Our algorithm processes the entire sequence of points, splitting it into fundamental subsequences ABA and BAB from left to right. In the process of splitting, consequent fundamental subsequences can have only one common border letter, and they cannot overlap by two or more letters. For example, ABABA is split into ABA and ABA.In the subsequence BAB, the pair of the nearest neighbours is determined relative to the A point and corresponds to the minimum of two lengths in the combinations BA and AB, whereas in the subsequence ABA the pair of the nearest neighbours is determined relative to the B point and corresponds to the minimum of two lengths in the combinations AB and BA.3. Results3.1. Tests and comparison of different packagesThe distribution of genome tracks over the genome is often strongly inhomogeneous. As a typical example, we chose the exons on the forward and reverse strands of 23 human chromosomes (the Y-chromosome was discarded due to insufficient data). Both the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and entropy criteria revealed strong inhomogeneity of this set (Supplementary data S1). The positions of points in any random set are independent of that of exons and should be uncorrelated with them. This test was used to verify the predictions in different packages. For a particular MC realization, the P-value characterizing the significance of correlations between exons and a random set was calculated for each chromosome separately. The correlations were assumed to be significant if P < 0.05. Then, we calculated the observed fraction of events with predicted P < 0.05 per 100 MC realizations (false discovery rate, FDR). As neither Genomic HyperBrowser12,13 nor GeometriCorr14 suggests the criteria for the comparison of the inhomogeneity of two sets, we performed the blind computations in which the attribution of two sets was unknown.Statistical analysis of correlations between genome tracks with Genomic HyperBrowser was performed to test the hypothesis: point–point located nearby? The correlations in this package were assessed via MC simulations, in which one of the sets was preserved, whereas the other was replaced by MC samples. The maximal number of MC samples was 1,000. To create single-line commands suitable for batch processing, we used Perl scripts written by ourselves. GenometriCorr used the combination of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for the normalized lengths together with a permutation test for distances between the points of two sets. In GenometriCorr, the user should manually set the extreme 5'- and 3'-ends of the data range to define the limits of the chromosome region under study for correct correlations. This option is called ‘mapping’ and is turned off by default. For setting mapping, we used an R script written by ourselves. The number of permutations for the assessment of absolute distance P-value was 1,000. For our package, we used the united Gaussian criterion (23) with attribution of sets by the entropy z criterion (10). The results are compared in Table 1. FDR for the tests on the absence of correlations between exons in human chromosomes and random setsAll tests were performed with predicted P-values <0.05. The expected mean value and standard deviation for FDR per 100 MC realizations should be 0.05 ± 0.005.FDR, false discovery rate; MC, Monte Carlo; KS, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.FDR for the tests on the absence of correlations between exons in human chromosomes and random setsAll tests were performed with predicted P-values <0.05. The expected mean value and standard deviation for FDR per 100 MC realizations should be 0.05 ± 0.005.FDR, false discovery rate; MC, Monte Carlo; KS, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.The results in Table 1 reveal strong dependence of the FDR on the attribution of sets. If exon positions are preserved, while the random set is MC randomized, the Genomic HyperBrowser provides the FDR about five times higher than the expected rate. GenometriCorr provides the correct rate for the relative distance KS P-value and the correspondence exons—reference, random—query, whereas the usage of the absolute distance P-value provides the FDR ~2-fold higher than the expected rate at the same correspondence. The permutation in set attribution (i.e. the random set is preserved, while exon positions are MC randomized for the Genomic HyperBrowser and random—reference, exons—query for GenometriCorr) leads to the complete failure of the correlation prediction in both packages. This proves that the preliminary assessment of randomness/inhomogeneity is crucial for the correct statistical predictions.The computation time needed for one random realization in Genomic HyperBrowser was 1 h 35 min, in GenometriCorr 52 min, and in Genome Track Analyzer 9 s. This time included the duration of loading and processing of input data, direct computations, and processing of output data. In particular, for our package, the time needed for the loading and processing of input data was 8 s, and the processing of output data needed 1 s, whereas the direct computations took only 0.01 s.3.2. Correlations between CpG islands and TSSThe software package was applied to the analysis of particular genetic problems. The first one concerned the correlations between CpG islands and transcription start sites.5,22–24 The positions and overlapping of CpG islands with TSS affect gene expression in eukaryotes. The data on CpG islands on human chromosomes were taken from URL http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/CGI/,5 whereas the data on TSS were taken from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (http://epd.vital-it.ch/H. Sapiens hg19 version EPDnew 003).3 Our method supported the strong correlations between CpG islands and TSS with clear preceding ordering between 5'-ends of CpG islands and TSS. The study also showed overlap between CpG island and the nearest TSS (Supplementary data S2).3.3. Correlations between TSS on the forward and reverse strandsAdditionally, we found significant correlations between TSS on the forward and reverse strands of D. melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, H. sapiens, and Danio rerio (zebrafish) genomes. The positions of TSS on the reverse strand were projected to the forward strand. The detailed results are presented for D. melanogaster and H. sapiens. In Table 2, we included only the chromosomes in which the number of nearest neighbours exceeded 50 to ensure the applicability of Gaussian statistics. These data show clear positional and ordering correlations for the significant fraction of the TSS on two strands. Implying that expression regulation factors are upstream of TSS, the bias in projected TSS on the reverse strand preceding neighbouring TSS on the forward strand indicates that some regulatory elements such as CpG islands, enhancers, silencers, etc., may be common. Such a mode of regulation expression has, in fact, been experimentally established.25–27 The statistical significance of these correlations versus the counterpart random model proves the positive selection of such a mode of expression regulation during evolution. The fraction of the nearest neighbours for TSS turned out to be less than the theoretical prediction for the random sets with the same fractions of points [Equation (26)] for the H. sapiens genome and rather close to the theoretical prediction for the D. melanogaster genome (Table 2). The histograms for the relative and absolute lengths between neighbouring TSS, scattering plot, and the list of the top nearest TSS on the reverse and forward strands are summarized in Supplementary data S3. The histograms for both H. sapiens and D. melanogaster genomes show the length distributions peaked at the small distances between neighboring TSS in accordance with significant positional correlations. The histograms for the absolute lengths revealed a sharp drop at the distances exceeding the characteristic nucleosome length of ~200 bp. Though the absolute and relative lengths between neighbouring TSS were significantly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficients exceeded 0.7, P < 0.001), only the criteria formulated in terms of relative lengths proved to be robust against the inhomogeneity of genome tracks. The distribution of the nearest neighbouring TSS on the forward and reverse strands across particular chromosomes of the H. sapiens genome is shown in Fig. 1a, which was drawn with the Integrated Genome Browser.28 The distributions of the TSS pairs across all chromosomes of the H. sapiens genome listed in Table 2 can be found in Supplementary data S4. Correlations between transcription start sites on the forward and reverse strandsThe positions of TSS on the reverse strand were projected to the forward strand. z and zP are calculated by Equations (23) and (11) and characterize the positional and ordering correlations between TSS, respectively. The 1% significance thresholds for |z| and |zP| in the case of random correlations correspond to 2.58, while 5% significance thresholds correspond to 1.96. The positive values of zP indicate that projected TSS on the reverse strand precede TSS on the forward strand. The corresponding P-values were calculated using Gaussian statistics. The data were filtered by the number of pairs of the nearest neighbours (NN) exceeding 50 to ensure the applicability of Gaussian statistics.Correlations between transcription start sites on the forward and reverse strandsThe positions of TSS on the reverse strand were projected to the forward strand. z and zP are calculated by Equations (23) and (11) and characterize the positional and ordering correlations between TSS, respectively.

The data on binding sites for TF associated with genes were taken from http://www.genecards.org.The analysis of some nearest TSS duplets revealed that they correspond to rather short intergenic regions between pairs of closely located genes that reside on different strands. They may have mutual enhancers or bidirectional promoters, and thus should correspond to genes with coordinated expression. The particular examples are shown in Fig. 1b. Currently, we are analysing these gene pairs to determine the role of this type of genome organization for coordinated regulation of genes in the human genome.3.4. Correlations between protein-binding profilesThe second problem concerned the relationships between profiles characterizing DNA binding with proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and H3me3K27 marks in the chromosomes of D. melanogaster. E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc belong to the polycomb group (PcG) of proteins, which are important for maintaining the transcriptional repression of homeotic genes.29–32 The corresponding processed and aggregated profiles were obtained by Schwartz et al.29 and were taken from EMBL ArrayExpress accession E-MEXP-535.33 The profiles were preliminarily filtered by the cut-off threshold mean + 2 SD and clustered with a distance in the range 50–500 nt with steps of 50 nt (Preprocessing of input genetic data). The data before and after preprocessing with a clustering distance of 50 nt are shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding z-ratios [Equation (23)] indicate strong correlations between binding profiles for the PcG proteins and for H3me3K27 marks (Fig. 2b). The correlations strongly depend on the clustering distance (Fig. 2c and Supplementary data S5). As the characteristic binding region for the PcG proteins is ~50 nt,34 the clustering distance of 50 nt may be considered as optimal in this example. The cut-off threshold affects the number of nearest neighbours, but it retains the mode of correlations at a given clustering distance. These observations are in accordance with the data on the coordinate action of the E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc proteins, and the H3me3K27 marks in the silencing mechanisms for D. melanogaster.29,30(a) The binding profiles for proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and for H3me3K27 histone marks over chromosome 3R of Drosophila melanogaster.

The profiles were preliminary filtered by the cut-off threshold mean + 2 SD. The positive values of zcorr reflect a trend towards shorter distances between profiles relative to the reference model (or correlations), whereas the negative values of zcorr reflect a trend towards longer distances between profiles (or anticorrelations).(a) The binding profiles for proteins E(Z), Pc-S2, and Psc, and for H3me3K27 histone marks over chromosome 3R of Drosophila melanogaster.

Correlations between DSBs and histone marksFinally, we studied the relationships between DSBs and histone mark H3K4me3 in human chromosomes. DSBs induced by physical, chemical, or genetic agents provide important information about the large-scale organization of chromatin and may potentially be related to genomic stability, including translocations, deletions, or amplifications.35–37 H3K4me3 is a well-known, promoter-specific histone modification that is associated with transcription and active genes. Recently, it was demonstrated that this epigenetic mark selectively directs global TFIID recruitment to active genes, some of which are p53 targets.38 The data on nucleotide-resolved DSBs were submitted to GEO with accession number GSE53811. DSBs were preliminarily preprocessed: DSBs mapped below 5% and above 95% of coverage were cut-off; the remaining DSBs were clustered within a distance of 1 kb (Preprocessing of input genetic data). Such a clustering distance provides the distribution of lengths between consecutive DSBs, which is similar to that observed in gel electrophoresis.35,36 The profiles for histone marks were taken from ENCODE accession wgEncodeEH000953 in the pre-aligned format BAM and were then processed with MACS2.21 The MACS2 peak-caller was used with the option ‘callpeak’ for identifying significant regions (treated like stretches in our package). Then, the correlations of corresponding midpoints of stretches with DSBs were studied with our package. The summary of correlations is shown in Fig. 3 and reveals clear positional correlations between these features. Such correlations support the hypothesis regarding the relationships between DSBs and coordinated gene expression.35,36(a) The distributions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and H3K4me3 histone marks over human chromosome 7. The distributions of DSBs and histone marks were coarse-grained over bins of 100 kb, i.e. the heights in these distributions correspond to the number of points in the bins of 100 kb. Both sets were preprocessed as described in the main text. The distribution of cytobands across chromosome 7 is shown above the length scale. (b) z-ratios [Equation (23)] characterizing pairwise positional correlations between distributions of DSBs and H3K4me3 in the human chromosomes. The correlations for the Y-chromosome are not shown due to poor statistics. The numbers below the chromosome nomenclature correspond to that of the nearest neighbours. The horizontal broken lines for z-ratios correspond to 5% (z = 1.96) and 1% (z = 2.58) significance thresholds for random correlations.(a) The distributions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and H3K4me3 histone marks over human chromosome 7.

The comparison showed that the detected correlations appeared to be significant in all three packages (with minor divergence depending on the package and method). The significance of correlations in all packages indicates that they are real, non-artificial correlations. Generally, the coincidence of the correlation significance obtained with the different packages may depend on the particular chosen example (see Tests and comparison of different packages).4. DiscussionOur study proves that the proper treatment of inhomogeneity inherent to genome tracks is essential for the correct assessment of correlations between genome tracks. We tried a series of algorithms, including our variants and those suggested by others,12–14 and found that none of the algorithms that used absolute length scales satisfied the test for the absence of correlations between a random independent set and a strongly inhomogeneous non-random set (Tests and comparison of different packages and Table 1). The choice of the relative lengths with local normalization turned out to be crucial for the absence of correlations between a strongly inhomogeneous set and a random one. The significant inhomogeneity inherent to genome tracks and strong variations in characteristic lengths may be related to the large-scale chromatin organization (see Ref. 17 for discussion and further references).All z-criteria (10), (11), and (23) used in our package are based on the central limit theorem. The variations in the vicinity |z| = 2.7 proved to be approximately Gaussian for the random sets. The application of Gaussian criteria implies that the number of pairs of nearest neighbours, K, should be sufficiently large. The convergence can be assessed by the parameter 1/K<U+2060>. We determined that 50–100 representatives or more are sufficient for Gaussian approximation in the corresponding z-criteria. For the small sets, the statistical scattering becomes large and the deviations from Gaussian statistics may be significant. As the tails of distributions for z-ratios are non-Gaussian, we used the coarse-grained scale for the presentation of significance for output z-values: |z| < 1.8, insignificant; 1.8< |z| <1.96, fuzzy; 1.96< |z| <2.58, significant; and |z| > 2.58, highly significant. In the visual presentation of the software, all grades are marked by different colours.Our analytical criteria proved to be robust against the inhomogeneous distribution of lengths corresponding to genome tracks, which is typical of genetic problems. The analytical criteria significantly shorten the time of computational analysis and permit the study of larger data sets in comparison with MC simulations (Tests and comparison of different packages). Note that the analysis of large output data arrays needs the application of extreme value statistics for the assessment of their statistical significance. For example, in the case of random correlations, ~5% of output z-values can exceed the threshold |z| >1.96. Generally, the distribution of the large output array of z-values can be compared with Gaussian distribution by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion.A similar approach can be applied to the study of distributions of nucleotide content or DNA physico-chemical characteristics over the genome. In the latter case, these parameters should, initially, be coarse-grained over a window of length W. The distribution of parameters over consecutive non-overlapping windows can further be treated in line with profile preprocessing (Preprocessing of input genetic data). If needed, the continuous criteria used in our package can be replaced by their corresponding discrete counterparts.17 In the next step, we will include the more detailed analysis of correlations between stretches that are characterized by both the positions of the stretch centres and the overlap of stretches. To conclude, the Genome Track Analyzer provides an efficient tool for the study of correlations between genome features with useful applications to many genetic problems. The study of correlations between genome tracks may shed light on the intricate regulation networks in the different organisms.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Russian Fund of Basic Research (grant number 14-04-01638) and a grant from the Molecular and Cellular Biology Program of the Russian Academy of Sciences.The authors are grateful to A.
